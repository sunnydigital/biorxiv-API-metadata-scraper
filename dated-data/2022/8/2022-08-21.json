Despite the advances, their roles in the context of small-molecule drug discovery need to be thoroughly explored. In this study, we evaluated whether the AI-based models can lead to reliable three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes. The structure we predicted was NLRP3, a challenging protein target in terms of obtaining the three-dimensional model both experimentally and computationally. The conformation of the binding pockets generated by the AI models were carefully characterized and compared with experimental structures. Further molecular docking results indicated that AI-predicted protein structures combined with molecular dynamics simulations can be useful in small-molecule drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "The Michaelis-Menten (MM) rate law has been the dominant paradigm of modeling biochemical rate processes for over a century with applications in biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, systems biology, and chemical engineering. The MM rate law and its remedied form stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) much faster than the molecular concentrations change. Yet, this assumption is not always justified. Here, we relax this quasi-steady state requirement and propose the generalized MM rate law for the interactions of molecules with active concentration changes over time. Our approach for time-varying molecular concentrations, termed the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), is based on rigorously estimated time-delay effects in molecular complex formation. With particularly marked improvements in protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction modeling, the ETS provides an analytical framework to interpret and predict rich transient or rhythmic dynamics (such as autogenously-regulated cellular adaptation and circadian protein turnover), which goes beyond the quasi-steady state assumption.",

    "abstract": "Despite an increasing number of studies highlighting the impacts of climate change on boreal species, the main factors that will drive changes in species assemblages remain ambiguous. We quantify two climate-induced pathways based on direct and indirect effects on species occupancy and assemblage dis-similarity under different harvest management scenarios. The direct climate effects illustrate the impact of climate variables while the indirect effects are reflected through the changes in land cover composition. To understand the main causes in assemblage dissimilarity, we analyze the regional and the latitudinal species assemblage dissimilarity by decomposing it into balanced variation in species occupancy and occurrence and occupancy and occurrence gradient. We develop empirical models to predict the distribution of more than 100 bird and beetle species in the Cote-Nord region of Quebec over the next century. Our results show that the two pathways are complementary and alter biodiversity, mainly caused by balanced variation in species occupancy and occurrence. At the regional scale, both effects have an impact on decreasing the number of winning species. Yet, responses are much larger in magnitude under mixed climate effects (a mixture of direct and indirect effects). Regional assemblage dissimilarity reached 0.77 and 0.69 under mixed effects versus 0.09 and 0.10 under indirect effects for beetles and birds, respectively, between RCP8.5 and baseline climate scenarios when considering harvesting. Therefore, inclusion of climatic variables considers aspects other than just those related to forest landscapes, such as life cycles of animal species. Latitudinally, assemblage dissimilarity increased following the climate conditions pattern. Our analysis contributes to the understanding of how climate change alters biodiversity by reshaping community composition and highlights the importance of climate variables in biodiversity prediction.",

Does the emergence of brain regions that selectively process novel visual stimuli like words occur at the expense of cortical representations of other stimuli like faces and objects? To answer this question we conducted a randomized controlled trial with pre-school children (five years of age). We found that being taught reading versus oral language skills induced different patterns of change in category-selective regions of visual cortex. Reading instruction enhanced the response to text but did not diminish the response to other categories. How these changes play out over a longer timescale is still unknown but, based on these data, we can surmise that high-level visual cortex undergoes rapid changes as children enter school and begin establishing new skills like literacy.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSprinters exhibit inhomogeneous muscularity corresponding to musculoskeletal demand for sprinting execution. An inhomogeneous morphology would affect the mass distribution, which in turn may affect the mechanical difficulty in moving from an inertia perspective; however, the morphological characteristics of sprinters from the inertia perspective have not been examined. Here we show no corresponding differences in the normalized mass and normalized moment of inertia between the sprinters and untrained non-sprinters.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed fat- and water-separated magnetic resonance images from the lower limbs of 11 male sprinters (100 m best time of 10.44-10.83 s) and 12 untrained non-sprinters. We calculated the inertial properties by identifying the tissue of each voxel and combining the literature values for each tissue density.\n\nResultsThe lower-limb relative mass was significantly larger in sprinters (18.7 {+/-} 0.7% body mass) than in non-sprinters (17.6 {+/-} 0.6% body mass), while the normalized moment of inertia of the lower limb around the hip in the anatomical position was not significantly different (0.044 {+/-} 0.002 vs. 0.042 {+/-} 0.002 [a. u.]). The thigh relative mass in sprinters (12.9 {+/-} 0.4% body mass) was significantly larger than that in non-sprinters (11.9 {+/-} 0.4% body mass), whereas the shank and foot relative masses were not significantly different.\n\nConclusionWe revealed that the mechanical difficulty in swinging the lower limb is not relatively larger in sprinters in terms of inertia, even though the lower-limb mass is larger, reflecting their muscularity. We provide practical implications that sprinters can train without paying close attention to the increase in lower-limb mass and moment of inertia.",

However, it is not known why ion entry is necessary for T cell movement. Here we show that signaling from the chemokine receptor CCR7 leads to activation of WNK1 and its downstream pathway at the leading edge of migrating CD4+ T cells, resulting, we propose, in ion influx and consequent water entry by osmosis through AQP3. This WNK1-induced water entry is required to swell the membrane at the leading edge, generating space into which actin filaments can polymerize, thereby facilitating forward movement of the cell. Given the broad expression of WNK1 pathway proteins, our study shows that ion and water influx are likely to be essential for migration in many cell types, including leukocytes and metastatic tumor cells.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryChemokine-induced migration of T cells requires water entry at the leading edge to facilitate actin polymerization.",

It remains unclear how loss of brain pericytes in these conditions contributes to capillary dysfunction. Here, we conduct cause-and-effect studies by optically ablating pericytes in adult and aged mice in vivo. Focal pericyte loss induces capillary dilation without blood-brain barrier disruption. These abnormal dilations are exacerbated in the aged brain, and result in increased flow heterogeneity in capillary networks. A subset of affected capillaries experience reduced perfusion due to flow steal. Some capillaries stall in flow and regress, leading to loss of capillary connectivity. Remodeling of neighboring pericytes restores endothelial coverage and vascular tone within days. Pericyte remodeling is slower in the aged brain, resulting in regions of persistent capillary dilation. These findings link pericyte loss to disruption of capillary flow and structure. They also identify pericyte remodeling as a therapeutic target to preserve capillary flow dynamics.",

    "abstract": "This modeling study investigates whether an orderly convergence of neuronal selectivities from cortical areas V1 and V2 can produce curvature selective receptive fields found in area V4. A model of the ventral visual pathway from V1 to V4 is composed of approximately 500,000 individual integrate and fire units. The V1 and V2 models are based on recent findings about the composition of V2 receptive fields. A novel proposal is made for how V4 neurons may create selectivity for varying degrees of local curvature through the orderly convergence of afferent inputs from V2. The study employs a novel method for simulating individual spikes in large numbers of model neurons using tensor programming and GPU hardware: Assuming that convergent functional micro-architectural patterns repeat in topographically organized visual space, the details of individual unit depolarization and spike time is modeled using convolution operations combined with a model for the time course of post-synaptic potentials. The few parameters in the model are set manually, and this is sufficient to qualitatively reproduce the V4 recordings. This demonstrates that convolution technologies can be used for the realistic simulation of large numbers of neurons at an intermediate level of biological detail.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theory predicts a late-life decline in the force of natural selection, possibly leading to late-life deregulations of the immune system. A potential outcome of such immune-deregulation is the inability to produce specific immunity against target pathogens. We tested this possibility by infecting multiple Drosophila melanogaster lines (with bacterial pathogens) across age-groups, where either individual or different combinations of Imd- and Toll-inducible antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) were deleted using CRISPR gene editing. We show a high degree of non-redundancy and pathogen-specificity of AMPs in young flies: in some cases, even a single AMP could confer complete resistance. In contrast, ageing led to a complete loss of such specificity, warranting the action of multiple AMPs across Imd- and Toll-pathways during infections. Moreover, use of diverse AMPs either had no survival benefits, or even accompanied survival costs post-infection. These features were also sexually dimorphic: females expressed a larger repertoire of AMPs than males, but extracted equivalent survival benefits. Finally, age-specific expansion of the AMP-pool was associated with downregulation of negative-regulators of the Imd-pathway and a potential damage to renal function, as features of poorly-regulated immunity, Overall, we could establish ageing as an important driver of nonspecific AMP responses, across sexes and bacterial infections.",

Our results suggest that metabolisms using sulfide oxidation emerged in the Archean, but those involving thiosulfate emerged only after the Great Oxidation Event. Our data reveal that observed geochemical signatures resulted not from the expansion of a single type of organism, but were instead associated with genomic innovation across the biosphere. Moreover, our results provide the first indication of organic sulfur cycling from the mid-Proterozoic onwards, with implications for climate regulation and atmospheric biosignatures.

Recent cryo-EM structures of AAA+ molecular machines have uncovered nuanced changes in conformation that underlie their specialized functions. Furthermore, complexes between these machines and substrates begin to explain their mechanism of activity. Here we explore how crosslinking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) can be used to interpret changes in conformation induced by ATP and how substrates are associated. We applied a panel of crosslinking reagents to produce high-resolution crosslinking maps and interpret our data on previously determined X-ray and cryo-EM structures of Hsp104 from a thermophilic yeast, Calcarisporiella thermophila. We developed an analysis pipeline to differentiate between intra-subunit and inter-subunit contacts within the hexameric homo-oligomer. We identify crosslinks that break the asymmetry that are only present when ATP is bound and are absent in an ATP-binding deficient mutant. Finally, we identify contacts between Hsp104 and a model substrate to identify contacts on the central channel of Hsp104 across the length of the substrate indicating that we have trapped interactions consistent with translocation of the substrate. Our simple and robust XL-MS-based experiments and methods help interpret how these molecular machines change conformation and bind to substrates even in the context of homo-oligomeric assemblies.",

The mass of our planet setting a constant gravitational pull and its daily rotation on its axis setting a circadian rhythm are two examples of universal ecological parameters that shape the physiology of every living creature on earth. In the ocean, gravity plays a critical role in shaping the life history of phytoplankton with vast diversity of size and cell geometries all depending on light to survive while gravity is pulling them down. In order to survive, these organisms must evolve means to navigate a vertically stratified ocean. Here we present how cellular topology can enable sinking, rising, and levitation dynamics of seemingly non-motile cells in the open ocean. By studying the bio-luminescent dinoflagellate Pyrocystis noctiluca, we discover how rapid inflation dynamics regulates cell size and buoyancy in coordination to its cell cycle. Live-cell light-sheet imaging reveals a (n-genus) toroidal cytoplasm that enables this rapid inflation of overall cell volume over 5 fold in 15 minutes without dilution of cytoplasmic contents. Here we present combined field and lab measurements with system modeling to build a general framework for how non-motile plankton can escape the gravitational sedimentation trap, and how precise control of cell size becomes essential to survival.

Here we explored the interplay between chromatin accessibility and transcription across a detailed time-course of murine male meiosis by measuring genome-wide patterns of chromatin accessibility, nascent transcription, and processed mRNA. To understand the relationship between these parameters of gene regulation and recombination, we integrated these data with maps of double-strand break formation. Maps of nascent transcription show that Pol II is loaded on chromatin and maintained in a paused state early during prophase I. In later stages of prophase I, paused Pol II is released in a coordinated transcriptional burst resulting in [~]3-fold increase in transcription. Release from pause is mediated by the transcription factor A-MYB and the testis-specific bromodomain protein, BRDT. The burst of transcriptional activity is both temporally and spatially segregated from key steps of meiotic recombination: double strand breaks show evidence of chromatin accessibility earlier during prophase I and at distinct loci from those undergoing transcriptional activation, despite shared chromatin marks. Our findings reveal the mechanism underlying chromatin specialization in either transcription or recombination in meiotic cells.",

    "abstract": "3-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) is a biotin-dependent enzyme necessary for leucine catabolism in most organisms. While the crystal structure of recombinant bacterial MCC has been characterized, the structure and potential polymerization of native MCC remain elusive. Here, we discovered that native MCC from Leishmania tarentolae (LtMCC) forms filaments and determined its structure at near-atomic resolution using cryoEM. 6{beta}6 LtMCC dodecamers assemble in a twisted-stacks architecture, manifesting as supramolecular rods extending up to approximately 400 nanometers. LtMCCs in filaments bind biotin but are not covalently biotinylated and lack coenzyme A. Filaments elongate by stacking 6{beta}6 LtMCCs onto the exterior -trimer of the terminal 6{beta}6 dodecamer. This stacking immobilizes the biotin carboxylase domains, sequestering the enzyme in an inactive state within the mitochondrial matrix. Our results support a new model for LtMCC catalysis, termed the dual-swinging-domains model, and cast new light on the functional significance of polymerization in the carboxylase superfamily and beyond.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian Transcription Terminator Factor 1 (TTF1) is an essential protein which plays diverse cellular physiological functions like transcription regulation (both initiation and termination), replication fork blockage, chromatin remodelling, DNA damage repair etc. Hence, understanding the structure and mechanism conferred by its variable confirmations becomes significantly important. But so far, almost nothing is known about the structure of either the full-length protein or any of its domain in isolation. Moving towards achieving the above goals, our lab has codon optimised, expressed and purified N-terminal 190 amino acid deleted TTF1 ({Delta}N190TTF1) protein, since full length protein even after multiple trials could not be purified in soluble form. In this article, we have characterized this essential protein by studying its homogeneity, molecular size and secondary structure using tools like dynamic light scattering (DLS), circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy (AFM). By CD and DLS we have shown that the purified protein is homogenous and soluble. CD spectroscopy also revealed that {Delta}N190TTF1 is a helical protein which was further confirmed by analysis of Raman spectra and Amide I region deconvolution studies. AFM imaging data discovered the size of single protein molecule to be 94 nm which is in agreement with the size determined by the DLS study as well. Our structural and biophysical characterization of this essential protein will open avenues towards solving the structure to atomic resolution and also will encourage the research to investigate the mechanism behind its diverse functions attributed to its various domains.",

    "abstract": "The exit tunnel is the sub-compartment of the ribosome that contains the nascent polypeptide chain and as such, is involved in various vital functions, including regulation of translation and protein folding. As the geometry of the tunnel shows important differences across species, we focus on key geometrical features of eukaryote and prokaryote tunnels. We used a simple coarse-grained molecular dynamics model to study the role of the tunnel geometry in the post-translational escape of short proteins (sORFs), with lengths ranging from 6 to 56 amino acids. We found that the probability of escape for prokaryotes is one for all but the 12-mer chains. Moreover, proteins of this length have an extremely low escape probability in eukaryotes. A detailed examination of the associated single trajectories and energy profiles showed that these variations can be explained by the interplay between the protein configurational space and the confinement effects introduced by the constriction sites of the ribosome exit tunnel. For certain lengths, either one or both of the constriction sites can lead to the trapping of the protein in the \"pocket\" regions preceding these sites. As the distribution of existing sORFs indicate some bias in length that is consistent with our findings, we finally suggest that the constraints imposed by the tunnel geometry have impacted the evolution of sORFs.",

It is a large multi-domain mechano-sensitive protein stabilized by a net of disulfide bridges. Binding to platelet integrin is achieved by the vWF-C4 domain which exhibits a fixed fold, even under conditions of severe mechanical stress, but only if critical internal disulfide bonds are closed.\n\nObjectiveTo quantitatively determine C4s disulfide topologies and their implication in vWFs platelet-binding function via integrin.\n\nMethodsWe employed a combination of classical Molecular Dynamics and quantum mechanical simulations, mass spectrometry, site-directed mutagenesis, and platelet binding assays.\n\nResultsWe quantitatively show that two disulfide bonds in the vWF-C4 domain, namely the two major force-bearing ones, are partially reduced in human blood. Reduction leads to pronounced conformational changes within C4 that considerably affect the accessibility of the RGD-integrin binding motif, and thereby impair integrin-mediated platelet binding. Our combined approach also reveals that reduced species in the C4 domain undergo specific thiol/disulfide exchanges with the remaining disulfide bridges, in a process in which mechanical force may increase the proximity of specific reactant cysteines, further trapping C4 in a state of low integrin-binding propensity. We identify a multitude of redox states in all six vWF-C domains, suggesting disulfide bond reduction and swapping to be a general theme.\n\nConclusionOverall, our data put forward a mechanism in which disulfide bonds dynamically swap cysteine partners and control the interaction of vWF with integrin and potentially other partners, thereby critically influencing its hemostatic function.\n\nEssentialsO_LIPlatelet integrins interact with the disulfide-bonded C4 domain of von Willebrand Factor\nC_LIO_LIThe redox state of vWF-C4s disulfide bonds is studied by molecular simulations and experiments\nC_LIO_LITwo bonds are reduced causing C4 unfolding and disulfide swapping\nC_LIO_LIOpening of disulfide bonds impairs integrin-mediated platelet binding\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "For cell division to take place, proteins that carry it out need to accumulate to a functional threshold. Most of these divisome proteins are highly abundant in the cell, and accumulate smoothly and approximately exponentially throughout the cell cycle. In this threshold-crossing process, stochastic components arise from variation from one cycle to the next of accumulation rate and division fraction, and from fluctuations of the threshold itself. How these combine to determine the statistical properties of division times is still not well understood. Here we formulate this stochastic process and calculate the statistical properties of cell division times by using first passage time (FPT) techniques. We find that the distribution shape is determined by a ratio between two coefficient of variations (CVs), interpolating between Gaussian-like and long-tailed. Mean, variance and skewness of division times are predicted to follow well-defined relationships with model parameters. Publicly available single-cell data span a broad range of values in parameter space; the measured distribution shape and moment scaling agree well with the theory over the entire range. Because of balanced biosynthesis, the accumulation dynamics of any abundant protein - as well as cell size - predicts division time statistics equally well using our model. These results suggest that cell division is a multi-variable emergent process, which is nevertheless predictable by a single variable thanks to coupling and correlations inside the system.",

Here, we employed a connectomic approach using a high-resolution, serial-sectioning scanning electron microscopy volume to investigate the laminar cytoarchitecture of the transient external granular layer (EGL) of the developing cerebellum, where granule cells coordinate a series of mitotic and migratory events. By integrating image segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and deep learning approaches, we discovered and characterized anatomically complex intercellular connections bridging pairs of cerebellar granule cells throughout the EGL. Connected cells were either mitotic, migratory, or transitioning between these two cell stages, displaying a chronological continuum of proliferative and migratory events never previously observed in vivo at this resolution. This unprecedented ultra-structural characterization poses intriguing hypotheses about intercellular connectivity between developing progenitors, and its possible role in the development of the central nervous system (CNS).",

    "abstract": "Strictly ultrametric matrices appear in many domains of mathematics and science; nevertheless, they can be large and dense, making them difficult to store and manipulate, unlike large but sparse matrices. In this manuscript, we exploit that strictly ultrametric matrices can be represented as binary trees to sparsify them via an orthonormal base change based on Haar-like wavelets. We show that, with overwhelmingly high probability, only an asymptotically negligible fraction of the off-diagonal entries in random but large strictly ultrametric matrices remain non-zero after the base change; and develop an algorithm to sparsify such matrices directly from their tree representation. We also identify the subclass of matrices diagonalized by the Haar-like wavelets and supply a sufficient condition to approximate the spectrum of strictly ultrametric matrices outside this subclass. Our methods give computational access to the covariance matrix of the microbiologists Tree of Life, which was previously inaccessible due to its size, and motivate introducing a new wavelet-based (beta-diversity) metric to compare microbial environments. Unlike the established (beta-diversity) metrics, the new metric may be used to identify internal nodes (i.e., splits) in the Tree that link microbial composition and environmental factors in a statistically significant manner.\n\nMSC codes05C05, 15A18, 42C40, 65F55, 92C70",

Sanguinarine and Shikonin showed significant cytotoxicity, whereas Fisetin, Honokiol, Tanshinone IIA and -Mangostin were well-tolerated in all the cell lines tested. Honokiol and -Mangostin treatment protected Vero-E6 cells against MAYV-induced damage and resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in viral progeny yields for each of the MAYV strains and human cell lines assessed. Also, Honokiol and -Mangostin disrupted MAYV infection at different stages of the virus life cycle. Moreover, these compounds decreased Una, Chikungunya and Zika viral titers and downmodulated the expression of E1 and nsP1 viral proteins from MAYV, Una and Chikungunya. Finally, in Honokiol- and -Mangostin-treated cells, we observed an upregulation in the expression of type I interferon and specific interferon-stimulated genes, including IFN, IFN{beta}, MxA, ISG15, OAS2, MDA-5, TNF and IL-1{beta}, which may promote an antiviral cellular state.

However, how tetraploid cells differ from normal diploids in their sensitivity to anti-proliferative treatments remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that tetraploid cells are significantly more susceptible to inhibitors of a mitotic kinesin CENP-E than diploids. CENP-E inhibitor preferentially diminished the tetraploid cell population in diploid-tetraploid co-culture at optimum conditions. Live imaging revealed that tetraploidy-linked increase in unsolvable polar chromosome misalignment caused substantially longer mitotic delay in tetraploids than in diploids upon moderate CENP-E inhibition. This time gap of mitotic arrest resulted in cohesion fatigue and subsequent cell death, specifically in tetraploids, leading to tetraploidy-selective cell growth suppression. In contrast, the microtubule-stabilizing compound paclitaxel caused tetraploidy-selective growth suppression through the aggravation of spindle multipolarization. We also found that CENP-E inhibitor had superior generality to paclitaxel in its tetraploidy selectivity across a broader spectrum of cell lines. Our results highlight the unique properties of CENP-E inhibitors in tetraploidy-selective suppression, giving us clues on the further development of tetraploidy-targeting interventions in cancer.",

We determined that superprocessivity of KIF1A dimers originates from a unique structural domain, the lysine rich insertion in loop-12 termed the  K-Loop, which enhances electrostatic interactions between the motor and the microtubule. In 80 mM PIPES buffer, replacing the native loop-12 of KIF1A with that of kinesin-1, resulted in a 6-fold decrease in run length, and adding additional positive charge to loop-12 enhanced the run length. Interestingly, swapping the KIF1A loop-12 into kinesin-1 did not enhance its run length, consistent with the two motor families using different mechanochemical tuning to achieve persistent transport. To investigate the mechanism by which the KIF1A K-loop enhances processivity, we used microtubule pelleting and single-molecule dwell times assays in ATP and ADP. First, the microtubule affinity was similar in ATP and in ADP, consistent with the motor spending the majority of its cycle in a weakly-bound state. Second, the microtubule affinity and single-molecule dwell time in ADP were 6-fold lower in the loop-swap mutant compared to wild type. Thus, the positive charge in loop-12 of KIF1A enhances the run length by stabilizing the motor binding in its vulnerable one-head-bound state. Finally, through a series of mutants with varying positive charge in the K-loop, we found that the KIF1A processivity is linearly dependent on the charge of loop-12.",

    "abstract": "Ecological relationships between bacteria mediate the services that gut microbiomes provide to their hosts. Knowing the overall direction and strength of these relationships within hosts, and their generalizability across hosts, is essential to learn how microbial ecology scales up to affect microbiome assembly, dynamics, and host health. Here we gain insight into these patterns by inferring thousands of correlations in bacterial abundance between pairs of gut microbiome taxa from extensive time series data (5,534 microbiome profiles from 56 wild baboon hosts over a 13-year period). We model these time series using a statistically robust, multinomial logistic-normal modeling framework and test the degree to which bacterial abundance correlations are consistent across hosts (i.e., \"universal\") or individualized to each host. We also compare these patterns to two publicly available human data sets. We find that baboon gut microbial relationships are largely universal: correlation patterns within each baboon host reflect a mixture of idiosyncratic and shared patterns, but the shared pattern dominates by almost 2-fold. Surprisingly, the strongest and most consistently correlated bacterial pairs across hosts were overwhelmingly positively correlated and typically belonged to the same family--a 3-fold enrichment compared to pairs drawn from the data set as a whole. The bias towards universal, positive bacterial correlations was also apparent in monthly samples from human infants, and bacterial families that had universal relationships in baboons also tended to be universal in human infants. Together, our results advance our understanding of the relationships that shape gut microbial ecosystems, with implications for microbiome personalization, community assembly and stability, and the feasibility of microbiome interventions to improve host health.",

    "abstract": "Summer drought represents one of the main stress sources stress for plant communities in the Mediterranean region. Plants can adopt several response strategies to cope with stress, reflected in the adoption of specific Plant Functional Traits (PFTs). Trait-based approaches commonly meet three critical issues: they overlook Intraspecific Variability (ITV), they focus on a large spatial scale, or they focus on single trait responses to stress. In this study, we present evidence for a significant amount of ITV in morphological and anatomical trait syndromes observed between three local populations of Phyllirea latifolia, Pistacia lentiscus and Quercus ilex, distributed along an aridity gradient. Thicker, more physiologically expensive leaves and lower heights found in the drier sites mainly conform to drought-resistance strategies. Interestingly, PFTs from Cistus salviifolius were found not to vary between sites. This implies that not all species vary at the same geographical scale, possibly depending on their different successional role. The main implication behind our findings is that climate can easily drive significant ITV in multiple traits among plant populations, even at a local scale, although trait responsiveness might be species-specific. Different plant populations hailing from the same geographical regions might thus respond differently to climate change.\n\nHIGHLIGHTVariations in Plant Functional Traits from several Mediterranean species found along an aridity gradient on a local (<60Km radius) scale; responses consistent to reported drought adaptations.",

    "abstract": "The recent analyses in animals show that gene gain and loss fluctuate during evolutionary time. However, these studies lack the full profile of macroevolutionary trajectories as they do not consider other eukaryotic lineages and deeper evolutionary periods that go back to the origin of cellular organisms. To give a more inclusive view on the macroevolutionary patterns of genome complexity across the tree of life, we here recovered the evolutionary dynamics of gene family gain and loss ranging from the ancestor of cellular organisms to four focal species that represent animal, plant, and fungal diversity. We show that in all considered lineages the gene family content follows a common evolutionary pattern, where the number of gene families reaches the highest value at a major evolutionary and ecological transition, and then gradually decreases towards extant organisms. This pattern suggests that the genome complexity, approximated by the number of residing gene families, does not continuously increase through evolutionary time. We conclude that simplification by gene family loss is a dominant force in Phanerozoic genomes of various lineages, probably underpinned by intense ecological specializations and functional outsourcing. These findings support current theoretical predictions on the macroevolutionary change in genome complexity.",

Here, we present Roulette, a genome-wide mutation rate model at the basepair resolution that incorporates known determinants of local mutation rate (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/downloads/Vova/Roulette/). Roulette is shown to be more accurate than existing models1,6. Roulette has sufficient resolution at high mutation rate sites to model allele frequencies under recurrent mutation. We use Roulette to refine estimates of population growth within Europe by incorporating the full range of human mutation rates. The analysis of significant deviations from the model predictions revealed a 10-fold increase in mutation rate in nearly all genes transcribed by Polymerase III, suggesting a new mutagenic mechanism.

    "abstract": "Pathological obesity and its complications are associated with an increased propensity for bone fractures. Humans with certain genetic polymorphisms at the kinase suppressor of ras2 (Ksr2) locus develop severe early-onset obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Both conditions are phenocopied in mice with Ksr2 deleted, but whether this affects bone health remains unknown. Here we studied the bones of global Ksr2 null mice and found that Ksr2 negatively regulates femoral, but not vertebral, bone mass in two genetic backgrounds, while the paralogous gene, Ksr1, was dispensable for bone homeostasis. Mechanistically, KSR2 regulates bone formation by influencing adipocyte differentiation at the expense of osteoblasts in the bone marrow. Compared with Ksr2s known role as a regulator of feeding by its function in the hypothalamus, pair feeding and osteoblast-specific conditional deletion of Ksr2 reveals that Ksr2 can regulate bone formation autonomously. Despite the gains in appendicular bone mass observed in absence of Ksr2, bone strength, as well as fracture healing response remains compromised in these mice. This study highlights the interrelationship between adiposity and bone health and provides mechanistic insights into how Ksr2, an adiposity and diabetic gene, regulates bone metabolism.",

    "abstract": "In mouse and human, genes subjected to genomic imprinting have been shown to function in development, behaviour, and post-natal adaptations. Failure to correctly imprint genes in human is associated with developmental syndromes, adaptive and metabolic disorders during life as well as numerous forms of cancer. In recent years researchers have turned to RNA-seq technologies applied to reciprocal hybrid strains of mice to identify novel imprinted genes, causing a 3-fold increase in genes reported as having a parental origin specific expression bias. The functional relevance of parental origin-specific expression bias is not fully appreciated especially since many are reported with only minimal parental bias (e.g. 51:49). Here we present an in-depth meta-analysis of previously generated RNA-seq data and show that the methods used to generate and analyse libraries greatly influence the calling of allele-specific expression. Validation experiments show that most novel genes called with parental-origin specific allelic bias are artefactual, with the mouse strain contributing a larger effect on expression biases than parental origin. Of the weak novel genes that do validate, most are located at the periphery of known imprinted domains, suggesting they may be affected by local allele- and tissue-specific conformation. Together these findings highlight the need for robust tools, definitions, and validation of putative imprinted genes to provide meaningful information within imprinting databases and to understand the functional and mechanistic implications of the process.",

These rates varied substantially, yet transcripts from genes with related functions or targeted by the same transcription factors and RNA binding proteins flowed across subcellular compartments with similar kinetics. Verifying these associations uncovered roles for DDX3X and PABPC4 in nuclear export. For hundreds of genes, most transcripts were degraded within the nucleus, while the remaining molecules were exported and persisted with stable lifespans. Transcripts residing on chromatin for longer had extended poly(A) tails, whereas the reverse was observed for cytoplasmic mRNAs.

    "abstract": "Protein nanostructures produced through the self-assembly of individual subunits are attractive scaffolds to attach and position functional molecules for applications in biomaterials, metabolic engineering, tissue engineering, and a plethora of nanomaterials. However, the assembly of multicomponent protein nanomaterials is generally a laborious process that requires each protein component to be separately expressed and purified prior to assembly. Moreover, excess components not incorporated into the final assembly must be removed from the solution and thereby necessitate additional processing steps. Here, we developed an efficient approach to purify functionalized protein filament assemblies directly from bacterial lysates in a single step through a type of multimodal chromatography that combines size-exclusion, hydrophilic interaction, and ion exchange to separate recombinant protein assemblies from excess free subunits and bacterial proteins. In this approach, the ultrastable filamentous protein gamma-prefoldin was employed as a material scaffold that can be functionalized with a variety of protein domains through SpyTag/SpyCatcher conjugation chemistry. The purification of recombinant gamma-prefoldin filaments from bacterial lysates using multimodal chromatography was optimized across a wide range of salt concentrations and pH. Subsequently, functionalized protein assemblies were purified from bacterial lysates using multimodal chromatography in a single step and shown to befree of unincorporated subunits. The assembly and purification of protein nanostructures with varying amounts of functionalization was confirmed using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Forster resonance energy transfer, and transmission electron microscopy. We envision that the use of multimodal chromatography will increase the throughput of protein nanostructure prototyping as well as enable the upscaling of the bioproduction of protein nanodevices.",

Although various scoring functions have been proposed, it remains challenging to accurately evaluate the binding affinity of a protein-ligand complex with known bound structure due to the potential preference of scoring system. In recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to scoring functions without sophisticated feature engineering. Nevertheless, existing methods cannot model the differential contribution of atoms in various regions of proteins, and the relationship between atom properties and intermolecular distance is also not fully explored.\n\nResultsWe propose a novel empirical graph neural network for accurate protein-ligand binding affinity prediction (EGNA). Graphs of protein, ligand and their interactions are constructed based on different regions of each bound complex. Proteins and ligands are effectively represented by graph convolutional layers, enabling the EGNA to capture interaction patterns precisely by simulating empirical scoring functions. The contributions of different factors on binding affinity can thus be transparently investigated. EGNA is compared with the state-of-the-art machine learning-based scoring functions on two widely used benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of EGNA and its good generalization capability.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe web server and source code of EGNA is available at www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/EGNA and https://github.com/chunqiux/EGNA.\n\nContacthbshen@sjtu.edu.cn or 2008xypan@sjtu.edu.cn\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Using this model, I determine the prerequisites for using FRET to investigate modulator-regulator interaction.

    "abstract": "Castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is an advanced form of prostate cancer associated with loss of androgen receptor activity and resistance to AR-targeted therapies. CRPC is often associated with higher metastasis, invasion, and proliferation. Thus, theres a strong need for additional molecular markers in CRPC, and therapies that target them directly. Transcriptomic profiling of prostate cancer patients revealed an upregulated signature specific to high-grade tumors in cell cycle progression, E2F targets, G2M checkpoint, DNA repair, Aurora Kinase B, and FOXM1 pathway. Validation in a separate cohort of neuroendocrine prostate cancer patients, the most resistant and invasive form of CRPC which lacks AR expression, showed CCP signature as a dominant driver gene set for NEPC. Moreover, high expression of mRNA targets in each of these pathways is associated with poor overall survival in NEPC patients. Gene set variation analysis revealed a strong inverse correlation between AR signaling and CCP.31, set of 31 markers associated with high proliferation, and a positive correlation between CCP.31 and NEPC signature. FOXM1, a prioritized candidate in CCP is shown to be upregulated in CRPC cell lines and human clinical sections of Gleason 9 patients. GSNO, a nitric oxide donor, known for its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation and an effective inhibitor of cell cycle checkpoints, was able to reverse CCP signature both in-vitro and in-vivo. GSNO exhibits a dependence on AR signaling in-vitro by showing mild effect on CRPC clones, but successfully inhibits tumor growth of AR-null CRPC xenografts. FOXM1 is also targeted by GSNO in-vivo and in-vitro models of both CRPC and AD prostate cancer. This establishes an important link between androgen receptor status in prostate cancer and proposes nitric oxide donors as therapeutic intervention. GSNO is effective against AR-null castration resistant prostate cancer.\n\nSignificanceNitric oxide donor, S-glutathione-transferase inhibits tumor growth of castration resistant prostate cancer, regardless of androgen receptor expression status by targeting FOXM1, a critical regulator of cell cycle progression.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "While one third of the risk for Alzheimers disease (AD) is explained by environment and lifestyle, AD pathology also affects individual lifestyle, possibly long before clinical manifestation of dementia. To study this hidden disease effect with its potentially large impact on coping with AD, we examined in mice how the AppNL-F/NL-F (NL-F) knock-in mutation affects the pre-symptomatic response to environmental enrichment (ENR). We assessed the emergence of inter-individual phenotypic variation while both genetic background and the shared environment were held constant, thereby isolating the contribution of individual behavior ( non-shared environment). After 4 months of ENR, in NL-F both mean and variability of plasma ApoE were increased, suggesting a pre-symptomatic variation in pathogenic processes. Roaming entropy (RE) as a measure of behavioral activity was continuously assessed with radiofrequency identification (RFID) technology and revealed reduced habituation and variance in NL-F compared to controls. Intra-individual variation decreased but behavioral predictability and stability were reduced in NL-F. Seven months after discontinuation of ENR we found no difference in plaque size and number, but ENR increased variance in hippocampal plaque counts in NL-F. A reactive increase in adult hippocampal neurogenesis in NL-F, known from other models, was normalized by ENR. Our data suggest that, while NL-F has early effects on individual behavioral patterns in response to ENR, there are lasting effects at the level of cellular plasticity even after discontinuation of ENR. Hence, early behavior matters for maintaining individual behavioral trajectories and brain plasticity even under maximally constraint conditions.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis relates to the brain resilience and is reduced in Alzheimers disease (AD). Restoring healthy levels of neurogenesis could have beneficial effects for coping with neurodegeneration. However, molecular mechanisms that could enhance neurogenesis from astroglial progenitors in AD pathology are largely unknown. We used lentiviruses to express Ngfr in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD, histologically analyzed the changes in proliferation of neural stem cells and neurogenesis; performed single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies. We found that expression of Ngfr, a neurogenic determinant in pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcome in the APP/PS1dE9 AD mouse model. Ngfr suppressed reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) in astroglia. Blockage of Lcn2 receptor, Slc22a17, recapitulated the neurogenic effects of NGFR, and long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, immunostaining on postmortem human hippocampi with AD or primary age-related Tauopathy and 3D human astroglial cultures showed that elevated LCN2 levels correlate with gliosis. By comparing transcriptional changes in mouse hippocampus, zebrafish brain, and human AD brains in terms of cell intrinsic differential gene expression analyses as well as weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we observed common potential downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, C4B and PFKP, that are relevant to AD. Our study links the regulatory role of an autocrine molecular mechanism in astroglia to the neurogenic ability and modulatory effects on amyloid and tau phosphorylation, opening new research avenues and suggesting that neurogenesis-oriented therapeutic approaches could be a potential clinical intervention for AD.",

    "abstract": "RATIONALEMatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) of tissues became popular in the last decade. Consequently, adapting sample preparation methods for different materials turned to be a pivotal step for a successful analysis, due to the requirement of samples slices of 12-20 m thickness. However, preparing thin sections compatible with MALDI-IMS for unusual samples is challenging, as existing histological protocols may not be suitable, thus requiring new methods. Acai (Euterpe oleracea Mart.) seed is an example of a challenging material due to its toughness and resistance to crack. Therefore, our goal was to develop a methodology to obtain thin (<20 m) and entire longitudinal sections of acai seeds for MALDI-IMS analysis.\n\nMETHODSDifferent strategies were evaluated for obtaining thin cuts of seeds, being the combination of the following steps the most suitable option: (i) softening of seeds by water immersion for 24 h; (ii) longitudinal cut of seeds to obtain half-seeds using a razor blade and a hammer; (iii) half-seeds imbibition in gelatin; (iv) sectioning using a cryostat at -20 {degrees}C to obtain samples with <20 m thickness; and (v) collection of samples in an indium tin oxide coated glass slide covered by a double-face copper tape to avoid sample wrapping and ensure adhesion after unfreezing. (iv) storage of samples in a -80 {degrees}C freezer, if necessary.\n\nRESULTSAs a result, this adapted sample preparation method enabled the analysis of acai seeds by MALDI-IMS providing spatial distribution of carbohydrates in the endosperm.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe adaptations developed for sample preparation will help investigate the metabolic and physiological properties of acai seeds in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic cilia and flagella are microtubule-based organelles whose relatively simple shape makes them ideal for investigating the fundamental question of organelle size regulation. Most of the flagellar materials are transported from the cell body via an active transport process called intraflagellar transport (IFT). The rate of IFT entry into flagella, known as IFT injection, has been shown to negatively correlate with flagellar length. However, it remains unknown how the cell measures the length of its flagella and controls IFT injection. One of the most-discussed theoretical models for length sensing to control IFT is the ion-current model, which posits that there is a uniform distribution of Ca2+ channels along the flagellum and that the Ca2+ current from the flagellum into the cell body increases linearly with flagellar length. In this model, the cell uses the Ca2+ current to negatively regulate IFT injection. The recent discovery that IFT entry into flagella is regulated by the phosphorylation of kinesin through a calcium-dependent protein kinase has provided further impetus for the ion-current model. To test this model, we measured and manipulated the levels of Ca2+ inside of Chlamydomonas flagella and quantified IFT injection. Although the concentration of Ca2+ inside of flagella was weakly correlated with the length of flagella, we found that IFT injection was reduced in calcium-deficient flagella, rather than increased as the model predicted, and that variation in IFT injection was uncorrelated with the occurrence of flagellar Ca2+ spikes. Thus, Ca2+ does not appear to function as a negative regulator of IFT injection, hence it cannot form the basis of a stable length control system.",

    "abstract": "Efficient regeneration requires multiple cell types acting in a coordination. To better understand the intercellular networks involved and how they change when regeneration fails, we profiled the transcriptome of hematopoietic, stromal, myogenic, and endothelial cells over 14 days following acute muscle damage. A time-resolved computational model of interactions was generated, and VEGFA-driven endothelial engagement was identified as a key differentiating feature in models of successful and failed regeneration. In addition, it revealed that the majority of secreted signals, including VEGFA, are simultaneously produced by multiple cell types. To test whether the cellular source of a factor determines its function, we deleted VEGFA from two cell types residing in close proximity, stromal and myogenic progenitors. By comparing responses to different types of damage, we found that myogenic and stromal VEGFA have distinct functions in regeneration. This suggests that spatial compartmentalization of signaling plays a key role in intercellular communication networks.\n\nHighlightsO_LILigand-receptor signaling redundancy during skeletal muscle regeneration\nC_LIO_LIInflammatory cells, and muscle and fibro/adipogenic progenitors produce VEGFA\nC_LIO_LIVEGFA from muscle progenitors control their proliferation after muscle damage\nC_LIO_LIVEGFA from FAP controls angiogenesis only after ischemic damage\nC_LI\n\neTOC blurbGroppa et al. performed a novel time-resolved bioinformatics analysis that revealed extensive ligand-receptor redundancy among the cell types contributing to skeletal muscle regeneration.
