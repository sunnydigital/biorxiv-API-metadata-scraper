    "abstract": "Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is an osmolyte that accumulates in cells in response to osmotic stress. TMAO stabilizes proteins by the entropic stabilization mechanism, which pictures TMAO as a nano-crowder that predominantly destabilizes the unfolded state. However, the mechanism of action of TMAO on RNA is much less understood. Here, we use all atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how TMAO interacts with a 12-nt RNA hairpin with a high melting temperature, and an 8-nt RNA hairpin, which has a relatively fluid native basin in the absence of TMAO. The use of the two hairpins with different free energy of stabilization allows us to probe the origin of the destabilization effect of TMAO on RNA molecules without the possibility of forming tertiary interactions. We generated multiple trajectories using allatom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit water by employing AMBER and CHARMM force fields, both in the absence and presence of TMAO. We observed qualitatively similar RNA-TMAO interaction profiles from the simulations using the two force fields. TMAO hydrogen bond interactions are largely depleted around the paired RNA bases and ribose sugars. In contrast, we show that the oxygen atom in TMAO, the hydrogen bond acceptor, preferentially interacts with the hydrogen bond donors in the solvent exposed bases, such as those in the stem-loop, the destabilized base stacks in the unfolded state, especially in the marginally stable 8-nt RNA hairpin. The predicted destabilization mechanism through TMAO-RNA hydrogen bond interactions could be tested using two-dimensional IR spectroscopy. Since TMAO does not significantly interact with the hydroxyl group of the ribose sugars, we predict that similar results must also hold for DNA.",

    "abstract": "Membrane potential in bacterial systems has been shown to be dynamic and tightly related to survivability at the single cell level. However, little is known about spatio-temporal patterns of membrane potential in bacterial colonies and biofilms. Here, we discovered a switch from uncorrelated to collective dynamics within colonies formed by the human pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In freshly assembled colonies, polarization is heterogeneous with instances of transient and uncorrelated hyper- or depolarization of individual cells. As colonies reach a critical size, the polarization behaviour switches to collective dynamics: A hyperpolarized shell forms at the centre, travels radially outward, and halts several micrometres from the colony periphery. Once the shell has passed, we detect an influx of potassium correlated with depolarisation. Transient hyperpolarization also demarks the transition from volume to surface growth. By combining simulations and the use of an alternative electron acceptor for the respiratory chain, we provide strong evidence that local oxygen gradients shape the collective polarization dynamics. Finally, we show that within the hyperpolarized shell, tolerance against aminoglycoside antibiotics but not against {beta}-lactam antibiotics is increased, suggesting that depolarization instantaneously protects cells, while the protective effect of growth arrest does not set in immediately. These findings highlight that the polarization pattern can demark the differentiation into distinct subpopulations with different growth rates and antibiotic tolerance.\n\nSignificance statementAt the level of single bacteria, membrane potential is surprisingly dynamic and transient hyperpolarization has been associated with increased death rate. Yet, little is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of membrane polarization during biofilm development. Here, we reveal a discrete transition from uncorrelated to collective polarization dynamics within spherical colonies. Suddenly, a shell of hyperpolarized cells forms at the colony centre and hyperpolarization travels radially outward. In the wake of this shell, bacteria depolarize, reduce their growth rate, and become tolerant against antibiotics, indicating the onset of habitat diversity. Single cell live imaging and modelling link hyperpolarization to an oxygen gradient formed within the colonies. We anticipate that dynamical polarization patterns are tightly connected to biofilm differentiation in various bacterial species.",

    "abstract": "Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2) and androgen receptor (AR) are crucial chromatin regulators involved in the development and/or progression of prostate tumor, including advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). To sustain prostate tumorigenicity, EZH2 establishes noncanonical biochemical interaction with AR for mediating oncogene activation, in addition to its canonical role as a transcriptional repressor and enzymatic subunit of Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). However, the molecular basis underlying non-canonical activities of EZH2 in prostate cancer remains elusive and therapeutic strategies for targeting EZH2:AR-mediated oncogene activation activities are also lacking. Here, we report that a cryptic transactivation domain of EZH2 (EZH2TAD) binds both AR and AR spliced variant 7 (AR-V7, an AR variant enriched in CRPC), mediating assembly and/or recruitment of transactivation-related machineries at genomic sites that lack PRC2 binding. Such noncanonical targets of EZH2:AR/AR-V7:(co)activators are enriched for the clinically-relevant oncogenes. We also show that EZH2TAD is required for the chromatin recruitment of EZH2, for EZH2-mediated oncogene activation, and for CRPC growth in vitro and in vivo. To completely block EZH2s multifaceted oncogenic activities in prostate cancer, we employed MS177, a recently developed proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC) of EZH2. Strikingly, MS177 achieved on-target depletion of both EZH2s canonical (EZH2:PRC2) and noncanonical (EZH2TAD:AR/AR-V7:coactivators) complexes in prostate tumor, eliciting much more potent antitumor effects than the catalytic inhibitors of EZH2. Overall, this study reports previously unappreciated requirements of EZH2TAD for mediating EZH2s noncanonical (co)activator recruitment and gene-activation functions in prostate tumor and suggests EZH2-targeting PROTACs as potentially attractive therapeutics for the treatment of aggressive prostate tumors that rely on the circuits wired by EZH2 and AR.",

    "abstract": "Diffuse midline gliomas arise in the brainstem and other midline brain structures and cause a large proportion of childhood brain tumor deaths. Radiation therapy is the most effective treatment option, but these tumors ultimately progress. Inhibition of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-like kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), which orchestrates the cellular response to radiation-induced DNA damage, may enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy. Diffuse midline gliomas in the brainstem contain loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressor PTEN, or functionally similar alterations in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway, at moderate frequency. Here, we sought to determine if Atm inactivation could radiosensitize a primary mouse model of brainstem glioma driven by Pten loss. Using Cre/loxP recombinase technology and the RCAS/TVA retroviral gene delivery system, we established a mouse model of brainstem glioma driven by Pten deletion. We find that Pten-null brainstem gliomas are relatively radiosensitive at baseline. In addition, we show that deletion of Atm in the tumor cells does not extend survival of mice bearing Pten-null brainstem gliomas after focal brain irradiation. These results characterize a novel primary mouse model of PTEN-mutated brainstem glioma and provide insights into the mechanism of radiosensitization by Atm deletion, which may guide the design of future clinical trials.\n\nBrief SummaryWe develop a mouse model of PTEN-mutated brainstem glioma and find that perturbation of the ATM does not enhance radiation efficacy in this model.",

    "abstract": "We have examined the mechanism through which fibrotic extracellular matrices promote tumor progression and metastasis in HER2+ breast cancer. We found that integrin-mediated mechano-transduction and engagement of ERBB2/ERBB3 cooperate to induce activation of YAP and invasive growth in stiff 3D Matrigel-Collagen I. Mechanistic studies revealed that joint activation of SRC Family Kinases (SFKs) by FAK and ERBB2/3 results in tyrosine phosphorylation and inactivation of LATS1/2 and MOB1. The ensuing activation of YAP enables HER2+ breast cancer cells to proliferate and invade in 3D Matrigel-Collagen I. In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of LATS1/2 and MOB1 and activation of YAP are required for v-SRC-mediated transformation of fibroblasts. Finally, preclinical studies indicated that FAK-SRC signaling is required for primary tumor growth and lung metastasis in the MMTV-Neu mouse model of HER2+ breast cancer. Congruently, administration of dasatinib significantly increased the capacity of lapatinib to inhibit primary tumor growth and lung colonization in MMTV-Neu mice. These findings indicate that integrin-mediated mechano-transduction functions as a rheostat to regulate ERBB2 signaling to YAP and suggest that co-targeting ERBB2 and SFKs may exhibit therapeutic efficacy in HER2+ breast cancer.\n\nSignificance statementStromal stiffness, which ensues from increased deposition and crosslinking of linear collagens, promotes oncogenesis and tumor progression in the breast. Moreover, tumor fibrosis is increased in the more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, such as Triple Negative (TN) and HER2+ breast cancer. However, the mechanisms through which extracellular matrix stiffness regulates intracellular signaling are poorly understood. In this study, we show that the Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK)-SRC Family Kinase (SFK) complex integrates the sensing of matrix rigidity by integrins and the activation of ERBB2/3 to promote activation of YAP and that YAP is required for breast cancer growth and invasion. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that SFKs can phosphorylate and inhibit LATS1 and MOB1, leading to activation of YAP. Simultaneous inhibition of ERBB2/3 with lapatinib and SFKs with dasatinib profoundly inhibits primary tumor growth and metastasis in a mouse model of HER2+ breast cancer. These findings suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of combinatorial blockade of ERBB2 and integrin-mediated mechano-transduction should be tested in biomarker-driven clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "c-Myc protooncogene places a demand on glucose uptake to drive glucose-dependent biosynthetic pathways. To achieve this demand, c-Myc protein (Myc henceforth) drives the expression of glucose transporters and represses the expression of Thioredoxin Interacting Protein (TXNIP), which is a potent negative regulator of glucose uptake. A Mychigh/TXNIPlow gene signature is clinically significant as it correlates with poor clinical prognosis in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) but not in other subtypes of breast cancer. To better understand how TXNIP function contributes to the aggressive behavior of TNBC, we generated TXNIP null MDA-MB-231 (231:TKO) cells for our study. We show here that TXNIP loss drives a transcriptional program that resembles those driven by Myc and increases global Myc genome occupancy. TXNIP loss allows Myc to invade the promoters and enhancers of target genes that are potentially relevant to cell transformation. Together, these findings suggest that TXNIP is a broad repressor of Myc genomic binding. The increase in Myc genomic binding in the 231:TKO cells expands the Myc-dependent transcriptome we identified in parental MDA-MB-231 cells. This expansion of Myc-dependent transcription following TXNIP loss occurs without an apparent increase in Mycs intrinsic capacity to activate transcription and without increasing Myc levels. Together, our findings suggest that TXNIP loss mimics Myc overexpression, connecting Myc genomic binding and transcriptional programs to the metabolic signals that control TXNIP expression.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in the metabolic enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1/2) have been found in a number of liquid and solid tumors. Their pathogenic mechanism of action involves production of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), an oncometabolite that acts in part by inhibiting members of a family of dioxygenases that modulate chromatin dynamics. Recent work has suggested that mutant IDH (mIDH) and 2HG also impact sensitivity to inhibitors of poly-ADP ribose polymerases (PARP) but the molecular basis for this sensitivity is unclear. Unlike PARP inhibitor-sensitive BRCA1/2 tumors which exhibit impaired homologous recombination, IDH-mutant tumors have a silent mutational profile and lack mutational signatures associated with impaired homologous recombination. Instead, 2HG-producing IDH mutations lead to heterochromatin-dependent slowing of DNA replication and increased replication stress, resulting in DNA double strand breaks. This replicative stress manifests as replication fork slowing but the breaks are repaired without a significant increase in the cellular mutation burden. Faithful resolution of replicative stress in IDH-mutant cells is dependent on poly-ADP ribosylation. Treatment with PARP inhibitors restores replication fork speed but results in incomplete repair of DNA breaks. These findings provide evidence of a requirement for PARP in the replication of heterochromatin and further validate PARP as a potential therapeutic target in IDH-mutant tumors.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsNonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the etiologies that contribute to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and chronic inflammation is one of the proposed mediators of HCC. As necroptosis is a cell death pathway that induces inflammation, we tested whether necroptosis- induced inflammation contributes to the progression of NAFLD to HCC in a mouse model of diet- induced HCC.\n\nMethodsMale and female wild-type (WT) mice or mouse models where necroptosis is blocked (Ripk3-/- or Mlkl-/- mice) were fed a control diet or choline-deficient low fat diet (CD-LFD) or CD-high fat diet (CD-HFD) for 6 months. Changes in inflammation, immune cell infiltration, activation of oncogenic pathways, and tumor incidence were assessed by gene expression analysis, western blotting, and flow cytometry. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to assess the changes in liver transcriptome.\n\nResultsBlocking necroptosis by deleting either Ripk3 or Mlkl reduced markers of inflammation [proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-6, and IL-1{beta}), F4/80+ve macrophages, CCR2+ve infiltrating monocytes], inflammation associated oncogenic pathways (JNK, PD-L1/PD-1, {beta}-catenin), and HCC in male mice. In female mice, blocking necroptosis reduced HCC independent of inflammation. Blocking necroptosis reduced cell senescence markers in males and females, suggesting a novel cross-talk between necroptosis and cell senescence.\n\nConclusionsOur data show that hepatic necroptosis promotes recruitment and activation of liver macrophages leading to chronic inflammation, which in turn trigger oncogenic pathways leading to the progression of NAFLD to HCC in male mice. In female mice necroptosis contributes to HCC independent of inflammation. Thus, our study suggests that necroptosis is a valid target for NAFLD-mediated HCC.\n\nSynopsisNecroptosis is a cell death pathway that mediate inflammation. Blocking necroptosis attenuated chronic inflammation by reducing recruitment and activation of liver macrophages, which in turn reduced activation of oncogenic pathways and progression of NAFLD to HCC in mice.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=142 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/502666v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bf82d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26fc68org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18538f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e338b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We have here investigated mechanisms underlying venogenesis, particularly the molecular control over venous fate acquisition during vascular development.\n\nApproach and ResultsWe analyzed the function of TIE1 as well as its synergy with TIE2 in the regulation of vein formation by employing genetic mouse models targeting Tie1 and Tek. Cardinal vein growth appeared normal in TIE1 deficient mice, whereas TIE2 deficiency altered the identity of cardinal vein endothelial cells with the aberrant expression of DLL4. Interestingly, the parallel growth of murine cutaneous veins along with arteries, which was initiated at approximately embryonic day 13.5, was retarded in mice lack of TIE1. Tie1 deletion disrupted also venous integrity, displaying increased sprouting angiogenesis and vascular bleeding. Abnormal venous sprouts with defective arteriovenous alignment were also observed in the mesenteries of Tie1 deleted mice. Mechanistically, TIE1 deficiency resulted in the decreased expression of venous regulators including TIE2 while angiogenic regulators were upregulated. The alteration of TIE2 level by TIE1 insufficiency was further confirmed by the siRNA-mediated knockdown of Tie1 in cultured endothelial cells. Additionally, combining the endothelial deletion of Tie1 with one null allele of Tek resulted in a progressive increase of vein-associated angiogenesis leading to the formation of vascular tufts in retinas, whereas the loss of Tie1 alone produced only a relatively mild venous defect.\n\nConclusionsFindings from this study imply that TIE1 and TIE2 act in a synergistic manner to restrict sprouting angiogenesis during vein formation.",

    "abstract": "Invasion risks may be influenced either negatively or positively by climate change, depending on the species. These can be predicted with species distribution models, but projections can be strongly affected by input environmental data (climate data source, Global Circulation Models and Shared Socio-economic Pathways SSP). We modelled the distribution of Phelsuma grandis and P. laticauda, two Malagasy reptiles that are spreading globally. We accounted for drivers of spread and establishment using socio-economic factors (e.g., distance from ports) and two climate data sources, i.e., Climatologies at High Resolution for the Earths and Land Surface Areas (CHELSA) and Worldclim. We further quantified the degree of agreement in invasion risk models that utilised CHELSA and Worldclim data for current and future conditions. Most areas identified as highly exposed to invasion risks were consistently identified (e.g. in Caribbean and Pacific Islands). However, projected risks differed locally. We also found notable differences in quantitative invasion risk (3% difference in suitability scores for P. laticauda and up to 14% for P. grandis) under current conditions. Despite both species native distributions overlap substantially, climate change will drive opposite responses on invasion risks by 2070 (decrease for P. grandis, increase for P. laticauda). Overall, projections of future invasion risks were the most affected by climate data source, followed by SSP. Our results highlight that assessments of current and future invasion risks are sensitive to the climate data source, especially in Islands. We stress the need to account for multiple climatologies when assessing invasion risks.",

Rates and acoustic features of isolation USVs change dramatically over the first two weeks of life, and there is also substantial variability in the rates and acoustic features of isolation USVs at a given postnatal age. The factors that contribute to within-age variability in isolation USVs remain largely unknown. Here, we explore the extent to which non-vocal behaviors of mouse pups relate to the within-age variability in rates and acoustic features of their USVs. We recorded non-vocal behaviors of isolated C57BL/6J mouse pups at four postnatal ages (postnatal days 5, 10, 15, and 20), measured rates of isolation USV production, and applied a combination of hand-picked acoustic feature measurements and an unsupervised machine learning-based vocal analysis method to examine USV acoustic features. When we considered different categories of non-vocal behavior, our analyses revealed that mice in all postnatal age groups produce higher rates of isolation USVs during active non-vocal behaviors than when lying still. Moreover, rates of isolation USVs are correlated with the intensity (i.e., magnitude) of non-vocal body and limb movements within a given trial. In contrast, USVs produced during different categories of non-vocal behaviors and during different intensities of non-vocal movement do not differ substantially in their acoustic features. Our findings suggest that levels of behavioral arousal contribute to within-age variability in rates, but not acoustic features, of mouse isolation USVs.",

    "abstract": "Pavlovian fear conditioning has been extensively used to study the behavioral and neural basis of defensive systems. In a typical procedure, a cue is paired with foot shock, and subsequent cue presentation elicits freezing, a behavior theoretically linked to predator detection. Studies have since shown a fear conditioned cue can elicit locomotion, a behavior that - in addition to jumping, and rearing - is theoretically linked to imminent or occurring predation. A criticism of studies observing fear conditioned cue-elicited locomotion is that responding is non-associative. We gave 24 rats (12 female) Pavlovian fear discrimination over a baseline of reward seeking. The within-subjects procedure had full controls for associative learning, consisting of three cues predicting unique foot shock probabilities: danger (p=1), uncertainty (p=0.25), and safety (p=0). TTL-triggered cameras captured 5 behavior frames/s prior to and during cue presentation. We scored 86,400 frames for nine discrete behaviors spanning reward, passive fear, and active fear. Temporal ethograms show that a fear conditioned cue elicits locomotion, jumping, and rearing that is maximal towards cue offset, when foot shock is imminent. A fear conditioned cue further suppresses reward-related behavior, and elicits freezing in a sex-specific manner. The differing temporal profiles and independent expression of these behaviors reveal a fear conditioned cue to orchestrate a rich and intricate suite of behaviors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVariation in tibia geometry is a risk factor for tibial stress fractures. Geometric variability in bones is often quantified using statistical shape modelling. Statistical shape models (SSM) offer a method to assess three-dimensional variation of structures and identify the source of variation. Although SSM have been used widely to assess long bones, there is limited open-source datasets of this kind. Overall, the creation of SSM can be an expensive process, that requires advanced skills. A publicly available tibia shape model would be beneficial as it enables researchers to improve skills. An opensource SSM could benefit health, sport and medicine with the potential to assess geometries suitable for medical equipment, and aid in clinical diagnosis. This study aimed to: (i) quantify tibial geometry using a SSM; and (ii) provide the SSM and associated code as an open-source dataset.\n\nMethodsLower limb computed tomography (CT) scans from the right tibia-fibula of 30 cadavers (male n = 20, female n =10) were obtained from the New Mexico Decedent Image Database. Tibias were segmented and reconstructed from the CT scans into both cortical and trabecular sections. Fibulas were segmented as a singular surface. The segmented bones (cortical and trabecular tibia; and fibula) were used to develop three SSM of the: (i) tibia; (ii) combined tibia and fibula; and (iii) tibial trabecular. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to obtain the three SSM, with the principal components (PCs) that explained 95% of the geometric variation retained.\n\nResultsOverall size variation was the main source of variation of all three models accounting for 90.31%, 84.24% and 85.06%, respectively. Other sources of geometric variation in the tibia surface models included overall (PC3) and midshaft thickness (PC2); prominence and size of the condyle plateau, tibial tuberosity, and anterior crest (PC4); and axial torsion of the tibial shaft (PC5). Further variations in the tibia-fibula model included midshaft thickness of the fibula (PC2); fibula head position relative to the tibia (PC2); tibia and fibula anterior-posterior curvature (PC4); fibula posterior curvature (PC5); tibia plateau rotation (PC5); and interosseous width (PC6). The main sources of variation in the tibia-trabecular model other than general size included variation in the medulla cavity diameter (PC2); overall thickness (PC3); and the relative volume of proximal and distal ends compared to middle (PC4).\n\nConclusionImportant variations that could increase the risk of tibial stress injury were observed in the tibia and tibia-fibula SSM. These included general tibial thickness, midshaft thickness, tibial length and medulla cavity diameter (indicative of cortical thickness). Further research is warranted to better understand the effect of these tibial and fibula shape characteristics on tibial stress, loading and injury risk. This SSM and associated code has been provided in an open-source dataset. The associated code includes three example applications: (i) generation of a random sample; (ii) reconstruction of trabecular surfaces; and (iii) reconstruction from palpable landmarks. The developed tibial surface models and statistical shape model will be made available for use at: https://simtk.org/projects/ssm_tibia.",

    "abstract": "Advanced in vitro human bone defect models can contribute to the evaluation of materials for in situ bone regeneration, addressing both translational and ethical concerns regarding animal models. In this study, we attempted to develop such a model to study material-driven regeneration, using a tissue engineering approach. By co-culturing human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hBMSCs) on silk fibroin scaffolds with in vitro critically sized defects, the growth of vascular-like networks and three-dimensional bone-like tissue was facilitated. After a model build-up phase of 28 days, materials were artificially implanted and HUVEC and hBMSC migration, cell-material interactions, and osteoinduction were evaluated 14 days after implantation. The materials physiologically relevant for bone regeneration included a platelet gel as blood clot mimic, cartilage spheres as soft callus mimics, and a fibrin gel as control. Although the in vitro model was limited in the evaluation of immune responses, hallmarks of physiological bone regeneration were observed in vitro. These included the endothelial cell chemotaxis induced by the blood clot mimic and the mineralization of the soft callus mimic. Therefore, the present in vitro model could contribute to an improved pre-clinical evaluation of biomaterials while reducing the need for animal experiments.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/502914v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ff8a7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dcbddcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@34c865org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15084f2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics technology complements the spatial information lost in single-cell RNA sequencing, which enables visualization and quantitative analysis of transcriptomics of cells in tissue sections. Although this technology is a promising tool to study complex biological processes, its popularization is limited by cumbersome barcoding steps. We presented a microfluidics-based barcoding strategy called Matrix-seq, which gets rid of both precision instruments and the in situ indexing. The deterministic barcoding matrix is fabricated by the crossflow of Barcode-X and Barcode-Y. The overlapping areas (spot) formed deterministic barcoding primers (Barcode-X-Y) via the ligation reaction. Matrices with different spot size (ranging from 10 to 50 m), which was decided by the width of microchannels, were fabricated and then applied to a mouse main olfactory bulb section and a mouse brain section. While maintaining high performance and resolution, this technology greatly reduces the technical threshold and cost of spatial barcoding. As a result, Matrix-seq can be rapidly applied in various fields including developmental biology, neuroscience and clinical pathology.\n\nTeaserMatrix-seq provides an orthogonal microchannel-based barcoding strategy for adjustable-resolution spatial transcriptomics.",

In this study, we developed a deep learning method for inter-protein contact prediction, referred to as DRN-1D2D_Inter. Specifically, we employed pretrained protein language models to generate structural information enriched input features to residual networks formed by dimensional hybrid residual blocks to perform inter-protein contact prediction. Extensively benchmarked DRN-1D2D_Inter on multiple datasets including both heteromeric PPIs and homomeric PPIs, we show DRN-1D2D_Inter consistently and significantly outperformed two state-of-the-art inter-protein contact prediction methods including GLINTER and DeepHomo, although both the latter two methods leveraged native structures of interacting proteins in the prediction, and DRN-1D2D_Inter made the prediction purely from sequences.",

To better understand disease etiology, there is consequently a need to understand how DNA encodes regulatory activity. Deep learning methods show great promise for modeling of biomolecular data from DNA sequence but are limited to large input data for training. Here, we develop ChromTransfer, a transfer learning method that uses a pre-trained, cell-type agnostic model of open chromatin regions as a basis for fine-tuning on regulatory sequences. We demonstrate superior performances with ChromTransfer for learning cell-type specific chromatin accessibility from sequence compared to models not informed by a pre-trained model. Importantly, ChromTransfer enables fine-tuning on small input data with minimal decrease in accuracy. We show that ChromTransfer uses sequence features matching binding site sequences of key transcription factors for prediction.

Here, we analyzed single-cell transcriptomes of matched primary tumor and metastasis from patient-derived xenograft models of breast cancer, demonstrating that primary tumor and metastatic cells show profound transcriptional differences across heterogeneous tumors. While primary tumor cells upregulated several metabolic genes, metastatic cells displayed a motility phenotype in micrometastatic lesions and increased stress response signaling during metastatic progression. Additionally, we identified gene signatures that are associated with the metastatic potential and correlated with patient outcomes. Poorly metastatic primary tumors showed increased immune-regulatory control that may prevent metastasis, whereas highly metastatic primary tumors upregulated markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that intra-tumor heterogeneity is dominated by epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity (EMP) which presented as a dynamic continuum with intermediate cell states that were characterized by novel, specific markers. These intermediate EMP markers correlated with worse patient outcomes and could serve as potential new therapeutic targets to block metastatic development.",

    "abstract": "Intrageneric dinosaur species have been being named for decades without either significant examination of the methods and standards used to do so, or widely publicized controversy over the results. The long standing assumption that all large known specimens of the iconic North American Tyrannosaurus consisted of just the one popular species T. rex was recently challenged with the first comprehensive test of the question. The result was the diagnosing and naming of two additional taxa, T. imperator and T. regina, based on a number of species levels characters regarding robustness and tooth proportions in the context of their stratigraphic distribution. In association a rare in-depth look was taken at the current state of naming vertebrate paleospecies, which it turns out are not highly rigorous because of inherent problems with the species concept and other matters. The results of the paper were severely criticized in in a manner never seen before for new dinosaur species even when based on less evidence. This study takes another look as the determination of paleospecies, and shows that many of the claims made in the criticisms regarding the Tyrannosaurus species work were inaccurate. New data on the proportions of strength bars in Tyrannosaurus skulls reinforces the basing of the three species in part on robustness factors, and allows all but one skull to be assigned to one of the species. These results allow the first detailed systematic examination of the supraorbital display bosses of the genus. They sort out as visually distinctive species specific ornaments based on both stratigraphic and taxonomic factors, strongly affirm that Tyrannosaurus was multispecific, and the species probably dimorphic. New skulls of T. rex show that the species sported - males probably -- striking display bosses not yet observed in other tyrannosaurids.",

VarID2 reveals enhanced nuclear versus cytoplasmic noise across cell types of the peripheral blood, and distinct regulatory modes stratified by correlation between noise, expression, and chromatin accessibility. Noise levels are minimal in murine hematopoietic stem cells and increase during both differentiation and ageing. Differential noise identified myeloid-biased Dlk1+ long-term-HSCs in aged mice with enhanced quiescence and self-renewal capacity.

    "abstract": "Microglia promptly mount an inflammatory response following detection of infectious agents or injuries in the central nervous system. Such function fundamentally depends upon dynamic modulation of gene expression. However, the signaling and epigenomic mechanisms that regulate the transcriptional process underlying microglial inflammatory activity are not well understood. To address this, we used RNA-seq, ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq to delineate gene signatures and activity across the repertoire of genomic regulatory elements of microglia engaged in acute and chronic neuroinflammatory activity. Systematic interrogations of the microglial population over time during a systemic inflammatory response revealed a coordinated, sequential activation of multiple gene programs associated with defense response, translation and cell cycling. Activation of these programs occurred in parallel with gain and loss of activity at 4,080 and 3,119 genomic cis-regulatory elements, respectively. Furthermore, computational analyses identified key transcriptional regulators, including Ets, AP-1, C/epb, Nf-{kappa}B, Irf, Runx, c-Myc and E2f family members, that display differential propensity for activity at gene promoters and promoter-distal cis-regulatory elements. Gene expression analyses also suggested that the transcriptional process likely contribute to the effective activity of numerous transcriptional regulators through the modulation of their mRNA levels. Finally, characterization of CD11c-positive microglia that emerge with chronic demyelinating brain lesions suggested that Egr2, Mef2 members and E-box-binding factors such as Tfeb and Mitf contribute to the enhanced phagosomal activity of this inflammatory subset. Loss-of-function experiments validated that Mef2a in microglia is necessary for the acquisition of the CD11c-positive phenotype. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the inflammatory activity of microglia arises through an intricate, ultimately context-dependent, interplay between signaling pathways, genomic regulatory elements and the transcriptional machinery.",

The rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been hypothesized to be central to these abilities.

To settle this debate, we recorded from the full dorso-ventral extent of mPFC in each of 8 rats, as they performed a complex economic decision task. These data revealed four distinct functional domains within mPFC that closely mirrored anatomically-identified subregions, including novel evidence to divide prelimbic cortex into dorsal and ventral components. We found that dorsal aspects of mPFC (ACC, dPL) were more involved in processing information about active decisions, while ventral aspects (vPL, IL) were more engaged in motivational factors.\n\nImpact StatementDiehl and Redish describe how the rodent medial prefrontal cortex is composed of functionally distinct subregions that process economic decision information differentially along a dorso-ventral gradient.",

Place cells were recorded from mice with ibotenic acid lesions of the MEC (n = 7) and from sham-lesioned mice (n = 6) following 90{degrees} rotations of either distal landmarks or proximal cues in a cue controlled environment. We found that lesions of the MEC impaired the anchoring of place fields to distal landmarks, but not proximal cues. We also observed that, relative to sham-lesioned mice, place cells in animals with MEC lesions exhibited significantly reduced spatial information and increased sparsity. These results support the view that distal landmark information reaches the hippocampus via the MEC, but that proximal cue information can do so via an alternative neural pathway.",

    "abstract": "Single-pulse electrical stimulation in the nervous system, often called cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP) measurement, is an important technique to understand how brain regions interact with one another. Voltages are measured from implanted electrodes in one brain area while stimulating another with brief current impulses separated by several seconds. Historically, researchers have tried to understand the significance of evoked voltage polyphasic deflections by visual inspection, but no general-purpose tool has emerged to understand their shapes or describe them mathematically. We describe and illustrate a new technique to parameterize brain stimulation data, where voltage response traces are projected into one another using a semi-normalized dot product. The length of timepoints from stimulation included in the dot product is varied to obtain a temporal profile of structural significance, and the peak of the profile uniquely identifies the duration of the response. Using linear kernel PCA, a canonical response shape is obtained over this duration, and then single-trial traces are parameterized as a projection of this canonical shape with a residual term. Such parameterization allows for dissimilar trace shapes from different brain areas to be directly compared by quantifying cross-projection magnitudes, response duration, canonical shape projection amplitudes, signal-to-noise ratios, explained variance, and statistical significance. Artifactual trials are automatically identified by outliers in sub-distributions of cross-projection magnitude, and rejected. This technique, which we call \"Canonical Response Parameterization\" (CRP) dramatically simplifies the study of CCEP shapes, and may also be applied in a wide range of other settings involving event-triggered data.\n\nAuthor summaryWe introduce a new machine learning technique for quantifying the structure of responses to single-pulse intracranial electrical brain stimulation. This approach allows voltage response traces of very different shape to be compared with one another. A tool like this has been needed to replace the status quo, where researchers may understand their data in terms of discovered structure rather than in terms of a pre-assigned, hand-picked, feature. The method compares single-trial responses pairwise to understand if there is a reproducible shape and how long it lasts. When significant structure is identified, the shape underlying it is isolated and each trial is parameterized in terms of this shape. This simple parameterization enables quantification of statistical significance, signal-to-noise ratio, explained variance, and average voltage of the response. Differently-shaped voltage traces from any setting can be compared with any other in a succinct mathematical framework. This versatile tool to quantify single-pulse stimulation data should facilitate a blossoming in the study of brain connectivity using implanted electrodes.",

    "abstract": "White matter deficits are a common neuropathologic finding in neurologic disorders, including HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). In HAND, the persistence of white matter alterations despite suppressive antiretroviral (ARV) therapy suggests that ARVs may be directly contributing to these impairments. Here, we report that a frontline ARV, bictegravir (BIC), significantly attenuates remyelination following cuprizone-mediated demyelination, a model that recapitulates acute demyelination, but has no impact on already formed mature myelin. Mechanistic studies in vitro revealed that treatment with BIC leads to significant decrease in mature oligodendrocytes accompanied by lysosomal de-acidification and impairment of lysosomal degradative capacity with no alterations in lysosomal membrane permeability or total lysosome number. Activation of the endolysosomal cation channel TRPML1 prevents both lysosomal de-acidification and impairment of oligodendrocyte differentiation by BIC. Lastly, we show that de-acidification of lysosomes by compounds that raise lysosomal pH is sufficient to prevent maturation of oligodendrocytes. Overall, this study has uncovered a critical role for lysosomal acidification in modulating oligodendrocyte function and has implications for neurologic diseases characterized by lysosomal dysfunction and white matter abnormalities.\n\nTable of ContentsO_ST_ABSMain PointsC_ST_ABSO_LIThe antiretroviral, bictegravir, inhibited remyelination through OPC differentiation blockade and had no effect on mature myelin\nC_LIO_LIBictegravir inhibits oligodendrocyte differentiation through de-acidification of lysosomes and this was prevented via activation of the lysosomal channel TRPML1\nC_LIO_LIDe-acidification of lysosomes by other drugs (e.g. bafilomycin A) is sufficient to inhibit oligodendrocyte maturation\nC_LI\n\nTable of Contents Image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/502855v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12f4d8borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8be876org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ad1a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@108631d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Apoptotic cell clearance (efferocytosis), a process essential for organismal homeostasis, is performed by phagocytes that inhabit a wide range of environments, including physiologic hypoxia. Here, we find macrophages, the predominant tissue-resident phagocyte, display enhanced efferocytosis under prolonged (chronic) physiological hypoxia, characterized by increased internalization and accelerated degradation of apoptotic cells. Analysis of mRNA and protein programs revealed that chronic physiological hypoxia induces two distinct but complimentary states in macrophages. The first,  primed state consists of concomitant induction of transcriptional and translational programs broadly associated with metabolism in apoptotic cell-naive macrophages that persist during efferocytosis. The second,  poised state consists of transcription, but not translation, of phagocyte function programs in apoptotic cell-naive macrophages that are subsequently translated during efferocytosis. Importantly, we discovered that both states are necessary for enhanced continual efferocytosis. Mechanistically, we find that one such  primed state consists of the efficient flux of glucose into a noncanonical pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) loop, whereby PPP-derived intermediates cycle back through the PPP to enhance production of NADPH. Furthermore, we found that PPP-derived NADPH directly supports enhanced continual efferocytosis under chronic physiological hypoxia via its role in phagolysosomal maturation and maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis. Thus, macrophages residing under chronic physiological hypoxia adopt states that both support cell fitness and ensure ability to perform essential homeostatic functions rapidly and safely.\n\nHighlights- Macrophages residing in chronic physiological hypoxia have enhanced apoptotic cell uptake and degradation\n- Chronic physiological hypoxia induces both primed and poised states in macrophages\n- Both primed and poised state programs directly support enhanced continual efferocytosis\n- A noncanonical PPP loop, a unique primed state, directly supports enhanced efferocytosis and maintains redox homeostasis",

    "abstract": "The pattern recognition receptor RIG-I is essential for the recognition of viral dsRNA and the activation of a cell-autonomous antiviral response. Upon stimulation, RIG-I triggers a signaling cascade leading to the expression of cytokines, most prominently type I and III interferons (IFNs). IFNs are secreted and signal in an auto- and paracrine manner to trigger the expression of a large variety of IFN-stimulated genes, which in concert establish an antiviral state of the cell. While the topology of this pathway has been studied quite intensively, the dynamics, particularly of the RIG-I-mediated IFN induction, is much less understood. Here, we employed electroporation-based transfection to synchronously activate the RIG-I signaling pathway, enabling us to characterize the kinetics and dynamics of cell-intrinsic innate immune signaling to virus infections. By employing an A549 IFNAR1/IFNLR deficient cell line, we could analyze the difference between the primary RIG-I signaling phase and the secondary signaling phase downstream of the IFN receptors. We further used our quantitative data to set up and calibrate a comprehensive dynamic mathematical model of the RIG-I and IFN signaling pathways. This model accurately predicts the kinetics of signaling events downstream of dsRNA recognition by RIG-I as well as the feedback and signal amplification by secreted IFN and JAK/STAT signaling. We have furthermore investigated the impact of various viral immune antagonists on the signaling dynamics experimentally, and we utilized the here described modelling approach to simulate and in silico study these critical virus-host interactions. Our work provides a comprehensive insight into the signaling events occurring early upon virus infection and opens up new avenues to study and disentangle the complexity of the host-virus interface.",

    "abstract": "Peptide hormones and neuropeptides form a diverse class of signaling molecules that control essential processes in animals. Despite several breakthroughs in peptide discovery, many signaling peptides remain undiscovered. Recently, we demonstrated the use of somatostatin-like toxins from cone snail venom to identify homologous signaling peptides in prey. Here, we demonstrate that this toxin-based approach can be systematically applied to the discovery of other unknown bilaterian signaling peptides. Using large sequencing datasets, we searched for homologies between cone snail toxins and putative peptides from several important model organisms representing the snails prey. We identified five toxin families that share strong similarities with previously unknown signaling peptides from mollusks and annelids. One of the peptides was also identified in rotifers, brachiopods, platyhelminths, and arthropods, and another was found to be structurally related to crustacean hyperglycemic hormone, a peptide not previously known to exist in Spiralia. Based on several lines of evidence we propose that these signaling peptides not only exist but serve important physiological functions. Finally, we propose that the discovery pipeline developed here can be more broadly applied to other systems in which one organism has evolved molecules to manipulate the physiology of another.",

However, geochemical reconstructions of the ancient sulfur cycle are confounded by ambiguous isotopic signals. Here, we use phylogenetic reconciliation to ascertain the timing of ancient sulfur cycling gene events across the tree of life. Our results suggest that metabolisms using sulfide oxidation emerged in the Archean, but those involving thiosulfate emerged only after the Great Oxidation Event. Our data reveal that observed geochemical signatures resulted not from the expansion of a single type of organism, but were instead associated with genomic innovation across the biosphere. Moreover, our results provide the first indication of organic sulfur cycling from the mid-Proterozoic onwards, with implications for climate regulation and atmospheric biosignatures. Overall, our results provide insights into how the biological sulfur cycle evolved in tandem with the redox state of the early Earth.\n\nTeaser: Phylogenomics analyses reveal that the evolution of microbial sulfur metabolisms co-evolved with the redox state of the early Earth.",

    "abstract": "Sperm cells are exceptionally morphologically diverse across taxa. However, morphology can be quite uniform within species, particularly for species where females copulate with many males per reproductive bout. Strong sexual selection in these promiscuous species is widely hypothesized to reduce intraspecific sperm variation. Conversely, we hypothesize that intraspecific sperm size variation may be maintained by high among-female variation in the size of sperm storage organs, assuming that paternity success improves when sperm are compatible in size with the sperm storage organ. We use individual-based simulations and an analytical model to evaluate how selection on sperm size depends on promiscuity level and variation in sperm storage organ size (hereafter, female preference variation). Simulated species with high promiscuity showed stabilizing selection on sperm when female preference variation was low, and disruptive selection when female preference variation was high, consistent with the analytical model results. With low promiscuity (2-3 mates per female), selection on sperm was stabilizing for all levels of female preference variation in the simulations, contrasting with the analytical model. Promiscuity level, or mate sampling, thus has a strong impact on the selection resulting from female preferences. Further, for species with low promiscuity, disruptive selection on male traits will occur under more limited circumstances than many previous models suggest. Variation in female sperm storage organs likely has strong implications for intraspecific sperm variation in highly promiscuous species, but likely does not explain differences in intraspecific sperm variation for less promiscuous taxa.",

    "abstract": "Obligate pollination mutualisms, in which plant and pollinator lineages depend on each other for reproduction, often exhibit high levels of species-specificity. However, cases in which two or more pollinator species share a single host species (host sharing), or two or more host species share a single pollinator species (pollinator sharing), are known to occur in current ecological time. Further, evidence for host switching in evolutionary time is increasingly being recognized in these systems. The degree to which departures from strict specificity differentially affect the potential for hybridization and introgression in the associated host or pollinator is unclear. We addressed this question using genome-wide sequence data from five sympatric Panamanian free-standing fig species (Ficus subgenus Pharmacosycea, section Pharmacosycea) and their six associated fig pollinator wasp species (Tetrapus). Two of the five fig species, F. glabrata and F. maxima, were found to regularly share pollinators. In these species, ongoing hybridization was demonstrated by the detection of several first-generation (F1) hybrid individuals and historical introgression was indicated by phylogenetic network analysis. In contrast, although two of the pollinator species regularly share hosts, all six species were genetically distinct and deeply divergent, with no evidence for either hybridization or introgression. This pattern is consistent with results from other obligate pollination mutualisms, suggesting that, in contrast to their host plants, pollinators appear to be reproductively isolated, even when different species of pollinators mate in shared hosts.",

In the FT, 22 cell clusters integrated into 11 cell types, including ciliated and secretory epithelial cells, while the ovary had 17 distinct cell clusters defining 6 major cell types. The dominant cell type in both the postmenopausal ovary and FT was stromal cells, which expressed several genes associated with aging. The fimbrial end of the FT had a significant number and variety of immune cells and active communication with the ovary; the ovary contained mostly stromal cells but few immune cells. The epithelial cells of the normal FT expressed multiple ovarian cancer risk-associated genes (CCDC170, RND3, TACC2, STK33, and ADGB). By integrating paired single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility data we found that the regulatory landscape of the fimbriae was markedly different from the isthmus and ampulla.

Whether {beta}-catenin targets genomic regions simultaneously or in a temporal fashion, and how this impacts the chromatin dynamics to modulate cell behavior, is currently unknown. Here we find that {beta}-catenin binds different loci at each time-point after stimulation, implying that the definition of Wnt-targets is fundamentally temporal. This process is intrinsically cell-type specific. In fact, Wnt/{beta}-catenin progressively shapes the chromatin of human embryonic stem cells consistent with their mesodermal differentiation: we call this genomic response plastic. In embryonic kidney cells, on the other hand, Wnt/{beta}-catenin drives a transient chromatin opening, followed by a re-establishment of the pre-stimulation state: a response that we define elastic. Finally, the Wnt-induced transient chromatin opening requires {beta}-catenin, suggesting a previously unappreciated pioneering role for this molecule. We submit that the plastic-vs-elastic behavior constitutes part of the mechanism explaining how Wnt/{beta}-catenin drives divergent cell-fate decisions during development and homeostasis.",

We achieve an alignment accuracy of 70 m to allow a 2.8X depth-of-field extension between the twin foci. We optimize the phase profile across the whole back aperture through a genetic algorithm that considers the primary GRIN lens aberrations, optical property of the submersion media, and axial intensity loss from tissue scattering in a Fourier optics forward model.

    "abstract": "How the locus-specificity of epigenetic modifications is regulated remains an unanswered question. A contributing mechanism is that epigenetic enzymes are recruited to specific loci by DNA binding factors recognizing particular sequence motifs (referred to as epi-motifs). Using these motifs to predict biological outputs depending on local epigenetic state such as somatic mutation rates would confirm their functionality. Here, we used DNA motifs including known TF motifs and epi-motifs as a surrogate of epigenetic signals to predict somatic mutation rates in 13 cancers at an average 23kbp resolution. We implemented an interpretable neural network model, called contextual regression, to successfully learn the universal relationship between mutations and DNA motifs, and uncovered motifs that are most impactful on the regional mutation rates such as TP53 and epi-motifs associated with H3K9me3. Furthermore, we identified genomic regions with significantly higher mutation rates than the expected values in each individual tumor and demonstrated that such cancer-specific regions can accurately predict cancer types.

    "abstract": "Plasmids are mobile genetic elements important for bacterial adaptation. The study of plasmids from sequencing data is challenging because short reads produce fragmented assemblies, requiring of subsequent discrimination between chromosome and plasmid sequences. Although circularized assemblies are now possible using long-read data, there is still a need to differentiate plasmids from other circular elements. Here, we present plaSquid, a dockerized tool developed in Nextflow that expands plasmid detection and improves replicon typing and mobility groups classification schemes, outperforming previously available methods in both precision and sensitivity. When applied to [~]10.5 million metagenomic contigs, plaSquid revealed a 2.7-fold increase in plasmid phylogenetic diversity. Also, we used plaSquid to uncover a significant role of plasmids in the widespread distribution of clinically-relevant antimicrobial resistance genes in the built environment, from cities to spacecraft. Together, we present an improved approach to study plasmid biology from fragmented or circularized genomic and metagenomic assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Many traditional methods for analyzing gene-gene relationships focus on positive and negative correlations, both of which are a kind of  symmetric relationship. However, genes can also exhibit  asymmetric relationships, such as  if-then relationships used in boolean circuits. In this paper we develop a very general method that can be used to detect biclusters within gene-expression data that involve subsets of genes which are enriched for these  boolean-asymmetric relationships (BARs). These BAR-biclusters can correspond to heterogeneity that is driven by asymmetric gene-gene interactions, rather than more standard symmetric interactions. We apply our method to a single-cell RNA-sequencing data-set, demonstrating that the statistically-significant BAR-biclusters indeed contain additional information not present within more traditional  boolean-symmetric-biclusters. For example, the BAR-biclusters involve different subsets of cells, and highlight different gene-pathways within the data-set. Moreover, by combining the boolean-asymmetric- and boolean-symmetric-signals, one can build linear classifiers which outperform those built using only traditional boolean-symmetric signals.\n\nAuthor summaryOne important step when analyzing large data-sets is to search for  heterogeneity, i.e., subsets of the data that exhibit special characteristics. In the context of gene-expression data, this heterogeneity can take the form of a  bicluster: a subset of samples across which certain genes interact in a special way. Traditionally, strategies for detecting biclusters have focused on gene-gene relationships such as correlations and anti-correlations; that is to say, gene-subsets that act in concert. In this paper we discuss a simple strategy for detecting biclusters that exhibit more general gene-gene relationships, such as one gene serving as a prerequisite for the expression of another, or a pair of genes which mutually exclude one another. Using a data-set from a study of Alzheimers disease, we demonstrate that these more general biclusters can be quite statistically significant, and can contain novel information not readily found in more traditional biclusters.",

    "abstract": "The ability of tissues to sustain and withstand mechanical stress is critical to tissue development and healthy tissue maintenance. The mechanical properties of tissues are typically considered to be dominated by the fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) component of tissues. Fiber network mechanics can capture certain mechanical features of tissues, such as shear strain stiffening, but is insufficient in describing the compressive response of certain tissues and blood clots that are rich in extracellular matrix. To understand the mechanical response of tissues, we employ a contemporary mechanical model, a fibrous network of fibrin embedded with inert bead inclusions that preserve the volume-conserving constraints of cells in tissues. Combining bulk mechanical rheology and a custom imaging device, we show that the presence of inclusions alters the local dynamic remodeling of the networks undergoing uniaxial compressive strains and demonstrate non-affine correlated motion within a fiber-bead network, predicted to stretch fibers in the network and lead to the ability of the network to stiffen under compression, a key feature of real tissues. These findings have important implications for understanding how local structural properties of cells and ECM fibers impact the bulk mechanical response of real tissues.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is a hallmark of cancer and increasingly realized as a mechanism of resistance in androgen indifferent prostate tumors. It is critical to identify mechanisms and actionable targets driving phenotypic plasticity. Here, we report that loss of tristetraprolin (TTP, gene ZFP36), an RNA binding protein that regulates mRNA stability increases NF-{kappa}B activation and is associated with higher rates of aggressive disease and early recurrence in primary prostate cancer (PCa). We examined the clinical and biological impact of ZFP36 loss combined with PTEN loss, a known driver of PCa. Combined loss of PTEN and ZFP36 expression was associated with increased risk of recurrence in multiple independent primary PCa cohorts, and significantly reduced overall survival and time to progression following castration in genetically engineered mouse models. ZFP36 loss alters the cell state that is driven by PTEN loss, demonstrated by positive enrichment of gene sets including EMT, inflammation, TNF/NF-{kappa}B, IL6-JAK/STAT3. ZFP36 loss also induces enrichment of multiple gene sets involved in cell migration, chemotaxis, and proliferation. Use of the NF-{kappa}B inhibitor dimethylaminoparthenolide induced significant therapeutic responses in tumors with PTEN and ZFP36 co-loss and reversed castration resistance. This work identifies a novel molecular mechanism driving phenotypic plasticity and castration resistance through loss of ZFP36 expression, that can be reversed by inhibition of NF-{kappa}B activity.",
