    "abstract": "To study a core component of human intelligence--our ability to combine the meaning of words--neuroscientists have looked to theories from linguistics. However, linguistic theories are insufficient to account for all brain responses that reflect linguistic composition. In contrast, we adopt a data-driven computational approach to study the combined meaning of words beyond their individual meaning. We term this product \"supra-word meaning\" and investigate its neural bases by devising a computational representation for it and using it to predict brain recordings from two imaging modalities with complementary spatial and temporal resolutions. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we reveal that hubs that are thought to process lexical-level meaning also maintain supra-word meaning, suggesting a common substrate for lexical and combinatorial semantics. Surprisingly, we cannot detect supra-word meaning in magnetoencephalography, which suggests the hypothesis that composed meaning might be maintained through a different neural mechanism than the synchronized firing of pyramidal cells. This sensitivity difference has implications for past neuroimaging results and future wearable neurotechnology.",

    "abstract": "53BP1 is a key DNA repair protein that regulates double strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice. It assembles a complex, whose loss reverses BRCA1 deficient cells sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors potentially by antagonizing DSB end resection. 53BP1 is critical for immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination (CSR), that is mediated by the generation and repair of DSBs. Here we identify a deubiquitylase, USP47, as a 53BP1 associated protein that regulates its function in these processes. USP47 loss results in 53BP1 protein instability in a proteasome dependent manner and in reduced 53BP1 ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF). Like 53BP1, USP47 depletion results in enhanced homologous recombination repair, and defective immunoglobulin CSR. It is also required for resistance to DNA damaging agents. We identify a complex of 53BP1, USP47, Fen1, and Recql1 that regulates a microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ), a repair pathway that is involved in CSR. Altogether, our findings implicate USP47 in DNA DSB repair at least through regulating a novel 53BP1 associated complex.",

    "abstract": "Tetrameric voltage-gated K+ channels have four identical voltage sensor domains, and they regulate channel gating. KCNQ1 (Kv7.1) is a voltage-gated K+ channel, and its auxiliary subunit KCNE proteins dramatically regulate its gating. For example, KCNE3 makes KCNQ1 a constitutively open channel at physiological voltages by affecting the voltage sensor movement. However, how KCNE proteins regulate the voltage sensor domain is largely unknown. In this study, by utilizing the KCNQ1-KCNE3-calmodulin complex structure, we thoroughly surveyed amino acid residues on KCNE3 and the S1 segment of the KCNQ1 voltage sensor facing each other. By changing the side-chain bulkiness of these interacting amino acid residues, we found that the distance between the S1 segment and KCNE3 is elaborately optimized to achieve the constitutive activity. In addition, we identified two pairs of KCNQ1 and KCNE3 mutants that partially restored constitutive activity by co-expression. Our work suggests that tight binding of the S1 segment and KCNE3 is crucial for controlling the voltage sensor domains.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAnnotation of biomedical entities with ontology classes provides for formal semantic analysis and mobilisation of background knowledge in determining their relationships. To date enrichment analysis has been routinely employed to identify classes that are over-represented in annotations across sets of groups, such as biosample gene expression profiles or patient phenotypes. These approaches, however, usually consider only univariate relationships, make limited use of the semantic features of ontologies, and provide limited information and evaluation of the explanatory power of both singular and grouped candidate classes. Moreover, they do not solve the problem of deriving cohesive, characteristic, and discriminatory sets of classes for entity groups.\n\nResultsWe have developed a new method, Klarigi, which introduces multiple scoring heuristics for identification of classes that are both compositional and discriminatory for groups of entities annotated with ontology classes. The tool includes a novel algorithm for derivation of multivariable semantic explanations for entity groups, makes use of semantic inference through live use of an ontology reasoner, and includes a classification method for identifying the discriminatory power of candidate sets. We describe the design and implementation of Klarigi, and evaluate its use in two test cases, comparing and contrasting methods and results with literature and enrichment analysis methods.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate that Klarigi produces characteristic and discriminatory explanations for groups of biomedical entities in two settings. We also show that these explanations recapitulate and extend the knowledge held in existing biomedical databases and literature for several diseases. We conclude that Klarigi provides a distinct and valuable perspective on biomedical datasets when compared with traditional enrichment methods, and therefore constitutes a new method by which biomedical datasets can be explored, contributing to improved insight into semantic data.",

    "abstract": "Stress defense and cell growth are inversely related in bulk culture analyses; however, these studies miss substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, thus obscuring true phenotypic relationships. Here, we devised a microfluidics system to characterize multiple phenotypes in single yeast cells over time before, during, and after salt stress. The system measured cell and colony size, growth rate, and cell-cycle phase along with nuclear trans-localization of two transcription factors: stress-activated Msn2 that regulates defense genes and Dot6 that represses ribosome biogenesis genes during an active stress response. By tracking cells dynamically, we discovered unexpected discordance between Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that revealed subpopulations of cells with distinct growth properties. Surprisingly, post-stress growth recovery was positively corelated with activation of the Dot6 repressor. In contrast, cells lacking Dot6 displayed slower growth acclimation, even though they grow normally in the absence of stress. We show that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 response display faster production of Msn2-regulated Ctt1 protein, separable from the contribution of Msn2. These results are consistent with the model that transcriptional repression during acute stress in yeast provides a protective response, likely by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.",

    "abstract": "Predictive remapping -- the ability of cells in retinotopic brain areas to transiently exhibit spatio-temporal retinotopic shifts beyond the spatial extent of their classical receptive fields -- has been proposed as a primary mechanism that stabilizes our percept of the visual world around the time of saccadic eye movements. Despite the well documented effects of predictive remapping, no study to date has been able to provide a mechanistic account of the neural computations and architecture that actively mediate this ubiquitous phenomenon. We propose a novel neurobiologically inspired general model of predictive remapping in which the underlying pre-saccadic attentional and oculomotor signals manifest as three temporally overlapping forces that act on retinotopic brain areas. These three forces - a centripetal one toward the center of gaze, a convergent one toward the saccade target and a translational one parallel to the saccade trajectory - act in an inverse force field and govern the spatio-temporal dynamics of predictive remapping of population receptive fields. The predictions of our model are borne out by the spatio-temporal changes in sensitivity to probe stimuli in human subjects around the time of an eye movement and are consistent with findings of predictive shifts in the receptive fields of cells in the superior colliculus, frontal eye fields, lateral intraparietal area, and visual area V4.",

    "abstract": "Bordetella bronchiseptica injects virulence proteins called effectors into host cells via a type III secretion system (T3SS) conserved among many Gram-negative bacteria. Small proteins called chaperones are required for stabilizing some T3SS components or localizing them to the T3SS machinery. In a previous study, we identified a chaperone-like protein named Bcr4 that regulates T3SS activity in B. bronchiseptica. Bcr4 does not show strong sequence similarity to well-studied T3SS proteins of other bacteria, and its function remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which Bcr4 controls T3SS activity. A pull-down assay revealed that Bcr4 interacts with BscI, based on its homology to other bacterial proteins, to be an inner rod protein of the T3SS machinery. An additional pull-down assay using truncated Bcr4 derivatives and secretion profiles of B. bronchiseptica producing truncated Bcr4 derivatives showed that the Bcr4 C-terminal region is necessary for the interaction with BscI and activation of the T3SS. Moreover, the deletion of BscI abolished the secretion of type III secreted proteins from B. bronchiseptica and the translocation of a cytotoxic effector into cultured mammalian cells. Finally, we showed that BscI is unstable in the absence of Bcr4. These results suggest that Bcr4 supports the construction of the T3SS machinery by stabilizing BscI. This is the first demonstration of a chaperone for the T3SS inner rod protein among the virulence bacteria possessing the T3SS.\n\nImportanceThe type III secretion system (T3SS) is a needle-like complex that projects outward from bacterial cells. Bordetella bronchiseptica uses the T3SS to inject virulence proteins into host cells. Our previous study reported that a protein named Bcr4 is essential for the secretion of virulence proteins from B. bronchiseptica bacterial cells and delivery through the T3SS. Because other bacteria lack a Bcr4 homologue, the function of Bcr4 has not been elucidated. In this study, we discovered that Bcr4 interacts with BscI, a component of the T3SS machinery. We showed that a B. bronchiseptica BscI-deficient strain was unable to secrete type III secreted proteins. Furthermore, in a B. bronchiseptica strain that overproduces T3SS component proteins, Bcr4 is required to maintain BscI in bacterial cells. These results suggest that Bcr4 stabilizes BscI to allow construction of the T3SS in B. bronchiseptica.",

We recapitulate this off-target effect in Caenorhabditis elegans, which does not have an ER ortholog. We find that different bacteria dramatically modulate tamoxifen toxicity in C. elegans, with a three-order of magnitude difference between animals fed Escherichia coli, Comamonas aquatica, and Bacillus subtilis. Remarkably, host fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis mitigates tamoxifen toxicity, and different bacteria provide the animal with different FAs, resulting in distinct FA profiles. Surprisingly these bacteria modulate tamoxifen toxicity by different death mechanisms, some of which are modulated by FA supplementation and others by antioxidants. Together, this work reveals a complex interplay between microbiota, FA metabolism and tamoxifen toxicity that may provide a blueprint for similar studies in more complex mammals.",

    "abstract": "A significant fraction of sudden death in children and young adults is due to myocarditis, an inflammatory disease of the heart, most often caused by viral infection. Here we used integrated single-cell and spatial transcriptomics to create a high-resolution, spatially resolved map of reovirus-induced myocarditis in neonatal murine hearts. We assayed hearts collected at three timepoints after reovirus infection and studied the temporal, spatial, and cellular heterogeneity of host-virus interactions. We further assayed the intestine, the primary site of reovirus infection to establish a full chronology of molecular events that ultimately lead to myocarditis. We implemented targeted enrichment of viral transcripts to establish the cellular targets of the virus in the intestine and the heart. Our data give insight into the cell-type specificity of innate immune responses, and into the transcriptional states of inflamed cardiac cells in reovirus-infected heart. We find that inflamed endothelial cells recruit cytotoxic T cells and undergo pyroptosis in the myocarditic tissue. Analyses of spatially restricted gene expression in myocarditic regions and the border zone around those regions identified immune-mediated cell-type specific injury and stress responses. Overall, we observe a dynamic and complex network of cellular phenotypes and cell-cell interactions associated with viral myocarditis.",

Through a zebrafish forward genetic screen, we identified the mTOR kinase, a master regulator of metabolism, as an early host resistance factor in tuberculosis. We found that mTOR complex 1 protects macrophages from mycobacterium-induced death by enabling infection-induced increases in mitochondrial energy metabolism fueled by glycolysis. These metabolic adaptations are required to prevent mitochondrial damage and death caused by the secreted mycobacterial virulence determinant ESAT-6. Thus, the host can effectively counter this early critical mycobacterial virulence mechanism simply by regulating energy metabolism, thereby allowing pathogen-specific immune mechanisms time to develop. Our findings may explain why Mycobacterium tuberculosis, albeit humanitys most lethal pathogen, is successful in only a minority of infected individuals.",

    "abstract": "Modern, high-density neuronal recordings reveal at ever higher precision how information is represented by neural populations. Still, we lack the tools to understand these processes bottom-up, emerging from the biophysical properties of neurons, synapses, and network structure. The concept of the dynamic gain function, a spectrally resolved approximation of a populations coding capability, has the potential to link cell-level properties to network-level performance. However, the dynamic gains shape is co-determined by axonal and somatodendritic parameters and the populations operating regime. Previously, this complexity precluded an understanding of any individual parameters impact. Here, we decomposed the dynamic gain function into three components corresponding to separate signal transformations. This allowed attribution of network-level encoding features to specific cell-level parameters. Applying the method to data from real neurons and biophysically plausible models, we found: 1. The encoding bandwidth of real neurons, approximately 400 Hz, is constrained by the voltage dependence of axonal currents during early action potential initiation. 2. State-of-the-art models only achieve encoding bandwidths around 100 Hz and are limited mainly by subthreshold processes instead. 3. Large dendrites and low-threshold potassium currents modulate the bandwidth by shaping the subthreshold stimulus-to-voltage transformation. Our decomposition provides physiological interpretations when the dynamic gain curve changes, for instance during spectrinopathies and neurodegeneration. By pinpointing shortcomings of current models, it also guides inference of neuron models best suited for large-scale network simulations.\n\nAuthor summaryThe dynamic gain function quantifies how neurons can engage in collective, networklevel activity, shape brain rhythms and information encoding. Its shape results from a complex interaction between properties of different molecules (ion channels) and cell compartments (morphology, resistance), and is so far only understood for the simplest neuron models. Here we provide an interpretable analysis, decomposing the dynamic gain based on the stimulus transformation steps in individual neurons. We apply the decomposition to data from real neurons and complex models, and attribute changes of the dynamic gain to specific sub- and suprathreshold processes. Using this decomposition method, we reveal the relevance of subthreshold potassium channels for ultrafast information encoding and expose the shortcomings of even the state-of-the-art neuron models.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus anthracis overcomes host immune responses by producing capsule and secreting toxins. Production of these virulence factors in response to entering the host environment was shown to be regulated by atxA, the major virulence regulator, known to be activated by HCO3- and CO2. While toxin production is regulated directly by atxA, capsule production is independently mediated by two regulators; acpA and acpB. In addition, it was demonstrated that acpA has at least two promotors, one of them shared with atxA. We used a genetic approach to study capsule and toxin production under different conditions. Unlike previous works utilizing NBY-HCO3- medium under CO2 enriched conditions, we used a sDMEM-based medium. Thus, toxin and capsule production can be induced in ambient or CO2 enriched atmosphere. Using this system, we could differentiate between induction by 10% NRS, 10% CO2 or 0.75% HCO3-. In response to high CO2, capsule production is induced by acpA in an atxA-independent manner, with little to no toxin (protective antigen PA) production. atxA is activated in response to serum independently of CO2, inducing toxin and capsule production in an acpA or acpB dependent manner. HCO3- was also found to activate atxA, but in non-physiological concentrations. Our findings may help explain the first stages of inhalational infection, in which spores germinating in dendritic cells require protection (by encapsulation) without affecting cell migration to the draining lymph-node by toxin secretion.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhen environmental conditions are unpredictable, expressing alternative phenotypes spreads the risk of failure, a mixed strategy called bet-hedging. In the southern part of its range, the Parsley Frog Pelodytes punctatus breeds both in autumn and in spring. Our aim was to study the breeding phenology and reproductive success associated with the use of those two seasonal niches to understand how this breeding strategy can be maintained. Field surveys revealed that breeding phenology was typically bimodal with a higher breeding effort in autumn. More importantly, in spring, the survival rate of offspring was severely reduced by the presence of autumn tadpoles, indicating a clear priority effect. However, the autumn cohort often failed to survive over winter, in which case spring cohorts were often successful. Based on those results, we constructed a model in which females can allocate a variable portion of eggs to each season and added a priority effect. We conclude that the existence of the two breeding seasons may indeed constitute a bet-hedging strategy.",

    "abstract": "In nucleosomes, histone N-terminal tails exist in dynamic equilibrium between free/accessible and collapsed/DNA-bound states. The latter state is expected to impact histone N-termini availability to the epigenetic machinery. Notably, H3 tail acetylation (e.g., K9ac, K14ac, K18ac) is linked to increased H3K4me3 engagement by the BPTF PHD finger, but it is unknown if this mechanism has broader extension. Here we show that H3 tail acetylation promotes nucleosomal accessibility to other H3K4 methyl readers, and importantly, extends to H3K4 writers, notably methyltransferase MLL1. This regulation is not observed on peptide substrates yet occurs on the cis H3 tail, as determined with fully-defined heterotypic nucleosomes. In vivo, H3 tail acetylation is directly and dynamically coupled with cis H3K4 methylation levels. Together, these observations reveal an acetylation  chromatin switch on the H3 tail that modulates read-write accessibility in nucleosomes and resolve the long-standing question of why H3K4me3 levels are coupled with H3 acetylation.",

    "abstract": "In drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy, automated tools for seizure onset zone (SOZ) localization using brief interictal recordings would supplement presurgical evaluations and improve care. Thus, we sought to localize SOZs by training a multi-channel convolutional neural network on stereo-EEG (SEEG) cortico-cortical evoked potentials. We performed single pulse electrical stimulation with 10 drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients implanted with SEEG. Using the 500,000 unique post-stimulation SEEG epochs, we trained a multi-channel one-dimensional convolutional neural network to determine whether an SOZ was stimulated. SOZs were classified with a mean leave-one-patient-out testing sensitivity of 78.1% and specificity of 74.6%. To achieve maximum accuracy, the model requires a 0-350 ms post stimulation time period. Post-hoc analysis revealed that the model accurately classified unilateral vs bilateral mesial temporal lobe seizure onset, and neocortical SOZs. This is the first demonstration, to our knowledge, that a deep learning framework can be used to accurately classify SOZs using cortico-cortical evoked potentials. Our findings suggest accurate classification of SOZs relies on a complex temporal evolution of evoked potentials within 350 ms of stimulation. Validation in a larger dataset could provide a practical clinical tool for the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "There is significant interest in pooling magnetic resonance image (MRI) data from multiple datasets to enable mega-analysis. Harmonization is typically performed to reduce heterogeneity when pooling MRI data across datasets. Most MRI harmonization algorithms do not explicitly consider downstream application performance during harmonization. However, the choice of downstream application might influence what might be considered as study-specific confounds. Therefore, ignoring downstream applications during harmonization might potentially limit downstream performance. Here we propose a goal-specific harmonization framework that utilizes downstream application performance to regularize the harmonization procedure. Our framework can be integrated with a wide variety of harmonization models based on deep neural networks, such as the recently proposed conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE) harmonization model. Three datasets from three different continents with a total of 2787 participants and 10085 anatomical T1 scans were used for evaluation. We found that cVAE removed more dataset differences than the widely used ComBat model, but at the expense of removing desirable biological information as measured by downstream prediction of mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores and clinical diagnoses. On the other hand, our goal-specific cVAE (gcVAE) was able to remove as much dataset differences as cVAE, while improving downstream cross-sectional prediction of MMSE scores and clinical diagnoses.",

Work on Ipomoea hederacea, an annual vine, has found genetic clines in the means of a suite of ecologically important traits, including flowering time, growth rate, seed mass, and corolla width. Here we investigate the genetic (co)variances of these clinally varying traits in two northern range-edge and two central populations of Ipomoea hederacea to evaluate the influence of the genetic architecture on divergence across the range. We find 1) limited evidence for clear differentiation between Northern and Southern populations in the structure of G, suggesting overall stability of G across the range despite mean trait divergence and 2) that the axes of greatest variation (gmax) were unaligned with the axis of greatest multivariate divergence. Together these results indicate the role of the quantitative genetic architecture in constraining evolutionary response and divergence among populations across the geographic range.",

During gastrulation, a transient neural border zone state precedes the choice between neural crest and placodes which includes multiple and converging gene programs. Transcription factor connectome and bifurcation analyses demonstrate the early emergence of neural crest fates at the neural plate stage, alongside an unbiased multipotent lineage persisting until after epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

    "abstract": "The physiology of plant hosts can be dramatically altered by phytopathogens. Xanthomonas hortorum pv. gardneri is one such pathogen that creates an aqueous niche within the leaf apoplast by manipulating the plant via the transcription activator-like effector AvrHah1. Simultaneous immigration of X. gardneri and Salmonella enterica to healthy tomato leaves results in increased survival of S. enterica as Xanthomonas infection progresses. However, the fate of S. enterica following arrival on actively infected leaves has not been examined. We hypothesized that the water-soaking caused by X. gardneri could facilitate the ingression of S. enterica into the apoplast, and that this environment would be conducive for growth. We found that a water-soaked apoplast, abiotically or Xanthomonas-infected, enabled surface S. enterica to passively localize to the protective apoplast and facilitated migration of S. enterica to distal sites within the aqueous apoplast. AvrHah1 contributed to the protection and migration of S. enterica early in X. gardneri infection. Xanthomonas-infected apoplasts facilitated prolonged survival and promoted S. enterica replication compared to healthy apoplasts. Access to an aqueous apoplast in general protects S. enterica from immediate exposure to irradiation whereas, the altered environment created by Xanthomonas infection provides growth-conducive conditions for S. enterica. Overall, we have characterized an ecological relationship in which host infection converts an unreachable niche to a habitable environment.\n\nImportanceBacterial spot disease caused by Xanthomonas species devastates tomato production worldwide. Salmonellosis outbreaks from consumption of raw produce have been linked to the arrival of Salmonella enterica on crop plants in the field via contaminated irrigation water. Considering that Xanthomonas is difficult to eradicate, it is highly likely that S. enterica arrives on leaves pre-colonized by Xanthomonas with infection underway. Our study demonstrates that infection and disease fundamentally alter the leaf, resulting in redistribution and change in abundance of a phyllosphere bacterial member. These findings contribute to our understanding of how S. enterica manages to persist on leaf tissue despite lacking the ability to liberate nutrients from plant cells. More broadly, this study reveals a mechanism by which physiochemical changes to a host environment imposed by a plant pathogen can convert an uninhabitable leaf environment into a hospitable niche for select epiphytic microbes.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that spontaneously active cultured networks of cortical neuron grown planar microelectrode arrays are sensitive to radiofrequency (RF) fields and exhibit an inhibitory response more pronounced as the exposure time and power increase. To better understand the mechanism behind the observed effects, we aimed at identifying similarities and differences between the inhibitory effect of RF fields (continuous wave, 1800 MHz) to the {gamma}-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor agonist muscimol (MU). Inhibition of the network bursting activity in response to RF exposure became apparent at an SAR level of 28.6 W/kg and co-occurred with an elevation of the culture medium temperature of ~1 {degrees}C. Exposure to RF fields preferentially inhibits bursting over spiking activity and exerts fewer constraints on neural network bursting synchrony, differentiating it from a pharmacological inhibition with MU. Network rebound excitation, a phenomenon relying on the intrinsic properties of cortical neurons, was observed following the removal of tonic hyperpolarization after washout of MU but not in response to cessation of RF exposure. This implies that hyperpolarization is not the main driving force mediating the inhibitory effects of RF fields. At the level of single neurons, network inhibition induced by MU and RF fields occurred with reduced action potential (AP) half-width. As changes in AP waveform strongly influence efficacy of synaptic transmission, the narrowing effect on AP seen under RF exposure might contribute to reducing network bursting activity. By pointing only to a partial overlap between the inhibitory hallmarks of these two forms of inhibition, our data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms of the action of RF fields differ from the ones mediated by the activation of GABAA receptors.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTo obtain a formalism for real-time concurrent sequential estimation of neural membrane time constant and input-output (IO) curve with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).\n\nApproachFirst, the neural membrane response and depolarization factor, which leads to motor evoked potentials (MEPs) with TMS are analytically computed and discussed. Then, an integrated model is developed which combines the neural membrane time constant and input-output curve. Identifiability of the proposed integrated model is discussed. A condition is derived, which assures estimation of the proposed integrated model. Finally, sequential parameter estimation (SPE) of the neural membrane time constant and IO curve is described through closed-loop optimal sampling and open-loop uniform sampling TMS. Without loss of generality, this paper focuses on a specific case of commercialized TMS pulse shapes. The proposed formalism and SPE method are directly applicable to other pulse shapes.\n\nMain resultsThe results confirm satisfactory estimation of the membrane time constant and IO curve parameters. By defining a stopping rule based on five times consecutive convergence of the estimation parameters with a tolerances of 0.01, the membrane time constant and IO curve parameters are estimated with 82 TMS pulses with absolute relative estimation errors (AREs) of less than 4% with the optimal sampling SPE method. At this point, the uniform sampling SPE method leads to AREs up to 16%. The uniform sampling method does not satisfy the stopping rule due to the large estimation variations.\n\nSignificanceThis paper provides a tool for real-time closed-loop SPE of the neural time constant and IO curve, which can contribute novel insights in TMS studies. SPE of the membrane time constant enables selective stimulation, which can be used for advanced brain research, precision medicine and personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "With increasing public data, a statistical analysis approach called meta-analysis, which combines transcriptome results obtained from multiple studies, has succeeded in providing novel insights into targeted biological processes. Locusts and aphids are representative of insect groups that exhibit density-dependent plasticity. Although the physiological mechanisms underlying density-dependent polyphenism have been identified in aphids and locusts, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we performed a meta-analysis of public transcriptomes to gain additional insights into the molecular underpinning of density-dependent plasticity. We collected RNA sequencing data of aphids and locusts from public databases and detected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between crowded and isolated conditions. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to reveal the characteristics of the DEGs. DNA replication (GO:0006260), DNA metabolic processes (GO:0006259), and mitotic cell cycle (GO:0000278) were enriched in response to crowded conditions. To date, these processes have scarcely been the focus of research. The importance of the oxidative stress response and neurological system modifications under isolated conditions has been highlighted. These biological processes, clarified by meta-analysis, are thought to play key roles in the regulation of density-dependent plasticity.\n\nSimple SummaryPopulation density can be an environmental cue to induce modification of insect morphology, physiology, and behavior. This phenomenon is called density-dependent plasticity. Aphids and locusts exhibit textbook examples of density-dependent plasticity but there is a lack of integrative understanding for insect density-dependent plasticity. To address this problem, we combined public gene expression data obtained from multiple studies and re-analyzed them (this process is called meta-analysis). The present study provides additional insight into the regulatory mechanisms of density-dependent plasticity, demonstrating the effectiveness of meta-analyses of public transcriptomes.",

    "abstract": "Neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) represents one of the most lethal forms of prostate cancer (PCa) and lacks life-prolonging treatment. The incidence of NEPC is increased due to the widespread use of AR pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) in the treatment of non-metastatic CRPC and hormone-sensitive metastatic tumors. Here, we identified histone lysine demethylase KDM4A as a key player in NEPC progression and an effective therapeutic target. We found that KDM4A mRNA and protein are overexpressed in human and mouse NEPC compared to prostate adenocarcinoma. Knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of KDM4A in NEPC cell lines suppressed cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that KDM4A promotes NEPC progression, in part, through direct transcriptional regulation of MYC. We showed that MYC is hyper-activated in human and mouse NEPC. KDM4A KD led to suppression of MYC signaling. MYC KD or inhibition profoundly suppressed NEPC cell proliferation. Furthermore, a potent pan-KDM4 inhibitor QC6352 significantly reduced NEPC cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, we demonstrated that KDM4A is an important regulator of NEPC progression and targeting KDM4A may potentially be an effective therapeutic strategy for NEPC.\n\nSignificanceNeuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC) is a highly aggressive prostate cancer subtype that is resistant to potent androgen receptor pathway inhibitors (ARPIs) and currently lacks effective therapeutic options. Histone lysine demethylase KDM4A is an important epigenetic regulator of gene expression in development and cancer. In this study, we show that KDM4A is highly expressed in NEPC and is required for NEPC proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, and in vivo growth, which is in part mediated through the regulation of MYC expression. Importantly, we demonstrate that inhibition of KDM4A significantly impairs NEPC growth in preclinical models. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying NEPC progression and offer a rationale for clinical trials with KDM4 inhibitor in NEPC patients.",

    "abstract": "The decision to leave or join a group is important as group size influences many aspects of organisms lives and their fitness. This tendency to socialise with others, sociability, should be influenced by genes carried by focal individuals (direct genetic effects) and by genes in partner individuals (indirect genetic effects), indicating the traits evolution could be slower or faster than expected. However, estimating these genetic parameters is difficult. Here, in a laboratory population of the cockroach Blaptica dubia, I estimate phenotypic parameters for sociability: repeatability (R) and repeatable influence (RI), that indicate whether direct and indirect genetic effects respectively are likely. I also estimate the interaction coefficient ({Psi}), which quantifies how strongly a partners trait influences the phenotype of the focal individual and is key in models for the evolution of interacting phenotypes. Focal individuals were somewhat repeatable for sociability across a three-week period (R = 0.083), and partners also had marginally consistent effects on focal sociability (RI = 0.055). The interaction coefficient was non-zero, although in opposite sign for the sexes; males preferred to associate with larger individuals ({Psi}male = -0.129) while females preferred to associate with smaller individuals ({Psi}female = 0.068). Individual sociability was consistent between dyadic trials and in social networks of groups. These results provide phenotypic evidence that direct and indirect genetic effects have limited influence on sociability, with perhaps most evolutionary potential stemming from heritable effects of the body mass of partners. Sex-specific interaction coefficients may produce sexual conflict and the evolution of sexual dimorphism in social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in method development for multiple sequence alignment over the last several decades, the alignment of datasets exhibiting substantial sequence length heterogeneity, especially when the input sequences include very short sequences (either as a result of sequencing technologies or of large deletions during evolution) remains an inadequately solved problem. We present HMMerge, a method to compute an alignment of datasets exhibiting high sequence length heterogeneity, or to add short sequences into a given \"backbone\" alignment. HMMerge builds on the technique from its predecessor alignment methods, UPP and WITCH, which build an ensemble of HMMs for the backbone alignment and add the remaining sequences into the backbone alignment using the ensemble. HMMerge differs from UPP and WITCH by building a new HMM for each query sequence: it uses a novel ensemble approach to combine the HMMs, each weighted by the probability of generating the query sequence, into a single HMM. Then it applies the Viterbi algorithm to add the query sequence into the backbone alignment. We show that using this \"merged\" HMM provides better accuracy than the current approach in UPP and matches or improves on WITCH for adding short sequences into backbone alignments.

    "abstract": "Cell-generated forces play a major role in coordinating the large-scale behavior of cell assemblies, in particular during development, wound healing and cancer. Mechanical signals propagate faster than biochemical signals, but can have similar effects, especially in epithelial tissues with strong cell-cell adhesion. However, a quantitative description of the transmission chain from force generation in a sender cell, force propagation across cell-cell boundaries, and the concomitant response of receiver cells is missing. For a quantitative analysis of this important situation, here we propose a minimal model system of two epithelial cells on an H-pattern (\"cell doublet\"). After optogenetically activating RhoA, a major regulator of cell contractility, in the sender cell, we measure the mechanical response of the receiver cell by traction force and monolayer stress microscopies. In general, we find that the receiver cells shows an active response so that the cell doublet forms a coherent unit. However, force propagation and response of the receiver cell also strongly depends on the mechano-structural polarization in the cell assembly, which is controlled by cell-matrix adhesion to the adhesive micropattern. We find that the response of the receiver cell is stronger when the mechano-structural polarization axis is oriented perpendicular to the direction of force propagation, reminiscent of the Poisson effect in passive materials. We finally show that the same effects are at work in small tissues. Our work demonstrates that cellular organization and active mechanical response of a tissue is key to maintain signal strength and leads to the emergence of elasticity, which means that signals are not dissipated like in a viscous system, but can propagate over large distances.",

    "abstract": "Establishment of the hemochorial uterine-placental interface requires exodus of trophoblast cells from the placenta and their transformative actions on the uterus, which represent processes critical for a successful pregnancy, but are poorly understood. We examined the involvement of CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxyl terminal domain 2 (CITED2) in rat and human trophoblast cell development. The rat and human exhibit deep hemochorial placentation. CITED2 was distinctively expressed in the junctional zone and invasive trophoblast cells of the rat. Homozygous Cited2 gene deletion resulted in placental and fetal growth restriction. Small Cited2 null placentas were characterized by disruptions in the junctional zone, delays in intrauterine trophoblast cell invasion, and compromised plasticity. In the human placentation site, CITED2 was uniquely expressed in the extravillous trophoblast (EVT) cell column and importantly contributed to development of the EVT cell lineage. We conclude that CITED2 is a conserved regulator of deep hemochorial placentation.\n\nSignificance StatementThe process of establishing the uterine-placental interface is a poorly understood tissue re-engineering event that involves genetically foreign trophoblast cells breaching the immunologically secure uterus. When optimal, mother and fetus thrive, whereas failures represent the root cause of life-threatening diseases of pregnancy. CBP/p300-interacting transactivator with glutamic acid/aspartic acid-rich carboxyl terminal domain 2 (CITED2) is a transcriptional co-regulator with a conspicuous presence in trophoblast cell lineages infiltrating the uterine parenchyma. CITED2 helps coordinate the differentiation of rat and human trophoblast cells into invasive/extravillous trophoblast cells capable of transforming the uterus. These actions ensure requisite placental development and adaptations to physiological stressors. CITED2 exemplifies a conserved regulator of transcriptional events essential for establishing the uterine-placental interface.",

    "abstract": "[~]90% metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (mPDAC) occurs in the liver, and the 5-year survival rate for patients with mPDAC is only at 3%. We previously reported that liver endothelial cells (ECs) secreted soluble factors to promote colorectal cancer cell survival in a paracrine fashion. However, the effects of liver ECs on mPDAC have not been elucidated. In this study, we used primary ECs from non-neoplastic liver tissues. We treated PDAC cells with conditioned medium (CM) from liver ECs, with CM from PDAC as controls, and determined that liver EC-secreted factors increased PDAC cell growth. Using an unbiased receptor tyrosine kinase array, we identified human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3, also known as ErbB3) as a key mediator in EC-induced growth in PDAC cells that have HER3 expression (HER3 +ve). We found that EC-secreted neuregulins activated the HER3-AKT signaling axis, and that depleting neuregulins from EC CM or blocking HER3 with an antibody, seribantumab, attenuated EC-induced proliferation in HER3 +ve PDAC cells, but not in cells without HER3 expression. Furthermore, we determined that EC CM increased PDAC xenograft growth in vivo, and that seribantumab blocked EC-induced growth in xenografts with HER3 expression. These findings elucidated a paracrine role of liver ECs in promoting PDAC cell growth, and identified the HER3-AKT axis as a key mediator in EC-induced functions in PDAC cells with HER3 expression.\n\nImplicationsover 70% mPDAC express HER3.

    "abstract": "The nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) is a key subcortical structure that is important in arousal, cognition, brain network modulation, and has been explored as a deep brain stimulation target. It has also been implicated in several disease states, including Alzheimers disease, Parkinsons disease, and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Given the small size of NBM and variability between patients, NBM is difficult to study; thus, accurate, patient-specific segmentation is needed. We investigated whether a deep learning network could produce accurate, patient-specific segmentations of NBM on commonly utilized 3T MRI. It is difficult to accurately segment NBM on 3T MRI, with 7T being preferred. Paired 3T and 7T MRI datasets of 21 healthy subjects were obtained, with 6 completely withheld for testing. NBM was expertly segmented on 7T MRI, providing accurate labels for the paired 3T MRI. An external dataset of 14 patients with TLE was used to test the model on brains with neurological disorders. A 3D-Unet convolutional neural network was constructed, and a 5-fold cross-validation was performed. The model was evaluated on healthy subjects using the held-out test dataset and the external dataset of TLE patients. The model demonstrated significantly improved dice coefficient over the standard probabilistic atlas for both healthy subjects (0.68MEAN{+/-}0.08SD vs. 0.47{+/-}0.06, p=0.0089, t-test) and TLE patients (0.63{+/-}0.08 vs. 0.38{+/-}0.19, p=0.0001). Additionally, the centroid distance was significantly decreased when using the model in patients with TLE (1.22{+/-}0.33mm, 3.25{+/-}2.57mm, p=0.0110). We developed the first model, to our knowledge, for automatic and accurate patient-specific segmentation of the NBM.",

However, what constitutes an effective dose in tACS applications is still a matter of investigation and debate. Here, we examined available literature data regarding the effects of alternating current (AC)-induced electric fields on cellular-level neural activity. The literature search identified 16 relevant experimental reports that utilized brain slices, anesthetized rodents, and awake/behaving animal models. We implemented a probabilistic meta-analysis to estimate the minimum effective dose (MED) required for inducing detectable significant neural changes with AC stimulation. The results showed that AC stimulation at 0.3 mV/mm in awake/behaving mammals leads to an 80% probability of inducing minimum neural effects. A similar level of effectiveness in brain slices and anesthetized mammals required 0.7 mV/mm. In conclusion, (transcranial) alternating current stimulation is significantly more effective in awake than in anesthetized brains. The proposed dose targets can serve as a practical guideline for tACS in humans.",

Two-photon calcium imaging of somal activity in CA1 neuron populations was done in head fixed mice. Sensory stimuli, either a light flash or an air stream, were delivered to the mice when at rest, when moving spontaneously, and while they were induced to run a fixed distance on the conveyor belt. Overall, 99% of 2083 identified cells (from 5 mice) were active across one or more of 20 sensorimotor events. A larger proportion of cells were active during locomotion. Nevertheless, for any given sensorimotor event, only about 17% of cells were active. When considering pairs of sensorimotor event types, the active cell population consisted of conjunctive (C [isin] A and B) cells, active across both events, and complementary (C [isin] A not B or C [isin] B not A) cells that were active only during individual events. Whereas conjunctive cells characterised stable representations of repeated sensorimotor events, complementary cells characterised recruitment of new cells for encoding novel sensorimotor events. The moment-to-moment recruitment of conjunctive and complementary cells across changing sensorimotor events signifies the involvement of the hippocampus in functional networks integrating sensory information with ongoing movement. This role of the hippocampus is well suited for movement guidance that secondarily might include spatial behavior, episodic learning and memory, context representation, and scene construction.",

Sharing these workflows provides researchers easy access to high-quality analysis methods without the requirement of computational expertise. However, published workflows are not always guaranteed to be reliably reusable. Therefore, a system is needed to lower the cost of sharing workflows in a reusable form.\n\nResultsWe introduce Yevis, a system to build a workflow registry that automatically validates and tests workflows to be published. The validation and test are based on the requirements we defined for a workflow being reusable with confidence. Yevis runs on GitHub and Zenodo and allows workflow hosting without the need of dedicated computing resources. A Yevis registry accepts workflow registration via a GitHub pull request, followed by an automatic validation and test process for the submitted workflow. As a proof of concept, we built a registry using Yevis to host workflows from a community to demonstrate how a workflow can be shared while fulfilling the defined requirements.\n\nConclusionsYevis helps in the building of a workflow registry to share reusable workflows without requiring extensive human resources. By following Yeviss workflow-sharing procedure, one can operate a registry while satisfying the reusable work-flow criteria. This system is particularly useful to individuals or communities that want to share workflows but lacks the specific technical expertise to build and maintain a workflow registry from scratch.",

The model is a \"Swiss Army Knife\" capable of sequence-structure co-design, sequence design for given backbone structures, and antibody optimization.

How can the visual system reliably extract local features from an input dominated by self-generated signals? In Drosophila, diverse local visual features are represented by a group of projection neurons with distinct tuning properties. Here we describe a connectome-based volumetric imaging strategy to measure visually evoked neural activity across this population. We show that local visual features are jointly represented across the population, and that a shared gain factor improves trial-to-trial coding fidelity. A subset of these neurons, tuned to small objects, is modulated by two independent signals associated with self-movement, a motor-related signal and a visual motion signal. These two inputs adjust the sensitivity of these feature detectors across the locomotor cycle, selectively reducing their gain during saccades and restoring it during intersaccadic intervals.

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in cognitive, computational and clinical neuroscience. The reliable and efficient application of ML requires a sound understanding of its subtleties and limitations. Training ML models on datasets with imbalanced classes is a particularly common problem, and it can have severe consequences if not adequately addressed. With the neuroscience ML user in mind, this paper provides a didactic assessment of the class imbalance problem and illustrates its impact through systematic manipulation of data imbalance ratios in (i) simulated data and (ii) brain data recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our results illustrate how the widely-used Accuracy (Acc) metric, which measures the overall proportion of successful predictions, yields misleadingly high performances, as class imbalance increases. Because Acc weights the per-class ratios of correct predictions proportionally to class size, it largely disregards the performance on the minority class. A binary classification model that learns to systematically vote for the majority class will yield an artificially high decoding accuracy that directly reflects the imbalance between the two classes, rather than any genuine generalizable ability to discriminate between them. We show that other evaluation metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and the less common Balanced Accuracy (BAcc) metric - defined as the arithmetic mean between sensitivity and specificity, provide more reliable performance evaluations for imbalanced data. Our findings also highlight the robustness of Random Forest (RF), and the benefits of using stratified cross-validation and hyperprameter optimization to tackle data imbalance. Critically, for neuroscience ML applications that seek to minimize overall classification error, we recommend the routine use of BAcc, which in the specific case of balanced data is equivalent to using standard Acc, and readily extends to multi-class settings. Importantly, we present a list of recommendations for dealing with imbalanced data, as well as open-source code to allow the neuroscience community to replicate and extend our observations and explore alternative approaches to coping with imbalanced data.",

    "abstract": "Superficial white matter (SWM) represents a significantly understudied part of the human brain, despite comprising a large portion of brain volume and making up a majority of cortical structural connections. Using multiple, high-quality, datasets with large sample sizes (N=2421, age range 5-100) in combination with methodological advances in tractography, we quantified features of SWM volume and thickness across the brain and across the lifespan. We address four questions: (1) How does U-fiber volume change with age? (2) What does U-fiber thickness look like across the brain? (3) How does SWM thickness change with age? (4) Are there relationships between SWM thickness and cortical features? Our main findings are that (1) SWM volume shows unique volumetric trajectories with age that are distinct from gray matter and other white matter trajectories; (2) SWM thickness varies across the brain, with patterns robust across individuals and across the population at the region-level and vertex-level; (3) SWM shows nonlinear changes across the lifespan that vary across regions; and (4) SWM thickness is associated with cortical thickness and curvature. For the first time, we show that SWM volume follows a similar trend as overall white matter volume, peaking at a similar time in adolescence, leveling off throughout adulthood, and decreasing with age thereafter. Notably, the relative fraction of total brain volume of SWM continuously increases with age, and consequently takes up a larger proportion of total white matter volume, unlike the other tissue types that decrease with respect to total brain volume. This study represents the first characterization of SWM features across the lifespan and provides the background for characterizing normal aging and insight into the mechanisms associated with SWM development and decline.",

    "abstract": "In zebrafish telencephalon, radial glial cells (RGs) show a remarkable ability to regenerate damaged neural tissue by re-initiating cell proliferation to produce neural precursors to rebuild the lost neural circuit. However, it is not fully understood how RGs respond to brain damage to initiate this regenerative response. Here we applied single-cell transcriptomics to RGs in adult zebrafish telencephalon and identified five RG subtypes, which are classified into four quiescent RGs (qRGs) and one proliferating RG (pRG). The four qRGs differentially express distinct subsets of qRG markers, suggesting heterogeneity of qRG in zebrafish adult brain. Interestingly, one qRG subtype shows high expression of ribosomal proteins, and its fraction increases in response to brain damage. Consistently, the mTOR pathway is activated in RGs near the injury site. It was reported that inflammatory responses of brain-resident immune cells, microglia, are required for inducing regenerative responses of RGs in zebrafish. Genetical elimination of microglia not only suppressed the damage-induced regenerative response of RGs, but also decreased the fraction of the ribosomal expression-enriched qRGs. Our pseudo-time analysis suggests that putative dormant RGs produce ribosomal expression-enriched qRGs through activation of ribosomal genesis, as well as suppression of cholesterol biogenesis, and pRGs through activation of the JAK/STAT pathway. Our findings reveal heterogeneity of qRGs in adult zebrafish brain and their dynamic regenerative response to brain damage.",

    "abstract": "Chronic infection by gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients in whom overabundant mucus and the formation of bacterial biofilms pose barriers to drug delivery and effectiveness. Accurate pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) models of biofilm treatment could be used to guide formulation and administration strategies to better control bacterial lung infections. To this end, we have developed a detailed pharmacodynamic model of P. aeruginosa treatment with the front-line antibiotics, tobramycin and colistin, and validated it on a detailed dataset of killing dynamics. A compartmental model structure was developed in which the key features are diffusion of drug through a boundary layer to the bacteria, concentration dependent interactions with bacteria, and passage of the bacteria through successive transit states before death. The number of transit states employed was greater for tobramycin, which is a ribosomal inhibitor, than for colistin, which disrupts bacterial membranes. For both drugs, the experimentally observed delay in killing of bacteria following drug exposure was replicated and was consistent with the diffusion time, though for tobramycin, there was an additional delay reflected in the model by passage through the transit states. For each drug, the PD model with a single set of parameters described data across a ten-fold range of concentrations and for both continuous and transient exposure protocols. Furthermore, the parameters fit for each drug individually were used to model the response of biofilms to combined treatment with tobramycin and colistin. The ability to predict drug response over a range of administration protocols allows this PD model to be integrated with PK descriptions to describe in vivo antibiotic response dynamics and to predict drug delivery strategies for improved control of bacterial lung infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryBiofilms are self-assembling bacterial communities that adhere to a surface and encase themselves in a protective coating. Biofilm infections are notoriously difficult to treat with conventional antibiotic administrations. To understand better the dynamics of bacterial biofilm killing in response to antibiotic treatment, we developed a mathematical model that integrates several features: drug diffusion through a boundary layer that includes the biofilm casing, concentration dependent cell damage, and passage of the cell through damaged states to eventual death. We validated the model by comparison with an extensive published dataset of biofilm response to treatment with the antibiotics, tobramycin and colistin. The model fits to these datasets were able to capture the observed trends for several antibiotic administration protocols, with model parameters reflecting the differences in mechanism of action between the two drugs. This validated model can be integrated with pharmacokinetic descriptions of drug distribution in the body over time to predict dosing and administration protocols for preclinical and clinical studies.",

    "abstract": "Dopamine release in the ventral striatum is fundamental to adaptive appetitive behavior. Frustratingly, technological, and methodological hurdles have limited the investigation of the mechanisms that drive phasic dopamine release. Although dopamine neuron activation in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) surely results in dopamine release, how populations of these neurons coordinate their activities in time to modulate the temporal pattern of release remains unclear. Additionally, burgeoning evidence suggests that control over striatal dopamine release is not solely regulated by the burst firing of VTA neurons or even cell-body activation of these neurons. Here, we recorded VTA neurons while simultaneously monitoring pharmacologically induced phasic dopamine release events in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens core) of anesthetized rats. On average, dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons increased activity at the time of the onset of release and decreased at the time of peak release; however, the tuning of individual VTA neurons to dopamine release was notably heterogenous, with subsets of neurons responding prior to release, at release onset, or during release. Other neurons were notably silent during release but active otherwise. Interestingly, both putative dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic neurons expressed this temporally heterogeneous response pattern. Furthermore, the firing activity of dopaminergic, but not non-dopaminergic neurons, correlated with the magnitude of dopamine release. These data suggest that populations of VTA neurons become active at distinct times of a dopamine release event to sculpt the temporal pattern of release.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox has emerged as a fast-spreading disease around the world and an outbreak has been reported in 75 countries so far. Although the clinical attributes of Monkeypox are similar to those of Smallpox, skin lesions and rashes caused by Monkeypox often resemble those of other types of pox, for example, chickenpox and cowpox. This scenario makes an early diagnosis of Monkeypox challenging for the healthcare professional just by observing the visual appearance of lesions and rashes. The rarity of Monkeypox before the current outbreak further created a knowledge gap among healthcare professionals around the world. To tackle this challenging situation, scientists are taking motivation from the success of supervised machine learning in COVID-19 detection. However, the lack of Monkeypox skin image data is making the bottleneck of using machine learning in Monkeypox detection from patient skin images. Therefore, in this project, we introduce the Monkeypox Skin Image Dataset 2022, the largest of its kind so far. We used web-scraping to collect Monkeypox, Chickenpox, Smallpox, Cowpox, and Measles infected skin as well as healthy skin images to build a comprehensive image database and make it publicly available. We believe that our database will facilitate the development of baseline machine learning algorithms for early detection of Monkeypox in clinical settings.

    "abstract": "Human movement is accomplished through muscle contraction, yet there does not exist a portable system capable of monitoring muscle length changes in real time. To address this limitation, we previously introduced magnetomicrometry, a minimally-invasive tracking technique comprising two implanted magnetic beads in muscle and a magnetic field sensor array positioned on the bodys surface adjacent the implanted beads. The implant system comprises a pair of spherical magnetic beads, each with a first coating of nickel-copper-nickel and an outer coating of Parylene C. In parallel work, we demonstrate submillimeter accuracy of magnetic bead tracking for muscle contractions in an untethered freely-roaming avian model. Here, we address the clinical viability of magnetomicrometry. Using a specialized device to insert magnetic beads into muscle in avian and lagomorph models, we collect data to assess gait metrics, bead migration, and bead biocompatibility. For these animal models, we find no gait differences post- versus pre-implantation, and bead migration towards one another within muscle does not occur for initial bead separation distances greater than 3 cm. Further, using extensive biocompatibility testing, the implants are shown to be non-irritant, non-cytotoxic, non-allergenic, and non-irritating. Our cumulative results lend support for the viability of these magnetic bead implants for implantation in human muscle. We thus anticipate their imminent use in human-machine interfaces, such as in control of prostheses, exoskeletons, and in closed-loop neuroprosthetics to aid recovery from neurological disorders.",

However, it is unclear how such information reaches the hippocampus. In the current experiment, we tested the hypothesis that the stimulus control exerted by distal visual landmarks requires input from the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). Place cells were recorded from mice with ibotenic acid lesions of the MEC (n = 7) and from sham-lesioned mice (n = 6) following 90{degrees} rotations of either distal landmarks or proximal cues in a cue controlled environment. We found that lesions of the MEC impaired the anchoring of place fields to distal landmarks, but not proximal cues. We also observed that, relative to sham-lesioned mice, place cells in animals with MEC lesions exhibited significantly reduced spatial information and increased sparsity. These results support the view that distal landmark information reaches the hippocampus via the MEC, but that proximal cue information can do so via an alternative neural pathway.",

    "abstract": "Ionotropic glutamate receptors are ligand-gated cation channels that play essential roles in the excitatory synaptic transmission throughout the central nervous system. A number of open-pore structures of -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic-acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptors became recently available by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). These structures provide valuable insights into the conformation of the selectivity filter (SF), the part of the ion channel that determines the ion selectivity. Nonetheless, due to the moderate resolution of the cryo-EM structures, detailed information such as ion occupancy of monovalent and divalent cations as well as exact displacement of the side-chains in the SF is still missing. Here, in order to resolve high-resolution crystal structures of the AMPA SF in its open-state, we incorporated the partial SF sequence of the AMPA receptor into the bacterial tetrameric cation channel NaK, which served as a structural scaffold. We determined a series of X-ray structures of NaK-CDI, NaK-SDI and NaK-SELM mutants at 1.42-2.10 [A] resolution, showing distinct ion occupation of different monovalent cations. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of NaK-CDI indicated the channel to be conductive to monovalent cations, which agrees well with our electrophysiology recordings. Moreover, unique structural asymmetry of the SF was revealed by the X-ray structures and MD simulations, implying its importance in ion non-selectivity of tetrameric cation channels.",

The UNC-45 chaperone controls myosin function mediating the folding, assembly, and degradation of the muscle protein. Here, we analyze the molecular mechanism of UNC-45 as a hub in myosin quality control. We show that UNC-45 forms discrete complexes with folded and unfolded myosin, forwarding them to downstream chaperones and E3 ligases. Structural analysis of a minimal chaperone:substrate complex reveals that UNC-45 binds to a conserved FX3HY motif in the myosin motor domain. Disrupting the observed interface by mutagenesis prevents myosin maturation leading to protein aggregation in vivo. We also show that a mutation in the FX3HY motif linked to the Freeman Sheldon Syndrome impairs UNC-45 assisted folding, reducing the level of functional myosin.

    "abstract": "During the development of the mammalian brain, neocortical structures are formed by the sequential radial migration of newborn excitatory neurons. The early migrating neurons exhibit a multipolar shape, but they undergo a multipolar-to-bipolar transition at the subplate (SP) layer, where extracellular matrix (ECM) components are abundantly expressed. In this study, we revealed that the TGF-{beta} signaling-related ECM proteins, such as latent TGF-{beta}-binding protein 1 (LTBP1) and fibrillin 2, and TGF-{beta} receptor II (TGF-{beta}RII) and its downstream effector, p-smad2/3, are selectively expressed at the SP layer, suggesting that TGF-{beta} is sequestered in a latent form by forming complexes with these ECM components and then its signaling is activated by ECM remodeling. We found that the migrating multipolar neurons transiently express a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 2 (ADAMTS2), an ECM metalloproteinase, just below the SP layer. Knockdown and knockout of Adamts2 suppressed the multipolar-to-bipolar transition of migrating neurons, and therefore, disturbed radial migration. Similar phenotypes were observed by the perturbation of TGF-{beta} signaling in the migrating neurons. Time-lapse luminescence imaging of TGF-{beta} signaling indicated that ADAMTS2 activates this signaling pathway in the migrating neurons during the multipolar-to-bipolar transition at the SP layer. These results suggest that the ADAMTS2 secreted by the migrating multipolar neurons activates TGF-{beta} signaling by ECM remodeling of the SP layer, leading to the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. We propose that the SP layer plays an essential role in the radial neuronal migration as a signaling center of the developing neocortex.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe neocortex is formed by the sequential radial migration of newborn neurons, which undergo a multipolar-to-bipolar transition at the subplate (SP) layer. The extracellular matrix (ECM) is abundantly expressed in the SP layer. However, the roles of the ECM in the SP layer have been unclear. We found that migrating neurons transiently express a disintegrin and a metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motif 2 (ADAMTS2), an ECM metalloproteinase, just below the SP layer. We show that ADAMTS2 secreted by multipolar migrating neurons activates TGF-{beta} signaling through remodeling of the ECM in the SP layer, leading to the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Thus, the SP layer plays an essential role in radial migration as a signaling center of the developing neocortex",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a lysosomal degradative pathway important for neuronal development, function, and survival. But how autophagy in axons is regulated by neurotrophins to impact neuronal viability and function is poorly understood. Here, we investigate the regulation of axonal autophagy by the neurotrophin BDNF, and elucidate whether autophagosomes carry BDNF-mediated signaling information. We find that BDNF induces autophagic flux in primary neurons by stimulating the retrograde pathway for autophagy in axons. We observed an increase in autophagosome density and retrograde flux in axons, and a corresponding increase in autophagosome density in the soma. However, we find little evidence of autophagosomes co-migrating with BDNF. In contrast, BDNF effectively engages its cognate receptor TrkB to undergo retrograde transport in the axon. These compartments, however, are distinct from LC3-positive autophagic organelles in the axon. Together, we find that BDNF stimulates autophagy in the axon, but retrograde autophagosomes do not appear to carry neurotrophin-based signaling information. Thus, BDNF likely stimulates autophagy as a consequence of BDNF-induced processes that require canonical roles for autophagy in degradation, rather than unconventional roles in neurotrophin signaling.",

    "abstract": "The ability to use information from ones prior actions is necessary for decision-making. While Orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been hypothesized as key for inferences made using cue and value-related information, whether OFC populations contribute to the use of information from volitional actions to guide behavior is not clear. Here, we used a self-paced lever-press hold down task in which mice infer prior lever press durations to guide subsequent action performance. We show that activity of genetically identified lateral OFC subpopulations differentially instantiate current and prior action information during ongoing action execution. Transient state-dependent lOFC circuit disruptions of specified subpopulations reduced the encoding of ongoing press durations but did not disrupt the use of prior action information to guide future action performance. In contrast, a chronic functional loss of lOFC circuit activity resulted in increased reliance on recently executed lever press durations and impaired contingency reversal, suggesting the recruitment of compensatory mechanisms that resulted in repetitive action control. Our results identify a novel role for lOFC in the integration of action information to guide adaptive behavior.",

    "abstract": "Host protein HuR translocation from nucleus to cytoplasm following infection is crucial for the life cycle of several RNA viruses including hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major causative agent of hepatocellular carcinoma. HuR assists the assembly of replication-complex on the viral-3'UTR, and its depletion hampers viral replication. Although cytoplasmic HuR is crucial for HCV replication, little is known about how the virus orchestrates the mobilization of HuR into the cytoplasm from the nucleus. We show that two viral proteins, NS3 and NS5A, act co-ordinately to alter the equilibrium of the nucleo-cytoplasmic movement of HuR. NS3 activates protein kinase C (PKC)-{delta}, which in-turn phosphorylates HuR on S318 residue, triggering its export to the cytoplasm. NS5A inactivates AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) resulting in diminished nuclear import of HuR through blockade of AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and acetylation of importin-1. Cytoplasmic retention or entry of HuR can be reversed by an AMPK activator or a PKC-{delta} inhibitor. Our findings suggest that efforts should be made to develop inhibitors of PKC-{delta} and AMPK, either separately or in combination, to inhibit HCV infection.\n\nAuthor summaryHepatitis C virus is a major human pathogen, which exploits cellular machinery for its propagation in liver cells. The cytoplasmic availability of cellular components is crucial for their direct influence on processes involving the viral RNA, which lacks any nuclear history. Our results establish the involvement of viral proteins, NS3 and NS5A in achieving increased cytoplasmic abundance of a host factor HuR, an RNA binding protein (RBP) critical for HCV replication. This is achieved via direct post-translational modification of HuR and indirect regulation of its nuclear carrier by coercing two host kinases, PKC-{delta} and AMPK-. RBPs are emerging as novel targetable candidates for gene regulation. Similar studies with other RBPs and targeting protein modifications, in place of whole protein knockdown, could usher in a revolutionary strategy to neutralize emerging RNA virus-based diseases, while preserving their cellular functions.",

    "abstract": "Septins are cytoskeletal proteins that participate in cell adhesion, migration and polarity establishment. The septin subunit SEPT9 directly interacts with the single LIM domain of EPLIN, an actin bundling protein. Using a human SEPT9 KO fibroblast cell line we show that cell adhesion and migration are regulated by the interplay between both proteins. The low motility of SEPT9-depleted cells could be partly rescued by increased levels of EPLIN. The normal organization of actin-related filopodia and stress fibers was directly dependent on the expression level of SEPT9 and EPLIN. Increased levels of SEPT9 and EPLIN enhanced the size of focal adhesions in cell protrusions, correlating with a stabilization of actin bundles, whereas decreased levels have the opposite effect. Our work thus establishes the interaction between SEPT9 and Eplin as important link between the septin and the actin cytoskeleton that influences cell adhesion and motility.",

    "abstract": "Transient lysosomal damage after infection with cytosolic pathogens or silica crystals uptake results in protease leakage. Whether limited leakage of lysosomal contents into the cytosol affects the function of cytoplasmic organelles is unknown. Here, we show that sterile and non-sterile lysosomal damage triggers a cell death independent proteolytic remodelling of the mitochondrial proteome in macrophages. Mitochondrial metabolic reprogramming required lysosomal leakage of Cathepsin B and Cathepsin L and was independent of proteasome degradation and mitophagy. In a mouse model of endomembrane damage, metabolic analysis confirmed that in vivo, live lung macrophages that internalised crystals displayed impaired mitochondrial function and increased glycolytic and lipid metabolism. Single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage revealed that lysosomal damage skewed metabolic and immune responses primarily in CD36+/LIPA+ and Krt79+/Car4+ subsets of alveolar macrophages. Importantly, modulation of macrophage metabolism with 2-Deoxy- d- glucose and oxamate impacted the host response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection in an endomembrane damage dependent manner. This work uncovers a new inter-organelle communication pathway, providing a general mechanism by which macrophages undergo mitochondrial metabolic reprograming after endomembrane damage.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDEpsin endocytic adaptor proteins are implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been fully defined. In this study, we determined how epsins enhance endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT) in atherosclerosis and assessed the efficacy of a therapeutic peptide in a preclinical model of this disease.\n\nMETHODSUsing single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), combined with molecular, cellular, and biochemical analyses, we investigated the role of epsins in stimulating EndoMT using knock-out mouse models. The therapeutic efficacy of a synthetic peptide targeting atherosclerotic plaques was then assessed in Apoe-/- mice.\n\nRESULTSScRNA-seq and lineage tracing revealed that epsins 1 and 2 promote EndoMT, and the loss of endothelial epsins inhibits EndoMT marker expression as well as transforming growth factor-beta signaling in vitro and in atherosclerotic mice, which is associated with smaller lesions in Apoe-/- mouse model. Mechanistically, the loss of endothelial cell epsins results in increased fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) expression that inhibits TGF-{beta} signaling and EndoMT. Epsins directly bind ubiquitinated FGFR1 through their ubiquitin-interacting motif (UIM), which results in endocytosis and degradation of this receptor complex. Consequently, administration of a synthetic UIM-containing peptide API significantly attenuates EndoMT and progression of atherosclerosis.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWe conclude that epsins potentiate EndoMT during atherogenesis by increasing TGF-{beta} signaling through FGFR1 internalization and degradation. Inhibition of EndoMT by reducing epsin-FGFR1 interaction with a therapeutic peptide may represent a novel treatment strategy for atherosclerosis.",

Epsins, a family of endocytic adaptors, fuel the progression of atherosclerosis; however, the underlying mechanism and therapeutic potential of targeting Epsins remains unknown.

We then developed an innovative method to therapeutically-target macrophage Epsins with specially-designed S2P-conjugated lipid nanoparticles (NPs), which encapsulate small interfering RNAs to suppress Epsins.\n\nMETHODSWe used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with our newly developed algorithm MEBOCOST to study cell-cell communications mediated by metabolites from sender cells and sensor proteins on receiver cells. Biomedical, cellular and molecular approaches were utilized to investigate the role of macrophage Epsins in regulating lipid metabolism and transport. We performed this study using myeloid-specific Epsin double knockout (LysM-DKO) mice and mice with a genetic reduction of ABCG1 (LysM-DKO-ABCG1fl/+). The NPs targeting lesional macrophages were developed to encapsulate interfering RNAs to treat atherosclerosis.\n\nRESULTSWe revealed that Epsins regulate lipid metabolism and transport in atherosclerotic macrophages. Inhibiting Epsins by nanotherapy halts inflammation and accelerates atheroma resolution. Harnessing lesional macrophage-specific NP delivery of Epsin siRNAs, we showed that silencing of macrophage Epsins markedly diminished atherosclerotic plaque size and promoted plaque regression.

Conversely, Epsins promoted ABCG1 degradation via lysosomes and hampered ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport. In a LysM-DKO-ABCG1fl/+ mouse model, enhanced cholesterol efflux and reverse transport due to Epsin deficiency was suppressed by the reduction of ABCG1.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur findings suggest that targeting Epsins in lesional macrophages may offer therapeutic benefits for advanced atherosclerosis by reducing CD36-mediated lipid uptake and increasing ABCG1-mediated cholesterol efflux.\n\nNovelty and SignificanceO_ST_ABSWHAT IS KNOWN?C_ST_ABSO_LIEpsin endocytic adaptor proteins are upregulated in human and mouse atherosclerotic lesions\nC_LIO_LILesional macrophages internalize lipids primarily through scavenger receptor-mediated endocytosis such as CD36 and SR-A\nC_LIO_LIMacrophage-mediated cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport is crucial to atheroma resolution\nC_LI\n\nWHAT NEW INFORMATION DOES THIS ARTICLE CONTRIBUTE?O_LIScRNA-seq combined with the newly-developed algorithm MEBOCOST reveals that Epsins are involved in macrophage-mediated lipid metabolic regulation\nC_LIO_LIMacrophage epsins promote lipid uptake by targeting CD36 endocytosis and membrane recycling via the Epsin ENTH domain\nC_LIO_LIEpsins bind ubiquitinated ABCG1--resulting in the endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of this cholesterol transporter, which reduces cholesterol efflux.\nC_LIO_LIMacrophage-specific, nanoparticle-mediated RNAi delivery exhibits a therapeutic benefit for the treatment of atherosclerosis\nC_LIO_LIAtherosclerotic plaque regression using this nanoparticle delivery platform represents a clinically-relevant approach for the treatment of advance atherosclerosis\nC_LI\n\nBRIEF SUMMARYDespite the development of new cholesterol-lowering therapies, including the recently approved PCSK9 small interfering RNA (siRNA) antagonists, patients still face a tremendous risk of developing major acute cardiovascular events resulting from chronic inflammation in the plaque.

    "abstract": "Sequence changes in viral genomes generate protein sequence diversity that enable viruses to evade the host immune system, hindering the development of effective preventive and therapeutic interventions. Massive proliferation of sequence data provides unprecedented opportunities to study viral adaptation and evolution. Alignment-free approach removes various restrictions, otherwise posed by an alignment-dependent approach for the study of sequence diversity. The publicly available tool, UNIQmin offers an alignment-free approach for the study of viral sequence diversity at any given rank of taxonomy lineage and is big data ready. The tool performs an exhaustive search to determine the minimal set of sequences required to capture the peptidome diversity within a given dataset. This compression is possible through the removal of identical sequences and unique sequences that do not contribute effectively to the peptidome diversity pool. Herein, we describe a detailed three-part protocol utilizing UNIQmin to generate the minimal set for the purpose of viral diversity analyses, alignment-free at any rank of the taxonomy lineage, using the latest global public health threat monkeypox virus (MPX) as a case study. This protocol enables systematic diversity study across the taxonomic lineage, which are much needed for our future preparedness of a viral epidemic, in particular when data is in abundance, freely available, and alignment is not an option.",

    "abstract": "Remdesivir is an antiviral drug used for COVID-19 treatment worldwide. Cardiovascular (CV) side effects have been associated with remdesivir; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we performed a large-scale G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) screening in combination with structural modeling and found that remdesivir is a selective agonist for urotensin-II receptor (UTS2R). Functionally, remdesivir treatment induced prolonged field potential in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS)-derived cardiomyocytes and reduced contractility in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, both of which mirror the clinical pathology. Importantly, remdesivir-mediated cardiac malfunctions were effectively attenuated by antagonizing UTS2R signaling. Finally, we characterized the effect of 110 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in UTS2R gene reported in genome database and found four missense variants that show gain-of-function effects in the receptor sensitivity to remdesivir. Collectively, our study illuminates a previously unknown mechanism underlying remdesivir-related CV events and that genetic variations of UTS2R gene can be a potential risk factor for CV events during remdesivir treatment, which collectively paves the way for a therapeutic opportunity to prevent such events in the future.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryRemdesivir s activity as a selective agonist of urotensin-II receptor underlies its known cardiotoxicity in anti-viral therapy.",

    "abstract": "The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic prompted rapid development of COVID-19 vaccines. Although several vaccines have received emergency approval through various public health agencies, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues. Emergent variants of concern, waning immunity in the vaccinated, evidence that vaccines may not prevent transmission and inequity in vaccine distribution have driven continued development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 to address these public health needs. In this report, we evaluated a novel self-amplifying replicon RNA vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in a pigtail macaque model of COVID-19 disease. We found that this vaccine elicited strong binding and neutralizing antibody responses. While binding antibody responses were sustained, neutralizing antibody waned to undetectable levels after six months but were rapidly recalled and conferred protection from disease when the animals were challenged 7 months after vaccination as evident by reduced viral replication and pathology in the lower respiratory tract, reduced viral shedding in the nasal cavity and lower concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the lung. Cumulatively, our data demonstrate in pigtail macaques that a self-amplifying replicon RNA vaccine can elicit durable and protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Furthermore, these data provide evidence that this vaccine can provide durable protective efficacy and reduce viral shedding even after neutralizing antibody responses have waned to undetectable levels.",

In this work, whole blood cultures from moderate or severe COVID-19 patients were used to assess the potential of B12 as adjuvant drug. The vitamin normalized the expression of a panel of inflammatory genes still dysregulated in the leukocytes despite glucocorticoid therapy during hospitalization. B12 also increased the flux of the sulfur amino acid pathway, raising the bioavailability of methyl. Accordingly, B12-induced downregulation of CCL3 strongly and negatively correlated with the hypermethylation of CpGs in its regulatory regions. Transcriptome analysis revealed that B12 attenuates the effects of COVID-19 on most inflammation-related pathways affected by the disease. As far as we are aware, this is the first study to demonstrate that pharmacological modulation of epigenetic marks in leukocytes favorably regulates central components of COVID-19 physiopathology.\n\nTeaserB12 has great potential as an adjuvant drug for alleviating inflammation in COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Non-pharmaceutical COVID-19 interventions have dramatically modified the transmission dynamics of pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2. In many countries, reports have shown that implementation of population-wide lockdowns led to substantial reductions in invasive bacterial disease caused by respiratory bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae. By contrast, most European countries reported increased antibiotic resistance among S. pneumoniae isolates from 2019 to 2020. To disentangle impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic responses on bacterial epidemiology in the community setting, we propose a mathematical model formalizing simultaneous transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and antibiotic-sensitive and -resistant strains of S. pneumoniae. The impacts of population-wide lockdowns, isolation of COVID-19 cases, changes in antibiotic consumption due to altered healthcare-seeking behavior and prophylactic use in the early pandemic were explored across six pandemic scenarios. Our model was able to reproduce the observed trends, showing how lockdowns substantially reduce invasive pneumococcal disease incidence, while surges in prophylactic antibiotic prescribing favor disease caused by resistant strains. Surges in COVID-19 cases were associated with increased antibiotic resistance rates across all pandemic scenarios. Introducing synergistic within-host SARS-CoV-2-pneumococcus interactions further exacerbates increasing incidence of resistant disease. When data availability is limited, mathematical modeling can help improve our understanding of the complex interactions between COVID-19 and antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Nature has provided a vast landscape of organisms through evolution, each with unique phenotypic traits adapted to varying environments. Nevertheless, host selection in biotechnological research is exceedingly dominated by empirical preference, where the endogenous physiology of the selected host is often not suited to the desired application. Considering that large parts of cellular regulation and metabolism remain obscure, empirical selection of a preferred model organism may lead to undue caveats in further engineering attempts, arising from intrinsic metabolism. One reason for the empirical host selection is the lack of engineering tools for screening novel organisms. In this study, we provide a modular, single vector-based expression platform, compatible with a wide range of prokaryotes. It centers around a tight and titratable promoter system, inducible by anhydrotetracyclin within an 84-fold dynamic range. It enables easy screening of recombinant proteins and pathways in both mesophilic and thermophilic Gram-negative and Gram-positive hosts. Overall, this platform enables simple screening of heterologous expression and production in a variety of hosts, including the exploration of previously unconsidered hosts thereby aiding the transition from empirical to data-driven host selection.",

However, the longevity and functional role of these cells are poorly defined in COVID-19 convalescents and vaccine recipients. Here, we longitudinally investigated the dynamics and functional roles of spike-specific circulating TFH cells and their subsets in convalescents at the 2nd, 5th, 8th, 12th and 24th months after COVID-19 symptom onset and in vaccinees after two and three doses of inactivated vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 infection elicited robust spike-specific TFH cell and antibody responses, of which spike-specific CXCR3+ TFH cells but not spike-specific CXCR3- TFH cells and neutralizing antibodies were persistent for at least two years in more than 80% of convalescents who experienced symptomatic COVID-19, which was well coordinated between spike-specific TFH cell and antibody responses at the 5th month after infection. Inactivated vaccine immunization also induced spike-specific TFH cell and antibody responses; however, these responses rapidly declined after six months with a two-dose standard administration, and a third dose significantly promoted antibody maturation and potency.

We also assessed cobas 5800 assay reproducibility by repetitive testing of specimens with VL close to values used as thresholds for patient management or classification.\n\nResultsThe correlation between VL measurements generated using cobas 5800 vs 6800 was extremely high, with r2 correlation coefficients between 0.990 and 0.999 for the three targets at the different sites. The slope of the Deming regression line ranged from 0.994 (HBV, site 3) to 1.025 (HIV-1, site 1). The standard deviation values ranged from 0.04 to 0.19 log10 IU/mL for HBV, 0.05 to 0.31 log10 IU/mL for HCV, and 0.05 to 0.31 log10 copies/mL for HIV-1. In general, variability was higher at lower VL. Between 98.6% and 100% of results fell within the allowable total difference zone that defines expected variability on the existing 6800/8800 system.\n\nConclusionsThis multi-site comparison study demonstrates equivalent performance of the new cobas 5800 system compared to cobas 6800.

    "abstract": "Bacterial colonies composed of genetically identical individuals can diversify to yield variant cells with distinct genotypes. Variant outgrowth manifests as sectors. Here, we show that Type 6 secretion system (T6SS)-driven cell death in Vibrio cholerae colonies imposes a selective pressure for the emergence of variant strains that can evade T6SS-mediated killing. T6SS-mediated cell death occurs in two distinct spatio-temporal phases, and each phase is driven by a particular T6SS toxin. The first phase is regulated by quorum sensing and drives sectoring. The second phase does not require the T6SS-injection machinery. Variant V. cholerae strains isolated from colony sectors encode mutated quorum-sensing components that confer growth advantages by suppressing T6SS-killing activity while simultaneously boosting T6SS-killing defenses. Our findings show that the T6SS can eliminate sibling cells suggesting a role in intra-specific antagonism.

However global warming causes abrupt erosion and gradual thaw, which make these stocks vulnerable to microbial decomposition into greenhouse gases. Here, we investigated the microbial response to abrupt in situ permafrost thaw. We sequenced the total RNA of a 1 m deep soil core consisting of up to 26500-year-old permafrost material from an active abrupt erosion site. We analysed the microbial community in the active layer soil, the recently thawed, and the intact permafrost and found maximum RNA:DNA ratios indicating a microbial bloom in recently thawed permafrost. Several fast-growing prokaryotic taxa dominated thawed permafrost, including Sphingobacteriales, Burkholderiales, and Nitrosomonadales. Overall, the thaw state and soil moisture consistently explained changes in community composition, with especially the permafrost community being significantly distinct from thawed soils. Predation correlated with changes in prokaryotic composition. Bacterial grazers were dominated by Myxococcales and abundant in the active layer. In contrast, protozoa, especially Cercozoa and Ciliophora, doubled in relative abundance in thawed layers. Our findings highlight the ecological importance of a rapid development of microbial blooms as well as the successive predation as biological control mechanism in abruptly thawing permafrost.\n\nOne sentence summaryUsing total RNA from an up to 26500-year-old abruptly eroding permafrost site in Greenland, we described a microbial bloom and its controls, including bacterial and microeukaryotic predators.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=146 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499897v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ab79eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d0146org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bec509org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@179f397_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Contractile injection systems (CISs) are bacteriophage tail-like structures that mediate bacterial cell-cell interactions. While CISs are highly abundant across diverse bacterial phyla, representative gene clusters in Gram-positive organisms remain poorly studied.\n\nHere we characterize a CIS in the Gram-positive multicellular model organism Streptomyces coelicolor and show, that in contrast to most other CISs, S. coelicolor CIS (CISSc) mediate cell death in response to stress and impact cellular development. CISSc are expressed in the cytoplasm of vegetative hyphae and not released into the medium. Our cryo-electron microscopy structure enabled the engineering of non-contractile and fluorescently tagged CISSc assemblies. Cryo-electron tomography showed that CISSc contraction is linked to reduced cellular integrity. Fluorescence light microscopy furthermore revealed that CISSc contraction mediates cell death upon encountering different types of stress. Finally, the absence of functional CISSc had an impact on hyphal differentiation and secondary metabolite production.\n\nOur results provide new functional insights into CISs in Gram-positive organisms and a framework for studying novel intracellular roles, including regulated cell death and life cycle progression in multicellular bacteria.",

Here, we used a cohort of 38 school-aged children (19 with asthma) and 57 adults (17 with asthma) to develop a model that aids in the design of mechanistic experiments in gnotobiotic mice. These experiments show that enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is associated with increased gut permeability, oxidative stress, and markers of Th17-mediated inflammation in the lungs of mice following ovalbumin sensitization and challenge (OSC). Further, ETBF is enriched in a human population with asthma compared to healthy controls. Our results provide evidence that ETBF has the potential to alter the phenotype of airway inflammation in a subset of patients with asthma outside of early childhood which suggests that therapies targeting the gut microbiota may be helpful tools for asthma control.",

    "abstract": "The cyanobacterium Chroococcidiopsis contains species found in extreme environments, thus providing the opportunity to study adaptation to a range of environments within the confines of a single genus. Due to its extremophilic nature, it has attracted attention for space settlement as well as a model for life elsewhere. In this study, eight unialgal strains from diverse habitats, isolated in unialgal culture and grown in laboratory conditions, were characterized for their ability to survive a range of extreme environments including UVC (254 nm) radiation, oxidative damage, desiccation, and repeated freeze/thawing. The study revealed two previously uncharacterized saltwater isolates of Chroococcidiopsis that were more radiation resistant than most of the other isolates. Isolate CCMP 1991 from Hawaii survived up to 1750 J{middle dot}m-2, and isolate CCMP 3184 from Samoa survived up to 1000 J{middle dot}m-2 (254 nm UVR) compared with 250 J{middle dot}m-2 for most other isolates tested. These two UV radiation-resistant isolates are closely related phylogenetically, but inhabit different environments. Each was further characterized for its ability to repair DNA damage as assessed by the repair of UV- induced thymine dimers and for oxidative damage tolerance via resistance to H2O2-induced (oxidative) damage. Both isolates repaired thymine dimers faster in the light than in the dark with the Hawaiian isolate repairing faster than the Samoan isolate in the light, suggesting repair by photoreactivation. The Hawaiian isolate was more tolerant to H2O2 exposure than the Samoan isolate, indicating a possible role for antioxidants in the protection of the cell. Both isolates were more tolerant than the other isolates tested to freeze/thawing in liquid nitrogen, which is also known to cause DNA damage. Spectral absorbance scans were performed to detect pigments in each isolate. While all showed peaks likely to be chlorophyll a, carotenoids, phycocyanin, scytonemin and MAAs, the Hawaiian isolate contained a pigment that absorbed at around 325 nm that none of the other isolates contained. Although this pigment is outside the range of UVC absorbance, it is hypothesized that it may play a role in DNA protection as a UV sunscreen or as an antioxidant. The phenotypic similarities in radiation resistance and freeze/thawing resistance among the Hawaiian, Somoan and Negev isolates appear to be the result of environmental adaptation rather than phylogenetic markers as the first of these have been previously shown to be part of a saltwater clade, while the Negev strain falls within a freshwater clade. As pigmentation, and likely resistance to other environmental conditions, can be induced, these data provide a baseline study of strains in an uninduced state. Thus, the true environmental limits to Chroococcidiopsis likely go beyond our current knowledge. The implications of this is discussed in relation to space exploration",

Here, we use an intensively studied wild population of wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) to examine how vertical (maternal) and horizontal (social) transmission routes influence gut microbiota composition throughout life. We identify independent signals of maternal transmission (sharing of taxa between a mother and her offspring) and social transmission (sharing of taxa predicted by the social network), whose relative magnitudes shift as hosts age. In early life, gut microbiota composition is predicted to a similar extent by both maternal and social relationships, but by adulthood the impact of maternal transmission becomes undetectable, leaving only a signal of social transmission. By exploring which taxa drive the maternal transmission signal, we further identify a candidate maternally-transmitted bacterial family in wood mice, the Lactobacillaceae. Overall, our findings suggest a shifting transmission landscape for wild mice, with a mothers influence on microbiota composition waning as offspring age, while the impact of social contacts remains strong and consistent.",

    "abstract": "Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is characterized by extensive skin lesions associated with an aggressive inflammatory reaction. Despite the extensive inflammation, CL lesions are usually painless, indicating that Leishmania infection may trigger anti-nociceptive activities in the infected tissues. To this date, the molecular mechanisms responsible for this clinical phenomenon have not been identified. Through an untargeted metabolomic analysis by mass spectrometry, we found enriched anti-nociceptive metabolic pathways in mice infected with Leishmania (L.) mexicana. In particular, endogenous purines were elevated at the lesion site during chronic infection, as well as in vitro in infected macrophages, compared to non-infected mice. These purines have known anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties by acting through adenosine receptors and inhibiting transient receptor potential channels of the vanilloid subtype 1 (TRPV1). Additionally, purine metabolites can promote interleukin (IL)-10 production, with a subsequent decrease in inflammation and pain sensitivity. We also found arachidonic acid metabolism enriched in the ear lesions compared to the non-infected controls. Arachidonic acid is a metabolite of anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG). These endocannabinoids act on cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 and TRPV1 channels to exert anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Our study provides the first evidence of metabolic pathways upregulated during L. mexicana infection that may mediate anti-nociceptive effects experienced by CL patients and identifies macrophages as a source of these metabolites.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=170 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503319v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@576ef2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@34d939org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a13478org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7bcab6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG L. mexicana infection promotes the production of purines, as well as endocannabinoid mediators, which could act on different channels of dorsal root ganglia neuron to inhibit nociception.\n\nC_FIG",

However, there was no structural evidence for these. Herein we activated the EhV-ATPase complex with ATP and identified multiple structures consisting of a total of six states of this complex by using cryo-electron microscopy. The orientations of the rotor complex during turnover, especially in the intermediates, were not as perfectly uniform as expected. The densities in the nucleotide binding pockets in the V1 domain indicated the different catalytic conditions for the six conformations. The off-axis rotor and its interactions with the stator a-subunit during rotation suggests that this non-uniform rotor rotation is performed through the entire complex.",

Recently, ubiquitination was also implicated in the integrity of quiescent endothelium, as it differentially controls the localization and stability of adhesion- and signaling proteins. We found that inhibition of E1 ubiquitin ligases induces a rapid, reversible loss of integrity in quiescent, primary human endothelial monolayers, accompanied by increased F-actin stress fibers and the formation of intercellular gaps. Concomitantly, total protein and activity of the actin-regulating GTPase RhoB, but not its close homologue RhoA, increase [~]10-fold in 5-8 h. The depletion of RhoB, but not of RhoA, the inhibition of actin contractility and the inhibition of protein synthesis all significantly rescue the loss of cell-cell contact induced by E1 ligase inhibition. Our data suggest that in quiescent human endothelial cells, the continuous and fast turnover of short-lived proteins that negatively regulate cell-cell contact, is essential to preserve monolayer integrity.",

    "abstract": "With antibiotic-resistant bacteria threatening our ability to treat common infections, new lead compounds with distinct target binding sites and limited cross-resistance are urgently needed. Natural products that inhibit the bacterial ribosome - a target for more than half of the antibiotics in use today - are a promising source of such leads and have the potential to be developed into potent drugs through structure-guided design. However, because the mechanisms of action of many of these compounds are not well understood, they are often poor candidates for a structure-based approach. Here, we use inverse toeprinting coupled to next-generation sequencing to show that the aromatic polyketide tetracenomycin X (TcmX) primarily inhibits the formation of a peptide bond between an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA and a terminal Gln-Lys (QK) motif in the nascent polypeptide. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, we reveal that translation inhibition at QK motifs occurs via an unusual mechanism involving sequestration of the 3 adenosine of peptidyl-tRNALys in the drug-occupied nascent polypeptide exit tunnel of the ribosome. Our study provides mechanistic insights into the mode of action of TcmX on the bacterial ribosome and suggests a path forward for the development of novel antibiotics based on a common aromatic polyketide scaffold.",

Here, we report that AFF1 and AFF4 show distinct genomic distribution patterns around TSS. AFF1 mainly binds upstream of TSS, while AFF4 is enriched downstream of TSS. Pol II occupancies are reduced genome-widely after depletion of AFF1, but not AFF4. Interestingly, in a subset of active genes with strong AFF4 binding signature, AFF4 disruption causes slow elongation and early termination, while AFF1 deletion mirrors the transcriptional defects observed in the fast Pol II mutant. Furthermore, AFF4 knockdown leads to increased AFF1 levels at chromatin, and vice versa. In summary, our data demonstrate that AFF1 and AFF4 function, to some extent, antagonistically to ensure proper Pol II transcription.",

To fill this gap, we developed a strategy based on tagging of proteasomes with promiscuous biotin ligases and generated a new mouse model enabling the quantification of proteasome interactions by mass spectrometry. We show that biotin ligases can be incorporated in fully assembled proteasomes without negative impact on their activity.

    "abstract": "Metabolite annotation continues to be the widely accepted bottleneck in non-targeted metabolomics workflows. Annotation of metabolites typically relies on a combination of high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) with parent and tandem measurements, isotope cluster evaluations, and Kendrick mass defect (KMD) analysis. Chromatographic retention time matching with standards is often used at the later stages of the process, which can also be followed by metabolite isolation and structure confirmation utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The measurement of gas phase collision cross section (CCS) values by ion mobility (IM) spectrometry also adds an important dimension to this workflow by generating an additional molecular parameter that can be used for filtering unlikely structures. The millisecond timescale of IM spectrometry allows the rapid measurement of CCS values and allows easy pairing with existing MS workflows. Here, we report on a highly accurate machine learning algorithm (CCSP 2.0) in an open-source Jupyter Notebook format to predict CCS values based on linear support vector regression models. This tool allows customization of the training set to the needs of the user, enabling the production of models for new adducts or previously unexplored molecular classes. CCSP produces predictions with accuracy equal to or greater than existing machine learning approaches such as CCSbase, DeepCCS and AllCCS, while being better aligned with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) data principles. Another unique aspect of CCSP 2.0 its inclusion of a large library of 1613 molecular descriptors via the Mordred Python package, further encoding the fine aspects of isomeric molecular structures. CCS prediction accuracy was tested using CCS values in the McLean CCS Compendium with median relative errors of 1.25, 1.73 and 1.87% for the 170 [M-H]-, 155 [M+H]+ and 138 [M+Na]+ adducts tested. For class-matched data sets, CCS predictions via CCSP allowed filtering of 36.1% of incorrect structures while retaining a total of 100% of the correct annotations using a {Delta}CCS threshold of 2.8% and a mass error of 10 ppm.",

Proprioceptors are diverse: different subtypes detect different features of joint kinematics, such as position, directional movement, and vibration. However, because they are located within complex and dynamic peripheral tissues, the underlying mechanisms of proprioceptor feature selectivity remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate molecular and biomechanical contributions to proprioceptor diversity in the Drosophila leg. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we found that different proprioceptor subtypes express similar complements of mechanosensory and other ion channels. However, anatomical reconstruction of the proprioceptive organ and connected tendons revealed major biomechanical differences between proprioceptor subtypes. We constructed a computational model of the proprioceptors and tendons, which identified a putative biomechanical mechanism for joint angle selectivity. The model also predicted the existence of a goniotopic map of joint angle among position-tuned proprioceptors, which we confirmed using calcium imaging. Our findings suggest that biomechanical specialization is a key determinant of proprioceptor feature selectivity in Drosophila.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe function of GABAergic synapses is critically shaped by cell adhesion proteins that recruit GABAARs to synapses and mediate transsynaptic signalling, but the synapse-type-specific function of such synaptic adhesion proteins and their mutual interaction remain incompletely understood. A ubiquitous cell adhesion protein at GABAergic synapses is Neuroligin-2 (Nlgn2), which recruits synaptic GABAARs by promoting the assembly of the postsynaptic gephyrin scaffold. While Nlgn2 is present at virtually all GABAergic synapses throughout the forebrain, its loss affects different GABAergic synapse subtypes with different severity, indicating that synapse-specific interactors and synapse-organizer-redundancies define the function of Nlgn2 for a given synapse type. Here we investigated how Nlgn2 function at GABAergic synapses in mouse hippocampal area CA1 is modulated by two recently identified interaction partners, MDGA1 and MDGA2. We show that Nlgn2 and MDGA1 colocalize most prominently in the stratum radiatum (S.R.) of area CA1, and that combined Nlgn2 and MDGA1 deletion causes a layer-specific exacerbation of the loss of gephyrin puncta in layer S.R. seen following Nlgn2 deletion. Intriguingly, combined Nlgn2 and MDGA1 deletion concurrently ameliorates the abnormal cytosolic gephyrin aggregation, the reduction in inhibitory synaptic transmission and the exacerbated anxiety-related behavior seen in Nlgn2 knockout (KO) mice. In contrast, heterozygous deletion of MDGA2 in Nlgn2 KO mice has only minor effects on gephyrin and GABAAR puncta and does not normalize cytosolic gephyrin aggregates, inhibitory synaptic transmission or anxiety-related behavior. Our data indicate that MDGA1, but not MDGA2, modulates Nlgn2 function, primarily by regulating the formation of cytosolic gephyrin aggregates. Given that both Nlgn2 and the MDGA family of proteins have been linked to psychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizophrenia, our data lead to the notion that abnormal gephyrin aggregation may contribute to the pathophysiology of these disorders, and that intervention with gephyrin aggregation could present a novel therapeutic strategy.",

    "abstract": "Opioid signaling has been shown to be critically important in the neuromodulation of sensory circuits in the superficial spinal cord. Agonists of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) elicit itch, whereas agonists of the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) have been shown to inhibit itch. Despite the clear roles of MOR and KOR for the modulation itch, whether the delta-opioid receptor (DOR) is involved in the regulation of itch remained unknown. Here, we show that intrathecal administration of DOR agonists suppresses chemical itch and that intrathecal application of DOR antagonists is sufficient to evoke itch. We identify that spinal enkephalin neurons co-express neuropeptide Y (NPY), a peptide previously implicated in the inhibition of itch. In the spinal cord, DOR overlapped with both the NPY receptor (NPY1R) and KOR, suggesting that DOR neurons represent a site for convergent itch information in the dorsal horn. Lastly, we found that neurons co-expressing DOR and KOR showed significant Fos induction following pruritogen-evoked itch. These results uncover a role for DOR in the modulation of itch in the superficial dorsal horn.\n\nPerspectiveThis article reveals the role of the delta opioid receptor in itch. Intrathecal administration of delta agonists suppresses itch whereas the administration of delta antagonists is sufficient to induce itch. These studies highlight the importance of delta-opioid signaling for the modulation of itch behaviors, which may represent new targets for the management of itch disorders.",

However, there are disparities between the mouse and human IgE biology, and the role of PI3K p110{delta} in the production of human IgE is yet to be determined. To investigate the effect of PI3K p110{delta} inhibition in the production of human IgE we isolated human B cells from tonsil tissue and stimulated them with IL-4 and anti-CD40 antibody to induce class switching to IgE and IgG1 in the presence or absence of IC87114, a small molecule inhibitor of PI3K p110{delta}. Using FACS, RT-PCR and ELISA we examined the effect of PI3K p110{delta} inhibition on IgE production and also determined the mechanisms involved. Unlike in mice, we observed that PI3K p110{delta} inhibition significantly reduces the number of IgE+ switched cells and the amounts of secreted IgE in IL4 and anti-CD40 cultures. However, the number of IgG1+ cells and secreted IgG1 were largely unaffected by PI3K p110{delta} inhibition. The expression levels of AID, {varepsilon} and {gamma}1 germinal transcripts or other factors involved in the regulation of CSR to IgE and IgG1 were also unaffected by IC87114. However, we found that IC87114 significantly decreases the proliferation of tonsil B cells stimulated with IL-4 and anti-CD40, specifically reducing the frequency of cells that had undergone 4 divisions or more. Our data identifies proliferation as the key mechanism through which PI3K p110{delta} regulates CSR of human B cells to IgE and highlights PI3K p110{delta} as a pharmacological target for the treatment of allergic disease.",

    "abstract": "From a metabolic perspective, molecular oxygen (O2) is arguably the most significant constituent of Earths atmosphere. Nearly every facet of microbial physiology is sensitive to the presence and concentration of O2, which is the most favorable terminal electron acceptor used by biological organisms and also a dangerously reactive oxidant. As O2 has such sweeping implications for physiology, researchers have developed diverse approaches to measure O2 concentrations in natural and laboratory settings. Recent improvements to phosphorescent O2 sensors piqued our interest due to the promise of optical measurement of spatiotemporal O2 dynamics. However, we found that our preferred bacterial model, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, secretes more than one molecule that quenches such sensors, complicating O2 measurements in PA14 cultures and biofilms. Assaying supernatants from cultures of 9 bacterial species demonstrated that this phenotype is common: all supernatants quenched a soluble O2 probe substantially. Phosphorescent O2 probes are often embedded in solid support for protection, but an embedded probe called O2NS was quenched by most supernatants as well. Measurements using pure compounds indicated that quenching is due to interactions with redox-active small molecules including phenazines and flavins. Uncharged and weakly-polar molecules like pyocyanin were especially potent quenchers of O2NS. These findings underscore that optical O2 measurements made in the presence of bacteria should be carefully controlled to ensure that O2, and not bacterial secretions, is measured, and motivate the design of custom O2 probes for specific organisms to circumvent sensitivity to redox-active metabolites.\n\nImportanceWhen they are closely-packed, as in biofilms, colonies, and soils, microbes can consume O2 faster than it diffuses. As such, O2 concentrations in natural environments can vary greatly over time and space, even on the micrometer scale. Wetting soil, for example, slows O2 diffusion higher in the soil column, which, in concert with microbial respiration, greatly diminishes [O2] at depth. Given that variation in [O2] has outsized implications for microbial physiology, there is great interest in measuring the dynamics of [O2] in microbial cultures and biofilms. We demonstrate that certain classes of bacterial metabolites frustrate optical measurement of [O2] with phosphorescent sensors, but also that some species (e.g. E. coli) do not produce problematic secretions under the conditions tested. Our work therefore offers a strategy for identifying organisms and culture conditions in which optical quantification of spatiotemporal [O2] dynamics with current sensors is feasible.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cells at fluid interfaces can self-assemble into collective communities with stunning macroscopic morphologies. Within these soft, living materials, called pellicles, constituent cells gain group-level survival advantages including increased antibiotic resistance. However, the regulatory and structural components that drive pellicle self-patterning are not well defined. Here, using Vibrio cholerae as our model system, we report that two sets of matrix proteins and a key quorum-sensing regulator jointly orchestrate the sequential mechanical instabilities underlying pellicle morphogenesis, culminating in fractal patterning. A pair of matrix proteins, RbmC and Bap1, maintain pellicle localization at the interface and prevent self-peeling. A single matrix protein, RbmA, drives a morphogenesis program marked by a cascade of ever finer wrinkles with fractal scaling in wavelength. Artificial expression of rbmA restores fractal wrinkling to a {Delta}rbmA mutant and enables precise tuning of fractal dimensions. The quorum-sensing regulatory small RNAs Qrr1-4 first activate matrix synthesis to launch pellicle primary wrinkling and ridge instabilities. Subsequently, via a distinct mechanism, Qrr1-4 suppress fractal wrinkling to promote fine modulation of pellicle morphology. Our results connect cell-cell signaling and architectural components to morphogenic patterning and suggest that manipulation of quorum-sensing regulators or synthetic control of rbmA expression could underpin strategies to engineer soft biomaterial morphologies on demand.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes can transmit several arboviruses, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). When blood-feeding on a virus-infected human, the mosquito ingests the virus into the midgut (stomach), where it replicates and must overcome the midgut barrier to disseminate to other organs and ultimately be transmitted via the saliva. Current tools to study mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) include 2D-cell culture systems and in vivo mosquito infection models, which offer great advantages, yet have some limitations.\n\nHere, we describe a long-term ex vivo culture of Ae. aegypti midguts. Cultured midguts were metabolically active for 7 days in a 96-well plate at 28{degrees}C and were permissive to ZIKV, DENV, Ross River virus (RRV) and CHIKV. Ex vivo midguts from Culex pipiens mosquitoes were found to be permissive to Usutu virus (USUV). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed viral protein synthesis in CHIKV-infected midguts of Ae. aegypti. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy revealed replication and spread of a reporter DENV in specific regions of the midgut. In addition, two known antiviral molecules, {beta}-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) and 7-deaza-2-C-methyladenosine (7DMA), were able to inhibit CHIKV and ZIKV replication, respectively, in the ex vivo model.\n\nTogether, our results show that ex vivo midguts can be efficiently infected with mosquito-borne alpha- and flaviviruses and employed to evaluate antiviral drugs. Furthermore, the setup can be extended to other mosquito species. Ex vivo midgut cultures could thus be a new model to study MBVs, offering the advantage of reduced biosafety measures compared to infecting living mosquitoes.\n\nImportanceMosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) are a significant global health threat since they can cause severe diseases in humans, such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and chronic arthritis. MBVs rely on the mosquito vector to infect new hosts and perpetuate virus transmission. No therapeutics are currently available. The study of arbovirus infection in the mosquito vector can greatly contribute to elucidating strategies for controlling arbovirus transmission. This work investigated the infection of midguts from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in an ex vivo platform. We found several MBVs capable of replicating in the midgut tissue, including viruses of major health importance, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Additionally, antiviral compounds reduced arbovirus infection in the cultured midgut tissue. Overall, the midgut model emerges as a useful tool for diverse applications such as studying tissue-specific responses to virus infection and screening potential anti-arboviral molecules.",

    "abstract": "Dystroglycan (DG) requires extensive post-translational processing to function as a receptor for extracellular matrix proteins containing laminin-G-like (LG) domains. Matriglycan is an elongated polysaccharide of alternating xylose and glucuronic acid that is uniquely synthesized on -dystroglycan (-DG) by like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (LARGE1) and binds with high affinity to matrix proteins like laminin. Defects in the post-translational processing of -DG that result in a shorter form of matriglycan reduce the size of -DG and decrease laminin binding, leading to various forms of muscular dystrophy. However, little is known regarding mechanisms that generate full-length matriglycan on -DG (~150-250 kDa). Here, we show that LARGE1 can only synthesize a short, non-elongated form of matriglycan in mouse skeletal muscle that lacks the DG N-terminus (-DGN), resulting in a ~100-125 kDa -DG. This smaller form of -DG binds laminin and maintains specific force but does not prevent muscle pathophysiology, including reduced force induced by eccentric contractions and abnormalities in neuromuscular junctions. Collectively, our study demonstrates that -DGN is required for LARGE1 to extend matriglycan to its full mature length on -DG and thus prevent muscle pathophysiology.",

The SecYEG-dependent complex is responsible for inserting proteins into the lipid bilayer, and this process is facilitated by YidC. In addition, YidC acts as a chaperone during the folding processes of proteins. Multiple investigations have conclusively shown that the gram-positive bacterium YidC has SecY-independent insertion mechanisms. Through the use of microsecond level all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we have carried out the first in-depth investigation of the YidC protein originating from gram-negative bacteria. This research sheds light on the significance of several structural areas related to YidC at an atomic level by utilizing equilibrium molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In this research, multiple models of YidC inside the lipid bilayer were constructed in order to achieve a deeper understanding of the critical role of the C2 loop and the extra periplasmic domain present in gram-negative YidC. According to the results of our research, the C2 loop is responsible for the overall stabilization of the protein, most notably in the transmembrane region, and it also has an allosteric influence on the periplasmic domain. We have found critical interactions that contribute to the stability of the protein as well as its functional aspect.

    "abstract": "Sex is a significant contributor to the outcome of human infections. Males are frequently more susceptible to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, which is often attributed to a weaker immune response. In contrast, a heightened immune response in females enables better pathogen elimination but leaves females more predisposed to autoimmune diseases. Unfortunately, the underlying basis for sex-specific immune responses remains poorly understood. Here, we show a sex-specific difference in the CD8+ T cell response to an enteric virus, Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). We found that CVB3 induced expansion of CD8+ T cells in female mice but not in male mice. CVB3 also increased the proportion and number of CD11ahiCD62Llo CD8+ T cells in female mice, indicative of activation. Further, this response was independent of the inoculation route and type I interferon. Using a recombinant CVB3 virus expressing a model CD8+ T cell epitope, we found that the expansion of CD8+ T cells is viral-specific and not due to bystander activation. These data demonstrate that CVB3 induces a sex-dependent CD8+ T cell response and highlight the importance of sex-specific immune responses to viral pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The transcription of stress-inducible genes requires synchronized and robust activation, which is critical for organismal survival and homeostasis. The function of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway is required for the activation of immediate early genes (IEGs), including EGR1 and FOS, for cell growth and proliferation1-3. In addition, recent studies have identified topoisomerase II (TOP2) as one of the important regulators of the transcriptional activation of IEGs4-6. However, the mechanism underlying transcriptional regulation involving TOP2 in IEG activation has remained unknown. Here, we demonstrate that ERK2, but not ERK1, is important for IEG transcriptional activation and report a critical ELK1 binding sequence for ERK2 function at the EGR1 gene. Our data indicate that both ERK1 and ERK2 extensively phosphorylate the C-terminal domain of TOP2B at mutual and distinctive residues. Although both ERK1 and ERK2 enhance the catalytic rate of TOP2B required to relax positive DNA supercoiling, ERK1 can relax the DNA by itself and produces a semi-relaxed DNA, which is apparently resistant to TOP2B catalysis. Inhibition of ERK2 kinase activity or ERK2 knock-down interferes with transcription and deregulates TOP2B in IEGs. Furthermore, we obtained the first cryo-EM structure of the human cell-purified TOP2B and etoposide together with the EGR1 transcriptional start site (50 nt; -30 to +20) that has the strongest affinity to TOP2B within -423 to +332. The structure elucidated in our studies showed TOP2B-mediated breakage and dramatic bending of the double-stranded DNA, comparable to previously reported structures of TOP2. Our cell-based analyses showed transcriptional activation by etoposide and transcriptional inhibition by ICRF193 at EGR1 and FOS, suggesting that TOP2B-mediated DNA break to favor transcriptional activation. Taken together, this study suggests that activated ERK2 phosphorylates TOP2B to regulate TOP2-DNA interactions and favor transcriptional activation in IEGs. We propose that TOP2B association, catalysis, and dissociation on its substrate DNA are important processes for regulating transcription and that ERK2-mediated TOP2B phosphorylation may be key for the catalysis and dissociation steps.",

BRCA1/BARD1 RING domains interact with nucleosomes to facilitate mono-ubiquitylation of distinct residues on the C-terminal tail of histone H2A. These enzymatic domains constitute a small fraction of the heterodimer, raising the possibility of functional chromatin interactions involving other regions such as the BARD1 C-terminal domains that bind nucleosomes containing the DNA damage signal H2A K15-Ub and H4 K20me0, or portions of the expansive intrinsically disordered regions found in both subunits. Herein, we reveal novel interactions that support robust H2A ubiquitylation activity mediated through a high-affinity, intrinsically disordered DNA-binding region of BARD1. These interactions support BRCA1/BARD1 recruitment to chromatin and sites of DNA damage in cells and contribute to their survival. We also reveal distinct BRCA1/BARD1 complexes that depend on the presence of H2A K15-Ub, including a complex where a single BARD1 subunit spans adjacent nucleosome units. Our findings identify an extensive network of multivalent BARD1- nucleosome interactions that serve as a platform for BRCA1/BARD1-associated functions on chromatin.",

    "abstract": "Combination therapy with penicillin and clindamycin has been a mainstay for treatment of invasive group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infections yet increasing macrolide resistance may limit such treatment for strains displaying MLSB phenotypes. The CDC recently reported erythromycin and clindamycin resistance rates for iGAS exceeding 20% in 2017. Here, we investigated 76 iGAS isolates from 66 patients identified at J.W. Ruby Memorial Hospital in West Virginia from 2020-2021. emm typing was performed using the CDC protocol and database. Resistance genes were detected by PCR and sequencing, whereas antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed in clinical and research laboratories with standard techniques. Median patient age was 42 years (23-86 range). 76% (n=50) of isolates were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, which included both inducible (n=40) and constitutive (n=9) resistance. All emm92 (n=35) and emm11 (n=8) isolates were erythromycin resistant, while the remaining 11% (n=7) of resistant isolates comprised 5 emm types. Susceptible isolates primarily included emm89 (n=6) iGAS. Macrolide resistance was conferred by the plasmid-borne ermT gene in all emm92 isolates and by chromosomally-encoded ermA (n=7), ermB (n=7), and mefA (n=1) in other emm types. Macrolide-resistant iGAS were typically resistant to tetracycline and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Here, we characterized iGAS infections affecting non-pediatric residents across West Virginia. We showed a shift in emm-type distribution compared to historical and national reports, and dominance of macrolide-resistant isolates which raises concern for emerging resistance to commonly-prescribed antibiotics used in treatment of iGAS infections.",
