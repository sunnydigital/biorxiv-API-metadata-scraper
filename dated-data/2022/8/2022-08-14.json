    "abstract": "What causes host-use specificity in herbivorous insects? Population genetic models predict specialization when habitat preference can evolve and there is antagonistic pleiotropy at a performance-affecting locus. But empirically for herbivorous insects, host-use performance is governed by many genetic loci, and antagonistic pleiotropy seems to be rare. Here, we use individual-based quantitative genetic simulation models to investigate the role of pleiotropy in the evolution of sympatric host-use specialization when performance and preference are quantitative traits. We look first at pleiotropies affecting only host-use performance. We find that when the host environment changes slowly the evolution of host-use specialization requires levels of antagonistic pleiotropy much higher than what has been observed in nature. On the other hand, with rapid environmental change or pronounced asymmetries in productivity across host species, the evolution of host-use specialization readily occurs without pleiotropy. When pleiotropies affect preference as well as performance, even with slow environmental change and host species of equal productivity, we observe fluctuations in host-use breadth, with mean specificity increasing with the pervasiveness of antagonistic pleiotropy. So, our simulations show that pleiotropy is not necessary for specialization, although it can be sufficient, provided it is extensive or multifarious.",

    "abstract": "Diterpenoid 3-epicaryoptin (C26H36O9) is abundant in the leaves of Clerodendrum inerme, a traditionally used medicinal plant, having insect antifeedant activities. Here, we aim to explore the cytogenotoxic effects of compound 3-epicaryoptin in Allium cepa root apical meristem cells. A. cepa roots were treated with 3-epicaryoptin (100, 150 & 200 g mL-1 concentration) and the standard compound colchicine (200 g mL-1 concentration) for 2, 4, 4+16 h (4 h treatment followed by 16 h recovery). Cytogenotoxicity was analysed by studying the root growth retardation (RGR), mitotic index (MI), and cellular aberrations. The result showed statistically significant (p<0.01), concentration-dependent RGR effects of 3-epicaryoptin treatment compared with the negative control. Study of cell frequency in different phases of cell division observed a significant (p<0.001) increase in the metaphase cell percentage (66.2{+/-}0.58 %, 150 g mL-1) and which subsequently caused an increase in the frequency of MI (12.29{+/-}0.34 %, 150 g mL-1) at 4h of 3-epicaryoptin treatment and that was comparable with the colchicine action. The cytological study revealed that the 3-epicaryoptin treatment could induce different types of chromosomal abnormalities such as colchicine like metaphase, vagrant chromosomes, sticky chromosomes, anaphase-bridge, and an increased frequency of micronuclei and polyploid cells. These findings indicate that 3-epicaryoptin is cytogenotoxic, and thus C. inerme should be used with caution in traditional medicine.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the mouse visual system have revealed a variety of visual brain areas that are thought to support a multitude of behavioral capacities, ranging from stimulus-reward associations, to goal-directed navigation, and object-centric discriminations. However, an overall understanding of the mouses visual cortex, and how it supports a range behaviors, remains unknown. Here, we take a computational approach to help address these questions, providing a high-fidelity quantitative model of mouse visual cortex and identifying key structural and functional principles underlying that models success. Structurally, we find that a comparatively shallow network structure with a low-resolution input is optimal for modeling mouse visual cortex. Our main finding is functional - that models trained with task-agnostic, selfsupervised objective functions based on the concept of contrastive embeddings are much better matches to mouse cortex, than models trained on supervised objectives or alternative selfsupervised methods. This result is very much unlike in primates where prior work showed that the two were roughly equivalent, naturally leading us to ask the question of why these self-supervised objectives are better matches than supervised ones in mouse. To this end, we show that the self-supervised, contrastive objective builds a general-purpose visual representation that enables the system to achieve better transfer on out-of-distribution visual, scene understanding and reward-based navigation tasks. Our results suggest that mouse visual cortex is a low-resolution, shallow network that makes best use of the mouses limited resources to create a light-weight, general-purpose visual system - in contrast to the deep, high-resolution, and more task-specific visual system of primates.",

    "abstract": "Hormones coordinate long-range cell-cell communication in multicellular organisms and play vital roles in normal physiology, metabolism, and health. Using the newly-completed organism-wide single cell transcriptional atlas of a non-human primate, the mouse lemur (Microcebus murinus), we have systematically identified hormone-producing and -target cells for 87 classes of hormones, and have created a browsable atlas for hormone signaling that reveals previously unreported sites of hormone regulation and species-specific rewiring. Hormone ligands and receptors exhibited cell-type-dependent, stereotypical expression patterns, and their transcriptional profiles faithfully classified the discrete cell types defined by the full transcriptome, despite their comprising less than 1% of the transcriptome. Although individual cell types generally exhibited the same characteristic patterns of hormonal gene expression, a number of examples of similar or seemingly-identical cell types (e.g., endothelial cells of the lung versus of other organs) displayed different hormonal gene expression patterns. By linking ligand-expressing cells to the cells expressing the corresponding receptor, we constructed an organism-wide map of the hormonal cell-cell communication network. The hormonal cell-cell network was remarkably densely and robustly connected, and included classical hierarchical circuits (e.g. pituitary [-&gt;] peripheral endocrine gland [-&gt;] diverse cell types) as well as examples of highly distributed control. The network also included both well-known examples of feedback loops and a long list of potential novel feedback circuits. This primate hormone atlas provides a powerful resource to facilitate discovery of regulation on an organism-wide scale and at single-cell resolution, complementing the single-site-focused strategy of classical endocrine studies. The network nature of hormone regulation and the principles discovered here further emphasize the importance of a systems approach to understanding hormone regulation.",

Here we present an active-feedback single-particle tracking method with simultaneous volumetric imaging of the live cell environment to address this knowledge gap to present unprecedented detail to the extracellular phase of the infectious cycle. We report previously unobserved phenomena in the early stages of the virus-cell interaction, including skimming contact events at the millisecond timescale, orders of magnitude change in diffusion coefficient upon binding, and cylindrical and linear diffusion modes along cellular protrusions. Finally, we demonstrate how this new method can move single-particle tracking from simple monolayer culture towards more tissue-like conditions by tracking single virions in tightly packed epithelial cells. This multi-resolution method presents new opportunities for capturing fast, 3D processes in biological systems.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryActive-feedback 3D single-particle tracking enables an unprecedented look at the early stages of virus-cell interactions.",

This knowledge can be acquired using genomic databanks, by comparing genetic variation in incursion samples against reference samples. Here we use genomic databanks to investigate domestic incursions of two mosquito species in Australia, and assess the performance of genomic tracing methods when databank samples were collected some time ago or are genetically similar. We used a deep learning method to trace a 2021 invasion of Aedes aegypti in Tennant Creek, Northern Territory, to Townsville, Queensland, and to trace two years of Ae. albopictus incursions to two specific islands in the Torres Strait. We observed high precision of tracing despite 30-70 generations separating incursion and reference samples. Targeted assays also provided additional information on the origin of the Tennant Creek Ae. aegypti, in this case by comparing Wolbachia infection data and mitochondrial DNA variation. Patterns of relatedness and inbreeding indicated that Tennant Creek was likely invaded by one family of Ae. aegypti, whereas Torres Strait incursions involved distinct kinship groups. Our results highlight the value of genomic databanks that remain informative over years and for a range of biological conditions, and demonstrate how additional targeted assays (e.g. Wolbachia) can improve inferences.\n\nKey MessageO_LIGenomic tracing can provide valuable information on pest incursions and new invasions.\nC_LIO_LIEvolution will lead to increasing differences between databanks and extant populations.\nC_LIO_LIWe tested how well genomic databanks could trace incursions sampled 30-70 generations later and where genetic differentiation was low.\nC_LIO_LIWe show that tracing methods are robust for a wide range of conditions, and report specific incursion origins for two Aedes species.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that genomic databanks will remain informative over years and for a range of invasive systems.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The fall armyworm (FAW) Spodoptera frugiperda is present in over 70 countries in Africa, Asia, and Oceania. Its rapid dispersal since 2016 when it was first reported in western Africa, and associated devastation to agricultural productivity, highlight the challenges posed by this pest. Currently, its management largely relies on insecticide sprays and transgenic Bacillus thuringiensis toxins, therefore understanding their responses to these agents and characteristics of any resistance genes enables adaptive strategies. In Australia, S. frugiperda was reported at the end of January 2020 in northern Queensland and by March 2020, also in northern Western Australia. As an urgent first response we undertook bioassays on two Australian populations, one each from these initial points of establishment. To assist with preliminary sensitivity assessment, two endemic noctuid pest species, Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura, were concurrently screened to obtain larval LC50 estimates against various insecticides. We characterised known resistance alleles from the VGSC, ACE-1, RyR, and ABCC2 genes to compare with published allele frequencies and bioassay responses from native and invasive S. frugiperda populations. An approximately 10x LC50 difference for indoxacarb was detected between Australian populations, which was approximately 28x higher than that reported from an Indian population. Characterisation of ACE-1 and VGSC alleles provided further evidence of multiple introductions in Asia, and multiple pathways involving genetically distinct individuals into Australia. The preliminary bioassay results and resistance allele patterns from invasive S. frugiperda populations suggest multiple introductions have contributed to the pests spread and challenge the axiom of its rapid  west-to-east spread.",

    "abstract": "Effective proteome homeostasis is key to cellular and organismal survival, and cells therefore contain efficient quality control systems to monitor and remove potentially toxic misfolded proteins. Such general protein quality control to a large extent relies on the efficient and robust delivery of misfolded or unfolded proteins to the ubiquitin-proteasome system. This is achieved via recognition of so-called degradation motifs--degrons--that are assumed to become exposed as a result of protein misfolding. Despite their importance, the nature and sequence properties of quality-control degrons remain elusive. Here, we have used data from a yeast-based screen of 23,600 17-residue peptides to build a predictor of quality-control degrons. The resulting model, QCDPred (Quality Control Degron Prediction), achieves good accuracy using only the sequence composition of the peptides as input. Our analysis reveals that strong degrons are enriched in hydrophobic amino acids and depleted in negatively charged amino acids, in line with the expectation that they are buried in natively folded proteins. We applied QCDPred to the yeast proteome, enabling us to analyse more widely the potential effects of degrons. As an example, we show a correlation between cellular abundance and degron potential in disordered regions of proteins. Together with recent results on membrane proteins, our work suggest that the recognition of exposed hydrophobic residues is a key and generic mechanism for proteome homeostasis. QCDPred is freely available as open source code and via a web interface.",

Since the failure of energy supply of multiple demand sites located in various axonal branches may be a possible reason for the death of these neurons, we were interested in investigating how branching affects mitochondria transport. Besides investigating mitochondria fluxes between the demand sites and mitochondria concentrations, we also studied how the mean age of mitochondria and mitochondria age densities depend on the distance from the soma. We established that if the axon splits into two branches of unequal length, the mean ages of mitochondria and age density distributions in the demand sites are affected by how the mitochondria flux splits at the branching junction (what portion of mitochondria enter the shorter branch and what portion enter the longer branch). However, if the axon splits into two branches of equal length, the mean ages and age densities of mitochondria are independent of how the mitochondria flux splits at the branching junction. This even holds for the case when all mitochondria enter one branch, which is equivalent to a straight axon. Because the mitochondrial membrane potential (which many researchers view as a proxy for mitochondrial health) decreases with mitochondria age, the independence of mitochondria age on whether the axon is symmetrically branched or straight (providing the two axons are of the same length), and on how the mitochondria flux splits at the branching junction, may explain how dopaminergic neurons can sustain very large arbors and still maintain mitochondrial health across branch extremities.",

    "abstract": "Electrically evoked compound action potentials (ECAPs) generated in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) contain features that may be useful for titrating deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy for Parkinsons disease. Delivering a strong therapeutic effect with DBS therapies, however, relies on selectively targeting neural pathways to avoid inducing side effects. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal features of ECAPs in and around the STN across parameter sweeps of stimulation current amplitude, pulse width, and electrode configuration, and used a linear classifier of ECAP responses to predict electrode location. Four non-human primates were implanted unilaterally with either a directional (n=3) or non-directional (n=1) DBS lead targeting the sensorimotor STN. ECAP responses were characterized by primary features (within 1.6 ms after a stimulus pulse) and secondary features (between 1.6-7.4 ms after a stimulus pulse). Using these ECAP features, a linear classifier was able to accurately differentiate electrodes within the STN versus dorsal to the STN in all four subjects. ECAP responses varied systematically with recording and stimulating electrode locations, which provides a subject-specific neuroanatomical basis for selecting electrode configurations in the treatment of Parkinsons disease with DBS therapy.",

However, when an element from an unfolding event mismatches the schema-derived expectations, the coherent narrative is interrupted and an update to the current event model representation is required. Here, we asked whether the perceived incongruence of an item from an unfolding event and its impact on memory relied on the disruption of neural stability patterns preceded by the neural reactivation of the memory representations of the just-encoded event. Our study includes data from 3 different experiments whereby participants encoded images of target objects preceded by trial-unique sequences of events depicting daily routine. We found that neural stability patterns gradually increased throughout the ongoing exposure to a schema-consistent episodic narrative and that the brain stability pattern was interrupted when the encoding of an object of the event was lowly congruent within the ongoing schema representation. We found that the decrease in neural stability for low-congruence items was best seen at [~]1000 ms from object encoding onset when compared to high-congruence items and that this effect was preceded by an enhanced N400 ERP and an increased degree of neural reactivation of the just-encoded episode for low-congruence items. Current results offer new insights into the neural mechanisms and their temporal orchestration that are engaged during online encoding of schema-consistent episodic narratives and the detection of incongruencies.",

    "abstract": "Type 4 pili (T4P) are retractable surface appendages found on numerous bacteria and archaea that play essential roles in various microbial functions, including host colonization by pathogens. An ATPase is required for T4P extension, but the mechanism by which chemical energy is transduced to mechanical energy for pilus extension has not been elucidated. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the BfpD ATPase from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in the presence of either ADP or a mixture of ADP and AMP-PNP. Both structures, solved at 3 [A] resolution, reveal the typical toroid shape of AAA+ ATPases and unambiguous six-fold symmetry. This six-fold symmetry contrasts with the two-fold symmetry previously reported for other T4P extension ATPase structures, all of which were from thermophiles and solved by crystallography. In the presence of the nucleotide mixture, BfpD bound exclusively AMP-PNP and this binding resulted in a modest outward expansion in comparison to the structure in the presence of ADP, suggesting a concerted model for hydrolysis. De novo molecular models reveal a partially open configuration of all subunits where the nucleotide binding site may not be optimally positioned for catalysis. ATPase functional studies reveal modest activity similar to that of other extension ATPases, while calculations indicate that this activity is insufficient to power pilus extension. Our results reveal that, despite similarities in primary sequence and tertiary structure, T4P extension ATPases exhibit divergent quaternary configurations. Our data raise new possibilities regarding the mechanism by which T4P extension ATPases power pilus formation.",

In particular, new and diverse chemical classes of antibiotics are needed, as most antibiotics in clinical development are derivatives of existing drugs. Despite a history of use as antimicrobials, metals and metal-based compounds have largely been overlooked as a source of new chemical matter for antibacterial drug discovery. In this work, we identify several ruthenium complexes, ruthenium red, Ru265, and Ru360, that possess potent antibacterial activity against both laboratory and clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Suppressors with increased resistance were sequenced and found to contain mutations in the mechanosensitive ion channel mscS-1 or the colRS two component system. The antibacterial activity of these compounds translated in vivo to Galleria mellonella larvae and mouse infection models. Finally, we identify strong synergy between these compounds and the antibiotic rifampicin, with a dose-sparing combination therapy showing efficacy in both infection models. Our findings provide clear evidence that these ruthenium complexes are effective antibacterial compounds against a critical priority pathogen and show promise for the development of future therapeutics.",

Unique breakpoint sequences shared across structural variants facilitated stepwise reconstruction of their evolution from a common molecular ancestor. This analysis revealed that virus and virus-host concatemers are unstable and, upon insertion into and excision from chromosomes, facilitate capture, amplification, and recombination of host DNA and chromosomal rearrangements. Evidence of heterocateny was detected in extrachromosomal and intrachromosomal DNA. The data indicate that heterocateny is driven by the dynamic, aberrant replication and recombination of an oncogenic DNA virus, thereby extending known consequences of HPV integration to include promotion of intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution.",

Here, we showed that a protective response to CTLA-4 therapy depended on a mutualistic relationship between microglia and CD4+ T cells. Suppression of gliomas by CD4+ T cells did not require tumor-intrinsic MHC-II expression, but rather was dependent on the selective expression of MHC-II and antigen presentation by local microglia that in turn, sustained CD4+ T cell tumoricidal effector functions. CD4+ T cell secretion of IFN{gamma} made the glioma cells vulnerable to enhanced tumor surveillance and phagocytosis by microglia via the AXL/MER tyrosine kinase receptors that were necessary for tumor suppression. This work illustrates a novel partnership between CD4+ T cells and microglia that unleashes the tumoricidal properties of microglia that can be harnessed to improve immunotherapies for glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Ammonia-oxidising archaea (AOA) are a ubiquitous component of microbial communities and dominate the first stage of nitrification in some soils. While we are beginning to understand soil virus dynamics, we have no knowledge of the composition or activity of those infecting nitrifiers or their potential to influence processes. This study aimed to characterise viruses having infected autotrophic AOA in two nitrifying soils of contrasting pH by following transfer of assimilated CO2-derived 13C from host to virus via DNA stable-isotope probing and metagenomic analysis. Incorporation of 13C into low GC mol% AOA and virus genomes increased DNA buoyant density in CsCl gradients but resulted in co-migration with dominant non-enriched high GC mol% genomes, reducing sequencing depth and contig assembly. We therefore developed a hybrid approach where AOA and virus genomes were assembled from low buoyant density DNA with subsequent mapping of 13C isotopically enriched high buoyant density DNA reads to identify activity of AOA. Metagenome-assembled genomes were different between the two soils and represented a broad diversity of active populations. Sixty-four AOA-infecting viral operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) were identified with no clear relatedness to previously characterised prokaryote viruses. These vOTUs were also distinct between soils, with 42% enriched in 13C derived from hosts. The majority were predicted as capable of lysogeny and auxiliary metabolic genes included an AOA-specific multicopper oxidase suggesting infection may augment copper uptake essential for central metabolic functioning. These findings indicate virus infection of AOA may be a frequent process during nitrification with potential to influence host physiology and activity.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary transitions enable the wide diversity in life histories of plants and animals. This is particularly germane in the development of the germ line in which fitness is a direct readout of evolutionary change. Here, we focused on the gem line of two distinct sea urchin species who shared a common ancestor 50 million years ago. Even though they both rely on inherited mechanisms to specify their germ line, the integration of stage-matched single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets from these two sea urchins revealed a variety of differences in gene expression, including a broader expression of the germ line factor Nanos2 in Lytechinus variegatus (Lv) compared to Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (Sp). In Sp, Nanos2 mRNA expression is highly restricted to the primordial germ cells (PGCs) by a lability element in its 3UTR.

    "abstract": "A common approach in biomechanical analysis of running technique is to average data from several gait cycles to compute a  representative mean. However, the impact of the quantity and selection of gait cycles on biomechanical measures is not well understood. We examined the effects of gait cycle selection on kinematic data by: (i) comparing representative means calculated from varying numbers of gait cycles to  global means from the entire capture period; and (ii) comparing representative means from varying numbers of gait cycles sampled from different parts of the capture period. We used a public dataset (n = 28) of lower limb kinematics captured during a 30-second period of treadmill running at three speeds (2.5m {middle dot} s-1, 3.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 4.5m {middle dot} s-1).  Ground truth values were determined by averaging data across all collected strides and compared to representative means calculated from random samples (1,000 samples) of n (range = 5--30) consecutive gait cycles. We also compared representative means calculated from n (range = 5--15) consecutive gait cycles randomly sampled (1,000 samples) from within the same data capture period. The mean, variance and range of the absolute error of the representative mean compared to the  ground truth mean progressively reduced across all speeds as the number of gait cycles used increased. Similar magnitudes of  error were observed between the 2.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 3.5m {middle dot} s-1 speeds at comparable gait cycle numbers -- where the maximum errors were < 1.5 degrees even with a small number of gait cycles (i.e. 5-10). At the 4.5m {middle dot} s-1 speed, maximum errors typically exceeded 2-4 degrees when a lower number of gait cycles were used. Subsequently, a higher number of gait cycles (i.e. 25-30) was required to achieve low errors (i.e. 1-2 degrees) at the 4.5m {middle dot} s-1 speed. The mean, variance and range of absolute error of representative means calculated from different parts of the capture period was consistent irrespective of the number of gait cycles used. The error between representative means was low (i.e. <1.5 degrees) and consistent across the different number of gait cycles at the 2.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 3.5m {middle dot} s-1 speeds, and consistent but larger (i.e. up to 2-4 degrees) at the 4.5m {middle dot} s-1 speed. Our findings suggest that selecting as many gait cycles as possible from a treadmill running bout will minimise potential  error. Analysing a small sample (i.e. 5-10 cycles) will typically result in minimal  error (i.e. < 2 degrees), particularly at lower speeds (i.e. 2.5m {middle dot} s-1 and 3.5m {middle dot} s-1). Researchers and clinicians should consider the balance between practicalities of collecting and analysing a smaller number of gait cycles against the potential  error when determining their methodological approach. Irrespective of the number of gait cycles used, we recommend that the potential  error introduced by the choice of gait cycle number be considered when interpreting the magnitude of effects in treadmill-based running studies.",

Endocannabinoid mediated changes to excitability are predominantly attributed to 2-arachidonoylglycerol at synapses. Here we identify a pathway in the neocortex by which anandamide, the other major endocannabinoid, powerfully inhibits sodium conductances in the soma resulting in a loss of neuronal excitability. This pathway is mediated by the cannabinoid receptor, and its activation results in a decrease of recurrent action potential generation. The synthetic cannabinoid, WIN 55,212-2, also inhibits VGSC currents indicating this pathway is positioned to mediate the actions of exogenous cannabinoids.\n\nHighlightsAnandamide (AEA), a major endocannabinoid, indirectly inhibits VGSC currents in neocortical neurons.\n\nThis prevalent signaling pathway involves AEA activation of CB1 and other G-protein-coupled receptors localized to the intracellular compartment of neurons.\n\nCB1 activation by AEA reduces VGSC availability at the soma but not at the axonal compartment suggesting tighter functional coupling between VGSCs and CB1 at the cell body.\n\nCannabinoid action on somatic CB1 inhibits VGSCs with high efficacy, providing a parallel pathway outside of nerve terminals, by which these ligands reduce neuronal excitability in the neocortex.",

    "abstract": "The AMPA subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors (AMPARs) plays an essential role in excitatory synaptic transmission, learning, and memory. The majority of AMPARs are made in the cell body and are transported by molecular motors to synapses. Maintaining the proper number of synaptic receptors requires coordinated regulation of receptor production, export from the soma and delivery at synapses. This major logistical process is essential for circuit function and behavior. Although recent studies have shown that long-distance synaptic transport is regulated by neuronal activity, little is known about the mechanisms that coordinate somatic export or synaptic delivery and removal. Here we show that loss of the PTP-3A isoform of the receptor tyrosine phosphatase PTP-3 (the C. elegans homologue of vertebrate LAR-RPTP) leads to a [~]60% decrease in AMPAR transport; this affects synaptic delivery of AMPARs and synaptic functions necessary for long-term associative olfactory memory in C. elegans. Interestingly, while complete loss of PTP-3A leads to defects in transport and local synaptic trafficking of AMPARs, loss of only PTP-3 phosphatase function affects local synaptic recycling and retention of AMPARs. Finally, we show that the N-terminus of PTP-3A regulates transport, whereas the C-terminal regulates synaptic retention of AMPARs. Altogether, our results suggest a model in which the two domains of PTP-3/LAR-RPTPs have specific, complementary roles in coordinating somatic export and local retention of AMPARs essential for long-term associative memory.",

    "abstract": "Evolving behavioral goals require the existence of selection mechanisms that prioritize task-relevant working memory (WM) content for action. Selecting an item stored in WM is known to blunt and/or reverse information loss in stimulus-specific representations of that item reconstructed from human brain activity, but extant studies have focused on all-or-none circumstances that allow or disallow an agent to select one of several items stored in WM. Conversely, behavioral studies suggest that humans can flexibly assign different levels of priority to different items stored in WM, but how doing so influences neural representations of WM content is unclear. One possibility is that assigning different levels of priority to items in WM influences the quality of those representations, resulting in more robust neural representations of high- vs. low-priority WM content. A second - and non-exclusive - possibility is that asymmetries in behavioral priority influence how rapidly neural representations of high- vs. low-priority WM content can be selected and reported. We tested these possibilities in two experiments by decoding high- and low-priority WM content from EEG recordings obtained while human volunteers performed a retrospectively cued WM task. Probabilistic changes in the behavioral relevance of a remembered item had no effect on our ability to decode it from EEG signals; instead, these changes influenced the latency at which above-chance decoding performance was reached. Thus, our results indicate that probabilistic changes in the behavioral relevance of WM content influence the ease with which memories can be accessed and retrieved independently of their strength.",

    "abstract": "The MUS81 complex is crucial for preserving genome stability through resolution of branched DNA intermediates in mitosis and also for the processing of deprotected replication forks in BRCA2-deficient cells. Because of the existence of two different MUS81 complexes in mammalian cells that act in M or S-phase, whether and how the PARPi sensitivity of BRCA2-deficient cells is affected by loss of MUS81 function is unclear.\n\nHere, using a mutant of MUS81 that impairs its function in M-phase, we show that viability of BRCA2-deficient cells but not their PARPi sensitivity requires a fully-functional MUS81 complex in mitosis. In contrast, expression of a constitutively-active MUS81 is sufficient to confer PARPi resistance. From a mechanistic point of view, our data indicates that deregulated action of the mitotic active form of MUS81 in S-phase leads to the cleavage of stalled replication forks before their reversal, bypassing fork deprotection, and engaging a Pol{theta}-dependent DSBs repair.\n\nCollectively, our findings describe a novel mechanism leading to PARPi resistance that involves unscheduled MUS81-dependent cleavage of intact, unreversed replication forks. Since this cleavage occurs mimicking the phosphorylated status of S87 of MUS81, our data suggest that hyperphosphorylation of this residue in S-phase might represent a novel biomarker to identify resistance to PARPi.",

Today, common protocols estimate per-cell mtDNA-molecule numbers by sequencing or qPCR from bulk samples. However, this does not allow insight into cell-to-cell heterogeneity and can mask phenotypical sub-populations. Here, we present mtFociCounter, a single-cell image-analysis tool for reproducible quantification of nucleoids and other foci. mtFociCounter is a light-weight, open-source freeware and overcomes current limitations to reproducible single-cell analysis of mitochondrial foci. We demonstrate its use by analysing 2165 single fibroblasts, and observe a large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in nucleoid numbers. In addition, mtFociCounter quantifies mitochondrial content and our results show good correlation (R=0.90) between nucleoid number and mitochondrial area, and we find nucleoid density is less variable than nucleoid numbers in wild-type cells. Finally, we demonstrate mtFociCounter readily detects differences in foci numbers upon sample-treatment, and applies to superresolution microscopy. Together, we present mtFociCounter as a solution to reproducibly quantify cellular foci in single cells and our results highlight the importance of accounting for cell-to-cell variance and mitochondrial context in mitochondrial nucleoid analysis.",

    "abstract": "An important step towards understanding the mechanistic basis of the central dogma is the quantitative characterization of the dynamics of nucleic-acid-bound molecular motors in the context of the living cell, where a crowded cytoplasm as well as competing and potentially antagonistic processes may significantly affect their rapidity and reliability. To capture these dynamics, we develop a novel method, lag-time analysis, for measuring in vivo dynamics. The approach uses exponential growth as the stopwatch to resolve dynamics in an asynchronous culture and therefore circumvents the difficulties and potential artifacts associated with synchronization or fluorescent labeling. Although lag-time analysis has the potential to be widely applicable to the quantitative analysis of in vivo dynamics, we focus on an important application: characterizing replication dynamics. To benchmark the approach, we analyze replication dynamics in three different species and a collection of mutants. We provide the first quantitative locus-specific measurements of fork velocity, in units of kb per second, as well as replisome-pause durations, some with the precision of seconds. The measured fork velocity is observed to be both locus and time dependent, even in wild-type cells. In addition to quantitatively characterizing known phenomena, we detect brief, locus-specific pauses at rDNA in wild-type cells for the first time. We also observe temporal fork velocity oscillations in three highly-divergent bacterial species. Lag-time analysis not only has great potential to offer new insights into replication, as demonstrated in the paper, but also has potential to provide quantitative insights into other important processes.",

    "abstract": "In order to understand morphogenesis, it is necessary to know the material properties or forces shaping the living tissue. In spite of this need, very few in vivo measurements are currently available. Here, using the early Drosophila embryo as a model, we describe a novel cantilever-based technique which allows for the simultaneous quantification of applied force and tissue displacement in a living embryo. By analyzing data from a series of experiments in which embryonic epithelium is subjected to developmentally relevant perturbations, we conclude that the response to applied force is adiabatic and is dominated by elastic forces and geometric constraints, or system size effects. Crucially, computational modeling of the experimental data indicated that the apical surface of the epithelium must be softer than the basal surface, a result which we confirmed experimentally. Further, we used the combination of experimental data and comprehensive computational model to estimate the elastic modulus of the apical surface and set a lower bound on the elastic modulus of the basal surface. More generally, our investigations revealed important general features that we believe should be more widely addressed when quantitatively modeling tissue mechanics in any system. Specifically, different compartments of the same cell can have very different mechanical properties; when they do, they can contribute differently to different mechanical stimuli and cannot be merely averaged together. Additionally, tissue geometry can play a substantial role in mechanical response, and cannot be neglected.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence indicates crosstalk between the brain and the hematopoietic system following cerebral ischemia. Here, we investigated metabolism and oxygenation in the spleen and spinal cord in a transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) mouse model that is widely used in focal cerebral ischemia research. Naive, sham and tMCAO mice underwent positron emission tomography (PET) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for assessing glucose metabolism and multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) assisted with quantitative model-based reconstruction and unmixing algorithms for accurate mapping of oxygenation patterns in the peripheral tissues at 24 h after reperfusion. We found increased levels of [18F]FDG uptake and reduced MSOT oxygen saturation, indicating hypoxia in the thoracic spinal cord of tMCAO mice compared with sham-operated mice but not in the spleen. A positive correlation was observed between splenic and ipsilateral striatal [18F]FDG uptake. Reduced spleen size was observed in tMCAO mice compared with sham-operated mice ex vivo. tMCAO led to a significant increase in the numbers of mature T cells (CD4 and CD8) in femoral bone marrow tissues, concomitant with a stark reduction in these cell subsets in the spleen and their decrease in peripheral blood. The numbers of mature granulocytes (determined as CD11b+Gr1hi cells) decreased in bone marrow tissues and blood but increased in the spleen. The combination of quantitative PET and MSOT thus enabled the observation of hypoxia and increased metabolic activity in the spinal cord of tMCAO mice at 24 h after occlusion compared to sham-operated mice.",

    "abstract": "The heretical conjecture offered here is that a 3-space scene reconstruction of sequences of visual fixations is constructed directly in V1 in a head-centered frame. \"Direttissima\" is a climbing term designating the shortest, most direct route to the objective of a climb. The \"heresy\" here is the claim that the construction of the first 3D representation of the scene before ones eyes takes place in V1 rather than further up the visual pathways. The inputs to the neural process proposed for such construction are the V1 retinotopic projections from each eye and the vergence angle. Absolute disparities are not encoded as a separate data set in a distinct set of neurons, but rather are emergent properties of the neurons that implement the construction of the 3D representation of one or a sequence of fixations on elements of the scene. In this conjecture, the conscious \"picture\" we take as vision is a projection of the 3D construction, not a view of the retinal image. One of the critical psychophysical clues to the nature of such a mechanism is the well known visual size constancy phenomenon. Another property of the proposed mechanism is that it is plausibly fast enough to enable such spatially and temporally demanding tasks as a human batting a fastball or a bobcat swatting the head of a striking rattlesnake.",

    "abstract": "The development of spatial transcriptomics technologies makes it possible to study tissue heterogeneity at the scale of spatial expressed microenvironment. However, most of the previous methods collapse the spatial patterns in the low spatial resolution. Existing reference based deconvolution methods integrate single-cell reference and spatial transcriptomics data to predict the proportion of cell-types, but the availability of suitable single-cell reference is often limited. In this paper, we propose a novel Transformer based model (TransfromerST) to integrate the spatial gene expression measurements and their spatial patterns in the histology image (if available) without single cell reference. TransfromerST enables the learning of the locally realistic and globally consistent constituents at nearly single cell resolution. TransfromerST firstly uses a transformer based variational autoencoder to explore the latent representation of gene expression, which is further embedded with the spatial relationship learned from adaptive graph Transformer model. The super-resolved cross-scale graph network improves the model-fit to enhanced structure-functional interactions. The public and in-house experimental results with multimodal spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate TransfromerST could highlight the tissue structures at nearly single cell resolution and detect the spatial variable genes and meta gene for each spatial domain. In summary, TransfromerST provides an effective and efficient alternative for spatial transcriptomics tissue clustering, super-resolution and gene expression prediction from histology image.",

Here, using untargeted comparative metabolomics for the analysis of wildtype animals and a series of germline mutants, we show that C. elegans hermaphrodites and males exhibit pervasive metabolomic differences. Several hundred small molecules are produced exclusively or in much larger amounts in one sex, including a host of previously unreported metabolites that incorporate building blocks from nucleoside, carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism. A subset of male-enriched metabolites is specifically associated with the presence of a male germline, whereas enrichment of other compounds requires a male soma. Further, we show that one of the male germline-dependent metabolites, an unusual dipeptide incorporating N,N-dimethyltryptophan, accelerates the last stage of larval development in hermaphrodites. Our results serve as a foundation for mechanistic studies of how the genetic sex of soma and germline shape the C. elegans metabolome and provides a blueprint for the discovery of sex-dependent metabolites in other animals.",

    "abstract": "Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) may be of use for increasing crop yield and plant resilience to biotic and abiotic stressors. Using hyperspectral reflectance data to assess growth-related traits may shed light on the underlying genetics as such data can help assess biochemical and physiological traits. This study aimed to integrate hyperspectral reflectance data with genome-wide association analyses to examine maize growth-related traits under PGPB inoculation. A total of 360 inbred maize lines with 13,826 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were evaluated with and without PGPB inoculation; 150 hyperspectral wavelength reflectances at 386-1,021 nm and 131 hyperspectral indices were used in the analysis. Plant height, stalk diameter, and shoot dry mass were measured manually. Overall, hyperspectral signatures produced similar or higher genomic heritability estimates than those of manually measured phenotypes, and they were genetically correlated with manually measured phenotypes. Furthermore, several hyperspectral reflectance values and spectral indices were identified by genome-wide association analysis as potential markers for growthrelated traits under PGPB inoculation. Eight SNPs were detected, which were associated with manually measured and hyperspectral phenotypes. Moreover, the hyperspectral phenotypes were associated with genes previously reported as candidates for nitrogen uptake efficiency, tolerance to abiotic stressors, and kernel size. In addition, a Shiny web application was developed to explore multi-phenotype genome-wide association results interactively. Taken together, our results demonstrate the usefulness of hyperspectral-based phenotyping for studying maize growth-related traits in response to PGPB inoculation.",

    "abstract": "Using sequences from 2615 UCE loci and multiple methodologies we inferred phylogenies for the largest genetic dataset of New World Myotis to date. The resulting phylogenetic trees were populated with short branch lengths and widespread conflict, hallmarks consistent with rapid adaptive radiations. The degree of conflict observed in Myotis has likely contributed to difficulties disentangling deeper evolutionary relationships. Unlike earlier phylogenies based on 1-2 gene sequences, this UCE dataset places M. brandtii outside the New World clades. Introgression testing of a small subset of our samples revealed evidence of historical but not contemporary gene flow, suggesting that hybridization occurs less frequently in the Neotropics than the Nearctic. We identified several instances of cryptic lineages within described species as well as several instances of potential taxonomic over-splitting. Evidence from Central and South American localities suggests that diversity in those regions is not fully characterized. In light of the accumulated evidence of the evolutionary complexity in Myotis and our survey of the taxonomic implications from our phylogenies it is apparent that the definition of species and regime of species delimitation need to be re-evaluated for Myotis. This will require substantial collaboration and sample sharing between geneticists and taxonomists to build a system that is both robust and applicable in a genus as diverse as Myotis.",

    "abstract": "Cooperation is widespread among microbes. One mechanism proposed to constrain cheating is antagonistic pleiotropy, wherein mutations that cause defection from cooperation, while potentially under positive selection for this effect, reduce fitness at other traits. The bacterium Myxococcus xanthus engages in pleiotropically connected complex multicellular behaviors, including motility, predation, and starvation-induced fruiting-body development. Sporulation during development is susceptible to cheating. Here we investigate pleiotropic impacts on how cheater spores respond to stressful environmental changes after development, relative to cooperator spores. A cheater with a mutation in the developmental-signaling gene asgB shows antagonistic pleiotropy under both heat and basic-pH stress, while a cheater mutated at csgA shows synergistic pleiotropy under basic-pH stress. Further, in a social form of pleiotropy, cooperator spores formed in mixture with the asgB cheater are less resilient under basic pH than those from pure groups; interaction of cooperators with cheaters reduces the cooperators physical robustness. Our results indicate that, depending on the mutation, pleiotropy can promote as well as limit cheating alleles. They additionally demonstrate that alleles can pleiotropically alter traits in organisms not carrying those alleles. Synergistic and social pleiotropy may contribute to shaping the evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and cheating in many social systems.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in long-read sequencing technology have allowed for single-molecule sequencing of entire mitochondrial genomes, opening the door for direct investigation of mitochondrial genome architecture and landscapes of recombination. We used PacBio sequencing to re-assemble mitochondrial genomes from two species of New Zealand freshwater snails, Potamopyrgus antipodarum and Potamopyrgus estuarinus. These assemblies revealed a [~]1.7 kb structure within the mitochondrial genomes of both species that was previously undetected by assembly of short sequencing reads and likely corresponding to a large non-coding region commonly present in mitochondrial genomes. The overall architecture of these Potamopyrgus mitochondrial genomes is reminiscent of the chloroplast genomes of land plants, harboring a large single-copy region (LSC) and a small single-copy region (SSC) separated by a pair of inverted repeats (IRa and IRb). Individual sequencing reads that spanned across the Potamopyrgus IRa-SSC-IRb structure revealed the occurrence of \"flip-flop\" recombination, apparently mediated by the IRs. We also detected evidence for two distinct IR haplotypes and recombination between them in wild-caught P. estuarinus, as well as extensive inter-molecular recombination between SNPs in the LSC region. Together, these observations suggest that mitochondrial inheritance is not strictly maternal in these snails. The chloroplast-like architecture and repeat-mediated mitochondrial recombination we describe here raise fundamental questions regarding the origins and commonness of such architecture, whether and how recombination mediates mitochondrial genome evolution, and the role of genome architecture in driving cytoplasmic genome biology and the maintenance of cytoplasmic genomes.",

This has suggested that the dopamine prediction error may function as a teaching signal, without endowing preceding events with value. We studied the cognitive basis of intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), a setting where dopamine appears to be valuable. Physiological frequencies seen during reinforcement learning did not support robust ICSS or promote behavior that would indicate the stimulation was represented as a meaningful reward in a specific or general sense. This was despite demonstrating that this same physiologically-relevant signal could function as a teaching signal. However, supraphysiological frequencies supported robust ICSS where the stimulation was represented as a specific sensory event, which acted as a goal to motivate behavior. This demonstrates that dopamine neurons only support ICSS at supraphysiological frequencies, and in a manner that does not reflect our subjective experience with endogenous firing of dopamine neurons during reinforcement learning.\n\nOne sentence summaryDopamine neurons only support ICSS at supraphysiological frequencies and in a manner not reflecting dopamines role in learning.",

    "abstract": "A large number of cryptic splice sites in eukaryotic genome are generally dormant unless activated by mutations of authentic splice sites or splicing factors. How cryptic splice sites are used remains unknown in plants. Here, we identified two cryptic splicing regulators, RBP45d and PRP39a that are homologs of yeast U1 auxiliary protein Nam8 and Prp39, respectively, via genetic screening for suppressors of the virescent sot5 mutant, which results from a point mutation at the 5 splice site (5 ss) of intron 7. PCR and DNA sequencing data showed that loss-of-function mutations in RBP45d and PRP39a significantly increase the level of a cryptically spliced mRNA that encodes a mutated but partially functional sot5 protein, rescuing sot5 to the WT phenotype. Yeast two hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays demonstrated that RBP45d and PRP39a interact each other and also with the U1C, a core subunit of U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (U1 snRNP). RNA electronic mobility shift assay showed that RBP45d directly binds to the uridine (U)-rich RNA sequence downstream of the cryptic 5 ss. Consistently, our transcriptomic analysis revealed that a set of introns with U-rich sequences are retained in rbp45d. However, we found that other RBP45/47 members do not function redundantly with RBP45d, at least in regulation of cryptic splicing. Collectively, our data suggest that RBP45d is required for 5 ss selection via binding to intronic U-rich elements and PRP39a in plants.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe Arabidopsis RBP45d interacting with U1C and PRP39a is required for 5 ss selection via binding to intronic U-rich elements.",

Glucose utilization in the retinorecipient superior colliculus (SC) is one of the highest in the brain. Since metabolic support to neurons is a major function of astrocytes, they could be of particular relevance in this region and display specific features. However, little is known about astrocytes and their interactions with neurons in this multisensory brain area. We thus here investigated region-specific cellular and structural properties of astrocytes in the visual layer of the SC. Using morphological reconstructions, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and superresolution imaging, we found that astrocytes from the visual layers of the SC are highly distinct with a higher cellular density, a more complex morphology and a stronger proximity to synapses compared to astrocytes from the primary visual cortex and the hippocampus. These data point to astroglial diversity and specialization within neural circuits integrating sensory information in the adult brain.",

We here identify and characterize an amphipathic helix in Ccz1, which is required for the function of Mon-Ccz1 in autophagy, but not endosomal maturation. Furthermore, our data show that the interaction of the Ccz1 amphipathic helix with lipid packing defects, binding of Mon1 basic patches to positively charged lipids and association of MC1 with recruiter proteins collectively govern membrane recruitment of the complex in a synergistic and redundant manner. The data demonstrate that specific protein and lipid cues convey the differential targeting of MC1 to endosomes and autophagosomes.

In bacteria, DinB enzymes are widely distributed promutagenic translesion polymerases. The role of DinBs in mycobacterial mutagenesis was unclear until recent studies revealed a role for mycobacterial DinB1 in substitution and frameshift mutagenesis, overlapping with that of translesion polymerase DnaE2. M. smegmatis encodes two additional DinBs (DinB2 and DinB3) and M. tuberculosis encodes DinB2, but the roles of these polymerases in mycobacterial damage tolerance and mutagenesis is unknown. The biochemical properties of DinB2, including facile utilization of ribonucleotides and 8-oxo-guanine, suggest that DinB2 could be a promutagenic polymerase. Here we examine the effects of DinB2 and DinB3 overexpression in mycobacterial cells. We demonstrate that DinB2 can drive diverse substitution mutations conferring antibiotic resistance. DinB2 induces frameshift mutations in homopolymeric sequences, both in vitro and in vivo. DinB2 switches from less to more mutagenic in the presence of manganese in vitro. This study indicates that DinB2 may contribute to mycobacterial mutagenesis and antibiotic resistance acquisition in combination with DinB1 and DnaE2.",

A pot experiment with 40 varieties was conducted under well water, drought and flooding stresses. A multivariate analysis method of principal component analysis, comprehensive evaluation value, correlation analysis, stepwise regression analysis, and cluster analysis was used to evaluate the resistance of maize. Most varieties had stronger drought resistance rather than flooding resistance because of the higher antioxidant enzyme activities, osmotic adjustment substances, less reactive oxygen species, and a greater than 1.0 drought-resistance coefficient. However, there was an increment of reactive oxygen species (especially O2-), ascorbate peroxidase, peroxidase, soluble sugar, and the decrement of superoxide dismutase, catalase, soluble protein, and a lower than 1.0 of flooding-resistance coefficient of most maize varieties in flooding stress compared with well water. The superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, proline, soluble sugar and protein, plant height, leaf area/plant, and stem diameter were screened out to be accurate and representative indicators to evaluate the drought and flooding resistance of maize.

In the weak mutation regime, while the mean steady-state fitness increases with population size, we find that the height of the first fitness peak encountered when starting from a random genotype displays various behaviors versus population size, even among small and simple rugged landscapes. We show that the accessibility of the different fitness peaks is key to determining whether this height overall increases or decreases with population size. Furthermore, there is often a finite population size that maximizes the height of the first fitness peak encountered when starting from a random genotype. This holds across various classes of model rugged landscapes with sparse peaks, and in some experimental and experimentally-inspired ones. Thus, early adaptation in rugged fitness landscapes can be more efficient and predictable for relatively small population sizes than in the large-size limit.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFungal specialized metabolites include many bioactive compounds with potential applications as pharmaceuticals, agrochemical agents, and industrial chemicals. Exploring and discovering novel fungal metabolites is critical to combat antimicrobial resistance in various fields, including medicine and agriculture. Yet, identifying the conditions or treatments that will trigger the production of specialized metabolites in fungi can be cumbersome since most of these metabolites are not produced under standard culture conditions. Here, we introduce a data-driven algorithm comprising various network analysis routes to characterize the production of known and putative specialized metabolites and unknown analytes triggered by different exogenous compounds. We use bipartite networks to quantify the relationship between the metabolites and the treatments stimulating their production through two routes. The first, called the direct route, determines the production of known and putative specialized metabolites induced by a treatment. The second, called the auxiliary route, is specific for unknown analytes. We demonstrated the two routes by applying chitooligosaccharides and lipids at two different temperatures to the opportunistic human fungal pathogen Aspergillus fumigatus. We used various network centrality measures to rank the treatments based on their ability to trigger a broad range of specialized metabolites. The specialized metabolites were ranked based on their receptivity to various treatments. Altogether, our data-driven techniques can track the influence of any exogenous treatment or abiotic factor on the metabolomic output for targeted metabolite research. This approach can be applied to complement existing LC/MS analyses to overcome bottlenecks in drug discovery and development from fungi.\n\nNoticeThis manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the US Department of Energy (DOE).

We also provide a \"auxiliary route\" to distinguish unique unknown analytes amongst the abundantly produced analytes in response to these treatments. The developed techniques can assist researchers to identify treatments or applications that could positively influence the production of a targeted metabolite or recognize unique unknown analytes that can be further fractionated, characterized, and screened for their biological activities and hence, discover new metabolites.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigates the bioremediation of waste engine oil at both dissolved or being suspended in oily wastewater using an actinobacterium, Gordonia terrae DSM 43249 strain isolated from East Kolkata wetlands. The isolated strain was found capable of sustaining in highly toxic oil contaminated wastewater and simultaneously can efficiently biodegrade the pollutants in both simulated fresh and marine water system at optimized environmental conditions. Moreover, in order to understand the effect of physical presence of oil in oily wastewater on the bioremediation process, three types of simulated oil-water forms were studied: water with free waste engine oil, oil-water mixture in the form of coarse emulsion and microemulsion. It was observed that the percentage degradation became maximum with the microemulsion form (72.73%) followed by the coarse one (65.45%). The minimum percentage degradation of 39.74% was seen with the free oil. Statistical interpretation also revalidates the experimental observations, showing that the oil percentage degradation is much sensitive to the oil and water composition in an oily-water system (F=772.64> Fcritical =5.143). Hence, it is presumed from the present study that such a high percentage degradation of oil especially, when oil is thoroughly mixed with water, can be considered as one of the potential applications for oil treatment such as during oil spillage using G.terrae DSM 43249.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/503898v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (69K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@154b649org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8b86cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3e8f3forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12e88d1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The environmental pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans claims over 180,000 lives each year. Survival of this basidiomycete at host CO2 concentrations has only recently been considered an important virulence trait. Through screening gene knockout libraries constructed in a CO2-tolerant clinical strain, we found mutations leading to CO2 sensitivity are enriched in pathways activated by heat stress, including calcineurin, Ras1-Cdc24, cell wall integrity, and Regulator of Ace2 and Morphogenesis (RAM). Overexpression of Cbk1, the conserved terminal kinase of the RAM pathway, partially restored defects of these mutants at host CO2 or temperature levels. In ascomycetes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans, transcription factor Ace2 is an important target of Cbk1, activating genes responsible for cell separation. However, no Ace2 homolog or any downstream component of the RAM pathway has been identified in basidiomycetes. Through in vitro evolution and comparative genomics, we characterized mutations in suppressors of cbk1{Delta} in C. neoformans that partially rescued defects in CO2 tolerance, thermotolerance, and morphology. One suppressor is the RNA translation repressor Ssd1, which is highly conserved in ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. The other is a novel ribonuclease domain-containing protein, here named PSC1, which is present in basidiomycetes and humans but surprisingly absent in most ascomycetes. Loss of Ssd1 in cbk1{Delta} partially restored cryptococcal ability to survive and amplify in the inhalation and intravenous murine models of cryptococcosis. Our discoveries highlight the overlapping regulation of CO2 tolerance and thermotolerance, the essential role of the RAM pathway in cryptococcal adaptation to the host condition, and the potential importance of post-transcriptional control of virulence traits in this global pathogen.",

Classically, MRA requires the solution of a linear system and results are sensitive to noise in the data and perturbation intensities. Applications to networks of 10 nodes or more are difficult due to noise propagation.\n\nResultsWe propose a new formulation of MRA as a multilinear regression problem. This enables to integrate all the replicates and potential, additional perturbations in a larger, over determined and more stable system of equations. More relevant confidence intervals on network parameters can be obtained and we show competitive performance for networks of size up to 100. Prior knowledge integration in the form of known null edges further improves these results.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe R code used to obtain the presented results is available from GitHub: https://github.com/J-P-Borg/BioInformatics\n\nContactPatrice.ravel@umontpellier.fr",

    "abstract": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) exert beneficial effects on health by regulating innate immunity in the intestinal tract. Many LAB that demonstrate anti-viral properties depend on the hosts inflammatory responses; however, a few LAB strains have low inflammatory and anti-viral properties. In this study, the LAB strain D279 (NITE_BP-03645, Latilactobacillus sakei) was isolated from among 741 LAB strains that were analyzed for their ability to induce interleukin 12 (IL-12), and was subsequently characterized. D279 induced the highest levels of IL-12 among the screened LAB. Further, D279 significantly activated anti-viral genes and preferentially induced IFN{lambda} in vitro, which plays a critical role in the epithelial tissue, conferring strong anti-influenza potency without inflammation, whereas IFN levels were relatively lower. Administration of pasteurized D279 to mice resulted in strong anti-influenza potency, including higher natural killer (NK) cell activity, and a reduced number of viruses in the lung compared to the control. Importantly, no D279-fed mice were sacrificed during the viral infection tests. Taken together, these results suggest that D279 administration confers beneficial effects with reduced inflammation, regulates innate immunity, and may be relevant for commercial use in the future.",

    "abstract": "The pervasive association of demosponges with diverse bacterial communities has been a research topic since the late 1970s. Studies characterizing these bacterial communities have detected over 40 bacterial phyla associated with sponges and determined that sponge microbiomes differ from the bacterioplankton of the surrounding water and include sponges-specific bacterial associates. Despite the large body of information available on the diversity of the sponge microbiome, the molecular mechanisms used by sponges to interact with their bacterial symbionts and vice versa remain poorly understood. Yet, studying how sponges interact with their microbiomes is pivotal to understanding how these systems react to environmental changes and when these changes lead to a disruption of sponge-microbe associations. An important factor hampering the characterization of the sponge-microbiome molecular cross-talk mechanisms is the lack of broadly applicable molecular methods to, for instance, efficiently sequence meta-transcriptomes across a broad range of sponge species. To overcome this limitation, we implemented a hybrid-capture strategy capable of depleting both sponge and bacterial rRNA from total RNA extracts of highly divergent demosponges with microbiomes of different complexity. Our pan-demosponge rRNA depletion strategy allows for the efficient characterization of the metatranscriptome of diverse demosponge holobionts and the simultaneous quantification of gene expression in both the host and its microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have become an increasingly successful class of anticancer therapy, particularly within the past few years. Though ADCs are in clinical trials for colorectal cancer (CRC), a candidate has yet to be approved. CRC continues to be a leading cause of cancer-related death, emphasizing the need to identify novel target antigens for ADC development. GPR56, a member of the 7TM receptor family, is upregulated in colorectal tumors compared to normal tissues and located on the surface of CRC cells, making it a promising ADC target. Furthermore, high GPR56 expression occurs in tumors that are microsatellite stable, negative for the CpG methylator phenotype, and show chromosomal instability. We previously reported the generation of a high affinity GPR56-specific monoclonal antibody, 10C7, and we have now mapped the epitope to the C-terminal end of the extracellular domain, proximal to the GPCR proteolysis site. Here, we describe the development of a duocarmycin-conjugated 10C7 ADC. 10C7 co-internalized with GPR56 and trafficked to the lysosomes of CRC cells, which is critical for efficient ADC payload release. Evaluation of the ADC in a panel of CRC cell lines and tumor organoids with different levels of GPR56 expression showed the ADC selectively induced cytotoxicity at low nanomolar concentrations in a GPR56-dependent manner. A nontargeting control ADC showed minimal to no activity. Furthermore, GPR56 ADC exhibited significant antitumor efficacy against GPR56-expressing patient-derived xenograft models of CRC. This study provides rationale for the development of a GPR56-targeted ADC approach to potentially treat a large fraction of CRC patients.",

    "abstract": "The sensitivity of reef-building coral to elevated temperature is a function of their symbiosis with dinoflagellate algae in the family Symbiodiniaceae. Changes in the composition of the endosymbiont community in response to thermal stress can increase coral thermal tolerance. Consequently, this mechanism is being investigated as a human-assisted intervention for rapid acclimation of coral in the face of climate change. Successful establishment of novel symbioses that increase coral thermal tolerance have been demonstrated in laboratory conditions; however, it is unclear how long these heterologous relationships persist in nature. Here, we show that Acropora palmata can form a novel symbiosis with Durusdinium spp. when reared in land-based aquaria. We tested the stability of this heterologous relationship by outplanting clonal replicates (ramets) of five A. palmata host genotypes to natural reefs in the lower Florida Keys. Amplicon sequencing analysis of ITS2-type profiles revealed that the majority of surviving ramets remained dominated by Durusdinium spp. two years after transplantation. However, 15% of ramets, including representatives of all genotypes, did exhibit some degree of symbiont shuffling or switching at six of eight sites, including complete takeover by site-specific strains of the native symbiont, Symbiodinium fitti. The predominant long-term stability of the novel symbiosis supports the potential effectiveness of symbiont modification as a management tool. However, the finding that 6-7 year-old coral can alter symbiont community composition in the absence of bleaching indicates that Symbiodiniaceae communities are indeed capable of greater flexibility under ambient conditions.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have shown the tumor extracellular matrix (ECM) associates with immunosuppression, and that targeting the ECM can improve immune infiltration and immunotherapy response. A question that remains is whether the ECM is directly educating the immune phenotypes seen in cancer. We identified a tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) population correlated with poor prognosis, interruption of the cancer immunity cycle, and tumor ECM composition. To investigate whether ECM was capable of generating the TAM phenotype seen, we developed a decellularized tissue model that retains the native ECM architecture and composition. Macrophages cultured on decellularized ovarian metastasis shared transcriptional profiles with the TAMs found in human tissues. ECM educated macrophages have a tissue remodeling and immunoregulatory phenotype, inducing altered T cell function. We conclude that the tumor ECM is directly educating this macrophage population found in cancer tissues. Therefore, current and emerging cancer therapies that target the tumor ECM may be tailored to improve macrophage phenotype and their downstream regulation of immunity.",

    "abstract": "Pericentromeric regions of human chromosomes are composed of tandem-repeated and highly organized sequences named satellite DNAs. Although being known for a long time as the most AT-rich fraction of the human genome, classical satellite HSAT1 has been disregarded in genomic and transcriptional studies, falling behind other human satellites in terms of knowledge. The path followed herein trails with HSAT1 isolation and cloning, followed by in silico analysis. Monomer copy number and expression data was obtained in a wide variety of human cell lines, with greatly varying profiles in tumoral/non-tumoral samples. HSAT1 was mapped in human chromosomes and applied in in situ transcriptional assays. Additionally, it was possible to observe the nuclear organization of HSAT1 transcripts and further characterize them by 3 RACE-Seq. Size-varying polyadenylated HSAT1 transcripts were detected, which possibly accounts for the intricate regulation of alternative polyadenylation. As far as we know, this work pioneers HSAT1 transcription studies. With the emergence of new human genome assemblies, acrocentric pericentromeres are becoming relevant characters in disease and other biological contexts. HSAT1 sequences and associated noncoding RNAs will most certainly prove significant in the future of HSAT research.",

    "abstract": "The presence of immunosuppressive immune cells in cancer is a significant barrier to the generation of therapeutic immune responses. Similarly, in vivo triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) models often contain prevalent tumor-associated macrophages in the tumor microenvironment (TME), resulting in breast cancer initiation, invasion, and metastasis by generating immunosuppressive environment. Here, we test systemic chemoimmunotherapy using small-molecule agents, paclitaxel (PTX), and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) inhibitor, PLX3397, to enhance the adaptive T cell immunity against TNBCs in immunocompetent mouse TNBC models. PTX and PLX3397 are very poorly soluble in water and shown poor therapeutic outcomes in TNBC animal models in conventional formulation. To address the challenge for the delivery of insoluble drugs to TNBC, we use high-capacity poly(2-oxazoline) (POx)-based polymeric micelles to greatly improve the solubility and widen the therapeutic index of such drugs. The results demonstrate that high-dose PTX in POx, even as a single agent, exerts strong effects on TME and induces the long-term immune memory. In addition, we demonstrate that the PTX and PLX3397 combination provides consistent therapeutic improvement across several TNBC models, resulting from the repolarization of the immunosuppressive TME and enhanced T cell immune response that suppress both the primary tumor growth and metastasis. Overall, the work emphasizes the benefit of drug reformulation and outlines potential translational path for both PTX and PTX with PLX3397 combination therapy using POx polymeric micelles for the treatment of TNBC.",
