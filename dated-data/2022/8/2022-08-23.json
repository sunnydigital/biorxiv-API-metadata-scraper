There is little consensus on which of the available estimators works best across taxa and regions. Until now no work compared existing algorithms with multiple datasets encompassing contrasting scenarios.\nC_LIO_LIWe used data from 62 inventories worldwide at different spatial scales, including 20 vertebrate, 22 invertebrate and 20 plant datasets, and compared the accuracy of the most used non-parametric estimators (Chao and Jackknife) and improvements to their original formulations.\nC_LIO_LIOur results highlight the good performance of the Jackknife estimators for incidence data, especially the P-corrected first order jackknife estimator (Jack1inP). This algorithm ranked most often the best or among the best performing estimators using two measures of accuracy that measure deviation from expectation along the accumulation curve.\nC_LIO_LIWe argue that Jack1inP can be considered a universal estimator for species richness, regardless of taxon, temporal and spatial scales, or completeness of the sampling. More research should however be directed towards finding the precise contexts when each estimator might perform best.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Human-wildlife conflict (HWC) at the fringes of protected areas is a major concern in the conservation biology. Although damage caused by carnivores and herbivores may vary in their magnitude, more attention has been given to carnivores due to various reasons. In Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) we compared economic dependence of locals on agriculture and livestock independently and found that income from livestock is only additional, whereas agriculture is the major source of livelihood. We also studied the relative abundance of wild herbivores and diet of tiger, leopard and sloth bear and found that these carnivores have largely been dependent on chital, nilgai and wild pig despite livestock population being higher. We found HWC mitigation in TATR effective but biased towards big cats while the damage in main livelihood (agriculture) being higher. We recommend higher attention to crop-raiding problem for the successful wildlife conservation in central India.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating how the plant species respond to variable light conditions is essential to understand the ecological adaptation to heterogeneous environments. Plant performance and gene regulatory network underpinning the adaptation have been well-documented in sun-grown species. In this study, we surveyed phenotypic and transcriptomic features of four shade-grown and one sun-grown woody species of the family Araliaceae under distinct light conditions. Our phenotypic comparisons demonstrate that the four shade-grown species possess lower light saturation point and higher assimilation ability of the net photosynthetic rate compared to the sun-grown species. In particular, the four shade-grown species maintain similar photosynthesis efficiency in both highlight and lowlight conditions. However, a significantly decreased photosynthesis rate was observed under lowlight condition of the sun-grown species compared to highlight condition. In addition, our leaf anatomical analyses reveal that while all the five species show different anatomical structures under distinct light conditions, the shade-grown species possess lower degree of phenotypic plasticity relative the sun-grown species. Further comparisons of the transcriptome profiling show that all the five species exhibit gene expression divergence among different light conditions. The differentially expressed genes identified in the five species are functionally related to photosynthesis, secondary metabolites and other basic metabolisms. More importantly, differential regulation of the photosynthesis- and photomorphogenesis-related genes are potentially correlated with the phenotypic responses to distinct light conditions of the five species. Our study provides new insights on how the sun- and shade-grown woody species respond to shade and sunlight environments.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk score (PRS) has been widely used to identify the high-risk individuals from the general population, which would be helpful for disease prevention and early treatment. Many methods have been developed to calculate PRS by weighted aggregating the phenotype-associated risk alleles from genome-wide association studies. However, only considering genetic effects may not be sufficient for risk prediction because the disease risk is not only related to genetic factors but also non-genetic factors, e.g., diet, physical exercise et al. But it is still a challenge to integrate these genetic and non-genetic factors into a unified machine learning framework for disease risk prediction. In this paper, we proposed PRSIMD (PRS Integrating Multi-source Data), a machine learning model that applies posterior regularization to integrate genetic and non-genetic factors to improve disease risk prediction. Also, we applied Mendelian Randomization analysis to identify the causal non-genetic risk factors for the selected diseases. We applied PRSIMD to predict type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease from UK Biobank and observed that PRSIMD was significantly better than the methods to calculate PRS including p-value threshold (P+T), PRSice2, SBLUP, DMSLMM, and LDpred2. In addition, we observed that PRSIMD achieved the better predictive power than the composite risk score.",

    "abstract": "The Key participants in the calcium signaling process in the malaria parasite are calcium dependent protein kinases. It has been established that Plasmodium falciparum calcium dependent protein kinase 1 (PfCDPK1) is essential for the invasion of host erythrocytes as well as for the parasites asexual development. Due to malarias resistance to currently available anti-malarial medications, it has become necessary to create effective inhibitory agents that target invasion-dependent proteins. In this study, libraries of 856 chemicals were screened using a variety of computational methods. Physicochemical property testing, molecular docking analysis, and pharmacokinetic ADMET profiling were used to determine these drugs capacity to inhibit PfCDPK1. 88 of the 856 compounds derived from known antimalarial botanicals and clinically approved antimalarial drug pharmacophores have demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect on PfCDPK1. Additionally, based on research done on the purported inhibitory standard of PfCDPK1 (Purfalcamine), which had a binding affinity of -8.8 KJ/mol, twelve compounds, which include 17-hydroxyazadiradione, Nimbaflavone, Dehydrocarpaine-II, Picracin, Epicatechin gallate, and Naringin, ZINC000012504271, ZINCC000100029905, ZINC000004149268, ZINC000078832372, ZINC000102739374 and ZINC000198562314 had exhibited better binding affinities (-8.8, -8.8, -9.2, -9.1, -9.3, -10.0, -8.1, -7.9, -7.9, -8.2, -8.3, -7.9 KJ/mol respectively), pharmacokinectics, and physicochemical properties. According to our findings, 88 compounds are likely pharmacological targets with domiciled PfCDPK1 inhibitory effects. Nevertheless, our findings highlight these twelve stand-out compounds, suggesting that they may be the best candidates with regard to therapeutic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Creating large-scale public datasets of human motion biomechanics could unlock data-driven breakthroughs in our understanding of human motion, neuromuscular diseases, and assistive devices. However, the manual effort currently required to process motion capture data is costly and limits the collection and sharing of large-scale biomechanical datasets. We present a method to automate and standardize motion capture data processing: bilevel optimization that is able to scale the body segments of a musculoskeletal model, register the locations of optical markers placed on an experimental subject to the markers on a musculoskeletal model, and compute body segment kinematics given trajectories of experimental markers during a motion. The optimization requires less than five minutes of computation to process a subjects motion capture data, compared with about one day of manual work for a human expert. On a sample of 34 trials of experimental data, the root-mean-square marker reconstruction error (RMSE) was 1.38 cm, approximately 40% lower than the 2.58 cm achieved manually by 3 experts. Optimization solutions reconstructed known joint angle trajectories from four diverse motion trials of synthetic data to an average of 0.79 degrees RMSE. We have published an open source cloud service at AddBiomechanics.org to process experimental motion capture data, which is available at no cost and asks that users agree to share processed and de-identified data with the community. Reducing the barriers to processing and sharing high-quality human motion biomechanics data will enable more people to engage in state-of-the-art biomechanical analysis in their work, do so at lower cost, and share larger and more accurate datasets.\n\nAuthor summaryCreating large-scale public datasets of human motion could unlock data-driven breakthroughs in our understanding of neuromuscular diseases, assistive devices, and human motion more broadly. The manual effort currently required to process these motion datasets is costly and limits the collection and sharing of large-scale datasets. Our cloud-based software tool, called AddBiomechanics, uses state-of-the-art optimization techniques to automatically scale the body segments of a musculoskeletal model to match the subject of interest, and then compute body segment kinematics during a motion. The optimization requires less than five minutes of computation to process a subjects motion capture data, compared with about one day of manual work for a human expert. The accuracy of the approach in quantifying the body segment kinematics is as good or better than the results achieved manually by experts. Reducing the barriers to processing and sharing high-quality human motion biomechanics data will enable more people to engage in state-of-the-art biomechanical analysis, do so at lower cost, and share larger and more accurate datasets.",

In this study, we evaluate the phylogeny of the subtribe Cenchrinae using parsimony, likelihood, and Bayesian inference based on the plastid marker ndhF and increasing the number of sampled species. Our main objective was analyze American taxa with inflorescences of the \"Paspalidium type\" (i.e., subgenera Paurochaetium and Reverchoniae) to test whether they, as traditionally circumscribed, form a natural group. Our findings recovered both subgenera as polyphyletic, with their species distributed in different morphologically distinctive clades and not necessarily correlated with the geographic origin. Additionally, we were able to include a second voucher of species that were imprecisely located in previous studies and define their placements in the tree, as well as confirm that Setaria is polyphyletic as currently delineated. A comparison with the results from other studies, comments on Stenotaphrum Trin. and a brief discussion on conflicting placements in the \"Cenchrus clade\", and of Acritochaete Pilg. are also included here.",

    "abstract": "Kinematic analyses of rodent behavior are frequently used in neuroscience research, and commonly in spinal cord injury (SCI) studies. Unfortunately, skin motion artifact introduces significant errors into these data, because the skin is only loosely coupled to the underlying skeleton by connective tissue. In rats, these errors can be as large as 50-75%,as quantified by past work using x-ray fluoroscopy. Here we show that infrared videography of a subcutaneous tattoo can overcome skin motion artifact in rodent kinematics. The method yields data similar to gold standard x-ray fluoroscopy systems at a fraction of the cost, does not affect the animals locomotion, and results in markers that persist for at least 10 weeks. We found that, compared to a gold-standard x-ray fluoroscopy study that directly tracked the skeleton, our method reduced the error in mean hip angle from 17 {+/-} 6.0 to 3.1 {+/-} 2.4 degrees (mean {+/-} SEM), and the root-mean-square (RMS) error across the mean hip angle waveform from 20 to 5.3 degrees (n=4 rats). The knee joint angle waveform derived from infra-red imaging tightly matched the shape of the x-ray waveform after allowing for a constant offset, having RMS error reduced from 8.1 to 1.2 degrees. The method stands to significantly reduce between-animal errors, and hence between laboratory errors, in these ubiquitous model systems, especially important in SCI studies where individuals are assigned to different treatments.",

    "abstract": "Oomycete pathogens can secret hundreds of effectors into plant cells to interfere with plant immune system during infection. Here we identified a cytoplasmic RXLR effector from the most destructive pathogen of litchi, Peronophythora litchii, and named it as PlAvh202. PlAvh202 could suppress cell death triggered by INF1 and Avr3a/R3a in Nicotiana benthamiana, and was essential for P. litchii virulence. In addition, PlAvh202 also suppressed plant immune responses and promoted the susceptibility of N. benthamiana to Phytophthora capsici. Further research revealed that PlAvh202 could suppress ethylene (ET) production by targeting and destabilizing plant S-adenosyl-L-methionine synthetase (SAMS), a key enzyme in ET biosynthesis pathway, in a 26S proteasome-dependent manner. Transient expression of LcSAMS3 induced ET production and enhanced plant resistance, whereas inhibition of ET biosynthesis promoted P. litchii infection, supporting that LcSAMS and ET positively regulate litchi immunity towards P. litchii. Overall, these findings highlight that SAMS can be targeted by oomycete RXLR effector to manipulate ET-mediated plant immunity.",

Experiments measured the decrease in the airborne viable MS2 concentration in the presence of different concentrations of GP from 60 to 90 minutes, accounting for both natural die-off and settling of MS2. Experiments were conducted both by introducing GP aerosol into air containing MS2 and by introducing airborne MS2 into air containing GP aerosol. GP is consistently able to rapidly reduce viable MS2 bacteriophage concentration by 2-3 logs at GP concentrations of 0.02 mg/m3 to 0.5 mg/m3 (corresponding to TEG concentrations of 0.012 mg/m3 to 0.287 mg/m3).

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), emerged in late 2019 in Wuhan, China and its rapid global spread has resulted in millions of deaths. An important public health consideration is the potential for SARS-CoV-2 to establish endemicity in a secondary animal reservoir outside of Asia or acquire adaptations that result in new variants with the ability to evade the immune response and reinfect the human population. Previous work has shown that North American deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) are susceptible and can transmit SARS-CoV-2 to naive conspecifics, indicating its potential to serve as a wildlife reservoir for SARS-CoV-2 in North America. In this study, we report experimental SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility of two additional subspecies of the North American deer mouse and two additional deer mouse species, with infectious virus and viral RNA present in oral swabs and lung tissue of infected deer mice and neutralizing antibodies present at 15 days post-challenge. Moreover, some of one species, the California mouse (P. californicus) developed clinical disease, including one that required humane euthanasia. California mice often develop spontaneous liver disease, which may serve as a comorbidity for SARS-CoV-2 severity. The results of this study suggest broad susceptibility of rodents in the genus Peromyscus and further emphasize the potential of SARS-CoV-2 to infect a wide array of North American rodents.\n\nImportanceA significant concern is the spillback of SARS-CoV-2 into North American wildlife species. We have determined that several species of peromyscine rodents, the most abundant mammals in North America, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and that infection is likely long enough that the virus may be able to establish persistence in local rodent populations. Strikingly, some California mice developed clinical disease that suggests this species may be useful for the study of human co-morbidities often associated with severe and fatal COVID-19 disease.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from Wuhan, China, in December 2019 raised a global health concern that eventually became a pandemic affecting almost all countries worldwide. The respiratory disease has infected over 530 million people worldwide, with over 950,000 deaths recorded. This has led scientists to focus their efforts on understanding the virus to develop effective means to diagnose, treat, prevent, and control this pandemic. One of the areas of focus is isolation of this virus, which plays a crucial role in understanding the viral dynamics in the laboratory. In this study, we report the isolation and detection of locally circulating SARS-CoV-2 in Kenya. The isolates were cultured on Vero Cercopithecus cell line (CCL-81) cells, RNA extraction conducted from the supernatants, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Genome sequencing was done to profile the strains phylogenetically and identify novel and previously reported mutations. Vero CCL-81 cells were able to support the growth of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and mutations were detected from the two isolates sequenced (001 and 002). These virus isolates will be expanded and made available to the Kenya Ministry of Health and other research institutions to advance SARS-CoV-2 research in Kenya and the region.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is caused by a type of coronavirus that emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and later spread to almost all countries. Many countries are still finding ways to contain it. The virus has been studied in many ways to investigate its origin, infectivity, and evolution. Different variants of the virus have emerged and spread, causing a lot of concern as to whether the pandemic will end soon. Significant studies have proven the ability of the virus to grow in the laboratory using cell lines that offer the necessary conditions. Therefore, this study sought to find out the growth of the virus in specific monkey cell line and the variant circulating within the Kenyan population. We found that the selected cell lines supported viral growth outside a human host system. In addition, the circulating virus was found to have evolved to enhance its survival mechanism. This is the first study in Kenya to report this viruss isolation, culture, and identification in monkey kidney cells. These cells supported the growth of the virus in the laboratory and analysing the genome of the growth products showed the virus was related to previously reported strains with multiple changes in its whole DNA sequence.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in Cryo-EM led to a surge of ribosome structures deposited over the past years, including structures from different species, conformational states, or bound with different ligands. Yet, multiple conflicts of nomenclature make the identification and comparison of structures and ortholog components challenging. We present RiboXYZ (available at https://ribosome.xyz), a database that provides organized access to ribosome structures, with several tools for visualisation and study. The database is up-to-date with the Protein Data Bank (PDB) but provides a standardized nomenclature that allows for searching and comparing ribosomal components (proteins, RNA, ligands) across all the available structures. In addition to structured and simplified access to the data, the application has several specialized visualization tools, including the identification and prediction of ligand binding sites, and 3D superimposition of ribosomal components. Overall, RiboXYZ provides a useful toolkit that complements the PDB database, by implementing the current conventions and providing a set of auxiliary tools that have been developed explicitly for analyzing ribosome structures. This toolkit can be easily accessible by both experts and non-experts in structural biology so that they can search, visualize and compare structures, with various potential applications in molecular biology, evolution, and biochemistry.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGrouping samples with low prevalence of positives into pools and testing these pools can achieve considerable savings in testing resources compared with individual testing in the context of COVID-19. We review published pooling matrices, which encode the assignment of samples into pools and describe decoding algorithms, which decode individual samples from pools. Based on the findings we propose new one-round pooling designs with high compression that can efficiently be decoded by combinatorial algorithms. This expands the admissible parameter space for the construction of pooling matrices compared to current methods.\n\nResultsBy arranging samples in a grid and using polynomials to construct pools, we develop direct formulas for an Algorithm (Polynomial Pools (PP)) to generate assignments of samples into pools. Designs from PP guarantee to correctly decode all samples with up to a specified number of positive samples. PP includes recent combinatorial methods for COVID-19, and enables new constructions that can result in more effective designs.\n\nConclusionFor low prevalences of COVID-19, group tests can save resources when compared to individual testing. Constructions from the recent literature on combinatorial methods have gaps with respect to the designs that are available. We develop a method (PP), which generalizes previous constructions and enables new designs that can be advantageous in various situations.",

Here we demonstrate that CasDinG from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain 83 is an ATP- and metal-dependent 5-3 DNA helicase. The crystal structure of CasDinG reveals a helicase core of two RecA-like domains with three accessory domains (N-terminal, arch, and vestigial FeS). To examine the in vivo function of these CasDinG domains, we first identified the preferred PAM sequence (5-GNAWN-3 on the 5-side of the target) with a plasmid library containing all combinations of the five nucleotides upstream of the target sequence. Plasmid clearance assays (using a 5-GGAAA-3 PAM) with CasDinG domain mutants demonstrated the vFeS and arch accessory domains are both essential for type IV immunity. These results provide a needed structural and biochemical framework for understanding the type IV-A CRISPR system.",

Current GECIs face the challenge of sub-optimal peak signal-to-baseline-ratio (SBR) with limited resolution for reporting subtle calcium transients. We report herein the development of a suite of calcium sensors, designated NEMO, with fast kinetics and wide dynamic ranges (>100-fold). NEMO indicators report Ca2+ transients with peak SBRs ~20-fold larger than the top-of-the-range GCaMP series. NEMO sensors further enable the quantification of absolution calcium concentration with ratiometric or photochromic imaging. Compared to GCaMPs, NEMOs could detect single action potentials in neurons with a peak SBR two times higher and a median peak SBR four times larger in vivo, thereby outperforming most existing state-of-the-art GECIs. Given their high sensitivity and resolution to report intracellular Ca2+ signals, NEMO sensors may find broad applications in monitoring neuronal activities and other Ca2+-modulated physiological processes in both mammals and plants.",

In order to advance the use of engineered electroactive bacteria, it is important to demonstrate functional expression of electron transfer modules in chassis adapted to operationally relevant conditions, such as non-freshwater environments. Here, we use the Shewanella oneidensis electron transfer pathway to induce current production in a marine bacterium, Marinobacter atlanticus, during biofilm growth in artificial seawater. Genetically encoded sensors optimized for use in E. coli were used to control protein expression in planktonic and biofilm attached cells. Significant current production required addition of menaquinone, which M. atlanticus does not produce, for electron transfer from the inner membrane to the expressed electron transfer pathway. Current through the S. oneidensis pathway in M. atlanticus was observed when inducing molecules were present during biofilm formation. Electron transfer was also reversible, indicating electron transfer into M. atlanticus could be controlled. These results show that an operationally relevant marine bacterium can be genetically engineered for environmental sensing and response using an electrical signal.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae (Spn) strains cause pneumonia that kills millions every year worldwide. Spn produces Ply, a hemolysin that lyses erythrocytes releasing hemoglobin and also produces the pro-oxidant hydrogen peroxide (Spn-H2O2) during growth. The hallmark of the pathophysiology of hemolytic diseases is the oxidation of hemoglobin but oxidative reactions catalyzed by Spn-H2O2 has been poorly studied. We characterized the oxidation of hemoglobin by Spn-H2O2. We prepared a series of single ({Delta}spxB, or {Delta}lctO), double mutant ({Delta}spxB{Delta}lctO) and complemented strains in TIGR4, D39 and EF3030. We then utilized an in vitro model with oxy-hemoglobin to demonstrate that oxy-hemoglobin was oxidized rapidly, within 30 min of incubation, by Spn-H2O2 to met-hemoglobin and that the main source of Spn-H2O2 was pyruvate oxidase (SpxB). Moreover, extended incubation caused the release and the degradation of heme. We then assessed oxidation of hemoglobin and heme degradation by other bacteria inhabitants of the respiratory tract. All hydrogen peroxide-producing streptococci tested caused the oxidation of hemoglobin and heme degradation whereas those bacterial species that produce <1 M H2O2, neither oxidized hemoglobin nor degraded heme. An ex vivo bacteremia model confirmed that oxidation of hemoglobin and heme degradation occurred concurrently with hemoglobin that was released from erythrocytes by Ply. Finally, gene expression studies demonstrated that heme, but not red blood cells or hemoglobin induced an upregulated transcription of the spxB gene. Oxidation of hemoglobin may be important for pathogenesis and for the symbiosis of hydrogen peroxide-producing bacteria with other species by providing nutrients such as iron.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the relationships between symptomatic early-time SARS-CoV-2 viral load and upper airway mucosal gene expression and immune response. To examine the association of symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 early viral load with upper airway mucosal gene expression, we profiled the host mucosal transcriptome from nasopharyngeal swab samples from 68 adults with symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19. We measured SARS-CoV-2 viral load using qRT-PCR. We then examined the association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load with upper airway mucosal immune response. We detected SARS-CoV-2 in all samples and recovered >80% of the genome from 85% of the samples from symptomatic COVID-19 adults. The respiratory virome was dominated by SARS-CoV-2, with limited co-detection of common respiratory viruses i.e., only the human Rhinovirus (HRV) being identified in 6% of the samples. We observed a significant positive correlation between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and interferon signaling (OAS2, OAS3, IFIT1, UPS18, ISG15, ISG20, IFITM1, and OASL), chemokine signaling (CXCL10 and CXCL11), and adaptive immune system (IFITM1, CD300E, and SIGLEC1) genes in symptomatic, mild-to-moderate COVID-19 adults, when adjusted for age, sex and race. Interestingly, the expression levels of most of these genes plateaued at a CT value of ~25. Overall, our data shows that early nasal mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection is viral load dependent, which potentially could modify COVID-19 outcomes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYSeveral prior studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 viral load can predict the likelihood of disease spread and severity. A higher detectable SARS-CoV-2 plasma viral load was associated with worse respiratory disease severity. However, the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viral load and airway mucosal gene expression and immune response remains elusive. We profiled the nasal mucosal transcriptome from nasal samples collected from adults infected with SARS-CoV-2 during Spring 2020 with mild-to-moderate symptoms using a comprehensive metatranscriptomics method. We observed a positive correlation between SARS-CoV-2 viral load with interferon signaling, chemokine signaling, and adaptive immune system in adults with COVID-19. Our data suggest that early nasal mucosal immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection was viral load-dependent and may modify COVID-19 outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of an RNA replicase capable of self-replication is considered an important stage in the origin of life. RNA polymerase ribozymes (PR) including a variant that uses trinucleotide triphosphates (triplets) as substrates have been created by in vitro evolution and are the closest functional analogues of the replicase but the structural basis for their function is poorly understood. Here, we leverage single-particle cryo-EM and high-throughput mutation analysis to obtain the structure of a triplet polymerase ribozyme (TPR) apoenzyme and map its functional landscape. The TPR cryo-EM structure at 5-[A] resolution reveals an RNA heterodimer comprising a catalytic and an inactive accessory subunit, where the complex resembles a left hand with thumb and fingers at a 70{degrees} angle. The two subunits are connected by two distinct kissing-loop (KL) interactions that are essential for polymerase function. Our combined structural and functional data suggest a model for templated RNA synthesis by the TPR holoenzyme whereby heterodimer formation and KL interactions preorganize the TPR for optimal template binding and templated RNA synthesis activity. These results provide a foundation for a better understanding RNAs potential for self-replication.",

    "abstract": "Ferroportin (Fpn) is the only known iron exporter in humans and is essential for maintaining iron homeostasis. Fpn activity is suppressed by hepcidin, an endogenous peptide hormone, which inhibits iron export and promotes endocytosis of Fpn. Hepcidin deficiency leads to hemochromatosis and iron-loading anemia. Previous studies have shown that small peptides that mimic the first few residues of hepcidin, i.e. minihepcidins, are more potent than hepcidin. However, the mechanism of enhanced inhibition by minihepcidins remains unclear. Here, we report the structure of human ferroportin in complex with a minihepcidin, PR73 that mimics the first 9 residues of hepcidin, at 2.7 [A] overall resolution. The structure reveals novel interactions that were not present between Fpn and hepcidin. We validate PR73-Fpn interactions through binding and transport assays. These results provide insights into how minihepcidins increase inhibition potency and will guide future developments of Fpn inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria and eukaryotic algae make a major contribution to global photosynthetic productivity. To cope with the low availability of CO2 in aqueous systems they deploy inorganic carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs). These concentrate CO2 in microcompartments that contain Rubisco (carboxysomes in cyanobacteria; pyrenoids in green algae). The rest of the Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC) is located outside these microcompartments. We hypothesized that this physical separation requires modified poising of the CBC. Hence, Rubisco is physically separated from the other CBC enzymes outside these microcompartments. To test the hypothesis that this physical separation requires appropriate poising of the CBC, we profiled CBC metabolites under ambient CO2 in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and three eukaryotic algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Chlorella sorokiniana, Chlorella ohadii). Comparison with recently reported profiles for a large set of terrestrial plants revealed that cyanobacteria and green algae have very distinctive CBC metabolite profiles, with low levels of pentose phosphates and, especially, high levels of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate. We propose that large pools of the substrate and product of Rubisco are required to generate concentration gradients that drive movement into and out of the microcompartments. These observations raise questions about how CBC regulation was modified during the evolution of algal CCMs and their subsequent loss in terrestrial plants, and highlight that operation of CCMs requires co-evolution of the CBC.\n\nHighlightCBC metabolite profiles in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis and in three eukaryotic green algae at ambient CO2 concentration are very different to those in terrestrial plants, probably reflecting the operation of a carboxysome- or pyrenoid-based carbon concentrating mechanism.",

Recently, we found that nucleic acids, and G-quadruplexes in particular, are potent chaperones for preventing protein aggregation. With the aid of structure-function and NMR analyses of two G-quadruplex forming sequences, PARP-I and LTR-III, we uncovered several contributing factors that affect G-quadruplexes in preventing protein aggregation. Notably, three factors emerged as vital in determining holdase activity of G-quadruplexes: their structural topology, structural dynamics, and oligomerization state. These factors together appear to largely dictate whether a G-quadruplex is able to prevent partially misfolded proteins from aggregating. Understanding the genesis of G-quadruplexes power as chaperones is an important facet to elucidating various protein aggregation diseases.\n\nKey Points- How nucleic acids act as protein chaperones is currently unknown.\n- G-quadruplexes are excellent at preventing protein aggregation, and here we describe basic tenets of this activity.\n- This activity could help design treatments for multiple neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCalcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the pathological remodeling of the valve leaflets which leads to heart failure and high stroke risk. While several mechanisms are known to drive cardiovascular calcification, the initial steps orchestrating the osteogenic reprogramming of cells are not fully understood. Non-canonical functions of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) include service as a cofactor to stimulate gene transcription, and TERT overexpression primes mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate into osteoblasts. We investigated whether TERT contributes to osteogenic reprogramming of valve interstitial cells.\n\nMethodsBaseline transcription of TERT and osteogenic markers, senescence, DNA damage, and telomere length in valve tissue and primary aortic valve interstitial cells (VICs) from control and CAVD patients were assessed. TERT expression was depleted in cells using lentiviral vectors. Cells from Tert+/+ and Tert-/- mice were used to validate human findings. Immunofluorescence staining, proximity ligation assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay were used in mechanistic experiments.\n\nResultsTERT protein was highly expressed in calcified valve leaflets, without changes in telomere length, DNA damage, or senescence. These phenotypic features were retained in primary VICs isolated and cultured from those diseased tissues. TERT levels were increased with osteogenic or inflammatory stimuli, and genetic deletion or reduction of TERT prevented calcification of VICs isolated from humans and mice. Similar results were seen in smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). TERT and Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 5A/B (STAT5) colocalize and bind to the Runt-Related Transcription Factor 2 (RUNX2) gene promoter, and TERT and STAT5 co-localized in calcified valve tissues. Pharmacological inhibition of STAT5A prevented calcification in vitro.\n\nConclusionsThese data show that non-canonical TERT activity is required for the calcification of VICs. TERT partners with STAT5A to bind to and activate the RUNX2 gene promoter. These data identify a novel therapeutic target to abate vascular calcification.\n\nNovelty and SignificanceO_ST_ABSWhat Is Known?C_ST_ABSO_LICalcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is the most prevalent form of aortic valve pathology. CAVD strongly correlates with age and leads to heart failure and a high risk of stroke. Currently, the only therapeutic option is valve replacement, which comes with significant healthcare costs and additional risks to patients.\nC_LIO_LIRunt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) is the master transcription factor required for osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts and osteogenic reprogramming of vascular cells, yet the early events driving its transcription in valve cells are not well defined.\nC_LIO_LIOverexpression of TERT primes mesenchymal stem cells to differentiate down the osteoblast lineage, suggesting that TERT signaling plays an important role in cell differentiation and phenotype.\nC_LI\n\nWhat New Information Does This Article Contribute?O_LITERT protein is highly expressed in calcified aortic leaflets and valve interstitial cells, independent of changes in telomere length.\nC_LIO_LIGenetic loss or depletion of TERT blocks calcification in valve interstitial cells, coronary smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal stem cells.\nC_LIO_LITERT co-localizes with STAT5 in the cytosol and on the RUNX2 gene promoter, the master regulator of osteogenic transcriptional programs.\nC_LIO_LIPharmacological inhibition of STAT5 prevents calcification of human valve interstitial cells, coronary smooth muscle cells, and mesenchymal stem cells.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the clinical implications?O_LIWe have identified TERT/STAT5 as novel signaling axis that promotes the early transcriptional reprogramming in cardiovascular cells. Inhibiting TERT and STAT5 interaction and activity can be leveraged for the development of pharmacological or biological therapeutic strategies to halt or prevent calcification in the aortic valve and perhaps other cardiovascular tissues.\nC_LIO_LISurgical procedures are currently the only treatment option for patients with CAVD.

    "abstract": "Structural chromosome rearrangements involving translocations, fusions and fissions lead to evolutionary variation between species and potentially reproductive isolation and variation in gene expression. While the wheats (Triticeae, Poaceae) and oats (Aveneae) all maintain a basic chromosome number of x=7, genomes of oats show frequent intergenomic translocations, in contrast to wheats where these translocations are relatively rare. We aimed to show genome structural diversity and genome relationships in tetraploid, hexaploid and octoploid Avena species and amphiploids, establishing patterns of intergenomic translocations across different oat taxa using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with four well-characterized repetitive DNA sequences: pAs120, AF226603, Ast-R171 and Ast-T116. In A. agadiriana (2n=4x=28), the selected probes hybridized to all chromosomes indicating that this species originated from one (autotetraploid) or closely related ancestors with the same genomes. Hexaploid amphiploids were confirmed as having the genomic composition AACCDD, while octoploid amphiploids showed three different genome compositions: AACCCCDD, AAAACCDD or AABBCCDD. The A, B, C, and D genomes of oats differ significantly in their involvement in non-centromeric, intercalary translocations. There was a predominance of distal intergenomic translocations from the C-into the D-genome chromosomes. Translocations from A- to C-, or D- to C-genome chromosomes were less frequent, proving that at least some of the translocations in oat polyploids are non-reciprocal. Rare translocations from A- to D-, D- to A- and C- to B-genome chromosomes were also visualized. The fundamental research has implications for exploiting genomic biodiversity in oat breeding to through introgression from wild species potentially with contrasting chromosomal structures and hence deleterious segmental duplications or large deletions in amphiploid parental lines.",

Hence, several biotechnologically important microorganisms have been recently engineered for fixing C1 substrates. However, reports about C1-based bioproduction with these organisms are scarce. Here, we describe the optimization of a previously engineered formatotrophic Escherichia coli strain. Short-term adaptive laboratory evolution enhanced biomass yield and accelerated growth of formatotrophic E. coli to 3.3 g-CDW/mol-formate and 6 hours doubling time, respectively. Genome sequence analysis revealed that manipulation of acetate metabolism is the reason for better growth performance, verified by subsequent reverse engineering of the parental E. coli strain. Moreover, the improved strain is capable of growing to an OD600 of 22 in bioreactor fed-batch experiments, highlighting its potential use for industrial bioprocesses. Finally, demonstrating the strains potential to support a sustainable, formate-based bioeconomy, lactate production from formate and CO2 was engineered. The optimized strain generated 1.2 mM lactate--10 % of the theoretical maximum--providing the first proof-of-concept application of the reductive glycine pathway for bioproduction.",

    "abstract": "Vaccination has significantly reduced the incidence of invasive infections caused by several bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Neisseria meningitidis. However, no vaccines are available for many other invasive pathogens. A major hurdle in vaccine development is the lack of functional markers to quantify vaccine immunity in eliminating pathogens in the process of infection. Based on our recent discovery of the liver as the major organ of vaccine-induced clearance of blood-borne virulent bacteria, we here describe a new vaccine evaluation system that quantitatively characterize important properties of effective vaccines in shuffling virulent bacteria from the blood circulation to the liver resident macrophage Kupffer cells (KCs) and sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) in animal models. This system consists of three related correlates or assays: pathogen clearance from the bloodstream, pathogen trapping in the liver, and pathogen capture by KCs/LSECs. The readouts of these correlates were consistently associated with the serotype-specific immunoprotection levels of the 13-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide conjugate vaccine (PCV13) against lethal infections of S. pneumoniae, a major invasive pathogen of community-acquired infections in humans. Furthermore, the reliability and sensitivity of these correlates in reflecting vaccine efficacy were verified with whole cell vaccines of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, two major pathogens in hospital-acquired invasive infections. This system may be used as cost effective readouts to evaluate the immunoprotective potential of vaccine candidates in the preclinical phase by filling the current technical gap in vaccine evaluation between the conventional in vitro approaches (e.g., antibody production and pathogen neutralization/opsonophagocytosis) and survival of immunized animals.",

We developed a new latency CRISPR screening strategy, called Latency HIV-CRISPR, which uses the packaging of guideRNA-encoding lentiviral vector genomes into the supernatant of budding virions as a direct readout of factors involved in the maintenance of HIV-1 latency. We developed a custom guideRNA library targeting epigenetic regulatory genes and paired the screen with and without a latency reversal agent - AZD5582, an activator of the non-canonical NF{kappa}B pathway - to examine a combination of mechanisms controlling HIV-1 latency. A component of the Nucleosome Acetyltransferase of H4 histone acetylation (NuA4 HAT) complex, ING3, acts in concert with AZD5582 to activate proviruses in J-Lat cell lines and in a primary CD4+ T cell model of HIV-1 latency. We found that the knockout of ING3 reduces acetylation of the H4 histone tail and BRD4 occupancy on the HIV-1 LTR, and only in the combination of ING3 knockout with the activation of non-canonical NF{kappa}B via AZD5582 is there dramatic increase in initiation and elongation of RNA Polymerase II on the HIV-1 provirus in a manner that is nearly unique among all cellular promoters.",

They mediate their own transfer from host cells (donors) to recipients and allow bacteria to acquire new phenotypes, including pathogenic and metabolic capabilities and drug resistances. Streptococcus mutans, a major causative agent of dental caries, contains a putative ICE, TnSmu1, integrated at the 3 end of a leucyl tRNA gene. We found that TnSmu1 is a functional ICE, containing all the genes necessary for ICE function. It excised from the chromosome and excision was stimulated by DNA damage. We identified the DNA junctions generated by excision of TnSmu1, defined the ends of the element, and detected the extrachromosomal circle. We found that TnSmu1 can transfer from S. mutans donors to recipients when co-cultured on solid medium. The presence of TnSmu1 in recipients inhibited successful acquisition of another copy and this inhibition was mediated, at least in part, by the likely transcriptional repressor encoded by the element. Using microscopy to track individual cells, we found that activation TnSmu1 caused an arrest of cell growth. Our results demonstrate that TnSmu1 is a functional ICE that affects the biology of its host cells.",

    "abstract": "The planorbid gastropod genus Bulinus consists of 38 species that vary in their ability to vector Schistosoma haematobium (the causative agent of human urogenital schistosomiasis), other Schistosoma species, and non-schistosome trematodes infecting animals. Relying on sequence-based identifications of bulinids (partial cox1 and 16S) and Schistosoma (cox1 and ITS), we examined Bulinus species in the Lake Victoria Basin in Kenya for naturally acquired infections with Schistosoma species. We collected 6,133 bulinids from 11 sites between 2014-2021, 226 (3.7%) of which harbored Schistosoma infections. We found 4 Bulinus taxa from Lake Victoria (B. truncatus, B. tropicus, B. ugandae, and B. cf. transversalis), and an additional 4 from other habitats (B. globosus, B. productus, B. forskalii, and B. scalaris). S. haematobium infections were found in B. globosus and B. productus (with infections in the former predominating) whereas S. bovis infections were identified in B. globosus, B. productus, B. forskalii, and B. ugandae. No nuclear/mitochondrial discordance potentially indicative of S. haematobium/S. bovis hybridization was detected. We highlight the presence of Bulinus ugandae as a distinct lake-dwelling taxon closely related to B. globosus yet, unlike all other members of the B. africanus species group, is likely not a vector for S. haematobium, though it does exhibit susceptibility to S. bovis. Other lake-dwelling bulinids also lacked S. haematobium infections, supporting the possibility that they all lack compatibility with local S. haematobium, thereby preventing widespread transmission of urogenital schistosomiasis in the lakes waters. We support B. productus as a distinct species from B. nasutus, B. scalaris as distinct from B. forskalii, and add further evidence for a B. globosus species complex with three lineages represented in Kenya alone. This study serves as an essential prelude for investigating why these patterns exist and whether the underlying biological mechanisms may be exploited for the purpose of limiting schistosome transmission.\n\nAuthor SummarySchistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by members of the genus Schistosoma. Every schistosome species is dependent on a particular species, or array of species, of intermediate snail host(s) for transmission. In the Lake Victoria Basin in Kenya, two related schistosome species (Schistosoma haematobium and Schistosoma bovis) utilize multiple species within the genus Bulinus as intermediate hosts. Discerning which bulinid species vector the agent of human schistosomiasis, which are vectors for bovine schistosomiasis, which are vectors for both, and identifying the habitats for each, is critical to understanding local transmission patterns. Confident snail species identification is a prerequisite for implicating a snail in transmission. Certain closely related bulinids cannot be confidently distinguished between using morphological criteria and previously published misidentifications have obscured the literature regarding where human schistosomiasis transmission occurs. This study used sequence-based methods to identify local bulinid species and to identify schistosomes from infected snails. Our results implicate two bulinid species in the transmission of S. haematobium and four species in the transmission of S. bovis. Both S. haematobium associated species were found exclusively in streams and dams in the Lake Victoria Basin thereby seemingly keeping the shores of Lake Victoria free of S. haematobium transmission.",

However, within the preclinical pipeline, in vitro screening conditions can differ significantly from the final in vivo settings. To bridge the gap between in vitro and in vivo assays, we developed a pig skin-based bioluminescent ex vivo burn wound infection model, enabling real-time assessment of antibacterials in a longitudinal, non-destructive manner. We provide a proof-of-concept for A. baumannii NCTC13423, a multidrug-resistant clinical isolate, which was equipped with the luxCDABE operon as a reporter using a Tn7-based tagging system. This bioluminescence model provided a linear correlation between the number of bacteria and a broad dynamic range (104 to 109 CFU). This longitudinal model was subsequently validated using a fast-acting enzybiotic as an antibacterial. Since this model combines a realistic, clinically relevant yet strictly controlled environment with real-time measurement of bacterial burden, we put forward this ex vivo model as a valuable tool to assess the preclinical potential of novel antibacterial compounds.\n\nSummary statementHere, we demonstrate the potential of a bioluminescence-based ex vivo model for the longitudinal assessment of antibacterials.

We analyzed if the species ecological niche and waterfalls explain the genetic distance in Brazilian Amazonia.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated the P. unifilis spatial distribution of genetic variability and diversity using the control region of mitochondrial DNA. We tested the hypotheses of isolation either by distance and resistance through an integrative approach using genetic, geographic, and ecological data. We created a resistance matrix using species niche modeling. We compared the explanation power of geographical distance (both linear and in-water distance) and resistance distance on genetic distance ({Phi}ST fixation index) using multiple regressions and Mantel tests.\n\nResultsWe found a high genetic diversity and pattern of genetic structure proved to be geographically complex. The population structure followed some watersheds but also showed structuring within different rivers. We found that landscape resistance better explains genetic distance than linear and in-water distance.\n\nConclusionsThe resistance of the landscape influences the displacement of individuals by aquatic, vegetational, biological, and geomorphological variables, and efforts to species conservation need to be applied throughout its distribution considering landscape genetics.",

    "abstract": "To improve our understanding of genetic mechanisms underlying complex traits in plants, a comprehensive analysis of gene variants is required. Eucalyptus is an important forest plantation genus that is highly outbred. Trait dissection and molecular breeding in eucalypts currently relies on biallelic SNP markers. These markers fail to capture the large amount of haplotype diversity in these species and thus multi-allelic markers are required. We aimed to develop a gene-based haplotype mining panel for Eucalyptus species. We generated 17 999 oligonucleotide probe sets for targeted sequencing of selected regions of 6 293 genes implicated in growth and wood properties, pest and disease resistance and abiotic stress responses. We identified and phased 195 834 SNPs using a read-based phasing approach to reveal SNP-based haplotypes. A total of 8 915 target regions (at 4 637 gene loci) passed tests for Mendelian inheritance. We evaluated the haplotype panel in four Eucalyptus species (E. grandis, E. urophylla, E. dunnii and E. nitens) to determine its ability to capture diversity across eucalypt species. This revealed an average of 3.13 to 4.52 haplotypes per target region in each species and 33.36% of the identified haplotypes were shared by at least two species. This haplotype mining panel will enable the analysis of haplotype diversity within and between species and provide multi-allelic markers that can be used for genome-wide association studies and gene-based breeding approaches.\n\nSignificance StatementWe developed a haplotype sequencing panel for Eucalyptus targeting 8915 regions at 4637 gene loci associated with growth and wood properties, pest and disease resistance and abiotic stress response providing a genome-wide, multi-allelic, gene centric genotyping resource for eucalypts. We tested the panel in four Eucalyptus species (E. grandis, E. dunnii, E. nitens and E. urophylla) and found an average of 3.65 haplotypes per target region per species, and 9.98 across all four species.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria of the genus Shigella are a major contributor to the global diarrhoeal disease burden causing >200,000 deaths per annum globally where S. flexneri is the major pathogenic species. Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Shigella and the lack of a licenced vaccine has led WHO to recognise Shigella as a priority organism for the development of new antimicrobials. Understanding what drives the long-term persistence and success of this pathogen is critical for ongoing shigellosis management and is relevant for other enteric bacteria.\n\nTo identify key genetic drivers of Shigella evolution over the past 100 years, we analysed S. flexneri from the historical Murray collection (n=45, isolated between 1917-1954) alongside a comparatively modern collection (n=262, isolated between 1950-2011) using a novel approach called temporal genome-wide association study (tGWAS). We identified SNPs (n=94), COGs (n=359) and significant kmers within 48 genes significantly positively associated with time. These included T3SS encoding genes, proteins involved in intracellular competition, acquired antimicrobial resistance genes, insertion sequences, and genes of unknown function (28%, 49/172 of those hits investigated).\n\nAmong the unknown proteins we identified a novel plasmid borne putative adhesin, named Stv. Genomic epidemiological analyses reveal that Stv was associated with clonal expansions of multiple phylogroups of S. flexneri and its acquisition predates multidrug resistance acquisition and the global dissemination of Lineage III S. sonnei. Stv, and close relatives, are widely distributed in other Enterobactericeae and bacteria, indicating that its importance likely extends beyond shigellae.\n\nThis work highlights the effectiveness of using tGWAS on historical isolate collections for identifying novel contributors to pathogen success over time. This approach is readily translatable to other pathogens and our application in Shigella identified Stv, a putative adhesin and potential drug target that is widely distributed across the AMR priority group Enterobacteriaceae.\n\nAuthor SummaryShigellosis is a leading cause of diarrhoeal disease worldwide and is represented among the multiple Enterobacteriaceae which WHO have declared as priority pathogens for which new antimicrobials are urgently needed. The majority of shigellosis is caused by the species Shigella flexneri and Shigella sonnei.\n\nIn this study we collated S. flexneri isolates that spanned a 94-year period, encompassing the pre- and post-antibiotic era to implement a novel bioinformatic technique, temporal GWAS (tGWAS), to identify key factors of pathogen success during this time period. Alongside recovering AMR and virulence genes, we also identified a novel, mobilisable putative adhesin, named Stv herein, which appeared to contribute to clonal expansions across multiple Shigella species and is present across the broader Enterobacteriaceae. Our results indicate the potential importance of Stv in controlling Shigella and other infections, and the validity of a tGWAS approach for identifying biological drivers underpinning the evolution and expansion of AMR pathogens over time.",

    "abstract": "Ras-like protein 1 (CaRas1) is a key regulator of the switch between the yeast and hyphal forms of Candida albicans, a feature associated with pathogenesis. CaRas1 is activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) CaCdc25, triggering hyphal growth-related signaling pathways through its highly conserved GTP-binding domain (G-domain). An important function in hyphal growth has also been proposed for the long hypervariable region downstream of the G-domain of CaRas1, whose unusual content of polyQ stretches and Q/N repeats make CaRas1 unique within Ras-family proteins. Despite its biological importance, both the structure of CaRas1 and the molecular basis of its activation by CaCdc25 remain unexplored. Here, we show that CaRas1 displays an elongated shape and that its hypervariable region contains helical structural elements with intramolecular coiled-coil propensity and limited conformational flexibility. Functional assays revealed that CaRas1 activation by CaCdc25 is highly efficient, with 5-to 2000-fold higher activity levels than reported for human GEFs. In addition, the threedimensional structure of the catalytic region of CaCdc25, together with the structural characterization of CaRas1/CaCdc25 complexes, unveiled a specific region located in the -helical hairpin of CaCdc25, critical for CaRas1 activation, where negatively charged substitutions reduce its activity. The unique structural features of the low complexity region of CaRas1 and the distinctive properties of CaRas1 activation by CaCdc25, common in the homologous proteins from CTG-clade species, uncover novel strategies to target key virulence factors in human-infecting fungal pathogens.",

Using simulated odorant-binding proteins (OBPs) and machine learning methods, we designed a multiplex of short VOC- and carbon-binding peptide probes that detect the characteristic \"VOC fingerprint\". Specifically, we target VOCs associated with COVID-19 in a compact, molecular sensor array that directly transduces vapor composition into multi-channel electrical signals. Rapidly synthesizable, chimeric VOC- and solid-binding peptides were derived from selected OBPs using multi-sequence alignment with protein database structures. Selective peptide binding to targeted VOCs and sensor surfaces was validated using surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance. VOC sensing was demonstrated by peptide-sensitized, exposed-channel carbon nanotube transistors. The data-to-device pipeline enables the development of novel devices for non-invasive monitoring, diagnostics of diseases, and environmental exposures assessment.",

While murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) has multiple strategies for manipulating the antigen processing pathway to evade immune responses, the host has also developed ways to counter viral immune evasion. In this study, we found that MCMV modulates ERAAP and induces an IFN-{gamma} producing CD8+ T cell effector response that targets uninfected ERAAP deficient cells. We also observed that ERAAP downregulation during infection led to presentation of the self-peptide FL9 on non-classical Qa-1b, thereby eliciting Qa-1b restricted QFL T cells to proliferate in the liver and spleen of infected mice. QFL T cells upregulated effector markers upon MCMV infection and were sufficient to reduce viral load after transfer to immunodeficient mice. Our study highlights the consequences of ERAAP dysfunction during viral infection and provides potential targets for antiviral therapies.",

    "abstract": "Vibrio parahaemolyticus is the leading cause of seafood-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. A distinctive feature of the O3:K6 pandemic clone, and its derivatives, is the presence of a second, phylogenetically distinct, Type III Secretion System (T3SS2) encoded within the genomic island VPaI-7. The T3SS2 allows the delivery of effector proteins directly into the cytosol of infected eukaryotic cells to subvert key host cell processes, critical for V. parahaemolyticus to colonize and cause disease. Furthermore, the T3SS2 also increases the environmental fitness of V. parahaemolyticus in its interaction with bacterivorous protists; hence it has been proposed that it contributed to the global oceanic spread of the pandemic clone. Several reports have identified T3SS2-related genes in Vibrio and non-Vibrio species, suggesting that the T3SS2 gene cluster is not restricted to the Vibrionaceae and can mobilize through horizontal gene transfer events. In this work, we performed a large-scale genomic analysis to determine the phylogenetic distribution of the T3SS2 gene cluster and its repertoire of effector proteins. We identified putative T3SS2 gene clusters in 1130 bacterial genomes from 8 bacterial genera, 5 bacterial families and 47 bacterial species. A hierarchical clustering analysis allowed us to define 6 T3SS2 subgroups (I-VI) with different repertoires of effector proteins, redefining the concepts of T3SS2 core and accessory effector proteins. Finally, we identified a subset of T3SS2 gene clusters (subgroup VI) that lack most T3SS2 effector proteins described to date and provided a list of 10 novel effector candidates for this subgroup through bioinformatic analysis. Collectively, our findings indicate that the T3SS2 extends beyond the Vibrionaceae family and suggest that different effector protein repertories could have a differential impact on the pathogenic potential and environmental fitness of each bacteria that have acquired the Vibrio T3SS2 gene cluster.\n\nDATA SUMMARYO_LIAll genome sequences used in this study were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) RefSeq or GenBank databases (See Table S1 for accession numbers).\nC_LIO_LIFiles for the T3SS2 reconstructed phylogenetic tree (Newick tree and MSA fasta file), hierarchical clustering data analysis file from MORPHEUS, Table S1 with genome accession numbers and all the data of the absence/presence of T3SS2-related components, and Table S2 with the prediction of novel effector proteins are available as part of the online Supporting Dataset at the Zenodo data repository (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7016552).

    "abstract": "The Rab27 effectors play versatile roles in regulated exocytosis. In pancreatic beta cells, exophilin-8 anchors granules in the peripheral actin cortex, whereas granuphilin and melanophilin mediate granule fusion with and without stable docking to the plasma membrane, respectively. However, it is unknown whether these coexisting effectors function in parallel or in sequence to support the whole insulin secretory process. Here, we investigate their functional relationship by comparing the exocytic phenotypes in beta cells simultaneously lacking two effectors with those lacking one of them. Analyses of prefusion profiles by total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy indicate that melanophilin exclusively functions downstream of exophilin-8 to mobilize granules for fusion from the actin network to the plasma membrane after stimulation. The two effectors are physically linked via the exocyst complex. Downregulation of the exocyst component affects granule exocytosis only in the presence of exophilin-8. Exophilin-8 also promotes fusion of granules stably docked to the plasma membrane mediated by granuphilin, although it is dispensable for granule residence beneath the plasma membrane. The current study presents the first diagram for multiple intracellular paths of granule exocytosis and for functional hierarchy among different Rab27 effectors in the same cell.",

    "abstract": "In addition to its well-known receptor-mediated function in cell survival, differentiation and growth, we report that the extracellular brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also controls the intracellular KEAP1-NRF2 cytoprotective system by a receptor-independent pathway. Extracellular BDNF can cross the cell membrane as it possesses a protein-translocation domain, also known as cell-penetrating peptide. This membrane crossing process is energy-independent, ruling out endocytosis and receptor-dependent mechanisms. Once in the cytosol, BDNF binds to KEAP1 with a nanomolar affinity, enabling nuclear translocation of NRF2 and transcription of NRF2-target genes. BDNF is thus a major regulator of NRF2 activation. A dysfunction of this BDNF-KEAP1-NRF2 pathway may be involved in most diseases where antioxidant and cytoprotective functions are altered. This novel form of communication, whereby a receptor ligand protein exerts a biological activity by crossing the cell membrane, opens new avenues for cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "1.Wnt and Hh are known signalling pathways involved in neural differentiation and recent work has shown the cell cycle regulator, Never in Mitosis Kinase 2 (Nek2) is able to regulate both pathways. Despite its known function in pathway regulation, few studies have explored Nek2 within embryonic development. The P19 embryonal carcinoma cell model was used to investigate Nek2 and neural differentiation through CRISPR knockout and overexpression studies. Loss of Nek2 reduced cell proliferation in the undifferentiated state and during directed differentiation, while overexpression increased cell proliferation. Despite these changes in proliferation rates, Nek2 deficient cells maintained pluripotency markers after neural induction while Nek2 overexpressing cells lost these markers in the undifferentiated state. Nek2 deficient cells lost the ability to differentiate into both neurons and astrocytes, although Nek2 overexpressing cells enhanced neuron differentiation at the expense of astrocytes. Hh and Wnt signaling were explored, however there was no clear connection between Nek2 and these pathways causing the observed changes to differentiation phenotypes. Mass spectrometry was also used during wildtype and Nek2 knockout cell differentiation and we identified reduced electron transport chain components in the knockout population. Immunoblotting confirmed the loss of these components and additional studies showed cells lacking Nek2 were exclusively glycolytic. Interestingly, hypoxia inducible factor 1 was stabilized in these Nek2 knockout cells despite culturing them under normoxic conditions. Since neural differentiation requires a metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, we propose a mechanism where Nek2 prevents HIF1 stabilization, thereby allowing cells to use oxidative phosphorylation to facilitate neuron and astrocyte differentiation.",
