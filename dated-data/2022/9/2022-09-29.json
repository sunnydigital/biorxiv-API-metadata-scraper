    "abstract": "Extensive research in the behavioural sciences has addressed peoples ability to learn stationary probabilities, which stay constant over time, but only recently have there been attempts to model the cognitive processes whereby people learn - and track - non-stationary probabilities. In this context, the old debate on whether learning occurs by gradual formation of associations or by occasional shifts between hypotheses representing beliefs about distal states of the world has resurfaced. Gallistel et al. (2014) pitched the two theories against each other in a non-stationary probability learning task. They concluded that various qualitative patterns in their data were incompatible with trial-by-trial associative learning and could only be explained by a hypothesis-testing model. Here, we contest that claim and demonstrate that it was premature. First, we argue that their experimental paradigm consisted of two distinct tasks: probability tracking (an estimation task) and change detection (a decision-making task). Next, we present a model that uses the (associative) delta learning rule for the probability tracking task and bounded evidence accumulation for the change-detection task. We find that this combination of two highly established theories accounts well for all qualitative phenomena and outperforms the alternative model proposed by Gallistel et al. in a quantitative model comparison. In the spirit of cumulative science, we conclude that current experimental data on human learning of non-stationary probabilities can be explained as a combination of associative learning and bounded evidence accumulation and does not require a new model.",

    "abstract": "Ciliary assembly, trafficking, and regulation are dependent on microtubules, but the mechanisms of ciliary assembly also require the actin cytoskeleton. Here, we dissect subcellular roles of actin in ciliogenesis by focusing on actin networks nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex in the powerful ciliary model, Chlamydomonas. We find the Arp2/3 complex is required for the initial stages of ciliary assembly when protein and membrane are in high demand but cannot yet be supplied from the Golgi complex. We provide evidence for Arp2/3 complex-dependent endocytosis of ciliary proteins, an increase in endocytic activity upon induction of ciliary growth, and relocalization of plasma membrane proteins to newly formed cilia. Our data support a new model of ciliary protein and membrane trafficking during early ciliogenesis whereby proteins previously targeted to the plasma membrane are reclaimed by Arp2/3 complex-dependent endocytosis for initial ciliary assembly.\n\nSUMMARYUsing the ciliary model system Chlamydomonas, we find Arp2/3 complex-mediated endocytosis is needed to reclaim cell body plasma membrane for early ciliary assembly.",

    "abstract": "Long-term genetic studies of wild populations are very scarce, but are essential for connecting ecological and population genetics models, and for understanding the dynamics of biodiversity. We present a study of a wild wheat population sampled over a 36-year period at high spatial resolution. We genotyped 832 individuals from regular sampling along transects during the course of the experiment. Genotypes were clustered into ecological microhabitats over scales of tens of metres, and this clustering was remarkably stable over the 36 generations of the study. Simulations show that it is difficult to explain this spatial and temporal stability using only limited dispersal, suggesting a role for fine-scale local adaptation to ecological parameters. Using a common-garden experiment, we showed that the genotypes found in distinct microhabitats differ phenotypically, further supporting the hypothesis of local adaptation. Our results provide a rare insight into the population genetics of a natural population over a long monitoring period.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of mRNA degradation is critical for a diverse array of cellular processes and developmental cell fate decisions. Many methods for determining mRNA half-lives rely on transcriptional inhibition or metabolic labelling. Here we use a non-invasive method for estimating half-lives for hundreds of mRNAs in the early Drosophila embryo. This approach uses the intronic and exonic reads from a total RNA-seq time series and Gaussian process regression to model the dynamics of premature and mature mRNAs. We show how regulation of mRNA stability is used to establish a range of mature mRNA dynamics during embryogenesis, despite shared transcription profiles. Using single molecule imaging we provide evidence that, for the mRNAs tested, there is a correlation between short half-life and mRNA association with P-bodies. Moreover, we detect an enrichment of mRNA 3 ends in P-bodies in the early embryo, consistent with 5 to 3 degradation occurring in P-bodies for at least a subset of mRNAs. We discuss our findings in relation to recently published data suggesting that the primary function of P-bodies in other biological contexts is mRNA storage.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria reorganize their physiology upon entry to stationary phase. What part of this reorganization improves starvation survival is a difficult question, because the change in physiology includes a global reorganization of the proteome, envelope and metabolism of the cell. In this work, we used several trade-offs between fast growth and long survival to statistically score over 2000 E. coli proteins for their global correlation with death rate. The combined ranking allowed us to narrow down the set of proteins that positively correlate with survival and validate the causal role of a subset of proteins. Remarkably, we found that important survival genes are related to the cell envelope, i.e., periplasm and outer membrane, because maintenance of envelope integrity of E. coli plays a crucial role during starvation. Our results uncover a new protective feature of the outer membrane that adds to the growing evidence that the outer membrane is not only a barrier that prevents abiotic substances from reaching the cytoplasm, but essential for bacterial proliferation and survival.\n\nStandfirst textA trade-off between the two major modes of bacterial lifestyle, growth and starvation can be explained by bacteria investing resources into the cell envelope to make it impermeable to ions, which improves their lifespan but comes at the expense of slowing down growth.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/492425v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7534d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e02e43org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fd4acdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@39e716_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA trade-off between growth rate and death rate confines fitness of bacteria across environments.\nC_LIO_LIAnalysis of proteome signatures in 126 conditions across five independent perturbations reveals the cell envelope as a key determinant of death rate.\nC_LIO_LIThe trade-off can be abolished by changing environment to a low-salt, but osmo-balanced medium where cell envelope integrity is not limiting.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The kidney develops through elaboration of ureteric bud tubules (the future urinary collecting ducts), stroma, and nephron progenitors in the cap mesenchyme that surround each tubule tip as they branch. Dynamic interactions between these tissues coordinate a balance between ureteric bud (UB) tip branching and nephron formation that sets nephron numbers for life, which impacts the likelihood of adult disease. How then is this balance achieved? Here we study the geometric and mechanical consequences of tubule tip crowding at the embryonic kidney surface and its effect on nephron formation. We find that kidney surface curvature reduces and tubule  tip domains pack more closely over developmental time. These together create a semi-crystalline geometry of tips at the kidney surface and a rigidity transition to more solid-like tissue properties at later developmental stages. New tips overcome mechanical resistance as they branch, expand, and displace close-packed neighbors, after which residual mechanical stress dissipates. This correlates with a changing nephrogenesis rate over the tip  life-cycle. To draw a causal link between the two, we mimic a mechanical transient in human iPSC-derived nephron progenitor organoids and find increased cell commitment to early nephron aggregates. The data suggest that temporal waves of mechanical stress within nephron progenitor populations could constitute a pace-maker that synchronizes nephron formation and UB tubule duplication after E15. Ongoing efforts to understand the spatial and temporal regulation of nephron induction will clarify variation in nephron endowment between kidneys and advance engineered kidney tissues for regenerative medicine.",

Because the anatomy of the non-human primate (NHP) visual system closely resembles that of humans, it is the most likely to predict human responses to diseases and therapies. Here we replicated the SOHU glaucoma model in rhesus macaque monkeys. All six animals that we tested showed significant retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death, optic nerve (ON) degeneration, and visual functional deficits at both 3 and 6 months. In contrast to the mouse SOHU model, IOP changed dynamically in these animals, probably due to individual differences in ciliary body tolerance capability. This acute NHP glaucoma model closely recapitulates the major features of glaucomatous neurodegeneration in humans, and is therefore suitable for studying the pathology of primate RGC/ON, assessing experimental therapies for neuroprotection and regeneration, and therefore for translating relevant findings into novel and effective treatments for patients with glaucoma and other neurodegenerations.",

A unique cell-to-cell communication mechanism that uses reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a signal (termed the  ROS wave) was recently identified in flowering plants. Here we report that a ROS-mediated cell-to-cell signaling process, like the ROS wave, can be found in ferns, mosses, unicellular algae, amoeba, mammalian cells, and isolated hearts. We further show that this process can be triggered by a localized stress treatment or H2O2 application and blocked by inhibition of NADPH oxidases, and that in unicellular algae, it communicates important stress-response signals between cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that cell-to-cell ROS signaling evolved before unicellular and multicellular organisms diverged. The finding of a ROS wave-like signaling process in mammalian cells further contributes to our understanding of different diseases and could impact the development of new drugs that target cancer or heart disease.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Numerous studies indicate altered peak latency of event-related potential and altered time variability of brain function network in Parkinsons disease (PD), and the intrinsic neural timescale estimated how long neural information stored in a local brain area has been specialized. However, it was unclear whether PD patients exhibited abnormal intrinsic timescales and accompanied with abnormal grey matter and whether PD patients exhibited different temporal feature at different stages. STUDY TYPE: Prospective. POPULATION: 74 PD patients, including 44 patients in the early stage (PD-ES) and 30 patients in the late stage (PD-LS), and 73 healthy controls (HC). SEQUENCE: 3.0T MRI scanner; prototypic T1 magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE); resting-state fMRI. ASSESSMENT: the intrinsic timescales were estimated by using the magnitude of the autocorrelation of intrinsic neural signals. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) was performed to calculate the grey matter volume (GMV) in the whole brain. STATISTICAL TEST: Analysis of variance (ANOVA); two-sample t-tests; Spearman rank correlation analysis; Mann-Whitney U test; Kruskal-Wallis H test. RESULTS: We identified that the PD group had abnormal intrinsic timescales in bilateral lingual and calcarine gyri, bilateral postcentral and precentral gyri, and the right middle cingulum gyrus, which correlated with the symptom severity and the GMV. Moreover, longer timescale in the right middle frontal gyrus were also found in the PD group. Increasingly, the PD-ES group had longer timescales in the anterior cortical regions, whereas the PD-LS group had shorter timescales in the posterior cortical regions. DATA CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that PD patients exhibit abnormal intrinsic timescales in visual, sensorimotor, and cognitive systems and distinct patterns of intrinsic timescales and GMV in cerebral cortex at different stages, which might provide new insights for the neural substrate of PD.",

    "abstract": "Spliceosomal introns are gene segments removed (\"spliced\") from RNA transcripts by large ribonucleoprotein machineries called spliceosomes. In some eukaryotes a second spliceosome (the minor/ U12-type) is responsible for processing a tiny minority of introns. Despite its seemingly modest role, minor splicing has persisted for roughly 1.5 billion years of eukaryotic evolution. Identifying and cataloging minor introns in > 3000 eukaryotic genomes, we report diverse evolutionary histories including surprisingly high numbers of minor introns in some fungi and green algae, repeated massive loss, as well as several general biases in the positional and genic distributions of minor introns. We estimate that ancestral minor intron densities were comparable to those of the most minor intron-rich species, suggesting a trend of long-term stasis. Finally, three findings suggest a major role for neutral processes in minor intron evolution. First, we find highly similar patterns of minor and major intron evolution, in contrast to the predictions of both functionalist and deleterious models. Second, we find that observed functional biases among minor intron-containing genes are largely explained by these genes greater ages. Third, we find no association of intron splicing with cell proliferation in a minor intronrich fungus, suggesting that regulatory roles are lineage-specific and thus cannot offer a general explanation for minor splicings persistence. These data constitute the most comprehensive view to date of modern minor introns, their evolutionary history, and the forces shaping minor splicing, and provide a foundation for future studies of these remarkable genomic elements.",

    "abstract": "In molecular dynamics simulations we can often increase the time step by imposing constraints on internal degrees of freedom, such as bond lengths and bond angles. This allows us to extend the length of the time interval and therefore the range of physical phenomena that we can afford to simulate. In this article we analyse the impact of the accuracy of the constraint solver. We present ILVES-PC, an algorithm for imposing constraints on proteins accurately and efficiently.\n\nILVES-PC solves the same system of differential algebraic equations as the celebrated SHAKE algorithm, but uses Newtons method for solving the nonlinear constraint equations. It solves the necessary linear systems of equations using a specialised linear solver that utilises the molecular structure. ILVES-PC can rapidly solve the nonlinear constraint equations to nearly the limit of machine precision. This eliminates the spurious forces introduced to simulations through the very common use of inaccurate approximations. The run-time of ILVES-PC is proportional to the number of constraints.\n\nWe have integrated ILVES-PC into GROMACS and simulated proteins of different sizes. Compared with SHAKE, we have achieved speedups of up to 4.9x in single-threaded executions and up to 76x in shared-memory multi-threaded executions. Moreover, we find that ILVES-PC is more accurate than the P-LINCS algorithm. Our work is a proof-of-concept of the utility of software designed specifically for the simulation of polymers.\n\nAuthor summaryMolecular dynamics simulates the time evolution of molecular systems. It has become a tool of extraordinary importance for e.g. understanding biological processes and designing drugs and catalysts. This article presents an algorithm for computing the forces needed to impose constraints in molecular dynamics, i.e., the constraint forces; moreover, it analyses the effect of the accuracy of the constraint solver. Presently, it is customary to calculate the constraint forces with a relative error that that is not tiny. This is due to the high computational cost associated with the available software. Accurate calculations are possible, but they are very time-consuming. The algorithm that we present solves this problem: it computes the constraint forces accurately and efficiently. Our work will improve the accuracy and reliability of molecular dynamics simulations beyond the present state-of-the-art. The results that we present are also a proof-of-concept that special-purpose code can increase the performance of software for the simulation of polymers. The algorithm is implemented into a popular molecular simulation package, and is now available for the research community.",

    "abstract": "Unlike animals, plants have the capacity to produce new organs post-embryonically throughout their entire life cycle. This is due to stem cells present in the shoot and the root apical meristems (SAM and RAM, respectively). In the SAM, stem cells are located in the central zone (CZ) where they divide slowly. Stem cell daughters are displaced laterally and enter the peripheral zone (PZ). Here, their mitotic activity increases, and lateral organ primordia (LOP) are formed. How the spatial arrangement of these different domains is initiated and controlled during SAM growth and development, and how sites of LOP are determined in the PZ is not yet completely understood.\n\nIn the RAM, the GRAS family transcription factor SHORTROOT (SHR) acts as a master regulator of signalling pathways that maintain the root stem cell niche and control formation of ground tissue layers. We hypothesized that SHR could perform a similar role in the SAM, and found that SHR, together with its target transcription factors SCARECROW (SCR), SCARECROW-LIKE23 (SCL23) and JACKDAW (JKD), controls shoot meristem size by regulating cell division rates, and promotes formation of lateral organs. SHR, SCR, SCL23 and JKD are expressed in very distinct patterns in the SAM. Where these expression domains overlap, they can physically interact to activate expression of the key cell cycle regulator CYCLIND6;1 (CYCD6;1) and thereby promote the formation of new cell layers.\n\nIn the PZ, upregulation of SHR expression at sites of organ initiation depends on the phytohormone auxin, acting through the auxin response factor MONOPTEROS (MP) and auxin response elements in the SHR promoter. In the CZ, the SHR-target SCL23 physically interacts with WUS, a key regulator of stem cell maintenance, and both SCL23 and WUS expression are subject to negative feedback regulation from stem cells through the CLAVATA signalling pathway. Together, our findings illustrate how SHR-dependent transcription factor complexes act in different domains of the shoot meristem to mediate cell division and auxin dependent organ initiation in the PZ, and coordinate this activity with stem cell maintenance in the CZ of the SAM.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria of the genus Flavobacterium are recovered from a large variety of environments. Among the described species, Flavobacterium psychrophilum and Flavobacterium columnare are causing considerable losses in fish farms. Alongside these well-known fish-pathogenic species, isolates belonging to the same genus recovered from diseased or apparently healthy wild, feral, and farmed fish have been suspected to be pathogenic. Here, we report the identification and genomic characterization of a F. collinsii isolate (TRV642) retrieved from rainbow trout spleen. A phylogenetic tree of the genus built by aligning the core genome of 195 Flavobacterium species revealed that F. collinsii is standing within a cluster of species associated to diseased fish, the closest one being F. tructae which was recently confirmed as pathogenic. We evaluated the pathogenicity of F. collinsii TRV642 as well as of F. bernardetii F-372T, another recently described species reported as a possible emerging pathogen. Following intramuscular injection challenges in rainbow trout, no clinical signs nor mortalities were observed. However, F. collinsii was isolated from the internal organs of wounded fish, suggesting that the bacterium could invade fish under compromised conditions such as stress and/or wounds. Our results suggest that some fish-associated Flavobacterium species should be considered as opportunistic fish pathogens causing disease under specific circumstances.\n\nIMPORTANCEAquaculture has expanded significantly worldwide in the last decades and accounts for half of human fish consumption. However, infectious fish diseases are a major bottleneck for its sustainable development and an increasing number of bacterial species from diseased fish raise a great concern. The current study revealed phylogenetic associations with ecological niches among the Flavobacterium species. We also focused on Flavobacterium collinsii that belongs to a group of putative pathogenic species. The genome contents revealed a versatile metabolic repertoire suggesting the use of diverse nutrient sources, a characteristic of saprophytic or commensal bacteria. In a rainbow trout experimental challenge, the bacterium colonized only oppressed fish facing stressful conditions suggesting opportunistic pathogenic behavior. This study highlights the importance of experimentally evaluating the pathogenicity of the numerous bacterial species retrieved from diseased fish.",

Here, we have examined the evolvability of the classic bicoid network in Drosophila, which is essential for anterior-posterior patterning in the early embryo. This network can be synthetically perturbed by increasing the dosage of bicoid, which causes a posterior shift of the networks regulatory outputs and a decrease in fitness. To directly monitor network evolution across populations with extra copies of bicoid, we performed genome-wide EMS mutagenesis, followed by experimental evolution. After only 8-15 generations, evolved populations have normalized patterns of gene expression and increased survival. Using a phenomics approach, we find that populations normalized through rapid increases in embryo size driven by maternal changes in metabolism and ovariole development. We extend our results to wild populations of flies, demonstrating strong predictability. Together, our results necessitate a broader view of regulatory network evolution at the systems level. This study highlights the power of synthetic evolution using animal systems, a generalizable platform for the dissection of gene regulation and complex genomes.\n\nO_QD\"The world was to me a secret which I desired to devine.\"\n\n- Mary Shelley, Frankenstein\n\nC_QD",

    "abstract": "Multiple factors are required to form functional lymphatic vessels. Here, we uncover an essential role for the secreted protein Svep1 and the transmembrane receptor Tie1 during the development of subpopulations of the zebrafish facial lymphatic network. This specific aspect of the facial network forms independently of Vegfc signalling, which otherwise is the most prominent signalling axis in all other lymphatic beds. Additionally, we find that multiple specific and newly uncovered phenotypic hallmarks of svep1 mutants are also present in tie1, but not in tie2 or vegfc mutants. These phenotypes are observed in the lymphatic vasculature of both head and trunk, as well as in the development of the dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessel (DLAV) under reduced flow conditions. Furthermore, we show genetic interaction between svep1 and tie1 during the migration of parachordal lymphangioblasts (PLs). Therefore, our study demonstrates an important function for Tie1 signalling during lymphangiogenesis as well as blood vessel development in zebrafish and provides the first in vivo evidence for zebrafish Svep1 and Tie1 interaction. Since compound heterozygous mutations for SVEP1 and TIE2 have recently been reported in human glaucoma patients, our data have clinical relevance in demonstrating a role for Svep1 in Tie signalling in an in vivo setting.",

    "abstract": "Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a poor prognosis liver cancer characterized by high aggressiveness and resistance to therapy. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and signals imposed by oncogenic pathways, such as transforming growth factor {beta} (TGF{beta}), contribute to cholangiocarcinogenesis. Here, we identified LINC00313 lncRNA as a novel target of TGF{beta} signalling in CCA cells. TGF{beta} induced LINC00313 expression in a T{beta}RI/Smad-dependent manner. Gene expression and genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiling revealed that nuclear LINC00313 transcriptionally regulated genes involved in Wnt signalling, such as TCF7. LINC00313 gain-of-function enhanced TCF/LEF-dependent transcription, promoted colony formation in vitro and accelerated tumour growth in vivo. Genes associated with LINC00313 over-expression in human CCA were characterized by KRAS and TP53 mutations and reduced patients overall survival. Mechanistically, actin-like 6A (ACTL6A), a subunit of SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex, interacted with LINC00313 and impacted on TCF7 and SULF2 transcription. We propose a model whereby TGF{beta} induces LINC00313 in order to regulate expression of hallmark Wnt pathway genes, in co-operation with SWI/SNF. By modulating key genes of the Wnt pathway, LINC00313 fine-tunes Wnt/TCF/LEF-dependent transcriptional responses and boosts cholangiocarcinogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Given the genetic and genomic differences between Atlantic salmon of European origin and North American (N.A.) origin, it is crucial to develop unique genomic resources for each lineage. Here we describe the resources that we recently developed for genomic and genetic research in N.A. Atlantic salmon. Firstly, a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database for N.A. Atlantic salmon consisting of 3.1 million putative SNPs was generated using data from whole genome resequencing of 80 N.A. Atlantic salmon individuals; Secondly, a high density 50K SNP array enriched for the genic regions of the genome and containing three sex determination and 61 continent of origin markers was developed and validated; Thirdly, a genetic map composed of 27 linkage groups with 36K SNP markers, was generated from 2,512 individuals in 141 full-sib families; Finally, a chromosome level de-novo assembly of a male N.A. Atlantic salmon genome was generated using PacBio long-reads. Information from Hi-C proximity ligation sequences and Bionano optical mapping was used to concatenate the contigs into scaffolds. The assembly contains 1,755 scaffolds and only 1,253 gaps, with a total length of 2.83 Gb and N50 of 17.2 Mb. A BUSCO analysis detected 96.2% of conserved Actinopterygii genes in the assembly and the genetic linkage information was used to guide the formation of 27 chromosome sequences. In contrast, the karyotype of the European Atlantic salmon lineage is composed of 29 chromosomes. Comparative analysis with the reference genome assembly of the European Atlantic salmon confirmed that the karyotype differences between the two linages are caused by a fission in chromosome Ssa01 and three chromosome fusions including the p arm of chromosome Ssa01 with Ssa23, Ssa08 with Ssa29 and Ssa26 with Ssa28. The genomic resources we have generated for Atlantic salmon provide a crucial boost for genetic research and for management of farmed and wild populations in this highly valued species.",

    "abstract": "Aristaless is a major regulator of developmental processes. It is well known for its role during appendage specification and extension across animals. Butterflies and moths have two copies of aristaless, aristaless1 (al1) and aristaless2 (al2), as a result of a gene duplication event. Previous work in Heliconius has shown that both copies appear to have novel functions related to wing color patterning. Here we expand our knowledge on the expression profiles associated with both ancestral and novel functions of Al1 across embryogenesis and wing pigmentation. Furthermore, we characterize Al2 expression, providing a comparative framework for understanding the role of gene duplicates in novel and ancestral roles. Our work shows that both Al1 and Al2 expression are associated with developing sensory appendages (leg, mouth, spines, and eyes) in embryos. Interestingly, Al1 appears to show higher expression earlier in embryogenesis while the highest levels of Al2 expression are shifted to later stages of embryonic development. Furthermore, Al1 localization appears extranuclear while Al2 co-localizes tightly with nuclei earlier, and then also expands outside the nucleus later in development. We observed similar cellular expression patterns for Al1 and Al2 in pupal wings when examining their roles in pigmentation. We also describe, for the first time, how Al1 localization appear to correlates with zones of Anterior/Posterior elongation of the body during embryonic growth, showcasing a possible new function related to Aristaless previously described role in appendage extension. Overall, these data suggest similar developmental roles associated with the extension/formation of specific appendages for both duplicates. However, we describe that such functions might be regulated by spatially and temporally complex patterns of expression for al1 and al2. This work expands our knowledge of Aristaless function and expression following gene duplication and the implications of the duplication on butterfly development. Finally, and more fundamentally, our study helps clarify principles behind sub-functionalization and gene expression evolution associated with developmental functions following gene duplication events.",

    "abstract": "Understanding molecular mechanisms of cellular pathways requires knowledge of the identities of participating proteins, their cellular localization and their 3D structures. Contemporary workflows typically require multiple techniques to identify target proteins, track their localization using fluorescence microscopy, followed by in vitro structure determination. To identify mammal-specific sperm proteins and understand their functions, we developed a visual proteomics workflow to directly address these challenges. Our in situ cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging provided 6.0 [A] resolution reconstructions of axonemal microtubules and their associated proteins. The well-resolved secondary and tertiary structures allowed us to computationally match, in an unbiased manner, novel densities in our 3D reconstruction maps with 21,615 AlphaFold2-predicted protein models of the mouse proteome. We identified Tektin 5, CCDC105 and SPACA9 as novel microtubule inner proteins that form an extensive network crosslinking the lumen of microtubule and existing proteins. Additional biochemical and mass spectrometry analyses helped validate potential candidates. The novel axonemal sperm structures identified by this approach form an extensive interaction network within the lumen of microtubules, suggesting they have a role in the mechanical and elastic properties of the microtubule filaments required for the vigorous beating motions of flagella.",

    "abstract": "How the self-assembly of partially disordered proteins generates functional compartments in the cytoplasm and particularly in the nucleus is poorly understood. Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is an abundant nucleolar protein that forms large oligomers which provide the scaffold for ribosome assembly but also prevent protein aggregation as part of the cellular stress response. Examining the relationship between the self-assembly and chaperone activity of NPM1, we find that oligomerization of full-length NPM1 modulates its ability to retard amyloid formation in vitro. Machine learning and cryo-electron microscopy reveal fuzzy interactions between the disordered region and the C-terminal nucleotide-binding domain that cross-link NPM1 pentamers into oligomers. Ribosomal peptides mediate in a tighter association within the oligomers, reducing their capacity to prevent amyloid formation. We conclude that NPM1 uses a \"grappling hook\" interaction to form a network-like structure whose chaperone activity is tuned by basic proteins, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for the nucleolar stress response.",

    "abstract": "The USP22 deubiquitinase, a component of the SAGA histone modifying complex, is overexpressed in multiple human cancers, but how USP22 impacts tumorigenesis is not clear. We reported previously that Usp22 loss in mice impacts execution of several signaling pathways driven by growth factor receptors such as ERBB2. To determine whether changes in USP22 expression affects ERBB2-driven tumorigenesis, we introduced conditional overexpression or deletion alleles of Usp22 into mice bearing the MMTV-NIC transgene, which drives both rat ERBB2/NEU expression and Cre recombinase activity from the MMTV promoter resulting in mammary tumor formation. We found that USP22 overexpression in mammary glands did not further enhance primary tumorigenesis in MMTV-NIC female mice, but increased lung metastases were observed. However, deletion of Usp22 significantly decreased tumor burden and increased survival of MMTV-NIC mice. These effects were associated with markedly decreased levels of both Erbb2 mRNA and protein, indicating Usp22 loss impacts MMTV promoter activity. Usp22 loss had no impact on ERBB2 expression in other settings, including MCF10A cells bearing a CMV-driven ERBB2 transgene or in HER2+ human SKBR3 and HCC1953 cells. Decreased activity of the MMTV promoter in MMTV-NIC mice correlated with decreased expression of known regulatory factors, including the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the progesterone receptor (PR), and the chromatin remodeling factor BRG1. Together our findings indicate that increased expression of USP22 does not augment the activity of an activated ERBB2/NEU transgene, but impacts of Usp22 loss on tumorigenesis cannot be assessed in this model due to unexpected effects on MMTV-driven Erbb2/Neu expression.\n\nSignificanceOverexpression of USP22 alone is not sufficient to promote MMTV-ERBB2-driven tumor formation but may enhance metastasis. Usp22 loss impacts expression of GR, PR and BRG1, decreasing MMTV promoter activity.",

However, obtaining pure EV preparations from biofluids is challenging due to contaminants with similar physicochemical properties. Here, we performed a meta-analysis of plasma EV proteomics data deposited in public repositories to refine the protein composition of EVs and investigate potential roles in type 1 diabetes development. With the concept that each purification method yields different proportions of distinct contaminants, we grouped proteins into clusters based on their abundance profiles. This allowed us to separate clusters with classical EV markers, such as CD9, CD40, C63 and CD81, from clusters of well-known contaminants, such as serum albumin, apolipoproteins and components of the complement and coagulation pathways. Two clusters containing a total of 1720 proteins combined were enriched with EV markers and depleted in common contaminants; therefore, they were considered to contain bona fide EV components. As possible origins of plasma EVs, these clusters had markers of tissues such as spleen, liver, brain, lungs, pancreas, and blood/immune cells. These clusters were also enriched in cell surface markers CD antigens, and proteins from cell-to-cell communication and signaling pathways, such as chemokine signaling and antigen presentation. We also show that the EV component and type 1 diabetes biomarker, platelet basic protein (PPBP/CXCL7) regulates apoptosis in both beta and macrophage cell lines. Overall, our meta-analysis refined the composition of plasma EVs, reinforcing a primary function as messengers for cell-to-cell communication and signaling.

Our analysis highlights the interplay between the membrane shape and the protein density, where the shape instability concurs with a redistribution of proteins into a banded pattern.",

    "abstract": "The cardinal interneuron classes are a useful simplification of cortical interneuron diversity, but such broad subgroupings glosses over the molecular, morphological, and circuit specificity of interneuron subtypes, most notably among the somatostatin interneuron class. The organizing principles by which the connectivity of these subtypes is specified are unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we designed a series of genetic strategies to target the breadth of somatostatin interneuron subtypes. Using these strategies to target three subtypes that span the entire cortical column, we examined their afferent and efferent connectivity. Our data demonstrated that each of these possesses remarkable reciprocal connectivity with the intracortical or corticofugal pyramidal classes, as well as parvalbumin interneurons. Even when two interneuron subtypes shared the same efferent target, their synaptic targeting proved selective for particular dendritic compartments. We thus provide evidence that subtypes of somatostatin cortical interneurons form cell-type specific cortical circuits.",

    "abstract": "Advances in neural networks have been catalyzed by joint training on images and natural language, increased dataset sizes, and data diversity. We explored whether the same factors support similar improvements in predicting visual responses in the human brain. We used models pre-trained with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) - which learns image embeddings that best match text embeddings of image captions from diverse, large-scale datasets - to study visual representations. We built voxelwise encoding models based on CLIP image features to predict brain responses to real-world images. ResNet50 with CLIP explained up to R2 = 79% of variance in individual voxel responses in held-out test data, a significant increase from models trained only with image/label pairs (ImageNet trained ResNet) or text (BERT). Comparisons across different model backbones ruled out network architecture as a factor in performance improvements. Comparisons across models that controlled for dataset size and data diversity demonstrated that language feedback along with data diversity in larger datasets are important factors in explaining neural responses in high-level visual brain regions. Visualizations of model embeddings and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) revealed that our models capture both global and fine-grained semantic dimensions represented within human visual cortex.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of hair and skin disease have identified many genetic variants associated with disease phenotypes, but identifying causal variants and interpreting their function requires deciphering gene-regulatory networks in disease-relevant cell types. To this end, we generated matched scRNA- and scATAC-seq profiles of human scalp biopsies, identifying diverse cell types of the hair follicle niche. By interrogating the integrated datasets across multiple levels of cellular resolution, we infer 50-100% more enhancer-gene links than prior approaches, and show that the aggregate accessibility at linked enhancers for highly-regulated genes predicts expression. We use these gene-regulatory maps to prioritize cell types, genes, and causal variants implicated in the pathobiology of androgenetic alopecia (AGA), eczema, and other complex traits. AGA GWAS signals are strongly and specifically enriched in dermal papilla cell open chromatin regions, supporting the role of these cells as key drivers of AGA pathogenesis. Finally, we trained machine-learning models to nominate SNPs that affect gene expression through disruption of specific transcription factor binding motifs, identifying candidate functional SNPs linked to expression of WNT10A in AGA and IL18RAP in eczema. Together, this work reveals principles of gene regulation and identifies gene regulatory consequences of natural genetic variation in complex skin and hair diseases.",

However, neurons grown on flat surfaces exhibit a strongly coherent bursting behavior with limited functionality. To approach the functional richness of naturally formed neuronal circuits, here we studied neuronal networks grown on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) topographical patterns shaped as either parallel tracks or square valleys. We followed the evolution of spontaneous activity in these cultures along 20 days in vitro using fluorescence calcium imaging. The networks were characterized by rich spatiotemporal activity patterns that comprised from small regions of the culture to its whole extent. Effective connectivity analysis revealed the emergence of spatially compact functional modules that were associated to both the underpinned topographical features and predominant spatiotemporal activity fronts. Our results show the capacity of spatial constraints to mold activity and functional organization, bringing new opportunities to comprehend the structure-function relationship in living neuronal circuits.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused more than 600 million cases and over 6 million deaths worldwide. Vaccination has been the main strategy used to contain the spread of the virus, and to avoid hospitalizations and deaths. Currently, there are two mRNA-based and one adenovirus vectored vaccines approved and available for use in the U.S. population. The versatility, low cost and rapid-to-manufacture attributes of DNA vaccines are important advantages over other platforms. However, DNA vaccination must meet higher efficiency levels for use in humans. Importantly, in vivo DNA delivery combined with electroporation (EP) has been successfully used in the veterinary field. Here we evaluated the safety, immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a novel linear SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine candidate for delivered by intramuscular injection followed by electroporation (Vet-ePorator) in ferrets. The results demonstrated that the linear SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccine candidate did not cause unexpected side effects, and was able to elicit neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses using a low dose of the linear DNA construct in prime-boost regimen, and significantly reduced shedding of infectious SARS-CoV-2 through oral and nasal secretions in a ferret model.",

    "abstract": "There has been growing attention on the effect of COVID-19 on white-matter microstructure, especially among those that self-isolated after being infected. There is also immense scientific interest and potential clinical utility to evaluate the sensitivity of single-shell diffusion MRI methods for detecting such effects. In this work, the sensitivities of three single-shell-compatible diffusion MRI modeling methods are compared for detecting the effect of COVID-19, including diffusion-tensor imaging, diffusion-tensor decomposition of orthogonal moments and correlated diffusion imaging. Imaging was performed on self-isolated patients at baseline and 3-month follow-up, along with age- and sex-matched controls. We demonstrate through simulations and experimental data that correlated diffusion imaging is associated with far greater sensitivity, being the only one of the three single-shell methods to demonstrate COVID-19-related brain effects. Results suggest less restricted diffusion in the frontal lobe in COVID-19 patients, but also more restricted diffusion in the cerebellar white matter, in agreement with several existing studies highlighting the vulnerability of the cerebellum to COVID-19 infection. These results, taken together with the simulation results, suggest that a significant proportion of COVID-19 related white-matter microstructural pathology manifests as a change in water diffusivity. Interestingly, different b-values also confer different sensitivities to the effects. No significant difference was observed in patients at the 3-month follow-up, likely due to the limited size of the follow-up cohort. To summarize, correlated diffusion imaging is shown to be a sensitive single-shell diffusion analysis approach that allows us to uncover opposing patterns of diffusion changes in the frontal and cerebellar regions of COVID-19 patients, suggesting the two regions react differently to viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Sensory systems display capability to preferentially choose stimuli based on their reliability at conveying accurate information. While previous reports have shown the ability of the brain to reweigh cues based on ongoing or dynamic changes in reliability, how the brain may learn and maintain neural responses to sensory statistics expected to be stable over longer time periods remain significant open questions of potential mechanisms underlying naturalistic biased perception. This study provides evidence that the barn owls midbrain is shaped by permanent statistics experienced during development. The barn owls midbrain features a topographic map of auditory space where neurons compute horizontal sound location from the interaural time difference (ITD). Previous work has shown that frequency tuning of these midbrain map neurons is correlated with the pattern of most reliable frequencies for the neurons preferred ITD. This pattern of ITD reliability is due to the filtering properties of the head, primarily determined by the facial ruff in the barn owl. In this study, we found that the absence of a facial ruff led to a decrease in the reliability of high frequencies originating from frontal space. To test if the owls frequency tuning of midbrain map neurons is driven by permanent changes in the pattern of ITD reliability, these neurons were recorded from adult owls, who had the facial ruff removed as juveniles, and from juvenile owls, before the facial ruff developed. In both groups, we found that frontally-tuned neurons displayed tunings to frequencies lower than reported in normal adult owls, consistent with the difference in ITD reliability between the normal and ruff removed conditions. Juvenile owls also exhibited more heterogeneous frequency tuning, suggesting developmental processes that refine tuning to match the pattern of ITD reliability. Additional recordings immediately upstream of the midbrain map displayed ITD tuned neural responses for all frequencies across the owls normal hearing range. Broader analysis of the effects of ruff-removal on the acoustical properties of spatial cues indicated a dominant role of ITD reliability in driving the adaptive changes in frequency tuning. These results support the hypothesis that frequency tuning in the midbrain map is developmentally adapted to permanent statistics of spatial cues, implementing probabilistic coding for sound localization.",

    "abstract": "A brain-computer interface that decodes continuous language from non-invasive recordings would have many scientific and practical applications. Currently, however, decoders that reconstruct continuous language use invasive recordings from surgically implanted electrodes1-3, while decoders that use non-invasive recordings can only identify stimuli from among a small set of letters, words, or phrases4-7. Here we introduce a non-invasive decoder that reconstructs continuous natural language from cortical representations of semantic meaning8 recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Given novel brain recordings, this decoder generates intelligible word sequences that recover the meaning of perceived speech, imagined speech, and even silent videos, demonstrating that a single language decoder can be applied to a range of semantic tasks. To study how language is represented across the brain, we tested the decoder on different cortical networks, and found that natural language can be separately decoded from multiple cortical networks in each hemisphere. As brain-computer interfaces should respect mental privacy9, we tested whether successful decoding requires subject cooperation, and found that subject cooperation is required both to train and to apply the decoder. Our study demonstrates that continuous language can be decoded from non-invasive brain recordings, enabling future multipurpose brain-computer interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic scores (PGS) have limited portability across different groupings of individuals (e.g., by genetic ancestries and/or social determinants of health), preventing their equitable use. PGS portability has typically been assessed using a single aggregate population-level statistic (e.g., R2), ignoring inter-individual variation within the population. Here we evaluate PGS accuracy at individual-level resolution, independent of its annotated genetic ancestries. We show that PGS accuracy varies between individuals across the genetic ancestry continuum in all ancestries, even within traditionally \"homogeneous\" genetic ancestry clusters. Using a large and diverse Los Angeles biobank (ATLAS, N= 36,778) along with the UK Biobank (UKBB, N= 487,409), we show that PGS accuracy decreases along a continuum of genetic ancestries in all considered populations and the trend is well-captured by a continuous measure of genetic distance (GD) from the PGS training data; Pearson correlation of -0.95 between GD and PGS accuracy averaged across 84 traits. When applying PGS models trained in UKBB \"white British\" individuals to European-ancestry individuals of ATLAS, individuals in the highest GD decile have 14% lower accuracy relative to the lowest decile; notably the lowest GD decile of Hispanic/Latino American ancestry individuals showed similar PGS performance as the highest GD decile of European ancestry ATLAS individuals. GD is significantly correlated with PGS estimates themselves for 82 out of 84 traits, further emphasizing the importance of incorporating the continuum of genetic ancestry in PGS interpretation. Our results highlight the need for moving away from discrete genetic ancestry clusters towards the continuum of genetic ancestries when considering PGS and their applications.",
