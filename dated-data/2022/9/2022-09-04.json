    "abstract": "Drought severely damages crop production, even under conditions so mild that the leaves show no signs of wilting. However, it is unclear how field-grown plants respond to mild drought. Here, we show through 6 years of field trials that ridges are a useful experimental tool to mimic mild drought stress in the field. Mild drought reduces inorganic phosphate levels in the leaves to activate the phosphate starvation response in soybean plants in the field. Using Arabidopsis thaliana and its mutant plants grown in pots under controlled environments, we demonstrate that phosphate starvation response (PSR) occurs before abscisic acid response under progressive mild drought and that PSR plays a crucial role in plant growth under mild drought. Our observations in the field and laboratory using model crop and experimental plants provide insight into the molecular response to mild drought in field-grown plants and the relationship between nutrition and drought stress response.",

    "abstract": "Differential abundance analysis is an essential and commonly used tool to characterize the difference between microbial communities. However, identifying differentially abundant microbes remains a challenging problem because the observed microbiome data is inherently compositional, excessive sparse, and distorted by experimental bias. Besides these major challenges, the results of differential abundance analysis also depend largely on the choice of analysis unit, adding another practical complexity to this already complicated problem. In this work, we introduce a new differential abundance test called the MsRDB test, which embeds the sequences into a metric space and integrates a multi-scale adaptive strategy for utilizing spatial structure to identify differentially abundant microbes. Compared with existing methods, the MsRDB test can detect differentially abundant microbes at the finest resolution offered by data and provide adequate detection power while being robust to zero counts, compositional effect, and experimental bias in the microbial compositional data set. Applications to both simulated and real microbial compositional data sets demonstrate the usefulness of the MsRDB test.",

    "abstract": "Abscisic acid (ABA) drives stomatal closure to minimize water loss due to transpiration in response to drought. We examined the subcellular location of ABA increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in guard cells that drive stomatal closure. ABA-dependent increases in fluorescence of the generic ROS sensor, dichlorofluorescein (DCF), were observed in mitochondria, chloroplasts, cytosol, and nuclei. The ABA response in all these locations were lost in an ABA-insensitive quintuple receptor mutant. The ABA-increased fluorescence in mitochondria of both DCF and an H2O2-selective probe, Peroxy Orange 1 (PO1), colocalized with Mitotracker Red. ABA treatment of guard cells transformed with the genetically-encoded H2O2 reporter targeted to the cytoplasm (roGFP2-Orp1), or mitochondria (mt-roGFP2-Orp1), revealed H2O2 increases. Consistent with mitochondrial ROS changes functioning in stomatal closure, we found that guard cells of a mutant with mitochondrial defects, abo6, have elevated ABA-induced ROS in mitochondria and enhanced stomatal closure. These effects were phenocopied with rotenone, which increased mitochondrial ROS. In contrast, the mitochondrially targeted antioxidant, MitoQ, dampened ABA effects on mitochondrial ROS accumulation and stomatal closure in Col-0 and reversed the guard cell closure phenotype of the abo6 mutant. ABA-induced ROS accumulation in guard cell mitochondria was lost in mutants in genes encoding Respiratory Burst Oxidase Homolog (RBOH) enzymes and reduced by treatment with the RBOH inhibitor VAS2870, consistent with RBOH machinery acting in ABA-increased ROS in guard cell mitochondria. These results demonstrate that ABA elevates H2O2 accumulation in guard cell mitochondria to promote stomatal closure.\n\nOne sentence summaryGenetically encoded biosensors and chemical probes revealed ABA-dependent increases in hydrogen peroxide, a reactive oxygen species with signaling activity, in guard cell cytoplasm and mitochondria.",

Recently, T. harzianum IOC-3844 (Th3844) and T. harzianum CBMAI-0179 (Th0179) demonstrated great potential in the enzymatic conversion of lignocellulose into fermentable sugars. Herein, we performed whole-genome sequencing and assembly of the Th3844 and Th0179 strains. To assess the genetic diversity within the genus Trichoderma, the results of both strains were compared with strains of T. atroviride CBMAI-00020 (Ta0020) and T. reesei CBMAI-0711 (Tr0711). The sequencing coverage value of all genomes evaluated in this study was higher than that of previously reported genomes for the same species of Trichoderma. The resulting assembly revealed total lengths of 40 Mb (Th3844), 39 Mb (Th0179), 36 Mb (Ta0020), and 32 Mb (Tr0711). A genome-wide phylogenetic analysis provided details on the relationships of the newly sequenced species with other Trichoderma species. Structural variants revealed genomic rearrangements among Th3844, Th0179, Ta0020, and Tr0711 relative to the T. reesei QM6a reference genome and showed the functional effects of such variants. In conclusion, the findings presented herein allow the visualization of genetic diversity in the evaluated strains and offer opportunities to explore such fungal genomes in future biotechnological and industrial applications.",

    "abstract": "Chronic opioid exposure causes structural and functional changes in brain circuits, which may contribute to opioid use disorders. Synaptic cell-adhesion molecules are prime candidates for mediating this opioid-evoked plasticity. Neuroligin-3 (NL3) is an X-linked postsynaptic adhesion protein that shapes synaptic function at multiple sites in the mesolimbic dopamine system. We therefore studied how genetic knockout of NL3 alters responses to chronic morphine in male mice. Constitutive NL3 knockout caused a persistent reduction in psychomotor sensitization after chronic morphine exposure and changed in the topography of locomotor stimulation produced by morphine. This latter change was recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion of NL3 from cells expressing the Drd1 dopamine receptor, whereas reduced psychomotor sensitization was recapitulated by conditional genetic deletion from dopamine neurons. Without NL3 expression, dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area exhibited diminished activation following chronic morphine exposure, by measuring in vivo calcium signals with fiber photometry. This altered pattern of dopamine neuron activity may be driven by aberrant forms of opioid-evoked synaptic plasticity in the absence of NL3: dopamine neurons lacking NL3 showed weaker synaptic inhibition at baseline, which was subsequently strengthened after chronic morphine. In total, our study highlights neurobiological adaptations in dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area that correspond with increased behavioral sensitivity to opioids, and further suggests that NL3 expression by dopamine neurons provides a molecular substrate for opioid-evoked adaptations in brain function and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Different sleep states have been shown to be vital for a variety of brain function, including learning, memory, and skill consolidation. However, our understanding of neural dynamics during sleep and the role of prominent LFP frequency bands remain incomplete. To elucidate such dynamics and changes between different behavioral states we collected multichannel LFP and spike data in primary motor cortex of unconstrained macaques for up to 24 hours using the Neurochip3. Each 8 second bin of time was classified into awake and moving (Move), awake and at rest (Rest), REM sleep (REM), or non-REM sleep (NREM) by using dimensionality reduction and clustering on the average spectral density and the acceleration of the head. LFP power showed high delta during NREM, high theta during REM, and high beta when the animal was awake. Cross-frequency phase-amplitude coupling typically showed higher coupling for deeper sleep between all pairs of frequency bands. Two notable exceptions were high delta-high gamma and theta-high gamma coupling during Move, and high theta-beta coupling during REM. Sorted single units showed decreased firing rate with deeper sleep, though with higher \"bursty\" patterns during NREM compared to other states. Spike-LFP synchrony showed high delta synchrony during Move, and higher coupling with all other frequency bands with deeper sleep.\n\nThese results altogether are consistent with previous findings showing reactivation of cortical circuitry during sleep, which may be moderated by delta band LFP.",

    "abstract": "This modeling study investigates whether an orderly convergence of neuronal selectivities from cortical areas V1 and V2 can produce curvature selective receptive fields found in area V4. A model of the ventral visual pathway from V1 to V4 is composed of approximately 500,000 individual integrate and fire units. The V1 and V2 models are based on recent findings about the composition of V2 receptive fields. A novel proposal is made for how V4 neurons may create selectivity for varying degrees of local curvature through the orderly convergence of afferent inputs from V2. The study employs a novel method for simulating individual spikes in large numbers of model neurons using tensor programming and GPU hardware: Assuming that convergent functional micro-architectural patterns repeat in topographically organized visual space, the details of individual unit depolarization and spike time is modeled using convolution operations combined with a model for the time course of post-synaptic potentials. The few parameters in the model are set manually, and this is sufficient to qualitatively reproduce the V4 recordings. This demonstrates that convolution technologies can be used for the realistic simulation of large numbers of neurons at an intermediate level of biological detail.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the patterns of changes in brain function and structure due to various disorders and diseases is of utmost importance. There have been numerous efforts toward successful biomarker discovery for complex brain disorders by evaluating neuroimaging datasets with novel analytical frameworks. However, due to the multi-faceted nature of the disorders involving a wide and overlapping range of symptoms as well as complex changes in structural and functional brain networks, it is increasingly important to devise computational frameworks that can consider the underlying patterns of heterogeneous changes with specific target assessments, at the same time producing a summarizing output from the high-dimensional neuroimaging data. While various machine learning approaches focus on diagnostic prediction, many learning frameworks analyze important features at the level of brain regions involved in prediction using supervised methods. Unsupervised learning methods have also been utilized to break down the neuroimaging features into lower dimensional components. However, most learning frameworks either do not consider the target assessment information while extracting brain subspaces, or can extract only higher dimensional importance associations as an ordered list of involved features, making manual interpretation at the level of subspaces difficult. We present a novel multimodal active subspace learning framework to understand various subspaces within the brain that are associated with changes in particular biological and cognitive traits. For a given cognitive or biological trait, our framework performs a decomposition of the feature importances to extract robust multimodal subspaces that define the most significant change in the given trait. Through a rigorous cross-validation procedure on an Alzheimers disease (AD) dataset, we show that our framework can extract subspaces covering both functional and structural modalities, which are specific to a given clinical assessment (like memory and other cognitive skills) and also retain predictive performance in standard machine learning algorithms. We show that our framework not only uncovers AD-related brain regions (e.g., hippocampus, entorhinal cortex) in the associated brain subspaces, but also enables an automated identification of multiple underlying structural and functional sub-systems of the brain that collectively characterize changes in memory and cognitive skill proficiency related to brain disorders like AD.",

Hence, an extensive knowledge of the structural dynamics of the receptor is critical for the development of therapeutics. Here, we target the adenosine A1 receptor (A1R), for which a negligible number of drugs have been approved. We combine molecular dynamics simulations, enhanced sampling techniques, network theory and pocket detection to decipher the activation pathway of A1R, decode the allosteric networks and identify transient pockets. The A1R activation pathway reveal hidden intermediate and pre-active states together with the inactive and fully-active states observed experimentally. The protein energy networks computed throughout these conformational states successfully unravel the extra and intracellular allosteric centers and the communication pathways that couples them. We observe that the allosteric networks are dynamic, being increased along activation and fine-tuned in presence of the trimeric G-proteins. Overlap of transient pockets and energy networks uncover how the allosteric coupling between pockets and distinct functional regions of the receptor is altered along activation. By an in-depth analysis of the bridge between activation pathway, energy networks and transient pockets, we provide a further understanding of A1R. This information can be useful to ease the design of allosteric modulators for A1R.",

    "abstract": "Germline genetic variations can alter cellular differentiation, potentially impacting the response of immune cells to inflammatory challenges. Current variant- and gene-based methods in mouse and human models have established associations with disease phenotypes; however, the underlying mechanisms at the cellular level are less well-understood. Immunophenotyping by multi-parameter flow cytometry, and more recently mass cytometry, has allowed high-resolution identification and characterization of hematopoietic cells. The obtained characterization yields increased dimensionality; however, conventional analysis workflows have been inefficient, incomplete, or unreliable. In this work, we develop a comprehensive machine learning framework - MDL4Cyto - that is tailored to the analysis of mass cytometry data, incorporating statistical, unsupervised learning, and supervised learning models. The statistical modeling can be used to illuminate cell fate decision and cell-type dynamics. The unsupervised learning models along with complementary marker enrichment analyses highlight genetic perturbations that are significantly associated with alterations in cell populations in the hematopoietic system. Furthermore, our supervised learning models, including deep learning and tree-based algorithms, address the bottleneck to data pre-processing that characterizes conventional workflows and generate inferences (e.g., on marker/cell-type interactions) from raw experimental characterization. Notably, we reveal a close relationship among network design, prediction performance, and the underlying biological context. We show that the network architecture extracted from the differentiation cascade of the investigated biological system yields enhanced prediction performance.

In both conditions, activity during the early stimulus period was temporally coordinated with the preferred stimulus. However, while network activity increased in the preferred condition, network activity was increasingly suppressed in the nonpreferred condition over the stimulus period.

    "abstract": "Antibiotic treatment significantly impacts the human gut microbiota, but quantitative understanding of how antibiotics affect community diversity is lacking. Here, we build on classical ecological models of resource competition to investigate community responses to antibiotic-induced species-specific death rates. Our analyses highlight the complex dependence of species coexistence that can arise from the interplay of resource competition and antibiotic activity, independent of other biological mechanisms. We show that resource competition can cause richness to change non-monotonically as antibiotic concentrations are increased. We identified resource competition structures that cause richness to depend on the order of sequential application of antibiotics (non-transitivity), and the emergence of synergistic and antagonistic effects under simultaneous application of multiple antibiotics (non-additivity). These complex behaviors can be prevalent, especially when generalist consumers are targeted. Communities can be prone to either synergism or antagonism, but typically not both, and antagonism is more common. Furthermore, we identify a striking overlap in competition structures that lead to non-transitivity during antibiotic sequences and those that lead to non-additivity during antibiotic combination, suggesting that our analysis is broadly applicable across a wide range of clinically relevant antibiotic treatment schemes. In sum, our results will facilitate the engineering of community dynamics via deleterious agents.",

    "abstract": "The recurrent evolution of resistance to cardiotonic steroids (CTS) across diverse animals most frequently involves convergent amino-acid substitutions to the H1-H2 extracellular loop of Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA). Previous work established that hystricognath rodents (e.g. chinchilla) and pterocliform birds (sandgrouse) have convergently evolved amino-acid insertions in the H1-H2 loop, but their functional significance is not known. Using protein engineering, we show that these insertions have distinct effects on CTS resistance of NKA in the two lineages that strongly depend on intramolecular interactions with other residues. Removing the insertion in the chinchilla lineage unexpectedly increases CTS resistance and decreases NKA activity. In the sandgrouse lineage, the insertion works in concert with the substitution Q111R to increase CTS resistance while maintaining wild-type ATPase activity levels. Molecular docking simulations provide additional insight into the biophysical mechanisms responsible for the context-specific CTS insensitivity of the enzyme. Our results highlight the diversity of genetic substrates that underlie CTS insensitivity in vertebrate NKA and reveal how amino-acid insertions can alter the phenotypic effects of point mutations at key sites in the same protein domain.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen is a vital molecule involved in regulating development, homeostasis, and disease. The oxygen levels in tissue vary from 1 to 8% with deviations having major biological consequences. In this work, we developed an approach to encapsulate enzymes and nanozymes, at an unprecedented loading capacity, which precisely controls the oxygen content in cell culture. Here, a single microcapsule is able to locally perturb the oxygen balance, and varying the concentration and distribution of matrix embedded microcapsules provides spatiotemporal control. We demonstrate attenuation of hypoxia signaling in populations of stem cells, cancer cells, endothelial cells, and cancer spheroids. Capsule containing hydrogel films applied to chick chorioallantoic membranes encourage neovascularization, providing scope for topical treatments or hydrogel wound dressings. We further demonstrate versatility by loading capsules with ceria nanorods as \"nanozymes\" to modulate active oxygen species with potential as a cytoprotective treatment. The approach can be used in multiple formats, including deposition in hydrogels, as granular solids for 3D bioprinting, and as injectable biomaterials. Overall, this platforms simplicity and flexibility will prove useful for fundamental studies of oxygen-mediated processes in virtually any in vitro or in vivo format, with scope for inclusion in biomedical materials where controlling hypoxia may be clinically advantageous.",

    "abstract": "The chromatin in eukaryotic cells plays a fundamental role in all processes during a cells life cycle. This nucleoprotein is normally tightly packed but needs to be unpacked for expression and division. The linker histones are critical for such packaging processes and while most experimental and simulation works recognize their crucial importance, the focus is nearly always set on the nucleosome as the basic chromatin building block. Linker histones can undergo several modifications, but only few studies on their ubiquitylation have been conducted. Mono-ubiquitylated linker histones (HUb), while poorly understood, are expected to influence DNA compaction. The size of ubiquitin and the globular domain of the linker histone are comparable and one would expect an increased disorder upon ubiquitylation of the linker histone. However, the formation of higher order chromatin is not hindered and ubiquitylation of the linker histone may even promote gene expression. Structural data on chromatosomes is rare and HUb has never been modeled in a chromatosome so far. Descriptions of the chromatin complex with HUb would greatly benefit from computational structural data. In this study we generate molecular dynamics simulation data for six differently linked HUb variants with the help of a sampling scheme tailored to drive the exploration of phase space. We identify conformational sub-states of the six HUb variants using the sketch-map algorithm for dimensionality reduction and iterative HDBSCAN for clustering on the excessively sampled, shallow free energy landscapes. We present a highly efficient geometric scoring method to identify sub-states of HUb that fit into the nucleosome. We predict HUb conformations inside a nucleosome using on-dyad and off-dyad chromatosome structures as reference and show that unbiased simulations of HUb produce significantly more fitting than non-fitting HUb conformations. A tetranucleosome array is used to show that ubiquitylation can even occur in chromatin without too much steric clashes.\n\nAuthor summaryIn eukaryotic cells the linker histones play a crucial role in the formation of higher order nucleoprotein complex of DNA, especially for the arrangement of the nucleosomes. Histones can undergo several modifications, but modification of a linker histone with a single udiquitin (mono-ubiquitylation) remains one of the least understood epigenetic modifications. One reason is the inaccessibility of homogeneously modified linker histones for experimental methods, which are crucial for distinct studies. We combine molecular dynamics simulations with machine learning-based approaches to study the influence of mono-ubiquitylation in linker histones on DNA interaction and their ability to form higher order chromatin structures. We were able to determine the probable states in six differently linked histone-ubiquitin complexes via accelerating classical molecular dynamics simulations and using advanced state characterization techniques. As it is computationally unfeasible to simulate the whole chromatosome with different modified histones we developed efficient geometric scoring technique to select biologically relevant structures of all six mono-ubiquitylated linker histone that can bound to nucleosome.",

We performed differential expression and normalization analysis of miRNAs. Cox linear regression model confirmed the differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and clinical medical parameters related to overall survival (OS). The role of target genes of DEmiRNAs was determined according to the role enrichment analysis.\n\nResultsWe obtained a total of 7531 DEmRNAs and 267 DEmRNAs, of which 185 DEmRNAs were down-regulated and 82 DEmRNAs were up-regulated. We randomly divided the LMNGC cases (n=291) into a training group (n=207) and a test group (n=84). The results showed that a total of 103, 11, 13 and 83 overlapping genes were associated with hsa-mir-141-3p, hsa-mir-4664-3p, hsa-mir-125b-5p and hsa-mir-7-5p, respectively. Kaplan-Meier determined that these four miRNAs can effectively distinguish high-risk and low-risk groups, and have a good indicator role (all p<0.05). Multivariate cox regression analysis also showed that EMT-related miRNA predictive model and lymph node metastasis were both prognostic risk factors (all p<0.05). The ROC curve showed that this feature had high accuracy (AUC>0.7, p<0.05). In addition, KEGG analysis showed that EMT-related pathways were mainly enriched in HIF-1 signaling pathway and focal adhesion.\n\nConclusionsOur study demonstrated that EMT-related miRNAs could serve as independent prognostic markers in pN1-3 GC patients.",

Effects of microgravity have been perfectly simulated in the rat hindlimb unloading (HU) model. This study was planned to assess the structure-function relationship of the carotid artery before and after HU of 14 days\n\nMaterial and methodsThis study was done in Department of Physiology, AIIMS, New Delhi. 18 male Wistar rats weighing 250-300 gm were randomly divided into control and hindlimb unloaded groups and housed in separate cages for 14 days. Body weight, food and water intake was measured every day. The pelvic suspension method was used to simulate microgravity. Blood pressure was recorded directly from the carotid artery.ECG was recorded in lead II configuration. A graph was plotted of MAP v RRI and the slope was taken. Linear regression of mean arterial pressure and RR interval used to derive the Baroreflex sensitivity.Vessel wall thickness, intimal thickness, smooth muscle cell layer thickness & luminal diameter were observed after H&E staining. Ultrathin sectioning and counter-staining was done for electron microscopy and changes in endothelial thickness, elastic lamina, and deeper artery structures were observed. Statistical analysis was done using Graphpad Prism (version 9.0). Unpaired t-test was applied.\n\nResultsWe found significant differences were observed Food intake(p <0.001) Body weight(p <0.001), Heart rate (p=0.031), BRS (p= 0.026), HRV:R-R interval (p=0.0246), SDSD (p=0.0001),RMSD (p=0.0001),VLF(p=0.001),HF (p=0.0054), LF/HF Ratio (p= 0.0001).we did not found significant changes inWater intake, MAP, SBP, DBP, LFT, RFT, Vessel wall thickness(m), Luminal Diameter (m), Intimal thickness(m), Smooth muscle thickness(m), in H&E staining and in electron microscopy.\n\nConclusionChronic microgravity simulation using pelvic suspension showed a decrease in BRS, however 15 days are not insufficient to produce any structural changes in the carotid artery. BRS changes are accompanied by change vascular vasoconstriction and vasodilation properties which are due to alteration in the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow.",

A major hypothesis in the field posits that the activity of neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) plays an important role in mediating behavioral flexibility. To test this hypothesis, we developed a novel context-dependent bilateral tactile detection task where mice responded to left and right whisker deflections in a rule-dependent manner and exhibited varying degrees of flexible switching behavior. Recording from optogenetically-tagged neurons in the LC during task performance revealed a prominent graded correlation between baseline LC activity and behavioral flexibility, where higher baseline activity following a rule change was associated with faster behavioral switching to the new rule. Increasing baseline LC activity with optogenetic activation improved task performance and accelerated task switching. Overall, our study provides strong evidence to demonstrate that LC activity mediates behavioral flexibility.",

In this report, we used the Closed Head Injury Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) to study the effects of a single moderate-severe TBI in rTg4510 mice, a mouse model of tauopathy. Fifteen male rTg4510 mice were impacted at 4.0J at 4-mo of age using interfaced CHIMERA and compared to sham controls. Immediately after injury, moderate-severe TBI induced significant mortality (7/15; 47%), and a prolonged duration of loss of righting reflex. At 2-mo post-injury, surviving mice displayed significant histological evidence of microgliosis (Iba1) and axonal injury (Neurosilver). Western blotting showed that TBI mice had a reduced p-GSK-3{beta} (S9):GSK-3{beta} ratio, suggesting greater tau kinase activity. However, tauopathy in surviving TBI mice showed a divergent response, with 3/8 mice having a very low level of tau protein in brain lysates (i.e. lower than sham), and were thus analyzed separately from the other 5/8 TBI mice that maintained the expected level of total tau. Compared to sham controls, TBI mice with normal tau levels had increased p-tau (PHF1 and AT8), increased autophagolysosome accumulation (p62 and Cathepsin D) and decreased hippocampal size. These findings were not observed in TBI mice with low total tau levels. These observations suggest that TBI leads to chronic white matter injury and altered GSK-3{beta} activity. However, post-injury tauopathy and autophagolysosome accumulation diverged in surviving mice through mechanisms that remain to be defined.",

    "abstract": "Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. With nearly 50 million incidences per year, it causes 11 million deaths worldwide annually, exceeding the 10 million total deaths caused by all tumors. Surprisingly, there is no specific drug available on market, explaining why it has a mortality rate as high as 22.5%. The lack of specific drug is mainly caused by the lack of understanding of how sepsis causes death. In this paper, I hypothesized that since energy production by mitochondria through respiration is not sustainable because the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during respiration damages mitochondria themselves, mitochondria in the immune system cannot meet the dramatic and long-lasting high level of energy requirement of the system during sepsis. The immune system uses up all the functional mitochondria in the body by inter-system mitochondria transfer (ISMT), which dumps its used, unfunctional, or oxidized mitochondria to and recruits functional mitochondria from other systems. ISMT leads to the lack of functional mitochondria, hence energy, in the brain and the heart, and eventually causes death of the body. The hypothesis was supported by three key results: First, 2.5 hours after sepsis induction, mtDNA copy number increased dramatically in the spleen, brain, muscle, and blood, but decreased dramatically in the liver, kidneys, and skin. Second, mice died from sepsis showed a severe decline of mitochondria function in the brain and the heart. Finally, a single injection of isolated functional mitochondria to mice with sepsis reduced the mortality rate compared to mice received inactivated mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "Despite the rich information of a cells physiological state encoded in the dynamic changes of cell-surface glycans, methods of capturing glycosylation states at the single-cell level are quite limited. Here we report a chemoenzymatic single-cell N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) detection method via tagging the LacNAc with a specific DNA barcode. Compared to the lectin-based glycan detection, the chemoenzymatic labeling does not change the transcriptional status of immune cells and is more compatible with scRNA-seq. Integrated analysis of LacNAc and transcriptome of T cells at a single-cell level reveals that the quantity of cell-surface LacNAc is significantly upregulated in activated CD8+ T cells but maintained at the basal level in quiescent CD8+ T cells (i.e., naive and central memory T cells). Further analysis confirms that the LacNAc level is positively correlated to the glycolytic activity of CD8+ T cells at all statues. Taken together, our study demonstrates the feasibility of chemoenzymatic detection of cell-surface glycan in single-cell RNA sequencing-based multiomics with information of TCR sequence and cell-surface epitopes (i.e., scTCR and CITE-seq) and offers a new way to characterize the biological role of glycan in diversified physiological states.",

We introduced mouse intestinal organoid crypts to study spindle orientation in a monolayered mammalian epithelium. Although spindles were planar in this tissue, mitotic cells remained elongated along the apico-basal axis and polarity complexes were segregated to basal poles, so that spindles oriented in an unconventional manner, orthogonal to both polarity and geometric cues. Using high-resolution 3D imaging, simulations, cell shape and cytoskeleton manipulations, we show that planar divisions resulted from a length-limitation in mitotic-phase astral microtubules which precludes them from interacting with basal polarity, and oriented spindles from the local geometry of apical domains. Accordingly, lengthening microtubules affected spindle planarity, cell positioning and crypt arrangement. We conclude that microtubule length regulation may serve as a key mechanism for spindles to sense local cell shapes and tissue forces to preserve mammalian epithelial architecture.",

    "abstract": "The shaping of epithelial tissues into functional organs often depend on asymmetries in mechanical tension present at the apical and basal sides of cells. Contraction of an actomyosin meshwork underlying the apical side of cells is known to generate apical tension. The basal side of cells is also associated with an actomyosin meshwork, but it is, in addition, connected to a specialized extracellular matrix, the basement membrane. However, how basal tension is generated, and the role of the basement membrane in this process, are not well understood. Here, using atomic force microscopy, we measure mechanical tension in the basal surface of the wing disc epithelium of Drosophila. We find that basal tension depends on both the actomyosin cytoskeleton and the basement membrane, and that it is proportional to lateral surface tension and hydrostatic pressure. Collagen IV turnover and mobility are slow indicating that the basement membrane can store elastic stresses. Our data suggest that elastic stresses in the basement membrane induced by basement membrane stretch are a key factor in the adjustment of basal tension. Hydrostatic pressure and lateral actomyosin contractility are two driving forces by which epithelial cells can maintain this basement membrane stretch.",

    "abstract": "Divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) cotransports ferrous iron and protons and is the primary mechanism for uptake of non-heme iron by enterocytes. Inhibitors are potentially useful as therapeutic agents to treat iron overload disorders such as hereditary hemochromatosis or {beta}-thalassemia intermedia, provided that inhibition can be restricted to the duodenum. We used a calcein quench assay to identify human DMT1 (hDMT1) inhibitors. Dimeric constructs were made to generate more potent compounds with low systemic exposure. Direct block of DMT1 was confirmed by voltage clamp measurements. The lead compound, XEN602, strongly inhibits dietary iron uptake in both rats and pigs, yet has negligible systemic exposure. Efficacy is maintained for >2 weeks in a rat subchronic dosing assay. Doses that lowered iron content in the spleen and liver by >50% had no effect on the tissue content of other divalent cations except for cobalt. XEN602 represents a powerful pharmacological tool for understanding the physiological function of DMT1.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThis report introduces methodology to develop potent, gut-restricted inhibitors of DMT1 and identifies XEN602 as a suitable compound for in vivo studies. We also report novel animal models to quantify the inhibition of dietary uptake of iron in both rodents and pigs. This research shows that inhibition of DMT1 is a promising means to treat iron overload disorders.",

    "abstract": "Language comprehension involves the construction of complex mental representations, i.e., \"event representations\", reflecting current events or situation models. The construction of these representations requires manipulation of both semantic and episodic content and has been widely associated with the functioning of the posterior medial network, a subsystem of the default network. However, it is still unknown the extent to which activity in posterior medial network reflects construction of the variable episodic versus semantic content of event representations. In this fMRI study, we establish the unique neural correlates of (1) episodic richness and (2) semantic coherence measured during a narrative reading task. Interestingly, we observed a functional fractionation within the posterior medial network in terms of brain regions whose activity was modulated by semantic or episodic content. Specifically, the number of episodic details in the narratives modulated the activity in the left angular gyrus and the retrosplenial cortex/ventral posterior cingulate cortex. Semantic coherence, in contrast, modulated neural responses in the right anterior temporal lobe/middle temporal gyrus, but also in brain regions within the posterior medial network, such as the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex. These results provide the first demonstration of functional dissociations within the posterior medial network in terms of brain regions involved in the construction of semantic versus episodic representational content during a language comprehension task.\n\nSignificance StatementThe construction of \"event representations\", which is crucial to understand the world around us, predict the future and make plans, requires manipulation of both semantic and episodic information. The functioning of the posterior medial network has been tightly linked to formation of event representations. However, it is unclear the extent to which activity in this network reflects construction of the variable episodic versus semantic content of event representations. The present study provides the first demonstration of functional dissociations within posterior medial network in terms of brain regions involved in construction of semantic versus episodic representational content during language comprehension. These findings represent a first step towards understanding how episodic and semantic memory systems operate during the construction of event representations.",

Here, we provide an atlas of chromatin accessibility and gene expression in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei across 25 distinct human cortical and subcortical brain regions from 6 neurotypical controls. We identified extensive gene expression and chromatin accessibility differences across brain regions, including variation in alternative promoter-isoform usage and enhancer-promoter interactions. Genes with distinct promoter-isoform usage across brain regions are strongly enriched for neuropsychiatric disease risk variants. Using an integrative approach, we characterized the function of the brain region-specific chromatin co-accessibility and gene-coexpression modules that are robustly associated with genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders. In addition, we identified a novel set of genes that is enriched for disease risk variants but is independent of cell-type specific gene expression and known susceptibility pathways. Our results provide a valuable resource for studying molecular regulation across multiple regions of the human brain and suggest a unique contribution of epigenetic modifications from subcortical areas to neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Radial neuronal migration is a key neurodevelopmental event for proper cortical laminar organization. Newly born neurons migrate in a complex three-dimensional environment generated by the extracellular matrix (ECM), secreted factors, and neighboring cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the ECM controls radial migration remain largely unknown. We herein identified neurocan (NCAN), a risk factor for neuropsychiatric disorders, as a major chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan produced by developing cortical neurons. NCAN binds to both radial glial cell-derived tenascin-C (TNC) and hyaluronan (HA), a large linear polysaccharide, forming a ternary complex of NCAN, TNC, and HA. Developing cortical neurons make contact with the ternary complex during migration. The enzymatic or genetic disruption of the ternary complex impairs radial migration by suppressing the multipolar-to-bipolar transition. Furthermore, TNC in the ternary complex promotes neuronal morphological maturation. The present results provide evidence for the cooperative role of neuron- and radial glial cell-derived ECM molecules in cortical development.",

    "abstract": "Cultured meat technologies leverage the proliferation and differentiation of animal-derived stem cells ex vivo to produce edible tissues for human consumption in a sustainable fashion. However, skeletal muscle is a dynamic and highly complex tissue, involving the interplay of numerous mono- and multinucleated cells, including muscle fibres, satellite cells (SCs) and fibro-adipogenic progenitors (FAPs), and recreation of the tissue in vitro thus requires the characterisation and manipulation of a broad range of cell types. Here, we use a single-cell RNA sequencing approach to characterise cellular heterogeneity within bovine muscle and muscle-derived cell cultures over time. Using this data, we identify numerous distinct cell type, and develop robust protocols for the easy purification and proliferation of several of these populations. We note overgrowth of undesirable cell types within heterogeneous proliferative cultures as a barrier to efficient cultured meat production, and use transcriptomics to identify conditions that favour the growth of SCs in the context of serum-free medium. Combining RNA velocities computed in silico with time-resolved flow cytometric analysis, we characterise dynamic subpopulations and transitions between active, quiescent, and committed states of SCs, and demonstrate methods for modulation of these states during long-term proliferative cultures. This work provides an important reference for advancing our knowledge of bovine skeletal muscle biology, and its application in the development of cultured meat technologies.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic plasticity relies on rapid, yet spatially precise signaling to alter synaptic strength. Arc is a brain enriched protein that is rapidly expressed during learning-related behaviors and is essential for regulating metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated long-term depression (mGluR-LTD). We previously showed that disrupting the ubiquitination capacity of Arc enhances mGluR-LTD; however, the mechanism by which this occurs and its consequences on other mGluR-mediated signaling events is unknown. Here we show that disrupting Arc ubiquitination on key amino acid residues leads to derangements in Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) during pharmacological activation of Group I mGluRs. These alterations were observed in all neuronal subregions except secondary branchpoints. Deficits in Arc ubiquitination increased Arc self-association and enhanced its interaction with calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIb (CaMKIIb) and constitutively active forms of CaMKII. Notably, these interactions were also excluded at secondary branchpoints. Finally, disruptions in Arc ubiquitination were found to increase Arc interaction with the integral ER protein Calnexin. These results suggest a previously unknown role for Arc ubiquitination in the fine tuning of ER-mediated Ca2+ signaling that is needed for mGluR-LTD, which in turn, may regulate CaMKII and its interactions with Arc.",

    "abstract": "Microglia are important mediators of neuroinflammation that underlies neuropathic pain. However, the molecular checkpoints controlling microglial reactivity are not well-understood. We investigated the role of Orai1 channels for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation following nerve injury and find that deletion of Orai1 in microglia attenuates Ca2+ signaling and the production of inflammatory cytokines by proalgesic agonists. Conditional deletion of Orai1 attenuated microglia proliferation in the dorsal horn, spinal cytokines levels, and potentiation of excitatory neurotransmission following peripheral nerve injury. These cellular effects were accompanied by mitigation of pain hyperalgesia in Orai1 knockout mice. A small-molecule Orai1 inhibitor, CM4620, similarly mitigated allodynia in male mice. Surprisingly, these protective effects were not seen in female mice, revealing striking sexual dimorphism in Orai1 regulation of microglial reactivity and hyperalgesia. These findings indicate that Orai1 channels are key regulators of the sexually dimorphic role of microglia for the neuroinflammation that underlies neuropathic pain.",

    "abstract": "Electrospray ionization (ESI) prevents the analyte being split into fragments and is widely used to analyze biomolecules. Nanodiscs provide a native-like environment for membrane proteins, while making them accessible in aqueous solution for analysis. We performed microsecond (s) molecular dynamics simulations at different temperatures, to provide atomistic insight in the release of intact nanodiscs from charged nano-droplets, the late stage of the ESI process. Two distinct main scenarios, at-center and off-center, were observed. The at-center scenario follows the charged residue model, and in the process the nanodisc stays well in the droplet interior, with the membrane scaffold protein (MSP) keeping its annular geometry. As solvent evaporates, lipids turn over to protect the hydrophilic surface. The off-center scenario conforms to a hybrid model of the charged residue model and chain ejection model. The nanodisc migrates to the water/air interface, leading to lipids escaping from the dissociated dimer and the partial ejection of one monomer of MSP. A diversity of morphologies of product gaseous ions was observed, as evidenced by their structural details, collision cross sections and moments of inertia. Our results are in reasonable agreement with results of mass spectrometry in mass-to-charge ratio, charge state and collision cross section. Our work displays the first atomistic view of a heterogeneous system, a lipid nanodisc, releasing from highly charged nano-droplets into the gas phase, which may provide structural supports for the interpretation of mass spectra of complicated systems. What we observe in our simulations could also be generalized to other protein-lipid systems.",

The sonic hedgehog (SHH) subtype accounts for 30% of MB cases and likely arises from mutations in granule cell precursors (GCPs), neuronal progenitors of the cerebellar cortex that differentiate into granule neurons. SHH MB is extremely heterogeneous, but it is unknown whether this heterogeneity relates to the tumors developmental origins. To investigate this question, we performed single-nucleus RNA-Sequencing on seven highly differentiated SHH MB with extensively nodular histology and observed malignant cells resembling each stage of granule neuron development. Using novel computational approaches, we connected these results to published datasets and found that established molecular subtypes of SHH MB are enriched for specific developmental cell types. Additionally, some genomic copy number variations are associated with certain developmental stages, and we observed distinct metabolic and histological profiles for tumors containing cells resembling late-stage granule neurons.

These are the synthesis of putrescine from ornithine, by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC); and the synthesis of putrescine from arginine by arginine decarboxylase, agmatine iminohydrolase (AIH) and N-carbamoylputrescine amidohydrolase (NLP1); or arginine decarboxylase and agmatinase. Several enzymes associated with putrescine synthesis have yet to be localized. Here we showed that ODC in soybeans and rice was localized to the ER. In rice, agmatinase is localized to the mitochondria. In A. thaliana there are five isoforms of AIH and three isoforms of NLP1. Stable GFP-tagged transformants of the longest isoforms of AIH and NLP1 showed that both proteins were localized to the ER in leaves and roots of A. thaliana. Four of the isoforms of AIH and all of the isoforms of NLP1 were localized to the ER. However, AIH1.4 was localized to both the ER and the chloroplast. Combining these results with other published data, reveal that putrescine synthesis is excluded from the cytoplasm and is spatially localized to the chloroplast, ER and likely the mitochondria. Synthesis of putrescine in the ER may facilitate cell to cell transport via plasmodesmata, or secretion via vesicles. Differential expression of these pathways may enable putrescine-mediated activation of hormone-responsive genes.",

We used continuous EEG to quantify \"speech neural tracking\" (i.e., TRFs, temporal response functions) to the television show audio track and additionally 8-12 Hz (alpha) brain rhythms commonly related to listening effort. Background noise at three different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), +5, +10, and +15 dB were presented to vary the difficulty of following the television show mimicking a natural noisy environment. The task included an additional condition of audio-only (no video). After each condition, participants subjectively rated listening demand and the degree of words and conversations they felt they could understand. Fifteen CI users reported progressively higher degrees of listening demand and less words and conversation with increasing background noise. Listening demand and conversation understanding in the audio-only condition was comparable to that of the highest noise condition (+5 dB). The addition of the background noise reduced the degree of speech neural tracking. Mixed effect modeling showed that listening demand and conversation understanding were correlated to cortical speech tracking such that high demand and low conversation understanding lower associated with lower amplitude TRFs. In the high noise condition, greater listening demand was negatively correlated to parietal alpha power such that higher demand was related to lower alpha power. No significant correlations were observed between TRF/alpha and clinical speech perception scores. These results are similar to previous findings showing little relationship between speech perception and quality of life in CI users. However, the physiological responses to complex natural speech may anticipate aspects of quality-of-life measures such as self-perceived listening demand.",

This work introduces a method to model rdMRI data signals by characterizing the apparent relaxation rate related to dMRI with different b-values. The proposed approach can extrapolate dMRI signals to ultra-long or ultra-short TEs to increase or reduce signals from intra-neurite water to improve the characterization of neurite microstructure without solving multi-compartment models.

The corridor concept was developed and investigated mainly by focusing on macroorganisms while microorganisms, the invisible majority of biodiversity, have been disregarded.\n\nCombining an experimental corridor-mesocosm design with high-throughput amplicon sequencing, we analyzed the effect of corridors on the dynamics of endospheric fungal assemblages associated with plant roots at metric scale over two years (i.e. at five time points).\n\nWe show that the plant symbiotic compartment was sensitive to corridor effects when the corridors were set up at a small spatial scale. The endospheric mycobiota of connected plants displayed higher species richness, lower beta-diversity, and a more deterministic assembly than the mycobiota of isolated plants. These effects became more pronounced with the development of host plants.\n\nBiotic corridors composed of host plants may thus play a key role in the spatial dynamics of microbial community and may influence microbial diversity and related ecological functions.",

Here we evaluate the roles of three sources of information - shifts in the red:far red (FR) ratio of light reflected off of potentially competing neighbors, induced metabolic changes to damage by insect herbivores, and induced changes to volatile organic compounds emitted from herbivore-damaged neighboring plants - to affect metabolic responses in the tall goldenrod, Solidago altissima. We address the hypothesis, that plants integrate the information available about competitors and herbivory to optimize metabolic responses to interacting stressors by exposing plants to the different types of environmental information in isolation and combination. We found strong interactions between the exposure to decreased Red:FR light ratios and damage on the induction of secondary metabolites (volatile and non-volatile) in the receiver plants. Similarly, the perception of VOCs emitted from neighboring plants was altered by the simultaneous exposure to spectral cues from neighbors. These results suggest that plants integrate spectral and chemical environmental cues to change the production and perception of volatile and non-volatile compounds and highlight the role of plant context-dependent metabolic responses in mediating population and community dynamics.\n\nHighlightPlants integrate spectral and chemical environmental cues to differentially induce production of volatile and non-volatile compounds",

    "abstract": "Although germline cells are considered to be functionally \"immortal\", both the germline and supporting somatic cells in the gonad within an organism will experience aging. With increased age at parenthood, the age-related decline in reproductive success has become an important biological issue for an aging population. However, molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive aging across sexes in vertebrates remain poorly understood. To decipher molecular drivers of vertebrate gonadal aging across sexes, we perform longitudinal characterization of the gonadal transcriptome throughout lifespan in the naturally short-lived African turquoise killifish (Nothobranchius furzeri). By combining mRNA-seq and small RNA-seq from 26 individuals, we characterize the aging gonads of young adult, middle-aged, and old female and male fish. We analyze changes in transcriptional patterns of genes, transposable elements (TEs), and piRNAs. We find that testes seem to undergo only marginal changes during aging. In contrast, in middle-aged ovaries, the timepoint associated with peak female fertility in this strain, PIWI pathway components are transiently downregulated, TE transcription is elevated, and piRNA levels generally decrease, suggesting that egg quality may already be declining at middle-age. Furthermore, we show that piRNA ping-pong biogenesis declines steadily with age in ovaries, while it is maintained in aging testes. To our knowledge, this dataset represents the most comprehensive transcriptomic dataset for vertebrate gonadal aging. This resource also highlights important pathways that are regulated during reproductive aging in either ovaries or testes, which could ultimately be leveraged to help restore aspects of youthful reproductive function.",

MADS-box family genes are involved in many plant growth and development processes. Here, we identified 3 MADS-box genes in tea plant belonging to the FLOWERING LOCUS C (CsFLC) family. We monitored CsFLC1 transcription throughout the year and found that CsFLC1 was expressed at a higher level during the winter bud dormancy and flowering phases. To clarify the function of CsFLC1, we developed transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants heterologously expressing 35S::CsFLC1. These lines bolted and bloomed earlier than the WT (Col-0), and the seed germination rate was inversely proportional to the increased CsFLC1 expression level. RNA-seq of 35S::CsFLC1 transgenic Arabidopsis showed that many genes responding to ageing, flower development and leaf senescence were affected, and phytohormone-related pathways were especially enriched. According to the results of hormone content detection and RNA transcript level analysis, CsFLC1 controls flowering time possibly by regulating SOC1, AGL42, SEP3 and AP3 and hormone signalling, accumulation and metabolism. Our results suggest that CsFLC1 might play dual roles in flowering and winter bud dormancy and provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of FLC in tea plants as well as other plant species.\n\nHighlightThree FLOWERING LOCUS C-like genes were identified in tea plants, among them CsFLC1 played dual roles in flowering and winter bud dormancy.",

    "abstract": "The fates of cells on the leaf surface depend on positional cues and environmental signals. New stomata are formed away from existing ones to prevent disadvantageous clustering, but how are the initial precursors positioned? Mature embryos do not have stomata, but we provide transcriptomic, imaging, and genetic evidence that Arabidopsis embryos engage known stomatal fate and patterning factors to create regularly spaced stomatal precursor cells. Analysis of embryos from 35 plant species indicates this trait is conserved across angiosperm clades. Embryonic stomatal patterning in Arabidopsis is established in three stages: first broad SPEECHLESS (SPCH) expression, then coalescence of SPCH and its targets into discrete domains, and finally one round of symmetric division to create stomatal precursors. Lineage progression is then halted until after germination. We show that embryonic stomatal pattern enables quick stomatal differentiation and photosynthetic activity upon germination but also guides the formation of additional stomata as the leaf expands. In addition, key stomatal regulators are prevented from driving the fate transitions they can induce after germination, revealing stage-specific layers of regulation that control lineage progression during embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Late blight caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans is a most devastating disease of potatoes (Solanum tuberosum). Its early detection is crucial for suppressing disease spread. Necrotic lesions are normally seen in leaves at 4 dpi (days post inoculation) when colonized cells are dead, but early detection of the initial biotrophic growth stage, when the pathogen feeds on living cells, is challenging. Here, the biotrophic growth phase of P. infestans was detected by whole-plant redox imaging of potato plants expressing chloroplast-targeted reduction-oxidation sensitive green fluorescent protein (chl-roGFP2). Clear spots on potato leaves with a lower chl-roGFP2 oxidation state were detected as early as 2 dpi, before any visual symptoms were recorded. These spots were particularly evident during light-to-dark transitions and reflected mislocalization of chl-roGFP2 outside the chloroplasts, demonstrating perturbation of the chloroplast import system by the pathogen. Image analysis based on machine learning enabled systematic identification and quantification of spots and unbiased classification of infected and uninfected leaves in inoculated plants. Comparing redox to chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed that infected leaf areas which exhibit mislocalized chl-roGFP2 also showed reduced non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and enhanced quantum PSII yield ({Phi}PSII) compared to the surrounding leaf areas. The data suggest that mislocalization of chloroplast-targeted proteins is an efficient marker of late blight infection and demonstrate how it can be utilized for nondestructive monitoring of the disease biotrophic stage using whole-plant redox imaging.",

Infected mice (n=24) were then treated with VX-765 or vehicle from day 1 post infection for 21 days. Blood and organs were collected at different time points, and analysed for inflammasome genes expression, cytokines levels, viral load, CD4 cell count, and total HIV-1 DNA.\n\nResultsExpression of caspase-1, NLRP3 and IL1-{beta} was increased in lymph nodes and bone marrow on day 1 and 3 post infection (mean fold change (FC) of 2.08, 3.23, and 6.05, p< 0.001 respectively between day 1 and 3). IFI16 expression peaked at D24 in lymph node and bone marrow (FC 1.49 and 1.64, p<0.05) and coincides with increased IL-18 levels in plasma (6.89 vs. 83.19 pg/ml, p=0.004). AIM2 and IFI16 expression correlated with increased viral load in tissues (p<0.005 for the spleen) and loss of CD4+ T cells percentage in blood (p<0.0001 for the spleen).

Here we investigated an m6A reader, YTHDC1, which has been shown to be recruited to the DNA-RNA hybrid at DNA damage sites and regulate homologous recombination (HR) during DNA damage repair. We found that YTHDC1 is subject to O-linked {beta}-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) modification at Ser396 upon DNA damage, which is pivotal for YTHDC1 chromatin binding and ionization radiation induced foci (IRIF) formation. RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations indicate that O-GlcNAcylation is vital for YTHDC1 to bind with m6A RNA. Fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching (FRAP) analysis revealed that YTHDC1 O-GlcNAcylation is essential for DNA damage-induced YTHDC1-m6A condensate formation. We further demonstrate that YTHDC1 O-GlcNAcylation promotes HR-mediated DNA damage repair and cell survival, probably through recruitment of Rad51 to the damage sites.

    "abstract": "Liver cancer, comprised mainly of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide and increasing in Western countries. We previously identified the transcription factor Zinc Fingers and Homeoboxes 2 (Zhx2) as a regulator of hepatic gene expression, and many Zhx2 target genes are dysregulated in HCC. Here, we investigate HCC in Zhx2-deficient mice using the Diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver tumor model. Our study using whole-body Zhx2 knock-out (Zhx2KO) mice revealed the complete absence of liver tumors 9 and 10 months after DEN exposure.Analysis soon after DEN treatment showed no differences in expression of the DEN bioactivating enzyme CYP2E1 and DNA polymerase delta 2, or in the numbers of {gamma}H2AX foci between Zhx2KO and wild-type (Zhx2wt) mice. The absence of Zhx2, therefore, did not alter DEN bioactivation or DNA damage. Zhx2KO livers showed fewer positive foci for Ki67 staining and reduced IL-6 and AKT2 expression compared to Zhx2wt livers, suggesting that Zhx2 loss reduces liver cell proliferation and may account for reduced tumor formation. Tumors were reduced but not absent in DEN-treated liver-specific Zhx2 knock-out mice, suggesting that Zhx2 acts in both hepatocytes and non-parenchymal cells to inhibit tumor formation. Analysis of data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Clinical Proteomic Tumor Consortium indicated that ZHX2 mRNA and protein levels were significantly higher in HCC patients and associated with clinical pathological parameters.\n\nConclusionsIn contrast to previous studies in human hepatoma cell lines and other HCC mouse models showing that Zhx2 acts as a tumor suppressor, our data indicate that Zhx2 acts as an oncogene in the DEN-induced HCC model and is consistent with the higher ZHX2 expression in HCC patients.",

Plasmids, DNA or in vitro transcribed RNA are often used to validate novel diagnostic workflows, however, they are poorly representative of clinical samples. RNA phage virus-like particles packaged with exogenous RNA have been used in clinical diagnostics as workflow controls, serving as surrogates for infectious viral particles. Comparable controls for DNA viruses are more challenging to produce, with analogous DNA phages being infectious and packaging of DNA within RNA phages requiring complex purification procedures and expensive chemical linkers. We present a simple and inexpensive method to produce MS2 virus-like particles, packaged with DNA, that makes use of affinity chromatography for purification and enzymatic production of exogenous DNA suitable for packaging. The produced virus-like particles were packaged with Hepatitis B Virus DNA and were then quantified using droplet digital PCR and calibrated against the WHO international standard using a commercial assay in an accredited clinical laboratory.",

Amongst these, we show installing H3K4me3 at promoters causally instructs transcription activation by hierarchically remodeling the chromatin landscape. We further dissect how DNA sequence motifs influence the transcriptional impact of chromatin marks, identifying switch-like and attenuative effects within distinct cis contexts. Finally, we examine the interplay of combinatorial modifications, revealing co-targeted H3K27me3 and H2AK119ub maximise silencing penetrance across single-cells.

    "abstract": "Adoptive T cell immune therapies mediate impressive clinical benefit in a fraction of patients, but anti-tumor effects are often limited by inadequate T cell potency. To identify genes limiting T cell effector function, we conducted genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens in human primary CAR-T cells. The top hits were MED12 and CCNC, components of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) module of the Mediator complex, an evolutionarily conserved regulator of gene transcription. MED12 or CCNC deficient CAR-T cells manifest increased expansion, cytokine production, metabolic fitness, effector function, anti-tumor activity and reduced terminal effector differentiation. Chemical inhibition of CDK8/19 kinase activity recapitulated some features of genetic loss of MED12, including increased T cell expansion. MED12 deficient CAR-T cells showed widespread but selective increases in chromatin accessibility, MED1 chromatin occupancy, and H3K27 acetylation at enhancers used by transcription factors playing a critical role in T cell fate, including several STAT and AP1 family members. The most pronounced enhancement was observed for STAT5 which manifested as increased sensitivity to IL-2 in MED12 deficient T cells. These results link Mediator induced transcriptional coactivation with T cell effector programming and identify the CDK module as a target for enhancing the potency of anti-tumor T cell responses.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe Mediator kinase module is a primary regulator of T cell differentiation, and genetic or small molecule-based inhibition of this module enhances effector T cell potency.",

    "abstract": "The gravitational biological pump is not large enough to account for microbial heterotrophic activity in the mesopelagic ocean. Migrating zooplankton may be a key source of organic matter transport to depth. Here we show signatures of zooplankton in the suspended organic matter at the zooplankton vertical migration depth in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific Oxygen Deficient Zone (ETNP ODZ). We examine the mesozooplankton community in metagenomic depth profiles using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase (COI) gene as a marker in the ETNP and Eastern Tropical South Pacific (ETSP) ODZs and at the oxic Hawaii Ocean Timeseries (HOT). Additionally, eukaryotic transcripts (polyA-selected) were examined for zooplankton in the ETNP. While zooplankton eDNA increased in the ODZ, zooplankton eRNA decreased in the ODZ, similar to previous net-based data, implying that eDNA is better preserved under anoxia. At all stations, Cnidaria, often missed in net-based data, contributed greatly to the zooplankton eDNA/eRNA. SAR11 abundance, determined from the single-copy core gene (rpoB), significantly correlated with zooplankton eDNA, with R2 values >0.8 at all stations. Strong correlations between SAR11 and zooplankton have not been previously reported, but are logical as SAR11 bacteria consume and zooplankton excrete simple dissolved organic compounds. SAR11 bacteria possessed genes to utilize urea and taurine in the ODZ, both compounds known to be excreted by zooplankton. In ODZs, SAR11 bacteria preferentially used the taurine degradation pathway leading to C and N assimilation, not the pathway for organic S assimilation, probably due to additional sources of organic S in ODZs.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are highly toxic DNA lesions that can induce mutations and chromosome rearrangement therefore causing genome instability (GIN). In response to DSBs, cells activate the DNA damage response by hierarchical assembly of signaling and repair mechanisms. This involves recruitment of the repair factors at DSB sites, local chromatin remodeling, cell cycle arrest and, eventually, DNA repair or apoptosis. Studies investigating mechanisms ensuring genome stability have so far mostly focused on DNA-protein interactions and signal transduction in response to DNA damage. Emerging evidence in the last decade suggests that post-transcriptional control of gene expression by RNA-binding proteins also participates in maintaining genome integrity. However, how specific control of RNA fate mechanistically affects genome stability is still poorly understood. Here, we report that the pseudokinase HPO-11 ensures genome integrity in C. elegans. Loss of hpo-11 leads to accumulation of R-loops, increased DSBs and germline apoptosis, as well as an elevated mutation rate in the somatic cells. In addition, inhibition of nonsense mediated decay (NMD) reduces DSBs and germline apoptosis in the absence of hpo-11. We find that HPO-11 physically interacts with SMG-2, the core factor of NMD, and prevents degradation of specific transcripts by NMD, thus contributing to maintenance of genome stability. Furthermore, knock-down of hpo-11 human homologs NRBP1/2 also results in increased DNA DSBs, and NRBP1/2 physically interact with the human SMG-2 orthologue UPF1. In summary, our work identifies an evolutionarily conserved role of HPO-11 to protect genome stability via suppressing abnormal mRNA decay by NMD.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria are common and efficient protein expression systems, yet their outer membrane endotoxins can elicit undesirable toxic effects, limiting their applicability for parenteral therapeutic applications, e.g., production of vaccine components. In the bacterial genus Sphingomonas from the Alphaproteobacteria class, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) endotoxins are replaced with non-toxic glycosphingolipids (GSL), rendering it an attractive alternative for therapeutic protein production. To explore the use of Sphingomonas as a safe expression system for production of proteins for therapeutic applications, in this study, Sphingobium japonicum (SJ) injected live into embryonated hen eggs proved safe and nontoxic. Multimeric viral polypeptides derived from Newcastle disease virus (NDV) designed for expression in SJ, yielded soluble proteins which were specifically recognized by antibodies raised against the whole virus. In addition, native signal peptides (SP) motifs identified using whole-genome computerized analysis and coupled to secreted proteins in SJ induced secretion of Amy and mCherry gene products. Relative to the same genes expressed without an SP, SP 104 increased secretion of Amy (3.7-fold) and mCherry (16.3-fold) proteins and yielded accumulation of up to 80{micro}g/L of the later in the culture medium. Taken together, the presented findings demonstrate the potential of this unique LPS-free Gram-negative bacterial family to serve as an important tool for protein expression for both research and biotechnological purposes, including for the development of novel vaccines.\n\nImportanceThe Gram-negative, LPS-free Sphingomonas genus can serve as an effective and safe platform for therapeutic protein expression and secretion and bears potential as a live bacteria delivery system for protein vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The innate host defence system is designed to resist pathogenic microorganism infections. Despite the compelling scientific evidence, our understanding of the full potential of the mechanism is still unclear due to the complex interactions between hosts and invaders. We previously reported latency in cat mucosal infected with low-dose cell-associated feline immunodeficiency virus (102 and 103 infected cells). Here we investigated the expression of Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic subunit 3G (APOBEC3G or A3G) in feline cells and tissues and whether its presence antagonizes the viral pre-integration complex resulting in partial or complete FIV latency. Total RNA and protein lysates were collected from cell lines, blood, and tissue samples. Real-time RT-PCR and western blot assays were used to quantify fA3G-like protein in cats exposed to high versus low-dose cell-associated FIV. We consistently detected fA3G-like protein in mock T-cell lines (E-CD4+, MYA-1, Crandell feline kidney cells) and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages with variable expressions in feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In addition, the fA3G-like protein was found to interact with FIV group-specific antigen (Gag) protein through immunoprecipitation assays. The protein expression was utterly abrogated following FIV infection. However, in lytic FIV infection (in vivo), fA3G-like protein decreased in early post-infection, whereas latently infected cats showed stable expression. These data are the first report of the fA3G-like protein expression in felines and its abrogation in lytic but not in latent FIV-infected individuals. These results might provide new insight into the role of fA3G-like protein in the host defence mechanism against retrovirus infections.",

    "abstract": "H3K9me3-based gene silencing is a conserved strategy for securing cell fate, but the mechanisms controlling lineage-specific installation of this epigenetic mark remain unclear. In Drosophila, H3K9 methylation plays an essential role in securing female germ cell fate by silencing lineage inappropriate phf7 transcription. Thus, phf7 regulation in the female germline provides a powerful system to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying H3K9me3 deposition onto protein coding genes. Here we used genetic studies to identify the essential cis-regulatory elements, finding that the sequences required for H3K9me3 deposition are conserved across Drosophila species. Transposable elements are also silenced by an H3K9me3-mediated mechanism. But our finding that phf7 regulation does not require the dedicated piRNA pathway components, piwi, aub, rhino, panx, and nxf2, indicates that the mechanisms of H3K9me3 recruitment are distinct. Lastly, we discovered that an uncharacterized member of the zinc finger associated domain (ZAD) containing C2H2 zinc finger protein family, IDENTITY CRISIS (IDC; CG4936), is necessary for H3K9me3 deposition onto phf7. Loss of idc in germ cells interferes with phf7 transcriptional regulation and H3K9me3 deposition, resulting in ectopic PHF7 protein expression. IDCs role is likely to be direct, as it localizes to a conserved domain within the phf7 gene. Collectively, our findings support a model in which IDC guides sequence-specific establishment of an H3K9me3 mini domain, thereby preventing accidental female-to-male programming.\n\nAuthor SummaryTissue development and function relies on cells remembering their identity. A cells identity is defined by the genes it expresses and those it does not. Recent work has shown that genes can be silenced by trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3) marked chromatin, and that H3K9me3-mediated gene silencing is a vital strategy for securing cell fate. But there is very little information about how the machinery responsible for H3K9 methylation finds its target genes. Here we explore this issue using the Drosophila female germline where a mini domain of repressive H3K9me3 chromatin secures female germ cell fate by silencing phf7, a gene normally expressed in male germ cells. Transposable elements are also silenced by H3K9me3 mini domains, but we find that the proteins involved in this process are not required for phf7 silencing. Instead, we find that silencing requires a previously uncharacterized protein, we have named IDENTITY CRISIS. Our work provides evidence that IDENTITY CRISIS directs the H3K9 methylation machinery to build a mini domain at the phf7 locus. Our results shed new light into how cells safeguard their identity by silencing cell type inappropriate genes, and more specifically how these genes are identified by the silencing machinery.",

    "abstract": "Interstitial telomere sequences (ITS) are degenerate telomere tracts scattered along chromosome arms whose functions are not well understood. We found that critically shortened telomeres of C. elegans telomerase mutants initiate DNA synthesis within ITS tracts that were close to or far from a telomere. Some ITS tracts were targeted recurrently. RTEL-1 dismantles T-loops and recombination intermediates, and DNA polymerase theta (POLQ-1) promotes end-joining using short segments of microhomology. In telomerase mutants, RTEL-1 and POLQ-1 promoted telomere fusion and DNA synthesis at subtelomeric ITS tracts. RTEL-1 is known to suppress homologous recombination, and we found that RTEL-1 similarly suppressed POLQ-1-mediated double-strand break repair. Mutation signatures characteristic of repair by POLQ-1 occurred during initiation of subtelomeric DNA synthesis and at subsequent template shifting events. We propose that RTEL-1 and POLQ-1 play distinct essential roles in subtelomeric DNA synthesis, a process that may contribute significantly to telomere fusion and tumor genome evolution.",

    "abstract": "Classical dynamins are best understood for their ability to generate vesicles by membrane fission. During clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), dynamin is recruited to the membrane through multivalent protein and lipid interactions between its Proline Rich Domain (PRD) with SRC Homology 3 (SH3) domains in endocytic proteins and its Pleckstrin Homology Domain (PHD) with membrane lipids. Variable loops (VL) in the PHD bind lipids and partially insert into the membrane thereby anchoring the PHD to the membrane. Recent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations reveal a novel VL4 that interacts with the membrane. Importantly, a missense mutation that reduces VL4 hydrophobicity is linked to an autosomal dominant form of Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) neuropathy. To mechanistically link data from simulations with the CMT neuropathy, we analyzed functions of a VL4 mutant with reduced hydrophobicity. In assays that rely solely on lipid-based membrane recruitment, this mutant showed an acute membrane curvature-dependent binding and fission. Remarkably, in assays that mimic a physiological multivalent lipid- and protein-based recruitment, this mutant was completely defective in fission across a range of membrane curvatures. Importantly, expression of this mutant in cells inhibited CME, consistent with the autosomal dominant phenotype associated with the CMT neuropathy. Together, our results emphasize the significance of finely tuned lipid and protein interactions for efficient dynamin function.",

    "abstract": "The development of cost-effective serum-free media is essential for the economic viability of cultured meat. A key challenge facing this goal is high-cost recombinant albumin that is necessary in some available serum-free media formulations. As such, there is substantial interest in finding albumin alternatives which are low-cost, effective, scalable, sustainable, and suitable for food applications. Recently, a serum-free medium termed Beefy-9 was developed for bovine satellite cells (BSCs), which relied on recombinant albumin as a key component to replace fetal bovine serum. Here we alter Beefy-9 by replacing albumin with rapeseed protein isolate, a bulk-protein solution obtained from agricultural waste-streams through simple isoelectric protein precipitation. This new medium, termed Beefy-R, improves BSC growth compared with Beefy-9 while maintaining cell phenotype and myogenicity. These results offer an effective, low-cost, and sustainable alternative to albumin for serum-free culture of muscle stem cells, thereby addressing a key hurdle facing cultured meat production.",

    "abstract": "Reliable prediction of free energy changes upon amino acidic substitutions ({Delta}{Delta}Gs) is crucial to investigate their impact on protein stability and protein-protein interaction. Moreover, advances in experimental mutational scans allow high-throughput studies thanks to sophisticated multiplex techniques. On the other hand, genomics initiatives provide a large amount of data on disease-related variants that can benefit from analyses with structure-based methods. Therefore, the computational field should keep the same pace and provide new tools for fast and accurate high-throughput calculations of {Delta}{Delta}Gs. In this context, the Rosetta modeling suite implements effective approaches to predict the change in the folding free energy in a protein monomer upon amino acid substitutions and calculate the changes in binding free energy in protein complexes. Their application can be challenging to users without extensive experience with Rosetta. Furthermore, Rosetta protocols for {Delta}{Delta}G prediction are designed considering one variant at a time, making the setup of high-throughput screenings cumbersome. For these reasons, we devised RosettaDDGPrediction, a customizable Python wrapper designed to run free energy calculations on a set of amino acid substitutions using Rosetta protocols with little intervention from the user. RosettaDDGPrediction assists with checking whether the runs are completed successfully aggregates raw data for multiple variants, and generates publication-ready graphics. We showed the potential of the tool in selected case studies, including variants of unknown significance found in children who developed cancer, proteins with known experimental unfolding {Delta}{Delta}Gs values, interactions between target proteins and a disordered functional motif, and phospho-mimetic variants.

    "abstract": "Complex cellular functions are usually encoded by a set of genes in one or a few organized genetic loci in microbial genomes. Macromolecular System Finder (MacSyFinder) is a program that uses these properties to model and then annotate cellular functions in microbial genomes. This is done by integrating the identification of each individual gene at the level of the molecular system. We hereby present a major release of MacSyFinder (version 2) coded in Python 3. The code was improved and rationalized to facilitate future maintainability. Several new features were added to allow more flexible modelling of the systems. We introduce a more intuitive and comprehensive search engine to identify all the best candidate systems and sub-optimal ones that respect the models constraints. We also introduce the novel macsydata companion tool that enables the easy installation and broad distribution of the models developed for MacSyFinder (macsy-models) from GitHub repositories. Finally, we have updated and improved MacSyFinder popular models: TXSScan to identify protein secretion systems, TFFscan to identify type IV filaments, CONJscan to identify conjugative systems, and CasFinder to identify CRISPR associated proteins.

    "abstract": "Micromechanical studies of mitotic chromosomes have revealed them to be remarkably extensible objects and informed early models of mitotic chromosome organization. We use a data-driven, coarsegrained polymer modeling approach, capable of generating ensembles of chromosome structures that are quantitatively consistent with experiments, to explore the relationship between the spatial organization of individual chromosomes and their emergent mechanical properties. In particular, we investigate the mechanical properties of our model chromosomes by axially stretching them. Simulated stretching led to a linear force-extension curve for small strain, with mitotic chromosomes behaving about ten-fold stiffer than interphase chromosomes. Studying the relaxation dynamics we found that chromosomes are viscoelastic solids, with a highly liquid-like, viscous behavior in interphase that becomes solid-like in mitosis. This emergent mechanical stiffness in our model originates from lengthwise compaction, an effective potential capturing the activity of loop-extruding SMC complexes. Chromosomes denature under large strains via unraveling, which is characterized by opening of large-scale folding patterns. By quantifying the effect of mechanical perturbations on the chromosomes structural features, our model provides a nuanced understanding of in vivo mechanics of chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "The protein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a master regulator of cell homeostasis. Although mTOR is aberrantly overactivated in 70% ovarian cancers, mTOR cascade inhibitors (such as those blocking the kinase activity of mTOR itself or upstream kinases PI3K/AKT) have demonstrated disappointing activity in ovarian cancer clinical trials. These findings indicate that, despite its pivotal role in normal cells, hyperactivated mTOR does not act as a master regulator of metabolism in this cancer context. Surprisingly, we have identified that the RNA binding protein LARP1, a known phospho-target of mTORC1 and activator of ribosomal biogenesis, is responsible for metabolic reprogramming in mTOR-dysregulated cancers. LARP1 post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of several hundred rate-limiting enzymes involved in multiple aspects of metabolism, including glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Through this mechanism LARP1 sustains ATP production and mTORC1 localisation on the lysosome, thereby activating cell proliferation despite the scarcity of extracellular nutrients. Our findings show that, by sustaining global cellular metabolism in response to growth factor signalling, LARP1 has a central post-transcriptional role in controlling mTORC1 localisation and driving cancer progression, a key cancer hallmark.",

    "abstract": "Since 2008, legislative initiatives for climate protection and reduced dependency on fossil resource imports led to the introduction of biofuels as CO2-reduced alternatives in the heating oil sector. In the case of biodiesel, the oil industry or its customers were confronted with accelerated and escalating microbial contaminations during heating oil storage. Since then, other fuel alternatives, like hydrogenated vegetable oils, gas-to-liquid products (GtL), or Oxymethylenether (OME) have been or will be developed and potentially introduced to the market. In this study, we use online monitoring of microbial CO2 production and the simulation of onset of microbial contamination to investigate the contamination potential of fuel alternatives during storage. As reference and blends, fossil heating oils of various refineries, in the course of this from various crude oils, and refinery processes reveal considerable variation in potential microbial activity. Oxymethylene ethers have an antimicrobial effect, while various forms of biodiesel confirm the promotion of microbial activity and diversity. The paraffinic Fischer-Tropsch products and biogenic hydrogenation products demonstrate high resistance to microbial contamination despite allowing microbial diversity. Through an array of analytics, including advanced chromatography coupled mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and microbial sequencing, we can discuss critical fuel properties that promote or inhibit microbial contaminations. In summary, novel, non-fossil heating oils show different strengths and weaknesses for long-term storage. Designing blends for microbial activity reduced long-term storage might be an option. While being niche products, these fuels will contribute to the rapid reduction of fossil resource use.",

The SOS response is a key bacterial pathway to repair DNA double strand breaks and may therefore be a good target for novel therapeutics to sensitise bacteria to antibiotics and the immune response. However, the genes required for the SOS response in Staphylococcus aureus have not been fully established. Therefore, we carried out a screen of mutants involved in various DNA repair pathways to understand which were required for induction of the SOS response. This led to the identification of 16 genes that may play a role in SOS response induction, and of these, 3 that affected susceptibility of S. aureus to ciprofloxacin. Further characterisation revealed that, in addition to ciprofloxacin, loss of the tyrosine recombinase XerC increased the susceptibility of S. aureus to various classes of antibiotics, as well as to host immune defences. Therefore, the inhibition of XerC may be a viable therapeutic approach to sensitise S. aureus to both antibiotics and the immune response.",

Given the huge diversity within and between lineages in this complex, the objective was to produce affordable genomic resources for population and evolutionary genomic studies to broaden the coverage of this diverse species complex. I used transcriptome guided corrections and scaffolding on a chromosome scale genome of a close species to reduce the fragmentation of the genomes.

We map out the DNA density within the network and the distribution of linking number and valence of the minicircles. We also characterise the DNA hubs that surround the network and show that they cause a buckling transition akin to that of a 2D elastic thermal sheet in the bulk. Intriguingly, we observe a broad distribution of density and valence of the minicircles, indicating heterogeneous network structure and individualism of different kDNA structures.

    "abstract": "The ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP7 modulates protein function by conjugating ADP-ribose to the side chains of acceptor amino acids. PARP7 has been shown to affect gene expression in prostate cancer cells and certain other cell types by mechanisms that include transcription factor ADP-ribosylation. Here, we use a recently developed catalytic inhibitor to PARP7, RBN2397, to study the effects of PARP7 inhibition in androgen receptor-positive and androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer cells. We find that RBN2397 has nanomolar potency for inhibiting androgen-induced ADP-ribosylation of the androgen receptor. RBN2397 inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cells in culture when cells are treated with ligands that activate the androgen receptor, or the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, and induce PARP7 expression. We show that the growth inhibitory effects of RBN2397 are distinct from its enhancement of interferon signaling recently shown to promote tumor immunogenicity. RBN2397 treatment also induces trapping of PARP7 in a detergentresistant fraction within the nucleus, which is reminiscent of how inhibitors such as Talazoparib affect PARP1 fractionation. Because PARP7 is expressed in AR negative metastatic tumors and RBN2397 can affect cancer cells through multiple mechanisms, PARP7 may be an actionable target in advanced prostate cancer.\n\nSignificanceRBN2397 is a potent and selective inhibitor of PARP7 that reduces the growth of prostate cancer cells, including a model for treatment-emergent neuroendocrine prostate cancer. RBN2397 induces PARP7 trapping on chromatin, suggesting its mechanism of action might be similar to clinically-used PARP1 inhibitors.",

Here we report that tumor endothelial cell dysfunction confers resistance to immunotherapy in preclinical GBM models. Anti-VEGF-therapy-induced vascular normalization is insufficient to fully restore the endothelial cell function. Strikingly, concomitant blockade of Ang2, VEGF, and PD1 reprograms dysfunctional endothelial cells to quasi-antigen presenting cells and upregulates receptors required for cytotoxic T lymphocyte entry into the tumor. Blocking VEGF, Ang2, and PD1 induces durable anti-tumor T cell responses. Upregulation of the transcription factor T-bet is both necessary and sufficient for generating resident memory T cells elicited by this combination therapy. In summary, our study reveals the role of Ang2 in resistance to PD1-blockade and provides a compelling rationale for clinical evaluation of blocking Ang2 along with VEGF and PD1 in GBM patients.\n\nStatement of SignificanceOur study is the first to demonstrate Ang2 as a resistance pathway for both VEGF and PD1 in GBM.

    "abstract": "B cell antigen receptor (BCR) signaling competence is critical for pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Defining key proteins that facilitate these networks aid in the identification of targets for therapeutic exploitation. We previously demonstrated that reduced PKC function in mouse hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HPSCs) resulted in PKC{beta}II upregulation and generation of a poor-prognostic CLL-like disease. Here, prkcb knockdown in HSPCs leads to reduced survival of PKC-KR-expressing CLL-like cells, concurrent with reduced expression of the leukemic markers CD5 and CD23. SP1 promotes elevated expression of prkcb in PKC-KR expressing cells enabling leukemogenesis. Global gene analysis revealed an upregulation of genes associated with B cell activation in PKC-KR expressing cells, coincident with upregulation of PKC{beta}II: supported by activation of key signaling hubs proximal to the BCR and elevated proliferation. Ibrutinib (BTK inhibitor) or enzastaurin (PKC{beta}II inhibitor) treatment of PKC-KR expressing cells and primary CLL cells showed similar patterns of Akt/mTOR pathway inhibition, supporting the role for PKC{beta}II in maintaining proliferative signals in our CLL mouse model. Ibrutinib or enzastaurin treatment also reduced PKC-KR-CLL cell migration towards CXCL12. Overall, we demonstrate that PKC{beta} expression facilitates leukemogenesis and identify that BCR-mediated signaling is a key driver of CLL development in the PKC-KR model.\n\nStatement of SignificancePKC{beta} facilitates leukemogenesis of CLL, driven through an SP1-regulated transcriptional program and promotes BCR signaling. Thus far, PKC{beta} is the only kinase within the BCR signaling pathway, a key pathway in driving CLL pathogenesis, implicated in the generation of neoplastic B lineage cells.",

Using static kill curve experiments, observing two evolution cycles, it was demonstrated that rifampicin resistance was the result of non-specific mechanisms and not associated with accumulation of drug resistance encoding SNPs. Whereas, part of isoniazid resistance could be accounted for by accumulation of specific SNPs, which was concentration dependent. Using a Hollow Fibre Infection Model it was demonstrated that emergence of genotypic resistance only occurs when antibiotic levels fall below MIC although MICs are typically maintained following clinical dosing provided that adherence to the regimen is good. This study showed that disentangling and quantifying concentration dependent emergence of resistance provides improved rational for drug and dose selection although further work on understanding underlying mechanisms is needed to improve the drug development pipeline.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDisentangling and quantifying concentration dependent emergence of resistance will contribute to better informed drug and dose selection for anti-mycobacterial combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Sensory perception relies on the flexible detection and interpretation of stimuli across variable contexts, conditions, and behavioral states. The basal forebrain is a hub for behavioral state regulation, supplying dense cholinergic and GABAergic projections to various brain regions involved in sensory processing. Of GABAergic neurons in the basal forebrain, parvalbumin (PV) and somatostatin (SST) subtypes serve opposing roles regulating behavioral states. To elucidate the role of basal forebrain circuits in sensory-guided behavior, we investigated GABAergic signaling dynamics during odor-guided decision-making. We used fiber photometry to record cell type-specific basal forebrain activity during an odor discrimination task and correlate temporal patterns of PV and SST neuronal activity with olfactory task performance. We found that PV-expressing GABAergic neurons are activated by odors and are selectively suppressed by reward. However, SST-expressing GABAergic neurons are activated during both odor and reward delivery. Notably, odor and reward responses of PV and SST neurons are uniquely correlated with behavioral measures of odor discrimination and decision bias. Additionally, as mice undergo discrimination learning, the magnitude of reward-related excitation decreases in SST neurons, while reward-related suppression increases in PV neurons. Finally, we show that chemogenetic inhibition of SST neurons alters decision bias to favor reward-seeking. These results suggest that subtypes of GABAergic basal forebrain neurons are differentially involved in decision-making, and that their bidirectional activity impacts decision making during olfactory guided behavior.",

    "abstract": "The thyroid functions at the apex of a web of endocrine organs that control cell growth, differentiation and metabolic homeostasis. Thyroid dysregulation significantly impacts human health in myriad ways with thyroid diseases standing as the most common endocrine disorder. Despite the essential role of the thyroid in human health, a high-resolution view of the cellular composition as well as molecular mechanisms that govern function of this crucial organ have been lacking. Employing the first single-cell analyses of adult mouse thyroid, we here report the discovery of unexpected thyrocyte heterogeneity, specifically three distinct thyrocyte subtypes marked by different metabolic and Notch signaling patterns. Using a battery of pharmacologic and genetic methods, we find that selective inhibition of Notch ligands and receptors disrupts thyrocyte mitochondrial activity and ROS production, thus decreasing levels of circulating thyroid hormones, inducing hypothyroidism and disrupting whole-body thermoregulation. We find an enriched frequency of hypothyroidism in children with Alagille Syndrome, a genetic disorder marked by Notch loss-of-function mutations, suggesting that our Notch-thyroid mechanisms are relevant in humans and directly account for Alagille hypothyroidism. Overall, our work reveals that Notch, although classically described as a developmental pathway that determines cell fate, controls homeostasis and thermoregulation in the adult through a mitochondria-based mechanism in a subset of thyrocytes. Our fine-grained picture of the thyroid unveils a novel understanding of this key metabolic organ and provides clinically impactful insights into its pathological dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "Adult stem cells undergo asymmetric cell divisions to produce two daughter cells with distinct cell fates: one capable of self-renewal and the other committed for differentiation. Mis-regulation of this delicate balance can lead to cancer and tissue degeneration. During asymmetric division of Drosophila male germline stem cells (GSCs), preexisting (old) and newly synthesized histone H3 are differentially segregated whereas old and new histone variant H3.3 are more equally inherited. However, what underlies these distinct inheritance patterns remains unknown. Here, we report that the N-terminal tails of H3 and H3.3 are critical for their inheritance patterns, as well as GSC maintenance and proper differentiation. H3 and H3.3 differ at the 31st position in their N-termini with Alanine for H3 and Serine for H3.3. By swapping these two amino acids, we generated two mutant histones (i.e., H3A31S and H3.3S31A). Upon expressing them in the early-stage germline, we identified opposing phenotypes: over-population of early-stage germ cells in the H3A31S-expressing testes and significant germ cell loss in testes expressing the H3.3S31A. Asymmetric H3 inheritance is disrupted in the H3A31S-expressing GSCs, due to mis-incorporation of old histones between sister chromatids during DNA replication. Furthermore, H3.3S31A mutation accelerates old histone turn-over in the GSCs. Finally, using a modified Chromatin Immunocleavage assay on early-stage germ cells, we found that H3A31S has an enhanced occupancy at the promoters and transcription starting sites than H3, while H3.3S31A is more enriched at transcriptionally silent intergenic regions compared to H3.3. Overall, these results suggest that the 31st amino acids for both H3 and H3.3 are critical for their proper genomic occupancy and function. Together, our findings indicate a critical role for the different amino acid composition of the N-terminal tails between H3 and H3.3 in an endogenous stem cell lineage, and provide insights into the importance of proper histone inheritance in specifying cell fates and regulating cellular differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s) from in vitro studies has been complemented by genome-wide G4 landscapes from cultured cells. Conventionally, the formation of G4s is accepted to depend on G-repeats such that they form tetrads. However, genome-wide G4s characterized through high-throughput sequencing suggest that these structures form at a large number of regions with no such canonical G4-forming signatures. Many G4-binding proteins have been described with no evidence for any protein that binds to and stabilizes G4s. It remains unknown what fraction of G4s formed in human cells are protein-bound. The G4-chromatin immunoprecipitation (G4-ChIP) method hitherto employed to describe G4 landscapes preferentially reports G4s that get crosslinked to proteins in their proximity. Our current understanding of the G4 landscape is biased against representation of G4s which escape crosslinking as they are not stabilized by protein-binding and presumably transient. We report a protocol that captures G4s from the cells efficiently without any bias as well as eliminates the detection of G4s formed artifactually on crosslinked sheared chromatin post-fixation. We discover that G4s form sparingly at SINEs. An application of this method shows that depletion of a repeat-binding protein CGGBP1 enhances net G4 capture at CGGBP1-dependent CTCF-binding sites and regions of sharp interstrand G/C-skew transitions. Thus, we present an improved method for G4 landscape determination and by applying it we show that sequence property-specific constraints of the nuclear environment mitigate G4 formation.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) is crucial for hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) generation. During EHT, the morphology of hemogenic endothelial cells (HECs) changes from flat and adherent to spherical HSCs, which detach from the dorsal aorta. HECs attain a rounded shape in a mitosis-independent manner before cell adhesion termination, suggesting an atypical cell-rounding mechanism. However, the direct mechanisms underlying this change in cell morphology during EHT remain unclear. Here, we show that large vacuoles were transiently formed in HECs and that aquaporin-1 (AQP1) was localized in the vacuole and plasma membranes. Overexpression of AQP1 in non-HECs induced ectopic vacuole expansion, cell rounding, and subsequent cell detachment from the endothelium into the bloodstream, mimicking EHT. Loss of redundant AQP functions by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing in HECs impeded the morphological EHT. Our findings provide the first evidence indicating that morphological segregation of HSCs from endothelial cells is regulated by water influx into vacuoles. These findings provide important insights for further exploration of the mechanisms underlying cell/tissue morphogenesis through water-adoptive cellular responses.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTHemogenic endothelial cells transiently form large vacuoles during endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition. Aquaporin water channels regulate cell rounding and detachment of emerging hematopoietic stem cells through vacuole formation.",

    "abstract": "The neural mechanisms underlying the exogenous coding and neural entrainment to rapid auditory stimuli have seen a recent surge of interest. However, few studies have characterized how parametric changes in stimulus presentation alter entrained responses. Applying inter-trial phase-locking (ITPL) and phase-locking value (PLV) analyses applied to high-density human electroencephalogram (EEG) data, we investigated the degree to which the brain entrains to speech vs. non-speech (i.e., click) sounds within and across tokens. Passive cortico-acoustic tracking was investigated in N=24 normal young adults utilizing EEG time-frequency and source analyses that isolated neural activity stemming from both auditory temporal cortices. We parametrically manipulated the rate and periodicity of repetitive, continuous speech and click stimuli to investigate how speed and jitter in ongoing sounds stream affect oscillatory entrainment. Both stimulus domains showed rightward hemisphere asymmetry in phase-locking strength with stronger and earlier responses to speech vs. clicks. Neuronal synchronization to speech was enhanced at 4.5 Hz (the putative universal rate of speech) and showed a differential pattern to that of clicks, particularly at higher rates. Phase-locking to speech decreased with increasing jitter but entrainment to speech remained superior to clicks. Surprisingly, click were invariant to periodicity manipulations. Our findings provide evidence that the brains neural entrainment to complex sounds is enhanced and more sensitized when processing speech relative to non-speech sounds. That this specialization is apparent even under passive listening suggests a priority of the auditory system for synchronizing to behaviorally-relevant signals.",

    "abstract": "Alpha is the strongest electrophysiological rhythm in awake humans at rest. Despite its predominance in the EEG signal, strong variations can be observed in alpha properties during development, with an increase of alpha frequency over childhood and adulthood. Here we tested the hypothesis that these changes of alpha rhythm are related to the maturation of visual white matter pathways. We capitalized on a large dMRI-EEG dataset (dMRI n=2,747, EEG n=2,561) of children and adolescents (age range: 5-21 years old) and showed that maturation of the optic radiation specifically accounts for developmental changes of alpha frequency. Behavioral analyses also confirmed that variations of alpha frequency are related to maturational changes in visual perception. The present findings demonstrate the close link between developmental variations in white matter tissue properties, electrophysiological responses, and behavior.",
