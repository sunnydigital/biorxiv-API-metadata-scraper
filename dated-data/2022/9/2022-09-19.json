    "abstract": "Prion strains in a given type of mammalian host are distinguished by differences in clinical presentation, neuropathological lesions, survival time, and characteristics of the infecting prion protein (PrP) assemblies. Near-atomic structures of prions from two host species with different PrP sequences have been determined but comparisons of distinct prion strains of the same amino acid sequence are needed to identify purely conformational determinants of prion strain characteristics. Here we report a 3.2 [A] resolution cryogenic electron microscopy-based structure of the 22L prion strain purified from the brains of mice engineered to express only PrP lacking glycophosphatidylinositol anchors (a22L). Comparison of this near-atomic structure to our recently determined structure of the aRML strain propagated in the same inbred mouse reveals that these two mouse prion strains have distinct conformational templates for growth via incorporation of PrP molecules of the same sequence. Both a22L and aRML are assembled as stacks of PrP molecules forming parallel in-register intermolecular {beta}-sheets and intervening loops, with single monomers spanning the ordered fibril core. Each monomer shares an N-terminal steric zipper, three major {beta}-arches, and an overall V-shape, but the details of these and other conformational features differ markedly. Thus, variations in shared conformational motifs within a parallel in-register {beta}-stack fibril architecture provide a structural basis for prion strain differentiation within a single host genotype.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) represents a major unmet medical need owing to its diverse pathophysiology and lack of effective therapies. Potent synthetic, agonists (MR-356 and MR409) of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) improve the phenotype of models of HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and in cardiorenal models of HFpEF. Endogenous GHRH exhibits a broad range of regulatory influences in the cardiovascular (CV) system, aging and plays a role in several cardiometabolic conditions including obesity and diabetes. Whether agonists of GHRH can improve the phenotype of cardiometabolic HFpEF remains untested and unknown. Here we tested the hypothesis that MR-356 can mitigate/reverse the cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype. C57BL6N mice received a high fat diet (HFD) plus the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME) for 9 weeks. After 5 weeks of HFD+L-NAME regimen, animals were randomized to receive daily injections of MR-356 or placebo during a 4-week period. Control animals received no HFD+L-NAME or agonist treatment. Our results showed the unique potential of MR-356 to treat several HFpEF-like features including cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, capillary rarefaction, and pulmonary congestion. MR-356 improved cardiac performance by improving diastolic function, global longitudinal strain (GLS), and exercise capacity. Importantly, the increased expression of cardiac pro-brain natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) was restored to normal levels suggesting that MR-356 reduced myocardial stress associated with metabolic inflammation in HFpEF. Thus, agonists of GHRH may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cardiometabolic HFpEF phenotype.",

Given their different capabilities, it would be advantageous to build systems where both network types can synergistically interact. As proof-of-principle, we show how to create such a hybrid system and harness it to improve animal performance on biologically relevant tasks. Using optogenetics, we interfaced the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans with a deep reinforcement learning agent, enabling the animal to navigate to targets and enhancing its food search ability. Agents adapted to strikingly different sites of neural integration and learned site-specific activations to improve performance on a target-finding task. The animal plus agent displayed cooperative computation and generalized to novel environments. This work constitutes a demonstration of how to improve task performance in animals using artificial intelligence interfaced with a nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are a family of diseases that remain poorly treated despite their growing global health burden. A shared feature of many neurodegenerative disorders is the accumulation of toxic misfolded proteins. To gain insight into the mechanisms and modulators of protein misfolding, we developed a multiplex reverse genetics platform. Using this novel platform 29 cell-based models expressing proteins that undergo misfolding in neurodegeneration were probed against more than a thousand genetic modifiers. The resulting data provide insight into the nature of modifiers that act on multiple misfolded proteins as compared to those that show activity on only one. To illustrate the utility of this platform, we extensively characterized a potent hit from our screens, the human chaperone DNAJB6. We show that DNAJB6 is a general modifier of the toxicity and solubility of multiple amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (ALS/FTD)-linked RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), including FUS, TDP-43, and hnRNPA1. Biophysical examination of DNAJB6 demonstrated that it co-phase separates with, and alters the behavior of FUS containing condensates by locking them into a loose gel-like state which prevents their fibrilization. Domain mapping and a deep mutational scan of DNAJB6 support the critical importance for DNAJB6 phase separation in its effects on multiple RNA-binding proteins. Crucially, these studies also suggest that this property can be further tuned to generate novel variants with enhanced activity that might illuminate potential avenues for clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety, a state related to anticipatory fear, can be adaptive in the face of environmental threats or stressors. However, anxiety can also become persistent and manifest as anxiety-and stress-related disorders, such as generalized anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In rodents, systemic administration of glucocorticoids (GCs) or short-term restraint stress induces anxiety-like behaviors and dendritic branching within the basolateral complex of the amygdala (BLA) ten days later. Additionally, increased arousal-related memory retention mediated by elevated GCs requires concomitant noradrenaline (NE) signaling, both acting in the BLA. It is unknown whether GCs and NE play a role in the delayed acute stress-induced effects on behavior and BLA dendritic plasticity. Here, inhibiting corticosterone (CORT) elevation during two hours of restraint stress prevents stress-induced increases in delayed anxiety-like behavior and BLA dendritic spine density in rats. Also, we show that the delayed acute stress-induced effects on behavior and morphological alterations are critically dependent on genomic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) actions in the BLA. Unlike CORT, the pharmacological enhancement of NE signaling in the BLA was insufficient to drive delayed anxiety-related behavior. Nonetheless, the delayed anxiety-like behavior ten days after acute stress requires NE signaling in the BLA during stress exposure. Therefore, we define the essential roles of two stress-related hormones for the late stress consequences, acting at two separate times: CORT, via GR, immediately during stress and NE, via beta-adrenoceptors, during the expression of delayed anxiety.\n\nSignificance StatementThe dysregulation in orchestrating and finetuning major stress-related neural circuitries leads to enhanced reactivity and other altered ways of coping with threatening situations, predisposing humans to multiple psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and PTSD. Given the tremendous burden of affective disorders, we must advance our understanding of stress neurobiology and translate this into improved treatments. Here we showed that the absence of neuronal genomic GR signaling in the BLA prevented delayed effects on anxiety-like behavior and dendritic spine density ten days after stressor exposure. We also demonstrate that CORT, via GR and immediately at stress and NE, via beta-adrenoceptors, during the expression of delayed behavior contribute to the late stress consequences.",

    "abstract": "The heterogeneity of immune responses observed in humans is difficult to model in standard inbred laboratory mice. To capture the diversity inherent in mice and better understand how host variation affects BCG-induced immunity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 24 unique Collaborative Cross (CC) recombinant inbred mouse strains and the C57BL/6 reference strain were vaccinated with or without BCG, and then challenged with low-dose aerosolized virulent M. tuberculosis. In contrast to standard lab strains, BCG protected only half of the CC strains tested. Furthermore, BCG efficacy is dissociable from inherent susceptibility to TB. As these strains differed primarily in the genes and alleles they inherited from the CC founder strains, we conclude that the host genetic background has a major influence on whether BCG confers protection against M. tuberculosis infection and indicates that host genetics should be considered as an important barrier to vaccine-mediated protection. Importantly, we wished to identify the components of the immune response stimulated by BCG, which were subsequently recalled after Mtb infection and associated with protection. The T cell immune response following BCG vaccination and Mtb challenge was extensively characterized. Although considerable diversity was observed, BCG vaccination had little impact on the composition of T cells recruited and maintained in the lung after infection. Instead, the variability was largely shaped by the genetic background. We developed models to detect vaccine-induced differences, which identified immune signatures associated with BCG-elicited protection against TB. Importantly, even when categorized as susceptible vs. resistant, and protected vs. unprotected, many of the protected CC strains had unique flavors of immunity, indicating multiple paths to protection. Thus, CC mice can be used to define correlates of protection and to identify vaccine strategies that protect a larger fraction of genetically diverse individuals instead of optimizing protection for a single genotype.",

    "abstract": "CD4+ T cells are key components of the immune response during lung infections and can mediate protection against tuberculosis (TB) or influenza. However, CD4+ T cells can also promote lung pathology during these infections, making it unclear how these cells control such discrepant effects. Using mouse models of hypervirulent TB and influenza, we observed that exaggerated accumulation of parenchymal CD4+ T cells promotes lung damage. Low numbers of lung CD4+ T cells, in contrast, are sufficient to protect against hypervirulent TB. In both situations, lung CD4+ T cell accumulation is mediated by CD4+ T cell-specific expression of the extracellular ATP (eATP) receptor P2RX7. P2RX7 upregulation in lung CD4+ T cells promotes expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR3 and favors in situ proliferation. Our findings suggest that direct sensing of lung eATP by CD4+ T cells is critical to induce tissue CD4+ T cell accumulation and pathology during lung infections.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=168 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/508603v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a4cdaborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba95e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c60984org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ac0af_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "We conducted research to understand online trade in jaguar parts and develop tools of utility for jaguars and other species. Our research took place to identify potential trade across 31 online platforms in Spanish, Portuguese, English, Dutch, French, Chinese, and Vietnamese. We identified 230 posts from between 2009 and 2019. We screened the images of animal parts shown in search results to verify if from jaguar; 71 posts on 12 different platforms in four languages were accompanied by images identified as definitely jaguar, including a total of 125 jaguar parts (50.7% posts in Spanish, 25.4% Portuguese, 22.5% Chinese and 1.4% French). Search effort varied among languages due to staff availability. Standardizing for effort across languages by dividing number of posts advertising jaguars by search time and number individual searches completed via term/platform combinations, the adjusted rankings of posts were: Portuguese #1, Chinese 2 (time) & 3 (searches), Spanish 3 & 4; French 5 & 4; English 5 & 2, and Dutch 6. Teeth were most common; 156 posts offered at least 367 apparent teeth. From these, 95 teeth were assessed as definitely jaguar; 71 jaguar teeth could be linked to a location, with the majority of the 71 offered for sale from Mexico, China, Bolivia, and Brazil (26.8, 25.4, 16.9, and 12.7% respectively). Ranking of number of teeth was Mexico (19), China (18), Bolivia (12), Brazil (9), Peru/Ecuador (most accurate probable location) (8), Venezuela (3), Guadeloupe (1), and Uruguay (1). The second most traded item, skins and derivative items were only identified from Latin America: Brazil (7), was followed by Peru (6), Bolivia (3), Mexico (2 and 1 skin piece), and Nicaragua and Venezuela (1 each). Whether by number of posts or pieces, the ranking of parts was teeth, skins/pieces of skins, heads, and bodies. Our research presents a snapshot of online jaguar trade and methods that may have utility for many species now traded online. Our research took place within a longer-term project to assist law enforcement in host countries to better identify potential illegal trade online, with research findings informing hubs in Latin America for building such capacity.",

    "abstract": "All mitochondrial-encoded proteins and RNAs function through interactions with nuclear-encoded proteins. These interactions are critical for mitochondrial function and eukaryotic fitness, and coevolution maintains inter-genomic (i.e., mitonuclear) compatibility within taxa. Hybridization can disrupt coevolved interactions, resulting in hybrid breakdown, and mitonuclear incompatibilities may be important mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation and, potentially, speciation. Recently, signatures of strong selection to maintain compatible mitonuclear genotypes in hybrids have been detected in at least some inter-population crosses. However, this work has only been conducted in crosses between populations with extremely high levels of genetic divergence in both their mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, leaving the generality of strong selection for mitonuclear compatibility unclear. Here we address this limitation with reciprocal inter-population F2 hybrids between relatively low-divergence populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. Our results show that the dominance of mitonuclear effects consistent with coevolved mitonuclear genotypes in fast-developing (i.e., high-fitness) hybrids is reduced in low-divergence crosses, but that selection to maintain mitonuclear compatibility is still observed on some nuclear chromosomes. Consequently, we demonstrate that, even at low levels of genetic divergence between taxa, mitonuclear incompatibilities may play a key role in the early stages of reproductive isolation.",

Chromatin features in endocrine cells of the pancreatic islet are particularly informative and recent studies leveraging chromosome conformation capture (3C) with Hi-C based methods have elucidated regulatory mechanisms in human islets. However, these genome-wide approaches are less sensitive and afford lower resolution than methods that target specific loci. To gauge the extent to which targeted 3C further resolves chromatin-mediated regulatory mechanisms at GWAS loci, we generated interaction profiles at 23 loci using next-generation (NG) Capture-C in a human beta cell model (EndoC-{beta}H1) and contrasted these maps with Hi-C maps in EndoC-{beta}H1 cells and human islets and a promoter capture Hi-C map in human islets. We found improvements in assay sensitivity of up to 33-fold and resolved 4.8X more chromatin interactions. At a subset of 18 loci with 25 co-localised GWAS and eQTL signals, NG Capture-C interactions implicated effector transcripts at five additional genetic signals relative to promoter capture Hi-C through physical contact with gene promoters. Therefore, high resolution chromatin interaction profiles at selectively targeted loci can complement genome- and promoter-wide maps.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (CET) combined with sub-volume averaging (SVA), is currently the only imaging technique capable of determining the structure of proteins imaged inside cells at molecular resolution. To obtain high-resolution reconstructions, sub-volumes containing randomly distributed copies of the protein of interest need be identified, extracted and subjected to SVA, making accurate particle detection a critical step in the CET processing pipeline. Classical template-based methods have high false-positive rates due to the very low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) typical of CET volumes, while more recent neural-network based detection algorithms require extensive labeling, are very slow to train and can take days to run. To address these issues, we propose a novel particle detection framework that uses positive-unlabeled learning and exploits the unique properties of 3D tomograms to improve detection performance. Our end-to-end framework is able to identify particles within minutes when trained using a single partially labeled tomogram. We conducted extensive validation experiments on two challenging CET datasets representing different experimental conditions, and observed more than 10% improvement in mAP and F1 scores compared to existing particle picking methods used in CET. Ultimately, the proposed framework will facilitate the structural analysis of challenging biomedical targets imaged within the native environment of cells.",

Tumor metastasis into bone also alters biophysical cues to both tumour and bone cells, which are highly sensitive to their mechanical environment.

Here, we develop highly novel in vitro and computational models to provide an advanced understanding of how tumor growth is regulated by the synergistic influence of tumour-bone cell signaling and mechanobiological cues. In particular, we develop the first multicellular healthy and metastatic bone models, which can account for physiological mechanical signals within a custom bioreactor. These models successfully recapitulated mineralization, mechanobiological responses, osteolysis and metastatic activity. Ultimately we demonstrate that mechanical stimulus provided protective effects against tumor-induced osteolysis, confirming the importance of mechanobiological factors in bone metastasis development.",

    "abstract": "Animals are able to detect the nutritional content of sugar independently of taste. When given a choice between nutritive sugar and nonnutritive sugar, animals develop a preference for nutritive sugar over nonnutritive sugar during a period of food deprivation1-5. To quantify behavioral features during an episode of licking nutritive versus nonnutritive sugar, we implemented a multi-vision, deep learning-based 3D pose estimation system, termed the AI Vision Analysis for Three-dimensional Action in Real-Time (AVATAR)6. Using this method, we found that mice exhibit significantly different approach behavioral responses toward nutritive sugar versus nonnutritive sugar even before licking a sugar solution. Notably, the behavioral sequences during approach toward nutritive versus nonnutritive sugar became significantly different over time. These results suggest that the nutritional value of sugar not only promotes its consumption, but also elicits distinct repertoires of feeding behavior in deprived mice.",
