    "abstract": "High mutation and replication rates of HIV-1 result in the continuous generation of variants, allowing it to adapt to changing host environments. Mutations often have deleterious effects, but variants carrying them are rapidly purged. Surprisingly, a particular variant incapable of entering host cells was found to be rescued by host antibodies targeting HIV-1. Understanding the molecular mechanism of this rescue is important to develop and improve antibody-based therapies. To unravel the underlying mechanisms, we performed fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of the HIV-1 gp41 trimer responsible for viral entry into host cells, its entry-deficient variant, and its complex with the rescuing antibody. We find that the Q563R mutation, which the entry-deficient variant carries, prevents the native conformation of the gp41 6-helix bundle required for entry and stabilizes an alternative conformation instead. This is the consequence of substantial changes in the secondary structure and interactions between the domains of gp41. Binding of the antibody F240 to gp41 reverses these changes and re-establishes the native conformation, resulting in rescue. To test the generality of this mechanism, we performed simulations with the entry-deficient L565A variant and antibody 3D6. We find that 3D6 binding was able to reverse structural and interaction changes introduced by the mutation and restore the native gp41 conformation. Viral variants may not only escape antibodies but be aided by them in their survival, potentially compromising antibody-based therapies, including vaccination and passive immunization. Our simulation framework could serve as a tool to assess the likelihood of such resistance against specific antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Mtb) inflicts a quarter of the worldwide population. Most drugs for treating tuberculosis target cell growth and division. With rising drug resistance, it becomes ever more urgent to better understand Mtb cell division. This process begins with the formation of the Z-ring via polymerization of FtsZ and anchoring of the Z-ring to the inner membrane. Here, by combining solution and solid-state NMR spectroscopy with molecular dynamics simulations and other techniques, we show that the transmembrane protein FtsQ is a membrane anchor of the Mtb Z-ring. In the otherwise disordered N-terminal cytoplasmic region of FtsQ (residues 1-99), a 29-residue, Arg/Ala-rich -helix is formed that interacts with upstream acidic residues in solution and with acidic lipids at the membrane surface. The same helix also binds to the GTPase domain of FtsZ, with enormous implications for drug binding and Z-ring formation including its curvature.",

    "abstract": "Lamins are emerging as major regulators in the maintenance of nuclear architecture and genome organization. Extensive research for the last two decades has enormously contributed to understanding the roles of lamins in various signaling mechanisms which are drastically modified in neoplasia. It is interesting to record that alteration in lamin A/C expression and distribution drives tumorigenesis of almost all tissues of human bodies. One of the important signatures of a cancer cell is its inability to repair DNA damage which befalls several genomic events that transform the cells to be sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents. This genomic and chromosomal instability is the most common feature found in cases of high-grade ovarian serous carcinoma. Here, we report elevated levels of lamins in OVCAR3 cells (High grade ovarian serous carcinoma cell line) in comparison to IOSE (Immortalised ovarian surface epithelial cells) and consequently altered damage repair machinery in OVCAR3. We have analyzed the changes in global gene expression as a sequel to DNA damage induced by etoposide in ovarian carcinoma where lamin A is particularly elevated in expression and reported some differentially expressed genes associated with pathways conferring cellular proliferation and chemoresistance. We highlight new avenues unraveling the role of upregulated lamin A in confronting chemically induced genomic instability in the context of high grade ovarian serous cancer through a combination of HR and NHEJ mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Active learning, including student thinking and discussion in class, has been shown to increase student learning gains. However, it is less clear how variations in how instructors implement active learning affect student gains. Our study aims to investigate the extent to which the time spent on individual active learning activities influences student performance. We hypothesized that instructors who let students spend more time on individual thinking and peer discussion on practice problems associated with particular learning objectives will have better student exam scores on exam questions addressing those objectives. To test this hypothesis, we obtained a large data set of classroom recordings and student exam scores from an introductory biology course at a large four-year university, where three instructors shared identical teaching materials and exams for different course offerings.\n\nContrary to our hypothesis, although the three instructors spent significantly different amounts of time on episodes of thinking and peer discussion, there was no correlation between the total time spent on active learning activities and student performance on exam questions. Linear mixed-effects modeling of the effect of length of episodes of student thinking and discussion on exam score found that the amount of course time spent on active learning activities did not reliably predict student performance on associated exam questions. This result held true even when only considering learning objectives with high variations in performance between offerings, difficult exam questions, or within-instructor performance. Although our study was only conducted in one course, our results imply that time spent per individual episode of student thinking or peer discussion may not be the primary factor explaining the positive effects of active learning and that it may be worthwhile to explore other factors.",

However, how sensory cortical circuit mechanisms contribute to discrimination between subsecond temporal components in sensory events is unclear. To elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings of timing in primary visual cortex (V1), we recorded from V1 using 2-photon calcium imaging in awake-behaving mice performing a go/no-go discrimination timing task, which was composed of patterns of subsecond audio-visual stimuli. In both conditions, activity during the early stimulus period was temporally coordinated with the preferred stimulus. However, while network activity increased in the preferred condition, network activity was increasingly suppressed in the nonpreferred condition over the stimulus period. Our results demonstrate that discrimination between subsecond intervals that are contained in rhythmic patterns can be accomplished by local networks and suggest the contribution of neural resonance as a mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Although the botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are among the most toxic compounds found in nature, their molecular mechanism of action is far from being elucidated. A key event is the conformational transition due to the acidification of the interior of synaptic vesicles, and leading to the translocation of the BoNT catalytic domain into the neuronal cytosol. To investigate these conformational variations, homology modelling and atomistic simulations are combined to explore the internal dynamics of the subtypes BoNT/A1, the most-used in medical applications, and BoNT/E1, the most kinetically efficient. This first simulation study of di-chain BoNTs in closed and open states includes the effects of neutral and acidic pH. The conformational mobility is driven by domains displacements; the ganglioside binding site in the receptor binding domain, the translocation domain (HCNT) switch and the belt  helix visit multiple conformations depending on the primary sequence and on the pH. Fluctuations of the belt  helix are observed for closed conformations of the toxins and at acidic pH, and patches of more accessible residues appear in the same conditions in the core translocation domain HCNT. These findings suggest that during translocation, the larger mobility of belt could be transmitted to HCNT, leading to a favorable interaction of HCNT residues with the non-polar membrane environment.\n\nKey ContributionThe molecular dynamics simulations presented here provide a structural and functional annotation of full-length BoNTs composed by two distinct protein chains. Two different conformations (open and closed) as well as two different protonation states, corresponding to acidic and neutral pH, have been considered. Results from the present work supports a model of mobility in which the individual domains fluctuate around stable conformations and the overall structure mobility arise from relative displacements of the domains.",

    "abstract": "Adenovirus is a frequent cause of mild, usually self-limited infections in infants and young children. Severe infections occur in immunocompromised patients but are rarely observed in healthy, immunocompetent adults. However, there have been outbreaks around the world of infections with different adenoviral (Ad) serotypes that have resulted in acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in some of those infected. Ad14p1, the predominant circulating strain of Ad14 worldwide is one such serotype. The explanations for the severity of illness caused by Ad14p1 infection in immunocompetent patients is unknown. Previously, we have shown that A549 cells infected with Ad14 repress macrophage pro29 inflammatory responses whereas cells infected with Ad14p1 fail to repress macrophages and, instead, can increase pro-inflammatory responses. Micro-RNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Adenoviral infection has been shown to modulate host miRNA expression, and we hypothesized that differences in miRNA expression between Ad14 and Ad14p1 infected cells might impact pathogenesis. A549 cells were infected with either Ad14 or Ad14p1 and total RNA samples were collected at 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 post infection for miRNA sequencing. Cluster analysis revealed that there were 3 temporal changes in miRNA expression profiles following infection. Differential expression analysis showed 8-23 differentially expressed miRNA between Ad14 and Ad14p1 from 6 to 36hpi. However, at 48hpi there were 98 differentially expressed miRNAs in Ad14p1 infected cells compared to those infected by Ad14. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the differentially expressed miRNA might explain the increased pathogenesis of Ad14p1caused by strain-related loss of modulation of cytokine expression. Overall, the data suggest a role for viral regulation of host miRNA expression in pathogenesis by regulating host inflammatory responses through the delivery of deregulated miRNAs by virally infected cell corpses to macrophages.\n\nAuthor SummaryAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe inflammatory disease in the lungs, and both the onset and resolution of ARDS appears to be regulated primarily by alveolar macrophages. Emergent strains of human adenovirus (Ad) can induce ARDS in healthy immunocompetent people, whereas most, common Ad infections go unnoticed or causes minimal symptoms. Why emergent strains of Ad, such as Ad14p1, are more likely to induce acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS is unknown. Cells that die from wild type Ad14 infection have been shown to repress alveolar macrophage inflammatory responses, whereas cells dying from Ad14p1 infection enhance inflammatory responses of alveolar macrophages. Here, we explored whether virus induced changes in the expression of cellular small regulatory RNAs could explain the differential effects of virally infected cells on alveolar macrophage inflammatory responses. The data show that there are differences in small RNA expression between Ad14 and Ad14p1 infected cells at late times after infection, when Ad14p1 infected cells lose expression of the small RNAs that repress pro-inflammatory cellular signaling pathways in macrophages. Our study provides insights into a mechanism that could drive the increased pathogenesis of some outbreak strains of adenovirus.",

    "abstract": "The Rhabdochlamydiaceae family is a recent addition to the Chlamydiales order. Its members were discovered in cockroaches and woodlice but recent metagenomics surveys demonstrated the widespread distribution of this family in the environment. It was moreover estimated to be the largest family of the Chlamydiales order based on 16S rRNA encoding gene diversity. Unlike most chlamydia-like organisms, no Rhabdochlamydiaceae could be co-cultivated in amoebae and its host range remains largely unknown. Here, we tested the permissivity of various mammalian and arthropod cell lines to determine the host range of Rhabdochlamydia porcellionis, the only cultured representative of this family. While a growth could initially only be obtained in the Sf9 cell line, lowering the incubation temperature of the mammalian cells from 37 {degrees}C to 28 {degrees}C allowed R. porcellionis to grow in those cells. Furthermore, a 6 h exposure to 37 {degrees}C was sufficient to irreversibly block the replication of R. porcellionis, suggesting that this bacterium either lost or never acquired the ability to grow at 37 {degrees}C. We next sought to determine if temperature would also affect the infectivity of elementary bodies. Although we could not purify enough bacteria to reach a conclusive result for R. porcellionis, our experiment showed that the elementary bodies of Chlamydia trachomatis and Waddlia chondrophila lose their infectivity faster at 37 {degrees}C than at room temperature. Our results demonstrate that members of the Chlamydiales adapt to the temperature of their host organism and that this adaptation can in turn restrict their host range.\n\nImportanceThe Rhabdochlamydiaceae family is part of the Chlamydiales, a bacterial order that includes obligate intracellular bacteria sharing the same biphasic developmental cycle. This family have been shown to be highly prevalent in the environment, particularly in freshwater and soil and despite being estimated to be the largest family in the Chlamydiales order, is only poorly studied. Members of the Rhabdochlamydiaceae have been detected in various arthropods like ticks, spiders, cockroaches and woodlice, but the full host range of this family is currently unknown. In this study, we showed that R. porcellionis, the only cultured representative of the Rhabdochlamydiaceae family cannot grow at 37 {degrees}C and is quickly inactivated at this temperature. A similar temperature sensitivity was also observed for elementary bodies of chlamydial species adapted to mammals. Our work demonstrates that some chlamydiae adapt to the temperature of their reservoir, making a jump between species with different body temperatures unlikely.",

    "abstract": "To coordinate cellular physiology, eukaryotic cells rely on the inter-organelle transfer of molecules at specialized organelle-organelle contact sites1,2. Endoplasmic reticulum-mitochondria contact sites (ERMCSs) are particularly vital communication hubs, playing key roles in the exchange of signaling molecules, lipids, and metabolites3. ERMCSs are maintained by interactions between complementary tethering molecules on the surface of each organelle4,5. However, due to the extreme sensitivity of these membrane interfaces to experimental perturbation6,7, a clear understanding of their nanoscale structure and regulation is still lacking. Here, we combine 3D electron microscopy with high-speed molecular tracking of a model organelle tether, VAPB, to map the structure and diffusion landscape of ERMCSs. From EM reconstructions, we identified subdomains within the contact site where ER membranes dramatically deform to match local mitochondrial curvature. In parallel live cell experiments, we observed that the VAPB tethers that mediate this interface were not immobile, but rather highly dynamic, entering and leaving the site in seconds. These subdomains enlarged during nutrient stress, indicating ERMCSs can readily remodel under different physiological conditions. An ALS-associated mutation in VAPB altered the normal fluidity of contact sites, likely perturbing effective communication across the contact site and preventing remodeling. These results establish high speed single molecule imaging as a new tool for mapping the structure of contact site interfaces and suggest that the diffusion landscape of VAPB is a crucial component of ERMCS homeostasis.",

While current theory and biogeochemical models suggest microbial carbon-use efficiency and growth rate are positive predictors of SOC, recent observations demonstrate these relationships can be positive, negative, or neutral. To parse these contradictory effects, we used a 13C-labeling experiment to test whether different microbial traits influenced the transformation of plant C into SOC within the microbial habitats surrounding living root inputs (rhizosphere) versus decaying root litter (detritusphere), under both normal soil moisture and droughted conditions. In the rhizosphere, bacterial-dominated communities with fast growth, high carbon-use efficiency, and high production of extracellular polymeric substances formed microbial-derived SOC under normal moisture conditions. However, in the detritusphere - and the rhizosphere under drought - more fungal-dominated communities with slower growth but higher exoenzyme activity formed plant-derived SOC. These findings emphasize that microbial traits linked with SOC accrual are not universal, but contingent on how microorganisms allocate carbon under different resource conditions and environmental stressors.",

    "abstract": "An important question in evolutionary biology is whether and in what ways genotype-phenotype (GP) map biases can influence evolutionary trajectories. Untangling the relative roles of natural selection and biases (and other factors) in shaping phenotypes can be difficult. Because RNA secondary structure (SS) can be analysed in detail mathematically and computationally, is biologically relevant, and a wealth of bioinformatic data is available, it offers a good model system for studying the role of bias. For quite short RNA (length L [&le;] 126), it has recently been shown that natural and random RNA are structurally very similar, suggesting that bias strongly constrains evolutionary dynamics. Here we extend these results with emphasis on much larger RNA with length up to 3000 nucleotides. By examining both abstract shapes and structural motif frequencies (ie the numbers of helices, bonds, bulges, junctions, and loops), we find that large natural and random structures are also very similar, especially when contrasted to typical structures sampled from the space of all possible RNA structures. Our motif frequency study yields another result, that the frequencies of different motifs can be used in machine learning algorithms to classify random and natural RNA with quite high accuracy, especially for longer RNA (eg ROC AUC 0.86 for L = 1000). The most important motifs for classification are found to be the number of bulges, loops, and bonds. This finding may be useful in using SS to detect candidates for functional RNA within  junk DNA regions.",

    "abstract": "Human infection with the intestinal nematode Strongyloides stercoralis is persistent unless effectively treated, and potentially fatal in immunosuppressed individuals. Epidemiological data are lacking due to inadequate diagnosis. A rapid antigen detection test is a priority for population surveillance, validating cure after treatment, and for screening prior to immunosuppression. We analysed open access  omics data sets and used online predictors to identify S. stercoralis proteins that are likely to be present in infected stool, Strongyloides-specific, and antigenic. Transcriptomic data from gut and non-gut dwelling life cycle stages of S. stercoralis revealed 328 proteins that are differentially expressed. Strongyloides ratti proteomic data for excreted and secreted (E/S) proteins were matched to S. stercoralis, giving 1,057 orthologues. Five parasitism-associated protein families (SCP/TAPS, prolyl oligopeptidase, transthyretin-like, aspartic peptidase, acetylcholinesterase) were compared phylogenetically between S. stercoralis and outgroups, and proteins with least homology to the outgroups were selected. Proteins that overlapped between the transcriptomic and proteomic datasets were analysed by multiple sequence alignment, epitope prediction and 3D structure modelling to reveal S. stercoralis candidate peptide/protein coproantigens. We describe 22 candidates from seven genes, across all five protein families for further investigation as potential S. stercoralis diagnostic coproantigens, identified using open access data and freely-available protein analysis tools. This powerful approach can be applied to many parasitic infections with  omic data to accelerate development of specific diagnostic assays for laboratory or point-of-care field application.\n\nAuthor summaryThe worm Strongyloides stercoralis causes infectious disease in people throughout tropical and sub-tropical regions, leading to an extensive reduction in quality of life and even death. Millions of people are at risk of infection with this parasite and improved diagnostic and control methods and technologies are urgently required. Currently, most diagnosis is carried out through methods involving visual inspection of patients faeces, which has a number of drawbacks, particularly its poor sensitivity. This paper presents a new method to develop improved diagnostic tests for S. stercoralis, by computational analysis of publicly available gene and protein sequences to predict proteins that may be detectable in faeces. This would enable the development of rapid diagnostic tests in the form of lateral flows or dipsticks, with better predictive ability and fewer drawbacks than current diagnostic methods. A number of potential proteins, predicted to have all the desired characteristics for use in such tests were found through the new method and have been presented in this paper. With validation, new diagnostic tests for S. stercoralis could be developed from these results and the computational approach could be used to target other parasitic diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundType 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterised by the loss of pulsatile insulin secretion. We studied mice with {beta}-cell specific loss of the glucagon receptor (Gcgr fl/fl X Ins-1Cre), to investigate the role of intra-islet glucagon receptor signalling on pan-islet calcium oscillations and insulin pulsatility.\n\nMethodsFrequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests were conducted on Gcgr {beta}-cell-/- and littermate controls. Crossing with GCaMP6f (STOP flox) animals further allowed for {beta}-cell specific expression of a fluorescent calcium indicator. These islets were functionally imaged in vitro and in vivo. Wild-type mice were transplanted with islets expressing GCaMP6f in {beta}-cells into the anterior eye chamber and placed on a high fat diet. Part of the cohort received a glucagon analogue (GCG-analogue) for 40 days and the control group were fed to achieve weight matching. Calcium imaging was performed regularly during the development of hyperglycaemia and in response to GCG-analogue treatment.\n\nResultsGcgr {beta}-cell-/- mice exhibited impaired glucose tolerance following intraperitoneal glucose challenge (control 12.7mmol/L {+/-}0.6 vs. Gcgr {beta}-cell-/- 15.4mmol/L {+/-}0.0 at 15 min, p=0.002); fasting glycaemia was not different to controls. In vitro, Gcgr {beta}-cell-/- islets showed profound loss of synchronised calcium waves in response to glucose which was only partially rescued in vivo. First-phase insulin pulsatility on peripheral blood sampling (n=5) was significantly disordered in Gcgr {beta}-cell-/- mice (burst mass Gcgr {beta}-cell-/- 0.30 {+/-}0.03 versus 0.84 {+/-}0.23 for controls p=0.04). Diet induced obesity and hyperglycaemia resulted in a loss of co-ordinated [Ca2+]I waves in transplanted islets. This was reversed with GCG-analogue treatment, independently of weight-loss (n=8).\n\nConclusionThese data provide novel evidence for the role of intra-islet GCGR signalling in sustaining synchronised calcium oscillations and support a possible therapeutic role for glucagonergic agents to restore the insulin pulsatility lost in T2D.",

    "abstract": "The power of single-channel patch-clamp recordings is widely acknowledged among ion channel enthusiasts. The method allows observing the action of a single protein complex in real time and hence the deduction of the underlying conformational changes in the ion channel protein. Commonly, recordings are modeled using hidden Markov chains, connecting open and closed states in the experimental data with protein conformations. The rates between states denote transition probabilities that, for instance, could be modified by membrane voltage or ligand binding. Preferably, the time resolution of recordings should be in the range of microseconds or below, potentially bridging Molecular Dynamic simulations and experimental patch-clamp data. Modeling algorithms have to deal with limited recording bandwidth and a very noisy background. It was previously shown that the fit of 2-Dimensional-Dwell-Time histograms (2D-fit) with simulations is very robust in that regard. Errors introduced by the low-pass filter or noise cancel out to a certain degree when comparing experimental and simulated data. In addition, the topology of models, that is, the chain of open and closed states could be inferred from 2D-histograms. However, the 2D-fit was never applied to its full potential. The reason was the extremely time-consuming and unreliable fitting process, due to the stochastic variability in the simulations. We have now solved both issues by introducing a Message Passing Interface (MPI) allowing massive parallel computing on a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster and obtaining ensemble solutions. With the ensembles, we have optimized the fit algorithm and demonstrated how important the ranked solutions are for difficult tasks related to a noisy background, fast gating events beyond the corner frequency of the low-pass filter and topology estimation of the underlying Markov model. The fit can reliably extract events down to a signal-to-noise ratio of one and rates up to ten times higher than the filter frequency. It is even possible to identify equivalent Markov topologies. Finally, we have shown that, by combining the objective function of the 2D-fit with the deviation of the current amplitude distributions automatic determination of the current level of the conducting state is possible. It is even possible to infer the level with an apparent current reduction due to the application of the low-pass filter. Making use of an HPC cluster, the power of 2D-Dwell-Time analysis can be used to its fullest, allowing extraction of the matching Markov model from a time series with minor input of the experimenter. Additionally, we add the benefit of estimating the reliability of the results by generating ensemble solutions.",

    "abstract": "As a powerful but computationally intensive method, hybrid computational models study the dynamics of multicellular systems by evolving discrete cells in reacting and diffusing extracellular microenvironments. As the scale and complexity of studied biological systems continuously increase, the exploding computational cost starts to limit large-scale cell-based simulations. To facilitate the large-scale hybrid computational simulation and make it feasible on easily accessible computational devices, we develop a fast and memory-efficient open-source GPU-based hybrid computational modeling platform Gell (GPU Cell), for large-scale system modeling. We fully parallelize the simulations on GPU for high computational efficiency and propose a novel voxel sorting method to further accelerate the modeling of massive cell-cell mechanical interaction with negligible additional memory footprint. As a result, Gell efficiently handles simulations involving tens of millions of cells on a personal computer. We compare the performance of Gell with a state-of-the-art paralleled CPU-based simulator on a hanging droplet spheroid growth task and further demonstrate Gell with a ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) simulation. Gell affords ~150X acceleration over the paralleled CPU method with one-tenth of the memory requirement.\n\nAuthor SummaryNumerical cell simulations provide indispensable insight into the cell-to-tumor tissue transition and help reduce biological experimental variables. However, the availability and practicality of large-scale cell simulation tools have been limited by high computational cost, slow performance, or proprietary. Recent developments in open-source simulation codes and GPU implementation have partially addressed the challenge. We further optimized the cell simulation platform for GPU implementation in this work. As a result, benchmark cell simulation experiments can be performed efficiently on a personal computer with a modern GPU. We made the platform open source to encourage community adoption and collective development.",

We have shown that IL-10R-deficient colonic macrophages exhibit increased STAT1-dependent gene expression, suggesting that IL-10R-mediated inhibition of STAT1 signaling in newly recruited colonic macrophages might interfere with the development of an inflammatory phenotype. Indeed Stat1-/- mice exhibit defects in colonic macrophage accumulation following Helicobacter hepaticus infection and IL-10R blockade, and this was phenocopied in mice lacking IFNGR, an inducer of STAT1 activation. Radiation chimeras demonstrated that reduced accumulation of STAT1-deficient macrophages was based on a cell-intrinsic defect. Unexpectedly, mixed radiation chimeras generated with both WT and IL-10R-deficient bone marrow indicated that rather than directly interfering with STAT1 function, IL-10R prevents the generation of a cell extrinsic signal that promotes the accumulation of immature macrophages. These results define essential mechanisms controlling inflammatory macrophage accumulation in inflammatory bowel diseases.\n\nSummaryIntrinsic STAT1-function drives the accumulation of macrophages within the colon following the loss of IL-10R signaling.

    "abstract": "Prior studies have shown that neuronal spikes can be recorded with microelectrode arrays placed on the cortical surface. However, the etiology of these spikes remains unclear. Because the top cortical layer (layer 1) contains very few neuronal cell bodies, it has been proposed that these spikes originate from neurons with cell bodies in layer 2. To address this question, we combined two-photon calcium imaging with electrophysiological recordings from the cortical surface in awake mice using chronically implanted PEDOT:PSS electrode arrays on transparent parylene C substrate.\n\nOur electrode arrays (termed Windansee) were integrated with cortical windows offering see-through optical access while also providing measurements of local field potentials (LFP) and multiunit activity (MUA) from the cortical surface. To enable longitudinal data acquisition, we have developed a mechanical solution for installation, connectorization, and protection of Windansee devices aiming for an unhindered access for high numerical aperture microscope objectives and a lifetime of several months while worn by a mouse.\n\nContrary to the common notion, our measurements revealed that only a small fraction of layer 2 neurons from the sampled pool (~13%) faithfully followed MUA recorded from the surface above the imaging field-of-view. Surprised by this result, we turned to computational modeling for an alternative explanation of the MUA signal. Using realistic modeling of neurons with back-propagating dendritic properties, we computed the extracellular action potential at the cortical surface due to firing of local cortical neurons and compared the result to that due to axonal inputs to layer 1. Assuming the literature values for the cell/axon density and firing rates, our modeling results show that surface MUA due to axonal inputs is over an order of magnitude larger than that due to firing of layer 2 pyramidal neurons.\n\nThus, a combination of surface MUA recordings with two-photon calcium imaging can provide complementary information about the input to a cortical column and the local circuit response. Cortical layer I plays an important role in integration of a broad range of cortico-cortical, thalamocortical and neuromodulatory inputs. Therefore, detecting their activity as MUA while combining electrode recording with two-photon imaging using optically transparent surface electrode arrays would facilitate studies of the input/output relationship in cortical circuits, inform computational circuit models, and improve the accuracy of the next generation brain-machine interfaces.",

We investigate how the diversity of ongoing threats and conservation measures contribute to the likelihood and extent of recoveries. For birds, long-term recoveries were less likely among species impacted by a greater diversity of threats, although this may be mitigated by the diversity of conservation measures in place. Similarly, for mammals, populations with reported threats recovered less quickly while those with management actions in place recovered more quickly.

    "abstract": "Integrating sensory information during movement and adapting motor plans over successive movements are both essential for accurate, flexible motor behavior. When an ongoing movement is off target, feedback control mechanisms update the descending motor commands to counter the sensed error. Over longer timescales, errors induce adaptation in feedforward planning so that future movements become more accurate and require less online adjustment from feedback control processes. Both the degree to which sensory feedback is integrated into an ongoing movement and the degree to which movement errors drive adaptive changes in feedforward motor plans have been shown to scale inversely with sensory uncertainty. However, since they have only been studied in isolation of each other, little is know about how they respond to sensory uncertainty in real-world movement contexts where they co-occur. Here, we show that sensory uncertainty impacts feedforward adaptation of reaching movements differently when feedback integration is present versus when it is absent. In particular, participants gradually adjust their movements from trial-to-trial in a manner that is well characterised by a slow and consistent envelope of error reduction. Riding on top of this slow envelope, participants display large and abrupt changes in their initial movement vectors that clearly correlate with the degree of sensory uncertainty present on the previous trial. However, these abrupt changes are insensitive to the magnitude and direction of the sensed movement error. These results prompt important questions for current models of sensorimotor learning under uncertainty and open up exciting new avenues for future exploration.\n\nAuthor SummaryA large body of literature shows that sensory uncertainty inversely scales the degree of error-driven corrections made to motor plans from one trial to the next. However, by limiting sensory feedback to the endpoint of movements, these studies prevent corrections from taking place during the movement. Here, we show that when such corrections are promoted, sensory uncertainty punctuates between-trial movement corrections with abrupt changes that closely track the degree of sensory uncertainty but are insensitive to the magnitude and direction of movement error. This result marks a significant departure from existing findings and opens up new paths for future exploration.",

    "abstract": "Reducing the level of microtubule-associated protein tau has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic approach for a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Among the various approaches, targeted protein degradation provides a reversible means to rapidly reduce and specifically target disease-relevant forms of tau. However, in aging cells, the protein turnover activity is generally weakened, reducing the efficacy of protein degradation. A potential solution to this is to harness the nuclear proteasomal activity. The nucleus has a high proteasomal content and the degradation activity remains relatively unaffected even in aged cells. Here we show that an E3 ligase F-box domain from the nuclear protein human speckle type BTB/POZ protein (SPOP) is effective in degrading the microtubule-associated protein tau in primary mouse hippocampal neurons. Using EGFP-tagged tau and a GFP-binding nanobody fused to SPOP, we found that the native nuclear localization signal in SPOP causes nuclear sequestration of the target protein. However, degradation of the sequestered target proteins is incomplete, resulting in nuclear accumulation. Replacing the native SPOP nuclear localization signal (NLS) with variants having altered nuclear localization efficiency dramatically affects in the degree of nuclear accumulation of the target protein. Interestingly, nanobody-SPOP with no NLS was more efficient than that with a NLS in reducing overall tau level, causing an approximately 50% reduction in ectopically expressed human tau in mouse neurons.

    "abstract": "Advances in omics technologies have allowed spatially resolved molecular profiling of single cells, providing a window not only into the diversity and distribution of cell types within a tissue, but also into the effects of interactions between cells in shaping the transcriptional landscape. Cells send chemical and mechanical signals which are received by other cells and transduced through signaling cascades from the membrane to the nucleus, where they can subsequently initiate context-specific gene regulatory responses. These interactions and their responses shape the individual molecular phenotype of a cell in a given microenvironment. RNAs or proteins measured in individual cells together with the cells spatial distribution provide invaluable information about these mechanisms and the regulation of genes beyond processes occurring independently in each individual cell. \"SpaCeNet\" is a method designed to elucidate both the intracellular molecular networks (capturing how molecular variables affect each other within the cell) and the intercellular molecular networks (how cells affect molecular variables in their neighbors). This is achieved by estimating conditional independence relations between captured variables within individual cells and by disentangling these from conditional independence relations between variables of different cells.",

    "abstract": "Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) serve a vital role in regulating gene expressions and other biological processes. Differentiation of lncRNAs from protein-coding transcripts helps researchers dig into the mechanism of lncRNA formation and its downstream regulations related to various diseases. Previous works have been proposed to identify lncRNAs, including traditional bio-sequencing and machine learning approaches. Considering the tedious work of biological characteristic-based feature extraction procedures and inevitable artifacts during bio-sequencing processes, those lncRNA detection methods are not always satisfactory. Hence, in this work, we presented lncDLSM, a deep learning-based framework differentiating lncRNA from other protein-coding transcripts without dependencies on prior biological knowledge. lncDLSM is a helpful tool for identifying lncRNAs compared with other biological feature-based machine learning methods and can be applied to other species by transfer learning achieving satisfactory results. Further experiments showed that different species display distinct boundaries among distributions corresponding to the homology and the specificity among species, respectively.

    "abstract": "MotivationExpert curation to differentiate between functionally diverged homologs and those that may still share a similar function routinely relies on the visual interpretation of domain architecture changes. However, the size of contemporary data sets integrating homologs from hundreds to thousands of species calls for alternate solutions. Scoring schemes to evaluate domain architecture similarities can help to automatize this procedure, in principle. But existing schemes are often too simplistic in the similarity assessment, many require an a-priori resolution of overlapping domain annotations, and those that allow overlaps to extend the set of annotations sources cannot account for redundant annotations. As a consequence, the gap between the automated similarity scoring and the similarity assessment based on visual architecture comparison is still too wide to make the integration of both approaches meaningful.\n\nResultsHere, we present FAS, a scoring system for the comparison of multi-layered feature architectures integrating information from a broad spectrum of annotation sources. Feature architectures are represented as directed acyclic graphs, and redundancies are resolved in the course of comparison using a score maximization algorithm. A benchmark using more than 10,000 human-yeast ortholog pairs reveals that FAS consistently outperforms existing scoring schemes. Using three examples, we show how automated architecture similarity assessments can be routinely applied in the benchmarking of orthology assignment software, in the identification of functionally diverged orthologs, and in the identification of entries in protein collections that most likely stem from a faulty gene prediction.\n\nAvailability and implementationFAS is available as python package: https://pypi.org/project/greedyFAS/",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour in adults. Hallmarks of glioblastoma include its intra-tumoural heterogeneity and extensive invasion of the surrounding brain. Glioblastoma is known to remodel the extracellular matrix (ECM) of the brain, resulting in altered mechanical properties and the establishment of a tumour-promoting microenvironment. How changes in the expression and spatial distribution of ECM constituents within glioblastoma contribute to invasion and disease progression is still unclear.\n\nMethodsHere we report on a protocol for laser-capture microdissection coupled with mass spectrometry (LCM-proteomics) that allowed a spatially resolved and unbiased analysis of the regional ECM proteome (matrisome) in formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples of human glioblastoma. We investigated five molecularly characterised hemispheric adult glioblastomas where the brain/tumour interface and tumour epicentre were represented in the surgical specimens and snap-frozen tissue was available. LCM-proteomic analysis was validated with immunohistochemistry.\n\nResultsLCM-proteomics identified 53 matrisome proteins in FFPE tissue, demonstrating comparable performance with conventional analysis of snap-frozen tissue. The analysis revealed distinct matrisome components in the brain/tumour interface versus the tumour epicentre. Guided by data from LCM-proteomic analysis, immunostaining for tenascin-R confirmed greater staining in the brain/tumour interface, whilst expression of fibronectin was higher in the tumour epicentre.\n\nConclusionThe protocol described in this work allowed for accurate, spatially resolved analysis of ECM in FFPE tissues, with performance comparable to analysis of snap-frozen tissue. While the focus for this work was on the regional ECM composition of glioblastoma, we found that the LCM-proteomics protocol is also applicable to the study of the wider proteome, and represents a valuable tool for investigating tumour/tissue heterogeneity. This protocol opens the possibility to apply LCM-proteomics to retrospective studies with the advantage of accessing clinical history and follow-up information, providing a valuable resource for translational research in glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "With overall five-year survival rate less than 10%, pancreatic cancer (PC) represents the most lethal one in all human cancers. Given that the incidence of PC is still increasing and current cancer treatment strategies are often inefficacious, its therapy is still a huge challenge. Here, we first revealed ovarian serous carcinoma is mostly anti-correlated with pancreatic cancer in gene expression signatures. Based on this observation, we proposed that ovarian cancer cells could defense PC. To confirm this strategy, we first showed that ovarian cancer cell SKOV3 can significantly inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cell SW1990 when they were co-cultured. We further validated this strategy by an animal model of pancreatic cancer xenografts. The result showed that the injection of SKOV3 significantly inhibits pancreatic cancer xenografts. Moreover, we found that SKOV3 with transgenic African elephant TP53 gene further enhances the therapeutic effect. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that the ovarian cancer cell treatment strikingly induced changes of genes being involved in pancreas function and phenotype (e.g. enhancing pancreas function, pancreas regeneration, and cell adhesion) but not immune and inflammation related functions, suggesting that the proposed strategy is different from immunotherapy and could be a novel strategy for cancer treatment.",

    "abstract": "Sophorolipids are biosurfactants derived from the non-pathogenic yeast Starmerella bombicola, with potential efficacy in anti-cancer applications. Simple and cost-effective synthesis of these drugs makes them a promising alternative to traditional chemotherapeutics, pending their success in preliminary drugscreening. Drug screening typically utilizes 2D cell monolayers due to their simplicity and potential for high-throughput assessment. However, 2D assays fail to capture the complexity and 3D context of the tumor microenvironment, and have consequently been implicated in the high percentage of drugs investigated in vitro that later fail in clinical trials. We screened two sophorolipid candidates and clinically-used chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin, on in vitro breast cancer models ranging from 2D monolayers to 3D spheroids, employing Optical Coherence Tomography to confirm these morphologies. We calculated corresponding IC50 values for these drugs and found one of the sophorolipids to have comparable toxicities to the chemotherapeutic control. Our findings show increased drug resistance associated with model dimensionality, such that all drugs tested showed that 3D spheroids exhibited higher IC50 values than their 2D counterparts. These findings demonstrate promising preliminary data to support the use of sophorolipids as a more affordable alternative to traditional clinical interventions and demonstrate the importance of 3D tumor models in assessing drug response.",

    "abstract": "Mental imagery is a process by which thoughts become experienced with sensory characteristics. Yet, it is not clear why mental images appear diminished compared to veridical images, nor how mental images are phenomenologically distinct from hallucinations, another type of non-veridical sensory experience. Current evidence suggests that imagination and veridical perception share neural resources. If so, we argue that considering how neural representations of externally-generated stimuli (i.e. sensory input) and internally-generated stimuli (i.e. thoughts) might interfere with one another can sufficiently differentiate veridical, imaginary, and hallucinatory perception. We here use a simple computational model of a serially-connected, hierarchical network with bidirectional information flow to emulate the primate visual system. We show that modelling even first-approximations of neural competition can more coherently explain imagery phenomenology than non-competitive models. Our simulations predict that, without competing sensory input, imagined stimuli should ubiquitously dominate hierarchical representations. However, with competition, imagination should dominate high-level representations but largely fail to outcompete sensory inputs at lower processing levels. To interpret our findings, we assume low-level stimulus information (e.g. in early visual cortex) contributes most to the sensory aspects of perceptual experience, while high-level stimulus information (e.g. towards temporal regions) contributes most to its abstract aspects. Our findings therefore suggest that ongoing bottom-up inputs during waking life may prevent imagination from overriding veridical sensory experience. In contrast, internally-generated stimuli may be hallucinated when sensory input is dampened or eradicated. Our approach can explain individual differences in imagery, along with aspects of daydreaming, hallucinations, and non-visual mental imagery.",

    "abstract": "Decisions about noisy stimuli are widely understood to be made by accumulating evidence up to a decision bound that can be adjusted according to task demands. However, relatively little is known about how such mechanisms operate in continuous monitoring contexts requiring intermittent target detection. Here, we examined neural decision processes underlying detection of 1-second coherence-targets within continuous random dot motion, and how they are adjusted across contexts with Weak, Strong, or randomly Mixed weak/strong targets. Our prediction was that decision bounds would be set lower when weak targets are more prevalent. Behavioural hit and false alarm rate patterns were consistent with this, and were well-captured by a bound-adjustable leaky accumulator model. However, beta-band EEG signatures of motor preparation contradicted this, instead indicating lower bounds in the Strong-target context. We thus tested two alternative models in which decision bound dynamics were constrained directly by Beta measurements, respectively featuring leaky accumulation with adjustable leak, and non-leaky accumulation of evidence referenced to an adjustable sensory-level criterion. We found that the latter model best explained both behaviour and neural dynamics, highlighting novel means of decision policy regulation and the importance of neurally-informed modelling.",

Here we show dissociated amplitude and phase effects of pre-stimulus alpha oscillation in a nested structure of rhythm- and sequence-based expectation. A visual stream of rhythmic stimuli was presented in a fixed sequence such that their temporal positions could be predicted by either the low-frequency rhythm, the sequence, or the combination. The behavioral modelling indicated that rhythmic and sequence information additively led to increased accumulation of sensory evidence and alleviated threshold for the perceptual discrimination of the expected stimulus. The electroencephalographical (EEG) results showed that the alpha amplitude was dominated by rhythmic information, with the amplitude fluctuating in the same frequency of the oscillation entrained by the rhythmic information (i.e., phase-amplitude coupling). The alpha phase, however, was affected by both rhythmic and sequence information. Importantly, rhythm-based expectation improved the perceptual performance by decreasing the alpha amplitude, whereas sequence-based expectation did not further decrease the amplitude on top of rhythm-based expectation. Moreover, rhythm-based and sequence-based expectation collaboratively improved the perceptual performance by biasing the alpha oscillation toward the optimal phase. Our findings suggested flexible coordination of multiscale brain oscillations in dealing with a complex environment.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between macroscale electrophysiological recordings and the dynamics of underlying neural activity remains unclear. We have previously shown that low frequency EEG activity (<1 Hz) is decreased at the seizure onset zone (SOZ), while higher frequency activity (1-50 Hz) is increased. These changes result in power spectral densities (PSDs) with flattened slopes near the SOZ, which are assumed to be areas of increased excitability. We wanted to understand possible mechanisms underlying PSD changes in brain regions of increased excitability. We hypothesize that these observations are consistent with changes in adaptation within the neural circuit.\n\nWe developed a theoretical framework and tested the effect of adaptation mechanisms, such as spike frequency adaptation and synaptic depression, on excitability and PSDs using filter-based neural mass models and conductance-based models. We compared the contribution of single timescale adaptation and multiple timescale adaptation.\n\nWe found that adaptation with multiple timescales alters the PSDs. Multiple timescales of adaptation can approximate fractional dynamics, a form of calculus related to power laws, history dependence, and non-integer order derivatives. Coupled with input changes, these dynamics changed circuit responses in unexpected ways. Increased input without synaptic depression increases broadband power. However, increased input with synaptic depression may decrease power. The effects of adaptation were most pronounced for low frequency activity (< 1Hz). Increased input combined with a loss of adaptation yielded reduced low frequency activity and increased higher frequency activity, consistent with clinical EEG observations from SOZs.\n\nSpike frequency adaptation and synaptic depression, two forms of multiple timescale adaptation, affect low frequency EEG and the slope of PSDs. These neural mechanisms may underlie changes in EEG activity near the SOZ and relate to neural hyperexcitability. Neural adaptation may be evident in macroscale electrophysiological recordings and provide a window to understanding neural circuit excitability.\n\nAuthor SummaryElectrophysiological recordings such as EEG from the human brain often come from many thousands of neurons or more. It can be difficult to relate recorded activity to characteristics of the underlying neurons and neural circuits. Here, we use novel theoretical framework and computational neural models to understand how neural adaptation might be evident in human EEG recordings. Neural adaptation includes mechanisms such as spike frequency adaptation and short-term depression that emphasize stimulus changes and help promote stability. Our results suggest that changes in neural adaptation affect EEG signals, especially at low frequencies. Further, adaptation can lead to changes related to fractional derivatives, a kind of calculus with non-integer orders. Neural adaptation may provide a window into understanding specific aspects of neuron excitability even from EEG recordings.",

A prominent hypothesis suggests that our brain re-uses body-based computations when we use tools. However, little is known about how this is implemented at the neural level. Here we used the ability to localize touch on both tools and body parts as a case study to fill this gap. Neural oscillations in the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (15-25 Hz) frequency bands are involved in mapping touch on the body in distinct reference frames. Alpha activity reflects the mapping of touch in external coordinates, whereas beta activity reflects the mapping of touch in skin-centered coordinates. Here, we aimed at pinpointing the role of these oscillations during tool-extended sensing. We recorded participants oscillatory activity while tactile stimuli were applied to either hands or the tips of hand-held rods. The posture of the hands/tool-tips was uncrossed or crossed at participants body midline in order for us to disentangle brain responses related to different coordinate systems. We found that alpha-band activity was modulated similarly across postures when localizing touch on hands and on tools, reflecting the position of touch in external space. Source reconstruction also indicated a similar network of cortical regions involved for tools and hands. Our findings strongly suggest that the brain uses similar oscillatory mechanisms for mapping touch on the body and tools, supporting the idea of neural processes being repurposed for tool-use.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTTool use is one of the defining traits of humankind.

    "abstract": "The events that initiate autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice remain poorly understood. CD4 and CD8 T cells are both required but whether either cell initiates disease is unclear. To test whether CD4 T cell infiltration into islet required damage to {beta} cells induced by autoreactive CD8 T cells, we selectively inactivated Wdfy4 in NOD mice (NOD.Wdfy4-/-) using CRISPR/Cas9 targeting. Similar to C57BL/6 Wdfy4-/- mice NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice develop type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1) that are unable to cross-present cell-associated antigens required to activate CD8 T cells. By contrast, cDC1 from heterozygous Wdfy4+/- mice can cross-present normally. Heterozygous NOD.Wdfy4+/- mice develop diabetes similar to NOD mice, but NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice neither develop diabetes nor prime autoreactive CD8 T cells in vivo. By contrast, NOD.Wdfy4-/- mice can process and present MHC-II-restricted autoantigens and can activate {beta} cell specific CD4 T cells in lymph nodes, and yet do not develop CD4 T cell infiltration in islets. These results indicate that the priming of autoreactive CD8 T cells in NOD mice requires cross-presentation by cDC1. Further, autoreactive CD8 T cells are required not only to develop diabetes, but to recruit autoreactive CD4 T cells into islets of NOD mice, perhaps in response to progressive {beta} cell damage.",

    "abstract": "The autophagy-flux-promoting protein TFG (Trk-fused gene) is up-regulated during B cell differentiation into plasma cells and supports survival of CH12 B cells. We hypothesized that quantitative proteomics analysis of CH12tfgKO B cells with intact or blocked autophagy-lysosome flux (via NH4Cl) will identify mechanisms of TFG-dependent autophagy, plasma cell biology and B cell survival. Analysis of CH12WT B cells in the presence of NH4Cl will identify proteins whose presence is continuously regulated by lysosomes independent of TFG. We determined hundreds of proteins to be controlled by TFG and/or NH4Cl. Notably, NH4Cl treatment alone increased the abundance of a cluster of cytosolic and mitochondrial translational proteins while it also reduced a number of proteins. Within the B cell relevant protein pool, BCL10 was reduced, while JCHAIN was increased in CH12tfgKO B cells. Furthermore, TFG regulated the abundance of transcription factors, such as JUNB, metabolic enzymes, such as the short-chain fatty acid activating enzyme ACOT9 or the glycolytic enzyme ALDOC. Gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed that TFG-regulated proteins localized to mitochondria and membrane-bounded organelles. Due to these findings we performed shotgun lipidomics of glycerophospholipids, uncovering that a particular phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) species, 32:0 PE, which lipidates LC3 most efficiently, was less abundant while phosphatidylglycerol (PG) was more abundant in CH12tfgKO B cells. In line with the role of PG as precursor for Cardiolipin (CL), the CL content was higher in CH12tfgKO B cells and addition of PG liposomes to B cells increased the amount of CL. We propose a role for TFG in B cell activation and plasma cell biology via regulation of proteins involved in germinal center and plasma cell development, such as BCL10 or JCHAIN, as well as in lipid homeostasis, mitochondria and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Persistence of large mammals in the Anthropocene depends on human willingness to coexist with them, but this is rarely incorporated into habitat suitability or conservation priority assessments. We propose a framework that integrates human willingness-to-coexist with habitat suitability assessments to identify areas of high potential for sustainable coexistence. We demonstrate its applicability for elephants and rhinos in the socio-ecological system of Maasai Mara, Kenya, by integrating spatial distributions of peoples willingness-to-coexist based on Bayesian hierarchical models using 556 household interviews, with socio-ecological habitat suitability mapping validated with long-term elephant observations from aerial surveys. Willingness-to-coexist was higher if people had little personal experience with a species, and strongly reduced by experiencing a species as a threat to humans. The sustainable coexistence potential framework highlights areas of low socio-ecological suitability, and areas that require more effort to increase positive stakeholder engagement to achieve long-term persistence of large herbivores in human-dominated landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The process of domestication has variable consequences on genome evolution leading to different phenotypic signatures. Access to the complete genome sequences of a large number of individuals makes it possible to explore the different facets of this domestication process. Here, we sought to explore the genome evolution of the Kluyveromyces lactis yeast species, a well-known species for its involvement in dairy processes but also present in natural environments. Using a combination of short and long-read sequencing strategies, we investigated the genomic variability of 41 Kluyveromyces lactis isolates and found that the overall genetic diversity of this species is very high ({pi} = 2.9 x 10-2) compared to other species such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae ({pi} = 3 x 10-3). However, the domesticated dairy population shows a reduced level of diversity ({pi} = 7 x 10-4), probably due to a domestication bottleneck. In addition, this entire population is characterized by the introgression of the LAC4 and LAC12 genes, responsible for lactose fermentation and coming from the closely related species, Kluyveromyces marxianus, as previously described. Our results also highlighted that the LAC4/LAC12 gene cluster was acquired through multiple and independent introgression events. Finally, we also identified several genes that could play a role in adaptation to dairy environments through copy number variation. These genes are involved in sugar consumption, flocculation and drug resistance, and may play a role in dairy processes. Overall, our study illustrates contrasting genomic evolution and sheds new light on the impact of domestication processes on it.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, extensive scientific efforts have been conducted to develop clean bio-energy technologies. A promising approach that has been under development for more than a hundred years is the microbial fuel cell (MFC) which utilizes exo-electrogenic bacteria as an electron source in a bio-electrochemical cell. The viability of bacteria in soil MFCs can be maintained by integrating plant roots which release organic materials that feed the bacteria. In this work, we show that rather than organic compounds, roots also release redox species that can produce electricity in a bio-fuel cell. We first study the reduction of the electron acceptor Cytochrome C by green onion roots. We integrate green onion roots into a bio-fuel cell to produce a continuous bias-free electric current for more than 24 h in the dark. This current is enhanced upon irradiation of light on the onions leaves. We apply cyclic voltammetry and 2D-fluorescence measurements to show that NADH and NADPH act as major electron mediators between the roots and the anode, while their concentration in the external root matrix is increased upon irradiation of the leaves. Finally, we show that roots can contribute to energy storage by charging a supercapacitor.",

Var|Decrypt offers a wide range of gene and variant filtering possibilities, clustering and enrichment tools, providing an efficient way to derive patient-specific functional information and to prioritize gene variants for functional analyses. We applied Var|Decrypt on WES datasets of 10 acute erythroid leukemia patients, a rare and aggressive form of leukemia, and recovered known disease oncogenes in addition to novel putative drivers. We additionally benchmarked Var|Decrypt on an independent dataset of ~90 multiple myeloma WES, recapitulating the identified deregulated genes and pathways, showing the general applicability and versatility of Var|Decrypt for WES analysis.",

Traction force microscopy is a method aimed at revealing these traction patterns for adherent cells on engineered substrates with known constitutive elastic properties from deformation information obtained from substrate images. Conventionally, the substrate deformation information is processed by numerical algorithms of varying complexity to give the corresponding traction field via solution of an ill-posed inverse elastic problem. We explore the capabilities of a deep convolutional neural network as a computationally more efficient and robust approach to solve this inversion problem.

The performance and the robustness of our approach against noise is systematically characterized for synthetic data, artificial cell models and real cell images, which are subjected to different noise levels.

    "abstract": "Mammary tumors in dogs hold great potential as naturally occurring breast cancer models in translational oncology, as they share the same environmental risk factors, key histological features, hormone receptor expression patterns, prognostic factors, and genetic characteristics as their human counterparts. We aimed to develop in vitro tools that allow functional analysis of canine mammary tumors (CMT), as we have a poor understanding of the underlying biology that drives the growth of these heterogeneous tumors. We established the long-term culture of 24 organoid lines from 16 patients, including organoids derived from normal mammary epithelium or benign lesions. CMT organoids recapitulated key morphological and immunohistological features of the primary tissue from which they were derived, including hormone receptor status. Furthermore, genetic characteristics (driver gene mutations, DNA copy number variations, and single-nucleotide variants) were conserved within tumororganoid pairs. We show how CMT organoids are a suitable model for in vitro drug assays and can be used to investigate whether specific mutations predict therapy outcomes. In addition, we could genetically modify the CMT organoids and use them to perform pooled CRISPR/Cas9 screening, where library representation was accurately maintained. In summary, we present a robust 3D in vitro preclinical model that can be used in translational research, where organoids from normal, benign as well as malignant mammary tissues can be propagated from the same patient to study tumorigenesis.",
