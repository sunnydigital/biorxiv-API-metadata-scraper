    "abstract": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the leading cause of disability worldwide. However, 30-50% of patients are unresponsive to commonly prescribed antidepressants, highlighting untapped causal biological mechanisms. Dysfunction in the microbiota-gut-brain axis, the bidirectional communications between the central nervous system and gastrointestinal tract that are modulated by gut microorganisms, has been implicated in MDD pathogenesis. Exposure to chronic stress disrupts blood-brain barrier integrity, still, little is known about intestinal barrier function in these conditions particularly for the small intestine where most food and drug absorption takes place. Thus, here we investigate how chronic social or variable stress, two mouse models of depression, impact the jejunum (JEJ) intestinal barrier in males and females. Mice were subjected to stress paradigms followed by analysis of gene expression profiles of intestinal barrier-related targets, fecal microbial composition, and blood-based markers. Altered microbial populations as well as changes in gene expression of JEJ tight junctions were observed depending on the type and duration of stress, with sex-specific effects. We took advantage of machine learning to characterize in detail morphological tight junction properties identifying a cluster of ruffled junctions in stressed animals. Junctional ruffling is associated with inflammation, so we evaluated if LPS injection recapitulates stress-induced changes in the JEJ and observed profound sex differences. Finally, LPS-binding protein (LBP), a marker of gut barrier leakiness, was associated with stress vulnerability in mice and translational value was confirmed on blood samples from women with MDD. Our results provide evidence that chronic stress disrupts intestinal barrier homeostasis in conjunction with the manifestation of depressive-like behaviors in a sex-specific manner in mice and possibly, human depression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAging and regeneration are heavily linked processes. While it is generally accepted that regenerative capacity declines with age, some vertebrates, such as newts, can bypass the deleterious effects of aging and successfully regenerate a lens throughout their lifetime.\n\nResultsHere, we used Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to monitor the lens regeneration process of larvae, juvenile, and adult newts. While all three life stages were able to regenerate a lens through transdifferentiation of the dorsal iris pigment epithelial cells (iPECs), an age-related decline in the kinetics of the regeneration process was observed. Consistent with these findings, iPECs from older animals exhibited a delay in cell cycle re-entry. Furthermore, it was observed that clearance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) was delayed in older organisms.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, our results suggest that although lens regeneration capacity does not decline throughout the lifespan of newts, the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular changes caused by aging alter the kinetics of this process. By understanding how aging affects lens regeneration in newts, we can gain important insights for restoring the age-related regeneration decline observed in most vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "SummaryPediatric brain and spinal cancer are the leading disease-related cause of death in children, thus we urgently need curative therapeutic strategies for these tumors. To accelerate such discoveries, the Childrens Brain Tumor Network and Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium created a systematic process for tumor biobanking, model generation, and sequencing with immediate access to harmonized data. We leverage these data to create OpenPBTA, an open collaborative project which establishes over 40 scalable analysis modules to genomically characterize 1,074 pediatric brain tumors. Transcriptomic classification reveals that TP53 loss is a significant marker for poor overall survival in ependymomas and H3 K28-altered diffuse midline gliomas and further identifies universal TP53 dysregulation in mismatch repair-deficient hypermutant high-grade gliomas. OpenPBTA is a foundational analysis platform actively being applied to other pediatric cancers and inform molecular tumor board decision-making, making it an invaluable resource to the pediatric oncology community.\n\nIn BriefThe OpenPBTA is a global, collaborative open-science initiative which brought together researchers and clinicians to genomically characterize 1,074 pediatric brain tumors and 22 patient-derived cell lines. Shapiro, et. al create over 40 open-source, scalable modules to perform cancer genomics analyses and provide a richly-annotated somatic dataset across 58 brain tumor histologies. The OpenPBTA framework can be used as a model for large-scale data integration to inform basic research, therapeutic target identification, and clinical translation.\n\nHighlightsOpenPBTA collaborative analyses establish resource for 1,074 pediatric brain tumors NGS-based WHO-aligned integrated diagnoses generated for 641 of 1,074 tumors RNA-Seq analysis infers medulloblastoma subtypes, TP53 status, and telomerase activity OpenPBTA will accelerate therapeutic translation of genomic insights",

    "abstract": "Recently a biochemistry experiment was developed to simultaneously capture the chromosomal conformations and DNA methylation levels on single cells. A computational tool to predict single-cell methylation levels based on single-cell Hi-C data becomes necessary due to the availability of this experiment. scHiMe was developed to predict the base-pair-specific methylation levels in the promoter regions genome-wide based on the single-cell Hi-C data and DNA nucleotide sequences using the graph transformer algorithm. Promoter-promoter spatial interaction networks were built based on single-cell Hi-C data, and single-cell DNA methylation levels on 1000 base pairs for each promoter were predicted based on the network topology and DNA sequence. Our evaluation results showed a high consistency between the predicted and the true methylation values. We tested using predicted DNA methylation levels on all promoters to classify cells into different cell types, and our results showed that the predicted DNA methylation levels resulted in almost perfect cell-type classification, which indicated that our predictions maintained the cell-to-cell variability. We also tested using the predicted DNA methylation levels of different subsets of promoters and different subsets of CpGs in promoters to classify cells and provided the promoters and CpGs that were most influential in cell-type clustering. Moreover, we observed slightly better performance for the nodes that have higher degree values in the promoter-promoter spatial interaction network but did not find a similar trend for more significant network influencers. Last but not least, we found that using the predicted methylation levels of only housekeeping genes led to less accurate cell-type clustering, which demonstrated that our methylation predictions fit the biological meanings of housekeeping genes since housekeeping genes usually have constant and similar genetic and epigenetic features among different types of cells. scHiMe is freely available at http://dna.cs.miami.edu/scHiMe/.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA methylation is the process of adding methyl groups to the DNA molecule without changing the nucleotide sequence, which can significantly change the activities of the DNA. Although DNA is a one-dimensional long sequence consisting of cytosine (C), guanine (G), adenine (A), and thymine (T), it folds into a three-dimensional structure in the nucleus of the cell. Scientists believe that this 3D structure has relationships with the activities of the DNA. This research uses deep learning to predict the DNA methylation status of each cytosine-guanine pair in the promoter regions of all human genes based on the 3D structure of the DNA. This not only adds a useful method to the computational biology field but also proves that 3D genome structure does have a relationship with DNA methylation. Moreover, the 3D genome and the DNA methylation are not based on a population of cells, but on individual cells, which provides a cell-specific perspective that allows the understanding of cell-to-cell variability.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox has spread unprecedentedly to nearly 100 countries and infected more than 51,000 people since 1 May 2022. This large-scale outbreak constituted a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), as declared by the World Health Organization. To better recognize and control this outbreak, we explore here through phylogenetic analysis the origins of MPXVs and their strains circulating in 2022, which remain unclear so far. Our results suggest that MPXVs possibly originated from some cowpox viruses and three lineages of MPXVs within Clade IIb circulated in 2022. Our results also suggest that two MPXVs respectively similar to the two MPXVs exported from Nigeria to the USA in 2021, ON676708/USA/2021 and ON676707/USA/2021, evolved into two lineages and sparked the large-scale outbreak in 2022, after their unknown evolutionary and epidemiological journeys possibly in Nigeria, the USA, or other countries before May 2022. This view does not stigmatize any country, because monkeypox is an endemic zoonosis in west Africa with wildlife reservoirs, and its large-scale outbreak in 2022 also resulted from the global decline of population immunity against smallpox due to the cease of vaccination against smallpox decades ago.",

Here, we assembled a database of 235,000 species to assess the worldwide distribution of plant life cycles. We found that annuals are half as common as previously thought (6% of all plant species). Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that annuals are favored under hot and dry conditions, especially under a prolonged dry season. Strikingly, this pattern remains consistent among different families, indicating convergent evolution. Moreover, we show that increasing climate variability and anthropogenic disturbance further increase the favorability of annuals. Overall, our analysis raises concerns for the future of ecosystem services provided by perennials because the ongoing climate and land-use changes are leading to an annuals-dominated world.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThis extensive update to plant life cycle biogeography deciphers their dependence on temperature, rainfall, and disturbance.",

    "abstract": "Continuous evolution of Omicron has led to a rapid and simultaneous emergence of numerous variants that display growth advantages over BA. 5. Despite their divergent evolutionary courses, mutations on their receptor-binding domain (RBD) converge on several hotspots. The driving force and destination of such convergent evolution and its impact on humoral immunity remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that these convergent mutations can cause striking evasion of neutralizing antibody (NAb) drugs and convalescent plasma, including those from BA.5 breakthrough infection, while maintaining sufficient ACE2 binding capability. BQ.1.1.10, BA.4.6.3, XBB, and CH. 1.1 are the most antibody-evasive strain tested, even exceeding SARS-CoV-1 level. To delineate the origin of the convergent evolution, we determined the escape mutation profiles and neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough-infection convalescents. Importantly, due to humoral immune imprinting, BA.2 and especially BA.5 breakthrough infection caused significant reductions in the epitope diversity of NAbs and increased proportion of non-neutralizing mAbs, which in turn concentrated humoral immune pressure and promoted convergent evolution. Moreover, we showed that the convergent RBD mutations could be accurately inferred by integrated deep mutational scanning (DMS) profiles, and the evolution trends of BA.2.75/BA.5 subvariants could be well-simulated through constructed convergent pseudovirus mutants. Together, our results suggest current herd immunity and BA.5 vaccine boosters may not provide good protection against infection. Broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and NAb drugs development should be highly prioritized, and the constructed mutants could help to examine their effectiveness in advance.",

    "abstract": "The corona virus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic and the resulting long-term neurological complications in patients, known as long COVID, have renewed the interest in the correlation between viral infections and neurodegenerative brain disorders. While many viruses can reach the central nervous system (CNS) causing acute or chronic infections (such as herpes simplex virus 1, HSV-1), the lack of a clear mechanistic link between viruses and protein aggregation into amyloids, a characteristic of several neurodegenerative diseases, has rendered such a connection elusive. Recently, we showed that viruses can induce aggregation of purified amyloidogenic proteins via the direct physicochemical mechanism of heterogenous nucleation (HEN). In the current study, we show that the incubation of HSV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 with human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leads to the amyloid aggregation of several proteins known to be involved in neurodegenerative diseases, such as: APLP1 (amyloid beta precursor like protein 1), ApoE, clusterin, 2-macroglobulin, PGK-1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), ceruloplasmin, nucleolin, 14-3-3, transthyretin and vitronectin. Importantly, UV-inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 does not affect its ability to induce amyloid aggregation, as amyloid formation is dependent on viral surface catalysis via HEN and not its ability to replicate. Our results show that viruses can physically induce amyloid aggregation of proteins in human CSF, and thus providing a potential mechanism that may account for the association between persistent and latent/reactivating brain infections and neurodegenerative diseases.",

However, the global impact of transcription-based regulation of chromosome organization remains elusive. Notably, the scale of genes and operons in bacteria remains well below the resolution of chromosomal contact maps generated using Hi-C (~ 5 - 10 kb), preventing to resolve the impact of transcription on genomic organization at the fine-scale. Here, we combined sub-kb Hi-C contact maps and chromosome engineering to visualize individual transcriptional units (TUs) while turning off transcription across the rest of the genome. We show that each TU forms a discrete, transcription-induced 3D domain (TIDs). These local structures impose mechanical and topological constraints on their neighboring sequences at larger scales, bringing them closer together and restricting their dynamics. These results show that the primary building blocks of bacteria chromosome folding consists of transcriptional domains that together shape the global genome structure.",

    "abstract": "The production of enterovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) which lack the viral genome have great potential as vaccines for a number of diseases, such as poliomyelitis and hand, foot-and-mouth disease. These VLPs can mimic empty capsids, which are antigenically indistinguishable from mature virions, produced naturally during viral infection. Both in infection and in vitro, capsids and VLPs are generated by the cleavage of the P1 precursor protein by a viral protease. Here, using a stabilised poliovirus 1 (PV-1) P1 sequence as an exemplar, we show the production of PV-1 VLPs in Pichia pastoris in the absence of the potentially cytotoxic protease, 3CD, instead using the porcine teschovirus 2A (P2A) peptide sequence to terminate translation between individual capsid proteins. We compare this to protease-dependent production of PV-1 VLPs. Analysis of all permutations of the order of the capsid protein sequences revealed that only VP3 could be tagged with P2A and maintain native antigenicity. Transmission electron microscopy of these VLPs reveals the classic picornaviral icosahedral structure. Furthermore, these particles were thermostable above 37{degrees}C, demonstrating their potential as next generation vaccine candidates for PV. Finally, we believe the demonstration that native antigenic VLPs can be produced using protease-independent methods opens the possibility for future enteroviral vaccines to take advantage of recent vaccine technological advances, such as adenovirus-vectored vaccines and mRNA vaccines, circumventing the potential problems of cytotoxicity associated with 3CD, allowing for the production of immunogenic enterovirus VLPs in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease present in more than 90 countries. Presently, there is no approved vaccine for human use. We have previously developed live attenuated L. mexicana Cen-/- (LmexCen-/-) as a vaccine candidate that showed excellent efficacy that was characterized by reduced activation of Th2 responses and enhanced Th1 responses, contrary to wild type L. mexicana (LmexWT) infection. Towards understanding the interplay between immune mechanisms of protection and metabolic reprogramming, we applied untargeted mass spectrometric analysis to LmexCen-/- and compared them with LmexWT infection. Data showed that enriched pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in ears immunized with LmexCen-/- parasites, compared to naive and LmexWT-infected ears. This pathway is known to promote an M1 phenotype in macrophages, suggesting a switch to a pro-inflammatory phenotype following LmexCen-/- inoculation. Accordingly, inhibition of the PPP in macrophages cultured with LmexCen-/- parasites led to diminished production of nitric oxide, IL-12, and IL-1{beta}, hallmarks of classical activation. Overall, our study revealed novel immune regulatory mechanisms that may be critical for the induction of protective immunity.",

    "abstract": "Environmental harsh conditions are one of the main challenges to the survivability of bacteria during microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) process. Due to the high resistivity of endospores against inhospitable conditions in comparison with vegetative cells, different sporulation methods were applied to Lysinibacillus sphaericus strain MB284 by changing the environmental conditions to investigate the growth of germinated cells. It was found that the sporulation yield was more when both carbon source starvation and the thermal shock process were applied to this bacterium. In addition, extending the sporulation time of cells into the minimal medium at 2 {degrees}C for a couple of weeks had a great impact on improving the sporulation yield. Comparing the growth rate of germinated endospores in natural conditions (pH 7 and 25 {degrees}C) and harsh conditions (pH 12, temperature of -10 to 60 {degrees}C, salinity up to 100 g/l) showed that endospores generated by thermal shock are able to germinate in almost every inhospitable condition except at low pH ([~]3). Finally, exposing generated endospores before germination to harsh conditions (carbon source starving, high and low pH and temperature, and desiccation) for a nearly long period (to 100 days) showed that only low pH([~]3) had a negative effect on the germination process and bacterial growth curve that indicated endospore of strain MB284 can be an appropriate solution for the problem of the survivability of bioagents in MICP. These results will provide helpful information about preparing and applying endospores of L. sphaericus for crack healing in concrete.\n\nImportanceIn the bio-self-healing process, bacterial cells are responsible for the production of calcium carbonate to fill cracks in the concrete. Since cracks can happen at any time, cells must survive under harsh conditions in concrete for a long period. This study for the first time investigates different endosporulation methods to find the best well-formed endospores for microbial-inducing calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). This study shows that the endospores of strain MB284 formed by the thermal shock can survive under inhospitable conditions including different ranges of temperatures (-4 to 60 {degrees}C), pH (3 to 14), salinity (up to 100 g/l), and starvation for about 100 days. Furthermore, the bacterial growth rate and the kinetics of calcium carbonate production by germinated endospores and vegetative cells were similar to each other that indicate endospores of strain MB284 formed by the thermal shock method developed in this study are good candidates for the MICP process.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/508202v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1996544org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c75d69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c5b728org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17bb25d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Group B enteroviruses, including coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), can persistently infect cardiac tissue and cause dilated cardiomyopathy. Persistence is linked to 5 terminal deletions of viral genomic RNAs that have been detected together with minor populations of full-length genomes in human infections. In this study, we explored the functions and interactions of the different viral RNA forms found in persistently-infected patients and their putative role(s) in pathogenesis. Since enterovirus cardiac pathogenesis is linked to the viral proteinase 2A, we investigated the effect of different terminal genomic RNA deletions on 2A activity. We discovered that 5 terminal deletions in CVB3 genomic RNAs decreased the proteinase activity of 2A but could not abrogate it. Using newly-generated viral reporters encoding nano-luciferase, we found that 5 terminal deletions resulted in decreased levels of viral protein and RNA synthesis in singly-transfected cardiomyocyte cultures. Unexpectedly, when full-length and terminally deleted forms were co-transfected into cardiomyocytes, a cooperative interaction was observed, leading to increased viral RNA and protein production. However, when viral infections were carried out in cells harboring 5 terminally deleted CVB3 RNAs, a decrease in infectious particle production was observed. Our results provide a possible explanation for the necessity of full-length viral genomes during persistent infection, as they would stimulate efficient viral replication compared to that of the deleted genomes alone. To avoid high levels of viral particle production that would trigger cellular immune activation and host cell death, the terminally deleted RNA forms act to limit the production of viral particles, possibly as trans-dominant inhibitors.\n\nImportanceEnteroviruses like coxsackievirus B3 are able to initiate acute infections of cardiac tissue and, in some cases, to establish a long-term persistent infection that can lead to serious disease sequelae, including dilated cardiomyopathy. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of 5 terminally-deleted forms of enterovirus RNAs in heart tissues derived from patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. These deleted RNAs are found in association with very low levels of full-length enterovirus genomic RNAs, an interaction that may facilitate continued persistence while limiting virus particle production. Even in the absence of detectable infectious virus particle production, these deleted viral RNA forms express viral proteinases at levels capable of causing viral pathology. Our studies provide mechanistic insights into how full length and deleted forms of enterovirus RNA cooperate to stimulate viral protein and RNA synthesis without stimulating infectious viral particle production. They also highlight the importance of targeting enteroviral proteinases to inhibit viral replication while at the same time limiting the long-term pathologies they trigger.",

    "abstract": "The majority of fast, excitatory synaptic transmission in the central nervous system (CNS) is mediated by -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), which are glutamate-activated ion channels integral to synaptic plasticity, motor coordination, learning, and memory. AMPARs are multiprotein assemblies comprised of a tetrameric receptor core that co-assembles with a broad range of peripheral auxiliary proteins which shape subcellular localization and signaling properties of the resulting complexes. Structure determination of AMPARs has traditionally relied on recombinant expression systems; however, these methods are not well suited to elucidate the diverse array of AMPAR assemblies that are differentially expressed in mammalian brains. While recent studies of native receptor complexes have advanced our understanding of endogenous assemblies, receptors thus far have only been isolated from rodent brain tissue. Here, we employed an immunoaffinity purification strategy to isolate native AMPARs from the brains of three different mammals - pigs, sheep, and cows. Compared to rodents; pigs, sheep, and cows are from a unique clade of mammals - ungulates, that share a closer genomic identity with humans. We determined the molecular size, overall yield, and purity of native AMPARs isolated from these three mammals, thereby demonstrating that structural determination and biochemical analysis is possible from a clade of mammals evolutionarily distinct from rodents.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus responsible for one of the most serious, modern worldwide pandemics, with lasting and multi-faceted effects. By late 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 180 million people and has killed more than 3 million. The virus gains entrance to human cells through binding to ACE2 via its surface spike protein and causes a complex disease of the respiratory system, termed COVID-19. Vaccination efforts are being made to hinder the viral spread and therapeutics are currently under development. Towards this goal, scientific attention is shifting towards variants and SNPs that affect factors of the disease such as susceptibility and severity. This genomic grammar, tightly related to the dark part of our genome, can be explored through the use of modern methods such as natural language processing. We present a semantic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 related publications, which yielded a repertoire of SNPs, genes and disease ontologies. Population data from the 100Genomes Project were subsequently integrated into the pipeline. Data mining approaches of this scale have the potential to elucidate the complex interaction between COVID-19 pathogenesis and host genetic variation; the resulting knowledge can facilitate the management of high-risk groups and aid the efforts towards precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Sacred lotus (Nelumbo nucifera) has been utilized as a food, medicine, and spiritual symbol for nearly 3,000 years. The medicinal properties of lotus are largely attributed to its unique profile of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids (BIAs), which includes potential anti-cancer, anti-malarial and anti-arrhythmic compounds. BIA biosynthesis in sacred lotus differs markedly from that of opium poppy and other members of the Ranunculales, most notably in an abundance of BIAs possessing the (R)-stereochemical configuration and the absence of reticuline, a major branchpoint intermediate in most BIA producers. Owing to these unique metabolic features and the pharmacological potential of lotus, we set out to elucidate the BIA biosynthesis network in N. nucifera. Here we show that lotus CYP80G (NnCYP80G) and a superior ortholog from Peruvian nutmeg (Laurelia sempervirens; LsCYP80G) stereospecifically convert (R)-N-methylcoclaurine to the proaporphine alkaloid glaziovine, which is subsequently methylated to pronuciferine, the presumed precursor to nuciferine. While sacred lotus employs a dedicated (R)-route to aporphine alkaloids from (R)-norcoclaurine, we implemented an artificial stereochemical inversion approach to flip the stereochemistry of the core BIA pathway. Exploiting the unique substrate specificity of dehydroreticuline synthase from common poppy (Papaver rhoeas) and pairing it with dehydroreticuline reductase enabled de novo synthesis of (R)-N-methylcoclaurine from (S)- norcoclaurine and its subsequent conversion to pronuciferine. We leveraged our stereochemical inversion approach to also elucidate the role of NnCYP80A in sacred lotus metabolism, which we show catalyzes the stereospecific formation of the bis-BIA nelumboferine. Screening our collection of 66 plant O-methyltransferases enabled conversion of nelumboferine to liensinine, a potential anti-cancer bis-BIA from sacred lotus. Our work highlights the unique benzylisoquinoline metabolism of N. nucifera and enables the targeted overproduction of potential lotus pharmaceuticals using engineered microbial systems.",

    "abstract": "Pseudaminic and legionaminic acids are a subgroup of nonulosonic acids (NulOs) unique to bacterial species. There is a lack of advances in the study of these NulOs due to their complex synthesis and production. Recently, it was seen that \"Candidatus Accumulibacter\" can produce Pse or Leg analogues as part of its extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). In order to employ a \"Ca. Accumulibacter\" enrichment as production platform for bacterial sialic acids, it is necessary to determine which fractions of the EPS of \"Ca. Accumulibacter\" contain NulOs and how to enrich and/or isolate them. We extracted the EPS from granules enriched with \"Ca. Accumulibcater\" and used size-exclusion chromatography to separate them into different molecular weight fractions. This separation resulted in two high molecular weight (> 5,500 kDa) fractions dominated by polysaccharides, with a NulO content up to 4 times higher than the extracted EPS. This suggests that NulOs in \"Ca. Accumulibacter\" are likely located in high molecular weight polysaccharides. Additionally, it was seen that the extracted EPS and the NulO-rich fractions can bind and neutralize histones. This suggest that they can serve as source for sepsis treatment drugs, although further purification needs to be evaluated.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/508216v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f59ff7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d933fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e3ff78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1994948_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LINulOs in \"Ca.

However, the continued use of these vaccines poses potential risks to the eradication of PV. The production of recombinant PV virus-like particles (VLPs), which lack the viral genome offer great potential as next-generation vaccines for the post-polio world. We have previously reported production of PV VLPs using Pichia pastoris, however, these VLPs were in the non-native conformation (C Ag), which would not produce effective protection against PV. Here, we build on this work and show that it is possible to produce wt PV-3 and thermally-stabilised PV-3 (referred to as PV-3 SC8) VLPs in the native conformation (D Ag) using Pichia pastoris. We show that the PV-3 SC8 VLPs provide a much-improved D:C antigen ratio as compared to wt PV-3, whilst exhibiting greater thermostability than the current IPV vaccine. Finally, we determine the cryo-EM structure of the yeast-derived PV-3 SC8 VLPs and compare this to previously published PV-3 D Ag structures, highlighting the similarities between these recombinantly-expressed VLPs and the infectious virus, further emphasising their potential as a next-generation vaccine candidate for PV.",

    "abstract": "1Halophilic microorganisms have long been known to survive within the brine inclusions of salt crystals, as evidenced by the change in color for salt crystals containing pigmented halophiles. However, the molecular mechanisms allowing this survival has remained an open question for decades. While protocols for the surface sterilization of halite (NaCl) have enabled isolation of cells and DNA from within halite brine inclusions, \"-omics\" based approaches have faced two main technical challenges: (1) removal of all contaminating organic biomolecules (including proteins) from halite surfaces, and (2) performing selective biomolecule extractions directly from cells contained within halite brine inclusions with sufficient speed to avoid modifications in gene expression during extraction. In this study, we present methods to resolve these two technical challenges. In addition, we apply these methods to perform the first examination of the early acclimation of a model haloarchaeon (Halobacterium salinarum NRC-1) to halite brine inclusions. Examinations of the proteome of Halobacterium cells two months post-evaporation revealed a high degree of similarity with stationary phase liquid cultures, but with a sharp down-regulation of ribosomal proteins. Low quantities of RNA from halite brine inclusions corroborate the hypothesis of low transcriptional and translational activities. While proteins for central metabolism were part of the shared proteome between liquid cultures and halite brine inclusions, proteins involved in cell mobility (archaellum, gas vesicles) were either absent or less abundant in halite samples. Proteins unique to cells within brine inclusions included transporters, suggesting modified interactions between cells and the surrounding brine inclusion microenvironment. The methods and hypotheses presented here enable future studies of the survival of halophiles in both culture model and natural halite systems.",

    "abstract": "The colonic mucus layer and microbiota adhered to it are vital for mediating host metabolic, immune, and gut health. Yet, how intermittent fasting impacts these microbial communities and O-glycosylation of mucin proteins, the predominant component of the colonic mucus layer, remains largely unexplored. Here, using a C57BL/6J mouse model fed either a high-fat diet or normal chow, we examined the impact of a two-day a week fasting regimen on host physiology, faecal and colonic mucosal microbiota, and mucin O-glycosylation. Our results demonstrated distinct diet-specific impacts of intermittent fasting on host physiology; mice fed the high-fat diet had a lower body weight and improved glucose tolerance upon fasting, whilst there were no significant changes in mice fed the normal chow. This was observed despite the similar feed and energy intake between groups with and without fasting. There were significant changes in the faecal and colonic mucosal microbiota community structure and composition, and mucin O-glycosylation upon fasting in both dietary groups, but the specific nature of these alterations was diet-dependent. Correlation analysis revealed significant associations between fasting-mediated changes in the abundance of specific mucosal bacteria and O-glycan structures. While intermittent fasting is a popular means of extending healthy life expectancy, there is a lack of information on its impacts on the mucosal microbiota and colonic mucus layer, which are key determinants of gut health. Our study addresses this knowledge gap and serves as the first report on how intermittent fasting influences colonic mucin O-glycosylation and the associations between mucosal glycans and bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) are key regulatory proteins of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization. Cohesin extrudes DNA loops that are anchored by CTCF in a polar orientation. Here, we present direct evidence that CTCF binding polarity controls cohesin-mediated DNA looping. Using single-molecule imaging of CTCF-cohesin collisions, we demonstrate that a critical N-terminal motif of CTCF blocks cohesin translocation and DNA looping. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the intact cohesin-CTCF complex reveals that this CTCF motif ahead of zinc-fingers can only reach its binding site on the STAG1 cohesin subunit when the N-terminus of CTCF faces cohesin. Remarkably, a C-terminally oriented CTCF accelerates DNA compaction by cohesin. DNA-bound Cas9 and Cas12a ribonucleoproteins are also polar cohesin barriers, indicating that stalling is intrinsic to cohesin itself, and other proteins can substitute for CTCF in fruit flies and other eukaryotes. Finally, we show that RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) block cohesin-mediated DNA compaction in vitro and are enriched with cohesin subunits in vivo, likely forming TAD boundaries. Our results provide direct evidence that CTCF orientation and R-loops shape the 3D genome by directly regulating cohesin.",

    "abstract": "Thermorubin (THR) is an aromatic anthracenopyranone antibiotic active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. It is known to bind to the 70S ribosome at the intersubunit bridge B2a and was thought to inhibit factor-dependent initiation of translation and obstruct the accommodation of tRNAs into the A site. Here, we show that thermorubin causes ribosomes to stall in vivo and in vitro at internal and termination codons, thereby allowing the ribosome to initiate protein synthesis and translate at least a few codons before stalling. Our biochemical data show that THR affects multiple steps of translation elongation with a significant impact on the binding stability of the tRNA in the A site, explaining premature cessation of translation. Our high-resolution crystal and cryo-EM structures of the 70S-THR complex show that THR can co-exist with P- and A-site tRNAs, explaining how ribosomes can elongate in the presence of the drug. Remarkable is the ability of THR to arrest ribosomes at the stop codons. Our data suggest that by causing structural re-arrangements in the decoding center, THR interferes with the accommodation of tRNAs or release factors into the ribosomal A site.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThermorubin is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis both in vivo and in vitro;\nC_LIO_LIThermorubin does not prevent the binding of P- and A-site tRNAs;\nC_LIO_LIThermorubin affects multiple steps of translation elongation with a major impact on binding stability of the A-site tRNA;\nC_LIO_LIThermorubin can act as an inhibitor of translation termination on some ORFs.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAutism spectrum disorders affect more than one percent of the population, impairing social communication and increasing stereotyped behaviours. A micro-deletion of the 16p11.2 BP4-BP5 chromosomic region has been identified in one percent of patients also displaying intellectual disabilities. In mouse models generated to understand the mechanisms of this deletion, learning and memory deficits were pervasive in most genetic backgrounds, while social communication deficits were only detected in some models. Based on previous study (Arbogast et al. 2016 PLoS genetics), we selected the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion on a hybrid C57BL/6NxC3B genetic background to itemize the social deficits. We examined whether behavioural deficits observed in short observation periods were representative of the phenotype displayed by the same mice over long-term monitoring. We recorded the individual and social behaviours of 16p11.2 Del/+ mice and their wild-type littermates from both sexes in short-term (15 min) and long-term (over two and three consecutive nights) social interactions of familiar mixed-genotype quartets of males and of females, and of same-genotype unfamiliar female pairs.\n\nResultsWe observed that Del/+ mice of both sexes increased significantly their activity compared to wild-type littermates only over long-term monitoring. In the social domain, Del/+ mice of both sexes displayed only limited impairments over short-term monitoring, and more visible deficits over long-term monitoring. When recorded in quartets of familiar individuals, social impairments were stronger in males than in females. In pairs, significant perturbations of the organisation of the social communication and behaviours in Del/+ females appeared mostly over the long-term.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, this suggests that social and contextual variations affect the phenotype of the 16p11.2 Del/+ mice differently in the activity and the social domains. The social behaviour was also differently affected between the two sexes. These findings confirm the importance of testing models both in short- and long-term conditions to provide a comprehensive view of their phenotype that will be more robust for pre-clinical targeted therapeutic trials.",

    "abstract": "Advances in electron detection have been essential to the success of high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination. A new generation of direct electron detector called the Apollo, has been developed by Direct Electron. The Apollo uses a novel event-based MAPS detector custom designed for ultra-fast electron counting. We have evaluated this new camera, finding that it delivers high detective quantum efficiency (DQE) and low coincidence loss, enabling high-quality electron counting data acquisition at up to nearly 80 input electrons per pixel per second. We further characterized the performance of Apollo for single particle cryo-EM on real biological samples. Using mouse apoferritin, Apollo yielded better than 1.9 [A] resolution reconstructions at all three tested dose rates from a half-day data collection session each. With longer collection time and improved specimen preparation, mouse apoferritin was reconstructed to 1.66 [A] resolution. Applied to a more challenging small protein aldolase, we obtained a 2.24 [A] resolution reconstruction. The high quality of the map indicates that the Apollo has sufficiently high DQE to reconstruct smaller proteins and complexes with high-fidelity. Our results demonstrate that the Apollo camera performs well across a broad range of dose rates and is capable of capturing high quality data that produce high-resolution reconstructions for large and small single particle samples.",

    "abstract": "The cut-and-paste Hermes DNA transposase stands out among the transposases that have been biochemically or structurally characterized so far. Many transposases function as dimers, but the Hermes transposase forms a tetramer of dimers to achieve its active form in vivo. Intriguingly, the transposition complex, or transpososome, relies on only one dimer to perform the enzymatic reactions necessary to the mobilization of its transposon. Our investigation combining biochemical and structural approaches shows that the Hermes octamer extensively interacts with its transposon left-end (LE) engaging the BED domains of three Hermes protomers belonging to three dimers. By contrast, the right-end (RE) is entirely deprived of such interaction inside the transpososome. Our work suggests that formation of the Hermes synaptic complex is sequential and relies on the considerable difference of affinity of the transposase towards its transposon ends. Thus, we propose that Hermes dimers multimerize to gather enough BED domains to find the LE among the abundant genomic DNA, facilitating the subsequent interaction with the RE, most likely solely based on recognition of its terminal inverted repeat.",

However, the source of this advantage is unclear: Continuous feedback is more ecological, dynamic, and available earlier than endpoint feedback. Here we assess the relative merits of these factors using a method that allows us to manipulate feedback timing independent of actual hand position. By manipulating the onset time of  endpoint feedback, we found that adaptation was modulated in a non-monotonic manner, with the peak of the function occurring in advance of the hand reaching the target. Moreover, at this optimal time, learning was of similar magnitude as that observed with continuous feedback. By varying movement duration, we demonstrate that this optimal time occurs at a relatively fixed time after movement onset, an interval we hypothesize corresponds to when the comparison of the sensory prediction and feedback generates the strongest error signal.",

A measure of cortical organisation that integrates information from multi-modal MRI and is unbound by arbitrary parcellations has proven elusive, which hampers efforts to uncover the perinatal origins of cortical health. Here, we use the Vogt-Bailey index to provide a fine-grained description of regional homogeneities and sharp variations in cortical microstructure based on feature gradients, and we investigate the impact of being born preterm on cortical development. Preterm infants have a homogeneous microstructure in temporal and occipital lobes, and the medial parietal, cingulate, and frontal cortices, compared with term infants. These observations replicated across two independent datasets and were robust to differences that remain in the data after matching samples and alignment of processing and quality control strategies. We conclude that cortical microstructural architecture is altered in preterm infants in a spatially distributed rather than localised fashion.",

    "abstract": "The lung is constantly exposed to the outside world and optimal adaptation of immune responses is crucial for efficient pathogen clearance. However, mechanisms which lead to the functional and developmental adaptation of lung-associated macrophages remain elusive. To reveal such mechanisms, we developed a reductionist model of environmental intranasal {beta}-glucan exposure, allowing for the detailed interrogation of molecular mechanisms of pulmonal macrophage adaptation. Employing single-cell transcriptomics, high dimensional imaging and flow cytometric characterization paired to in vivo and ex vivo challenge models, we reveal that pulmonary low-grade inflammation results in the development of Dectin-1 - Card9 signaling-dependent monocyte-derived macrophages (MoAM). MoAMs expressed high levels of CD11b, ApoE, Gpnmb and Ccl6, were glycolytic and produced large amounts of interleukin 6 upon restimulation. Myeloid cell specific ApoE ablation inhibited monocyte to MoAM differentiation dependent on M-CSF secretion, promoting MoAM cell death thus impeding MoAM maintenance. In vivo, {beta}-glucan-elicited MoAMs limited the bacterial burden of Legionella pneumophilia post infection and ameliorated fibrosis severity in a murine fibrosis model. Collectively these data identify MoAMs that are generated upon environmental cues and ApoE as an important determinant for lung immune resilience.",

Neural progenitors acquire distinct cell identities depending on their spatial position, but they are also influenced by temporal cues to give rise to different cell populations over time. For instance, the progenitors of the cerebral neocortex generate different populations of excitatory projection neurons following a well-known sequence. The Notch signaling pathway plays crucial roles this process but the molecular mechanisms by which Notch impacts progenitor fate decisions have not been fully resolved. Here, we show that Notch signaling is essential for neocortical and hippocampal morphogenesis, and for the development of the corpus callosum and choroid plexus. Our data also indicate that, in the neocortex, Notch controls projection neuron fate determination through the regulation of two microRNA (miRNA) clusters that include let-7, miR-99a/100, and miR-125b. Our findings collectively suggest that balanced Notch signaling is crucial for telencephalic development and that the interplay between Notch and miRNAs is critical to control neocortical progenitor behaviors and neuron cell fate decisions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is the most common form of dementia. Its aetiology is characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) peptides into {beta}-sheet-rich A{beta} oligomers/fibrils. Whereas experimental studies have suggested that A{beta} oligomers/fibrils interact with the cell membranes and perturb their structures and dynamics, the molecular mechanism of this interaction is still not fully understood. In the present work, we have performed a total of 120 s-long simulations to investigate the interaction between trimeric or hexameric A{beta}1-40 fibrils with either a 100% DPPC bilayer, a 70% DPPC-30% cholesterol bilayer or a 50% DPPC-50 % cholesterol bilayer. Our simulation data capture the spontaneous binding of the aqueous A{beta}1-40 fibrils with the membranes and show that the central hydrophobic amino acid cluster, the lysine residue adjacent to it and the C-terminal hydrophobic residues are all involved in the process. Moreover, our data show that while the A{beta}1-40 fibril does not bind to the 100% DPPC bilayer, its binding affinity for the membrane increases with the amount of cholesterol. Overall, our data suggest that two clusters of hydrophobic residues and one lysine help A{beta}1-40 fibrils establish stable interactions with a cholesterol-rich DPPC bilayer. These residues are likely to represent potential target regions for the design of inhibitors, thus opening new avenues in structure-based drug design against A{beta} oligomer/fibril-membrane interaction.",

RNAseq database repository searches led us to identify the Nclx transcript as highly enriched in astrocytes when compared to neurons. To assess the role of NCLX in mouse primary culture astrocytes, we inhibited its function both pharmacologically or genetically. This resulted in re-shaping of cytosolic Ca2+ signaling and a metabolic shift that increased glycolytic flux and lactate secretion in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Interestingly, in vivo genetic deletion of NCLX in hippocampal astrocytes improved cognitive performance in behavioral tasks, whereas hippocampal neuron-specific deletion of NCLX impaired cognitive performance. These results unveil a role for NCLX as a novel modulator of astrocytic glucose metabolism, impacting on cognition.",

    "abstract": "IL-12 is a well-established driver of type 1 immune responses. Paradoxically, in several autoimmune conditions including neuroinflammation, IL-12 reduces pathology and exhibits regulatory properties. Yet, the mechanism and the involved cellular players behind this immune regulation remain elusive. To identify the IL-12-responsive elements which prevent immunopathology, we generated mouse models lacking a functional IL-12 receptor either in all cells or in specific populations within the immune or central nervous system (CNS) compartments, and induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which models human Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This revealed that the CNS tissue-protective features of IL-12 are mediated by cells of the neuroectoderm, and not immune cells. Importantly, sections of brain from patients with MS show comparable patterns of expression, indicating parallel mechanisms in humans. By combining spectral flow cytometry, bulk and single-nucleus RNA sequencing, we uncovered an IL-12-induced neuroprotective adaption of the neuroectoderm critically involved in maintaining CNS tissue integrity during inflammation.",
