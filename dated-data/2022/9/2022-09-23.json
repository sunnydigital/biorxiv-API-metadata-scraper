    "abstract": "Increasing numbers of horizontal transfer (HT) of genes and transposable elements are reported in insects. Yet the mechanisms underlying these transfers remain unknown. Here we firs t quantify and characterize the patterns of chromosomal integration of the polydnavirus (PDV) encoded by the Campopleginae Hyposoter didymator parasitoid wasp (HdIV) in somatic cells of parasitized fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda). Polydnaviruses are domesticated viruses injected by wasps together with their eggs into their hosts in order to facilitate the development of wasp larvae. We found that six HdIV DNA circles integrate into the genome of host somatic cells. Each host haploid genome suffers between 23 and 40 integration events (IEs) on average 72 hours post parasitism. Almost all IEs are mediated by DNA double strand breaks occurring in the host integration motif (HIM) of HdIV circles. We show that despite their independent evolutionary origins, PDV from both Campopleginae and Braconidae wasps use remarkably similar mechanisms for chromosomal integration. Next, our similarity search performed on 775 genomes reveals that PDVs of both Campopleginae and Braconidae wasps have recurrently colonized the germline of dozens of lepidopteran species through the same mechanisms they use to integrate into somatic host chromosomes during parasitism. We found evidence of HIM-mediated HT of PDV DNA circles in no less than 124 species belonging to 15 lepidopteran families. Thus, this mechanism underlies a major route of HT of genetic material from wasps to lepidopterans with likely important consequences on lepidopterans.",

    "abstract": "Temperature is thought to be a key variable explaining global patterns of species richness. However, to investigate this relationship carefully, it is necessary to study clades with broad geographic ranges that are comprised of species inhabiting diverse biomes with well- characterized species ranges. In the present study, we investigate the link between temperature and diversification in the butterfly family Pieridae (sulfurs and whites) by combining Next Generation sequences and published molecular data with fine-grained distribution information. After building the most comprehensive phylogeny of the group, with almost 600 species and all higher taxa (subfamilies, tribes and subtribes), we found strong support for the following relationships within the family: Dismorphiinae + (Coliadinae + (Pseudopontiinae + Pierinae)). With a curated distribution dataset of over 800,000 occurrences, we conducted multiple comparative phylogenetic analyses that provided strong evidence that species in environments with more stable daily temperatures or with cooler maximum temperatures in the warm seasons have higher diversification rates. We also found a positive correlation between speciation and extinction with paleotemperature: as global temperature decreased through geological time, so did diversification rates. Although many studies demonstrate higher diversity in the tropics, we have been able to identify specific climate variables associated with changes in diversification, while also inferring the most robust and well sampled phylogenomic framework for Pieridae to date.",

    "abstract": "Diverse microbial communities associated with the guts of their hosts are crucial for many aspects of their hosts physiology, ecology, and evolution. The gut microbiota has been characterized for a broad range of species across the animal kingdom. Yet, for many host species we still dont have a good understanding of whether non-lethal sampling (e.g., fecal matter) can accurately capture the diversity of gut-associated bacterial communities, as estimated from lethal sampling of intestinal tissue. We further lack knowledge on whether such non-lethal sampling methods are suitable for studying temporal gut microbiota dynamics. Here, we addressed these questions in threespine stickleback fish, a model system in evolutionary ecology, by comparing bacterial communities based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing from intestinal tissue and feces. Despite some differences in community composition between the two sample types, we show that bacterial communities of feces and intestinal tissue largely overlap. Further, we were able to detect consistent and significant changes of fecal bacterial communities associated with an experimental diet shift. These results suggest that fecal sampling represents an adequate non-lethal method to characterize the gut microbiota of threespine stickleback. This allows for studying temporal gut microbiota dynamics at the individual level, which increases opportunities for future experimental gut microbiota research.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential trace element that serves as a cofactor for enzymes involved in multiple metabolic pathways, including ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, DNA synthesis and repair, lipid metabolism, and mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In eukaryotes, iron deficiency leads to coordinated changes in gene expression and protein translation that activate iron uptake and allow metabolic adaptations of iron-dependent processes. While transcriptional responses to iron deprivation have been extensively characterized, little is known about the role of iron in regulating protein synthesis. In this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis of protein translation in yeast to identify transcripts translationally regulated under iron deficiency. We show that, upon iron depletion, a large set of genes necessary for mitochondrial protein synthesis is specifically down-regulated at the translational level. We demonstrate that this regulation is mediated through the activity of Cth1 and Cth2 mRNA-binding proteins. In addition, we uncover that Fe deficiency affects protein translation by limiting the activity of the conserved ribosome recycling factor Rli1. Together, these studies identified genes and pathways that are translationally regulated in response to iron deficiency and revealed a role of iron in translational control.",

    "abstract": "With approximately 4% of the worlds population using cannabis, there is need to fully understand how cannabis impacts our health. It is universally known that increased food intake is a side effect of cannabis use, also known as  the munchies, and it has been established that delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the major psychoactive cannabinoid in cannabis, drives these feeding effects. These appetitive effects of cannabis or THC have been modeled in humans and rodents but have not been fully explored. Therefore, the aim of this study was to use a translational pre-clinical model to characterise how inhalation of vapour from a THC-dominant cannabis extract alters daily feeding patterns and macronutrient-specific food preferences, with focus on microstructural feeding pattern analysis and potential sex differences.\n\nWe exposed adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats to THC-dominant cannabis vapour or vehicle vapour daily, then gave rats access to different foods (chow, high-carbohydrate, and/or high-fat food) and post-vapour feeding patterns measured. To study macronutrient-specific food preferences, rats were given a post-vapour choice between a high-carbohydrate and a high-fat food. To assess satiety, rats were given pre-vapour access to a palatable preload in which they readily consume to become satiated. For some animals, blood and brain samples were collected post-vapour to measure phytocannabinoid and metabolite levels using mass spectrometry.\n\nWe show that THC vapour inhalation increases food intake in the first hour after vapour exposure, an effect that is not dependent on food type, sex or whether animals are satiated or not. These feeding effects were a result of THC vapour decreasing feeding latency and increasing feeding bout frequency. Consistently, these acute feeding effects were compensated for through reductions in subsequent food intake, and THC vapour did not promote weight gain. THC also altered macronutrient-specific food preferences, increasing high-fat food preference in standard conditions, and increasing high-carbohydrate food preference in satiated conditions so that rats no longer significantly preferred one food over the other. Following vapour exposure, female rats had higher THC and metabolite concentrations in plasma and the hypothalamus than males and showed a stronger high-fat food preference following THC vapour compared to males when given a food choice.\n\nOverall, this study complements and builds upon previous clinical and pre-clinical data to fully characterise the effects of THC inhalation on feeding patterns and is the first to directly examine how THC alters macronutrient-specific food preferences and assess if appetitive THC-driven sex differences exist. This research sheds light on whether cannabis use can have energy-balance effects, information which is beneficial for recreational and medical cannabis users.",

However, chronic inflammation and excessive fibrosis resulting from its degradation remain significant obstacles to extended clinical use. Immune cell activation has been correlated to the acidity of breakdown products, yet methods to neutralize the pH have not significantly reduced adverse responses. Using a bioenergetic model, we observed delayed cellular changes that were not apparent in the short-term. Amorphous and semi-crystalline PLA degradation products, including monomeric L-lactic acid, mechanistically remodel metabolism in cells leading to a reactive immune microenvironment characterized by elevated proinflammatory cytokines. Selective inhibition of metabolic reprogramming and altered bioenergetics both reduce these undesirable high cytokine levels and stimulate anti-inflammatory signals. Our results present a new biocompatibility paradigm by identifying metabolism as a target for immunomodulation to increase tolerance to biomaterials, ensuring safe clinical application of PLA-based implants for soft- and hard-tissue regeneration, and advancing nanomedicine and drug delivery.",

In addition to conventional single-cell RNA-seq, hdWGCNA is capable of performing isoform-level network analysis using long-read single-cell data. We showcase hdWGCNA using publicly available single-cell datasets from Autism spectrum disorder and Alzheimers disease brain samples, identifying disease-relevant co-expression network modules in specific cell populations. hdWGCNA is directly compatible with Seurat, a widely-used R package for single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analysis, and we demonstrate the scalability of hdWGCNA by analyzing a dataset containing nearly one million cells.",

    "abstract": "Effects from aging in single cells are unpredictable, whereas aging phenotypes at the organ- and tissue-levels tend to appear as stereotypical changes. The mammary epithelium is a bilayer of two major phenotypically and functionally distinct cell lineages, the luminal epithelial and myoepithelial cells. Mammary epithelia exhibit substantial stereotypical changes with age that merits attention because they are putative breast cancer-cells-of-origin. We hypothesize that effects from aging that impinge upon maintenance of lineage fidelity increases susceptibility to cancer initiation. We identified two models of age-dependent changes in gene expression, directional changes and increased variance, which contributed to genome-wide loss of lineage fidelity. Age-dependent variant responses were common to both lineages, whereas directional changes were almost exclusively detected in luminal epithelia and implicated downregulation of chromatin and genome organizers such as SATB1. Epithelial expression of gap junction protein GJB6 increased with age, and modulation of GJB6 expression in heterochronous co-cultures revealed that it provided a communication conduit from myoepithelial cells that drove directional change in luminal cells. Age-dependent luminal transcriptomes comprised a prominent signal detectable in bulk tissue during aging and transition into cancers. A machine learning classifier based on luminal-specific aging distinguished normal from cancer tissue and was predictive of breast cancer subtype. We speculate that luminal epithelia are the ultimate site of integration of the variant responses to aging in their surrounding tissue and that their emergent aging phenotype both endows cells with the ability to become cancer-cells-of-origin and embodies a biosensor that presages cancer susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Acute exercise increases liver gluconeogenesis to supply glucose to working muscle. Concurrently, elevated liver lipid breakdown fuels the high energetic cost of gluconeogenesis. This functional coupling between liver gluconeogenesis and lipid oxidation has been proposed to underlie the ability of regular exercise to enhance liver mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and decrease liver steatosis in individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Herein we tested whether repeated bouts of increased hepatic gluconeogenesis are necessary for exercise training to lower liver lipids. Experiments used diet-induced obese mice lacking hepatic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (KO) to inhibit gluconeogenesis and wild type (WT) littermates. 2H/13C metabolic flux analysis quantified glucose and mitochondrial oxidative fluxes in untrained mice at rest and during acute exercise. Circulating and tissue metabolite levels were determined during sedentary conditions, acute exercise, and refeeding post-exercise. Mice also underwent six weeks of treadmill running protocols to define hepatic and extrahepatic adaptations to exercise training. Untrained KO mice were unable to maintain euglycemia during acute exercise resulting from an inability to increase gluconeogenesis. Liver triacylglycerides were elevated following acute exercise and circulating {beta}-hydroxybutyrate was higher during post-exercise refeeding in untrained KO mice. In contrast, exercise training prevented liver triacylglyceride accumulation in KO mice. This was accompanied by pronounced increases in indices of skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative metabolism in KO mice. Together, these results show that hepatic gluconeogenesis is dispensable for exercise training to reduce liver lipids. This may be due to responses in ketone body metabolism and/or metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle to exercise.",

    "abstract": "To embrace big-data neuroimaging, harmonization of site effect in resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data fusion is a fundamental challenge. Comprehensive evaluation of potentially effective harmonization strategies, particularly with specifically collected data has been rare, especially for R-fMRI metrics. Here, we comprehensively assess harmonization strategies from multiple perspectives, including efficiency, individual identification, test-retest reliability and replicability of group-level statistical results, on widely used R-fMRI metrics across multiple datasets including data obtained from the same participants scanned at several sites. For individual identifiability (i.e., whether the same subject could be identified across R-fMRI data scanned across different sites), we found that, while most methods decreased site effects, the Subsampling Maximum-mean-distance based distribution shift correction Algorithm (SMA) outperformed linear regression models, linear mixed models, ComBat series and invariant conditional variational auto-encoder. Test-retest reliability was better for SMA and adjusted ComBat series than alternatives, while SMA was superior to the latter in replicability, both in terms of Dice coefficient and the scale of brain areas showing sex differences reproducibly observed across datasets. Moreover, we examined test-retest datasets to identify the best target site features to optimize SMA identifiability and test-retest reliability. We noted that both sample size and distribution of the target site matter and introduced a heuristic target site selection formula. In addition to providing practical guidelines, this work can inform continuing improvements and innovations in harmonizing methodologies for big R-fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxic ischaemic injury (HIE) in the neonatal brain has significant consequences on neurodevelopment and increases the occurrence of neurological deficits in infants. HIE is also a leading cause of neonatal seizures. Therapeutic options for the treatment of HIE are very limited. Hypoxia-ischemia directly damages brain tissue in a primary-wave of injury which activates a cascade of events triggering local and systemic inflammatory responses, driven by the innate immune system, which contribute to a significant secondary-wave of injury taking place as early as 6 hours post-hypoxia-ischaemia. Levels of the well documented inflammatory microRNA, miR-155 are elevated in rodent seizure and epilepsy models. Here, we assessed the impact of, miR-155 deletion in myeloid cells, on regulating inflammation and seizure severity in a preclinical model of neonatal hypoxia-induced seizures (Hypoxia-Sz). Wildtype miR-155 (miR-155+/+LysMCre) mice were compared to a mouse line in which miR-155 was deleted in myeloid cells (miR-155fl/fl LysMCre). We demonstrate significant upregulation of miR-155 target genes, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), arginase-2 (arg-2), ship-1 and socs-1 in miR-155fl/fl LysMCre mice compared to controls at various time points following Hypoxia-Sz. Conversely, we report decreased mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1{beta} and IL-6 and lower protein levels of IL-1{beta} in miR-155fl/fl LysMCre mice as compared to WTs. Myeloid miR-155 deletion significantly reduced behavioural seizure severity score, reduced electrographically (EEG) measured seizure frequency and seizure burden as compared to mice to wildtypes, suggesting miR-155 regulation of seizure occurrence in this model. Behavioural tests for motor functions at 5 weeks post Hypoxia-Sz demonstrated differences between genotypes. Excitingly this work highlights that inhibition of miR-155, specifically in myeloid cells, may hold therapeutic benefit for both seizures and comorbidities associated with hypoxic brain injury.",

The resulting data are richly varied at every level, enabling analyses that can probe everything from spectral representations to high-level representations of semantic meaning. We provide a dataset containing BOLD fMRI responses recorded while 8 subjects each listened to 27 complete, natural, narrative stories (~6 hours).

To address the challenges of analyzing naturalistic data, this dataset is accompanied by a python library containing basic code for creating voxelwise encoding models.

    "abstract": "Tau aggregates are a hallmark of multiple neurodegenerative diseases and can contain RNAs and RNA binding proteins, including SRRM2 and PNN. How these resident nuclear proteins mislocalize and their influence on the prion-like propagation of tau fibers remains unknown. We demonstrate that polyserine repeats in SRRM2 and PNN are necessary and sufficient for recruitment to tau aggregates. Moreover, we demonstrate tau fibers preferentially grow in association with endogenous cytoplasmic assemblies - mitotic interchromatin granules and cytoplasmic speckles - which contain SRRM2 and PNN. Polyserine undergoes self-assembly in vitro and in cells, where polyserine-assemblies are sites of tau fiber propagation. Modulating the levels of polyserine containing proteins results in a corresponding change in tau aggregation. These findings define a specific protein motif, and cellular condensates, that promote tau fiber propagation. As cytoplasmic speckles form in iPSC neurons under inflammatory or hyperosmolar stress, they may promote tau fiber propagation in various neurodegenerative diseases.",

    "abstract": "The impact of endemic parasitic infection on vaccine efficacy is an important consideration for vaccine development and deployment. We have examined whether intestinal infection with the natural murine helminth Heligmosomoides polygyrus bakeri alters antigen-specific antibody and cellular immune responses to oral and parenteral vaccination in mice. We found that oral vaccination of mice with a clinically relevant, live, attenuated, recombinant Salmonella vaccine that expresses chicken egg ovalbumin (Salmonella-OVA) disrupts ovalbumin-specific regulatory T cell networks in the gut associated lymphoid tissue and promotes T-effector responses to OVA. Chronic intestinal helminth infection significantly reduced Th1-skewed antibody responses to oral vaccination with Salmonella-OVA. Activated, adoptively-transferred, OVA-specific CD4+ T cells accumulated in draining mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of vaccinated mice, irrespective of their helminth-infection status. However, helminth infection increased the frequencies of adoptively-transferred OVA-specific CD4+ T cells producing IL-4 and IL-10 in the MLN. Chronic intestinal helminth infection also significantly reduced Th2-skewed antibody responses to parenteral vaccination with OVA adsorbed to alum. These findings suggest helminth-induced impairment of vaccine antibody responses may be driven by the development of IL-10-secreting CD4+ T regulatory cells. They also underscore the potential need to treat parasitic infection before mass vaccination campaigns in helminth-endemic areas.",

    "abstract": "The corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH)-expressing neurons in the hypothalamus are critical regulators of the neuroendocrine stress response pathway, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. As developmental vulnerabilities of CRH neurons contribute to stress-associated neurological and behavioral dysfunctions, it is critical to identify the mechanisms underlying normal and abnormal CRH neuron development. Using zebrafish, we identified Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule like-1 (dscaml1) as an integral mediator of CRH neuron development and necessary for establishing normal stress axis function. In dscaml1 mutant animals, hypothalamic CRH neurons had higher crhb (the CRH homolog in fish) expression, increased cell number, and reduced cell death compared to wild-type controls. Physiologically, dscaml1 mutant animals had higher baseline stress hormone (cortisol) levels and attenuated responses to acute stressors. Together, these findings identify dscaml1 as an essential factor for stress axis development and suggest that HPA axis dysregulation may contribute to the etiology of human DSCAML1 -linked neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Human presence and habitat disturbance (together  human pressure hereafter) can generate a deep fear in animals and this can influence their behaviour. Altered animal behaviour, such as shifts in diel activity patterns, affect many species and species interactions, which can induce changes in individual fitness, species-level population persistence, evolutionary dynamics, and ecosystem-level biodiversity. However, whether dial activity behavioural responses to human pressure are consistent among key functional groups has been poorly studied. For example, while medium to large mammal species tend to become more nocturnal in areas with high human pressure, its unclear if sympatric/co-occurring birds display similar or opposite patterns. This is an important knowledge gap because synchronous or opposing guild-level shifts can shape consequences for food-web dynamics (predation and competition), stability of interaction networks and ecosystem functioning. Here we used information from camera trapping along a gradient of human pressure in the Colombian Llanos region to assess diel activity changes in birds and mammals. We found that the diel activity of over 45% of the bird and 50% of the mammals assessed significantly changed where there was higher human pressures, with mammals becoming more nocturnal and birds more diurnal. The opposing behavioural responses to humans among vertebrate functional groups has significant repercussions for the fields of community ecology, including intraguild predation and competition, and may be a significant ecosystem-level conservation consideration.",

Together with algae, copepod, protist and bacteria diversity and abundance data in combination with physico-chemical data and antibody-based saccharide measurements, we demonstrate (i) how dissolved primary photoassimilated algal and secondary bacterial storage glycans shape the bacterioplankton community composition, and (ii) how grazing on higher trophic levels determines the release of these abundant glycans. We thus elucidate principles governing how bacterioplankton clades respond to algal blooms and collectively remineralize gigatons of carbon annually on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Human activities generate negative environmental impacts that can compromise ecological processes and ecosystem services and thus, influence human health. We assessed how natural and altered areas affect human respiratory and mental health in one of the largest mining provinces in the world, the Quadrilatero Ferrifero (QF), in southeastern Brazil. We used a model selection approach to evaluate socioeconomic and environmental factors that would influence hospitalization rates for mental and behavioral disorders, as well as for respiratory diseases in 22 municipalities in QF. Municipalities with higher rates of urbanization had higher rates of hospitalizations for mental and behavioral disorders. Conversely, the adult population (15-59 years old) of both gender and the elderly female population (60 years old or more) presented lower rates of hospitalization for respiratory diseases in municipalities with a higher rate of urbanization, suggesting a greater ease of access to prophylactic measures of the population located in these municipalities compared to those with a lower rate of urbanization. Municipalities with larger urban forest areas had lower rates of hospitalization for respiratory diseases in the young (0-14 years) female population, while municipalities with larger mining areas had higher rates. The elderly male population (60 years or older) also had higher rates of hospitalization for respiratory diseases in municipalities with larger mining areas.

    "abstract": "Genes and languages both contain signatures of human history. Genetics and culture have each been shown to track population movements and demographic history. Complicating this picture, cultural traits may themselves influence the ways in which people interact with one another. For example, cultural differences can produce barriers to gene flow if they cause groups of people to differentiate themselves from one another. However, the degree of cultural difference necessary and the magnitude of these effects on gene flow remain unknown. In particular, language differences may limit population mixing, and we focus on whether subtle, dialect-level linguistic differences have influenced genetic population structure, likely by affecting mating preferences. Here, we analyze spatially dense linguistic and genetic data to examine whether the intensity of differences between and within dialects in England are associated with high genetic rates of change. We find that genetic variation and dialect markers have similar spatial distributions on a country-wide scale, and become less distinct as the scale of smaller administrative units such as counties. This covariation, combined with the absence of geographic barriers that could coordinate cultural and genetic differentiation, suggests that some dialect-level linguistic boundaries have influenced the genetic population structure in England.",

Mediator is an essential and conserved coactivator thought to act in concert with chromatin regulators. However, it remains largely unknown how their functions are coordinated. Here, we provide evidence in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that Mediator establishes physical contact with RSC (Remodels the Structure of Chromatin), a conserved and essential chromatin remodeling complex that is crucial for nucleosome-depleted region (NDR) formation. We determined the role of Mediator-RSC interaction in their recruitment, nucleosome occupancy and transcription on a genomic scale. Mediator and RSC co-localize on wide NDRs of promoter regions, and specific Mediator mutations affect nucleosome eviction and TSS-associated +1 nucleosome stability. This work shows that Mediator contributes to RSC remodeling function to shape NDRs and maintain chromatin organization on promoter regions. It will help in our understanding of transcriptional regulation in the chromatin context relevant for severe diseases.",

Although only a narrow fraction of plant or animal proteins induce allergy, atopic disorders affect millions of children and adults and cost billions in healthcare systems worldwide. In-silico predictors can aid in the development of more innocuous food sources. Previous allergenicity predictors used sequence similarity, common structural domains, and amino acid physicochemical features. However, these predictors strongly rely on sequence similarity to known allergens and fail to predict protein allergenicity accurately when similarity diminishes. In addition,  allergen is a broad terminology that may include different compounds, hindering the classification task. To overcome these limitations, we collected allergens from AllergenOnline, a curated database of IgE-inducing allergens, carefully removed allergen redundancy with a novel protein partitioning pipeline, and developed a new allergen prediction method, introducing MHC presentation propensity as a novel feature. NetAllergen outperformed a sequence similarity-based BLAST baseline approach, and previous allergenicity predictor AlgPred 2 when similarity to known allergens is limited. NetAllergen is available as a web service (services.healthtech.dtu.dk/service.php?NetAllergen-1.0) and can predict allergenicity from a protein sequence.",

    "abstract": "The recent breakthroughs in structure prediction, where methods such as AlphaFold demonstrated near atomic accuracy, herald a paradigm shift in structure biology. The 200 million high-accuracy models released in the AlphaFold Database are expected to guide protein science in the coming decades. Partitioning these AlphaFold models into domains and subsequently assigning them to our evolutionary hierarchy provides an efficient way to gain functional insights of proteins. However, classifying such a large number of predicted structures challenges the infrastructure of current structure classifications, including our Evolutionary Classification of protein Domains (ECOD). Better computational tools are urgently needed to automatically parse and classify domains from AlphaFold models. Here we present a Domain Parser for AlphaFold Models (DPAM) that can automatically recognize globular domains from these models based on predicted aligned errors, inter-residue distances in 3D structures, and ECOD domains found by sequence (HHsuite) and structural (DALI) similarity searches. Based on a benchmark of 18,759 AlphaFold models, we demonstrated that DPAM could recognize 99.5% domains and assign correct boundaries for 85.2% of them, significantly outperforming structure-based domain parsers and homology-based domain assignment using ECOD domains found by HHsuite or DALI. Application of DPAM to the massive set of AlphaFold models will allow for more efficient classification of domains, providing evolutionary contexts and facilitating functional studies.",

However, key features of the cardiac-specific actin-myosin interaction remain uncertain, including the structural effect of ADP release from myosin, which is ratelimiting during force generation. In fact, ADP release slows under experimental load or in the intact heart due to the afterload, thereby adjusting cardiac muscle power output to meet physiological demands. To further elucidate the structural basis of this fundamental process, we used a combination of cryo-EM reconstruction methodologies to determine structures of the human cardiac actin-myosin-tropomyosin filament complex at better than 3.4 [A]-resolution in the presence and in the absence of Mg2+{middle dot}ADP. Focused refinements of the myosin motor head and its essential light chains in these reconstructions reveal that small changes in the active site are coupled to significant rigid body movements of the myosin converter domain and a 16-degree lever arm swing. Our structures provide a mechanistic framework to understand the effect of ADP binding and release on human cardiac {beta}-myosin and offer insights into the force-sensing mechanism displayed by the cardiac myosin motor.\n\nShort SummaryCryo-EM was used to elucidate high-resolution structures of actin-tropomyosin filaments decorated with human cardiac myosin in the rigor and ADP-bound states.

    "abstract": "DNA supercoiling - the level of twisting and writhing of the DNA molecule around itself - plays a major role in the regulation of gene expression in bacteria by modulating promoter activity. The level of DNA supercoiling is a dynamic property of the chromosome, which varies both at the global scale in response to external factors such as environmental perturbations, and at the local scale in response to internal factors including gene transcription itself. These local variations can couple the transcription rates of neighboring genes by creating feedback loops. The importance of the role of such supercoiling-mediated interactions in the regulation of gene expression however remains uncertain. In this work, we study how this coupling could play a part in the bacterial regulatory landscape by coevolving with genome organization. We present a model of gene transcription and DNA supercoiling at the whole-genome scale, in which individuals must evolve gene expression levels adapted to two different environments. In this model, we observe the evolution of whole-genome regulatory networks that provide fine control over gene expression by leveraging the transcription-supercoiling coupling, and show that the structure of these networks is underpinned by the organization of genes along the chromosome at several scales. Local variations in DNA supercoiling could therefore jointly help shape both gene regulation and genome organization during evolution.",

By overexpressing and silencing HE4 gene in neonatal rat primary alveolar type II epithelial cells, we found that HE4 protein activates the phosphorylation of ERK and p65, activates the downstream MMP9 signaling pathway, inhibits MMP9 mRNA expression, inhibits protein activity, and reduces COLI degradation, increases collagen secretion, promoting matrix remodeling and fibrosis.\n\nConclusionHE4 mediates the pathophysiological process of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in rats through ERK, MMP9 and TIMP1 signaling pathways. HE4 overexpression mediates lung basal remodeling and lung injury.",

    "abstract": "Cortical circuits feature both excitatory and inhibitory cells that underlie the encoding of dynamic sensory stimuli, e.g., speech, music, odors, and natural scenes. While previous studies have shown that inhibition plays an important role in shaping the neural code, little is known about how excitatory and inhibitory cells coordinate to enhance encoding of temporally dynamic stimuli. Recent experimental recordings in mouse auditory cortex (ACx) have shown that optogenetic suppression of parvalbumin (PV) neurons results in a decrease of neural discriminability between dynamic stimuli with speech envelope modulations. Here, we present a multilayer model of a cortical circuit that mechanistically explains these results. The model incorporates characteristic short-term synaptic plasticity (STP) profiles of excitatory and PV cells. Crucially, the model performance is based on populations of PV cells that separately respond to stimulus onsets and offsets. We reveal that by tuning the relative strengths of inhibition from onset- and offset-responding PV cells, the cortical network model captures the broad range of neural discriminability profiles in cortical single-unit data, with varying contributions from rapid firing rate modulations and spike timing. The model also replicates and explains the experimentally observed reduction in neural discrimination performance during optogenetic suppression of PV neurons. These results suggest that distinct populations of PV neurons enhance cortical discriminability of dynamic stimuli by encoding distinct temporal features, enhancing temporal coding, and reducing cortical noise.",

    "abstract": "Traditional approaches to EEG modelling use the methods of classical physics to reconstruct scalp potentials in terms of explicit physical models of cortical neuron ensembles. The principal difficulty is that the multiplicity of cellular processes with an intricate array of deterministic and random factors prevents creation of consistent biophysical parameter sets. An original, empirically-testable solution has been recently achieved in our previous studies by a radical departure from the deterministic equations of classical physics to the probabilistic reasoning of quantum mechanics. This crucial step relocates elementary bioelectric sources of EEG signals from the cellular to the molecular level where positively and negatively ions are considered as elementary sources of electricity. The rationale is that despite dramatic differences in cellular machineries, statistical factors governed by the rules of central limit theorem produce EEG waveforms as a statistical aggregate of the synchronized activity of multiple closely-located microscale sources. Using the formalism of nonhomogeneous birth-and-death processes (BDP) the quantum models of microscale events are deduced and linked to the dynamics of macroscale EEG waveforms. This study expands these methods with new features for comprehensive analysis of event related potentials directly from single trials, i.e. the EEG segments which are closely related in timing to cognitive events. We derive a universal model of the components of single trial ERPs both in frequency and time domains. This, for the first time, enables us to quantify all significant cognitive components in single trial ERPs, providing an alternative to the traditional method of averaging. Given P300 as an important objective marker of psychiatric disorders, a methodology which reliably discloses the component compositions of this potential, may have specific diagnostic importance. In this study, reliable identification of the P3a and P3b components from an auditory oddball paradigm provided a means of differentiating borderline personality disorder from schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Post-insemination molecular interactions involving sperm are an ideal system for linking genotype, phenotype, and fitness. Nematode sperm contain subcellular vesicles known as membranous organelles (MOs) that fuse with the cell membrane upon sperm activation to release their soluble contents into the extracellular space. The second most abundant proteins in the MOs is the conserved Nematode-Specific Peptide family, group F (NSPF) gene family.\n\nWe hypothesize that these proteins contribute to seminal fluid upon MO fusion and are part of post-insemination reproductive tract dynamics. We used experimental evolution to compete the wildtype allele against a deletion allele in 10 replicate populations. We calculated a significant mean selective disadvantage of 0.1% for the deletion allele, which indicated that the NSPF genes are an evolutionarily important component of male reproductive success. This conclusion was reinforced by qualitative trends from lower powered single-generation male fertility assays. We then characterized the functional location of NSPF proteins during fertilization using whole-worm immunostaining of a His-tagged nspf-1 transgene. Throughout male development, we found that NSPF presence and abundance was correlated with reproductive maturity in males, localizing to the seminal vesicle during L4 and to the spicules throughout adulthood. We confirmed that NSPF proteins are transferred to females during mating and hypothesize that proteins adhere to the spicules during transfer. NSPF proteins localize to the vulva and uterus lumen when transferred to mated females and in unmated adult hermaphrodites. These results suggest that the uterine localization of the NSPF proteins is likely a functional property of both male-derived sperm and self-sperm and not simply incidental to the point of transfer during mating. Our study demonstrates that nematodes use a novel mechanism for generating seminal fluid proteins and shows that the highly abundant NSPF proteins likely have a female-beneficial fitness effect.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a widely used eukaryotic model organism and a promising cell factory for industry. However, despite decades of research, the regulation of its metabolism is not yet fully understood, and its complexity represents a major challenge for engineering and optimising biosynthetic routes. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of resource and proteomic allocation data in enhancing models for metabolic processes. However, comprehensive and accurate proteome dynamics data that can be used for such approaches are still very limited. Therefore, we performed a quantitative proteome dynamics study to comprehensively cover the transition from exponential to stationary phase for both aerobically and anaerobically grown yeast cells. The combination of highly controlled reactor experiments, biological replicates and standardised sample preparation procedures ensured reproducibility and accuracy. Additionally, we selected the CEN.PK lineage for our experiments because of its relevance for both fundamental and applied research. Together with the prototrophic, standard haploid strain CEN.PK113-7D, we also investigated an engineered strain with genetic minimisation of the glycolytic pathway, resulting in the quantitative assessment of over 1700 proteins across 54 proteomes. These proteins account for nearly 40% of the overall yeast proteome and approximately 99% of the total protein biomass. The anaerobic cultures showed remarkably less proteome-level changes compared to the aerobic cultures, during transition from the exponential to the stationary phase as a consequence of the lack of the diauxic shift in the absence of oxygen. These results support the notion that anaerobically growing cells lack time and resources to adapt to changes in the environment. This proteome dynamics study constitutes an important step towards better understanding of the impact of glucose exhaustion and oxygen on the complex proteome allocation process in yeast. Finally, the established proteome dynamics data provide a valuable resource for the development of resource allocation models as well as for metabolic engineering efforts.",

The floor plate-crossing commissural axons in mammals, from the spinal cord to the midbrain, are guided by a conserved molecular mechanism relying primarily on Netrin-1/DCC/Robo3 signaling. Up to date, we know very little about the upstream transcriptional program that specify commissural axon laterality, neither do we know if a common mechanism operates in all commissural neurons. Here, we identified a pair of highly related helix-loop-helix transcription factors, Nhlh1 and Nhlh2, as a global transcriptional mechanism that controls the laterality of all floor plate-crossing commissural axons. Forced expression of Nhlh1/2 induce ectopic Robo3 expression and contralateral axon projections. And mutant mice deficient in both genes show a remarkable reduction in Robo3 expression and a total lack of ventral commissures from the spinal cord to the midbrain. This global mechanism may interact with neuron type specific mechanism to achieve specific generation of commissural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Cell adhesion molecule 4 (Cadm4) plays important roles on plasma membrane (PM) to regulate myelin formation and the downregulation of Cadm4 is a prominent feature in many demyelination diseases. However, how Cadm4 maintains its level on PM has been elusive. Here, we identify that Cadm4 is palmitoylated at cysteine-347 (C347) and palmitoylation regulates the stable localization of Cadm4 on PM, as blocking palmitoylation by mutating C347 into alanine (C347A) results in the dissociation of Cadm4 from PM and targeting for degradation. Intriguingly, blocking Cadm4 palmitoylation by introducing C347A (Cadm4-KI) causes myelin abnormalities in CNS, characterized by loss of myelination, myelin infoldings and hypermyelination. Moreover, it is uncovered that Cadm4 palmitoylation is catalyzed by DHHC3, reducing Cadm4 palmitoylation by the deletion of DHHC3 renders the redistribution of Cadm4 for degrading. Consistently, the genetic deletion of DHHC3 leads to downregulated Cadm4 palmitoylation and defects in CNS myelination, virtually phenocopies that of the Cadm4-KI mice. Our findings suggest a mechanism that the stable localization of Cadm4 on PM regulated by protein palmitoylation is vital for myelination in CNS.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe human visual cortex processes visual stimuli hierarchically. Early visual areas (V1, V2) of the ventral visual stream feed crude visual features (like orientation and edges) into later visual areas (V4, lateral occipital (Lat Occ), inferior temporal (IT)) that then encode complex visual features (like object form). Previous studies have reported a difference in fMRI responses between natural and urban landscapes in certain parts of the brain. Here we asked if this distinction in the representation of complex natural and man-made visual stimuli extends to the ventral visual stream and if state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks (CNN) provide a map to this categorical distinction. To assess this, we used an open source fMRI data set of V1-4 and LatOcc BOLD responses to 1750 passively viewed natural and man-made grayscale images. The same images were fed into the pre-trained CORnet-S, a CNN designed to model hierarchical human visual processing layer-wise. To identify differences in representations within and between the human visual cortex and the CNN, we computed representational dissimilarity matrices. The BOLD response to the manmade and natural images shows correlation differences for the two categories, which increase across V4 and LatOcc. Such differences were also observed in the model CORnet-S for the layers V4 and IT. Our results suggest that the human visual cortex processes natural and manmade images differently starting from V4 and that this representational difference is modeled in CORnet-S. In both, categorical representation is progressively established in the later processing stages. This might indicate that the brain has perhaps developed two-distinct systems for their representations which can be directed through evolution. Further analysis may elucidate the contributory role of evolution towards this paradigm.",

The interaction between parasites, adipose tissue, and the local immune system is likely to drive the adipose tissue wasting and weight loss observed in cattle and humans infected with T. brucei. However, mechanistically, the events leading to scWAT wasting are not fully understood. Here, using several complementary approaches, including mass cytometry by time of flight, bulk and single cell transcriptomics, and in vivo genetic models, we found that T. brucei infection drives local expansion of several IL-17A-producing cells in the murine WAT, including TH17 and V{gamma}6+ T cells. We also found that global IL-17 deficiency, or mice lacking IL-17 receptor expression exclusively in adipocytes, were protected from infection-induced WAT wasting and weight loss. Unexpectedly, we found that abrogation of IL-17 signalling in adipocytes results in a significant accumulation of Dpp4+ Pi16+ interstitial preadipocytes and a higher burden of extravascular parasites in the WAT, highlighting a critical role for IL-17 signalling in controlling preadipocyte fate, scWAT tissue dynamics, and local parasite burden. Taken together, our study highlights the central role of adipocyte IL-17 signalling in controlling WAT responses to infection, suggesting that adipocytes are a critical coordinator of the tissue dynamics and immune responses to T. brucei infection.",

    "abstract": "Marine sponges are critical components of marine benthic fauna assemblages where their filter-feeding and reef-building capabilities provide bentho-pelagic coupling and crucial habitat. As potentially the oldest representation of a metazoan-microbe symbiosis, they also harbor dense, diverse, and species-specific communities of microbes, which are increasingly recognized for their contributions to dissolved organic matter (DOM) processing. Recent omics-based studies of marine sponge microbiomes have proposed numerous pathways of dissolved metabolite exchange between the host and symbionts within the context of the surrounding environment, but few studies have sought to experimentally interrogate these pathways. By using a combination of metaproteogenomics and laboratory incubations coupled with isotope-based functional assays, we showed that the dominant gammaproteobacterial symbiont  Candidatus Taurinisymbion ianthellae residing in the marine sponge, Ianthella basta, expresses a pathway for the import and dissimilation of taurine, a ubiquitously occurring sulfonate metabolite in marine sponges.  Candidatus Taurinisymbion ianthellae incorporates taurine-derived carbon and nitrogen while, at the same time, oxidizing the dissimilated sulfite into sulfate for export. Furthermore, we found that taurine-derived ammonia is exported by the symbiont for immediate oxidation by the dominant ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeal symbiont  Candidatus Nitrosospongia ianthellae. Metaproteogenomic analyses also indicate that  Candidatus Taurinisymbion ianthellae likely imports DMSP and possesses both pathways for DMSP demethylation and cleavage, enabling it to use this compound as a carbon and sulfur source for biomass, as well as for energy conservation. These results highlight the important role of biogenic sulfur compounds in the interplay between Ianthella basta and its microbial symbionts.",

    "abstract": "LexA, a well-characterized transcriptional repressor of the SOS genes in heterotrophic bacteria, has been shown to regulate diverse genes in cyanobacteria. An earlier study showed that LexA overexpression in a cyanobacterium, Anabaena sp. PCC7120 reduces its tolerance to Cd stress. This was later shown to be due to modulation of photosynthetic redox poising by LexA under Cd stress. However, in light of the global regulatory nature of LexA and the prior prediction of AnLexA-box in a few heavy metal-responsive genes, we speculated that LexA has a broad role in Cd stress tolerance, with regulation over a variety of Cd stress-responsive genes in addition to the regulation on genes related with photosynthetic redox poising. Thus, to further expand the knowledge on the regulatory role of LexA in Cd stress tolerance, a cytosolic proteome profiling of Anabaena constitutively overexpressing LexA upon Cd stress was performed. The proteomic study revealed 25 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) in response to the combined effect of LexA overexpression and Cd stress, and the other 11 DAPs exclusively in response to either LexA overexpression or Cd stress. The 36 identified proteins were related with a variety of functions, including photosynthesis, carbon metabolism, antioxidative defence, protein turnover, chaperones, post-transcriptional modifications, and a few unknown and hypothetical proteins. The regulation of LexA on corresponding genes, as well as six previously reported Cd efflux transporters, was further validated by the presence of AnLexA-boxes, transcript, and/or promoter analyses. In a nutshell, this study identifies the regulation of LexA on several genes and proteins of various functional categories in Anabaena that are responsive to Cd stress, hence expanding the regulatory role of LexA under Cd stress.\n\nHighlightsO_LILexA overexpression was earlier shown to decrease Cd stress tolerance in Anabaena.\nC_LIO_LIWe examined the combined effect of LexA overexpression and Cd on Anabaena proteome.\nC_LIO_LIUpon LexA overexpression or Cd stress or both, 36 differential proteins were found.\nC_LIO_LIIn silico, transcript and EMSA proved LexA regulation on them and few transporters.\nC_LIO_LIThe findings of this study extended the regulatory role of LexA in Cd tolerance.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The cellular environment is critical for efficient protein maturation, but how proteins fold during biogenesis remains poorly understood. We used hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) mass spectrometry (MS) to define, at peptide resolution, the cotranslational chaperone-assisted folding pathway of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. On the ribosome, the nascent polypeptide folds via structured intermediates not populated during refolding from denaturant. Association with the ribosome allows these intermediates to form, as otherwise destabilizing C-terminal sequences remain confined in the ribosome exit tunnel. We find that partially-folded nascent chains recruit the chaperone Trigger factor, which uses a large composite hydrophobic/hydrophilic interface to engage folding intermediates without disrupting their structure. In addition, we comprehensively mapped dynamic interactions between the nascent chain and ribosomal proteins, tracing the path of the emerging polypeptide during synthesis. Our work provides a high-resolution description of de novo protein folding dynamics, thereby revealing new mechanisms by which cellular factors shape the conformational search for the native state.",

    "abstract": "Reactive carbonyl species (RCS) such as methylglyoxal and glyoxal are potent glycolytic intermediates that extensively damage cellular biomolecules leading to genetic aberration and protein misfolding. Hence, RCS levels are crucial indicators in the progression of various pathological diseases. Besides the glyoxalase system, emerging studies report highly conserved DJ-1/ThiJ/PfpI superfamily proteins as critical regulators of RCS. DJ-1 superfamily proteins, including the human DJ-1, a genetic determinant of Parkinsons disease possess diverse physiological functions paramount for combating multiple stressors. Although S. cerevisiae retains four DJ-1 orthologs (namely Hsp31, Hsp32, Hsp33, and Hsp34), their physiological relevance and collective requirement are still obscure due to their close sequence similarity. Here, we report for the first time that the yeast DJ-1 orthologs function as novel enzymes involved in the preferential scavenge of glyoxal and methylglyoxal, toxic metabolites, and genotoxic agents. At the cellular level, their collective loss induces chronic glycation of the proteome, and nucleic acids, resulting in a spectrum of genetic mutations and reduced mRNA translational efficiency. Furthermore, the Hsp31 paralogs efficiently repair severely glycated macromolecules derived from carbonyl modifications. They also participate in genome maintenance as their absence upregulates DNA damage response pathways when exposed to different genotoxins. Interestingly, yeast DJ-1 orthologs provide robust organellar protection by redistributing into mitochondria to alleviate the glycation damage of mitochondrial DNA and proteins. Taken together, our study uncovers the existence of a novel glycation repair pathway in S. cerevisiae and a possible neuroprotective mechanism of how hDJ-1 confers mitochondrial health during carbonyl stress.",

    "abstract": "Triterpenoids possess potent biological activities, but their polycyclic skeletons are challenging to synthesise. In biochemistry, the skeletal diversity of plant triterpenoids is normally generated by oxidosqualene cyclases and remains unaltered during subsequent tailoring steps. In contrast, we report here enzyme-mediated skeletal rearrangements after the initial cyclisation, controlling the pathway bifurcation between different plant triterpenoid classes. Using a combination of bioinformatics, heterologous expression in plants and chemical analyses, we identified a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and two isomerases for this process. The two isomerases share one epoxide substrate but generate two different rearrangement products, one containing a cyclopropane ring. Our findings reveal a new strategy how triterpenoid skeletal diversity is generated in Nature and are crucial for the biotechnological production of limonoid, quassinoid, isoprotolimonoid and glabretane triterpenoids.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is the most prevalent protein post-translational modification, with a quarter of glycosylated proteins having enzymatic properties. Yet the full impact of glycosylation on the protein structure-function relationship, especially in enzymes, is still limited. Here we show glycosylation rigidifies the important commercial enzyme horseradish peroxidase (HRP), which in turn increases its activity and stability. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that glycosylation increased holo-HRPs thermal stability and promoted significant helical structure in the absence of haem (apo-HRP). Glycosylation also resulted in a 10-fold increase in enzymatic turnover towards o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride when compared to its non-glycosylated form. Utilising a naturally occurring site-specific probe of active site flexibility (Trp117) in combination with red-edge excitation shift fluorescence spectroscopy, we found that glycosylation significantly rigidified the enzyme. In silico simulations confirmed that glycosylation largely decreased protein backbone flexibility, especially in regions close to the active site and the substrate access channel. Thus, our data shows that glycosylation does not just have a passive effect on HRP stability but can exert long range effects that mediate the  native enzymes activity and stability through changes in inherent dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Only a few proteins (13 in humans) are encoded by the mammalian mitochondrial genome. Therefore, the other mitochondrial resident proteins (>1000) must be recruited via specialised import pathways. Protein import is critical for mitochondrial biogenesis and bioenergetic function and health; loss of function has been implicated with a wide range of pathologies. Despite this, our understanding of the kinetic and dynamics of import is somewhat limited, particularly within mammalian cells. Here, we report an adaptation of an assay system, established previously to monitor mitochondrial import into isolated yeast mitochondria, to quantitatively monitor mitochondrial import inside mammalian cells. The reporting is based on a split luciferase, whereby the large fragment is segregated in the mitochondrial matrix and the small complementary fragment is fused to the C-terminus of a recombinant precursor protein destined for import. Following import successively through the TOM complex of the outer membrane and the TIM23 complex of the inner membrane, the complementary fragments combine to form an active luciferase. The resultant luminescent signal provides a sensitive, accurate, free of noise and continuous measure of protein import, enabling mathematical model fitting to identify and understand the steps that make up import. This advance allows detailed mechanistic examination of the transport process in live cells. In addition, the assay will enable characterisation of the protein import when the machinery is challenged; for example, in situations associated with disease. Moreover, the assay is compatible with high throughput for large data set collection and kinetic modelling, as well as for drug screening and characterisation. Our set-up also has the potential to be adapted for the analysis of alternative transport systems and different cell types, and even for multicellular model organisms.",

While the overall principle is simple, the workflow of ribosome profiling experiments is complex and challenging, and typically requires large amounts of sample, limiting its broad applicability. Here, we present a new protocol for ultra-rapid ribosome profiling from low-input samples. It features a robust strategy for sequencing library preparation within one day that employs solid phase purification of reaction intermediates, allowing to reduce the input to as little as 0.1 pmol of RNA. Hence, it is particularly suited for the analyses of small samples or targeted ribosome profiling. Its high sensitivity and its ease of implementation will foster the generation of higher quality data from small samples, which opens new opportunities in applying ribosome profiling.",

    "abstract": "The phenomenon of phenotypic heterogeneity, where an isogenic population expresses varying phenotypes, has been uncovered for an expanding variety of organisms and traits. This heterogeneity in phenotype can be physiologically relevant, such as the ability for antibiotic persistence to allow populations to survive lethal conditions due to rare cells being in a slow or non-growing state. Recently, it was discovered that Methylorubrum extorquens, a facultative methylotroph, possesses a continuous spectrum of phenotypic states conferring tolerance to formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is a toxin produced by M. extorquens during growth on methanol. The phenotypic tolerance allowed rapid growth on levels of formaldehyde which were lethal to the majority of the population. Transcriptomics indicated this may be due to upregulation of proteins that attenuate oxidative stress and protein damage rather than increasing formaldehyde oxidation to prevent accumulation. These data suggested that heterogeneity to formaldehyde stress may be present even in non-methylotrophic organisms that do not routinely produce large quantities of formaldehyde, and thus widely distributed across bacteria. To investigate this, we tested Escherichia coli for heterogeneity to formaldehyde stress during growth on glucose. Like M. extorquens, E. coli populations have a wide, continuous range of formaldehyde tolerance thresholds and this tolerance was reversible. Several other features, however, were different from what was found for M. extorquens. Most E. coli growth occurred after formaldehyde levels had dropped, suggesting that persistence could be the cause. The dynamics of antibiotic persistence and formaldehyde tolerance were both tracked but found to not be correlated. On the other hand, the persister cell state can maintain formaldehyde tolerance. These data suggest that persistence can preserve phenotypic heterogeneities in other traits, further expanding its potential role in helping cells survive environmental stressors.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic microbes from the genus  Candidatus Megaira (Rickettsiales) are known to be common associates of algae and ciliates. However genomic resources for these bacteria are scarce, limiting our understanding of their diversity and biology. We therefore utilized SRA and metagenomic assemblies to explore the diversity of this genus. We successfully extracted four draft  Ca. Megaira genomes including one complete scaffold for a  Ca. Megaira and identified an additional 14 draft genomes from uncategorised environmental Metagenome-Assembled Genomes. We use this information to resolve the phylogeny for the hyper-diverse  Ca. Megaira, with hosts broadly spanning ciliates, micro- and macro-algae, and find that the current single genus designation  Ca. Megaira significantly underestimates their diversity. We also evaluate the metabolic potential and diversity of  Ca. Megaira from this new genomic data and find no clear evidence of nutritional symbiosis. In contrast, we hypothesize a potential for defensive symbiosis in  Ca. Megaira. Intriguingly, one symbiont genome revealed a proliferation of ORFs with ankyrin, tetratricopeptide and Leucine rich repeats like those observed in the genus Wolbachia where they are considered important for host-symbiont protein-protein interactions. Onward research should investigate the phenotypic interactions between  Ca. Megaira and their various potential hosts, including the economically important Nemacystus decipiens, and target acquisition of genomic information to reflect the diversity of this massively variable group.\n\nData SummaryGenomes assembled in this project have been deposited in bioproject PRJNA867165\n\nImpact statementBacteria that live inside larger organisms commonly form symbiotic relationships that impact the hosts biology in fundamental ways, such as improving defences against natural enemies or altering host reproduction. Certain groups like ciliates and algae are known to host symbiotic bacteria commonly, but our knowledge of their symbionts evolution and function is limited. One such bacteria is  Candidatus Megaira, a Rickettsiales that was first identified in ciliates, then later in algae. To improve the available data for this common but understudied group, we searched the genomes of potential hosts on online databases for Rickettsiales and assembled their genomes. We found 4  Ca. Megaira this way and then used these to find a further 14 genomes in environmental metagenomic data. Overall, we increased the number of known  Ca. Megaira draft genomes from 2 to 20. These new genomes show us that  Ca. Megaira is far more diverse than previously thought and that it is potentially involved in defensive symbioses. In addition, one genome shows striking resemblance to well characterized symbiont, Wolbachia, in encoding many proteins predicted to interact directly with host proteins. The genomes we have identified and examined here provide baseline resources for future work investigating the real-world interactions between the hyper diverse  Ca. Megaira and its various potential hosts, like the economically important Nemacystus decipiens.",

CHP3 binds Ca2+ with micromolar affinity providing the basis to respond to intracellular Ca2+ signals. Ca2+ binding and myristoylation are important for CHP3 function but the underlying molecular mechanism remained elusive. Here, we show that Ca2+ binding and myristoylation independently affect conformational dynamics and functions of human CHP3. Ca2+ binding increased flexibility and hydrophobicity of CHP3 indicative of an open conformation. CHP3 in open Ca2+-bound conformation had higher affinity for NHE1 and associated stronger with lipid membranes compared to the closed Mg2+-bound conformation. Myristoylation enhanced flexibility of CHP3 and decreased its affinity to NHE1 independently of the bound ion, but did not affect its binding to lipid membranes. The data exclude the proposed Ca2+-myristoyl switch for CHP3. Instead, they document a Ca2+-independent exposure of the myristoyl moiety induced by binding of the target peptide to CHP3 enhancing its association to lipid membranes. We name this novel regulatory mechanism \"target-dependent myristoyl switch\". Taken together, the interplay of Ca2+ binding, myristoylation and target binding allows for a context-specific regulation of CHP3 functions.",

    "abstract": "The use of cyanobacteria as bio-factories for production of numerous compounds of interest (biofuels, bioplastics ...) has attracted lots of attention mainly due to their simple nutritional requirements, coupled with the decrease in atmospheric CO2 levels. However, although cyanobacteria are easily genetically manipulated, there are few genetic tools developed and, in some cases, the modifications necessary for metabolic engineering are limited for this reason. We have developed a new positive selection marker based on the arsenic resistance system of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. In this cyanobacterium, resistance to arsenic is mediated by the arsBHC operon in which arsB encodes an arsenite transporter whose mutation confers hypersensitivity to the presence of both arsenite and arsenate. Using arsB mutant strain (SARSB) as recipient we introduced plasmids containing both arsB and an antibiotic resistance gene and transformants were selected using either arsenic or the antibiotic with similar efficiency. The plasmids and conditions to use the arsB gene as a selectable marker have been optimized. Furthermore, we have generated an integrative vector to delete the whole arsBHC operon that allows easy introduction of regulated genes in this locus. Analysis of this strain have shown that the{Delta} arsBHC mutant has a higher sensitivity to arsenite than the SARSB strain, even when they are complemented with an arsB copy. These suggest that arsH, arsC or both could have an additional role in arsenite resistance.",

We investigated whether being exposed to videos with different levels of narrativity modulates shared neural responses, measured by inter-subject correlation, and engagement levels. Thirty-two participants watched video advertisements with high-level and low-level of narrativity while their neural responses were measured through electroencephalogram. Additionally, participants engagement levels were calculated based on the composite of their self-reported attention and immersion scores. Results demonstrated that both calculated inter-subject correlation and engagement scores for high-level video ads were significantly higher than those for low-level, suggesting that narrativity levels modulate inter-subject correlation and engagement. We believe that these findings are a step toward the elucidation of the viewers way of processing and understanding a given communication artifact as a function of the narrative qualities expressed by the level of narrativity.",

We recorded groups of songbirds with multiple cameras and microphones and recorded their body vibrations with custom low-power frequency-modulated (FM) radio transmitters. We developed a custom software-defined radio receiver with a multi-antenna demodulation technique that increased the signal-to-noise ratio of the received radio signals by 6.5 dB and reduced the signal loss rate due to fading by a factor of 63 to only 0.01% of the recording time compared to single-antenna demodulation. Nevertheless, neither a single vibration sensor nor a single microphone is sufficient by itself to detect the complete vocal output of an individual. Even in the minimal setting of an animal pair, an average of about 3.7% of vocalizations remain undetected within each sensor modality. Our work emphasizes the need for high-quality recording systems and for multimodal analysis of social behavior.",
