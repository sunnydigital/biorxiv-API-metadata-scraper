    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is a continuously increasing concern for public health care. Understanding resistance mechanisms and their emergence is crucial for the development of new antibiotics and their effective use. Here, we report the discovery of a gene amplification-based mechanism that imparts an up to 1000-fold increase in resistance levels against the antibiotic albicidin. We show that this mechanism protects Salmonella Typhimurium and Escherichia coli by increasing the copy number of the GyrI-like transcription regulator STM3175 (YgiV) which binds albicidin. X-ray crystallography and molecular docking studies reveal a conserved binding motif that can interact with aromatic building blocks of albicidin. Phylogenetic studies suggest that this resistance mechanism is ubiquitous in Gram-negative bacteria and our experiments confirm that STM3175 homologs can convey resistance in pathogens such as Vibrio vulnificus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "Caveolae are small flask-shaped invaginations of the surface membrane which are proposed to recruit and co-localise signalling molecules. The distinctive caveolar shape is achieved by the oligomeric structural protein caveolin, of which three isoforms exist. Aside from the finding that caveolin-3 is specifically expressed in muscle, functional differences between the caveolin isoforms have not been rigorously investigated. Caveolin-3 is relatively cysteine-rich compared to caveolins 1 and 2, so we investigated its cysteine post-translational modifications. We find that caveolin-3 is palmitoylated at 6 cysteines and becomes glutathiolated following redox stress. We map the caveolin-3 palmitoylation sites to a cluster of cysteines in its C terminal membrane domain, and the glutathiolation site to an N terminal cysteine close to the region of caveolin-3 proposed to engage in protein interactions. Glutathiolation abolishes caveolin-3 interaction with heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunits. Our results indicate that a caveolin-3 oligomer contains up to 66 palmitates, compared to up to 33 for caveolin-1. The additional palmitoylation sites in caveolin-3 therefore provide a mechanistic basis by which caveolae in smooth and striated muscle can possess unique phospholipid and protein cargoes. These unique adaptations of the muscle-specific caveolin isoform have important implications for caveolar assembly and signalling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIncreasing childhood adiposity is a global issue requiring potentially local solutions to ensure it does not continue into adulthood. We systematically identified potentially modifiable targets of adiposity at the onset and end of puberty in Hong Kong the most economically developed major Chinese city.\n\nMethodsWe conducted an environment-wide association study (EWAS) and an epigenome-wide association study of adiposity to systematically assess associations with body mass index (BMI) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) in Hong Kongs population-representative \"Children of 1997\" birth cohort. Univariable linear regression was used to select exposures related to adiposity at ~11.5 years (BMI n[&le;]7,119, WHR n=5,691) and ~17.6 years (n = 3,618) at Bonferroni-corrected significance, and multivariable linear regression to adjust for potential confounders followed by replication (n=308) and CpG by CpG analysis (n=286) at ~23 years. Findings were compared with evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Mendelian randomization (MR) studies.\n\nResultsAt ~11.5 and ~17.6 years the EWAS identified 14 and 37 exposures associated with BMI, as well as seven and 12 associated with WHR respectively. Most exposures had directionally consistent associations at ~23 years. Maternal second-hand smoking, maternal weight, and birth weight were consistently associated with adiposity. Diet (including dairy intake and artificially sweetened beverages), physical activity, snoring, binge eating, and earlier puberty were positively associated with BMI at ~17.6 years, while eating before sleep was inversely associated with BMI at ~17.6 years. Findings for birth weight, dairy intake, binge eating, and possibly earlier puberty are consistent with available evidence from RCTs or MR studies We found 21 CpGs related to BMI and 18 to WHR.\n\nConclusionsThese novel insights into potentially modifiable factors associated with adiposity at the outset and the end of puberty could, if causal, inform future interventions to improve population health in Hong Kong and similar Chinese settings.\n\nFundingThis study was supported by the Health and Medical Research Fund Research Fellowship, Food and Health Bureau, Hong Kong SAR Government (#04180097).

The apo state structure in an inward-facing conformation revealed a disassembled transport site, altered inter-helical interactions, and importantly, a rigid body movement of a 4-transmembrane helix (TM) bundle relative to the other TMs. The computationally generated and biochemically validated outward-facing conformation model revealed a slide of the 4-TM bundle, which carries the transport site(s), by approximately 8 [A] toward the extracellular side against the static TMs which mediate dimerization.

    "abstract": "Dolichyl monophosphates (DolPs) are essential lipids in glycosylation pathways that are highly conserved across almost all domains of life. The availability of DolP is crucial for all glycosylation processes, as these lipids serve as membrane-anchored building blocks that various types of glycosyltransferases use to generate complex post-translational modifications of proteins and lipids. Analysis of DolP species by reverse-phase liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS) has remained challenging due to their very low abundance and wide range of lipophilicities. Until now, a method for the simultaneous qualitative and quantitative assessment of DolP species from biological membranes has been lacking. Here we describe a novel approach based on simple sample preparation, rapid and efficient trimethylsilyl diazomethane (TMSD)-dependent phosphate methylation and RPLC-MS analysis for quantification of DolP species with different isoprene chain lengths. We used this workflow to selectively quantify DolP species from lipid extracts derived of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, HeLa and human skin fibroblasts from steroid 5--reductase 3-congenital disorders of glycosylation (SRD5A3-CDG) patients and healthy controls. Integration of this workflow with global lipidomics analyses will be a powerful tool to further our understanding of the role of DolPs in pathophysiological alterations of metabolic pathways downstream of HMG-CoA reductase, associated with CDGs, hypercholesterolemia, neurodegeneration, and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Ufmylation, a protein modification by Ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein UFM1, plays a crucial role in several cellular processes including DNA damage response, protein translation and ER homeostasis. To date, little is known how the enzymes responsible for this modification coordinate their action. Here we have studied the details of UFL1 (E3) activity, its binding to UFC1 (E2), and its relation to UBA5 (E1), using a combination of structural modeling with Alphafold2, X-ray crystallography, NMR, and in vitro biochemical activity assays. Guided by an Alphafold2 model, we generated an active UFL1 fusion construct that includes its cofactor DDRGK1, and solved the first crystal structure of this critical interaction. This fusion construct also unveiled the importance of the N-terminal helix of UFL1 for its binding to UFC1, which was validated by ITC and NMR experiments. Importantly, the binding site suggested by our structural model of the UFL1-UFC1 interaction reveals a conserved interface, and suggests a competition for binding to UFC1 between UFL1 and UBA5, which we reconfirmed by NMR. Altogether, our study reveals a novel, terminal helix-mediated regulatory mechanism which coordinates the cascade of E1-E2-E3 mediated transfer of UFM1 to its substrate, and provides new leads to target this important modification.\n\nSignificance statementUfmylation is an important post-translational modification, but little is known about the mechanistic details of its machinery, and in particular how the UFM1 E3 ligase (UFL1) binds and functions together with the E2 conjugating enzyme (UFC1). We combined AlphaFold2 modeling, X-ray crystallography, NMR and biochemical experiments to reveal crucial elements that govern UFL1 activity and ufmylation. We discover a crucial role for the UFL1 N-terminal helix in binding to UFC1 and productive ufmylation. This helix competes with the E1 (UBA5) C-terminal helix for binding to UFC1. Altogether, our findings uncover a new, helix-mediated regulatory mechanism in ufmylation.",

    "abstract": "The phage-assisted, active site-directed ligand evolution (PADLE) is a recently developed technique that uses an amber codon-encoded noncanonical amino acid (ncAA) as an anchor to direct phage-displayed peptides to a target for an enhanced ligand identification process. 2-Amino-8-oxodecanoic acid (Aoda) is a ketone-containing ncAA residue in the macrocyclic peptide natural product apicidin that is a pan-inhibitor of Zn2+-dependent histone deacetylases (HDACs). Its ketone serves as an anchoring point to chelate the catalytic zinc ion in HDACs. Using a previously evolved N{varepsilon}-acetyl-lysyl-tRNA synthetase in combination with tRNAPyl, we showed that Aoda was efficiently incorporated into proteins in Escherichia coli by amber suppression. By propagating an amber codon-obligate phagemid library in E. coli encoding Aoda, we generated an Aoda-containing phage-displayed peptide library. Using this library to conduct PADLE against HDAC8 revealed a 7-mer peptide GH8P01F1 with Aoda-flanking amino acid residues that match existing peptide sequences in identified HDAC8 substrates. Switching Aoda in GH8P01F1 to a more Zn2+-chelating ncAA S-2-amino-8-hydroxyamino-8-oxooctanoic acid (Asuha) led to an extremely potent GH8HA01 that has an HDAC8-inhibition Ki value as 0.67 nM. GH8HA01 and its 5-mer truncation analogue Ac-GH8HA01{Delta}1{Delta}7 that has an HDAC8-inhibition Ki value as 0.31 nM represent two most potent HDAC8 inhibitors that have been developed so far and both are highly selective against HDAC8 over the other three tested HDACs, demonstrating the great potential of using PADLE to identify highly potent and selective ligands for targets.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous microplastics (MPs) and plastic additives in the environment usually form complexes, enter human blood circulation, and increase the risk of steatohepatitis. The liver Disse space plays a vital role in corresponding hepatic pathological processes. However, due to the limited understanding of the regulatory cues in multilineage maturation, the generation of large-scale Disse-like organoids (DOs) mirroring the comprehensive toxicity responses of MPs is challenging. Here, using human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), we biofabricated healthy donors and patient-derived DOs containing hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and hepatic stellate cells, resembling the features of Disse space. These organoids revealed that polystyrene MPs preferentially entered endothelial cells and then dispersed throughout the organoids, similar to reported studies in zebrafish. Co-exposure to MPs and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), a common plastic additive, showed enhanced accumulation of contamination in the organoids. We also biofabricated alcoholic liver disease (ALD) patient-derived DOs representing the specific disease transcriptional profiles. We found that co-exposure to MPs and TBBPA at environmental-related dosages significantly elevated the pathological transcriptional expression and biochemical profiles in patient-derived DOs but not in healthy organoids, suggesting that both hereditary factors and pollutants contribute to susceptibility to environmental toxicants. This study exemplified the value of biofabricated hiPSC-derived organoids in environmental toxicology and offered a powerful strategy for personalized toxicology evaluation.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSubcellular localisation of human proteins is essential to comprehend their functions and roles in physiological processes, which in turn helps in diagnostic and prognostic studies of pathological conditions and impacts clinical decision making. Since proteins reside at multiple locations at the same time and few subcellular locations host far more proteins than other locations, the computational task for their subcellular localisation is to train a multilabel classifier while handling data imbalance. In imbalanced data, minority classes are underrepresented, thus leading to a heavy bias towards the majority classes and the degradation of predictive capability for the minority classes. Furthermore, data imbalance in multilabel settings is an even more complex problem due to the coexistence of majority and minority classes.\n\nResultsOur studies reveal that based on the extent of concurrence of majority and minority classes, oversampling of minority samples through appropriate data augmentation techniques holds promising scope for boosting the classification performance for the minority classes. We measured the magnitude of data imbalance per class and the concurrence of majority and minority classes in the dataset. Based on the obtained values, we identified minority and medium classes, and a new oversampling method is proposed that includes nonlinear mixup, geometric and colour transformations for data augmentation and a sampling approach to prepare minibatches. Performance evaluation on the Human Protein Atlas Kaggle challenge dataset shows that the proposed method is capable of achieving better predictions for minority classes than existing methods.\n\nAvailabilityData used in this study is available at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/human-protein-atlas-image-classification/data.\n\nContactyang.song1@unsw.edu.au\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

We improved the devices design for detection of absorbance using fibre-based interrogation of samples with integrated lenses in the microfluidic PDMS device for focusing and collimation of light. This optical improvement reduces the scattering and refraction artefacts, improving the signal quality and sensitivity. The novel design allows us to overcome limitations based on dielectrophoresis sorting, such as droplet size dependency, material and dielectric properties of samples. Our acoustic activated absorbance sorter removes the need for offset dyes or matching oils and sorts about a magnitude faster than current absorbance sorter.",

    "abstract": "How do enzymes form metabolons inside cells? To answer that question, we created an all-atom model of a section of the human cytoplasm and simulated it for over 30 microseconds. Among other proteins, nucleic acids, and metabolites, the model contains three successive members of the glycolytic cycle: glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), and phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM). These enzymes interact to form transient, but long-lived, multi-enzyme complexes with characteristic lifetimes in the 1 to 5 s range, thus modeling the functional metabolon structures that facilitate compartmentalization of metabolic pathways and substrate channeling in cell. We analyze the quinary structure between enzymes down to the formation of specific hydrogen-bonded interactions between side chains, together with the movement, in concert, of water molecules in or out between interacting amino acids to mediate contact formation and dissolution. We also observed large-scale enzymatic domain motion that has been proposed to convert between substrate-accessible and catalytically functional states: a direct hinge-bending motion of up to 28{degrees} changes the relative orientation of the N- and C-terminal domains of PGK, causing the initially open, and presumably inactive, conformation of PGK to sample both \"semi-closed\" and \"closed\" conformations. Although classical molecular dynamics (MD) cannot simulate enzymatic activity, closed structures are the functionally active forms of PGK, and their equilibrium with open structures opens the door for future quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) and other reactive simulations of the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "All living cells, including neurons, generate ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) during biological activity, and in particular, in the brain, it has been shown that UPE is correlated with neuronal activity and associated metabolic processes. Various intracellular factors, as well as external factors, can reduce or increase the intensity of UPE. In this study, we have used Methamphetamine (METH) as one potentially effective external factor, which is a substance that has the property of stimulating the central nervous system. METH can impair mitochondrial function by causing toxicity via various pathways, including an increase in the number of mitochondria, hyperthermia, the increased metabolic activity of the brain, and the production of glutamate and excess calcium. In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, METH alters cellular homeostasis, leading to cell damage and the production of excess ROS. The aim of this study is to measure and compare the UPE intensity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels of the prefrontal, motor, and visual cortex before and after METH administration. Twenty male rats were randomly assigned to two groups, the control, and METH groups. In the control group, 2 hours after injection of normal saline and without any intervention, and in the experimental group 2 hours after IP injection of 20 mg/kg METH, sections were prepared from three areas: prefrontal, motor, and V1-V2 cortex, which were used to evaluate the emission of UPE using a photomultiplier tube (PMT) device and to evaluate the amount of ROS. The results showed that the amount of ROS and UPE in the experimental group in all three areas significantly increased compared to the control group. So, METH increases UPE and ROS in the prefrontal, motor, and visual regions, and there is a direct relationship between UPE intensity and ROS production. Therefore, UPE can be used as a dynamic reading tool to monitor oxidative metabolism in physiological processes related to ROS. Also, the results of this experiment can support the hypothesis that the production of excess UPE may lead to the phenomenon of phosphene and visual hallucinations.",

    "abstract": "Physical forces are important cues in determining the development and the normal function of biological tissues. While forces generated by molecular motors have been widely studied, forces resulting from osmotic gradients have been less considered in this context. A possible reason is the lack of direct in-situ measurement methods that can be applied to cell and organ culture systems. Herein, novel kinds of FRET (resonance energy transfer)-based liposomal sensors are developed, so that their sensing range and sensitivity can be adjusted to satisfy physiological osmotic conditions. Several types of sensors are prepared, either based on PEGylated liposomes with steric stabilization and stealth property or on crosslinked liposomes capable of enduring relatively harsh environments for liposomes (e.g. in the presence of biosurfactants). The sensors are demonstrated to be effective in the measurement of osmotic pressures in pre-osteoblastic in-vitro cell culture systems by means of FRET microscopy. This development paves the way towards the in-situ sensing of osmotic pressures in biological culture systems.",

    "abstract": "The role of force application in immune cell recognition is now well established, the force being transmitted between the actin cytoskeleton to the anchoring ligands through receptors such as integrins. In this chain, the mechanics of the cytoskeleton to receptor link, though clearly crucial, remains poorly understood. To probe this link, we combine mechanical extraction of membrane tubes from T cells using optical tweezers, and fitting of the resulting force curves with a viscoelastic model taking into account the cell and relevant molecules. We solicit this link using four different antibodies against various membrane bound receptors: antiCD3 to target the T Cell Receptor (TCR) complex, antiCD45 for the long sugar CD45, and two clones of antiCD11 targeting open or closed conformation of LFA1 integrins. Upon disruption of the cytoskeleton, the stiffness of the link changes for two of the receptors, exposing the existence of a receptor to cytoskeleton link - namely TCR-complex and open LFA1, and does not change for the other two where no such a link was expected. Our integrated approach allows us to probe, for the first time, the mechanics of the intracellular receptor-cytoskeleton link in immune cells.",

    "abstract": "Carbocyanines are among the best performing dyes in singlemolecule localization microscopy (SMLM), but their performance critically relies on optimized photoswitching buffers. As the chemical buffer composition controls the transitions between non-fluorescent off- and fluorescent on-states, it is ultimately linked to the maximum achievable resolution. Here, we describe a workflow for screening optimal buffer conditions for single-molecule photoswitching. This is achieved by creating an intensity gradient within the field of view using a single micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) mirror in the excitation path of the wide-field setup. Photon budget, on-state and off-state lifetimes are studied for different concentrations of mercatoethylamine (MEA) and buffer pH values. Both of MEA concentration and buffer pH determine the amount of thiolate, which is the main requirement for carbocyanine dye photoswitching. We show that thiolate acts as a concentration bandpass filter for the maximum achievable resolution and determine a minimum thiolate concentration of [~]1 mM is necessary to facilitate SMLM measurements. We also identify a concentration bandwidth of 1-16 mM in which the photoswitching performance can be balanced between high molecular brightness and high off-time to on-time ratios. Furthermore, we monitor the performance of the popular oxygen scavenger system based on glucose and glucose oxidase over time and show simple measures to avoid acidification during prolonged measurements. Finally, the impact of buffer settings is quantitatively tested on the distribution of the glucose transporter protein 4 within the plasma membrane of adipocytes. Our work provides a general strategy for achieving optimal resolution in SMLM with relevance for the development of novel buffers and dyes.",

In the case of ligand-gated ion channels, such as the muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, mechanisms of agonist activation have been studied for decades. Taking advantage of a reconstructed ancestral muscle-type {beta}-subunit that forms spontaneously activating homopentamers, here we show that incorporation of human muscle-type -subunits represses spontaneous activity, and furthermore that the presence of agonist relieves this -subunit-dependent repression. Our results demonstrate that rather than provoking channel activation/opening, agonists may instead  inhibit the inhibition of intrinsic spontaneous activity. Thus, agonist activation may be the apparent manifestation of agonist-induced derepression. These results provide insight into intermediate states that precede channel opening and have implications for the interpretation of agonism in ligand-gated ion channels.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) contact sites (MERCs) are protein- and lipid-enriched hubs that mediate intracellular communications, contributing to the dynamic transfer of Ca2+, lipid, and other metabolites between these organelles. Defective MERCs are associated with cellular oxidative stress, neurodegenerative disease, and cardiac and skeletal muscle pathology via mechanisms that are poorly understood. We previously demonstrated that skeletal muscle-specific knockdown (KD) of the mitochondrial fusion mediator optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) induced ER stress and upregulated Mitofusin-2, a known MERC protein. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that Opa1 downregulation in skeletal muscle cells induces MERC formation using multiple experimental models, including mice, Drosophila, and primary myotubes. Our results revealed that OPA1 deficiency increased MERC tethering and activated the integrated stress response (ISR) pathway effector, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Loss of OPA1, reduced mitochondria calcium uptake and caffeine-induced calcium release by the ER, which was associated with changes in expression of mediators of calcium exchange IP3R3, GRP75, VDAC, at MERCs. Reducing Atf4 expression in Opa1-deficient muscle cells altered MERC ultrastructure changes and reestablished cytosolic calcium homeostasis. These data identify a role for ATF4 in the regulation of MERCs distance and mitochondrial calcium exchange.",

    "abstract": "Recent work within neuroimaging consortia have aimed to identify reproducible, and often subtle, brain signatures of psychiatric or neurological conditions. To allow for high-powered brain imaging analyses, it is often necessary to pool MR images that were acquired with different protocols across multiple scanners. Current retrospective harmonization techniques have shown promise in removing cross-site image variation. However, most statistical approaches may over-correct for technical, scanning-related, variation as they cannot distinguish between confounded image-acquisition based variability and cross-site population variability. Such statistical methods often require that datasets contain subjects or patient groups with similar clinical or demographic information to isolate the acquisition-based variability. To overcome this limitation, we consider cross-site MRI image harmonization as a style transfer problem rather than a domain transfer problem. Using a fully unsupervised deep-learning framework based on a generative adversarial network (GAN), we show that MR images can be harmonized by inserting the style information encoded from a single reference image, without knowing their site/scanner labels a priori. We trained our model using data from five large-scale multi-site datasets with varied demographics. Results demonstrated that our style-encoding model can harmonize MR images, and match intensity profiles, without relying on traveling subjects. This model also avoids the need to control for clinical, diagnostic, or demographic information. We highlight the effectiveness of our method for clinical research by comparing extracted cortical and subcortical features, brain-age estimates, and case-control effect sizes before and after the harmonization. We showed that our harmonization removed the cross-site variances, while preserving the anatomical information and clinical meaningful patterns. We further demonstrated that with a diverse training set, our method successfully harmonized MR images collected from unseen scanners and protocols, suggesting a promising novel tool for ongoing collaborative studies.

    "abstract": "Long-term survival of Legionella pneumophila in aquatic environments is thought to be important for establishing an ecological niche necessary for epidemic outbreaks in humans. Eliminating bacterial colonization in plumbing systems is the primary strategy that depletes this reservoir and prevents disease. To uncover L. pneumophila determinants facilitating survival in water, a Tn-seq strategy was used to identify survival-defective mutants during 50-day starvation in tap water at 42{degrees}C. The mutants with most drastic survival defects carried insertions in electron transport chain genes, indicating that membrane energy charge and/or ATP synthesis requires the generation of a proton gradient by the respiratory chain to maintain survival in the presence of water stress. In addition, periplasmically-localized proteins that are known (EnhC) or hypothesized (lpg1697) to stabilize the cell wall against turnover were essential for water survival. To test that the identified mutations disrupted water survival, candidate genes were knocked down by CRISPRi. The vast majority of knockdown strains with verified transcript depletion showed remarkably low viability after 50-day incubations. To demonstrate that maintenance of cell wall integrity was an important survival determinant, a deletion mutation in lpg1697, in a gene encoding a predicted L,D-transpeptidase domain, was analyzed. The loss of this gene resulted in increased osmolar sensitivity and carbenicillin hypersensitivity relative to the WT, as predicted for loss of an L,D-transpeptidase. These results indicate that the L. pneumophila envelope has been evolutionarily selected to allow survival under conditions in which the bacteria are subjected to long-term exposure to starvation and low osmolar conditions.\n\nImportanceWater is the primary vector for transmission of L. pneumophila to humans and the pathogen is adapted to persist in this environment for extended periods of time. Preventing survival of L. pneumophila in water is therefore critical for prevention of Legionnaires disease. We analyzed dense transposon mutation pools for strains with severe survival defects during a 50-day water incubation at 42{degrees}C. By tracking the associated transposon insertion sites in the genome, we defined a distinct essential gene set for water survival and demonstrate that a predicted peptidoglycan crosslinking enzyme, lpg1697, and components of the electron transport chain are required to ensure survival of the pathogen. Our results indicate that select characteristics of the cell wall and components of the respiratory chain of L. pneumophila are primary evolutionary targets being shaped to promote its survival in water.",

Here, we establish a workflow to determine the RNA recognition and druggability of the nucleocapsid N-protein of SARS-CoV-2, a highly abundant protein crucial for the viral life cycle. We use a synergistic method that combines NMR spectroscopy and protein-RNA cross-linking coupled to mass spectrometry to quickly determine the RNA binding of two RNA recognition domains of the N-protein.

    "abstract": "BackgroundOn May 7, 2022, a case of monkeypox virus (MPXV) has been reported to the WHO. It causes a viral zoonotic disease with characteristics comparable to that of smallpox cases. Monkeypox could be a serious health concern as it is already spreading to multiple countries worldwide. To prevent the monkeypox infection and for its early detection, a potential vaccine and diagnostic candidate is urgently required.\n\nMethodIn present study we have used different in silico methods to screen the entire genome with its approximately 191 genes for potential epitopes present in proliferation and virulent proteins of monkeypox virus. All protein sequences were retrieved from different genomic and proteome databases listed in Uniprot or NCBI.\n\nResultsIn the present study we have screened potential epitopes from 11 different proteins of Monkeypox. All the included protein play an important role in pathogenesis and/or proliferation of Monkeypox virus. We have identified in total 984 CTL and 168 HTL epitopes with highest score in our epitope screening. The reported epitopes could be potential candidates for the design of an early detection diagnostic kit specific for the monkeypox virus. Out of these target peptides we have included a total of 39 CTL epitopes and 39 HTL epitopes in design of multi-epitope vaccine candidates. These shortlisted epitopes are highly conserved amongst different strains and origin of monkeypox viruses. The population coverage by joint administration of CTL and HTL MEVs is predicted to be high with the epitopes showing potential to bind upto 24 different CTL and HTL HLA allele molecules. The epitopes used in MEVs are examined to be highly immunogenic, non allergic but antigenic, and non toxic. All the CTL and HTL MEVs designed utilizing the epitopes have physiochemical properties favor its over expression in human cells. The optimized cDNA constructs of CTL and HTL MEVs also favor over expression of MEVs in human cells. Overall, the MEV construct proposed by us are fissile for expression in the lab and for further in vivo studies.\n\nConclusionControl and fight against emerging diseases such as MPXV requires pathogen diagnostic and novel vaccine approaches. We screened for several epitopes and designed a MEV providing a potential solution for both purposes. Our method allows rapid screening and provides a rational strategy for the development of vaccine candidate effective in fighting MPXV and other unexpected upcoming diseases.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of a polybasic cleavage motif for the protease furin in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein has been established as a major factor for enhanced viral transmission in humans. The peptide region N-terminal to that motif is extensively mutated in major variants of concern including Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Besides furin, spike proteins from these variants appear to rely on other proteases for maturation, including TMPRSS2 that may share the same cleavage motif. Glycans found near the cleavage site have raised questions about proteolytic processing and the consequences of variant-borne mutations. Here, with a suite of chemical tools, we establish O-linked glycosylation as a major determinant of SARS-CoV-2 spike cleavage by the host proteases furin and TMPRSS2, and as a likely driving force for the emergence of common mutations in variants of concern. We provide direct evidence that the glycosyltransferase GalNAc-T1 primes glycosylation at Thr678 in the living cell, and this glycosylation event is suppressed by many, but not all variant mutations. A novel strategy for rapid bioorthogonal modification of Thr678-containing glycopeptides revealed that introduction of a negative charge completely abrogates furin activity. In a panel of synthetic glycopeptides containing elaborated O-glycans, we found that the sole incorporation of N-acetylgalactosamine did not substantially impact furin activity, but the presence of sialic acid in elaborated O-glycans reduced furin rate by up to 65%. Similarly, O-glycosylation with a sialylated trisaccharide had a negative impact on spike cleavage by TMPRSS2. With a chemistry-centered approach, we firmly establish O-glycosylation as a major determinant of spike maturation and propose that a disruption of O-GalNAc glycosylation is a substantial driving force for the evolution of variants of concern.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/508093v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@71b54eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1361b4aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@139bdd9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1df192b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we generated a comprehensive full-length isoform annotation of human immune cells, Immune Isoform Atlas, by long-read sequencing for 29 cell subsets. Our atlas contained a number of unannotated transcripts and isoforms such as a read-through transcript of TOMM40-APOE. We profiled functional characteristics of isoforms including encoded domains, inserted repetitive elements, and translational efficiency, and we showed that repetitive elements significantly explained the diversity of unannotated isoforms. Some of the isoforms are expressed in a cell-type specific manner, whose alternative 3-UTRs usage contributed to their specificity. Further, we identified a number of disease-associated isoforms by isoform switch analysis and by integration of several quantitative trait loci analyses with genome-wide association study data. Our findings will promote the elucidation of the pathomechanism of diseases via alternative splicing.",

The performance of unbiased SRT methods targeting the polyA tail of mRNA, relies on the availability of specimens with high RNA quality. Moreover, the high cost of currently available SRT assays requires a careful sample screening process to increase the chance of obtaining high-quality data. Indeed, the upfront analysis of RNA quality can show considerable variability due to sample handling, storage, and/or intrinsic factors. We present RNA-Rescue Spatial Transcriptomics (RRST), an SRT workflow designed to improve mRNA recovery from fresh frozen (FF) specimens with moderate to low RNA quality. First, we provide a benchmark of RRST against the standard Visium spatial gene expression protocol on high RNA quality samples represented by mouse brain and prostate cancer samples. Then, we demonstrate the RRST protocol on tissue sections collected from 5 challenging tissue types, including: human lung, colon, small intestine, pediatric brain tumor, and mouse bone/cartilage. In total, we analyzed 52 tissue sections and our results demonstrate that RRST is a versatile, powerful, and reproducible protocol for FF specimens of different qualities and origins.",

    "abstract": "Macrocyclic lactones are front-line therapies for parasitic roundworm infections, but there are no comprehensive studies on the activity of this drug class against parasitic flatworms. Ivermectin is well known to be inactive against flatworms. However, the structure-activity relationship of macrocyclic lactones may vary across phyla, and it is entirely possible other members of this drug class do in fact show antiparasitic activity on flatworms. For example, there are several reports hinting at the anti-schistosomal activity of doramectin and moxidectin. To explore this class further, we developed an automated imaging assay combined with measurement of lactate levels from worm media. This assay was applied to the screening of 21 macrocyclic lactones (avermectins, milbemycins and others such as spinosyns) against adult schistosomes. These in vitro assays identified several macrocyclic lactones (emamectin, milbemycin oxime, and the moxidectin metabolite 23-ketonemadectin) that caused contractile paralysis and lack of lactate production. Several of these were also active against miracidia, a juvenile life cycle stage of the parasite. Hits prioritized from these in vitro assays were administered to mice harboring patent schistosome infections. However, no reduction in worm burden was observed. Nevertheless, these data show the utility of a multiplexed in vitro screening platform to quantitatively assess drug action and prioritize hits in a chemical series for in vivo studies. While the prototypical macrocyclic lactone ivermectin displays minimal activity against adult Schistosoma mansoni, this family of compounds does contain schistocidal compounds which may serve as a starting point for development of new anti-flatworm chemotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Herbicide resistance in weeds is a growing threat to global crop production. Non-target site resistance is problematic because a single resistance allele can confer tolerance to many herbicides (cross resistance), and it is often a polygenic trait so it can be difficult to identify the molecular mechanisms involved. Most characterized molecular mechanisms of non-target site resistance are caused by gain-of-function mutations in genes from a few key gene families - the mechanisms of resistance caused by loss-of-function mutations remain unclear. In this study, we first show that the mechanism of non-target site resistance to the herbicide thaxtomin A conferred by loss-of-function of the gene PAM16 is conserved in Marchantia polymorpha, validating its use as a model species with which to study non-target site resistance. To identify mechanisms of non-target site resistance caused by loss-of-function mutations, we generated 107 UV-B mutagenized M. polymorpha spores and screened for resistance to the herbicide thaxtomin A. We isolated 13 thaxtomin A-resistant mutants and found that 3 mutants carried candidate resistance-conferring SNPs in the MpRTN4IP1L gene. Mprtn4ip1l mutants are defective in coenzyme Q biosynthesis and accumulate higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) than wild-type plants. Mutants are also defective in thaxtomin A metabolism, consistent with the hypothesis that loss of MpRTN4IP1L function confers non-target site resistance. We conclude that loss of MpRTN4IP1L function is a novel mechanism of non-target site herbicide resistance, and propose that other mutations which increase ROS levels or decrease thaxtomin A metabolism could confer thaxtomin A resistance in the field.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYModern agriculture relies on herbicides to control weed populations. However, herbicide resistance in weeds threatens the efficacy of herbicides and global crop production, similar to how antibiotic resistance poses a global health threat. Understanding the molecular mechanisms behind herbicide resistance helps to prevent resistance from evolving and to better manage herbicide resistant weeds in the field. Here, we use a forward genetic approach in the model species Marchantia polymorpha to discover novel mechanisms of herbicide resistance. We report the discovery of a novel mechanism of herbicide resistance caused by loss-of-function mutations in the MpRTN4IP1L gene. We find that Mprtn4ip1l mutants are resistant to the herbicides thaxtomin A and isoxaben, accumulate higher levels of reactive oxygen species than wild type plants, and are defective in thaxtomin A metabolism. We predict that loss-of-function mutations or treatments that increase reactive oxygen species production could contribute to thaxtomin A tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Agent-based models (ABMs) are readily used to capture the stochasticity in tumour evolution; however, these models are often challenging to validate with experimental measurements due to model complexity. The Voronoi cell-based model (VCBM) is an off-lattice agent-based model that captures individual cell shapes using a Voronoi tessellation and mimics the evolution of cancer cell proliferation and movement. Evidence suggests tumours can exhibit biphasic growth in vivo. To account for this phenomena, we extend the VCBM to capture the existence of two distinct growth phases. Prior work primarily focused on point estimation for the parameters without consideration of estimating uncertainty. In this paper, approximate Bayesian computation is employed to calibrate the model to in vivo measurements of breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer. Our approach involves estimating the distribution of parameters that govern cancer cell proliferation and recovering outputs that match the experimental data. Our results show that the VCBM, and its biphasic extension, provides insight into tumour growth and quantifies uncertainty in the switching time between the two phases of the biphasic growth model. We find this approach enables precise estimates for the time taken for a daughter cell to become a mature cell. This allows us to propose future refinements to the model to improve accuracy, whilst also making conclusions about the differences in cancer cell characteristics.",

The surprise signal modulates synaptic plasticity via a three-factor learning rule which increases plasticity at moments of surprise. The surprise signal remains small when transitions between sensory events follow a previously learned rule but increases immediately after rule switching. In our model, previously learned rules are protected against overwriting when learning a new rule.

    "abstract": "SummaryProactive cognition brain models are mainstream nowadays. Within these, preparation is understood as an endogenous, top-down function that takes place prior to the actual perception of a stimulus and improves subsequent behavior. Neuroimaging has shown the existence of such preparatory activity separately in different cognitive domains, however no research to date has sought to uncover their potential similarities and differences. Two of these, often confounded in the literature, are Selective Attention (information relevance) and Perceptual Expectation (information probability). We used EEG to characterize the mechanisms that pre-activate specific contents in Attention and Expectation. In different blocks, participants were cued to the relevance or to the probability of target categories, faces vs. names, in a gender discrimination task. Multivariate Pattern (MVPA) and Representational Similarity Analyses (RSA) during the preparation window showed that both manipulations led to a significant, ramping-up prediction of the relevant or expected target category. However, classifiers trained on data from one condition did not generalize to the other, indicating the existence of unique anticipatory neural patterns. In addition, a Canonical Template Tracking procedure showed that there was stronger anticipatory perceptual reinstatement for relevance than for expectation blocks. Overall, results indicate that preparation during attention and expectation acts through distinguishable neural mechanisms. These findings have important implications for current models of brain functioning, as they are a first step towards characterizing and dissociating the neural mechanisms involved in top-down anticipatory processing.",

    "abstract": "Complex distribution data can be summarised by grouping species with similar or overlapping distributions to unravel patterns in species distributions and separate trends (e.g., of habitat loss) among spatially unique groups. However, such classifications are often heuristic, lacking the transparency, objectivity, and data-driven rigour of quantitative methods, which limits their interpretability and utility. Here, we develop and illustrate the clustering of spatially associated species, a methodological framework aimed at statistically classifying species using explicit measures of interspecific spatial association. We investigate several association indices and clustering algorithms and show how these methodological choices engender substantial variations in clustering outcome and performance. To facilitate robust decision making, we provide guidance on choosing methods appropriate to the study objective(s). As a case study, we apply the framework to model tree distributions in Borneo to evaluate the impact of land-cover change on separate species groupings. We identified 11 distinct clusters that unravelled ecologically meaningful patterns in Bornean tree distributions. These clusters then enabled us to quantify trends of habitat loss tied to each of those specific clusters, allowing us to discern particularly vulnerable species clusters and their distributions. This study demonstrates the advantages of adopting quantitatively derived clusters of spatially associated species and elucidates the potential of resultant clusters as a spatially explicit framework for investigating distribution-related questions in ecology, biogeography, and conservation. By adopting our methodological framework and publicly available codes, practitioners can leverage the ever-growing abundance of distribution data to better understand complex spatial patterns among species distributions and the disparate effects of global changes on biodiversity.\n\nStatement of authorshipSEHP and ELW conceived the idea and designed methodology.

    "abstract": "Late-Onset Alzheimers Disease (LOAD) is a heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorder with complex etiology and high heritability. Its multifactorial risk profile and large portions of unexplained heritability suggest the involvement of yet unidentified genetic risk factors. Here we describe the \"whole person\" genetic risk landscape of polygenic risk scores for 2,218 traits in 2,044 elderly individuals and test if novel eigen-PRSs derived from clustered subnetworks of single-trait PRSs can improve prediction of LOAD diagnosis, rates of cognitive decline, and canonical LOAD neuropathology. Principal component analyses of thousands of PRSs found generally poor global correlation among traits. However, component loadings confirmed covariance of clinically and biologically related traits and diagnoses, with the top PCs representing autoimmune traits, cardiovascular traits, and general pain medication prescriptions, depending on the PRS variant inclusion threshold. Network analyses revealed distinct clusters of PRSs with clinical and biological interpretability. Novel eigen-PRSs (ePRS) derived from these clusters were significantly associated with LOAD-related phenotypes and improved predictive model performance over the state-of-the-art LOAD PRS alone. Notably, an ePRS representing clusters of traits related to cholesterol levels was able to improve variance explained in a model of brain-wide beta-amyloid burden by 1.7% (likelihood ratio test p=9.02x10-7). While many associations of ePRS with LOAD phenotypes were eliminated by the removal of APOE-proximal loci, some modules (e.g. retinal defects, acidosis, colon health, ischaemic heart disease) showed associations at an unadjusted type I error rate. Our approach reveals new relationships between genetic risk for vascular, inflammatory, and other age-related traits and offers improvements over the existing single-trait PRS approach to capturing heritable risk for cognitive decline and beta-amyloid accumulation. Our results are catalogued for the scientific community, to aid in the generation of new hypotheses based on our maps of clustered PRSs and associations with LOAD-related phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Individual behavioral variation is common, yet often we do not know how it is maintained. A potential explanation is that some behaviors must be acquired rather than genetically inherited. We investigate the social transmission of behavioral innovations, which can be key for the success of predator species, especially in contexts where environmental changes take place. We examine innovation in two classic predator-prey models. We assume that innovations increase predator attack rates or conversion efficiencies, or that innovations reduce predator mortality or prey handling time. We find that a common outcome of innovations is the destabilization of the system. Destabilizing effects include increasing oscillations or limit cycles. If either of these outcomes increases the risk of extinction, innovations that benefit individual predators may not have positive long-term effects on predator populations. Furthermore, as populations cycle, innovative individuals can be nearly eliminated, maintaining temporal behavioral variability. The destabilizing effects of behavioral innovations on predator-prey dynamics could have implications for biological invasions, urban populations, endangered species, and, more broadly, the maintenance of behavioral polymorphisms.",

Consequently, these overlooked metabolites are often set aside and the interpretation of metabolic signatures is restricted to a subset of the significant metabolites. To suggest potential pathological phenotypes related to these understudied metabolites, we extend the  guilt by association principle to literature information by using a Bayesian framework.

    "abstract": "As a well-known driving force of diseases in crops, climate change is likely to impact future crop yields. In the present work, we account for climate-related influences on the key parameters of a SIR-type epidemiological model for fungal diseases in stone fruit aimed at simulating different observed epidemic patterns, and, eventually, evaluating the possible impacts of climate change on the disease-induced yield loss. Brown rot disease in peach orchards is used here as a study system. We contrasted simulation results with epidemiological measures collected from an experimental orchard in Avignon (southern France) in two consecutive years, characterized by dissimilar brown rot outbreaks. The capacity of our climate-driven model to adequately reproduce the observed disease patterns suggests temperature and precipitation as key drivers of brown rot epidemics. Overall, the model predicts a potential decrease of brown rot severity under warmer and drier climatic conditions. To comprehensively understand the effect of future climate change on peach yield, alterations of crop phenology must also be accounted for. We thus build a model that considers the synergism between the two factors: vulnerability to the pathogen and varying phenology. Using plausible climate change scenarios, we find that the peach yield in the considered Mediterranean region will be considerably impaired: although brown rot-related yield losses are expected to decrease in warmer and drier climatic conditions, climate change will hinder fruit blooming and consequently the yield because milder winters will impede the achievement of dormancy. By deepening our understanding of climatic impacts on crop fungal infections, the present study may serve as a useful tool to plan and implement suitable adaptation strategies for peach cultivation.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveElectroencephalography (EEG) studies increasingly make use of more ecologically valid experimental protocols involving mobile participants who actively engage with their environment (MoBI; Gramann et al., 2011). These mobile paradigms lead to increased artifacts in the recorded data that are often treated using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). When analyzing EEG data, especially in a mobile context, removing samples regarded as artifactual is a common approach before computing ICA. Automatic tools for this exist, such as the automatic sample rejection of the AMICA algorithm (Palmer et al., 2011), but the impact of the two factors movement intensity and the automatic sample rejection has not been systematically evaluated yet.\n\nApproachWe computed AMICA decompositions on eight datasets from six open-access studies with varying degrees of movement intensities using increasingly conservative sample rejection criteria. We evaluated the subsequent decomposition quality in terms of the component mutual information, the amount of brain, muscle, and \"other\" components, the residual variance of the brain components, and an exemplary signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nMain resultsWe found that increasing movements of participants led to decreasing decomposition quality for individual datasets but not as a general trend across all movement intensities. The cleaning strength had less impact on decomposition results than anticipated, and moderate cleaning of the data resulted in the best decompositions.\n\nSignificanceOur results indicate that the AMICA algorithm is very robust even with limited data cleaning. Moderate amounts of cleaning such as 5 to 10 iterations of the AMICA sample rejection with 3 standard deviations as the threshold will likely improve the decomposition of most datasets, irrespective of the movement intensity.",

To overcome the limitations of surface marker-based analyses, we utilized DC-reporter mice (Zbtb46GFP/+) to isolate tissue and tumor DCs and performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq). The known DC subsets were conserved across tissues, albeit at different frequencies. Activated and mature DCs formed a distinct cluster in both healthy and tumor tissues and displayed the hallmark DC migratory program (migratory DCs). We also identified a distinct subset of activated DCs in tumors that did not induce the migratory program, instead displaying signatures of interferon exposure (interferon-DCs or IFN-DCs). IFN-DCs were proficient in antigen-presentation, supported T cell proliferation, and expressed high levels of T cell-attracting chemokines. IFN-DCs further comprised of IFN1- and IFN2-DCs that were generated from CD11b+ DCs in response to type I or type II interferons respectively. We also identified IFN-DCs in scRNA-seq of human tumor-infiltrating leukocytes. These findings illustrate DC heterogeneity in tumors and suggest the existence of an interferon regulated  division of labor among activated DCs whereby the migratory DCs drive T cell priming in draining lymph nodes while the sessile IFN-DCs help recruit T cells and regulate their function in the tumor microenvironment.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTumors harbor an interferon-regulated activated sessile subset of dendritic cells.",

    "abstract": "Chiles isolation and varied climates have driven the evolution of a unique biodiversity with a high degree of endemism. The Mediterranean-type biome of Central Chile is one of 35 global biodiversity hotspots and has been highlighted as one of Chiles most endangered areas. It is threatened by anthropogenic land use change impacting the integrity of local biomes and associated species. This area holds the most extensive collections of the country with high endemicity regarding native bee species. Characterising habitat requirements of bees is a pressing priority to safeguard them and the ecosystem services they provide.\n\nWe investigated broad-scale patterns of bee diversity using newly accessible expert-validated datasets comprising digitized specimen records from both Chilean and US collections and novel, expert-validated type specimen data for the bees of Chile. We used a generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) approach to explore both compositional and phylogenetic {beta}-diversity patterns across latitudinal, altitudinal, climate and habitat gradients in well-sampled bee assemblages in Central Chile. Using the GDM measures of increasing compositional and environmental dissimilarity we categorised and compared the most important drivers of these patterns and used them to classify  wild bee ecoregions (WBE) representing unique assemblages.\n\nTurnover of bee assemblages was explained primarily by latitudinal variation (proxy for climate) along Chile. However, temperature variations, precipitation and the presence of bare soil also significantly explained the observed patterns. In comparison, we observed less turnover in phylogenetic biodiversity corresponding to spatial gradients. We were able to develop six de novo ecoregions (WBE) all with distinct taxa, endemic lineages, and representative species. The WBE represent distinct spatial classifications but have similarities to existing biogeographical classifications, ecosystems and bioclimatic zones.\n\nThis approach establishes the baseline needed to prioritise bee species conservation efforts across this global biodiversity hotspot. We discuss the novelty of this classification considering previous biogeographical characterisations and its relevance for assessing conservation priorities for bee conservation. We argue that Chiles WBE show areas requiring funding for bee species exploration and description, distribution mapping and strengthening of conservation policies.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection is a major force shaping morphological and behavioral diversity. Existing theory focuses on courtship display traits such as morphological ornaments whose costs and benefits are assumed be to fixed across individuals lifetimes. In contrast, empirically observed displays are often inherently dynamic, as vividly illustrated by the acrobatic dances, loud vocalizations, and vigorous motor displays involved in courtship behavior across a broad range of taxa. One empirically observed form of display flexibility occurs when signalers adjust their courtship investment based on the number of rival signalers. The predictions of established sexual selection theory cannot readily be extended to such displays because display expression varies between courtship events, such that any given display may not reliably reflect signaler quality. Thus, we lack an understanding of how dynamic displays coevolve with sexual preferences and how signalers should tactically adjust their display investment across multiple courtship opportunities. To address these questions, we extended an established model of the coevolution of a female sexual preference and a male display trait to allow for dynamic, flexible displays. We find that a dynamic display can coevolve with a sexual preference away from their naturally selected optima, though display intensity is a weaker signal of male quality than for static ornaments. Furthermore, we find that males evolve to decrease their display investment when displaying alongside more rivals. This research represents a first step towards generalizing the findings of sexual selection theory to account for the ubiquitous dynamism of animal courtship.\n\nSignificance StatementAnimal courtship displays are typically costly for survival: songs attract predators; dances are exhausting; extravagant plumage is cumbersome. Because of the trade-off between mating benefits and survival costs, displaying individuals often vary their displays across time, courting more intensely when the potential benefit is higher or the cost is lower. Despite the ubiquity of such adjustment in nature, existing theory cannot account for how this flexibility might affect the coevolution of displays with sexual preferences, nor for the patterns of tactical display adjustment that might result, because those models treat displays as static, with fixed costs and benefits. Generalizing a well-studied model of sexual selection, we find that a static display and a flexible display can evolve under similar conditions. Our model predicts that courtship should be less intense when more competitors are present.",

We identified RAD51 and RPA1A as partners of virus-encoded Rep protein. The two DNA repair proteins showed increased binding to heterochromatic regions and defense-related genes in atxr5 atxr6 vs wild type plants. Consequently, the proteins had reduced interactions to viral DNA in the mutant, thus hampering viral replication. Additionally, RAD51 recruitment to the host genome arose via BRCA1, HOP2 and CYCB1, and this recruitment was essential for viral resistance in atxr5 atxr6.

    "abstract": "Many species are facing unprecedented population size declines and deterioration of their environment. This exposes species to genomic erosion, which we define here as the damage inflicted to a species genome or gene pool due to a loss of genetic diversity, an increase in expressed genetic load, maladaptation, and/or genetic introgression. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) bases its extinction risk assessments on direct threats to population size and habitat. However, it does not assess the long-term impacts of genomic erosion, and hence, it is likely to underestimate the extinction risk of many species. High-quality whole genome sequence data that is currently being generated could help improve extinction risk assessments. Genomic data contains information about a species past demography, its genome-wide genetic diversity, the incidence of genetic introgression, as well as the genetic load of deleterious mutations. Computer modelling of these data enables forecasting of population trajectories under different management scenarios. In this Perspective, we discuss the threats posed by genomic erosion. Using evolutionary genomic simulations, we argue that whole genome sequence data provides critical information for assessing the extinction risk and recovery potential of species. Genomics-informed assessments of the extinction risk complement the IUCN Red List, and such genomics-informed conservation is invaluable in guiding species recovery programs in the UNs Decade on Ecosystem Restoration and beyond.",

A. besseyi is also a species complex with strains exhibiting varying pathogenicity to plants. We present the genome and annotations of six Aphelenchoides species, four of which belonged to the A. besseyi species complex. Most Aphelenchoides genomes have a size of 44.7-47.4 Mb and are amongst the smallest in clade IV, with the exception of A. fujianensis, which has a size of 143.8 Mb and is the largest. Phylogenomic analysis successfully delimited the species complex into A. oryzae and A. pseudobesseyi and revealed a reduction of transposon elements in the last common ancestor of Aphelenchoides. Synteny analyses between reference genomes indicated that three chromosomes in A. besseyi were derived from fission and fusion events. A systematic identification of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) genes across 27 representative nematodes allowed us to identify two major episodes of acquisition corresponding to the last common ancestor of clade IV or major PPNs, respectively. These genes were mostly lost and differentially retained between clades or strains. Most HGT events were acquired from bacteria, followed by fungi, and also from plants; plant HGT was especially prevalent in Bursaphelenchus mucronatus.

    "abstract": "High grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC) is characterised by poor outcome and extreme chromosome instability (CIN). Therapies targeting centrosome amplification (CA), a key mediator of chromosome missegregation and CIN, may have significant clinical utility in HGSOC. However, the prevalence of CA in HGSOC, its relationship to genomic biomarkers of CIN and its potential impact on therapeutic response have not been defined. Using high-throughput multi-regional microscopy on 287 clinical HGSOC tumour tissues and 73 ovarian cancer cell lines, we show that CA through centriole overduplication is a highly recurrent and heterogeneous feature of HGSOC and is strongly associated with CIN and genome subclonality. Cell-based studies showed that high prevalence CA is phenocopied in ovarian cancer cell lines, and that high CA is associated with increased multi-treatment resistance; most notably to paclitaxel which is the most common treatment used in HGSOC. CA in HGSOC may therefore present a potential driver of tumour evolution and a powerful biomarker for response to standard-of-care treatment.",

    "abstract": "Reactive carbonyl species (RCS) such as methylglyoxal (MGO) and glyoxal (GO) are highly reactive, unwanted side-products of cellular metabolism maintained at harmless intracellular levels by specific scavenging mechanisms. MGO and GO are metabolized through the glyoxalase (GLX) system, which consists of two enzymes acting in sequence, GLXI and GLXII. While plant genomes encode a large number of different GLX isoforms, it is unclear what their specific functions are and how these arose in evolution. Here, we show that plants possess two GLX systems of different evolutionary origins and with distinct structural and functional properties. The first system is shared by all eukaryotes, scavenges MGO and GO especially during seedling establishment, and features Zn2+-type GLXI, a metal co-factor preference that arose already in the last eukaryotic common ancestor. The GLXI and GLXII of the second system can together metabolize KDG, a glucose-derived RCS, and were acquired by the last common ancestor of viridiplantae through horizontal gene transfer from proteobacteria. In contrast to bacterial GLXI homologs, which are active as dimers, plant Ni2+-type GLXI contain a domain duplication, are active as monomers, and have modified their second active site. The acquisition and neofunctionalization of a structurally, biochemically, and functionally distinct GLX systems indicate that viridiplantae are under strong selection to detoxify a diversity of RCS.",

    "abstract": "Neuromorphic chips are well-suited for the exploration of neuronal dynamics in (near) real-time. In order to port existing research onto these chips, relevant models of neuronal and synaptic dynamics first need to be supported by their respective development environments and validated against existing simulator backends. At the time of writing, support for short-term synaptic plasticity on neuromorphic hardware is scarce. This technical paper proposes an implementation of dynamic synapses for the SpiNNaker development environment based on the popular synaptic plasticity model by Tsodyks and Markram (TM). This extension is undertaken in the context of existing research on neuromodulation and the study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) effects on singular-neuron responses. The implementation of the TM synapse is first detailed and then, simulated for various response types. Its role in studies of DBS effect on postsynaptic responses is also reviewed. Finally, given the real-time capabilities offered by the hardware, we provide some insight to lay the groundwork for future explorations of closed-loop DBS on neuromorphic chips.",

    "abstract": "Effector CD8+ T cell interactions are critical in controlling viral infection by directly killing infected cells but overabundant or sustained activation also exacerbates tissue damage. Chemokines promote the trafficking of effector CD8+ T cells into infected tissues, but we know little about how chemokines regulate the function of CD8+ T cells within tissues. Using a murine model of influenza A virus infection, we found that expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR4 by lung-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells correlated with the expression of the degranulation marker CD107a. Inhibition of CXCR4 reduced activation, adhesion, and degranulation of cytotoxic T cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, in live influenza-infected lung tissue, T cells stopped moving in lung regions with high levels of influenza antigen, and CXCR4 was essential for CD8+ T cells to execute this arrest signal fully. In contrast, CXCR4 increased the motility of CD8+ T cells in low-influenza areas of the lung. We also found that CXCR4 stimulated the effector function of lung-infiltrating cytotoxic T cells even after clearance of influenza virus, and inhibition of CXCR4 expedited the recovery of influenza-infected mice, despite delayed clearance of the replication-competent virus. Our results suggest that CXCR4 promotes the interaction strength of cytotoxic T cells in lung tissue through combined effects on T cell movement and interaction with virally infected target cells in influenza infected-lungs.",

    "abstract": "The Major Histocompatibility Complex class I (MHC-I) molecules present antigenic peptides (AP) to CD8+ T cells for self versus non-self recognition. Loading of AP on MHC-I takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), upon shuttling of cytoplasmic AP substrates to the ER. Understanding of this process has been influenced by the view that MHC-I antigens are produced from the proteasomal degradation of cellular proteins. Recent observations on the intronic and untranslated region-derived peptides as well as on the non-AUG translation products presented on the MHC-I open the possibility that antigenic peptides can derive from pre-spliced mRNAs translated in the nuclear compartment. In this brief report, we show that a fraction of human MHC-I molecules (human leukocyte antigens type A, HLA-A) is present in the nuclei of cells, in the proximity of histone H2B. With this finding, we hope to initiate a new direction of research on the nuclear role of MHC-I and ask whether the loading of antigens can take place in the nuclear compartment.",

    "abstract": "Mast cells are abundant in melanoma tumors, and studies suggest that they can be either detrimental or protective for melanoma growth. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we adopted a hanging drop-established spheroid system to investigate how mast cells can influence melanoma growth and phenotype in a 3-D context. In the presence of mast cells or mast cell-conditioned medium, melanoma spheroid growth was profoundly reduced. To address the underlying mechanism, we conducted a transcriptomic analysis, which revealed that mast cell-conditioned medium had extensive effects on the melanoma gene expression patterns. Pathway analyses revealed profound effects on the expression of genes related to amino acid and protein metabolism. The conditioned medium also induced an upregulated expression of cancer-related genes, including adhesion molecules implicated in metastatic spreading. In line with this, after transfer to a Matrigel extracellular matrix milieu, spheroids that had been developed in the presence of mast cell-conditioned medium displayed enhanced elevated growth and adhesive properties. However, when assessing for possible effects of nutrient starvation, i.e., reduced nutrient content in mast cell-conditioned medium, we found that the observed effects on melanoma spheroid growth potentially could be explained by such effects. Hence, it cannot be excluded that the observed phenotypic alterations of melanoma spheroids grown in the presence of mast cells or mast cell-conditioned media are, at least partly, due to nutrient starvation rather than to the action of factors secreted by mast cells. Instead, our findings may provide insight into the effects on gene expression events that occur in melanoma tumors under nutrient stress.",

Egg size is an adaptive and ecologically important trait potentially with genetic variation across different populations. However, the low throughput of manual measurement of egg size has hampered the widespread use of this trait in evolutionary biology and population genetics. We established a method for accurate and high throughput measurement of Drosophila egg size using large particle flow cytometry (LPFC). The size estimates using LPFC are accurate and highly correlated with the manual measurements. The measurement of egg size is high throughput (average of 214 eggs measured per minute) and viable eggs of a specific size can be sorted rapidly (average of 70 eggs per minute). Sorting by LPFC does not reduce the survival of eggs making it a suitable approach for sorting eggs for downstream analyses. This protocol can be applied to any organism within the detectable size range (10-1500 m) of the large particle flow cytometers. We discuss the potential applications of this method and provide recommendations for optimizing the protocol for other organisms.",

A pressing need for ADTKD is to bridge the gap between postulated gain-of-function mutations and organ damage - a prerequisite for therapeutic development. Based on two missense UMOD mutations associated with divergent progression of ADTKD, we generated UmodC171Y and UmodR186S knock-in mice that showed strong allelic and gene dosage effects, with distinct dynamic pathways impacting on uromodulin trafficking, formation of intracellular aggregates, activation of ER stress, unfolded protein and immune responses, kidney damage and progression to kidney failure. Deletion of the wild-type Umod allele in heterozygous UmodR186S mice increased the formation of uromodulin aggregates and ER stress, indicating a protective role of wild-type uromodulin. Studies in kidney tubular cells confirmed biochemical differences between distinct uromodulin aggregates, with activation of specific quality control and clearance mechanisms. Enhancement of autophagy by starvation and mTORC1 inhibition decreased the uromodulin aggregates, suggesting a therapeutic strategy. These studies substantiate a model for allelic effects and the role of toxic aggregates in the progression of ADTKD-UMOD, with relevance for toxic gain-of-function mechanisms and for strategies to improve clearance of mutant uromodulin.",

    "abstract": "The blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a noninvasive technique that has been widely used in research to study brain function. However, fMRI suffers from susceptibility-induced off resonance fields which may cause geometric distortions and mismatches with anatomical images. State-of-the-art correction methods require acquiring reverse phase encoded images or additional field maps to enable distortion correction. However, not all imaging protocols include these additional scans and thus cannot take advantage of these susceptibility correction capabilities. As such, in this study we aim to enable state-of-the-art distortion correction with FSLs topup algorithm of historical and/or limited fMRI data that include only a structural image and single phase encoded fMRI. To do this, we use 3D U-net models to synthesize undistorted fMRI BOLD contrast images from the structural image and use this undistorted synthetic image as an anatomical target for distortion correction with topup. We evaluate the efficacy of this approach, named SynBOLD-DisCo (synthetic BOLD images for distortion correction), and show that BOLD images corrected using our approach are geometrically more similar to structural images than the distorted BOLD data and are practically equivalent to state-of-the-art correction methods which require reverse phase encoded data. Future directions include additional validation studies, integration with other preprocessing operations, retraining with broader pathologies, and investigating the effects of spin echo versus gradient echo images for training and distortion correction. In summary, we demonstrate SynBOLD-DisCo corrects distortion of fMRI when reverse phase encoding scans or field maps are not available.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is a high throughput sequencing method that has become one the most employed tools in transcriptomics. The implementation of optimal bioinformatic analyses required in RNA-seq experiments may be complicated due to the large amounts of data generated by the sequencing platforms, along with the intrinsic nature of these data types. In the last years many programs and pipelines have been developed for differential expression (DE) analyses, but their effectiveness can be reduced when working with non-model species lacking public genomic resources. Moreover, there is not a universal recipe for all the experiments and datasets and the modification of standard RNA-seq bioinformatic pipelines through parameter tuning and the use of alternative software may have a strong impact in the outcome of DE analysis. Therefore, although the selection of the most accurate DE pipeline configuration and the evaluation of how these changes could affect the final DE results in RNA-seq experiments is mandatory to reduce bias, the lack of gold-standard datasets with known expression patterns hampers its implementation. In the present manuscript we present DEGoldS, a workflow consisting on sequential Bash and R scripts to construct gold-standards for simulation-based benchmarking of user selected pipelines for DE analysis and the computation of the accuracy of the pipelines. We validated the workflow with a case study consisting on real RNA-seq libraries of radiata pine, an important forest tree species with no publicly available reference genome.

    "abstract": "The Gram-negative bacterium Klebsiella pneumoniae is notorious for a strong increase of infections with antibiotic resistant strains. To treat infections with antibiotic resistant K. pneumoniae, clinicians increasingly need to use the last resort antibiotic colistin. K. pneumoniae can develop colistin resistance by modifying its membranes. During infection the membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are also targeted by the human immune system via the complement system. Gram-negative bacteria have an outer and inner membrane separated by a thin cell wall. Activation of the complement system leads to the formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC), a pore that inserts into the outer membrane, and ultimately leads to lysis of the bacterium. As both colistin and the MAC interact with the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, we wondered if developing colistin resistance influences MAC-mediated killing of K. pneumoniae.\n\nUsing clinical isolates that developed colistin resistance, we found that the strain Kp209_CSTR became more sensitive to MAC-mediated killing compared to the wild-type strain. MAC-mediated membrane permeabilization of Kp209_CSTR required antibody dependent activation of the classical complement pathway. Strikingly, Kp209_CSTR was bound by IgM in human serum that did not recognise the wild-type strain. Depletion of Kp209_CSTR-specific antibodies from serum prevented MAC-mediated membrane permeabilization, which was restored by adding back IgM. Genomic sequence comparison revealed that Kp209_CSTR has a deletion in the phoQ gene. RNAseq analysis suggested that this mutation locks PhoQ in a constitutively active state. These results indicate that PhoQ activation in Kp209_CSTR leads to both colistin resistance and sensitivity to MAC-mediated killing. Together, our results show that developing colistin resistance can sensitize K. pneumoniae to killing by the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Urbanisation is increasing at a phenomenal rate across the globe, transforming landscapes, presenting organisms with novel challenges, shaping phenotypic traits, and even impacting fitness. Among colour traits, urban individuals are widely claimed to have duller tones in carotenoid-based traits, the so-called \"urban dullness\" phenomenon. However, at the intra-specific level, this generalisation is surprisingly inconsistent and often based on examples from single urban/non-urban population pairs or a limited geographic area. Here, combining correlational, experimental, and meta-analytical results from a common songbird, the great tit (Parus major), we investigated carotenoid-based plumage coloration in urban and forest populations across Europe. We find that, as predicted, urban individuals are paler than forest individuals. Interestingly, we also find large population-specific differences in the magnitude of the urban-forest contrast in plumage colouration. Moreover, our meta-analysis indicates a non-significant effect of environmental pollution on carotenoid-based plumage for the species, suggesting that the observed differences across urban populations are not only driven by pollution. Finally, using one region as an example (Malmo, Sweden), we reveal population-specific processes behind plumage colouration differences, which are likely the result of variation in the spatial and temporal distribution of carotenoid-rich resources in anthropogenic environments. This is the first study to quantify the consistency of an oft-cited textbook example of the impact of urbanisation on wildlife; our results provide the most convincing evidence to date of the \"urban dullness\" phenomenon, but also highlight that the magnitude of the phenomenon depends on local urban characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Coevolved interactions between mitochondrial-encoded and nuclear-encoded genes within populations can be disrupted by inter-population hybridization resulting in reduced hybrid fitness. This hybrid breakdown may be an important factor contributing to reproductive isolation between populations or species, and strong selection among hybrids to maintain compatible mitonuclear genotypes occurs in at least some species. Despite potentially differential consequences of mitonuclear incompatibilities in females and males due to maternal inheritance of the mitochondrial genome, the extent to which phenotypic variation associated with hybrid breakdown is sex-specific and heritable remains unresolved. Here we present two experiments investigating variation in developmental rate among reciprocal inter-population hybrids of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus. Developmental rate is a proxy for fitness in this species that is substantially influenced by variation in mitonuclear compatibility among hybrids. First, we show that F2 hybrid developmental rate is the same in females and males, suggesting that effects of mitonuclear incompatibilities on this trait are likely experienced equally by the two sexes. Second, we demonstrate that variation in developmental rate among F3 hybrids is heritable; times to copepodid metamorphosis of F4 offspring of fast-developing F3 parents (12.25 {+/-} 0.05 d,  {+/-} SEM) were significantly faster than those of F4 offspring of slow-developing parents (14.58 {+/-} 0.05 d). Taken together, these results provide evidence for strong effects of mitonuclear interactions across generations of hybrid eukaryotes with no differences between the sexes, and support key roles of mitonuclear incompatibility in hybrid breakdown and reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "Morphological integration is relevant to evolutionary biology and paleontology because the structure of variation within populations determines the ways in which a population can respond to selective pressures. However, understanding the macroevolutionary consequences of morphological integration is elusive because the adaptive landscape is dynamic and population-level constraints themselves evolve. By analyzing a previously published dataset of 2859 ruminant crania with 3D geometric morphometrics and phylogenetic comparative methods, we find that variation within and between ruminant species is biased by a highly conserved mammalian-wide allometric pattern, CREA, where larger species have proportionally longer faces. More tightly integrated species and species more biased towards CREA have diverged farther from their ancestors, and Ruminantia as a clade diversified farther than expected in the direction anticipated by CREA. Our analyses indicate that CREA acts as an evolutionary  line of least resistance and facilitates morphological diversification due to its alignment with the browser-grazer continuum. These results demonstrate that biological processes constraining variation at the microevolutionary level can produce highly directional phenotypic evolution over macroevolutionary timescales.",

Prion diseases are transmissible to laboratory rodents affording unprecedented opportunities to understand neurodegeneration in its evolving stages. Murine models are especially useful in prion research as they develop bona fide prion disease and recapitulate all biochemical and neuropathological hallmarks of human prion disease.

    "abstract": "The first encounter with influenza virus biases later immune responses. This \"immune imprinting\", formerly from infection within a few years of birth, is in the U.S. now largely from immunization with a quadrivalent, split vaccine (IIV4). In a pilot study of IIV4 imprinting, we characterized, by single-B-cell cultures, NextGen sequencing, and plasma antibody proteomics, the primary antibody responses to influenza in two infants during their first two years of seasonal influenza vaccination. One infant, who received only a single vaccination in Year 1, contracted an influenza B (IBV) infection between the two years, allowing us to compare imprinting by infection and vaccination. That infant had a shift in hemagglutinin (HA)-reactive B-cell specificity from largely influenza A (IAV)-specific in Year 1 to IBV-specific in Year 2, both before and after vaccination. HA-reactive B cells from the other infant maintained a more evenly distributed specificity. In Year 2, class-switched HA-specific B cell IGHV somatic hypermutation (SHM) levels reached average levels seen in adults. The HA-reactive plasma antibody repertoires of both infants comprised a relatively small number of antibody clonotypes, with one or two very abundant clonotypes. Thus, after the Year 2 boost, both infants had overall B cell profiles that resembled those of adult controls.\n\nImportanceInfluenza virus is a moving target for the immune system. Variants emerge that escape protection from antibodies elicited by a previously circulating variant (\"antigenic drift\"). The immune system usually responds to a drifted influenza virus by mutating existing antibodies rather than by producting entirely new ones. Thus, immune memory of the earliest influenza exposure has a major influence on later responses to infection or vaccination (\"immune imprinting\"). In the many studies of influenza immunity in adult subjects, imprinting has been from an early infection, since only in the past two decades have infants received influenza immunizations. The work reported in this paper is a pilot study of imprinting in two infants by the flu vaccine, which they received before experiencing an influenza infection. The results suggest that a quadrivalent (four-subtype) vaccine may provide an immune imprint less dominated by one subtype than does a monovalent infection.",

    "abstract": "Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe immune-mediated prothrombotic disorder caused by antibodies reactive to complexes of platelet factor 4 and heparin. Platelets (PLTs) and their interaction with different immune cells contribute to prothrombotic conditions in HIT. However, the exact mechanisms and the role of different PLT subpopulations to this prothrombotic enviroment remain poorly understood. In this study, we observed that HIT patient antibodies (Abs) induce relevant changes in PLT phenotype, with the key features being increased P-Selectin expression and procoagulant phosphatidylserine (PS) externalization. Formation of procoagulant PLTs was dependent on engagement of PLT Fc-gamma-RIIA by HIT Abs and resulted in significant increase of thrombin generation on the PLT surface. Using an ex vivo thrombosis model and multi-parameter assessment of thrombus formation, we observed that HIT Ab-induced procoagulant PLTs propagated formation of large PLT aggregates, leukocyte recruitment and most importantly, fibrin network generation. These prothrombotic conditions were prevented via the upregulation of PLTs intracellular cAMP with Iloprost, a clinically approved prostacyclin analogue. Additionally, the functional relevance of high P-Selectin and PS levels on procoagulant PLTs was dissected. While inhibition of P-Selectin did not affect thrombus formation, the specific blockade of PS with Lactadherin prevented HIT Ab-mediated thrombin generation and most importantly procoagulant PLT-mediated thrombus formation ex vivo. Taken together, our findings indicate that procoagulant PLTs are critical mediators of prothrombotic conditions in HIT. Upregulation of cAMP with Iloprost or PS targeting specifc therapeutics could be a promising approach to prevent thromboembolic events in HIT patients.\n\nKey points- HIT immune complexes drive procoagulant platelet formation\n- Phosphatidylserine blockade prevents HIT antibody-induced thrombus formation",

However, the spread of such clinically important antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) in the natural environment has not yet been well investigated. In this study, we investigated MDR aquatic bacteria in Vietnam. A carbapenem- and tigecycline-resistant Shewanella xiamenensis isolate NUITM-VS2 was obtained from urban drainage in Hanoi, Vietnam, in October 2021. S. xiamenensis NUITM-VS2 showed resistance to most antimicrobials tested, including tigecycline, tetracyclines, carbapenems, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolone, and aminoglycosides. Whole-genome analysis was performed by long- and short-read sequencing, resulting in the complete genome sequence consisting of one chromosome and five plasmid sequences. ARGs and plasmid replicons in the genome were detected using ResFinder with the custom ARG database, including all known tigecycline resistance genes, and PlasmidFinder, respectively. A 152.2-kb IncC plasmid, pNUITM-VS2_2, co-carried two mobile tigecycline resistance genes, tet(X4) and tmexC3.2D3.2-toprJ1. In addition, a 24.8-kb untypeable plasmid, pNUITM-VS2_4, carried the carbapenemase gene blaNDM-1. pNUITM-VS2_2 was transferred to Escherichia coli by conjugation, which simultaneously conferred high-level resistance against many antimicrobials, including tigecycline. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the detection of the mobile RND-type efflux pump gene cluster tmexCD-toprJ in Shewanella species.

Here we show that Arabidopsis DXO1 contributes to the efficient processing of rRNA precursors in both nucleolar/cytosol and chloroplast maturation pathways. However, processing defects in DXO1-deficient plants do not depend on the catalytic activity of the enzyme but rely on its plant-specific N-terminal extension. Our RNA sequencing analyses show that the dxo1 mutation deregulates the expression of many ribosomal protein genes, most likely leading to inefficient or delayed pre-rRNA maturation.

    "abstract": "Heat alters biology from molecular to ecological levels, but may also have unknown indirect effects. This includes the novel concept that animals exposed to abiotic stress can induce stress in naive receivers. Here, we provide a comprehensive picture of the molecular signatures of this process, by integrating multi-omic and phenotypic data. In individual zebrafish embryos, repeated heat peaks elicited both a molecular response and a burst of accelerated growth followed by a growth slow-down in concert with reduced responses to novel stimuli. Metabolomes of the media of heat treated vs. untreated embryos revealed candidate stress metabolites including sulphur-containing compounds and lipids. These stress metabolites elicited transcriptomic changes in naive receivers related to immune response, extracellular signalling, glycosaminoglycan/keratan sulphate, and lipid metabolism. Consequently, non heat-exposed receivers (exposed to stress metabolites only) experienced accelerated catch-up growth in concert with reduced swimming performance. The combination of heat and stress metabolites accelerated development the most, mediated by apelin signalling. Our results prove the concept of indirect heat-induced stress propagation towards naive receivers, inducing phenotypes comparable to those resulting from direct heat exposure, but utilising distinct molecular pathways. Group-exposing a non-laboratory zebrafish line, we independently confirm that the glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis-related gene chs1, and the mucus glycoprotein gene prg4a, functionally connected to the candidate stress metabolite classes sugars and phosphocholine, are differentially expressed in receivers. This hints at production of Schreckstoff-like cues in receivers, leading to further stress propagation within groups, which may have ecological and animal welfare implications for aquatic populations in a changing climate.\n\nSignificance StatementAquatic animals utilise chemicals to mediate adaptive behaviours. For instance, predated fish release chemical cues that elicit antipredatory responses in naive receivers. But whether abiotic factors such as heat likewise alter chemical communication has received little focus. Here, we uncover a novel dimension of chemical communication -- heat-stressed donors can induce stress in naive receivers. We show that heat activates molecular stress responses, leading to the release of distinct stress metabolite classes into the environment. These stress metabolites alter the transcriptome of receivers, resulting in faster development and hypoactivity. Heat combined with stress metabolites had the largest effect, highlighting that abiotic stress, experienced both directly and indirectly, can alter chemical communication and affect embryonic development.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=83 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/508176v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e44b4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b6878org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7c3bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15436bc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIWe elucidate the mechanism for a novel dimension of the heat stress response -- chemical communication from heat-stressed donors that induces stress in naive receivers -- constituting a positive feedback loop\nC_LIO_LIRepeated heat stress induces a cellular and cortisol stress response and alters the phenotype of zebrafish embryos\nC_LIO_LIHeat-stressed embryos release stress metabolites enriched in lipids and sulphur-containing organo-oxygen compounds\nC_LIO_LIIn combination, heat and stress metabolites induced 47% distinct differentially expressed genes, with many related to organ development\nC_LIO_LIThese stress metabolites alter the transcriptome and induce both faster development and hypoactivity in naive receivers, a similar response to that of heat stress itself\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Microbes shape their habitats through consuming resources, as well as actively producing and secreting diverse chemicals. These chemicals serve various niche-construction functions and can be considered \"public good\" for the community. Most microorganisms, for instance, release small molecules known as siderophores to scavenge irons from the extracellular environment. Despite being exploitable by cheaters, biosynthetic genes producing such molecules widely exist in nature, invoking active investigation on the possible mechanisms for producers to survive cheater invasion. In this work, we utilized the chemostat-typed model to demonstrate that the division of the iron by private and public siderophores can promote stable or dynamical coexistence between the cheater and \"partial cooperators\", an adaptive strategy with the production of both public and private siderophores. Further, our analysis revealed that when microbes not only consume but also produce resources, this type of \"resource partition model\" exhibit different stability criteria than that of the classical consumer resource model, allowing more complex systems dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Genes that undergo horizontal gene transfer (HGT) evolve in different genomic backgrounds as they move between hosts, in contrast to genes that evolve under strict vertical inheritance. Despite the ubiquity of HGT in microbial communities, the effects of host-switching on gene evolution have been understudied. Here, we present a novel framework to examine the consequences of host-switching on gene evolution by probing the existence and form of host-dependent mutational effects. We started exploring the effects of HGT on gene evolution by focusing on an antibiotic resistance gene (encoding a beta-lactamase) commonly found on conjugative plasmids in Enterobacteriaceae pathogens. By reconstructing the resistance landscape for a small set of mutationally connected alleles in three enteric species (Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae), we uncovered that the landscape topographies were largely aligned with very low levels of host-dependent mutational effects. By simulating gene evolution with and without HGT using the species-specific empirical landscapes, we found that evolutionary outcomes were similar despite HGT. These findings suggest that the adaptive evolution of a mobile gene in one species can translate to adaptation in another species. In such a case, vehicles of cross-species HGT such as plasmids enable a distributed form of genetic evolution across a bacterial community, where species can  crowdsource adaptation from other community members. The role of evolutionary crowdsourcing on the evolution of bacteria merits further investigation.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor Myc is critically important in driving cell proliferation, a function that is frequently dysregulated in cancer. To avoid this dysregulation Myc is tightly controlled by numerous layers of regulation. One such layer is the use of distal regulatory enhancers to drive Myc expression. Here, using chromosome conformation capture to examine B cells of the immune system in the first hours after their activation, we reveal a previously unidentified enhancer of myc. The interactivity of this enhancer coincides with a dramatic, but discrete, spike in Myc expression 3 hours post-activation. However, genetic deletion of this region, has little impact on Myc expression, Myc protein level or in vitro and in vivo cell proliferation. Examination of the enhancer deleted regulatory landscape suggests that enhancer redundancy likely sustains Myc expression. This work highlights not only the importance of temporally examining enhancers, but also the complexity and dynamics of the regulation of critical genes such as Myc.",

Here we show that in addition to producing histone-free DNA, BRG1 generates hemisome-like subnucleosomal particles containing the four core histones associated with 50-80 base pairs of DNA. Our genome-wide analysis indicates that BRG1 makes these particles by targeting and splitting fragile nucleosomes. In mouse embryonic stem cells, these subnucleosomes become an in vivo binding substrate for the master transcription factor OCT4 independently of the presence of OCT4 DNA motifs. At enhancers, the OCT4-subnucleosome interaction increases OCT4 occupancy and amplifies the genomic interval bound by OCT4 by up to one order of magnitude, compared to the region occupied on histone-free DNA. We suggest that BRG1-dependent subnucleosomes orchestrate an epigenetic mechanism that projects OCT4 function in chromatin opening beyond its DNA motifs.",

Understanding the function of specific cancer-TME interactions poses a major challenge due in part to the complexity of the in vivo microenvironment. Here we predict cancer-TME interactions from single cell transcriptomic maps of both human colorectal cancers (CRCs) and mouse CRC models, ask how these interactions are altered in established, long-term human tumor organoid (tumoroid) cultures, and functionally recapitulate human myeloid-carcinoma interactions in vitro. Tumoroid cultures suppress gene expression programs involved in promoting inflammation and immune cell migration through receptor-ligand interactions, providing a reductive platform for re-establishing carcinoma-immune cell interactions in vitro. Introduction of human monocyte-derived macrophages into tumoroid cultures instructs macrophages to acquire pro-tumorigenic gene expression programs similar to those observed in vivo. This includes hallmark induction of SPP1, encoding Osteopontin, an extracellular CD44 ligand with established oncogenic effects. Taken together, these findings offer a framework for understanding CRC-TME interactions and provide a reductionist tool for modeling specific aspects of these interactions.",

Here, we investigate this process in vivo during the recombinant overexpression of the spider silk-mimetic mini-spidroin NT2RepCT in Escherichia coli. The protein forms intracellular liquid-like condensates that shift to a solid-like state triggered by a decrease in their microenvironmental pH. These features are also maintained in the purified sample in vitro both in the presence of a molecular crowding agent mimicking the bacterial intracellular environment, and during a biomimetic extrusion process leading to fiber formation. Overall, we demonstrate that characterization of protein condensates inside E. coli could be used as a basis for selecting proteins for both materials applications and their fundamental structure-function studies.",

We found that Laminin-511, and dual canonical and non-canonical WNT activation followed by GSK3{beta} inhibition plus FGF8b, improved midbrain patterning. In addition, mDA neurogenesis and differentiation was enhanced by activation of liver X receptors and inhibition of fibroblast growth factor signaling. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a developmental dynamics similar to that of the endogenous human ventral midbrain and the emergence of high quality molecularly-defined midbrain cell types, including mDA neurons that become functional. Thus, our study identifies novel factors important for human midbrain development and opens the door for a future application of molecularly-defined hESC-derived midbrain cell types in Parkinsons disease.",

On entering the brain, microglia undergo in situ proliferation and eventually colonise the entire brain by the second and third postnatal weeks in mice. However, the intricate dynamics of their developmental expansion remain unclear. Here, we examine and characterise the proliferative dynamics of microglia during embryonic and postnatal development. Using complementary fate-mapping techniques, we demonstrate that the developmental colonisation of the brain by microglia is facilitated by clonal expansion of highly proliferative microglial progenitors that occupy spatial niches throughout the brain. We also find that the distribution of microglia switches from a clustered to a random pattern between embryonic and late postnatal development. Moreover, the developmental increase in microglia follows the proportional growth of the brain in an allometric manner with the density of microglia eventually stabilising when the mosaic distribution has been established. Overall, our findings offer insight into how the competition for space acts as a driving force for microglial colonisation by clonal expansion during development.",

Brain-state abnormalities affecting the striatum, such as ageing, often shift control towards autonomous--habit-like--behaviour, although the neural mechanisms responsible for this shift remain unknown. Here, combining instrumental conditioning with cell-specific functional mapping and manipulation in striatal neurons, we explored strategies that invigorate goal-directed action capacity in aged mice. In animals performing instrumental actions, D2- and D1-neurons of the aged striatum were engaged in a characteristically counterbalanced manner, something that related to the propensity to express autonomous behaviour. Long-lasting, cell-specific desensitisation of D2-neurons in aged transgenic mice recapitulated the uneven D2-to D1-neuron functional correspondence observed in young mice, an effect that enabled successful goal-directed action. Our findings contribute to the understanding of the neural bases of behavioural control and propose neural system interventions that enhance cognitive functioning in habit-prone brains.",

    "abstract": "Antibody affinity maturation enables adaptive immune responses to a wide range of pathogens. In some individuals broadly neutralizing antibodies develop to recognize rapidly mutating pathogens with extensive sequence diversity. Vaccine design for pathogens such as HIV-1 and influenza have therefore focused on recapitulating the natural affinity maturation process. Here, we determined structures of antibodies in complex with HIV-1 Envelope for all observed members and ancestral states of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody clonal B cell lineage. These structures track the development of neutralization breadth from the unmutated common ancestor and define affinity maturation at high spatial resolution. By elucidating contacts mediated by key mutations at different stages of antibody development we have identified sites on the epitope-paratope interface that are the focus of affinity optimization. Thus, our results identify bottlenecks on the path to natural affinity maturation and reveal solutions for these that will inform immunogen design aimed at eliciting a broadly neutralizing immune response by vaccination.\n\nSummarySomatic hypermutation drives affinity maturation of germline-encoded antibodies leading to the development of their pathogen neutralization function1. Rational vaccine design efforts that aim to recapitulate affinity maturation rely on information from antibodies elicited and matured during natural infection. High-throughput next generation sequencing and methods for tracing antibody development have allowed close monitoring of the antibody maturation process. Since maturation involves both affinity-enhancing and affinity-independent diversification, the precise effect of each observed mutation, their role in enhancing affinity to antigens, and the order in which the mutations accumulated are often unclear. These gaps in knowledge most acutely hinder efforts directed at difficult targets such as pan-HIV, pan-Influenza, and pan-Coronavirus vaccines. In HIV-1 infection, antibody maturation over several years is required to achieve neutralization breadth. Here, we determined structures of antibodies in complex with HIV-1 Envelope trimers for all observed members and ancestral states of a broadly neutralizing HIV-1 antibody clone to examine affinity maturation as neutralization breadth developed from the unmutated common ancestor. Structural determination of epitope-paratope interfaces revealed details of the contacts evolving over a timescale of several years. Structures along different branches of the clonal lineage elucidated differences in the branch that led to broad neutralization versus off-track paths that culminated in sub-optimal neutralization breadth. We further determined structures of the evolving Envelope revealing details of the virus-antibody co-evolution through visualization of how the virus constructs barriers to evade antibody-mediated neutralization and the mechanisms by which the developing antibody clone circumvents these barriers. Together, our structures provide a detailed time-resolved imagery of the affinity maturation process through atomic level descriptions of virus-antibody co-evolution leading to broad HIV neutralization. While the findings from our studies have direct relevance to HIV-1, the principles of affinity optimization and breadth development elucidated in our study should have broad relevance to other pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Statins appear to dramatically increase sepsis survival but only when treatment is initiated prior to hospitalization. This implies that statins exhibit a delayed-onset pro-survival benefit in septic patients that results in clinical futility of statin-therapy for patients already diagnosed with sepsis. Identification of mechanisms that contribute to increased sepsis-survival following statin-pretreatment may reveal novel therapeutic targets that do not suffer similar delayed onset benefits. Statins are used to treat hypercholesterolemia and function by inhibiting the production of the rate-limiting metabolite mevalonate. This indirectly inhibits the de novo synthesis of not only cholesterol but also isoprenoids that are involved in prenylation, the post-translational lipid modification of proteins. Mirroring clinical observations, chronic but not acute treatment with simvastatin significantly increased survival in a murine endotoxemia model. This was associated with reduced systemic granulocyte chemotaxis that occurred in a cell-intrinsic manner. In vitro modeling showed that simvastatin abolished chemoattractant responses and that this could be reversed by restoring geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) but not farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) nor cholesterol. Treatment with prenyltransferase inhibitors showed that chemoattractant responses were dependent on geranylgeranylation. Proteomic analysis of C15AlkOPP-prenylated proteins identified geranylgeranylated proteins involved in chemoattractant responses, including RHOA, RAC1, CDC42, and GNG2. Given the kinetic problems with initiating statin treatment after sepsis onset, prenyltransferases and geranylgeranylated proteins, such as RAC1 and GNG2, are promising interventional candidates for sepsis and critical inflammatory illness.",

    "abstract": "Experimental studies on the biology of malaria parasites have been mostly based on laboratory-adapted lines, but there is limited understanding of how these may differ from parasites in natural infections. Loss-of-function mutants have previously been shown to emerge during culture of some Plasmodium falciparum clinical isolates, in analyses that focused on single-genotype infections. The present study included a broader array of isolates, mostly representing multiple-genotype infections which are more typical in areas where malaria is highly endemic. Genome sequence data from multiple time points during several months of culture adaptation of 28 West African isolates were analysed, including previously available sequences along with new genome sequences from additional isolates and timepoints. Some genetically complex isolates eventually became fixed over time to single surviving genotypes in culture, whereas others retained diversity although proportions of genotypes varied over time. Drug-resistance allele frequencies did not show overall directional changes, suggesting that resistance-associated costs are not the main causes of fitness differences among parasites in culture. Loss-of-function mutants emerged during culture in several of the multiple-genotype isolates, affecting genes (including AP2-HS, EPAC and SRPK1) for which loss-of-function mutants were previously seen to emerge in single-genotype isolates. Parasite clones were derived by limiting dilution from six of the isolates, and sequencing identified de novo variants not detected in the bulk isolate sequences. Interestingly, most of these were nonsense mutants and frameshifts disrupting the coding sequence of EPAC, the gene with the largest number of independent nonsense mutants previously identified in laboratory-adapted lines. Analysis of Identity-By-Descent to explore relatedness among clones revealed co-occurring non-identical sibling parasites, illustrative of the natural genetic structure within parasite populations.",

All C. burnetii isolates encode either an autonomous replicating plasmid (QpH1, QpDG, QpRS, or QpDV) or QpRS-like chromosomally integrated plasmid sequences. The role of the ORFs present on these sequences is unknown. Here, the role of the ORFs encoded on QpH1 was investigated. Using a new C. burnetii shuttle vector (pB-TyrB-QpH1ori) we cured Nine Mile Phase II of QpH1. The {Delta}QpH1 strain grew normally in axenic media but had a significant growth defect in Vero cells, indicating QpH1 was important for C. burnetii virulence. We developed an inducible CRISPR interference system to examine the role of individual QpH1 plasmid genes. CRISPRi of cbuA0027 resulted in significant growth defects in axenic media and THP-1 cells. The cbuA0028/cbuA0027 operon encodes CBUA0028 and CBUA0027, which are homologous to the HigB2 toxin and HigA2 anti-toxin, respectively, from Vibrio cholerae. Consistent with toxin-antitoxin systems, overexpression of cbuA0028 resulted in a severe intracellular growth defect that was rescued by co-expression of cbuA0027. CBUA0028 inhibited protein translation. CBUA0027 bound the cbuA0028 promoter (PcbuA0028) and CBUA0028, with the resulting complex binding also PcbuA0028. In summary, our data indicates C. burnetii maintains an autonomously replicating plasmid because of a plasmid-based toxin-antitoxin system.",

    "abstract": "Green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenic laboratory animals (mice, rats, rabbits etc.) are commonly used in basic research for modelling human diseases, studying organ development, cell transfer during pregnancy or tissue engineering. The expression of the fluorescent protein can be either ubiquitous or tissue-specific, depending on the transgenic construct and the integration site of the transgene. Despite the wide applications, the data about the physiological parameters of GFP transgenic animals are limited. In most of the transgenic lines, GFP does not induce any detrimental effect, but GFP-induced conditions are also reported. Altered T-lymphopoiesis and low white blood cell (WBC) count were observed in human ubiquitin C promoter-driven GFP transgenic (UBC-GFP) mice due to latent stem cell defect. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of the Venus fluorescent protein on hematopoiesis and general health of transgenic rabbits, thus, hematology along with selected serum parameters were measured.",

    "abstract": "Neural proliferation zones mediate brain growth, and employ Delta/Notch signaling and HES/HER transcription factors to balance neural stem cell (NSC) maintenance and generation of progenitors and neurons. We investigated Notch-dependency and function of her genes in the thalamic proliferation zone of developing zebrafish larvae. Nine Notch-dependent genes, her2, her4.1-5, her12, her15.1-2, and two Notch-independent genes, her6, her9, are differentially expressed, and define distinct NSC and progenitor populations. her6 prominently executes patterning information to maintain NSCs and the zona limitans intrathalamica Shh signaling activity. her6, her9 double mutants reveal that Notch-independent her genes predominantly regulate NSC maintenance and transition into the progenitor pool. Surprisingly, combined deletion of all Notch-dependent her genes does not affect NSCs or progenitor formation. Combined genetic manipulation of up to eleven Notch-dependent and -independent her genes revealed that Notch-dependent her genes may regulate progenitor progression into neurogenesis, but not progenitor generation itself. The her gene network is partially redundant, with Notch-independent her genes better substituting for loss of Notch-dependent genes than vice versa. Together, her gene regulatory feedback loops and crossregulation contribute to the observed robustness of NSC maintenance.",

    "abstract": "Development of the human brain involves processes that are not seen in many other species, but can contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders (1-4). Cerebral organoids can be used to investigate neurodevelopmental disorders in a human context but are limited by variability and low throughput. We have developed the CRISPR-human organoids-scRNA-seq (CHOOSE) system that utilizes verified pairs of gRNAs, inducible CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic disruption, and single-cell transcriptomics for pooled loss-of-function screening in mosaic organoids. Genetic perturbations of 36 high-risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) genes related to transcriptional regulation allowed us to identify their effects on cell fate determination and discover developmental stages susceptible to ASD gene perturbations. We construct a developmental gene regulatory network (GRN) of cerebral organoids from single-cell multiomic data including transcriptome and chromatin modalities and identify ASD-associated and perturbation-enriched regulatory modules. We show that perturbing members of the BAF chromatin remodeling complex leads to an expanded population of ventral telencephalon progenitors. Specifically, the BAF subunit ARID1B controls the fate transitions of progenitors to oligodendrocyte precursor cells and interneurons, which we confirmed in patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived organoids. Our study paves the way for phenotypically characterizing disease susceptibility genes in human organoid models with cell type, developmental trajectory, and gene regulatory network readouts.",
