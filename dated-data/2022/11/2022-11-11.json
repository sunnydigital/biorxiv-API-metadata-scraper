    "abstract": "A new generation of scalable single cell whole genome sequencing (scWGS) methods allows unprecedented high resolution measurement of the evolutionary dynamics of cancer cell populations. Phylogenetic reconstruction is central to identifying sub-populations and distinguishing the mutational processes that gave rise to them. Existing phylogenetic tree building models do not scale to the tens of thousands of high resolution genomes achievable with current scWGS methods. We constructed a phylogenetic model and associated Bayesian inference procedure, sitka, specifically for scWGS data. The method is based on a novel phylogenetic encoding of copy number (CN) data, the sitka transformation, that simplifies the site dependencies induced by rearrangements while still forming a sound foundation to phylogenetic inference. The sitka transformation allows us to design novel scalable Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. Moreover, we introduce a novel point mutation calling method that incorporates the CN data and the underlying phylogenetic tree to overcome the low per-cell coverage of scWGS. We demonstrate our method on three single cell datasets, including a novel PDX series, and analyse the topological properties of the inferred trees.

    "abstract": "Hox genes are expressed during embryogenesis and determine the regional identity of animal bodies along the antero-posterior axis. However, they also function post-embryonically to sculpt fine-scale morphology. To better understand how Hox genes are integrated into post-embryonic gene regulatory networks, we further analysed the role and regulation of Ultrabithorax (Ubx) during leg development in Drosophila melanogaster. Ubx regulates several aspects of bristle and trichome patterning on the femurs of the second (T2) and third (T3) leg pairs. We found that repression of trichomes in the proximal posterior region of the T2 femur by Ubx is likely mediated by activation of the expression of microRNA-92a by this Hox protein. Furthermore, we identified a novel enhancer of Ubx that recapitulates the temporal and regional activity of this gene in T2 and T3 legs. We then used transcription factor binding motif analysis in regions of accessible chromatin in T2 leg cells to predict and functionally test transcription factors that may regulate the Ubx leg enhancer. We also tested the role of the Ubx co-factors Homothorax (Hth) and Extradenticle (Exd) in T2 and T3 femurs. We found several transcription factors that may act upstream or in concert with Ubx to modulate trichome patterning along the proximo-distal axis of developing femurs and that the repression of trichomes also requires Hth and Exd. Taken together our results provide insights into how Ubx is integrated into a postembryonic gene regulatory network to determine fine-scale leg morphology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe human microbiome comprises the microorganisms that inhabit the various locales of the human body and plays a vital role in human health. The composition of a microbial population is often quantified through measures of species diversity, which summarize the number of species along with their relative abundances into a single value. In a microbiome sample there will certainly be species missing from the target population which will affect the diversity estimates.\n\nMethodsWe employ a model based on the hierarchical Pitman-Yor (HPY) process to model the species abundance distributions over multiple populations. The model parameters are estimated using a Gibbs sampler. We also derive estimates of species diversity, conditional and unconditional on the observed data, as a function of the HPY parameters Finally, we derive a general formula for the Hill numbers in the HPY context.\n\nResultsWe show that the Gibbs sampler for the HPY model performs well in simulations. We also show that the conditional estimates of diversity from the HPY model improve over naive estimates when species are missing. Similarly the conditional HPY estimates tend to perform better than the naive estimates especially when the number of individuals sampled from a population is small.",

We test these assumptions using a dataset comprising 2,487 stomach contents of fish species across functional groups, feeding strategies, and prey availability in the environment over 12 years. Our results show that foraging shifts from trait-dependent prey selectivity to density dependence in warmer and more productive environments. This behavioral change leads to lower consumption efficiency as species shift away from their optimal trophic niche, undermining species persistence and biodiversity. By integrating this adaptive behavior into dynamic models, our study reveals that adaptive foraging yields higher risk profiles for ecosystems under global warming.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMachine learning models for predicting cell-type-specific transcription factor (TF) binding sites have become increasingly more accurate thanks to the increased availability of next-generation sequencing data and more standardized model evaluation criteria. However, knowledge transfer from data-rich to data-limited TFs and cell types remains crucial for improving TF binding prediction models because available binding labels are highly skewed towards a small collection of TFs and cell types. Transfer prediction of TF binding sites can potentially benefit from a multitask learning approach; however, existing methods typically use shallow single-task models to generate low-resolution predictions. Here we propose NetTIME, a multitask learning framework for predicting cell-type-specific transcription factor binding sites with base-pair resolution.\n\nResultsWe show that the multitask learning strategy for TF binding prediction is more efficient than the single-task approach due to the increased data availability. NetTIME trains high-dimensional embedding vectors to distinguish TF and cell-type identities. We show that this approach is critical for the success of the multitask learning strategy and allows our model to make accurate transfer predictions within and beyond the training panels of TFs and cell types. We additionally train a linear-chain conditional random field (CRF) to classify binding predictions and show that this CRF eliminates the need for setting a probability threshold and reduces classification noise. We compare our methods predictive performance with two state-of-the-art methods, Catchitt and Leopard, and show that our method outperforms previous methods under both supervised and transfer learning settings.\n\nAvailabilityNetTIME is freely available at https://github.com/ryi06/NetTIME and the code is also archived at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6994897\n\nContactrb133@nyu.edu",

    "abstract": "Genes act in concert with each other in specific contexts to perform their functions. Determining how these genes influence complex traits requires a mechanistic understanding of expression regulation across different conditions. It has been shown that this insight is critical for developing new therapies. In this regard, the role of individual genes in disease-relevant mechanisms can be hypothesized with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), which have represented a significant step forward in testing the mediating role of gene expression in GWAS associations. However, modern models of the architecture of complex traits predict that gene-gene interactions play a crucial role in disease origin and progression. Here we introduce PhenoPLIER, a computational approach that maps gene-trait associations and pharmacological perturbation data into a common latent representation for a joint analysis. This representation is based on modules of genes with similar expression patterns across the same conditions. We observed that diseases were significantly associated with gene modules expressed in relevant cell types, and our approach was accurate in predicting known drug-disease pairs and inferring mechanisms of action. Furthermore, using a CRISPR screen to analyze lipid regulation, we found that functionally important players lacked TWAS associations but were prioritized in trait-associated modules by PhenoPLIER. By incorporating groups of co-expressed genes, PhenoPLIER can contextualize genetic associations and reveal potential targets missed by single-gene strategies.",

    "abstract": "PD-L1, a transmembrane ligand for immune checkpoint receptor PD1, has been successfully targeted to activate an anti-tumor immune response in a variety of solid tumors, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite the success of targeting PD-L1, only about 20% of patients achieve a durable response. The reasons for the heterogeneity in response are not understood, although some molecular subtypes (e.g., mutant EGF receptor tumors) are generally poor responders. Although PD-L1 is best characterized as a transmembrane PD1 ligand, the emerging view is that PD-L1 has functions independent of activating PD1 signaling. It is not known whether these cell-intrinsic functions of PD-L1 are shared among non-transformed and transformed cells, if they vary among cancer molecular subtypes, or if they are impacted by anti-PD-L1 therapy. Here we use quantitative microscopy techniques and APEX2 proximity mapping to describe the behavior of PD-L1 and to identify PD-L1s proximal proteome in human lung epithelial cells. Our data reveal growth factor control of PD-L1 recycling as a mechanism for acute and reversible regulation of PD-L1 density on the plasma membrane. In addition, we describe novel PD-L1 biology restricted to mutant EGFR cells. Anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment of mutant EGFR cells perturbs cell intrinsic PD-L1 functions, leading to reduced cell migration, increased half-life of EGFR and increased extracellular vesicle biogenesis, whereas anti-PD-L1 antibody does not induce these changes in wild type EGFR cells. These specific effects in mutant EGFR cells might contribute to the poor anti-PD-L1 response of mutant EGFR tumors.",

    "abstract": "Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) Mass Spectrometry (MS) is a reference method for microbial identification and it can be used to predict Antibiotic Resistance (AR) when combined with artificial intelligence methods. However, current solutions need time-costly preprocessing steps, are difficult to reproduce due to hyperparameter tuning, are hardly interpretable, and do not pay attention to epidemiological differences inherent to data coming from different centres, which can be critical.\n\nWe propose using a multi-view heterogeneous Bayesian model (KSSHIBA) for the prediction of AR using MALDI-TOF MS data together with their epidemiological differences. KSSHIBA is the first model that removes the ad-hoc preprocessing steps that work with raw MALDI-TOF data. In addition, due to its Bayesian probabilistic nature, it does not require hyperparameter tuning, provides interpretable results, and allows exploiting local epidemiological differences between data sources. To test the proposal, we used data from 402 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates coming from two different domains and 20 different hospitals located in Spain and Portugal. KSSHIBA outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in antibiotic susceptibility prediction, obtaining a 0.78 AUC score in Wild Type classification and a 0.90 AUC score in Extended-Spectrum Beta-Lactamases (ESBL)+Carbapenemases (CP)-producers. The proposal consistently removes the need for ad-hoc preprocessing by working with raw MALDI-TOF data, which, in turn, reduces the time needed to obtain the results of the resistance mechanism in microbiological laboratories.

Genomic data is easily accessible and available from public genomic repositories allowing the biomedical community to effectively share the omics datasets. However, improperly annotated or incomplete metadata accompanying the raw omics data can negatively impact the utility of shared data for secondary analysis. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis under 137 studies over 18,559 samples across six therapeutics fields to assess the completeness of metadata accompanying omics studies in both publication and its related online repositories across and make observations about how the process of data sharing could be made reliable. This analysis involved finding studies based on the six therapeutic fields, that are Alzheimers disease, acute myeloid leukemia, cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, and tuberculosis. We carefully examined the availability of metadata over nine clinical variables, that included disease condition, age, organism, sex, tissue type, ethnicity, country, mortality, and clinical severity. By comparing the metadata availability in both original publications and online repositories, we observed discrepancies in sharing the metadata. We determine that the overall availability of metadata is 72.8%, where the most complete reported phenotypes are disease condition and organism, and the least is mortality. Additionally, we examined the completeness of metadata reported separately in original publications and online repositories. The completeness of metadata from the original publication across the nine clinical phenotypes is 71.1%. In contrast, the overall completeness of metadata information from the public repositories is 48.6%. Our study is the first one to systematically assess the completeness of metadata accompanying raw data across a large number of studies and phenotypes and opens a crucial discussion about solutions to improve completeness and accessibility of metadata accompanying omics studies.",

However, our understanding of how tooth classes have evolved and diversified remains limited. Here, we use the evolutionary radiation of noctilionoid bats, the most diverse clade of mammals in terms of diet type, as a model system to show how the tooth developmental program evolved during the adaptation to new diet types. We combined morphological, developmental, cellular, and modeling approaches, to investigate the developmental differences between two tooth classes, molars and premolars and the mechanisms driving their diversification. We demonstrate that tooth classes develop through independent developmental cascades that deviate from classical models. Then we showed that the dramatic diversification of tooth number and size is driven by the modulation of the growth rate of the jaw, explaining the rapid gain/loss of teeth during the evolution of this clade. Finally, we propose a mathematical model that recapitulates the successive appearance of tooth buds and supports the hypothesis that growth acts as a key driver of the evolution of tooth number and size by tinkering with reaction/diffusion processes. Our results demonstrate developmental independence between mammalian tooth classes and provide a mechanism to explain their rapid diversification. More broadly, these results reveal how simple modifications of one developmental mechanism by another can drive the evolution of repeated structures during adaptive radiations.",

    "abstract": "The rise in wildfire frequency and severity across the globe has increased interest in secondary succession. However, despite the role of soil microbial communities in controlling biogeochemical cycling and their role in the regeneration of post-fire vegetation, the lack of measurements immediately post-fire and at high temporal resolution has limited understanding of microbial secondary succession. To fill this knowledge gap, we sampled soils at 17, 25, 34, 67, 95, 131, 187, 286, and 376 days after a southern California wildfire in fire-adapted chaparral shrublands. We assessed bacterial and fungal biomass with qPCR of 16S and 18S and richness and composition with Illumina MiSeq sequencing of 16S and ITS2 amplicons. Fire severely reduced bacterial biomass by 47%, bacterial richness by 46%, fungal biomass by 86%, and fungal richness by 68%. The burned bacterial and fungal communities experienced rapid succession, with 5-6 compositional turnover periods. Analogous to plants, turnover was driven by \"fire-loving\" pyrophilous microbes, many of which have been previously found in forests worldwide and changed markedly in abundance over time. Fungal secondary succession was initiated by the Basidiomycete yeast Geminibasidium, which traded off against the filamentous Ascomycetes Pyronema, Aspergillus, and Penicillium. For bacteria, the Proteobacteria Massilia dominated all year, but the Firmicute Bacillus and Proteobacteria Noviherbaspirillum increased in abundance over time. Our high-resolution temporal sampling allowed us to capture post-fire microbial secondary successional dynamics and suggest that putative tradeoffs in thermotolerance, colonization, and competition among dominant pyrophilous microbes control microbial succession with possible implications for ecosystem function.",

    "abstract": "We show that inactivating AMPK in vivo in a genetic model of medulloblastoma depletes tumor stem cell populations and slows tumor progression. Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant pediatric brain tumor, grows as heterogenous communities comprising diverse types of tumor and stromal cells. Previously, we showed that different populations in medulloblastomas show different sensitivities to specific targeted therapies. To determine if specific populations depend on AMPK, we analyzed mice with AMPK-inactivated medulloblastomas. We engineered mice with conditional deletion of the AMPK catalytic subunits Prkaa1 and Prkaa2 and conditional expression SmoM2, an oncogenic Smo allele that hyperactivates Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) signaling. We compared these medulloblastomas to SmoM2-driven medulloblastomas in AMPK-intact mice. AMPK-inactivation slowed tumor growth and progression, allowing longer event-free survival (EFS). scRNA-seq showed that AMPK inactivation altered cellular heterogeneity, increasing differentiation, decreasing tumor stem cell populations and reducing glio-neuronal multipotency. Surprisingly, AMPK-inactivated tumors showed decreased mTORC1 activation and Hk2 expression. Genetic Hk2 deletion in SmoM2-medulloblastomas similarly decreased stem cell populations, implicating reduced aerobic glycolysis in the tumor-suppressive effect of AMPK inactivation. Our results show that AMPK inactivation impairs tumor growth through mechanisms that disproportionately affect tumor stem cell populations that have proved refractory to conventional therapies.",

    "abstract": "Single spikes can trigger repeatable firing sequences in cortical networks. The mechanisms that support reliable propagation of activity from such small events and their functional consequences remain unclear. By constraining a recurrent network model with experimental statistics from turtle cortex, we generate reliable and temporally precise sequences from single spike triggers. We find that rare strong connections support sequence propagation, while dense weak connections modulate propagation reliability. We identify sections of sequences corresponding to divergent branches of strongly connected neurons which can be selectively gated. Applying eternal inputs to specific neurons in the sparse backbone of strong connections can effectively control propagation and route activity within the network. Finally, we demonstrate that concurrent sequences interact reliably, generating a highly combinatorial space of sequence activations. Our results reveal the impact of individual spikes in cortical circuits, detailing how repeatable sequences of activity can be triggered, sustained, and controlled during cortical computations.",

Pivotal to this coordination is the appropriate partitioning of cellular resources between protein synthesis via translation and the metabolism needed to sustain it. Here, we extend a low-dimensional allocation model to describe the dynamic control of this resource partitioning. At the core of this regulation is the optimal coordination of metabolic and translational fluxes, mechanistically achieved via the perception of charged- and uncharged-tRNA turnover. An extensive comparison with {approx} 60 data sets from Escherichia coli establishes this regulatory mechanisms biological veracity and demonstrates that a remarkably wide range of growth phenomena in and out of steady state can be predicted with quantitative accuracy. This predictive power, achieved with only a few biological parameters, cements the preeminent importance of optimal flux regulation across conditions and establishes low-dimensional allocation models as an ideal physiological framework to interrogate the dynamics of growth, competition, and adaptation in complex and ever-changing environments.",

And what governs how neural activity evolves during abstract knowledge acquisition? To investigate these questions, we consider a circuit model that learns to map sensory input to abstract classes via gradient descent synaptic plasticity. We focus on typical neuroscience tasks (simple, and context-dependent, categorization), and study how both synaptic connectivity and neural activity evolve during learning. To make contact with the current generation of experiments, we analyze activity via standard measures such as selectivity, correlations, and tuning symmetry. We find that the model is able to recapitulate experimental observations, including seemingly disparate ones. We determine how, in the model, the behaviour of these measures depends on details of the circuit and the task. These dependencies make experimentally-testable predictions about the circuitry supporting abstract knowledge acquisition in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The {varepsilon}4 variant of apolipoprotein E (APOE) is the strongest and most common genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). While the mechanism of conveyed risk is incompletely understood, promotion of inflammation, dysregulated metabolism, and protein misfolding and aggregation are contributors to accelerating disease. Here we determined the concurrent effects of systemic metabolic changes and brain inflammation in young (3-month-old) and aged (18-month-old) male and female mice carrying the APOE4 gene. Using functional metabolic assays alongside multivariate modeling of hippocampal cytokine levels, we found that brain cytokine signatures are predictive of systemic metabolic outcomes, independent of AD proteinopathies. Male and female mice each produce different cytokine signatures as they age and as their systemic metabolic phenotype declines, and these signatures are APOE genotype dependent. Ours is the first study to identify a quantitative and predictive link between systemic metabolism and specific pathological cytokine signatures in the brain. Our results highlight the effects of APOE4 beyond the brain and suggest the potential for bi-directional influence of risk factors in the brain and periphery.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=123 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/480074v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (43K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5865d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@185a0e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d2e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b27318_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Here, we assess the causal evidence supporting this relationship in the healthy population, using an umbrella review of meta-analyses limited to randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Despite most of the 24 reviewed meta-analyses reporting a positive overall effect, our assessment reveals evidence of low statistical power in the primary RCTs, selective inclusion of studies, publication bias, and large variation in combinations of preprocessing and analytic decisions. In addition, our meta-analysis of all the primary RCTs included in the revised meta-analyses shows small exercise-related benefits (d = 0.22, 95% CI [0.16, 0.28]) that became substantially smaller after accounting for key moderators (i.e., active control and baseline differences; d = 0.13, 95% CI [0.07, 0.20), and negligible after correcting for publication bias (d = 0.05, 95% CrI [-0.09, 0.14]).

Herein, we utilized single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a single-cell atlas of the murine uterus, decidua, and cervix in a model of infection-induced preterm labor. We show that preterm labor affects the transcriptomic profiles of specific immune and non-immune cell subsets. Shared and tissue-specific gene expression signatures were identified among affected cells. Importantly, determination of intercellular communications implicates specific cell types preterm labor-associated signaling pathways across tissues. Last, in silico comparison of murine and human uterine cell-cell interactions reveals conserved signaling pathways implicated in labor.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveTemporal interference stimulation (TIS) was proposed as a non-invasive, focal, and steerable deep brain stimulation method. However, the mechanisms underlying experimentally-observed suprathreshold TIS effects are unknown, and prior simulation studies had limitations in the representations of the TIS electric field (E-field) and cerebral neurons. We examined the E-field and neural response characteristics for TIS and related transcranial alternating current stimulation modalities.\n\nApproachUsing the uniform-field approximation, we simulated a range of stimulation parameters in biophysically realistic model cortical neurons, including different orientations, frequencies, amplitude ratios, amplitude modulation, and phase difference of the E-fields, and obtained thresholds for both activation and conduction block.\n\nMain resultsFor two E-fields with similar amplitudes (representative of E-field distributions at the target region), TIS generated an amplitude-modulated total E-field. Due to the phase difference of the individual E-fields, the total TIS E-field vector also exhibited rotation where the orientations of the two E-fields were not aligned (generally also at the target region). TIS activation thresholds (75-230 V/m) were similar to those of high-frequency stimulation with or without modulation and/or rotation. For E-field dominated by the high-frequency carrier and with minimal amplitude modulation and/or rotation (typically outside the target region), TIS was less effective at activation and more effective at block. Unlike amplitude-modulated high-frequency stimulation, TIS generated conduction block with some orientations and amplitude ratios of individual E-field at very high amplitudes of the total E-field (>1700 V/m).\n\nSignificanceThe complex 3D properties of the TIS E-fields should be accounted for in computational and experimental studies. The mechanisms of suprathreshold cortical TIS appear to involve neural activity block and periodic activation or onset response, consistent with computational studies of peripheral axons. These phenomena occur at E-field strengths too high to be delivered tolerably through scalp electrodes and may inhibit endogenous activity in off-target regions, suggesting limited significance of suprathreshold TIS.",

However, existing explainability approaches typically generate a point estimate of importance and do not provide insight into the degree of uncertainty associated with explanations. In this study, we present a novel approach for estimating explanation uncertainty for convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on neuroimaging data. We train a CNN for classification of individuals with schizophrenia (SZs) and controls (HCs) using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) data. We apply Monte Carlo batch normalization (MCBN) and generate an explanation following each iteration using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP). We then examine whether the resulting distribution of explanations differs between SZs and HCs and examine the relationship between MCBN-based LRP explanations and regular LRP explanations. We find a number of significant differences in LRP relevance for SZs and HCs and find that traditional LRP values frequently diverge from the MCBN relevance distribution. This study provides a novel approach for obtaining insight into the level of uncertainty associated with gradient-based explanations in neuroimaging and represents a significant step towards increasing reliability of explainable deep learning methods within a clinical setting.",

    "abstract": "Mutation is the ultimate source of genetic variation. Mutation rate variability has been observed within plant genomes, but the underlying mechanisms have been unclear. We previously found that mutations occur less often in functionally constrained regions of the genome in Arabidopsis thaliana and that this mutation rate reduction is predicted by H3K4me1, a histone modification found in the gene bodies of actively expressed and evolutionarily conserved genes in plants. We reanalyzed de novo germline single base substitutions in fast neutron irradiated mutation accumulation lines in Kitaake rice (Oryza sativa) and found the same reduction in mutations associated with H3K4me1, gene bodies, and constrained genes as in A. thaliana, suggesting conserved mechanisms for mutation reduction in plants. Here, we characterize a model of targeted DNA repair to explain these observations; PDS5C and MSH6 DNA repair-related proteins target H3K4me1 through their Tudor domains, resulting in nearby DNA experiencing elevated repair. Experimental data and in-silico modeling support the high affinity of the Tudor domain for H3K4me1 in both proteins, and that this affinity is conserved between plant species. ChIP-seq data from PDS5C confirms its localization to conserved and low mutation rate genome regions. Somatic and germline mutations observed by deep sequencing of wild-type and MSH6 knockout lines confirm that MSH6 preferentially repairs gene bodies and H3K4me1-enriched regions. These findings inspire further research to characterize the origins of mechanisms of targeted DNA repair in eukaryotes and their consequences on tuning the evolutionary trajectories of genomes.",

Generative statistical modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm for designing amino acid sequences, including in particular models and embedding methods borrowed from Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, most approaches target single proteins or protein domains, and do not take into account any functional specificity or interaction with the context. To extend beyond current computational strategies, we develop a method for generating protein domain sequences intended to interact with another protein domain. Using data from natural multi-domain proteins, we cast the problem as a translation problem from a given interactor domain to the new domain to be generated, i.e. we generate artificial partner sequences conditional on an input sequence.\n\nResultsEvaluating our models quality using diverse metrics, in part related to distinct biological questions, we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art shallow auto-regressive strategies. We also explore the possibility of fine-tuning pre-trained large language models for the same task and of using Alphafold 2 for assessing the quality of sampled sequences.",

    "abstract": "Dimensionality reduction and visualization play an important role in biological data analysis, such as data interpretation of single-cell RNA sequence (scRNA-seq). It is desired to have a visualization method that can not only be applicable to various application scenarios, including cell clustering and trajectory inference, but also satisfy a variety of technical requirements, especially the ability to preserve inherent structure of data and handle with batch effects. However, no existing methods can accommodate these requirements in a unified framework. In this paper, we propose a general visualization method, deep visualization (DV), that possesses the ability to preserve inherent structure of data and handle batch effects and is applicable to a variety of datasets from different application domains and dataset scales. The method embeds a given dataset into a 2- or 3-dimensional visualization space, with either a Euclidean or hyperbolic metric depending on a specified task type with type static (at a time point) or dynamic (at a sequence of time points) scRNA-seq data, respectively. Specifically, DV learns a structure graph to describe the relationships between data samples, transforms the data into visualization space while preserving the geometric structure of the data and correcting batch effects in an end-to-end manner. The experimental results on nine datasets in complex tissue from human patients or animal development demonstrate the competitiveness of DV in discovering complex cellular relations, uncovering temporal trajectories, and addressing complex batch factors. We also provide a preliminary attempt to pre-train a DV model for visualization of new incoming data.",

    "abstract": "Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic condition characterized by features of accelerated aging and a life expectancy of about 14 years. HGPS is commonly caused by a point mutation in the LMNA gene which codes for lamin A, an essential component of the nuclear lamina. The HGPS mutation alters splicing of the LMNA transcript, leading to a truncated, farnesylated form of lamin A termed \"progerin.\" HGPS is associated with accumulation of genomic DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), suggesting altered DNA repair. DSB repair normally occurs by either homologous recombination (HR), an accurate, templated form of repair, or by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), an error-prone non-templated rejoining of DNA ends. Some NHEJ events occur via high-fidelity joining of DNA ends and we refer to such events as precise ligation (PL). Previously, we reported that expression of progerin correlated with increased NHEJ relative to HR. We now report on progerins impact on the nature of DNA end-joining. We used a model system involving a DNA end-joining reporter substrate integrated into the genome of cultured thymidine kinase-deficient mouse fibroblasts. Some cells were engineered to express progerin. DSBs were induced in the substrate through expression of endonuclease I-SceI, and DSB repair events were recovered through selection for thymidine kinase function. Progerin expression correlated with a significant shift away from PL and toward error-prone NHEJ. Our work suggests that progerin suppresses interactions between complementary sequences at DNA termini, shifting DSB repair toward low-fidelity DNA end-joining and perhaps contributing to aging through compromised genome stability.",

    "abstract": "Adipose tissue is essential for energy homeostasis, with mitochondria having a central role in its function. Mitochondria-mediated white adipose tissue dysfunction has been linked to several metabolic disorders in humans but surprisingly little is known about natural variation in mitochondrial function in wild animal populations, and its evolutionary significance. Early sexual maturation (low age-at-maturity) in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is promoted by higher adiposity and has a strong genetic association with the vgll3 locus. This makes Atlantic salmon a convenient wild model to study the potential role of mitochondria-mediated adipose tissue processes in relation to the timing of maturation. Yet, mitochondrial respiration has not been measured in the adipose tissue in fish, and the lack of data is restricting the development of informed hypotheses. Here, using 13 Atlantic salmon individuals reared in common-garden conditions, we first verified the feasibility of measuring mitochondrial respiration in the adipose tissue. As expected, the respiration level was generally low, but nonetheless we successfully quantified its biological variation in the adipose tissue. Next, we analysed the potential association of mitochondrial respiration with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, adipocyte size, sex, and the vgll3 genotype. Despite low samples sizes, mitochondrial respiration, leak respiration, and coupling capacity (P/E ratio) were marginally significantly decreased in immature females carrying with the vgll3 early maturation compared to the alternative genotype. Based on these results, we suggested two new hypotheses on how the coupling capacity of oxidative phosphorylation could be linked with the timing of maturation via adiposity and pave the way to study the mechanistic relationships between life-history variation and mitochondrial bioenergetics in wild populations.",

    "abstract": "Collateral arteries act as natural bypasses which re-route blood flow to ischemic regions and facilitate tissue regeneration. In an injured heart, neonatal artery endothelial cells orchestrate a systematic series of cellular events, which includes their outward migration, proliferation, and coalescence into fully functional collateral arteries. This process, called Artery Reassembly, aids complete cardiac regeneration in neonatal hearts, but is absent in adults. The reason for this age-dependent disparity in artery cell response is completely unknown. In this study, we investigated if regenerative potential of coronary arteries, like in cardiomyocytes, is dictated by their ability to de-differentiate. We performed single cell RNA sequencing of coronary endothelial cells and identified differences in molecular profiles of neonatal and adult endothelial cells. Neonates show significant increase in actively cycling artery cells that expressed prominent de-differentiation markers. Using both, in silico pathway analyses and in vivo experiments, we show that cell cycle re-entry of pre-existing artery cells, subsequent collateral artery formation and cardiac function is dependent on arterial VegfR2. This sub-population of de-differentiated and proliferating artery cells is absent in non-regenerative P7 or adult hearts. Together, our data indicate that adult artery endothelial cells fail to drive collateral artery development due to their limited ability to de-differentiate and proliferate.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis relates to the brain resilience and is reduced in Alzheimers disease (AD). Restoring healthy levels of neurogenesis could have beneficial effects for coping with neurodegeneration. However, molecular mechanisms that could enhance neurogenesis from astroglial progenitors in AD pathology are largely unknown. We used lentiviruses to express Ngfr in the hippocampus of the APP/PS1dE9 mouse model of AD, histologically analyzed the changes in proliferation of neural stem cells and neurogenesis; performed single-cell transcriptomics, spatial proteomics, and functional knockdown studies. We found that expression of Ngfr, a neurogenic determinant in pathology-induced neuroregeneration in zebrafish, stimulated proliferative and neurogenic outcome in the APP/PS1dE9 AD mouse model. Ngfr suppressed reactive astrocyte marker Lipocalin-2 (Lcn2) in astroglia. Blockage of Lcn2 receptor, Slc22a17, recapitulated the neurogenic effects of NGFR, and long-term Ngfr expression reduced amyloid plaques and Tau phosphorylation. Furthermore, immunostaining on postmortem human hippocampi with AD or primary age-related Tauopathy and 3D human astroglial cultures showed that elevated LCN2 levels correlate with gliosis. By comparing transcriptional changes in mouse hippocampus, zebrafish brain, and human AD brains in terms of cell intrinsic differential gene expression analyses as well as weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we observed common potential downstream effectors of NGFR signaling, C4B and PFKP, that are relevant to AD. Our study links the regulatory role of an autocrine molecular mechanism in astroglia to the neurogenic ability and modulatory effects on amyloid and tau phosphorylation, opening new research avenues and suggesting that neurogenesis-oriented therapeutic approaches could be a potential clinical intervention for AD.",

    "abstract": "The ability of synapses to maintain physiological levels of evoked neurotransmission is essential for neuronal stability. A variety of perturbations can disrupt neurotransmission, but synapses often compensate for disruptions and work to stabilize activity levels, using forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) is one such mechanism. PHP is expressed at the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse, as well as other NMJs. In PHP, presynaptic neurotransmitter release increases to offset the effects of impairing muscle transmitter receptors. Prior Drosophila work has studied PHP using different ways to perturb muscle receptor function - either acutely (using pharmacology) or chronically (using genetics). Some of our prior data suggested that cytoplasmic calcium signaling was important for expression of PHP after genetic impairment of glutamate receptors. Here we followed up on that observation. We used a combination of transgenic Drosophila RNA interference and overexpression lines, along with NMJ electrophysiology, synapse imaging, and pharmacology to test if regulators of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin are necessary for the normal expression of PHP. We found that either pre- or postsynaptic dysregulation of a Drosophila gene regulating calcineurin, sarah (sra), blocks PHP. Tissue-specific manipulations showed that either increases or decreases in sra expression are detrimental to PHP. Additionally, pharmacologically and genetically induced forms of expression of PHP are functionally separable depending entirely upon which sra genetic manipulation is used. Surprisingly, dual-tissue pre- and postsynaptic sra knockdown or overexpression can ameliorate PHP blocks revealed in single-tissue experiments. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of calcineurin corroborated this latter finding. Our results suggest tight calcineurin regulation is needed across multiple tissue types to stabilize peripheral synaptic outputs.",

    "abstract": "Clinically licensed COVID-19 vaccines ameliorate viral infection by inducing vaccinee production of neutralizing antibodies that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein to inhibit viral cellular entry (Walsh et al., 2020; Baden et al., 2021), however the clinical effectiveness of these vaccines is transitory as viral variants arise that escape antibody neutralization (Tregoning et al., 2021; Willett et al., 2022). Vaccines that solely rely upon a T cell response to combat viral infection could be transformational because they can be based on highly conserved short peptide epitopes that hold the potential for pan-variant immunity, but a mRNA-LNP T cell vaccine has not been shown to be sufficient for effective antiviral prophylaxis. Here we show that a mRNA-LNP vaccine based on highly conserved short peptide epitopes activates a CD8+ and CD4+ T cell response that prevents mortality in HLA-A*02:01 transgenic mice infected with the SARS-CoV-2 Beta variant of concern (B.1.351). In mice vaccinated with the T cell vaccine, 24% of the nucleated cells in lung were CD8+ T cells on day 7 post infection. This was 5.5 times more CD8+ T cell infiltration of the lungs in response to infection compared to the Pfizer-BioNTech Comirnaty(R) vaccine. Between days 2 and 7 post infection, the number of CD8+ T cells in the lung increased in mice vaccinated with the T cell vaccine and decreased in mice vaccinated with Comirnaty(R). The T cell vaccine did not produce neutralizing antibodies, and thus our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 viral infection can be controlled by a T cell response alone. Our results suggest that further study is merited for pan-variant T cell vaccines, and that T cell vaccines may be relevant for individuals that cannot produce neutralizing antibodies or to help mitigate Long COVID.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial plasmids play a major role in the spread of antibiotic resistance genes. However, their characterization via DNA sequencing suffers from the low abundance of plasmid DNA in those samples. Although sample preparation methods can enrich the proportion of plasmid DNA before sequencing, these methods are expensive and laborious, and they might introduce a bias by enriching only for specific plasmid DNA sequences. Nanopore adaptive sampling could overcome these issues by rejecting uninteresting DNA molecules during the sequencing process. In this study, we assess the application of adaptive sampling for the enrichment of low-abundant plasmids in known bacterial isolates using two different adaptive sampling tools. We show that a significant enrichment can be achieved even on expired flow cells. By applying adaptive sampling, we also improve the quality of de novo plasmid assemblies and reduce the sequencing time. However, our experiments also highlight issues with adaptive sampling if target and non-target sequences span similar regions.",

    "abstract": "FtsZ, the tubulin homolog essential for bacterial cell division, assembles as Z-ring at the division site, and directs peptidoglycan synthesis by treadmilling. A key unanswered question is how FtsZ achieves its kinetic polarity that drives treadmilling. To obtain insights into fundamental features of FtsZ assembly dynamics independent of peptidoglycan synthesis, we report the characterization of FtsZ from the cell wall-less bacteria, Spiroplasma melliferum (SmFtsZ). SmFtsZ is a slower GTPase and has higher critical concentration (CC) for polymerization compared to Escherichia coli FtsZ (EcFtsZ). Analysis of the crystal structures of FtsZ structures reveal that the interaction of gamma phosphate of the nucleotide with the T3 loop leads to a peptide flip at Gly71. We propose that the flipped peptide conformation results in a key interaction that facilitates preferential binding of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of a GTP-bound FtsZ monomer to the C-terminal domain (CTD) exposed end of FtsZ filament. In FtsZs, a conformational switch from R- to T-state favors polymerization. We identified a residue, Phe224, located at the interdomain cleft of SmFtsZ, which is crucial for R- to T-state transition. The mutation F224M in SmFtsZ cleft resulted in higher GTPase activity and lower CC, whereas the corresponding M225F in EcFtsZ resulted in cell division defects in E. coli. Our results demonstrate that relative rotation of the domains is a rate-limiting step of polymerization. This step, in addition to the GTP-dependence of the T3 loop conformation, slows down the addition of monomers to the NTD-exposed end of filament in comparison to CTD end, thus explaining kinetic polarity.",

In vitro, Hcfc1 regulates neural precursor (NPCs) proliferation and number, which has been validated in zebrafish. However, conditional deletion of Hcfc1 in Nkx2.1+ NPCs increased cell death, reduced Gfap expression, and reduced numbers of GABAergic neurons. Thus, the role of HCFC1 in brain development is not completely understood. Recently, knock-in of both a cblX (HCFC1) and cblX-like (THAP11) allele were created in mice. Knock-in of the cblX-like allele was associated with increased expression of proteins required for ribosome biogenesis. However, the brain phenotypes were not comprehensively studied due to sub-viability and therefore, a mechanism underlying increased ribosome biogenesis was not described. We used a missense, a nonsense, and two conditional zebrafish alleles to further elucidate this mechanism during brain development. We observed contrasting phenotypes at the level of Akt/mTor activation, the number of radial glial cells, and the expression of two downstream target genes of HCFC1, asxl1 and ywhab. Despite these divergent phenotypes, each allele studied demonstrates with a high degree of face validity when compared to the phenotypes reported in the literature. Collectively, these data suggest that individual mutations in the HCFC1 protein result in differential mTor activity which is associated with contrasting cellular phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, affect males more than females. Genomic mechanisms enhancing risk in males may contribute to this sex-bias. The ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene (Ube3a) exerts pleiotropic effects on cellular homeostasis via control of protein turnover and by acting as transcriptional coactivator with steroid hormone receptors. Overdosage of Ube3a via duplication or triplication of chromosomal region 15q11-13 causes 1-2% of autistic cases. Here, we test the hypothesis that increased dosage of Ube3a may influence autism-relevant phenotypes in a sex-biased manner. We report robust sex-biasing effects on brain connectomics and repetitive behaviors in mice with extra copies of Ube3a. These effects were associated with a profound transcriptional dysregulation of several known autism-associated genes (e.g., FMR1, SCN2A, PTEN, MEF2C, SHANK3, TSC2) as well as differentially-expressed genes identified in human 15q duplication and in autistic patients. Notably, increased Ube3a dosage also affects multiple sex-relevant mechanisms, including genes on the X chromosome, genes influenced by sex steroid hormones, downstream targets of the androgen and estrogen receptors, or genes that are sex-differentially regulated by transcription factors. These results suggest that Ube3a overdosage can critically contribute to sex-bias in neurodevelopmental conditions via influence on sex-differential mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Targeting metabolic vulnerabilities has been proposed as a therapeutic strategy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Here, we analyzed metabolism in patient-derived xenografts (tumorgrafts) from diverse forms of RCC. Tumorgrafts from VHL-mutant clear cell RCC (ccRCC) retained metabolic features of human ccRCC and engage in oxidative and reductive glutamine metabolism. We used several approaches to suppress glutamine metabolism and test the effect on tumor growth. Genetic silencing of isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 or -2 impaired reductive labeling of TCA cycle intermediates and suppressed tumor growth. Glutaminase inhibition resulted in modest growth suppression and variable effects on glutamine metabolism in vivo. Infusions with [amide-15N]glutamine revealed persistent amidotransferase activity during glutaminase inhibition, and blocking these activities with the amidotransferase inhibitor JHU-083 also reduced tumor growth. We conclude that ccRCC tumorgrafts catabolize glutamine via multiple pathways, perhaps explaining why it has been challenging to achieve therapeutic responses in patients by inhibiting glutaminase.\n\nTeaserGlutamine fuels the TCA cycle and amidotransferase pathways in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Despite advances in molecular profiling, therapeutic development has been hindered by the inability to identify and target tumour-specific mechanisms without consequence to healthy tissue. Correspondingly, a computational framework capable of accurately distinguishing tumour from non-tumour cells has yet to be developed and cell annotation algorithms are unable to assign integrated genomic and transcriptional profiles to single cells on a cell-by-cell basis. To address these barriers, we developed the Single Cell Rule Association Mining (SCRAM) tool that integrates RNA-inferred genomic alterations with co-occurring cell type signatures for individual cells. Applying SCRAM to glioma, we identified tumour cell trajectories recapitulate temporally-restricted developmental paradigms and feature unique co-occurring identities. Specifically, we validated two previously unreported tumour cell populations with immune and neuronal signatures as hallmarks of human glioma subtypes. In vivo modeling revealed a rare immune-like tumour cell population resembling antigen presenting cells can direct CD8+ T cell responses. In parallel, Patch sequencing studies in human tumours confirmed that neuronal-like glioma cells fire action potentials and represent 40% of IDH1 mutant tumor cells. These studies identified new glioma cell types with functional properties similar to their non-tumour analogues and demonstrate the ability of SCRAM to identify these cell types in unprecedented detail.",

The number of amino acids, molecular weight, isoelectric point, amino acid composition, charged residues, mass-charge ratio, hydropathicity of the proteins were taken into consideration in the analyses, and the relative peak and dip of the average with spike protein sequences based on hydrophobic mass to isoelectric charges of amino acids were also examined. The analyses with the algorithm provide more clear insights leading to revealing underline evolving trends of the viral proteins. Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants, seasonal and murine coronaviruses were taken as representative examples in this study.

    "abstract": "Gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting or introgression has been described in numerous genomic datasets. Among distantly related taxa, however, it is difficult to differentiate these biological sources of discordance from discordance due to errors in gene tree reconstruction, even when supervised machine learning techniques are used to infer individual gene trees. Here, rather than applying machine learning to the problem of inferring single tree topologies, we develop a model to infer important properties of a particular internal branch of the species tree via genome-scale summary statistics extracted from individual alignments and inferred gene trees. We show that our model can effectively predict the presence/absence of discordance, estimate the probability of discordance, and infer the correct species tree topology in the presence of multiple, common sources of error. While gene tree topology counts are the most salient predictors of discordance at short time scales, other genomic features become relevant for distantly related species. We validate our approach through simulation, and apply it to data from the deepest splits among metazoans. Our results suggest that the base of Metazoa experienced significant gene tree discordance, implying that discordant traits among current taxa can be explained without invoking homoplasy. In addition, we find support for Porifera as the sister clade to the rest of Metazoa. Overall, these results demonstrate how machine learning can be used to answer important phylogenetic questions, while marginalizing over individual gene tree--and even species tree--topologies.",

They play a central role in generating an effective immune response against infectious pathogens, and failures in their regulating mechanisms can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer. While previous works study experimental systems of the immune response with mouse models that are immunized with specific antigens, our study focuses on a real life situation, with an ongoing GC response in a human lymph node (LN) involving multiple asynchronized GCs reacting simultaneously to unknown antigens. We combined laser capture microdissection (LCM) of individual GCs from human LN with next-generation repertoire sequencing (Rep-seq) to characterize individual GCs as distinct evolutionary spaces. In line with well-characterized GC responses in mice, elicited by immunization with model antigens such as NP-CGG, we observe a relatively low sequence similarity, as well as heterogeneous clonal diversity across individual GCs from the same human LN. Still, we identify shared clones in several individual GCs, and phylogenetic tree analysis combined with paratope modeling suggest the re-engagement and rediversification of B-cell clones across GCs as well as expanded clones exhibiting shared antigen responses across distinct GCs, indicating convergent evolution of the GCs. Finally, our study allows for the characterization of non-functional clones, where frequencies of V(D)J or SHM induced stop codons are quantified.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channel NaV1.7 has been identified as a potential novel pain target due to its striking human genetics. However, clinically available drugs (e.g. lidocaine, carbamazepine, etc.) are not selective among the nine NaV channel subtypes, NaV1.1-NaV1.9, and the two currently known classes of NaV1.7 subtype-selective inhibitors (aryl- and acylsulfonamides) have undesirable characteristics that may limit their development. Moreover, understanding of the structure-activity relationships of the acylsulfonamide class of NaV1.7 inhibitors, exemplified by the clinical development candidate GDC-0310, has been based solely on a single co-crystal structure of an arylsulfonamide inhibitor series. To advance inhibitor design targeting the NaV1.7 channel, we established an iterative system to routinely obtain high-resolution ligand-bound NaV1.7 structures using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM). We report that GDC-0310 engages the NaV1.7 voltage-sensing domain 4 (VSD4) through an unexpected binding mode orthogonal to the arylsulfonamide class binding pose, which identifies a previously unknown ligand binding site in NaV channels. This finding enabled the design of a novel hybrid inhibitor series that bridges the aryl and acylsulfonamide binding pockets and allows for the generation of molecules with substantially differentiated structures and properties. Overall, this study highlights the power of cryo-EM methods to pursue challenging drug targets using iterative and high-resolution structure-guided inhibitor design. It also underscores an important role of the membrane bilayer in the discovery of selective NaV channel modulators.",

    "abstract": "Accurate translation requires correct mRNAs with intact open reading frames. Cells eliminate defective transcripts to prevent mistranslation by three cytoplasmic mRNA quality control events termed nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), no-go decay (NGD) and non-stop decay (NSD). Translation termination on correct transcripts requires Dbp5 (human DDX19), which delivers eRF1 to the ribosomes and prevents an early contact of eRF1 with eRF3, precluding the immediate dissociation of both release factors and subsequent termination readthrough. Here, we report evidence for an influence of Dbp5 on NMD, as it delivers eRF1 also to PTC-containing transcripts. In contrast to regular translation termination and NMD, functional NGD and NSD require the eRF1-eRF3-like proteins Dom34-Hbs1. We suggest that Dbp5 delivers Dom34 to NGD and NSD substrates as well. However, in contrast to regular termination, it does not prevent an Hbs1 contact, but allows formation of a ternary Dom34-Hbs1-Dbp5 complex. The Dbp5-mediated delivery of Dom34-Hbs1 in NGD and NSD might rather shield and position the complex to prevent a premature contact of Dom34 and Rli1 to prevent inefficient splitting of the ribosomal subunits. Together, we have gathered evidence suggesting an important role of Dbp5 in cytoplasmic mRNA quality control.",

To resolve EV heterogeneity and define the EV populations associated with specific biological processes, we developed a method named \"EV Fingerprinting\" that discerns distinct vesicle populations using dimensional reduction of multi-parametric data collected by quantitative single-EV flow cytometry. After validating this method against synthetic standards, the EV Fingerprinting analysis of highly purified EVs enabled a much more granular resolution of biochemically distinct EV populations than previously established methods. The analysis of EVs produced after molecular perturbation of EV biogenesis through ablation of the GTPase Rab27a and overexpression of the tetraspanin CD63 revealed that EV Fingerprinting reflects the molecular state of a cell. Subsequent analysis of human plasma demonstrates the capacity of EV Fingerprinting to resolve EV populations in complex biological samples and detect tumor-cell derived EVs.",

    "abstract": "As signalling organelles, primary cilia regulate their membrane G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) content by ectocytosis, a process requiring localised actin dynamics at their tip to alter membrane shape.(1, 2) Mammalian photoreceptor outer segments comprise an expanse of folded membranes (discs) at the tip of highly-specialised connecting cilia (CC), in which photosensitive GPCRs like rhodopsin are concentrated. In an extraordinary feat of biology, outer segment discs are shed and remade daily.(3) Defects in this process, due to genetic mutations, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP), an untreatable, blinding disease. The mechanism by which photoreceptor cilia generate outer segments is therefore fundamental for vision yet poorly understood. Here, we show the membrane deformation required for outer segment disc genesis is driven by dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton in a process akin to ectocytosis. Further, we show RPGR, a leading causal RP gene, regulates activity of actin binding proteins crucial to this process. Disc genesis is compromised in Rpgr mouse models, slowing the actin dynamics required for timely disc formation, leading to aborted membrane shedding as ectosome-like vesicles, photoreceptor death and visual loss. Manipulation of actin dynamics partially rescues the phenotype, suggesting this pathway could be targeted therapeutically. These findings help define how actin-mediated dynamics control outer segment turnover.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages provide a first line of defense against invading pathogens, including the leading cause of bacterial mortality, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Phagocytosing extracellular organisms mediate pathogen clearance via a multitude of antimicrobial mechanisms, uniquely designed against an array of pathogens. Macrophages are able to execute different programs of activation in response to pathogenic challenge with host mediators, polarizing them to a variety of differentiation states, including the pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 states. The functional polarization of a macrophage prior to infection, thus impacts the outcome of host-pathogen interaction. One of the limitations when using in vitro differentiated human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) is the heterogeneous nature of the mature population, which presents a challenge for quantitative characterization of various host-pathogen processes. Here, we describe an approach to minimize this heterogeneity, based on micropatterning of cells to reintroduce aspects of cellular homogeneity lost in a 2D tissue culture. Micropatterning consists of growing cells at the single cell level on microfabricated patterns, to constrain the size and shape of the cell, reducing cell-to-cell variation and mimicking the physiological spatial confinement that cells experience in tissues. We infected micropatterned GM-CSF- (M1) and M-CSF- (M2) derived human MDMs with Mtb, which allowed us to study host-pathogen interactions at a single cell level, at high resolution and in a quantitative manner, across tens to hundreds of cells in parallel. Using our approach, we were able to quantify phagocytosis of Mtb in MDMs, finding phagocytic contraction is increased by interferon-gamma stimulation, whilst contraction and bacterial uptake is decreased following silencing of phagocytosis regulator NHLRC2 or Tween80 removal of bacterial surface lipids. We also identify alterations in host organelle position within Mtb infected MDMs, as well as identifying differences in Mtb subcellular localization in relation to the microtubule organizing center (MTOC) and in line with the cellular polarity in M1 and M2 MDMs. Our approach described here can be adapted to study other host-pathogen interactions and co-infections in MDMs and can be coupled with downstream automated analytical approaches.",

In maize, these cells are produced after three rounds of free-nuclear divisions followed by cellularization, differentiation, and proliferation of the antipodal cells. Cellularization of the eight-nucleate syncytium produces seven cells with two polar nuclei in the central cell. Nuclear localization is tightly controlled in the embryo sac as evidenced by the regular, stereotypical position of the nuclei in all syncytial stages of female gametophyte development. This leads to precise allocation of the nuclei into the cells upon cellularization. Nuclear positioning within the syncytium is highly correlated with their identity after cellularization. Two mutants are described with extra polar nuclei, abnormal antipodal cell morphology, and reduced antipodal cell number, which is correlated with a frequent loss of auxin signaling in the antipodal cell cluster. Mutations in one of these genes, indeterminate gametophyte2 encoding a MICROTUBULE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN65-3 homolog, shows a requirement for MAP65-3 in cellularization of the syncytial embryo sac and that the identity of the nuclei in the syncytial female gametophyte can be changed very late before cellularization.",

Nonetheless, our knowledge about an involvement of short-distance CK translocation in root mineral nutrition is still scarce and specific role of CK transporters in root morphology has yet to be established.

In this work, we identified and characterized the Medicago truncatula full-size ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter belonging to the G subfamily, namely MtABCG40 as a CK importer. Its expression is root-specific and is induced by nitrogen deprivation and CKs. Our analyses indicate that MtABCG40 has a negative impact on lateral root density through decreased lateral root initiation and enhancement of primary root elongation. Moreover, in line with postulated resemblance to lateral roots, we also observed an inhibitory influence of this transporter on nodule number. Our results suggest that MtABCG40 action affects CK signaling which impacts on the cellular response to auxin. We present data that demonstrate a full-size ABCG transporter with a novel function in legumes and CK transport.",

    "abstract": "Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina (Pt) is among the most devastating diseases posing a significant threat to global wheat production. The continuously evolving virulent Pt races in North America calls for exploring new sources of leaf rust resistance. A diversity panel of 365 bread wheat accessions selected from a worldwide population of landraces and cultivars was evaluated at the seedling stage against four Pt races (TDBJQ, TBBGS, MNPSD and, TNBJS). A wide distribution of seedling responses against the four Pt races was observed. Majority of the genotypes displayed a susceptible response with only 28 (9.8%), 59 (13.5%), 45 (12.5%), and 29 (8.1%) wheat accessions exhibiting a highly resistant response to TDBJQ, TBBGS, MNPSD and, TNBJS, respectively. Further, we conducted a high-resolution multi-locus genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a set of 302,524 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The GWAS analysis identified 27 marker-trait associations (MTAs) for leaf rust resistance on different wheat chromosomes of which 20 MTAs were found in the vicinity of known Lr genes, MTAs, or quantitative traits loci (QTLs) identified in previous studies. The remaining seven significant MTAs identified represent genomic regions that harbor potentially novel genes for leaf rust resistance. Furthermore, the candidate gene analysis for the significant MTAs identified various genes of interest that may be involved in disease resistance. The identified resistant lines and SNPs linked to the QTLs in this study will serve as valuable resources in wheat rust resistance breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "Spike architecture largely affects grain number embraced, which is an important trait to optimize during wheat breeding process. In this study, we incorporated multi-omic data and investigated the genetic regulation of wheat spike development. We generated transcriptome and epigenome profiles of shoot apex at eight developmental stages and observed that chromatin accessibility and H3K27me3 abundance coordinated with transcriptome alteration for flowering transition. A core transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) that drove the formation of the wheat spike was constructed. Integration of the TRN and genome-wide association analysis (GWAS) led to the identification of 227 transcription factors (TFs) with both known (42) and unknown (185) functions. Multi-layer regulatory module among TaSPL6, TaMADS34 and TaMADS15 identified by TRN was validated experimentally. Of the 85 novel TFs with homozygous mutant lines in TILLING library, 38 showed altered spike architecture or flowering time, including bHLH, MYB, and WRKY. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TaMYB4-A regulates fertile spikelet number likely via regulating hormones homeostasis and signaling, and is downstream of, and repressed by WFZP. The elite allele of TaMYB4-A, with a C-SNP at the WFZP binding site, was selected for balancing spikelet number and fertility during breeding process in China. Collectively, our findings provide high-confidence novel regulators and an efficient strategy for studying the genetic basis of wheat spike development for practical breeding applications.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) in legume root nodules requires a steady supply of molybdenum (Mo) for synthesis of the iron-Mo cofactor for nitrogenase in bacteroids. For this nutrient to be exported by the host plant it must cross the peribacteroid membrane (PBM), however, the molybdate transporter responsible has not yet been identified. A Lotus japonicus symbiotic mutant, sen1, forms nodules that do not fix nitrogen; it has nodule defects and bacteroid degradation. The biochemical function and subcellular localization of SEN1 protein remains to be elucidated. Here, we found a new phenotype in which the SEN1 mutation resulted in increased Mo accumulation in the nodule host fractions but decreased Mo accumulation in the bacteroids at 10 days post inoculation. We identified the molybdate efflux transport activity of SEN1 via heterologous expression in yeast. SEN1 was expressed exclusively in nodules, and its expression was stable in response to varying Mo supply in nutrient solution. In situ immunostaining verified that the SEN1 protein is localized, in part, to the PBM in the rhizobium-infected cells. Taken together, these results confirmed that SEN1 is responsible for mediating molybdate efflux from the cytosol of nodule host cells to the symbiosomes for SNF. Furthermore, SEN1 mutation reduced the expression of nifD and nifK, suggesting that SEN1 may be pertinent to iron-Mo-cofactor assembly. This work fills the knowledge gap regarding how molybdate is allocated from the host plant to the bacteroids; such knowledge is critical for developing new SNF biological systems in non-legume plants.\n\nOne-sentence summarySEN1 is localized partly in the peribacteroid membrane of nodule cells and mediates the molybdate exportation from the host plant cytosol to the symbiosomes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation.",

    "abstract": "Protein unfolding is a dynamic cooperative process with many short-lived intermediates. Cooperativity means that similar molecular elements act dependently on each other. The thermodynamics of protein unfolding can be determined with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The measurement of the heat capacity provides the temperature profiles of enthalpy, entropy and free energy. The thermodynamics of protein unfolding is completely determined with these thermodynamic properties. We emphasise the model-independent analysis of the heat capacity. The temperature profiles of enthalpy H(T), entropy S(T) and free energy G(T) can be obtained directly by a numerical integration of Cp(T). In evaluating different models for protein unfolding. It is essential to simulate all thermodynamic properties, not only the heat capacity. A chemical equilibrium two-state model is a widely used approximation to protein unfolding. The model assumes a chemical equilibrium between only two protein conformations, the native protein (N) and the unfolded protein (U). The model fits the heat capacity Cp(T) quite well, but fails in simulating the other thermodynamic properties. In this review we propose a modification of the chemical equilibrium two-state model, which removes these inconsistencies. We also propose a new statistical-mechanical two-state model based on a simple, two-parameter partition function Z(T), from which all thermodynamic parameters can be derived. The thermodynamic predictions of the new models are compared to published DSC-experiments obtained with lysozyme, a globular protein, and {beta}-lactoglobulin, a {beta}-barrel protein. Good fits to all thermodynamic properties are obtained. In particular, the models predict a zero free energy for the native protein, which is confirmed experimentally by DSC. This is in contrast to the often-cited chemical equilibrium two-state model, which predict a positive free energy for the native protein. Two-state models use macroscopic fit parameters, the conformational enthalpy and the heat capacity difference between native and unfolded protein. These simulations provide no molecular insight. The review therefore includes a recently published multistate cooperative model based on physicality well-defined molecular parameters only.",

    "abstract": "Many secreted proteins contain multiple disulfide bonds. How disulfide formation is coupled to protein folding in the cell remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we combine experiment and simulation to address this question as it pertains to the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). We show that, whereas RBD can refold reversibly when its disulfides are intact, their disruption causes misfolding into a nonnative molten-globule state that is highly prone to aggregation and disulfide scrambling. Thus, non-equilibrium mechanisms are needed to ensure disulfides form prior to folding in vivo. Our simulations suggest that co-translational folding may accomplish this, as native disulfide pairs are predicted to form with high probability at intermediate lengths, ultimately committing the RBD to its metastable native state and circumventing nonnative intermediates. This detailed molecular picture of the RBD folding landscape may shed light on SARS-CoV-2 pathology and molecular constraints governing SARS-CoV-2 evolution.",

    "abstract": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had great societal and health consequences. Despite the availability of vaccines, infection rates remain high due to immune evasive Omicron sublineages. Broad-spectrum antivirals are needed to safeguard against emerging variants and future pandemics. We used mRNA display under a reprogrammed genetic code to find a spike-targeting macrocyclic peptide that inhibits SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan strain infection and pseudoviruses containing spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants or related sarbecoviruses. Structural and bioinformatic analyses reveal a conserved binding pocket between the receptor binding domain, N-terminal domain and S2 region, distal to the ACE2 receptor-interaction site. Our data reveal a hitherto unexplored site of vulnerability in sarbecoviruses that peptides and potentially other drug-like molecules can target.\n\nSignificance statementThis study reports on the discovery of a macrocyclic peptide that is able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by exploiting a new vulnerable site in the spike glycoprotein. This region is highly conserved across SARS-CoV-2 variants and the subgenus sarbecovirus. Due to the inaccessability and mutational contraint of this site, it is anticipated to be resistant to the development of resistance through antibody selective pressure. In addition to the discovery of a new molecule for development of potential new peptide or biomolecule therapeutics, the discovery of this broadly active conserved site can also stimulate a new direction of drug development, which together may prevent future outbreaks of related viruses.",

    "abstract": "Non-genetic factors can cause significant fluctuations in gene expression levels. Regardless of growing in a stable environment, this fluctuation leads to cell-to-cell variability in an isogenic population. This phenotypic heterogeneity allows a tiny subset of bacterial cells in a population, referred to as persister cells, to tolerate long-term lethal antibiotic effects by entering into a non-dividing, metabolically altered state. One fundamental question is whether this heterogeneous persister population is due to a pre-existing genetic mutation or a result of a transiently-primed reversible cell state. To explore this, we tested clonal populations starting from a single cell using a modified Luria-Delbruck fluctuation test. Through we kept the conditions the same, the diversity in persistence level among clones was relatively consistent: varying from [~]60-100 and [~]40-70 fold for ampicillin (Amp) and apramycin (Apr), respectively. Then we divided and diluted each clone to observe whether the same clone had comparable persister levels for more than one generation. Replicates had similar persister levels even when clones were divided, diluted by 1:20, and allowed to grow for [~]5 generations. This result explicitly shows a cellular memory passed on for generations and eventually lost when cells are diluted to 1:100 and regrown (>7 generations). Our result demonstrates 1) the existence of a small population prepared for stress (\"primed cells\") resulting in higher persister numbers, 2) the primed memory state is reproducible and transient, passed down for generations but eventually lost, and 3) a heterogeneous persister population is a result of a transiently-primed reversible cell state and not due to a pre-existing genetic mutation.",

    "abstract": "People living with HIV (PLWH) on suppressive antiretroviral therapy (ART) can have residual immune dysfunction and often display poorer responses to vaccination. We assessed in a cohort of PLWH (n=110) and HIV negative controls (n=64) the humoral and spike-specific B-cell responses following 1, 2 or 3 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine doses. PLWH had significantly lower neutralizing antibody (nAb) titers than HIV-negative controls at all studied timepoints. Moreover, their neutralization breadth was reduced with fewer individuals developing a neutralizing response against the Omicron variant (BA.1) relative to controls. We also observed a delayed development of neutralization in PLWH that was underpinned by a reduced frequency of spike-specific memory B cells (MBCs) and pronounced B cell dysfunction. Improved neutralization breadth was seen after the third vaccine dose in PLWH but lower nAb responses persisted and were associated with global, but not spike-specific, MBC dysfunction. In contrast to the inferior antibody responses, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induced robust T cell responses that cross-recognized variants in PLWH. Strikingly, a subset of PLWH with low or absent neutralization had detectable functional T cell responses. These individuals had reduced numbers of circulating T follicular helper cells and an enriched population of CXCR3+CD127+CD8+ T cells after two doses of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, which may compensate for sub-optimal serological responses in the event of infection. Therefore, normalisation of B cell homeostasis could improve serological responses to vaccines in PLWH and evaluating T cell immunity could provide a more comprehensive immune status profile in these individuals and others with B cell imbalances.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile infections begin when its metabolically dormant spores germinate in response to sensing bile acid germinants alongside amino acid and divalent cation co-germinants in the small intestine. While bile acid germinants are essential for C. difficile spore germination, it is currently unclear whether both co-germinant signals are required. One model proposes that divalent cations, particularly Ca2+, are essential for inducing germination, while another proposes that either co-germinant class can induce germination. The former model is based on the finding that spores defective in releasing large stores of internal Ca2+ in the form of calcium dipicolinic acid (CaDPA) cannot germinate when germination is induced with bile acid germinant and amino acid co-germinant alone. However, since the reduced optical density of CaDPA-less spores makes it difficult to accurately measure their germination, we developed a novel automated, time-lapse microscopy-based germination assay to analyze CaDPA mutant germination at the single-spore level. Using this assay, we found that CaDPA mutant spores germinate in the presence of amino acid co-germinant and bile acid germinant. Higher levels of amino acid co-germinants are nevertheless required to induce CaDPA mutant spores to germinate relative to WT spores because CaDPA released by WT spores during germination can function in a feedforward loop to potentiate the germination of other spores within the population. Collectively, these data indicate that Ca2+ is not essential for inducing C. difficile spore germination because amino acid and Ca2+ co-germinant signals are sensed by parallel signaling pathways.\n\nImportanceClostridioides difficile spore germination is essential for this major nosocomial pathogen to initiate infection. C. difficile spores germinate in response to sensing bile acid germinant signals alongside co-germinant signals. There are two classes of co-germinant signals: Ca2+ and amino acids. Prior work suggested that Ca2+ is essential for C. difficile spore germination based on bulk population analyses of germinating CaDPA mutant spores. Since these assays rely on optical density to measure spore germination and the optical density of CaDPA mutant spores is reduced relative to WT spores, this bulk assay is limited in its capacity to analyze germination. To overcome this limitation, we developed an automated image analysis pipeline to monitor C. difficile spore germination using time-lapse microscopy. With this analysis pipeline, we demonstrate that, although Ca2+ is dispensable for inducing C. difficile spore germination, CaDPA can function in a feedforward loop to potentiate the germination of neighboring spores.",

    "abstract": "Nutrient availability can significantly influence microbial genomic and proteomic streamlining, for example by selecting for lower nitrogen to carbon ratios. Oligotrophic open ocean microbes have streamlined genomic nitrogen requirements relative to their counterparts in nutrient-rich coastal waters. However, steep gradients in nutrient availability occur at meter- and even micron-level spatial scales. It is unclear if such gradients also structure genomic and proteomic stoichiometry. Focusing on the eastern tropical North Pacific oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), we use comparative metagenomics to examine how nitrogen availability shapes microbial and viral genome properties along the vertical gradient across the OMZ and between two size fractions distinguishing free-living versus particle-associated microbes. We find a substantial increase in nitrogen content of encoded proteins in particle-associated over free-living bacteria and archaea across nitrogen availability regimes over depth. Within each size-fraction, we find that bacterial and viral genomic nitrogen tends to increase with increasing nitrate concentrations with depth. In contrast to cellular genes, the nitrogen content of virus proteins does not differ between size fractions. We identified arginine as a key amino acid in modulating the C:N ratio of core genes for bacteria, archaea, and viruses. Functional analysis reveals that particle-associated bacterial metagenomes are enriched for genes involved in arginine metabolism and organic nitrogen compound catabolism. Our results are consistent with nitrogen streamlining in both cellular and viral genomes on spatial scales of meters to microns. These effects are similar in magnitude to those previously reported across scales of thousands of kilometers.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe genomes of marine microbes can be shaped by nutrient cycles, with ocean-scale gradients in nitrogen availability known to influence microbial amino acid usage. It is unclear, however, how genomic properties are shaped by nutrient changes over much smaller spatial scales, for example along the vertical transition into oxygen minimum zones (OMZs) or from the exterior to interior of detrital particles. Here, we measure protein nitrogen usage by marine bacteria, archaea, and viruses using metagenomes from the nitracline of the eastern tropical North Pacific OMZ including both particle-associated and non-associated biomass. Our results show higher genomic and proteomic nitrogen content in particle-associated microbes and at depths with higher nitrogen availability for cellular and viral genomes. This discovery suggests that stoichiometry influences microbial and viral evolution across multiple scales, including the micro- to millimeter scale associated with particle-associated versus free-living lifestyles.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a frequent cause of life-threatening opportunistic infections in the critically ill and immunocompromised. Its treatment is challenging due to the increasing prevalence of resistance to most conventional antibiotics. Although numerous alternative therapies are currently under investigation, bacteriophage (phage) cocktail therapy appears poised for long-term success. Here, we investigate potency and longevity of individual Pseudomonas phages in cocktail to determine viral co-factors that promote optimal treatment efficacy. We combined in vitro and in silico models to predict sixty-eight treatment permutations with three phages that adsorb symmetrically and asymmetrically when administered singly, double simultaneously, or double sequentially. We showed that simultaneously administering two asymmetrically binding phages with high cell lysis efficiencies improved cocktail potency. Use of a higher-potency cocktail, along with a reduction in the net probability of independent gene mutations was associated with prolonged bacterial suppression. Nevertheless, in vitro we almost always observed evolution of multiphage resistance. Simulations also predict that when combining phages with polar potencies, susceptible host cells are monopolized by the more efficiently replicating phage. Thus, further perpetuating the growth demise of the weaker phage in cocktail. Our mathematical model was used to explore and predict changes in phage and bacterial populations that were difficult to measure experimentally. This framework has many inferential and exploratory uses for clinical investigation such as identifying the most sensitive parameters for phage selection and exploring different treatment regimens. Collectively, our findings attempt to dissect the mechanisms of phage cocktails combating P. aeruginosa infections and highlight the viral co-factors necessary for treatment efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Structural metastability of viral capsids is pivotal for viruses to survive in harsh environments and to undergo timely conformational changes required for cell entry. Mammalian orthoreovirus (reovirus) is a model to study capsid metastability. Following initial disassembly of the reovirus particle mediated by proteases, a metastable intermediate called the infectious subvirion particle (ISVP) is generated. Using a {sigma}1 monoreassortant virus, we recently showed that {sigma}1 properties affect its encapsidation on particles and the metastability of ISVPs. How metastability is impacted by {sigma}1 and whether the lower encapsidation level of {sigma}1 is connected to this property is unknown. To define a correlation between encapsidation of {sigma}1 and ISVP stability, we generated mutant viruses with single amino acid polymorphisms in {sigma}1 or those that contain chimeric {sigma}1 molecules composed of {sigma}1 portions from Type 1 and Type 3 reovirus strains. We found that under most conditions where {sigma}1 encapsidation on the particle was lower, ISVPs displayed lower stability. By separating wild-type particles based on the level of encapsidated {sigma}1, we also found that lower {sigma}1 encapsidation leads to lower ISVP stability. Characterization of mutant viruses selected for enhanced stability via a forward genetic approach also revealed that in some cases, {sigma}1 properties influence stability without influencing {sigma}1 encapsidation. These data indicate that {sigma}1 can also influence ISVP stability independent of its level of incorporation. Together, our work reveals an underappreciated effect of the {sigma}1 attachment protein on the properties of the reovirus capsid.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) engineered to express heterologous viral glycoproteins have proven to be remarkably effective vaccines. Indeed, rVSV-EBOV, which expresses the Ebola virus (EBOV) glycoprotein, recently received clinical approval in the United States and Europe for its ability to prevent EBOV disease. Analogous rVSV vaccines expressing the glycoproteins of different human-pathogenic filoviruses have also been developed and shown to be effective in pre-clinical evaluations, yet these vaccine candidates have not progressed far beyond research laboratories. As the current outbreak of Sudan virus (SUDV) intensifies in Uganda, the need for proven countermeasures is rendered even more acute. Here we demonstrate that an rVSV-based vaccine expressing the SUDV glycoprotein (rVSV-SUDV) generates a potent humoral immune response that completely protects guinea pigs from SUDV disease and death. Although the cross-protection generated by rVSV vaccines for different filoviruses is thought to be limited, we wondered whether rVSV-EBOV might also provide protection against SUDV, which is closely related to EBOV. Surprisingly, nearly 60% of guinea pigs that were vaccinated with rVSV-EBOV and challenged with SUDV survived, suggesting that rVSV-EBOV offers limited protection against SUDV, at least in the guinea pig model. These results were confirmed by a back-challenge experiment in which animals that had been vaccinated with rVSV-EBOV and survived EBOV challenge were inoculated with SUDV and survived. Whether these data are applicable to the efficacy of rVSV-EBOV in humans is unknown, and they should therefore be interpreted cautiously. Nevertheless, this study confirms the potency of the rVSV-SUDV vaccine, and it highlights the potential for rVSV-EBOV to elicit a cross-protective immune response.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial gut commensals experience a biologically and physically complex mucosal environment. While many chemical factors mediate the composition and structure of these microbial communities, less is known about the role of mechanics. Here, we demonstrate that fluid flow impacts the spatial organization and composition of gut biofilm communities by shaping how different species interact metabolically. We first demonstrate that a model community composed of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt) and Bacteroides fragilis (Bf), two representative human commensals, can form robust biofilms in flow. We identified dextran as a polysaccharide readily metabolized by Bt but not Bf, but whose fermentation generates a public good enabling Bf growth. We demonstrate that in flow, Bt biofilms share dextran metabolic by-products, promoting Bf biofilm formation. By transporting this public good, flow structures the spatial organization of the community, positioning the Bf population downstream from Bt. We show that sufficiently strong flows abolish Bf biofilm formation by limiting the effective public good concentration at the surface. Physical factors such as flow may therefore contribute to the composition of intestinal microbial communities, potentially impacting host health.",

    "abstract": "The American lobster, Homarus americanus, is an economically valuable and ecologically important crustacean along the North Atlantic coast of North America. Populations in southern locations have declined in recent decades due to increasing ocean temperatures and disease, and these circumstances are progressing northward. We monitored 57 adult female lobsters, healthy and shell-diseased, under three seasonal temperature cycles for a year, to track shell bacterial communities using culturing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, progression of ESD using visual assessment, and antimicrobial activity of hemolymph. The richness of bacterial taxa present, evenness of abundance, and community similarity between lobsters was affected by water temperature at the time of sampling, water temperature over time based on seasonal temperature regimes, shell disease severity, and molt stage. Several bacteria were prevalent on healthy lobster shells but missing or less abundant on diseased shells, although putative pathogens were found on all shells regardless of health status.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/512360v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (61K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c17e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@103e122org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b1b718org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b95d5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Molecular interactions of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) with GTPase Activating Protein SH3 Domain Binding Protein 1 (G3BP1) host protein is important for efficient replication of CHIKV. CHIKV nsP3 protein binds to the nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2) -like domain of G3BP1 via two tandem FGDF motifs and disrupts the stress granules (SGs) formation. Interestingly, this makes the G3BP1 host protein an additional drug target for antiviral research. In this study, seven potential small molecules-targeting FGDF motif binding pocket of G3BP1 have been identified using structure-based virtual screening approach. Binding energies and binding modes of the molecules were further analyzed in detail through molecular docking, dynamics and simulations. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) experiments confirmed the binding of identified molecules to purified G3BP1 with binding affinities in micromolar (M) range. The antiviral efficacy of molecules targeting G3BP1 was evaluated by in vitro cell culture-based antiviral studies. All seven molecules L-7, WIN, SB2, NAL, DHD, GSK and FLU effectively diminished the CHIKV replication with EC50 values of 1.996, 0.403, 5.387, 1.528, 7.394, 3.664, and 0.618 {micro}M, respectively. Moreover, the CHIKV infected cells treated with these molecules seemed to have fewer virus-induced SGs than virus infected control cells. Interestingly, the inhibitors showed no adverse effect on SG formation in oxidative stress condition. It further substantiated that these inhibitors effectively bind to the NTF2-like domain of G3BP1, obstruct the nsP3-G3BP1 interactions, and halts virus replication. This is the first report of small molecules targeting G3BP1, the host protein playing a crucial role in CHIKV viral replication and in the formation of SGs for host antiviral response.",

    "abstract": "Roughly half of animal mRNAs contain upstream Open Reading Frames (uORFs). These uORFs represent an impediment to translation of the main ORF since ribosomes usually bind the mRNA cap at the 5 end and then scan for ORFs in a 5-to-3 fashion. One way for ribosomes to bypass uORFs is via leaky scanning, whereby the ribosome disregards the uORF start codon. Hence leaky scanning is an important instance of post-transcriptional regulation that affects gene expression. Few molecular factors regulating or facilitating this process are known. Here we show that the PRRC2 proteins PRRC2A, PRRC2B and PRRC2C regulate translation initiation. We find that they bind eukaryotic translation initiation factors and preinitiation complexes, and are enriched on ribosomes translating mRNAs with uORFs. We find that PRRC2 proteins promote leaky scanning past translation start codons, thereby promoting translation of mRNAs containing uORFs. Since PRRC2 proteins have been associated with cancer, this provides a mechanistic starting point for understanding their physiological and pathophysiological roles.",

    "abstract": "MiRNAs are critical regulators of numerous physiological and pathological processes. Ascosphaera apis exclusively infects bee larvae and causes chalkbrood disease. However, the function and mechanism of miRNAs in the bee larval response to A. apis infection is poorly understood. Here, ame-miR-34, a previously predicted miRNA involved in the response of Apis mellifera ligustica larvae to A. apis invasion, was subjected to molecular validation, and overexpression and knockdown were then conducted to explore the regulatory functions of ame-miR-34 in larval body weight and immune response. Stem-loop RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing confirmed the authenticity of ame-miR-34 in the larval gut of A. m. ligustica. RT-qPCR results demonstrated that compared with that in the uninfected larval guts, the expression level of ame-miR-34 was significantly downregulated (P < 0.001) in the guts of A. apis-infected 4-, 5-, and 6-day-old larvae, indicative of the remarkable suppression of host ame-miR-34 due to A. apis infection. In comparison with the corresponding negative control (NC) groups, the expression level of ame-miR-34 in the larval guts in the mimic-miR-34 group was significantly upregulated (P < 0.001), while that in the inhibi- tor-miR-34 group was significantly downregulated (P < 0.01). Similarly, effective overexpression and knockdown of ame-miR-34 were achieved. In addition, the body weights of 5- and 6-day-old larvae were significantly increased compared with those in the mimic-NC group; the weights of 5-day-old larvae in the inhibitor-miR-34 group were significantly decreased in comparison with those in the inhibitor-NC group, while the weights of 4- and 6-day-old larvae in the inhibi- tor-miR-34 group were significantly increased, indicating the involvement of ame-miR-34 in modulating larval body weight. Furthermore, the expression levels of both hsp and abct in the guts of A. apis-infected 4-, 5- and 6-day-old larvae were significantly upregulated after ame-miR-34 overexpression. In contrast, after ame-miR-34 knockdown, the expression levels of the aforementioned two key genes in the A. apis-infected 4-, 5- and 6-day-old larval guts were significantly downregu- lated. Together, the results demonstrated that effective overexpression and knockdown of ame-miR-34 in both noninfected and A. apis-infected A. m. ligustica larval guts could be achieved by the feeding method, and ame-miR-34 exerted a regulatory function in the host immune response to A. apis invasion through positive regulation of the expression of hsp and abct. Our findings not only provide a valuable reference for the functional investigation of bee larval miRNAs but also reveal the regulatory role of ame-miR-34 in A. mellifera larval weight and immune response. Additionally, the results of this study may provide a promising molecular target for the treatment of chalkbrood disease.",

    "abstract": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a pathological widening of the aortic wall characterized by loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), extracellular matrix degradation, and local inflammation. This condition is often asymptomatic until rupture occurs, leading to high morbidity and mortality rates. Diagnosis is often accidental, and for now, the only available treatment option remains surgical intervention. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are RNA loops that originated from backsplicing, which have received increasing attention as a novel class of functional non-coding RNAs contributing to cardiovascular physiology and disease. Their high structural stability, combined with a remarkable enrichment in body fluids, make circRNAs promising disease biomarkers. We aimed to investigate the contribution of circRNAs to AAA pathogenesis and their potential application as biomarkers for AAA diagnosis. Combined circRNA array and quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed the presence of differentially expressed circular transcripts stemming from AAA-relevant gene loci. Among these, the circRNA to the Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (cATM) was upregulated in human AAA tissue specimens, in AAA patient-derived SMCs, and serum samples collected from aneurysm patients. In control primary aortic SMCs, cATM increased upon angiotensin II stimulation, while its silencing triggered apoptosis. Furthermore, doxorubicin could induce cATM expression, supporting a link with acute stress response in SMCs. Constitutively higher cATM expressing AAA patient-derived SMCs were less vulnerable to oxidative stress-induced cell death and survival pathways enriched when compared to control SMCs. Taken together, this data supports the role of cATM in adapting SMCs to oxidative stress in the vascular AAA micromilieu. This molecular signature provides an additional parameter to be included in procedures for AAA screening in combination with already established practices.",

We found that Silc1 is rapidly and strongly induced upon stimulation in the hippocampus and is required for efficient spatial learning. Silc1 production is important for the induction of Sox11 (its cis-regulated target gene) throughout the CA1-CA3 regions and the proper expression of key Sox11 target genes. Consistent with its newly found role in neuronal plasticity, we find that during aging and in models of Alzheimers disease Silc1 levels decline. Overall, we uncover a novel plasticity pathway, in which Silc1 acts as an immediate-early gene to activate Sox11 to induce a neuronal growth-associated transcriptional program important for memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2 still threaten the effectiveness of currently deployed vaccines, and antivirals can prove to be an effective therapeutic option for attenuating it. The papain-like protease (PLpro) is an attractive target due to its sequence conservation and critical role in the replication and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2. PLpro also plays very important role in modulation of host immune responses by deubiquitinating (DUBs) or deISGylating host proteins. Thus, targeting PLpro serves as a two-pronged approach to abate SARS-CoV-2. Due to its structural and functional similarities with the host DUB enzymes, an in-house library of DUB inhibitors was constituted in this study. Five promising compounds exhibiting high binding affinities with the substrate binding site of PLpro were identified from a library of 81 compounds with in silico screening, docking, and simulation studies. Interestingly, lithocholic acid, linagliptin, teneligliptin, and flupenthixol significantly inhibited the proteolytic activity of PLpro. Each of these compounds abrogated in vitro replication of SARS-CoV-2 with EC50 values in the range of 5-21 M. In addition, crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 PLpro and its complex with inhibitors have been determined that revealed their inhibitory mechanism. The findings of this study provide the proof-of-principle that the DUB inhibitors hold high potential as a new class of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, this is the first study that has opened a new avenue towards not only targeting PLpro active site but also simultaneously directing towards restoration of antiviral immune response of the host for deterring SARS-CoV-2.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516107v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (51K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7d0c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab9c13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@93d3f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14021e6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use a diverse arsenal of anti-phage immune systems, including CRISPR-Cas and restriction enzymes. Identifying the full defense repertoire of a given species is still challenging, however. Here, we developed a computational tool to broadly identify anti-phage systems, which was applied to >180,000 genomes available on NCBI, revealing Pseudomonas aeruginosa to possess the most diverse anti-phage arsenal of any species with >200 sequenced genomes. Using network analysis to identify the common neighbors of anti-phage systems, we surprisingly identified two highly conserved core defense hotspot loci (cDHS1 and cDHS2). Across more than 1,000 P. aeruginosa strains, cDHS1 is up to 224 kb (mean: 34 kb) with varied arrangements of at least 31 immune systems while cDHS2 has 24 distinct systems (mean: 15.4 kb). cDHS1/2 are present in most P. aeruginosa isolates, in contrast to highly variable mobile DHSs. Most cDHS genes are of unknown function potentially representing new anti-phage systems, which we validated by identifying a novel anti-phage system (Shango) commonly encoded in cDHS1. Identification of core gene markers that flank immune islands could be a simple approach for immune system discovery and may represent popular landing spots for diverse MGEs carrying anti-phage systems.",

    "abstract": "The physical association of specific regions of chromatin with components of the nuclear lamina provides the framework for the 3-dimensionl architecture of the genome. The regulation of these interactions plays a critical role in the maintenance of gene expression patterns and cell identity. The breakdown and reassembly of the nuclear membrane as cells transit mitosis plays a central role in the regulation of the interactions between the genome and the nuclear lamina. However, other nuclear processes, such as transcription, have emerged as regulators of the association of DNA with the nuclear lamina. To determine whether DNA replication also has the potential to regulate DNA-nuclear lamina interactions, we adapted proximity ligation-based chromatin assembly assays to analyze the dynamics of nuclear lamina association with newly replicated DNA. We observe that lamin A/C and lamin B, as well as inner nuclear membrane proteins LBR and emerin, are found in proximity to newly replicated DNA. While core histones rapidly reassociate with DNA following passage of the replication fork, the complete reassociation of nuclear lamina components with newly replicated DNA occurs over a period of approximately 30 minutes. We propose models to describe the disassembly and reassembly of nascent chromatin with the nuclear lamina.",

    "abstract": "Nanoparticles that undergo a localized morphology change to target areas of inflammation have been previously developed but are limited by their lack of biodegradability. In this paper, we describe a low ring strain cyclic olefin monomer, 1,3-dimethyl-2-phenoxy-1,3,4,7-tetrahydro-1,3,2-diazaphosphepine 2-oxide (MePTDO), that rapidly polymerizes via ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) at room temperature to generate well-defined degradable polyphosphoramidates with high monomer conversion (>84%). Efficient MePTDO copolymerizations with norbornene-based monomers are demonstrated, including a norbornenyl monomer functionalized with a peptide substrate for inflammation-associated matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). The resulting amphiphilic peptide brush copolymers self-assembled in aqueous solution to generate micellar nanoparticles (30 nm in diameter) which exhibit excellent cyto- and hemocompatibility and undergo MMP-induced assembly into micron scale aggregates. As MMPs are upregulated in the heart post-myocardial infarction (MI), the MMP-responsive micelles were applied to target and accumulate in the infarcted heart following intravenous administration in a rat model of MI. These particles displayed a distinct biodistribution and clearance pattern in comparison to non-degradable analogues. Specifically, accumulation at the site of MI, competed with elimination predominantly through the kidney rather than the liver. Together, these results suggest this as a promising new biodegradable platform for inflammation targeted delivery.",

    "abstract": "14-3-3 proteins are central hub regulators of hundreds of phosphorylated \"client\" proteins. They are subject to over 60 post-translational modifications (PTMs), yet little is known how these PTMs alter 14-3-3 function and its ability to regulate downstream signaling pathways. An often neglected, but well documented 14-3-3 PTM found under physiological and immune-stimulatory conditions is the conversion of tyrosine to 3-nitro-tyrosine at several Tyr sites, two of which are located at sites considered important for 14-3-3 function: Y130 ({beta}-isoform numbering) is located in the primary phospho-client peptide binding groove, while Y213 is found on a secondary binding site that engages with clients for full 14-3-3/client complex formation and client regulation. By genetically encoding 3-nitro-tyrosine, we sought to understand if nitration at Y130 and Y213 effectively modulated 14-3-3 structure, function, and client complexation. The 1.5 [A] resolution crystal structure of 14-3-3 nitrated at Y130 showed the nitro group altered the conformation of key residues in the primary binding site, while functional studies confirmed client proteins failed to bind this variant of 14-3-3. But, in contrast to other client-binding deficient variants, it did not localize to the nucleus. The 1.9 [A] resolution structure of 14-3-3 nitrated at Y213 revealed unusual flexibility of its C-terminal -helix resulting in domain swapping, suggesting additional structural plasticity though its relevance is not clear as this nitrated form retained its ability to bind clients. Collectively, our data suggest nitration of 14-3-3 will alter downstream signaling systems, and if uncontrolled could result in global dysregulation of the 14-3-3 interactome.",

    "abstract": "The proteolytic conversion of soluble procollagens into mature collagen monomers is a critical step to decrease their solubility and trigger collagen fibril formation. In the case of collagens I, II and III, this maturation process is driven by several extracellular metalloproteinases such as BMP-1, tolloid-like proteinases, meprin , meprin {beta}, ADAMTS-2 and ADAMTS-14 but the extensive characterization of these proteolytic events has been hampered by the lack of recombinant procollagens. We previously reported the production and partial characterization of recombinant homotrimeric proteins derived from procollagen III (mini-procollagens III) and, in this study, we describe how we have extended this previous work to the production of heterotrimeric mini-procollagen I and homotrimeric mini-procollagen II. These mini-procollagens include truncated triple helices and intact C-telopeptide and C-propeptide domains and were produced in suspension in HEK293-F cells with yields ranging from 2.5 mg/L to 10 mg/L after purification. They proved very useful tools to analyze the effect of calcium on the stability of the procollagen C-terminal region and to compare the procollagen C-proteinase activity of BMP-1 on the three major fibrillar procollagens or their ability to interact with various partners such as PCPE-1. Using mass spectrometry to map BMP-1 cleavage sites on the mini-procollagens, we confirmed all previously described sites but also revealed two additional cleavage sites in the 1 chain of procollagens I and II. This result shows that the mini-procollagen toolkit offers a broad range of perspectives to make functional studies but also possibly structural analyses or to develop drug screening assays.",

    "abstract": "Quinone reductases 1 and 2 (NQO1 and NQO2) are paralogous FAD-linked enzymes found in all amniotes. NQO1 and NQO2 have similar structures and can both catalyze reduction of quinones and other electrophiles. The two enzymes differ in their cosubstrate specificity, with NQO1 using cellular redox couples NAD(H) and NADP(H), while NQO2 is almost completely inactive with these cosubstrates, and instead uses dihydronicotinamide riboside (NRH) and small synthetic cosubstrates such as N-benzyl-dihydronicotinamide (BNAH). We used ancestral sequence reconstruction to investigate the catalytic properties of a predicted common ancestor and 2 additional ancestors from each of the evolutionary pathways to extant NQO1 and NQO2. In all cases, the small nicotinamide cosubstrates NRH and BNAH were good cosubstrates for the common ancestor and the enzymes along the NQO1 and NQO2 lineages. In the case of NADH, however, extant NQO1 evolved to a catalytic efficiency 100x higher than the common ancestor, while NQO2 has evolved to a catalytic efficiency 1000x lower than the common ancestor. In addition, 13 chimeric enzymes were created to investigate the molecular basis of cosubstrate specificity, which was further elaborated by site-directed mutagenesis of the ancestral NQO2. Overall, the results suggest a selective pressure for evolution of NQO1 towards greater efficiency with NADH, and for NQO2 towards extremely low efficiency with NADH. These divergent trajectories have implications for the cellular functions of both enzymes, but particularly for NQO2 whose cellular functions are only beginning to be uncovered.",

    "abstract": "Reversible protein phosphorylation is a central signaling mechanism in eukaryotic cells. While the identification of canonical phosphorylation sites using mass-spectrometry (MS) based proteomics has become routine, annotation of non-canonical phosphorylation has remained a challenge. Here, we report a tailored pyrophosphoproteomics workflow to detect and reliably assign protein pyrophosphorylation in two human cell lines, providing the first direct evidence of endogenous protein pyrophosphorylation. Detection of protein pyrophosphorylation was reproducible, specific and consistent with previous biochemical evidence relating the installation of the modification to inositol pyrophosphates (PP-InsPs). We manually validated 148 pyrophosphosites across 71 human proteins, the most heavily pyrophosphorylated of which were the nucleolar proteins NOLC1 and TCOF1. A predictive workflow based on the MS data set was established to recognize putative pyrophosphorylation sequences, and UBF1, a nucleolar protein incompatible with the proteomics method, was biochemically shown to undergo pyrophosphorylation. When the biosynthesis of PP-InsPs was perturbed in a model cell line, proteins expressed in this background exhibited lower levels of pyrophosphorylation. Disruption of PP-InsP biosynthesis also significantly reduced rDNA transcription, potentially by lowering pyrophosphorylation on regulatory proteins NOLC1, TCOF1, and UBF1. Overall, protein pyrophosphorylation emerges as an archetype of non-canonical phosphorylation, and should be considered in future phosphoproteomic analyses.",

    "abstract": "KPC-2 (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2) is a globally disseminated serine-{beta}-lactamase (SBL) responsible for extensive {beta}-lactam antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative pathogens. SBLs inactivate {beta}-lactams via a mechanism involving a hydrolytically labile covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. Carbapenems, the most potent {beta}-lactams, evade activity of many SBLs by forming long-lived inhibitory acyl-enzymes; however, carbapenemases such as KPC-2 efficiently catalyze deacylation of carbapenem-derived acyl-enzymes. We present high-resolution (1.25-1.4 [A]) crystal structures of KPC-2 acyl-enzymes with representative penicillins (ampicillin), cephalosporins (cefalothin) and carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem and ertapenem), obtained utilizing an isosteric deacylation-deficient mutant (E166Q). Mobility of the {Omega}-loop (residues 165-170) negatively correlates with antibiotic turnover rates (kcat), highlighting the role of this region in positioning catalytic residues for efficient hydrolysis of different {beta}-lactams. Carbapenem-derived acyl-enzyme structures reveal predominance of the {Delta}1-(2R) imine tautomer, except for the imipenem acyl-enzyme, which is present in dual occupancy in both {Delta}1-(2R) and (2S) configurations. Quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulations of deacylation of the KPC-2:meropenem acyl-enzyme, using an adaptive string method (ASM), show that the {Delta}1-(2R) isomer has a 7 kcal/mol higher barrier for the (rate-determining) formation of the tetrahedral deacylation intermediate than the {Delta}2 tautomer. The simulations identify tautomer-specific differences in hydrogen bonding networks involving the carbapenem C-3 carboxylate and the deacylating water, that, together with stabilization by protonated N-4 of accumulating negative charge during oxyanion formation, accelerate deacylation of the {Delta}2-enamine acyl-enzyme compared to the {Delta}1-imine. Taken together, our data show how the flexible {Omega}-loop helps confer broad spectrum activity upon KPC-2, while carbapenemase activity stems from efficient deacylation of the {Delta}2-enamine acyl-enzyme tautomer. Differentiation of the barriers associated with deacylation of these subtly different {beta}-lactam isomers further identifies ASM as a sensitive method for calculation of reaction energetics that can accurately model turnover and, potentially, predict the impact of substrate modifications or point mutations upon activity.",

Here we report the use of yeast lumazine synthase as soluble pentameric protein scaffold for the study of receptor ICDs derived from GlyR 1- and {beta}-subunits. We were able to create ICDs assemblies in a homo- (LS-{beta}ICD) and hetero-pentameric state (LS-{beta}ICD) and provide first-in-class structural insights on their high structural flexibility using small angle X-ray scattering. We report a high-affinity interaction between the LS-{beta}ICD and gephyrin leading to the in vitro formation of high-molecular mega-Dalton complexes composed of three gephyrin trimers and three pentamers as basic building block. Depending on the stoichiometric ratios between gephyrin and LS-ICDs the formed complexes grow or shrink in size. In cells, LS-ICDs efficiently recruited gephyrin and were able to accumulate gephyrin at GABAergic synapses in neurons. Our findings collectively propose a new, potentially general, mechanistic concept for a gephyrin-dependent bridging of GlyRs at the inhibitory synapse.",

    "abstract": "Small molecule prodrug approaches that can activate cancer therapeutics selectively in tumors are urgently needed. Here, we developed the first antitumor prodrugs designed for activation by the thioredoxin (Trx) oxidoreductase system. This critical cellular disulfide redox axis is tightly linked to dysregulated redox/metabolic states in cancer, yet it cannot be addressed by current bioreductive prodrugs, which mainly cluster around oxidised nitrogen species. We instead harnessed Trx/TrxR-specific artificial dichalcogenides to gate the bioactivity of a series of 10 \"off-to-on\" reduction-activated duocarmycin prodrugs. The prodrugs were tested for cell-free and cellular activity dependent on reducing enzyme systems in 177 cell lines, to establish broad trends for redox-based cellular bioactivity of the dichalcogenides. They were well tolerated in vivo in mice, indicating low systemic release of their duocarmycin cargo, and in vivo anti-tumor efficacy trials in mouse models of breast and pancreatic cancer gave promising initial results indicating effective tumoral drug release, presumably by in situ bioreductive activation. This work therefore presents a chemically novel class of bioreductive prodrugs against a previously unaddressed reductase type, validates its ability to access in vivo compatible small-molecule prodrugs even of potently cumulative toxins, and so introduces carefully tuned dichalcogenides as a platform strategy for specific bioreduction-based release.",

    "abstract": "The tetrameric tumor suppressor p53 represents a great challenge for 3D-structural analysis due to its high degree of intrinsic disorder (ca. 40%). We aim to shed light on the structural and functional roles of p53s C-terminal region in full-length, wild-type human p53 tetramer and their importance for DNA binding. For this, we employed complementary techniques of structural mass spectrometry (MS) in an integrated approach with AI-based computational modeling. Our results show no major conformational differences in p53 between DNA-bound and DNA-free states, but reveal a substantial compaction of p53s C-terminal region. This supports the proposed mechanism of unspecific DNA binding to the C-terminal region of p53 prior to transcription initiation by specific DNA binding to the core domain of p53. The synergies between complementary structural MS techniques and computational modeling as pursued in our integrative approach is envisioned to serve as general strategy for studying intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered region (IDRs).",

    "abstract": "I.Multiple genetic modifications may be required to develop potent off-the-shelf chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapies. Conventional CRISPR-Cas nucleases install sequence-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), enabling gene knock-out (KO) or targeted transgene knock-in (KI). However, simultaneous DSBs provoke a high rate of genomic rearrangements which may impede the safety of the edited cells. Here, we combine a non-viral CRISPR-Cas9 nuclease-assisted KI and Cas9-derived base editing technology for DSB free KOs within a single intervention. We demonstrate efficient insertion of a CAR into the T cell receptor alpha constant (TRAC) gene, along with two KOs that silence major histocompatibility complexes (MHC) class I and II expression. This approach reduced translocations to 1.5% of edited cells. Small insertions and deletion at the base editing target sites indicated guide RNA exchange between the editors. This was overcome by using CRISPR enzymes of distinct evolutionary origins. Combining Cas12a Ultra for CAR KI and a Cas9-derived base editor enabled the efficient generation of triple-edited CAR T cells with a translocation frequency comparable to unedited T cells. Resulting T cell receptor- (TCR-) and MHC-negative CAR T cells resisted allogeneic T cell targeting in vitro. Thus, we demonstrate a solution for safer multiplex-edited cell products and a path towards off-the-shelf CAR therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are active cells that respond to neurotransmitters with elevations in their intracellular calcium concentration (calcium signals). In a tripartite synapse involving two neurons coupled by a glutamatergic synapse and one astrocyte, glutamate released by the presynaptic neuron can generate calcium signals in the astrocyte, which in turn trigger the release of neuroactive molecules (gliotransmitters) by the astrocyte that bind to receptors in the pre- and postsynaptic neuron membranes and modulate synaptic transmission. Astrocytic calcium signals can also be evoked by dopamine released in distant sites. Little is known about how dopamine modulates glutamatergic-evoked astrocyte activity. To investigate this question, we constructed compartmental astrocyte models with three different morphologies: linear (soma plus a single branch); branched (soma plus two branches); and bifurcated (soma plus a single branch that bifurcates into two branchlets). Compartments were modeled by conductance-based equations for membrane voltage and transport of ions, glutamate and dopamine between extra- and intracellular spaces. Glutamatergic and dopaminergic stimuli were modeled as Poisson processes with variable frequencies, and astrocyte responses were measured by number and location of evoked calcium signals. For cells with linear morphology, whole-cell dopaminergic stimulation reduced the glutamatergic stimulation frequency of distal compartments needed to generate calcium signals. For both the branched and bifurcated morphologies, whole-cell dopaminergic stimulation together with glutamatergic stimulation of one of the processes reduced the glutamatergic stimulation frequency necessary to trigger a calcium signal in the other process. The same glutamatergic stimulation protocols without dopamine stimulation required higher glutamatergic input frequencies to evoke calcium signals. Our results suggest that dopamine facilitates the occurrence of glutamatergic-evoked calcium signals, and that dopamine-glutamate interaction can control the distribution of calcium signals along the astrocyte extension.\n\nAuthor summaryAstrocytes are brain cells that are not electrically excitable as neurons but display chemical excitability in the form of transient rises in the intracellular calcium concentration (calcium signals) evoked by neurotransmitters. A tripartite synapse consists of pre- and postsynaptic terminals ensheathed by astrocyte processes. Neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic neuron can generate calcium signals in the astrocyte, which in turn trigger the release of neuroactive molecules (gliotransmitters) by the astrocyte that bind to receptors in the pre- and postsynaptic membranes and modulate synaptic transmission. Two neurotransmitters that can evoke astrocytic calcium signals are glutamate, the major neurotransmitter of excitatory synapses, and dopamine, an important modulatory neurotransmitter that can diffuse to wider regions than the synaptic release site. Little is known about how dopamine modulates glutamatergic-evoked astrocyte activity, and here we investigate this question using computational modeling. We constructed compartmental astrocyte models with three different morphologies: linear, with a single branch emanating from soma; branched, with two branches emanating from soma; and bifurcated, with a branch emanating from soma that bifurcates into two branchlets. Compartments were modeled by conductance-based equations for membrane voltage and transport of ions (sodium, potassium and calcium), glutamate and dopamine between extra- and intracellular spaces. Glutamatergic and dopaminergic stimuli were modeled as Poisson processes with variable frequencies. Astrocyte models with the three morphologies were submitted to similar stimulation protocols to compare their responses, which were measured in terms of the frequency and location of evoked calcium signals. For cells with linear morphology, dopaminergic stimulation of the entire cell (to simulate the diffuse action of dopamine) reduced the glutamatergic stimulation frequency of distal compartments (which simulates glutamatergic input from presynaptic neuron) needed to generate calcium signals. For both the branched and bifurcated morphologies, dopaminergic stimulation of the whole cell together with glutamatergic stimulation of the distal portions of one of the processes reduced the glutamate stimulation frequency necessary to trigger a calcium signal in the distal portions of the other process. Repetitions of the glutamatergic stimulation protocols without whole cell dopaminergic stimulation showed that higher glutamatergic input frequencies were needed to evoke calcium signals. Our results suggest that dopamine facilitates the occurrence of calcium signals evoked by glutamatergic inputs, and that interaction between dopamine and glutamate can control the distribution of calcium signals along the astrocyte extension.",

    "abstract": "Face-to-face communication improves the quality and accuracy of heard speech, particularly in noisy environments. Silent lipreading modulates activity in auditory regions, which has been hypothesized to reflect the transformation and encoding of multiple forms of visual speech information used to support hearing processes. Evidence suggests visual timing information as one such signal encoded in auditory areas: seeing when a speakers lips come together between words can help listeners parse word-level boundaries. However, it remains unclear how lipreading alters activity in the auditory system to improve speech perception at the single word-level. Using fMRI and intracranial electrodes in patients, here we show that silently lipread words can be classified from neural activity in auditory areas based on distributed spatial information. Lipread words evoked similar representations to the corresponding heard words, consistent with the prediction that automatic lipreading refines the tuning of auditory representations. Similar to heard words, lipread words varied in the distinctiveness of their neural representations in auditory cortex: e.g., the lipread words DIG and GIG evoked more similar neural activity in auditory cortex relative to the more perceptually distinct word FIG, suggesting that lipreading activity reflects probabilistic distributions as opposed to the unique identity of the lipread word. Notably, while visual speech has both excitatory and suppressive effects on auditory firing rates, classification was observed in both neural populations, consistent with the prediction that lipreading contributes to phoneme population tuning by both activating the corresponding representation and suppressing incorrect phonemic representations. These results support a model in which the auditory system combines the joint neural distributions evoked by heard and lipread words to generate a more precise estimate of what was said, particularly during noisy speech.",

    "abstract": "Emotional responses arise from limbic circuits including the hippocampus and amygdala. In the human brain, beta-frequency communication between these structures correlates with self-reported mood and anxiety. However, both the mechanism and significance of this biomarker as a readout vs. driver of emotional state remain unknown. Here we show that beta-frequency communication between the ventral hippocampus and basolateral amygdala also predicts anxiety-related behavior in mice on both long timescales ([~]30 min) and immediately preceding behavioral choices. Genetically encoded voltage indicators reveal that this biomarker reflects synchronization between somatostatin interneurons across both structures. Indeed, synchrony between these neurons dynamically predicts approach vs. avoidance, and optogenetically shifting this synchronization by just 25 msec is sufficient to bidirectionally modulate anxiety-related behaviors. Thus, back-translation establishes a human biomarker as a causal determinant (not just predictor) of emotional state, revealing a novel mechanism whereby interregional synchronization that is frequency-, phase- and cell type-specific controls anxiety processing.",

    "abstract": "In monogamous species, prosocial behaviors directed towards partners are dramatically different from those directed towards unknown individuals and potential threats. Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens plays an important role in guiding social behavior, however, its role in real time social decision making in a monogamous species remains largely unknown. We used monogamous prairie voles to investigate how dopamine release differs in voles when seeking and interacting with a pair bonded partner or a novel vole. Employing the sub-second temporal resolution of the fluorescent biosensor, GRABDA, during a social operant task, we found that partner seeking, anticipation, and interaction resulted in more dopamine release than the same events directed towards a novel vole. Furthermore, partner-elicited dopamine release decreases after prolonged partner separation. Thus, differences in partner- and novel-elicited dopamine release reflect the selective nature of pair bonds and may drive the social behaviors that reinforce and cement bonds over time, eroding after partner loss to facilitate new bond formation.",

    "abstract": "The formation of buds on the cell membrane of budding yeast cells is thought to be driven by reactions and diffusion involving the protein Cdc42. These processes can be described by a coupled system of partial differential equations known as the Schnakenberg system. The Schnakenberg system is known to exhibit diffusion-driven pattern formation, thus providing a mechanism for bud formation. However, it is not known how the accumulation of bud scars on the cell membrane affect the ability of the Schnakenberg system to form patterns. We have approached this problem by modelling a bud scar on the cell membrane with a hole on the sphere. We have studied how the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, which determines the resulting pattern, is affected by the size of the hole, and by numerically solving the Schnakenberg system on a sphere with a hole using the finite element method. Both theoretical predictions and numerical solutions show that pattern formation is robust to the introduction of a bud scar of considerable size, which lends credence to the hypothesis that bud formation is driven by diffusion-driven instability.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all trait-associated variants identified in GWAS are non-coding. The cis regulatory effects of these variants have been extensively characterized, but how they impact gene regulation in trans has been the subject of much fewer studies. Mapping trans genetic effects is very challenging because their effect sizes tend to be small and a large multiple testing burden reduces the power to detect them. In addition, read mapping biases can lead to many false positives. To reduce mapping biases and substantially improve power to map trans-eQTLs, we developed a pipeline called trans-PCO, which combines careful read and gene filters with a principal component (PC)-based multivariate association test. Our simulations demonstrate that trans-PCO substantially outperforms existing trans-eQTL mapping methods, including univariate and primary PC-based methods. We applied trans-PCO to two gene expression datasets from whole blood, DGN (N = 913) and eQTLGen (N = 31,684), to identify trans-eQTLs associated with gene co-expression networks and hallmark gene sets representing well-defined biological processes. In total, we identified 14,985 high-quality trans-eQTLs associated with 197 co-expression gene modules and biological processes. To better understand the effects of trait-associated variants on gene regulatory networks, we performed colocalization analyses between GWAS loci of 46 complex traits and trans-eQTLs identified in DGN. We highlight several examples where our map of trans effects helps us understand how trait-associated variants impact gene regulatory networks and biological pathways. For example, we found that a locus associated with platelet traits near ARHGEF3 trans-regulates a set of co-expressed genes significantly enriched in the platelet activation pathway. Additionally, six red blood cell trait-associated loci trans-regulate a gene set representing heme metabolism, a crucial process in erythropoiesis. In conclusion, trans-PCO is a powerful and reliable tool that detects trans regulators of cellular pathways and networks, which opens up new opportunities to learn the impact of trait-associated loci on gene regulatory networks.",
