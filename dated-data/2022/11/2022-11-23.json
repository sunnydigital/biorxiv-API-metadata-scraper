    "abstract": "The transcription factor NF-{kappa}B plays a pivotal role in the adaptive immune response. Pathogenic variants in NFKB1 are the most common genetic etiology of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Patients frequently present with impaired terminal B cell differentiation, autoimmunity, and hyperinflammatory immune dysregulation. NF-{kappa}B signaling and target gene expression are expected to be dysregulated in NFKB1-mutated patients. Here, we performed a multi-omics characterization of B cells from a cohort of clinically affected and unaffected NFKB1 mutation carriers. Our analysis identified specific epigenetic dysregulation and gene expression differences on B cells from NFKB1-mutated patients. We observed an aberrant expression of negative regulators of NF-{kappa}B signaling in NFKB1 mutation carriers, which may be a key factor for the autoinflammatory phenotype of these patients. Moreover, our analysis points towards a dysregulation of XBP1 and BCL3, key players of B cell activation and proliferation at different stages of B cell differentiation. The reduced expression of negative regulators of the NF-{kappa}B network is likely to be one of several mechanisms responsible for the aberrant NF-{kappa}B signaling, which impairs the maintenance of a normal humoral immune response. In summary, our findings highlight epigenetic and gene expression changes in B cells associated with NFKB1 mutations. Our data give insight into future therapeutic opportunities for patients with NFKB1 (haplo)insufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Sulfate-coupled anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is performed by multicellular consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) in obligate syntrophic partnership with sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Diverse ANME and SRB clades co-associate but the physiological basis for their adaptation and diversification is not well understood. In this work, we explore the metabolic adaptation of four syntrophic SRB clades (HotSeep-1, Seep-SRB2, Seep-SRB1a and Seep-SRB1g) from a phylogenomics perspective, tracing the evolution of conserved proteins in the syntrophic SRB clades, and comparing the genomes of syntrophic SRB to their nearest evolutionary neighbors in the phylum Desulfobacterota. We note several examples of gain, loss or biochemical adaptation of proteins within pathways involved in extracellular electron transfer, electron transport chain, nutrient sharing, biofilm formation and cell adhesion. We demonstrate that the metabolic adaptations in each of these syntrophic clades are unique, suggesting that they have independently evolved, converging to a syntrophic partnership with ANME. Within the clades we also investigated the specialization of different syntrophic SRB species to partnerships with different ANME clades, using metagenomic sequences obtained from ANME and SRB partners in individual consortia after fluorescent-sorting of cell aggregates from anaerobic sediments. In one instance of metabolic adaptation to different partnerships, we show that Seep-SRB1a partners of ANME-2c appear to lack nutritional auxotrophies, while the related Seep-SRB1a partners of a different methanotrophic archaeal lineage, ANME-2a, are missing the cobalamin synthesis pathway, suggesting that the Seep-SRB1a partners of ANME-2a may have a nutritional dependence on its partner. Together, our paired genomic analysis of AOM consortia highlights the specific adaptation and diversification of syntrophic SRB clades linked to their associated ANME lineages.",

    "abstract": "The Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, includes interfertile surface-dwelling and cave-dwelling morphs, enabling powerful studies aimed at uncovering genes involved in the evolution of cave-associated traits. Compared to surface fish, cavefish harbor several extreme traits within their skull, such as a protruding lower jaw, a wider gape, and an increase in tooth number. These features are highly variable between individual cavefish and even across different cavefish populations. To investigate these traits, we created a novel feeding behavior assay wherein bite impressions could be obtained. We determined that fish with an underbite leave larger bite impressions with an increase in the number of tooth marks. Capitalizing on the ability to produce hybrids from surface and cavefish crosses, we investigated genes underlying these segregating orofacial traits by performing Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) analysis with F2 hybrids. We discovered significant QTL for bite (underbite vs. overbite) that mapped to a single region of the Astyanax genome. This work highlights cavefish as a valuable genetic model for orofacial patterning and will provide insight into the genetic regulators of jaw and tooth development.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved cohesin complex mediates sister chromatid cohesion and facilitates mitotic chromosome condensation, DNA repair, and transcription regulation. These biological functions require cohesins two ATPases, formed by the Smc1p and Smc3p subunits. Cohesins ATPase activity is stimulated by the Scc2p auxiliary factor. This stimulation is inhibited by Eco1p acetylation of Smc3p at an interface with Scc2p. It was unclear how cohesins ATPase activity is stimulated by Scc2p, or how acetylation inhibits Scc2p, given that the acetylation site is distal to cohesins ATPase active sites. Here, we identify mutations in budding yeast that suppressed the in vivo defects caused by Smc3p acetyl-mimic and acetyl-defective mutations. We provide compelling evidence that Scc2p activation of cohesin ATPase depends upon an interface between Scc2p and a region of Smc1p proximal to cohesins Smc3p ATPase active site. Furthermore, substitutions at this interface increase or decrease ATPase activity to overcome ATPase modulation by acetyl-mimic and - null mutations. Using these observations and a cryo-EM structure, we propose a model for regulating cohesin ATPase activity. We suggest that Scc2p binding to Smc1p causes a shift in adjacent Smc1p residues and ATP, stimulating the Smc3p ATPase. This stimulatory shift is inhibited through acetylation of the distal Scc2p-Smc3 interface.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionarily conserved antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) mediates a primary antiviral innate immunity preventing the infection of broad spectrum viruses in plants. However, the detailed mechanism in plants is still largely unknown, especially in important agricultural crops including tomato. On the other aspect, varieties of pathogenic viruses evolve to possess Viral Suppressor of RNA silencing (VSR) to suppress antiviral RNAi in host. Due to the prevalence of VSR, it is still skeptical that antiviral RNAi truly functions to prevent the invasion of natural wildtype viruses in plants and animals. In the research, it is for the first time we applied CRISPR-Cas9 to generate ago2a, ago2b or ago2ab mutants for two differentiated Solanum lycopersicum AGO2, one key effector in antiviral RNAi. We found that AGO2a but not AGO2b was significantly induced to inhibit the propagation of not only VSR-deficient Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) but also wildtype CMV-Fny in tomato, however, both AGO2a and AGO2b did not regulate disease induction after the infection of either virus. Our findings firstly reveal a prominent role of AGO2a in antiviral RNAi innate immunity in tomato and demonstrate that antiviral RNAi evolves to defend the infection of natural wildtype CMV-Fny in tomato, however AGO2a-mediated antiviral RNAi does not play major roles in promoting tolerance of tomato plants to CMV infection for maintaining health.",
