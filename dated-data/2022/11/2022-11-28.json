    "abstract": "Multidrug and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-Kp) are considered critical threats to global health and key traffickers of resistance genes to other pathogens. In Chile, although a sustained increase in CR-Kp infections has been observed, few strains have been described at the genomic level, lacking molecular details of their resistance and virulence determinants and the mobile elements mediating their dissemination. In this work, we studied the antimicrobial resistance and performed a comparative genomics analysis of ten CR-Kp isolates from the Chilean surveillance of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. High resistance to most of the antibiotics tested was observed among the isolates, five ST25, three ST11, one ST45, and one ST505, which harbored a total of 44 plasmids, many of them predicted to be conjugative and carrying genes conferring resistance to a variety of antibiotic, metals, and disinfectants. Ten plasmids encoding either KPC-2, NDM-1, or NDM-7 carbapenemases were characterized, including novel plasmids with increased resistance gene load and a novel genetic environment for blaKPC-2 gene. This corresponds to the first report of ST25 and ST45 Kp producing NDM-7 in South America, and of an ST505 CR-Kp worldwide, producing both NDM-7 and KPC-2. Moreover, we characterized a variety of genomic islands carrying virulence and fitness factors. These results provide baseline knowledge for the detailed understanding of molecular and genetic determinants behind antibiotic resistance and virulence of K. pneumoniae in Chile and South America.",

    "abstract": "Two group 2B {beta}-coronaviruses (sarbecoviruses) have caused regional and global epidemics in modern history. The mechanisms of cross protection driven by the sarbecovirus spike, a dominant immunogen, are less clear yet critically important for pan-sarbecovirus vaccine development. We evaluated the mechanisms of cross-sarbecovirus protective immunity using a panel of alphavirus-vectored vaccines covering bat to human strains. While vaccination did not prevent virus replication, it protected against lethal heterologous disease outcomes in both SARS-CoV-2 and clade 2 bat sarbecovirus HKU3-SRBD challenge models. The spike vaccines tested primarily elicited a highly S1-specific homologous neutralizing antibody response with no detectable cross-virus neutralization. We found non-neutralizing antibody functions that mediated cross protection in wild-type mice were mechanistically linked to FcgR4 and spike S2-binding antibodies. Protection was lost in FcR knockout mice, further supporting a model for non-neutralizing, protective antibodies. These data highlight the importance of FcR-mediated cross-protective immune responses in universal pan-sarbecovirus vaccine designs.",

    "abstract": "Cellular membraneless organelles termed ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules often are enriched in messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules relative to the surrounding cytoplasm. Yet, the spatial localization and diffusion of mRNAs in close proximity to phase separated RNP granules is not well understood. In this study, we performed single molecule fluorescence imaging experiments of mRNAs in live cells in the presence of two types of RNP granules, stress granules (SG) and processing bodies (PB), which are distinct in their molecular composition and function. We developed a new colocalization imaging algorithm that was employed to determine the accurate positions of individual mRNAs relative to the granules boundaries. We found that mRNA is often localized at granule boundaries, an observation consistent with recently published data1,2. We suggest that mRNA molecules become spontaneously confined at the RNP granule boundary similar to the adsorption of polymer molecules at liquid-liquid interfaces, which is observed in various technological and biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Exercise effectively prevents obesity-related disorders, but it is unclear whether the beneficial health effects of exercise are restricted to unique circadian windows. Therefore, we aimed to study whether timing of exercise training differentially modulates the development and progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease currently estimated to affect over two billion people worldwide. We endurance-trained high fat-high cholesterol-fed NAFLD-prone male APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice five times per week for eight weeks either in the early (ZT13) or in the late (ZT22) active phase and assessed the NAFLD score (histology) and hepatic inflammation compared to sedentary mice. Exercise training prevented an increase in body fat mass and fasting plasma glucose as expected, but neither early nor late training affected liver triglyceride or cholesterol content compared to sedentary mice, likely due to a very early stage of hepatic steatosis. In line, hepatic expression of de novo lipogenesis genes (e.g., Fasn, Srebp1c) was similarly downregulated by early and late training. However, exercise had a distinct time-dependent effect on hepatic inflammation, as only early training promoted an influx of pro-inflammtory cells into the liver paired with increased expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. Tnfa, Il1b). This data suggests that the timing of exercise is a critical factor for the effect on cardiometabolic disease development.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin states of genes and transposable elements (TEs) dictated by combinations of various histone modifications comprise key information for understanding the mechanisms of genome organization and regulation. However, little is known about the principles of their dynamic changes during development and evolution in a three-dimensional genome context. To address this, we study Drosophila pseudoobscura, a Drosophila model species that diverged from D. melanogaster about 25 million years ago. We collected 71 epigenomic datasets targeting 11 histone modification marks and 4 Hi-C datasets, and projected 15 chromatin states across four different developmental stages and two adult tissues. We estimate that before zygotic genome activation, 41% of the genome has already been deposited with histone modifications, while 20% of the rest genome switches from a  null state to an active/inactive chromatin state after the zygotic genome activation. Over two thirds of the genomic region exhibit at least one transition between different chromatin states during development. And such transitions on cis-regulatory regions are associated with tissue- or stage-specific formation of chromatin loops or topologically associated domain borders (TABs), as well as specific activation of gene expression. We further demonstrate that while evolutionarily young TEs are preferentially targeted by silencing histone modifications, old TEs are more frequently domesticated as TABs or specific enhancers that further contribute to the genome organization or local gene regulation. Interestingly, this trend is reversed on the newly evolved X chromosome in D. pseudoobscura, due to the acquisition of dosage compensation mechanism. Overall we characterize the developmental and evolutionary dynamics of Drosophila epigenomic states, and highlight the roles of certain TEs of different evolutionary ages in genome organization and regulation.",

    "abstract": "T. b. rhodesiense is the causative agent of rhodesian Human African trypanosomiasis (r-HAT) in Malawi. Clinical presentation of r-HAT in Malawi varies between the different foci and differs from East African HAT clinical phenotypes. The purpose of this study was to gain more insights into the transcriptomic profiles of patients with early stage 1 and late stage 2 HAT disease in Malawi. Whole blood from individuals infected with T. b. rhodesiense was used for RNA-Seq. Control samples were from healthy trypanosome negative individuals matched on sex, age range, and disease focus. Illumina sequence FASTQ reads were aligned to the GRCh38 release 84 human genome sequence using HiSat2 and differential analysis was done in R using the DESeq2 package. XGR, ExpressAnalyst and InnateDB algorithms were used for functional annotation and gene enrichment analysis of significant differentially expressed genes. RNA-seq was done on 25 healthy controls and 23 r-HAT case samples of which 3 case samples were excluded for downstream analysis as outliers. 4519 genes were significantly differentially expressed (p adjusted <0.05) in individuals with early stage 1 r-HAT disease (n = 12) and 1824 genes in individuals with late stage 2 r-HAT disease (n = 8). Enrichment of innate immune response genes through neutrophil activation was identified in individuals with both early and late stages of the disease. Additionally, lipid metabolism genes were enriched in late stage 2 disease. We further identified uniquely upregulated genes (log2 Fold Change 1.4 - 2.0) in stage 1 (ZNF354C) and stage 2 (TCN1 and MAGI3) blood. Our data brings new insight into the human transcriptome landscape during T. b. rhodesiense infection. We have further identified key biological pathways and transcripts during stage 1 and stage 2 r-HAT. Lastly, we have identified potential diagnostic biomarkers that may be used for staging of r-HAT disease.",

    "abstract": "Vimentin intermediate filaments form part of the cytoskeleton of mesenchymal cells, but under pathological conditions often associated with inflammation, vimentin filaments depolymerize as the result of phosphorylation or citrullination, and vimentin oligomers are secreted or released into the extracellular environment. In the extracellular space, vimentin can bind surfaces of other cells and the extracellular matrix, and the interaction between extracellular vimentin and other cell types can trigger changes in cellular functions, such as activation of fibroblasts to a fibrotic phenotype. The mechanism by which extracellular vimentin binds external cell membranes and whether vimentin alone can act as an adhesive anchor for cells is largely uncharacterized. Here, we show that various cell types (normal and vimentin null fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, A549 lung carcinoma cells) attach to and spread on polyacrylamide hydrogel substrates covalently linked to vimentin. Using traction force microscopy and spheroid expansion assays, we characterize how different cell types respond to extracellular vimentin. Cell attachment to and spreading on vimentin-coated surfaces is inhibited by hyaluronic acid (HA) degrading enzymes, HA synthase inhibitors, soluble heparin, or N-acetyl glucosamine, treatments that have little or no effect on the same cell types binding to collagen-coated hydrogels. These studies highlight the effectiveness of substrate-bound vimentin as a ligand for cells and suggest that carbohydrate structures, including the glycocalyx and glycosylated cell surface proteins that contain N-acetyl glucosamine, form a novel class of adhesion receptors for extracellular vimentin.",

    "abstract": "Lanthipeptides are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides that are generated from precursor peptides through a dehydration and cyclization process in the biosynthetic pathways. In contrast to most other lanthipeptide synthetases, ProcM, a class II lanthipeptide synthetase, demonstrates high substrate tolerance. It is enigmatic that a single enzyme can catalyze the cyclization process of a diverse range of substrates with high fidelity. Previous studies suggested that the site-selectivity of lanthionine formation is determined by substrate sequence rather than by the enzyme. However, exactly how substrate sequence contributes to site-selective lanthipeptide biosynthesis is not clear. In this study, we performed molecular dynamic simulations for ProcA3.3 core peptide variants to explore how the predicted solution structure of the substrate without enzyme correlates to final product formation. Our simulation results support a model in which the secondary structure of the core peptide controls the ring pattern of the final product. We also demonstrate that the dehydration step in the biosynthesis pathway does not influence the site-selectivity of ring formation. In addition, we performed simulation for the core peptides of ProcA1.1 and 2.8, which are well-suited candidates to investigate the connection between order of ring formation and solution structure. Simulation results indicate that in both cases, C-terminal ring formation is more likely which was supported by experimental results. Our findings indicate that the substrate sequence and its solution structure can be used to predict the site-selectivity and order of ring formation, and that secondary structure is a crucial factor influencing the site-selectivity. Taken together, these findings will facilitate our understanding of the lanthipeptide biosynthetic mechanism and accelerate bioengineering efforts for lanthipeptide-derived products.",

At the level of the whole transcriptome, we find that adult cancers rarely return to an embryonic state, but rather that a foetal state is a near-universal feature of childhood cancers. We extend these bulk transcriptomic findings to a single cell resolution analysis of colorectal and liver cancers, confirming the lack of reversion to a primordial state in adult tumours and the retention of foetal signals in childhood cancers. Our findings provide a nuanced picture of dedifferentiation in these two groups of neoplasms, indicating cancer-specific rather than universal patterns of dedifferentiation pervade adult epithelial cancers.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDSystemic inflammation is a major contributor to poor brain pathology across many disease conditions. Specifically, the upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF in the hippocampus activates its receptor TNFR1, reducing AMPA receptor trafficking to impair LTP and associated behavioral outcomes. Studies using animal models of GWI have shown both a chronic upregulation of TNF and impaired neurological function. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether selectively inhibiting only the soluble form of TNF (solTNF) that preferentially activates TNFR1 can reverse neuroinflammation to improve neuroplasticity and neurological function.\n\nMETHODSGWI was induced in rats by treating with DFP (or vehicle) for 5 consecutive days. Six months later, the rats were treated with XPro1595 (or vehicle) for 2 weeks to selectively inhibit solTNF, after which they were subjected to a battery of behavioral tests (cognition, anxiety-related, depressive-like behavior, and neuropathic pain). MRI brain scans were performed, and the animals were euthanized for brain pathological analysis.\n\nRESULTSThe hippocampus of the GWI rats had significantly increased neuroinflammatory levels, resulting in edema and reduced AMPA receptor trafficking to the post-synaptic membrane that collectively promoted impairments in memory, anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and neuropathic pain. However, treating the rats with XPro1595 in the chronic environment attenuated the neuroinflammatory response, that reduced edema and impaired AMPA receptor trafficking, allowing for improvements in all areas of neurological function.\n\nCONCLUSIONOverall findings suggest that selectively inhibiting solTNF using XPro1595 reduces neuroinflammation, synaptic plasticity, and overall function when administered in the chronic setting of a rat model of GWI.

    "abstract": "Crowding occurs when the presence of nearby features causes highly visible objects to become unrecognizable. Although crowding has implications for many everyday tasks and the tremendous amounts of research reflect its importance, surprisingly little is known about how depth affects crowding. Most available studies show that stereoscopic disparity reduces crowding, indicating that crowding may be relatively unimportant in three-dimensional environments. However, most previous studies tested only small stereoscopic differences in depth in which disparity, defocus blur, and accommodation are inconsistent with the real world. Using a novel multi-depth plane display, this study investigated how large (0.54 - 2.25 diopters), real differences in target-flanker depth, representative of those experienced between many objects in the real world, affect crowding. Our findings show that large differences in target-flanker depth increased crowding in the majority of observers, contrary to previous work showing reduced crowding in the presence of small depth differences. Furthermore, when the target was at fixation depth, crowding was generally more pronounced when the flankers were behind the target as opposed to in front of it. However, when the flankers were at fixation depth, crowding was generally more pronounced when the target was behind the flankers. These findings suggest that crowding from clutter outside the limits of binocular fusion can still have a significant impact on object recognition and visual perception in the peripheral field.",

    "abstract": "Past cognitive neuroscience studies using naturalistic stimuli have considered narratives holistically and focused on cognitive processes. In this study, we incorporated the narrative structure--the dramatic arc--as an object of investigation, to examine how engagement levels fluctuate across a narrative-aligned dramatic arc. We explored the possibility of predicting self-reported engagement ratings from neural activity and investigated the idiosyncratic effects of each phase of the dramatic arc on brain responses as well as the relationship between engagement and brain responses. We presented a movie excerpt following the six-phase narrative arc structure to female and male participants while collecting EEG signals. We then asked this group of participants to recall the excerpt, another group to segment the video based on the dramatic arc model, and a third to rate their engagement levels while watching the movie. The results showed that the self-reported engagement ratings followed the pattern of the narrative dramatic arc. Moreover, whilst EEG amplitude could not predict group-averaged engagement ratings, other features comprising dynamic inter-subject correlation, dynamic functional connectivity patterns and graph features were able to achieve this. Furthermore, neural activity in the last two phases of the dramatic arc significantly predicted engagement patterns. This study is the first to explore the cognitive processes behind the dramatic arc and its phases. By demonstrating how neural activity predicts self-reported engagement, which itself aligns with the narrative structure, this study provides insights on the interrelationships between narrative structure, neural responses, and viewer engagement.\n\nSignificance statementDramatic narratives follow a complex structure termed as the narrative arc. Here, we addressed the complexity of this structure in order to explore brain responses during narrative cognition. We examined the link between the narrative arc and its six phases with self-reported engagement, and whether brain responses elicited by a narrative can predict engagement levels. Our results showed that the group-averaged engagement ratings followed the dramatic arc model. EEG features predicted group-averaged engagement patterns and also engagement levels in the last two phases. This is the first study to characterize the narrative dramatic arc phases at the neural level. It contributes to the fields of cognitive narratology and neuroscience by extending current knowledge on how the brain responds to narratives.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterial infections, including those caused by members of the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex [MTC] and Nontuberculous mycobacteria [NTM], can induce widespread morbidity and mortality in people. Mycobacterial infections cause both a delayed immune response, which limits rate of bacterial clearance, and formation of granulomas, which contain bacterial spread, but also contribute to lung damage, fibrosis, and morbidity. Granulomas also limit access of antibiotics to bacteria, which may facilitate development of resistance. MTC members resistant to some or all antibiotics are estimated to account for a third of deaths from tuberculosis [TB], and newly developed antibiotics have already engendered resistance, pointing to the need for new therapeutic approaches. Imatinib mesylate, a cancer drug used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia [CML] that targets Abl and related tyrosine kinases, is a possible host-directed therapeutic [HDT] for mycobacterial infections, including TB. Here, we use the murine Mycobacterium marinum [Mm] infection model, which forms quantifiable granulomas on the tails, in conjunction with transcriptomic analysis of the tail lesions. The data indicate that imatinib induces gene signatures indicative of immune activation at early time points post infection that resemble those seen at later ones, suggesting that imatinib accelerates but does not substantially alter anti-mycobacterial immune responses. Moreover, focusing on the TNF pathway, which is induced by imatinib, we show that imatinib promotes cell survival in infected bone marrow-derived macrophages [BMDMs] in a manner that depends on caspase 8. Moreover, imatinib limits formation and growth of granulomas, an effect abrogated in mice lacking caspase 8. These data provide evidence for the utility of imatinib as an HDT for mycobacterial infections in accelerating immune responses, and limiting pathology associated with granulomas, and thus mitigating post-treatment morbidity.\n\nAuthor SummaryMycobacterial infections remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in humans; for example, Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mtb], the cause of tuberculosis [TB], kills [~]1.5 million and newly infects [~]10 million each year. Although most people effectively combat mycobacterial infections, treatment is compromised in at-risk individuals by an indolent immune response and chronic inflammation, which results in granulomas that encase the bacteria and limit spread. Granulomas also contribute to tissue damage and limit access of antibiotics to bacteria, which engenders resistance. We proposed using imatinib mesylate, a host directed therapeutic [HDT], against mycobacteria. Imatinib, a cancer therapeutic that inhibits Abl and related tyrosine kinases, alters intracellular transit of bacteria during infection. Using systems biology approaches in conjunction with murine infections with Mycobacterium marinum, a close genetic relative of Mtb that forms tail granulomas, we report that imatinib does not fundamentally alter the anti-mycobacteria immune response, but rather accelerates it. In addition, imatinib limits granuloma formation and growth, an effect abrogated in mice lacking caspase 8. These data highlight imatinib as a possible HDT for mycobacterial infections including TB with the capacity to augment the immune response in at-risk individuals, and limit granuloma growth, thereby limiting tissue damage.",

    "abstract": "The Kingella genus includes two pathogenic species, namely K. kingae and K. negevensis, as well as strictly commensal species. Both K. kingae and K. negevensis secrete a toxin called RtxA that is absent in the commensal species. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that the toxin-encoding operon rtxCrtxAtolC was acquired by a common ancestor of the pathogenic Kingella species and that a preexisting type I secretion system was co-opted for toxin export. Subsequent genomic reorganization distributed the toxin machinery across two loci, with 30-35% of K. kingae strains containing two copies of the rtxA toxin gene. The rtxA duplication is largely clonal and strongly associated with invasive disease. In assays with isogenic strains, a single copy of rtxA was associated with reduced virulence in vitro. This study establishes the critical steps in the evolutionary transition from commensal to pathogen, including horizontal gene transfer, co-option of an existing secretion system, and gene duplication.",

    "abstract": "The rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP) of Streptococcus mutans is known to play an essential role in cell division and biofilm formation. It has become increasingly apparent that the structure plays a role in protection against external stress, including an undefined role in oxidative stress. In this study, we demonstrate that the loss of RGP impairs the uptake of glucose and the susceptibility of S. mutans to lethal concentrations of iron, while at the same time, generates elevated content of intracellular iron, a prominent producer of reactive oxygen species. Intracellular iron levels were significantly higher in a strain lacking rhamnose production ({Delta}rmlD), compared to a strain deficient in components of the RGP production pathway ({Delta}rgpG). The seemingly paradoxical discrepancy between iron uptake and iron susceptibility may be partially explained by increased expression of dpr and sod, genes that protect against oxidative stress and prime S. mutans against oxidative stressors such as H2O2 and superoxide. Analysis of the promoter of the rhamnose biosynthesis gene rmlD indicated the presence of regulatory motifs, including Rex and PerR, which we have shown control expression for the genes responsible for rhamnose biosynthesis and RGP production. These results provide initial insights into the role that RGP plays in toleration of oxidative stress and suggest a complexity in regulation of the genes responsible for production of the RGP.\n\nImportanceDental caries, a disease caused by Streptococcus mutans, imposes significant healthcare burdens and productivity losses in the US. The outer structure of S. mutans, which is primarily composed of the rhamnose-glucose polysaccharide (RGP), is understudied, though it plays a crucial role in survival of the organism in response to environmental stress. Elucidating the protective role of RGP and the regulatory mechanisms that control the synthesis of RGP in S. mutans will lead to insights into the structure and function of cell wall polysaccharides in other streptococci. This study reveals a role for L-rhamnose, the building block of RGP, in mediating homeostasis of iron uptake, while the loss of rhamnose biosynthesis causes alterations in transcription of sod and dpr.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs have recently emerged as major players in host-bacterial pathogens interaction, either as part of the host defense mechanism to neutralize infection or as a bacterial arsenal aimed at subverting host cell functions. Here we identify the newly evolutionary emerged human microRNA miR-6762-5p as a new player in the host-Shigella interplay. A microarray analysis in infected epithelial cells allowed the detection of this miRNA exclusively during the late phase of infection. Conditional expression of miR-6762-5p combined with a transcriptome analysis indicated a role in cytoskeleton remodeling. Likewise, miR-6762-5p enhanced stress fibers formation through RhoA activation and in silico analysis identified several regulators of RhoA activity as potential direct transcriptional targets. We further showed that miR-6762-5p expression induces an increase in Shigella intercellular spreading, while miR-6762-5p inhibition reduced bacterial dissemination. Overall, we have identified a human-specific miR-6762-5p acting specifically at the Shigella dissemination step. We propose a model in which the expression of miR-6762-5p induces cytoskeleton modifications through RhoA activation to achieve a successful dissemination of Shigella in the host.",

    "abstract": "In Kimoto-style fermentation, a fermentation starter is produced before the primary brewing process to stabilize fermentation. Nitrate-reducing bacteria, mainly derived from brewing water, produce nitrite, and lactic acid bacteria such as Leuconostoc can proliferate because of their tolerance towards low temperature and their low nutritional requirements. Later, Lactobacillus becomes the dominant genus, leading to weakly acidic conditions that contribute to control yeasts and undesired bacterial contaminants. However, the sources of these microorganisms that play a pivotal role in Sake brewing have not yet been revealed. Thus, comprehensive elucidation of the microbiome is necessary. In this study, we performed 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing analysis after sampling from floor, equipment surfaces, and raw materials for making fermentation starters, including koji, and water in Tsuchida Sake brewery, Gunma, Japan. Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) between the external environments and the fermentation starter were compared, and it was verified that the microorganisms in the external environments, such as built environments, equipment surfaces, and raw materials in the sake brewery, were introduced into the fermentation starter. Furthermore, various adventitious microbes present in the fermentation starter of early days and from the external environments were detected in a nonnegligible proportion in the starter, which may impact the taste and flavor. These findings illuminate the uncharacterized microbial dark matter of sake brewing, the sources of microbes in Kimoto-style fermentation.",

    "abstract": "At the end of the last ice age, several Atlantic salmon populations got caught up in the lakes and other small waterbodies of the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the pattern of evolution shaping the landlocked salmon populations is different from the other anadromous salmons, which migrate between the sea and rivers. According to the theories of population genetics, the effect of genetic drift is expected to be more pronounced in the former compared to the latter. Here we examined this using the whole genome data of landlocked and anadromous salmon populations of Norway. Our results showed a 50-80% reduction in the genomic heterozygosity in the landlocked compared to anadromous salmon populations. The number and total size of the runs of homozygosity (RoH) segments of landlocked salmons were 2 to 8-fold higher than those of their anadromous counterparts. We found the former had a higher ratio of nonsynonymous-to-synonymous diversities than the latter. The investigation also revealed a significant elevation of homozygous deleterious Single Nucleotide Variants (SNVs) in the landlocked salmon compared to the anadromous populations. All these results point to a significant reduction in the population size of the landlocked salmons, which might have started after the last glacial epoch. Previous studies on terrestrial vertebrates observed similar signatures of a bottleneck when the populations from Island and the mainland were compared. Since landlocked waterbody such as ponds and lakes are geographically analogous to Islands for fish populations, the findings of this study suggest the similarity in the patterns of evolution between the two.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the outcome of evolution is a central goal of modern biology, yet, determining the relative contributions of deterministic events (i.e., selection) and stochastic events (i.e., drift and mutation) to the evolutionary process remains a major challenge. Systems where the same traits have evolved repeatedly provide natural replication that can be leveraged to study the predictability of molecular evolution and the genetic basis of adaptation. Although mutational screens in the laboratory have demonstrated that a diversity of genetic mutations can produce phenocopies of one another, in natural systems, similar genetic changes frequently underly the evolution of phenotypes across independent lineages. This suggests a substantial role for constraint and determinism in evolution and supports the notion that there may be characteristics which make certain mutations more likely to contribute to phenotypic evolution. Here we use large-scale whole genome resequencing in the Mexican tetra, Astyanax mexicanus, to demonstrate that selection has played a primary role in repeated evolution of both trait loss and trait enhancement across independent cave lineages. We identify candidate genes underlying repeated adaptation to caves and infer the mode of repeated evolution, revealing that selection on standing genetic variation and de novo mutations both contribute substantially to repeated adaptation. Finally, we show that genes with evidence of repeated evolution have significantly longer coding regions compared to the rest of the genome, and this effect is most pronounced in genes evolving convergently via independent mutations. Importantly, our findings provide the first empirical support for the hypothesis that genes with larger mutational targets are more likely to be the substrate of repeated evolution and indicate that features of the novel cave environment may impact the rate at which mutations occur.",

Our goal was to use extracellular electrophysiological recordings to confirm the chemosensory role of the tentacles in the great pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis. Employing a special twin channel suction electrode to improve signal-to-noise ratio, we applied three food odours (derived from earthworm-based food pellets, algae-based pellets, and fresh lettuce) to a reduced preparation of the tentacle while recording neuronal activity in the tentacle nerve. Responses were assessed by comparing average spike frequencies produced in response to saline flow with and without odours. Confirming the omnivorous nature of this gastropod, we report strong neuronal responses to earthworm-based food odours and mild neuronal responses to algae-based food odours. There were no clear neuronal responses produced when lettuce food odour or control saline was applied to the tentacle. Overall, our results provide strong evidence for the chemosensory role of the tentacles in L. stagnalis. While it is unclear whether the differences in neuronal responses can be explained by differing sizes, numbers, or populations of neurons, these results are a useful foundation for further study of peripheral nervous system function in gastropods.\n\nSummary StatementGreat pond snail tentacles send sensory signals to the brain in response to some (but not all) food odours.",

Our refinement over the currently available standard quasi steady state approximations (QSSA) seems to be valid for wide range of enzyme to substrate and inhibitor ratios. Further, we show that, the enzyme-inhibitor-substrate system can exhibit a complicated dynamical behavior with non-monotonic trend in the temporal depletion of the substrate and there is also a possibility of the occurrence of two steady states with respect to enzyme-substrate and enzyme-inhibitor complexes. We define the ratios fS ={nu} max/(KMS + e0) and fS = umax/(KMI + e0) as the acceleration factors with respect to the conversion dynamics of substrate and inhibitor into their respective products. Here KMS and KMI are the Michaelis-Menten parameters associated with the binding of substrate and inhibitor with the enzyme, vmax and umax are the respective maximum reaction velocities. When fS/fI < 1, then the enzyme-substrate complex can reach the full-fledged steady state only after the depletion of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. On the other hand, when fS/fI > 1 then the enzyme-inhibitor complex can reach the full-fledged steady state only after the depletion of the enzyme-substrate complex. This complicated behavior of the enzyme-substrate-inhibitor system especially when fS/fI = 1 is the root cause of large amount of error in the estimation of various kinetic parameters both in the cases of fully and partially competitive inhibition schemes using the standard QSSA methods. Remarkably, we show that our refined expressions for the reaction velocities over enzyme-substrate-inhibitor space can control this error more significantly than the currently available standard QSSA velocity expressions.",

Here we asked whether direct vision and/or active movement of the hand can undo visuo-proprioceptive recalibration, and whether recalibration is still evident 24 hours later. 75 participants performed two blocks of visual, proprioceptive, and combination trials, with no feedback or direct vision of the hand. In Block 1, a 70 mm visuo-proprioceptive mismatch was gradually imposed, and recalibration assessed. Block 2 tested retention. Between blocks, Groups 1-4 rested or made active movements with their directly visible or unseen hand for several minutes. Group 5 had a 24-hour gap between blocks. All five groups recalibrated both vision and proprioception in Block 1, and Groups 1-4 retained most of this recalibration in Block 2. Interestingly, Group 5 showed an offline increase in proprioceptive recalibration, but retained little visual recalibration. Our results suggested that visuo-proprioceptive recalibration is robustly retained in the short-term. In the longer term, contextual factors may affect retention.",

    "abstract": "Neurobiological and psychological models of learning emphasize the importance of prediction errors (surprises) for memory formation. These effects have focused on memory for information surrounding a momentary surprising event; however, it is less clear whether surprise that unfolds across multiple events and timescales impacts memory. We asked basketball fans about their most positive and negative autobiographical memories of individual plays, games, and seasons, allowing surprise measurements spanning seconds, hours, and months. We used advanced analytics on National Basketball Association play-by-play data and betting odds spanning 17 seasons, >22K games, >5.6M plays to compute and align the estimated surprise values of each memory. We found that surprising events biased positive memories on the scale of seconds and months and negative memories across all three timescales. Critically, game and season memories could not be explained by surprise at shorter timescales, suggesting that long-term, multi-event surprise influences memory. These results expand the role of surprise in models of learning and reinforce its relevance in real-world domains.",

    "abstract": "Perinatal high fat diet (pHFD) exposure alters the development of vagal neurocircuits that control gastrointestinal (GI) motility and reduce stress resiliency in offspring. Descending oxytocin (OXT; prototypical anti-stress peptide) and corticotropin releasing factor (CRF; prototypical stress peptide) inputs from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) modulate the GI stress response. How these descending inputs, and their associated changes to GI motility and stress responses, are altered following pHFD exposure are, however, unknown. The present study used retrograde neuronal tracing experiments, in vivo recordings of gastric tone, motility, and gastric emptying rates, and in vitro electrophysiological recordings from brainstem slice preparations to investigate the hypothesis that pHFD alters descending PVN-DMV inputs and dysregulates vagal brain-gut responses to stress. Compared to controls, rats exposed to pHFD had slower gastric emptying rates and did not respond to acute stress with the expected delay in gastric emptying. Neuronal tracing experiments demonstrated that pHFD reduced the number of PVNOXT neurons that project to the DMV, but increased PVNCRF neurons. Both in vitro electrophysiology recordings of DMV neurons and in vivo recordings of gastric motility and tone demonstrated that, following pHFD, PVNCRF-DMV projections were tonically active, and that pharmacological antagonism of brainstem CRF1 receptors restored the appropriate gastric response to brainstem OXT application. These results suggest that pHFD exposure disrupts descending PVN-DMV inputs, leading to a dysregulated vagal brain-gut response to stress.\n\nSummary Figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=166 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517564v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7ad6acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a3cd04org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e8dc9borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eb7c7c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG KeypointsO_LIMaternal high fat diet exposure is associated with gastric dysregulation and stress sensitivity in offspring\nC_LIO_LIThe present study demonstrates that perinatal high fat diet exposure downregulates hypothalamic-vagal oxytocin (OXT) inputs but upregulates hypothalamic-vagal corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) inputs\nC_LIO_LIBoth in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that, following perinatal high fat diet, CRF receptors were tonically active at NTS-DMV synapses, and that pharmacological antagonism of these receptors restored appropriate gastric response to OXT\nC_LIO_LIThe current study suggests that perinatal high fat diet exposure disrupts descending PVN-DMV inputs, leading to a dysregulated vagal brain-gut response to stress.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The ability to flexibly select and accumulate relevant information to form decisions, while ignoring irrelevant information, is a fundamental component of higher cognition. Yet its neural mechanisms remain unclear. Here we demonstrate that, under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, the space of possible network mechanisms to implement this ability is spanned by the combination of three different components, each with specific behavioral and anatomical implications. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modeling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these components, suggesting that different individuals could use different component combinations. To study variations across subjects, we developed a rat task requiring context-dependent evidence accumulation, and trained many subjects on it. Our task delivers sensory evidence through pulses that have random but precisely known timing, providing high statistical power to characterize each individuals neural and behavioral responses. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioral analysis revealed remarkable heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. The theory further predicts a specific link between behavioral and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. Our results provide a new experimentally-supported theoretical framework to analyze biological and artificial systems performing flexible decision-making tasks, and open the door to the study of individual variability in neural computations underlying higher cognition.",

    "abstract": "Mitotic bookmarking transcription factors (TFs) are thought to mediate rapid and accurate post-mitotic gene reactivation. However, the loss of individual bookmarking TFs often leads to the deregulation of only a small proportion of their mitotic targets, raising doubts on the significance and importance of their bookmarking function. Here, we used targeted proteomics of the mitotic bookmarking TF ESRRB, an orphan nuclear receptor, to discover an unexpected redundancy among members of the protein superfamily of nuclear receptors. Focusing on the nuclear receptor NR5A2, which together with ES-RRB is essential for mouse pluripotency, we demonstrate conjoint bookmarking activity of both factors on promoters and enhancers of a large fraction of active genes, particularly the most rapidly and strongly reactivated ones. Upon fast and simultaneous degradation of both factors during mitotic exit, hundreds of mitotic targets of ESRRB/NR5A2, including key players of the pluripotency network, display attenuated transcriptional reactivation. We propose that redundancy in mitotic bookmarking TFs, especially by nuclear receptors, confers robustness to the reestablishment of gene regulatory networks after mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Glucose is a universal energy currency for living organisms, however, its non-energetic functions in processes such as differentiation are undefined. In epidermis, differentiating cells exhibit dynamic changes in gene expression1-4 driven by specific transcription factors (TFs)5-9. The interplay between such TFs and biomolecules that also change in this process is not understood. Metabolomic analyses revealed that increased intracellular glucose accompanies differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. This elevation also occurred in differentiating cells from other tissues and was verified in epidermal tissue engineered with glucose sensors, which detected a glucose gradient that peaked in the outermost differentiated layers. Free glucose accumulation, unaccompanied by its increased metabolism, was essential for epidermal differentiation and required GLUT1, GLUT3, and SGLT1 transporters. Glucose affinity chromatography and azido-glucose click chemistry uncovered glucose binding to diverse regulatory proteins, including the IRF6 TF, whose epidermal knockout confirmed its requirement in glucose-dependent differentiation. Direct glucose binding enabled IRF6 dimerization, DNA binding, genomic localization, and induction of IRF6 target genes, including essential pro-differentiation TFs GRHL1, GRHL3, HOPX and PRDM1. The IRF6R84C mutant found in undifferentiated cancers was unable to bind glucose. These data identify a new role for glucose as a gradient morphogen that modulates protein multimerization in cellular differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Tissue-resident macrophages are highly heterogenous and perform various dedicated functions depending on their locations. In particular, skin resident macrophages have intriguing roles in long-distance intercellular signaling by mediating cellular protrusions called  airinemes in zebrafish. During pigment pattern formation, macrophages relay signaling molecules containing  airineme vesicles from one pigment cell to another. Without macrophages, airineme-mediated signaling is abolished, disrupting pigment pattern formation. It remains unknown, however, if the same macrophage population controls both these signaling roles and typical immune functions or if a separate macrophage subpopulation functions in intercellular communication. In this study, with high-resolution confocal live-imaging and cell type-specific genetic ablation approaches in vivo, we have identified a macrophage subpopulation responsible for airineme-mediated signaling. These cells appear distinct from conventional skin resident macrophages by their amoeboid morphology and faster/expansive migratory behaviors. Instead, we show that they resemble ectoderm-derived macrophages termed metaphocytes. Metaphocyte ablation dramatically reduces airineme extension and signaling. In addition, these amoeboid/metaphocytes require high levels of MMP9 expression for their migration and airineme-mediated signaling. These results reveal a novel macrophage subpopulation with specialized functions in airineme-mediated signaling, which may play roles in many other aspects of intercellular communication.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections are the primary drivers of cervical cancers, and often the HPV DNA gets integrated into the host genome. Although the oncogenic impact of HPV encoded genes (such as E6/E7) is well known, the cis-regulatory effect of integrated HPV DNA on host chromatin structure and gene regulation remains less understood. Here, we investigate the genome-wide patterns of HPV integrations and associated host gene expression changes in the context of chromatin states and topologically associating domains (TADs). We find that HPV integrations are significantly enriched and depleted in active and inactive chromatin regions, respectively. Interestingly, regardless of the chromatin state, the genomic regions flanking HPV integrations showed transcriptional upregulation. Nevertheless, the upregulation (both local and long-range) is mostly confined to the TADs with integration and does not affect the adjacent TADs. Few TADs showed recurrent integrations associated with overexpression of oncogenes within them (such as MYC, PVT1, TP63 and ERBB2), regardless of the proximity. To further understand the long-range effect, we performed HiC and 4C-seq analyses in HeLa and observed chromatin looping interaction between the integrated HPV and MYC/PVT1 regions (situated [~]500 kb apart), leading to allele-specific overexpression of these genes. Again, these chromatin interactions involving integrated HPV are mostly observed within the same TAD. Together, these results suggest the cis-regulatory potential of integrated HPV DNA that drives host gene upregulation at intra-TAD level in cervical cancer. Based on this, we propose HPV integrations can trigger multimodal oncogenic activation to promote cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "High throughput sequencing of adaptive immune receptor repertoire (AIRR-seq) has provided numerous human immunoglobulin (IG) sequences allowing specific B cell receptor (BCR) studies such as the antigen-driven evolution of antibodies (soluble forms of the membrane-bound IG part of the BCR). AIRR-seq data allows researchers to examine intraclonal differences caused primarily by somatic hypermutations in IG genes and affinity maturation. Exploring this essential adaptive immunity process could help elucidate the generation of antibodies with high affinity or broadly neutralizing activities. Retracing their evolutionary history could also help to clarify how vaccines or pathogen exposition drive the humoral immune response. Computational methods are necessary for large-scale analysis of AIRR-seq properties. However, there is no efficient and interactive tool for analyzing intraclonal diversity, permitting users to explore adaptive immune receptor repertoires in biological and clinical applications. Here we developed ViCloD, a web server for large-scale visual analysis of repertoire clonality and intraclonal diversity. ViCloD uses data preprocessed by IMGT/HighV-QUEST and performs clonal grouping and evolutionary analyses, producing a collection of useful plots. The web server presents diverse functionalities, including repertoire navigation, clonal abundance analysis, and intraclonal evolutionary tree reconstruction. Users can download the analyzed data in different table formats and save the generated plots as images. ViCloD is a simple, versatile, and user-friendly tool that can help researchers and clinicians to analyze B cell intraclonal diversity.

A candidate mechanism is the disinhibition of pyramidal cells through vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and somatostatin (SOM) positive interneurons. However, the interaction of attentional modulation and VIP-SOM disinhibition has never been directly tested. We used all-optical methods to bi-directionally manipulate VIP interneuron activity as mice performed an attention switching task. We measured the activity of VIP, SOM and parvalbumin (PV) positive interneurons and pyramidal neurons identified in the same tissue and found that although activity in all cell classes was modulated by both attention and VIP manipulation, their effects were orthogonal. Attention and VIP-SOM disinhibition relied on distinct patterns of changes in activity and reorganisation of interactions between inhibitory and excitatory cells.

    "abstract": "Adaptation to ocean climate is increasingly recognized as an important driver of diversity in marine species despite the lack of physical barriers to dispersal and the presence of pelagic stages in many taxa. A robust understanding of the genomic and ecological processes involved in structuring populations is lacking for most marine species, often hindering management and conservation action. Cunner (Tautogolabrus adspersus), is a temperate reef fish that displays both pelagic early life history stages and strong site-associated homing as adults; the species is also presently of interest for use as a cleaner fish in salmonid aquaculture in Atlantic Canada. Here we produce a chromosome-level genome assembly for cunner and characterize spatial population structure throughout Atlantic Canada using whole genome resequencing. The genome assembly spanned 0.72 Gbp and resolved 24 chromosomes; whole genome resequencing of 803 individuals from 20 locations spanning from Newfoundland to New Jersey identified approximately 11 million genetic variants. Principal component analysis revealed four distinct regional groups in Atlantic Canada, including three near the range edge in Newfoundland. Pairwise FST and selection scans revealed consistent signals of differentiation and selection at discrete genomic regions including adjacent peaks on chromosome 10 recurring across multiple pairwise comparisons (i.e., FST 0.5-0.75). Redundancy analysis suggested significant association of environmental variables related to benthic temperature and oxygen range with genomic structure, again highlighting the previously identified region on chromosome 10. Our results suggest that climate associated adaptation in this temperate reef fish drives regional diversity despite high early life history dispersal potential.",

    "abstract": "Cilia are found in eukaryotic species ranging from single-celled organisms, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to humans, but not in plants. The ability to respond to repellents and/or attractants, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, and provide cellular mobility are just a few examples of how crucial cilia are to cells and organisms. Over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. Because of the complexity of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required. In addition, disorders not yet known as ciliopathy but have genes that produce cilia localizing proteins have yet to be classified. Here we present CiliaMiner, a manually curated ciliopathy database that includes ciliopathy lists collected from articles and databases. Analysis reveals that there are 55 distinct disorders likely related to ciliopathy, with over 4000 clinical manifestations. Based on comparative symptom analysis and subcellular localization data, diseases are classified as primary, secondary, or atypical ciliopathies. CiliaMiner provides easy access to all of these diseases and disease genes, as well as clinical features and gene-specific clinical features, as well as subcellular localization of each protein. Additionally, the orthologs of disease genes are also provided for mice, zebrafish, Xenopus, Drosophila, and C. elegans.
