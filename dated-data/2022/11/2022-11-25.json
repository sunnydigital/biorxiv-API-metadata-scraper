    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the capture of gene expression heterogeneity and consequently cell-to-cell variability at the cell type level. Although different methods have been proposed to quantify cell-to-cell variability, it is unclear what the optimal statistical approach is, especially in light of challenging data structures that are unique to scRNA-seq data like zero inflation.\n\nResultsIn this study, we conducted a systematic evaluation of cell-to-cell gene expression variability using 14 different variability metrics that are commonly applied to transcriptomic data. Performance was evaluated with respect to data-specific features like sparsity and sequencing platform, biological properties like gene length, and the ability to recapitulate true levels of variability based on simulation and known biological gene sets like ribosomal genes and stably expressed genes. scran had the strongest all-round performance, and this metric was then applied to investigate the changes in cell-to-cell variability that occur during ageing. Studying ageing showcases the value of cell-to-cell variability as it is a genetically-regulated program that is influenced by stochastic processes.scRNA-seq datasets from hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and B lymphocytes and other cell types from this differentiation lineage were used with scran to identify the genes with consistent patterns of variable and stable expression profiles during differentiation. Furthermore, to understand the regulatory relationship for genes that were differentially-variable in their expression between young and old mice, we constructed networks using transcription factors and their known targets for HSC and B lymphocyte cells. Comparisons of these networks identified a shared TF Sfpi1 that although was seen to increase in gene expression variability in old mice versus young in both cell types, the corresponding targets were distinct and their gene expression variability had different directions between cell types.\n\nConclusionsThrough these analyses, we highlight the importance of capturing cell-to-cell gene expression variability in a complex biological process like differentiation and ageing, and emphasise the value and specificity of interpreting these findings at the level of individual cell types.",

    "abstract": "All land plants encode two isoforms of protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPO). While PPO1 is predominantly expressed in green tissues and its loss is seedling-lethal in Arabidopsis, the effects of PPO2 deficiency have not been investigated in detail. We identified two ppo2 T-DNA insertion mutants from publicly available collections, one of which (ppo2-2) is a knock-out mutant. While the loss of PPO2 did not result in any obvious phenotype, significant changes in PPO activity were measured in etiolated and root tissues. However, ppo1ppo2 double mutants are embryo-lethal. To shed light on possible functional differences between the two isoforms, PPO2 was overexpressed in the ppo1 background. Although the ppo1 phenotype was partially complemented, even strong overexpression of PPO2 was unable to fully compensate for the loss of PPO1. Analysis of its subcellular localization revealed that PPO2 is found exclusively in chloroplast envelopes, while PPO1 accumulates in thylakoid membranes. A mitochondrial localization of PPO2 in Arabidopsis was ruled out. Since A. thaliana PPO2 does not encode a cleavable transit peptide, integration of the protein into the chloroplast envelope must make use of a non-canonical import route. However, when a chloroplast transit peptide was fused to the N-terminus of PPO2, the enzyme was detected predominantly in thylakoid membranes, and was able to fully complement ppo1. Thus, the two PPO isoforms in Arabidopsis are functionally equivalent, but spatially separated. Their distinctive localizations within plastids thus enable the synthesis of discrete sub-pools of the PPO product protoprophyrin IX, which may serve different cellular needs.",

    "abstract": "The global recovery of pinniped populations is a conservation success. However, pinniped population recovery has increased human-wildlife conflict with fisheries, an issue often reported and requiring management, but one that lacks global synthesis. We conduct a meta-analysis to estimate the impacts of operational interactions (specifically, lost catch) between pinnipeds and fisheries. Where quantifiable interactions are reported (n = 36), on average fishers have a 33.7% chance of interacting with pinnipeds on any given fishing day, and 13.8% lost catch. We find a large degree of heterogeneity between studies, with some fisheries experiencing much more negative interactions than others. Specifically, smaller-scale fisheries using nets are up to twice as likely to have negative interactions and lose up to five times more catch compared to large-scale fisheries. We conclude that pinniped-fishery conflict is a substantial global issue, but its impacts are not uniform. To successfully manage long-term coexistence between pinnipeds and humans, explicit data quantifying operational interactions is required. Population recoveries can have unintended consequences for fisheries, and management of ecological, social and economic outcomes is needed for long-term coexistence.\n\nTeaserPinniped population recoveries have led to significant impacts on fisheries, but small-scale fisheries lose out most.",

    "abstract": "Synapse diversity has been described from different perspectives, ranging from the specific neurotransmitters released, to their diverse biophysical properties and proteome profiles. However, synapse diversity at the transcriptional level has not been systematically identified across all synapse populations in the brain. To quantify postsynaptic and identify specific synaptic features of neuronal cell types we combined the SynGO (Synaptic Gene Ontology) database with single-cell RNA sequencing data of the mouse neocortex. We show that cell types can be discriminated by synaptic genes alone with the same power as all genes. The cell type discriminatory power is not equally distributed across synaptic genes as we could identify functional categories and synaptic compartments with greater cell type specific expression. Synaptic genes, and specific SynGO categories, belonged to three different types of gene modules: gradient expression over all cell types, gradient expression in selected cell types and cell class- or type-specific profiles. This data provides a deeper understanding of synapse diversity in the neocortex and identifies potential markers to selectively identify synapses from specific neuronal populations.",

    "abstract": "Motility of organisms involves beating of cilia and flagella that are composed of doublet microtubules. The doublets are made of A- and B-tubules that fuse together at two junctions. Among these, the outer junction is made of tripartite tubulin connections, while the inner junction contains distinct non-tubulin elements. The latter includes Flagellar-associated protein 20 (FAP20) and Parkin co-regulated gene protein (PACRG) that together link the A- and B- tubules at the inner junction. While the structures of doublet microtubules reveal molecular details, their assembly is poorly understood and examining proteins at the junctions can provide important clues. In this study, we purified recombinant FAP20 and characterized its effects on microtubule dynamics by TIRF microscopy. Using in vitro reconstitution and cryo-electron microscopy, we conclusively show that FAP20 recruits free tubulin to the existing microtubule, where it mediates flexible lateral interactions between the microtubule lattice and tubulin dimers. Our structure of microtubule:FAP20:tubulin complex partially resembles the inner junction architecture, further providing insights into assembly steps involved in closure of B- tubule in a doublet microtubule.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial HflX is a conserved ribosome-binding GTPase involved in splitting ribosomal complexes accumulated under stress condition. However, the atomic details of its ribosomal interaction remain to be elucidated. In this work, we present a high-resolution structure of the E. coli 50S subunit bound with HflX. The structure reveals highly specific contacts between HflX and the ribosomal RNA, and in particular, an insertion loop of the N-terminal domain of HflX is situated in the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) and makes direct interactions with PTC residues. Interestingly, this loop displays steric clash with a few PTC-targeting antibiotics on the 50S subunit, such as chloramphenicol. Deletion of hflX results in hypersensitivity to chloramphenicol treatment, and a loop residue G154 of HflX is important for the observed chloramphenicol resistance. Overall, our results suggest that HflX could be a general stress response factor that functions in both stalled ribosome splitting and PTC antibiotic displacing.",

To avoid off-target binding, here we propose a web-based tool named CRISPRi-Functional Genomics for Prokaryotes (CRISPRi-FGP) for genome-scale sgRNA library design for prokaryotic organisms (http://www.thu-big.net/sgRNA_design/). For this tool, we established a powerful quality control principle that identifies off-target hits with high accuracy. Moreover, we established a built-in database containing 1,300 common prokaryotes as a design source. In addition, CRISPRi-FGP also supports sgRNA design for new organisms using uploaded reference files. Finally, we found that compared to existing sgRNA design tools, CRISPRi-FGP could identify off-target binding hits with higher precision.",

The Wnt/{beta}-catenin cascade is essential in articular cartilage development and homeostasis. It has proved that both overexpression and loss of {beta}-catenin lead to cartilage degeneration and OA symptoms. However, the mechanism of Wnt/{beta}-catenin balance in healthy cartilage remains unclear. In the present work, we confirmed that the Wnt/{beta}-catenin activation and PTHrP suppression in cartilage during the post-traumatic OA process. Then, we demonstrated that Wnt/{beta}-catenin upregulated PTHrP expression through binding to its promoter (P2), and induce mRNA (AT6) transcript expression, while PTHrP repressed Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity, and formed a Wnt/{beta}-catenin-PTHrP negative feedback loop in the very primary chondrocytes to maintain cartilage homeostasis. However, this negative feedback loop vanished in dedifferentiated chondrocytes, hypertrophic chondrocytes, and IL-1{beta} treated very primary chondrocytes. We further found that miR-106b-5p was increased in these \"aberrant\" chondrocytes and directly targeted PTHrP mRNA to abolish the feedback loop. PKC-{zeta} was activated by PTHrP through phosphorylation at Thr410/403, and subsequently induced {beta}-catenin phosphorylation and ubiquitination. Finally, we disclosed that exogenous PTHrP attenuated OA progression exogenous PTHrP attenuated OA progression. Together, these findings reveal that PTHrP is a vital mediator to keep Wnt/{beta}-catenin activity homeostasis in healthy cartilage through a negative feedback loop, and PTHrP might be a therapeutic target for OA and cartilage regeneration.",

Although in most patients the life-threatening symptoms of the acute stage resolve with immunotherapy, memory and executive functions remain altered for several months or years. A mechanistic explanation for these long-lasting cognitive effects is still lacking and previous animal models have not explored this effect.\n\nHere, we combined repeat calcium imaging of the same population of hundreds of hippocampal CA1 neurons for three months along with two behavioral tasks to assess retrograde and anterograde memory loss using a reported mouse model of cerebroventricular transfer of patients CSF antibodies. We measured how memory-related neuronal activity is affected by the presence of NMDAR antibodies during the induction of the model and its long-lasting recovery. In addition, we developed a computational model that provides a mechanistic explanation for the long-term antibody-mediated impairment of memory.\n\nThe findings show that the presence of antibodies leads to an increase of CA1 neuronal firing rate, resulting in a reduction of the amount of information encoded by these cells. Furthermore, the antibodies cause a degradation of the hippocampal neuronal response stability over time, providing a neural correlate of memory dysfunction. All these neuronal alterations span the 3 months of recordings, and in some cases beyond the last recording point. The computational model shows that a reduction of NMDAR is sufficient to cause the changes observed in neuronal activity, including the different involvement of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 neurons.\n\nAltogether, we show that the antibody-mediated reduction of NMDAR leads to long-term changes in hippocampal neuronal activity which extend far beyond the antibody clearance, providing a mechanism that can account for the cognitive deficits observed in the protracted recovery of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.",

    "abstract": "Hydrocephalus is a prevalent condition among newborns leading to substantial neurocognitive and motor impairment. Novel therapies are needed to supplant invasive surgeries, but identifying targetable cells and pathways remains a hurdle to devising alternative pharmacological options. Multiciliated ependymal cells (MECs) promote cerebrospinal fluid flow within brain ventricles, and their dysfunction is associated with various forms of hydrocephalus. Here we show that an acute exposure to TNF- strongly impairs the conversion of ependymal cell radial glial progenitors (ecRGPs) into MECs. Inhibition of MEC differentiation was correlated with elevated expression levels of notch pathway effectors normally downregulated prior to the transition of ecRGPs into MECs. TNF- inhibited Multicilin gene upregulation along with downstream genes critical for centriole amplification and multicilia formation, resulting in cells with greatly diminished basal bodies and multicilia. Treatment with notch inhibitor DBZ, either in parallel with TNF- or sequentially days later, rescued MEC differentiation and expression of genes required for multicilia formation. These results provide a rationale for how TNF can impair MEC development, and they offer a targetable pathway to the treatment of some forms of hydrocephalus.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) results from a CAG repeat expansion in the gene for Huntington (HTT) resulting in expansion of the polyglutamine (Q) tract in the mutant protein (mHTT). Synaptic changes are early manifestations of neuronal dysfunction in HD. However, the mechanism(s) by which mHTT impacts synapse formation and function is not well defined. Herein we explored HD pathogenesis in the BACHD and the {Delta}N17-BACHD mouse models of HD by examining cortical synapse formation and function in primary cultures maintained for up to 35 days (DIV35). We identified synapses by immunostaining with antibodies against pre-synaptic (Synapsin 1) and a post-synaptic (PSD95) marker. Consistent with earlier studies, cortical neurons from both WT and the HD models began to form synapses at DIV14; at this age there were no genotypic differences in synapse numbers. However, from DIV21 through DIV35 BACHD neurons showed progressively smaller numbers of synapses relative to WT neurons. Remarkably, BACHD synaptic deficits were completely rescued by treating cultures with BDNF. Building on earlier studies using reagents inspired by the chaperonin TRiC, we found that addition of the recombinant apical domain of CCT1 partially rescued synapse number. Unexpectedly, unlike BACHD cultures, synapses in {Delta}N17-BACHD cultures showed a progressive increase in number as compared to WT neurons, thus distinguishing synaptic changes in these HD models. Using multielectrode arrays, we discovered age-related functional deficits in BACHD cortical cultures with significant differences present by DIV28. As for synapse number, BDNF treatment prevented most synaptic deficits, including mean firing rate, spikes per burst, inter-burst interval, and synchrony. The apical domain of CCT1 showed similar, albeit less potent effects. These data are evidence that deficits in HD synapse number and function can be replicated in vitro and that treatment with either BDNF or a TRiC-inspired reagent can prevent them. Our findings support the use of cellular models to further explicate HD pathogenesis and its treatments.",

    "abstract": "Immune activation drives metabolic change in most animals. Immune-induced metabolic change is most conspicuous as a driver of pathology in serious or prolonged infection, but it is normally expected to be important to support immune function and recovery. Many of the signalling mechanisms linking immune detection with metabolic regulation, and their specific consequences, are unknown. Here, we show that Drosophila melanogaster respond to many bacterial infections by altering expression of genes of the folate cycle and associated enzymes of amino acid metabolism. The net result of these changes is increased flow of carbon from glycolysis into serine and glycine synthesis and a shift of folate cycle activity from the cytosol into the mitochondrion. Immune-induced transcriptional induction of astray and Nmdmc, the two most-induced of these enzymes, depends on Dif and foxo. Loss of astray or Nmdmc results in infection-specific immune defects. Our work thus shows a key mechanism that connects immune-induced changes in metabolic signalling with the serine-folate metabolic unit to result in changed immune function.",

    "abstract": "Extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC) can cause a variety of infections outside of the intestine and are a major causative agent of urinary tract infections. Treatment of these infections is increasingly frustrated by antimicrobial resistance (AMR) diminishing the number of effective therapies available to clinicians. Incidence of multi-drug resistance (MDR) is not uniform across the phylogenetic spectrum of E. coli. Instead AMR is concentrated in select lineages, such as ST131, which are MDR pandemic clones that have spread AMR globally. Using a gnotobiotic mouse model we demonstrate that an MDR E. coli ST131 is capable out-competing and displacing non-MDR E. coli from the gut in vivo. This is achieved in the absence of antibiotic treatment mediating a selective advantage. In mice colonised with non-MDR E. coli strains, challenge with MDR E. coli either by oral gavage or co-housing with MDR E. coli colonized mice results in displacement and dominant intestinal colonization by MDR E. coli ST131. To investigate the genetic basis of this superior gut colonization ability by MDR E. coli, we used a functional pangenomic analysis of 19,571 E. coli genomes revealing that carriage of AMR genes is associated with increased diversity in carbohydrate metabolism genes. The data presented here demonstrate that independent of antibiotic selective pressures, MDR E. coli display a competitive advantage to colonise the mammalian gut and points to a vital role of metabolism in the evolution and success of MDR lineages of E. coli via carriage and spread.",

    "abstract": "Summary/abstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSWith the advent of high-throughput sequencing, large sets of insect-infecting RNA viruses producing apparent asymptomatic infections are being discovered. In the Mediterranean fruit fly (medfly) Ceratitis capitata, an agricultural key pest of a wide range of fruits, up to 13 different RNA viruses have been described. Recent analysis demonstrated a wide distribution of these viruses in different medfly strains collected worldwide, but little is known about the interactions between those viruses and the medfly host. Previous studies suggested that a higher abundance of Ceratitis capitata nora virus (CcaNV) decreased medfly developmental time. Here, we investigated the effect of CcaNV on a broad range of parameters related to host fitness and its interaction with other trophic levels.\n\nResultsCcaNV purified from a naturally infected medfly strain was used to infect CcaNV-free flies orally and subsequently monitor pupal weight, adult emergence, flying ability and longevity. Our results revealed detrimental effects associated with a CcaNV infection in the medfly, in terms of reduced pupal weight and reduced adult longevity. Moreover, we tested the influence of a CcaNV infection in medflies on the parasitism performance of Aganaspis daci, a medfly endoparasitoid used in biological control programs against medflies. Our results showed that A. daci progeny increased when parasitizing on CcaNV-infected larvae.\n\nConclusionsOur results proved that covert RNA viruses can impact on the insect ecology, directly affecting its insect host biology and indirectly influencing multitrophic interactions.",

    "abstract": "Pesticide resistance relies on a myriad of mechanisms, ranging from single mutations to a complex and polygenic architecture, and it involves mechanisms such as target-site insensitivity, metabolic detoxification, or a combination of these, with either additive or synergistic effects. Several resistance mechanisms against abamectin, a macrocyclic lactone widely used in crop protection, have been reported in the cosmopolitan pest Tetranychus urticae. However, it has been shown that a single mechanism cannot account for the high levels of abamectin resistance found across different mite populations. Here, we used experimental evolution combined with bulked segregant analyses to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with abamectin resistance in two genetically unrelated strains of T. urticae. In these two independent QTL mapping experiments, three and four QTLs were identified, of which three were shared between experiments. Shared QTLs contained genes encoding subunits of the glutamate-gated chloride channel (GluCl) and harboured previously reported mutations, including G314D in GluCl1 and G326E in GluCl3, but also novel resistance candidate loci, including DNA helicases and chemosensory receptors. Surprisingly, the fourth QTL, present only in only one of the experiments and thus unique for one parental resistant strain, revealed a non-functional variant of GluCl2, suggesting gene knock-out as resistance mechanism. Our study uncovers the complex basis of abamectin resistance, and it highlights the intraspecific diversity of genetic mechanisms underlying resistance in a cosmopolitan pest.",

    "abstract": "Membrane protein and phospholipid (PL) composition changes in response to environmental cues and during infections. Covalent modification and remodelling of the acyl chain length of PLs is an important bacterial adaptation mechanism. However, little is known about which bacterial pathways are regulated in response to altered PL composition. Here, we showed that P. aeruginosa phospholipase A, PlaF, which modulates membrane PL composition, is important for biofilm biogenesis, and we performed whole-cell quantitative proteomics of P. aeruginosa wild-type and {Delta}plaF biofilms to identify pathways regulated by PlaF. The results revealed profound alterations in the abundance of several two-component systems (TCSs), including accumulation of PprAB, which controls the transition to biofilm. Furthermore, a unique phosphorylation pattern of transcriptional regulators, transporters and metabolic enzymes, as well as differential production of seven proteases, in {Delta}plaF, indicate that PlaF-mediated virulence adaptation involves complex transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation. Moreover, proteomics revealed the depletion of pyoverdine-mediated iron uptake pathway proteins in {Delta}plaF, which agrees with the decreased concentrations of extracellular pyoverdine and intracellular iron and is likely responsible for its prolonged lag growth phase, presumably due to reduced iron uptake. Conversely, the accumulation of proteins from alternative iron-uptake systems in {Delta}plaF suggests that PlaF may function as a switch between different iron-acquisition pathways. The observation that {Delta}plaF accumulates PL-acyl chain modifying and PL synthesis enzymes reveals novel insights into the role of PlaF for membrane PL homeostasis. Although the precise mechanism by which PlaF simultaneously affects multiple pathways remains to be elucidated, we suggest that PlaF-catalyses the degradation of PLs which then serve as a signal that is amplified by proteins of two-component, phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation systems to elicit the global adaptive response in P. aeruginosa.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWBread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop and its genome is one of the largest ever assembled at reference-quality level. It is 15 Gb, hexaploid, with 85% of transposable elements (TEs). Wheat genetic diversity was mainly focused on genes and little is known about the extent of genomic variability affecting TEs, transposition rate, and the impact of polyploidy. Multiple chromosome-scale assemblies are now available for bread wheat and for its tetraploid and diploid wild relatives. In this study, we computed base pair-resolved, gene-anchored, whole genome alignments of A, B, and D lineages at different ploidy levels in order to estimate the variability that affects the TE space. We used assembled genomes of 13 T. aestivum cultivars (6x=AABBDD), T. durum (4x=AABB), T. dicoccoides (4x=AABB), T. urartu (2x=AA), and Aegilops tauschii (2x=DD). We show that 5 to 34% of the TE fraction is variable, depending on the species divergence. Between 400 and 13,000 novel TE insertions per subgenome were detected. We found lineage-specific insertions for nearly all TE families in di- tetra- and hexaploids. No burst of transposition was observed and polyploidization did not trigger any boost of transposition. This study challenges the prevailing idea of wheat TE dynamics and is more in agreement with an equilibrium model of evolution.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic virulence of extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli is attributed to numerous chromosome and/or plasmid-borne virulence associated genes (VAGs), encoding diverse functions as adhesins, toxins, protectins and iron capture systems, which occur in specific genetic backgrounds. Little is however known on their respective contribution to virulence. Here, by analyzing genomes of 232 sequence type complex (STc) 58 strains, we show that virulence quantified in a mouse model of sepsis emerged in a sub-group of STc58 due to the presence of the siderophore encoding high-pathogenicity island (HPI). When extending our analysis to 370 Escherichia strains we show that full virulence is associated with the presence of the aer or sit operons, in addition to the HPI. The prevalence of these operons, their co-occurrence and genomic location depend on the strain phylogeny. Selection of lineage-dependent specific associations of VAGs argues for strong epistatic interactions shaping the emergence of virulence in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Intraspecific public goods are commonly shared within microbial populations, where the benefits of public goods are largely limited to closely related conspecifics. One example is the production of iron-scavenging siderophores that deliver iron to cells via specific cell envelope receptor and transport systems. Intraspecific social exploitation of siderophore producers is common, since non-producers avoid the costs of production but retain the cell envelope machinery for siderophore uptake. However, little is known about how interactions between species (i.e. interspecific interactions) can shape intraspecific public goods exploitation. Here, we predicted that strong competition for iron between species in diverse communities will increase costs of siderophore cooperation, and hence select for increased intraspecific exploitation. We examined how increasing microbial community species diversity shapes intraspecific social dynamics by monitoring the growth of siderophore producers and non-producers of the plant-growth promoting bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens, embedded within tree-hole microbial communities ranging from 2-15 species. We find, contrary to our prediction, that siderophore exploitation is reduced in high diversity communities, driven by increased likelihood of encountering key species that reduce the growth of siderophore non-producing (but not producing) strains of P. fluorescens. Our results suggest that maintaining a healthy soil microbiota could contribute to the maintenance of siderophore production in natural communities.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that cis-regulatory elements controlling gene expression may be the predominant target of natural selection in humans and other species. Detecting selection acting on these elements is critical to understanding evolution but remains challenging because we do not know which mutations will affect gene regulation. To address this, we devised an approach to search for lineage-specific selection on chromatin activity, transcription factor binding, and chromosomal looping--critical steps in transcriptional regulation. Applying this approach to lymphoblastoid cells from 831 individuals of either European or African descent, we find strong signals of differential chromatin activity linked to gene expression differences between ancestries in numerous contexts, but no evidence of functional differences in chromosomal looping. Moreover, we show that enhancers rather than promoters display the strongest signs of selection associated with sites of differential transcription factor binding. Overall, our study indicates that some cis-regulatory adaptation may be more easily detected at the level of chromatin than DNA sequence. This work provides a vast resource of genomic interaction data from diverse human populations and establishes a novel selection test that will benefit future study of regulatory evolution in humans and other species.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria swim using a flagellar motor that is powered by stator units. These stator units are energized by an ionic gradient across the membrane, typically proton or sodium. The presumed monodirectional rotation of the stator units allows the bidirectional rotation of the flagellar motor. However, how ion selectivity is attained, how ion transport triggers the directional rotation of the stator unit, and how the stator unit is incorporated into the motor remain largely unclear. Here we have determined by cryo-electron microscopy the structure of the Na+-driven type stator unit PomAB from the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus in both lipidic and detergent environments, at a resolution up to 2.5 [A]. The structure is in a plugged, auto-inhibited state consisting of five PomA subunits surrounding two PomB subunits. The electrostatic potential map uncovers sodium ion binding sites within the transmembrane domain, which together with functional experiments and explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations, suggest a mechanism for ion translocation and selectivity. Resolved conformational isomers of bulky hydrophobic residues from PomA, in the vicinity of key determinant residues for sodium ion coupling of PomB, prime PomA for clockwise rotation. The rotation is tightly blocked by the trans-mode organization of the PomB plug motifs. The structure also reveals a conformationally dynamic helical motif at the C-terminus of PomA, which we propose regulates the distance between PomA subunit cytoplasmic domains and is involved in stator unit-rotor interaction, concomitant stator unit activation, and torque transmission. Together, our studies provide mechanistic insight for understanding flagellar stator unit ion selectivity and incorporation of the stator units into the motor.",

    "abstract": "It has been suggested that the richness of conscious experience can be directly linked to the richness of brain state repertories. Brain states change depending on our environment and activities we engage in by taking both external and internally derived information into account. It has been shown that high-level sensory stimulation changes local brain activity and induces neural synchrony across participants. However, the dynamic interplay of cognitive processes that underlie moment-to-moment information processing remains poorly understood. Using naturalistic movies as an ecological laboratory model of the real world, here we assess how the processing of complex naturalistic stimuli alters the dynamics of brain networks interactions, and how these in turn support information processing. Participants underwent fMRI recordings during movie watching, scrambled movie watching, and rest. Measuring phase-synchrony between different brain networks, we computed whole-brain connectivity patterns. We showed that specific connectivity patterns were associated with each experimental condition. We found a higher synchronization of brain patterns across participants during movie watching compared to resting state and scrambled movie conditions. Moreover, synchronization increased during the most engaging parts of the movie. The synchronization dynamics across participants were associated with suspense; more suspenseful scenes induced higher synchronization. These results suggest that processing of the same high-level information elicits common neural dynamics among individuals and that whole-brain functional connectivity tracks variations in the processed information and the subjective experience.",

    "abstract": "A significant proportion of recurrent miscarriage, recurrent implantation failure and infertility are unexplained, and these conditions have been proposed to have an etiology of immunological dysfunction at the maternal-fetal interface. Uterine Natural Killer cells (uNK) comprise three subsets and are the most numerous immune cells found in the uterine mucosa at the time of implantation. They are thought to play an important role in successful pregnancy by regulation of extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion and spiral artery remodelling. Here, we examine the frequency, phenotype and function of uNK1-3 from the uterine mucosa of 16 women with unexplained reproductive failure compared to 11 controls with no reproductive problems, during the window of implantation. We report that KIR2DL1/S1 and LILRB1 expression is lower in the reproductive failure group for both uNK (total uNK, uNK 2 and 3) and pNK. We also show that degranulation activity is significantly reduced in total uNK, and that TNF- production is lower in all uNK subsets in the reproductive failure group. Taken together, our findings suggest that reproductive failure may be caused by global reduction in expression of uNK receptors important for interaction with HLA-C and HLA-G on EVT during early pregnancy, leading to reduced uNK activation. This is the first study to examine uNK subsets during the window of implantation in women with reproductive failure and will serve as a platform to focus on particular aspects of phenotype and function of uNK subsets in future studies. Further understanding of uNK dysregulation is important to establish potential diagnostic and therapeutic targets in the population of women with unexplained reproductive failure.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWolbachia pipientis is an endosymbiont bacteria that induce cytoplasmic incompatibility and inhibit arboviral replication in mosquitoes. This study aimed at estimating the prevalence and genetic diversity of Wolbachia in different mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) species from Cape Verde.\n\nMethodsMosquitoes were collected in six islands of Cape Verde using dippers/pipettes, BG-sentinel(R) traps, CDC light traps, and dorsal aspirators. Samples were identified to species using morphological keys and PCR-based molecular assays. Wolbachia was detected by amplifying a fragment of the surface protein gene (wsp). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed with five housekeeping genes (coxA, gatB, ftsZ, hcpA and fbpA) and the wsp hypervariable region (HVR) for strain identification. Identification of wPip groups (wPip-I to wPip-V) was performed using PCR-RFLP assay on the ankyrin-domain gene pk1.\n\nResultsNine mosquito species were collected, including the major vectors Aedes aegypti, Anopheles arabiensis, Culex pipiens s.s. and Culex quinquefasciatus. Wolbachia was detected in Cx. pipiens s.s. (100% prevalence), Cx. quinquefasciatus (98.3%), Cx. pipiens/quinquefasciatus hybrids (100%) and Culex tigripes (100%). Results from MLST and wsp hypervariable region typing showed that Wolbachia from Cx. pipiens s.l. belong to Sequence Type 9, wPip clade and supergroup B Wolbachia. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that Wolbachia isolated from Cx. tigripes belongs to Supergroup B but integrates a distinct clade from wPip with no attributed MLST profile. PCR-RFLP revealed wPip-II, wPip-III and wPip-IV groups in Culex pipiens s.l. wPip-IV was the dominant group, while wPip-II and wPip-III were restricted to Maio and Fogo islands, respectively.\n\nConclusionOur study showed a high prevalence and diversity of Wolbachia in Cx pipiens s.l. from Cape Verde islands and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to detect Wolbachia in Cx. tigripes, being represented in this species by a previously undescribed MLST Sequence Type.",

    "abstract": "Human corneal endothelial cells are organized in a tight mosaic of hexagonal cells and serve a critical function in maintaining corneal hydration and clear vision. Regeneration of the corneal endothelial tissue is hampered by its poor proliferative capacity, which is partially retrieved in vitro, albeit only for a limited number of passages before the cells undergo mesenchymal transition (EnMT). Although different culture conditions have been proposed in order to delay this process and prolong the number of cell passages, EnMT has still not been fully understood and successfully counteracted. In this perspective, we identified herein a single GSK3 inhibitor, CHIR99021, able to revert and avoid EnMT in primary human corneal endothelial cells (HCEnCs) from old donors until late passages in vitro (P8), as shown from cell morphology analysis (circularity). In accordance, CHIR99021 reduced expression of -SMA, an EnMT marker, while restored endothelial markers such as ZO-1, Na+/K+ ATPase and N-cadherin, without increasing cell proliferation. A further analysis on RNA expression confirmed CHIR99021 induced downregulation of EnMT markers (SMA and CD44), upregulation of the proliferation repressor p21 and revealed novel insights into the {beta}-catenin and TGF{beta} pathways intersections in HCEnCs. The use of CHIR99021 sheds light on the mechanisms involved in EnMT and brings a substantial advantage in maintaining primary HCEnCs in culture until late passages, while preserving the correct morphology and phenotype. Altogether, these results bring crucial advancements towards the improvement of the corneal endothelial cells based therapy.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is increasingly being appreciated as a master regulator of animal health. However, most avian gut microbiome studies have focused on birds of economic importance while the gut microbiomes of raptors remain underexplored. Here we examine the gut microbiota of 29 samples from four Falco species including hybrid birds-- raptors of historic importance --in the context of avian evolution by sequencing the 16S rDNA V4 region. Our results reveal that evolutionary histories and diet are significantly associated with avian gut microbiota in general, whereas diet plays a major role in shaping the falcon gut microbiota. Multiple analyses revealed that gut microbial diversity, composition, and abundance of key diet-discriminating bacterial genera in the falcon gut closely resemble those of carnivorous raptors rather than those of their closest phylogenetic relatives. Furthermore, the falcon microbiota is dominated by Firmicutes and consists of Salmonella at appreciable levels. Salmonella presence may potentially alter the functional capacity of the falcon gut microbiota as its abundance is associated with depletion of multiple predicted metabolic pathways involved in protein mass buildup, muscle maintenance, and enrichment of antimicrobial compound degradation, thus increasing the pathogenic potential of the falcon gut and presents a potential risk to human health.\n\nAuthor Summary in Arabic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517295v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1440126org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a76b91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@870bccorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17ac82_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Poultry, mainly chickens and its white meat represents one of the main, nutritionally valuable, and affordable red meat replacer source of protein throughout the whole world with special reference to developing countries. A long list of microbial agents especially bacterial pathogens threat chickens production cycles. They constitute one of the major problems facing the rapidly expanding poultry industry and are responsible for considerable economic losses.). Fowl Cholera, Infectious Coryza, and Ornithobacterium Rhinotracheale (ORT) diseases were among the serious bacterial infections that affect respiratory tract of chickens with an global adverse effect on poultry production. A formalized whole culture vaccine of composed of P. multocida serotypes A5, A8, A9 and D2, Avibacterium paragallinarum serotype A and C and Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale serotype A was prepared. This polyvalent vaccine proved to be safe producing no adverse side effects when injected in chickens. The immunizing efficacy of this vaccine was evaluated in SPF chickens, which were immunized at 6 weeks of age. The protective efficacy of the vaccine was determined using challenge test. The developed vaccine was effective in protecting chickens against Fowl Cholera, Infectious Coryza and Ornithobacterium Infection (ORT diseases) in chickens against challenge with these pathogens. Vaccinated chickens challenged with virulent Pasteurella Multocida serotypes A5, A8, A9 and D2 showed protection rates of 86.6%, 93.3%, 93.3% and 93.3%, respectively, as compared with 100% mortality in the non-vaccinated control. Vaccinated chickens challenged with Avibacterium paragallinarum serotypes A and C showed protection rates of 86.6% and 93.3%, respectively. Also, the protection rate against challenge with virulent Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale serotype A reached to 96.6%.",
