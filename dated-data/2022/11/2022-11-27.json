    "abstract": "Sensory receptive fields are large enough that they can contain more than one perceptible stimulus. How, then, can the brain encode information about each of the stimuli that may be present at a given moment? We recently showed that when more than one stimulus is present, single neurons can fluctuate between coding one vs. the other(s) across some time period, suggesting a form of neural multiplexing of different stimuli (Caruso et al., 2018). Here we investigate (a) whether such coding fluctuations occur in early visual cortical areas; (b) how coding fluctuations are coordinated across the neural population; and (c) how coordinated coding fluctuations depend on the parsing of stimuli into separate vs. fused objects. We found coding fluctuations do occur in macaque V1 but only when the two stimuli form separate objects. Such separate objects evoked a novel pattern of V1 spike count (\"noise\") correlations involving distinct distributions of positive and negative values. This bimodal correlation pattern was most pronounced among pairs of neurons showing the strongest evidence for coding fluctuations or multiplexing. Whether a given pair of neurons exhibited positive or negative correlations depended on whether the two neurons both responded better to the same object or had different object preferences. Distinct distributions of spike count correlations based on stimulus preferences were also seen in V4 for separate objects but not when two stimuli fused to form one object. These findings suggest multiple objects evoke different response dynamics than those evoked by single stimuli, lending support to the multiplexing hypothesis and suggesting a means by which information about multiple objects can be preserved despite the apparent coarseness of sensory coding.\n\nSignificance StatementHow the brain separates information about multiple objects despite overlap in the neurons responsive to each item is not well understood. Here we show that some neurons in V1 exhibit coding fluctuations in response to two objects, and that these coding fluctuations are coordinated at the population level in ways that are not observed for single objects. Broadly similar results were obtained in V4. These response dynamics lend support to the hypothesis that information about individual objects may be multiplexed across the neural population, preserving information about each item despite the coarseness of sensory coding.",

    "abstract": "Cell segmentation is a cornerstone of many bioimage informatics studies and inaccurate segmentation introduces error in downstream analysis. Evaluating segmentation results is thus a necessary step for developing segmentation methods as well as for choosing the most appropriate method for a particular type of sample. The evaluation process has typically involved comparison of segmentations to those generated by humans, which can be expensive and subject to unknown bias. We present here an approach to evaluating cell segmentation methods without relying upon comparison to results from humans. For this, we defined a number of segmentation quality metrics that can be applied to multichannel fluorescence images. We calculated these metrics for 14 previously-described segmentation methods applied to datasets from 4 multiplexed microscope modalities covering 5 tissues. Using principal component analysis to combine the metrics we defined an overall cell segmentation quality score and ranked the segmentation methods. We found that two deep learning-based methods performed the best overall, but that results for all methods could be significantly improved by postprocessing to ensure proper matching of cell and nuclear masks. Our evaluation tool is available as open source and all code and data are available in a Reproducible Research Archive.",

    "abstract": "Movement-correlated brain activity has been found across species and brain regions. Here, we used fast whole-brain lightfield imaging in adult Drosophila to investigate the relationship between walk and neuronal activity. We observed brainwide activity that tightly correlated with spontaneous bouts of walk. While imaging specific sets of excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory neurons highlighted their joint contribution, spatial heterogeneity in forward walk- and turning-induced activity allowed parsing unique responses from subregions and sometimes individual neurons. For example, previously uncharacterized serotonergic neurons were inhibited during walk. While activity onset in some areas preceded walk onset exclusively in spontaneously walking animals, spontaneous and forced walk elicited highly similar activity in most brain regions. These data suggest a major contribution of walk and walk-related sensory or proprioceptive information to brain state. We conclude that walk-related signals induce global but heterogeneous patterns of activity, allowing for local and brain-wide integration of behavioral state into other processes in the brain.",

    "abstract": "How do attention and consciousness interact in the human brain? Rival theories of consciousness disagree on the role of fronto-parietal attentional networks in conscious perception. We recorded neural activity from 727 intracerebral contacts in 13 epileptic patients, while they detected near-threshold targets preceded by attentional cues. Unsupervised clustering revealed three patterns: (1) Attention-enhanced conscious report accompanied sustained right-hemisphere fronto-temporal activity, in networks connected by the superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) II-III, and late accumulation in bilateral dorso-prefrontal and right-hemisphere orbitofrontal cortex (SLF I-III). (2) Attentional reorienting affected conscious report through early, sustained activity in a right-hemisphere network (SLF III). (3) Conscious report accompanied left-hemisphere dorsolateral-prefrontal activity. Task modeling with recurrent neural networks identified specific excitatory and inhibitory interactions between attention and consciousness, and their causal contribution to conscious perception of near-threshold targets. Thus, distinct, hemisphere-asymmetric fronto-parietal networks support attentional gain and reorienting in shaping human conscious experience.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryIntracerebral recordings, tractography and modeling reveal the interaction of attention and consciousness in the human brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrediction of post-stroke outcome using the degree of subacute deficit or magnetic resonance imaging is well studied in humans. While mice are frequently used animals in preclinical stroke research, systematic analysis of outcome predictors is lacking.\n\nMethodsWe introduced heterogeneity into our study to broaden the applicability of our prediction tools. We analyzed the effect of 30, 45 and 60 minutes of arterial occlusion on the variance of stroke volumes. Next, we built a heterogeneous cohort of 215 mice using data from 15 studies that included 45 minutes of middle cerebral artery occlusion and various genotypes. Motor function was measured using the staircase test of skilled reaching. Phases of subacute and residual deficit were defined. Magnetic resonance images of stroke lesions were co-registered on the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas to characterize stroke topology. Different random forest prediction models that either used motor-functional deficit or imaging parameters were generated for the subacute and residual deficits.\n\nResultsVariance of stroke volumes was increased by 45 minutes of arterial occlusion compared to 60 minutes and including various genotypes. We detected both a subacute and residual motor-functional deficit after stroke and different recovery trajectories. In mice with small cortical lesions, lesion volume was the best predictor of the subacute deficit. The residual deficit was most accurately predicted by the degree of the subacute deficit. When using imaging parameters for the prediction of the residual deficit, including information about the lesion topology increased prediction accuracy. A subset of anatomical regions within the ischemic lesion had particular impact on the prediction of long-term outcome.\n\nConclusionsWe developed and validated a robust tool for the prediction of functional outcome after stroke in mice using a large heterogeneous cohort. Study design and imaging limitations are discussed. In the future, using outcome prediction can improve the design of preclinical studies and guide intervention decisions.",

Neoclassical economics provides a formalism for optimal decisions, but the apparatus requires a large number of evaluations of the decision options as well as representations and computations that are biologically implausible. This article shows that natural constraints distill the economic optimization into an efficient and biologically plausible decision strategy. In this strategy, decision-makers evaluate the relative reward across their options and allocate their effort proportionally, thus equalizing the reward per effort across their options. Using a combination of analytical and simulation approaches, the article shows that this strategy is efficient, providing optimal or near-optimal gain following a single evaluation of decision options. The strategy is also rational; satisficing and indifferent decision-makers are found to perform relatively poorly. Moreover, the relativistic value functions underlying this efficient strategy provide an account of time discounting, effort discounting, and resource discounting in general.",

    "abstract": "During visual search, it is important to reduce the interference of distracting objects in the scene. The neuronal responses elicited by the search target stimulus are typically enhanced. However, it is equally important to suppress the representations of distracting stimuli, especially if they are salient and capture attention. We trained monkeys to make an eye movement to a unique  pop-out shape stimulus among an array of distracting stimuli. One of these distractors had a salient color that varied across trials and differed from the color of the other stimuli, causing it to also pop-out. The monkeys were able to select the pop-out shape target with high accuracy and actively avoided the pop-out color distractor. This behavioral pattern was reflected in the activity of neurons in area V4. Responses to the shape targets were enhanced, while the activity evoked by the pop-out color distractor was only briefly enhanced, directly followed by a sustained period of pronounced suppression. These behavioral and neuronal results demonstrate a cortical selection mechanism that rapidly inverts a pop-out signal to  pop-in for an entire feature dimension thereby facilitating goal-directed visual search in the presence of salient distractors.\n\nSignificance statementGoal-directed behaviors like visual search involve both the selection of behaviorally relevant targets and the suppression of task-irrelevant distractors. This is especially important if distractors are salient and capture attention. Here we demonstrate that non-human primates suppress a salient color distractor while searching for a target that is defined by shape, i.e. another feature dimension. The neuronal activity of V4 neurons revealed the temporal evolution of target selection and distractor suppression. The neuronal responses elicited by the pop-out target stimuli were enhanced whereas responses elicited by salient pop-out color distractors were suppressed, after an initial brief phase of response enhancement. Our results reveal a  pop-in mechanism by which the visual cortex inverts an attentional capture signal into suppression to facilitate visual search.",

    "abstract": "The ability of synapses to maintain physiological levels of evoked neurotransmission is essential for neuronal stability. A variety of perturbations can disrupt neurotransmission, but synapses often compensate for disruptions and work to stabilize activity levels, using forms of homeostatic synaptic plasticity. Presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP) is one such mechanism. PHP is expressed at the Drosophila melanogaster larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapse, as well as other NMJs. In PHP, presynaptic neurotransmitter release increases to offset the effects of impairing muscle transmitter receptors. Prior Drosophila work has studied PHP using different ways to perturb muscle receptor function - either acutely (using pharmacology) or chronically (using genetics). Some of our prior data suggested that cytoplasmic calcium signaling was important for expression of PHP after genetic impairment of glutamate receptors. Here we followed up on that observation. We used a combination of transgenic Drosophila RNA interference and overexpression lines, along with NMJ electrophysiology, synapse imaging, and pharmacology to test if regulators of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase calcineurin are necessary for the normal expression of PHP. We found that either pre- or postsynaptic dysregulation of a Drosophila gene regulating calcineurin, sarah (sra), blocks PHP. Tissue-specific manipulations showed that either increases or decreases in sra expression are detrimental to PHP. Additionally, pharmacologically and genetically induced forms of expression of PHP are functionally separable depending entirely upon which sra genetic manipulation is used. Surprisingly, dual-tissue pre- and postsynaptic sra knockdown or overexpression can ameliorate PHP blocks revealed in single-tissue experiments. Pharmacological and genetic inhibition of calcineurin corroborated this latter finding. Our results suggest tight calcineurin regulation is needed across multiple tissue types to stabilize peripheral synaptic outputs.",

Otherwise, it becomes extinct. Taxon cycles have been defined mostly for tropical island faunas, examples from continental areas are scarce and similar case studies for plants remain unknown. Most taxon cycles have been identified on the basis of phylogeographic studies, and straightforward empirical evidence from fossils is lacking. Here, empirical fossil evidence is provided for recurrent Eocene to present expansion/contraction cycles in a mangrove taxon (Pelliciera), after a Neotropical-wide study of the available pollen records. This recurrent behavior is compatible with the concept of taxon cycle from biogeographical, chronological and ecological perspectives. The biotic and abiotic drivers potentially involved in the initiation and maintenance of the Pelliciera expansion/contraction cycles are analyzed, and the ecological and evolutionary implications are discussed. Whether this could be a trend toward extinction is considered under the predictions of the taxon cycle theory. The recurrent expansion and contraction cycles identified for Pelliciera have strong potential for being the first empirically and unequivocally documented taxon cycles and likely the only taxon cycles documented to date for plants.",

    "abstract": "Dynamic systems such as cells or tissues generate, either spontaneously or in response to stimuli, transient signals that carry information about the system. Characterization of recorded transients is often hampered by a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Reduction of the noise by filtering has limited use due to partial signal distortion. Occasionally, transients can be approximated by a mathematical function, but such a function may not hold correctly if recording conditions change. We introduce here the model-independent approximation method for general noisy transient signals based on the Gaussian process regression (GPR). The method was implemented in the software TransientAnalyzer, which detects transients in a record, finds their best approximation by the Gaussian process, constructs a surrogate spline function, and estimates specified signal parameters. The method and software were tested on a cellular model of the calcium concentration transient corrupted by various SNR levels and recorded at a low sampling frequency. Statistical analysis of the model data sets provided the error of estimation <7.5% and the coefficient of variation of estimates <17% for peak SNR=5. The performance of GPR on signals of diverse experimental origin was even better than fitting by a function. The software and its description are available on GitHub.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTransient signals convey information on the state and function of the studied system. However, the estimation of their characteristic parameters is complicated by the noise present in the recordings. Methods used for noise reduction have various disadvantages, such as distortion of the time course by filtering, the difficult superposition of many transients for accurate averaging, or a lack of a model for data fitting. In this work, we present a general method for the automatic analysis of noisy transient signals based on Gaussian process regression and its implementation in Python. The method can analyze recorded transients reliably at peak SNR [&ge;] 2 with a precision equivalent to the model-fitting methods.",

However, only 50% of ACPA-positive at-risk individuals will progress to a clinical RA diagnosis. This observation suggests that there are different types of ACPA and that their relationship with RA development is more complex than presently assumed.\n\nTo address the biological effect of ACPA in the establishment and development of inflammatory arthritis, we made use of the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model of passive arthritis. Using seven unique patient derived monoclonal ACPA, we observed that ACPA are predominantly anti-inflammatory, with some clones (C03 and BVCA1) completely inhibiting disease development. We have also identified a clone (C04) as having a disease-prone effect, by increasing and sustaining disease prevalence. This clone had previously been reported as being pro-inflammatory in a different model of joint inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects of C03 were dependent on Fc{gamma}R, since neither F(ab)2 or a mutated Fc-null GRLR-C03 clone could mediate disease protection. Most importantly, mice receiving polyclonal ACPA enriched from RA sera were also partially protected from disease. Looking at the cell and tissue of origin of the ACPA clones, their V(D)J sequences, Fc glycosylation pattern and fine-specificities, we could not identify a common feature between anti-inflammatory ACPA distinguishing them from those without the properties. Together, our data demonstrates that circulating ACPA in RA patients are predominantly anti-inflammatory, emphasizing the need to study ACPA repertoires in order to determine their influence on the clinical outcome of the patient or at-risk individual.",

    "abstract": "T cells are required to clear infection, moving first in lymph nodes to interact with antigen bearing dendritic cells leading to activation. T cells then move to sites of infection to find and clear infection. T cell motion plays a role in how quickly a T cell finds its target, from initial naive T cell activation by a dendritic cell to interaction with target cells in infected tissue. To better understand how different tissue environments might affect T cell motility, we compared multiple features of T cell motion including speed, persistence, turning angle, directionality, and confinement of motion from T cells moving in multiple tissues using tracks collected with microscopy from murine tissues. We quantitatively analyzed naive T cell motility within the lymph node and compared motility parameters with activated CD8 T cells moving within the villi of small intestine and lung under different activation conditions.\n\nOur motility analysis found that while the speeds and the overall displacement of T cells vary within all tissues analyzed, T cells in all tissues tended to persist at the same speed, particularly if the previous speed is very slow (less than 2 {micro}m/min) or very fast (greater than 8 {micro}m/min) with the exception of T cells in the villi for speeds greater than 10 {micro}m/min. Interestingly, we found that turning angles of T cells in the lung show a marked population of T cells turning at close to 180o, while T cells in lymph nodes and villi do not exhibit this \"reversing\" movement. Additionally, T cells in the lung showed significantly decreased meandering ratios and increased confinement compared to T cells in lymph nodes and villi. The combination of these differences in motility patterns led to a decrease in the total volume scanned by T cells in lung compared to T cells in lymph node and villi. These results suggest that the tissue environment in which T cells move can impact the type of motility and ultimately, the efficiency of T cell search for target cells within specialized tissues such as the lung.",

    "abstract": "The human GPCR family comprises circa 800 members, activated by hundreds of thousands of compounds. Bitter taste receptors, TAS2Rs, constitute a large and distinct subfamily, expressed orally and extra-orally and involved in physiological and pathological conditions. TAS2R14 is the most promiscuous member, with over 150 agonists and 3 antagonists known prior to this study. Due to the scarcity of inhibitors and to the importance of chemical probes for exploring TAS2R14 functions, we aimed to discover new ligands for this receptor, with emphasis on antagonists. To cope with the lack of experimental structure of the receptor, we used a mixed experimental/computational methodology which iteratively improved the performance of the predicted structure. The increasing number of active compounds, obtained here through experimental screening of FDA-approved drug library, and of chemically synthesized flufenamic acid derivatives, enabled the refinement of the binding pocket, which in turn improved the structure-based virtual screening reliability. This mixed approach led to the identification of 10 new antagonists and 200 new agonists of TAS2R14, illustrating the untapped potential of rigorous medicinal chemistry for TAS2Rs. The iterative framework suggested residues involved in the activation process, is suitable for expanding bitter and bitter-masking chemical space, and is applicable to other promiscuous GPCRs lacking experimental structures.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=172 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517821v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@30bd42org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d94fbforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2858borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d9af2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "After fertilization, zygotic genome activation (ZGA) marks the beginning of the embryonic program for a totipotent embryo, which further gives rise to the pluripotent embryonic lineages and extraembryonic trophectoderm after the first lineage commitment. While much has been learned about pluripotency regulation, how ZGA is connected to the pluripotency commitment in early embryos remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of nuclear receptor 1 family transcription factors (TFs) in mouse pre-implantation embryos, whose motifs are highly enriched in accessible chromatin at the 2-cell (2C) to 8-cell (8C) stages after ZGA. We found NR5A2, an NR TF highly induced upon ZGA, is required for early development, as both the knockdown and knockout of Nr5a2 from 1C embryos led to morula arrest. While the zygotic genome was largely activated at the 2C stage, 4-8C-specific gene activation (mid-preimplantation activation) was substantially impaired. Genome-wide chromatin binding and RNA-seq analyses showed NR5A2 preferentially regulates its binding targets including a subset of key pluripotency genes (i.e., Nanog, Pou5f1, and Tdgf1). Finally, NR5A2-occupied sites at the 2C and 8C stages predominantly reside in accessible B1 elements where its motif is embedded. Taken together, these data identify NR5A2 as a key regulator that connects ZGA to the first lineage segregation in early mouse development.",

BRs inactivate BIN2, but how they govern stomatal development remains unclear. Mapping the single-cell transcriptome of stomatal lineages with either exogenous BRs or the specific BIN2 inhibitor revealed that the two modes of BR activation triggered spatiotemporally distinct transcriptional responses. We established that when in a complex with POLAR and its closest homolog POLAR-LIKE1, BIN2 is insulated from BR-mediated inactivation, nevertheless, it remains sensitive to the inhibitor. Subsequently, BR signalling is attenuated in ACD precursors, whereas it remains active in epidermal cells that would undergo differentiation.

Early macrophage rich vascular inflammation is a key feature in the pathophysiology of restenosis after angioplasty. 19F MRI with intravenously applied perfluorooctyl bromide-nanoemulsion (PFOB-NE) could offer ideal features for serial imaging of the inflammatory response after angioplasty. In eight minipigs, injury of the right carotid artery was induced by either balloon oversize angioplasty only (BA, n=4) or in combination with endothelial denudation (BA + ECDN, n=4). PFOB-NE was administered intravenously three days after injury followed by 1H and 19F MRI to assess vascular inflammatory burden at day six. Vascular response to mechanical injury was validated using immunohistology. Angioplasty was successfully induced in all eight pigs. Response to injury was characterized by positive remodeling with predominantly adventitial wall thickening and adventitial infiltration of monocytes/macrophages. 19F signal could be detected in vivo in four pigs following BA + ECDN with a robust signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 14.7 {+/-} 4.8. Ex vivo analysis revealed a linear correlation of 19F SNR to local monocyte/macrophage cell density. Minimum detection limit of infiltrated monocytes/macrophages was as about 400 cells/mm2. Therefore, 19F MRI enables quantification of monocyte/macrophage infiltration after vascular injury with sufficient sensitivity.

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) have the potential function in regulating gene expression. Transcription factor TFAP2C plays important roles in the regulation of post-implantation embryonic development in mice, the reprogramming process, trophectoderm formation and carcinogenesis, but its role in porcine early embryo development remains unclear. This study was conducted to investigate the role of TFAP2C in porcine early embryo development using siRNA cytoplasmic injection. The RNAseq and immunofluorescence staining were performed to detect gene expression, and ChIP and dual luciferase reporter assays were used to elucidate the mechanism. The results showed that the deficiency of TFAP2C could lead to embryonic development disorder. The percentage of the blastocyst in the TFAP2C knockdown (TFAP2C-KD) group (7.76{+/-}1.86%) was significantly decreased compared to the control group (22.92{+/-}1.97%) (P**<0.01). The RNAseq results showed that 1208 genes were downregulated and 792 genes were upregulated after siRNA injection. The expression of epigenetic modification enzymes KDM5B, SETD2 (P**<0.01) etc. were significantly elevated in TFAP2C-KD group. Meanwhile, the modification levels of H3K4me3, H3K4me2 and H3K9me3 (P*<0.05) were significantly decreased, and the modification levels of H3K36me3 (P**<0.01) and DNA methylation (P**<0.01) were significantly increased in TFAP2C-KD group. DNMT1 was mostly expressed in cytoplasm in the control group, while it was mainly expressed in nuclei in the TFAP2C-KD group. In addition, TFAP2C could bind to the promoter region of SETD2, and the mutation of the TFAP2C binding site resulted in increased activity of SETD2 promoter (P**<0.01). The knockdown of TFAP2C affects histone modification and DNA methylation by regulating the expression of SETD2, KDM5B etc. and other genes, thereby inhibiting embryonic development. TFAP2C binds to the promoter region of SETD2 and acts as a hindrance protein. This study fills in the deficiency of TFAP2C in porcine early embryo development and provides theoretical support for animal husbandry production and biomedicine.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe correct activation of embryonic genes is required during early embryonic development, and the activation of these genes is subject to strict epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, histone acetylation and methylation, with abnormalities in either leading to birth defects and developmental defects in individuals. TFs have specific binding motifs that regulate gene expression by binding to them. TFAP2C has been studied in post-implantation embryonic development and trophectoderm generation, however, the effect on early embryo development is unknown. Our findings suggest that TFAP2C deficiency disrupts gene expression patterns and leads to abnormal epigenetic modifications, resulting in abnormal embryo development. Furthermore, we found for the first time that TFAP2C can bind to the promoter region of SETD2, thereby affecting early embryo development in pigs. This indicates the critical role of TFAP2C in early embryo development in pigs on one hand, and also provides theoretical support for livestock production and biomedicine.",

However, its optimal integration in clone breeding programs that up to now relied on phenotypic selection (PS) requires further research. The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate under a fixed budget how the weight of GS relative to PS, the stage of implementing GS, the correlation between an auxiliary trait assessed in early generations and the target trait, the variance components, and the prediction accuracy affect the genetic gain of the target trait of GS compared to PS, (ii) determine the optimal allocation of resources maximizing the genetic gain of the target trait in each selection strategy and for varying cost scenarios, and (iii) make recommendations to breeders how to implement GS in clone and especially potato breeding programs. In our simulation results, any selection strategy involving GS had a higher short-term genetic gain for the target trait than Standard-PS. In addition, we show that implementing GS in consecutive selection stages can largely enhance short-term genetic gain and recommend the breeders to implement GS at single hills and A clone stages. Furthermore, we observed for selection strategies involving GS that the optimal allocation of resources maximizing the genetic gain of the target trait differed considerably from those typically used in potato breeding programs. Therefore, our study provides new insight for breeders regarding how to optimally implement GS in a commercial potato breeding program to improve the short-term genetic gain for their target trait.",

    "abstract": "Conservation genomic studies in non-model organisms generally rely on genome reduction techniques based on restriction enzymes to identify population structure as well as candidate loci for local adaptation. These reduced libraries ensure a high density of SNP loci and high coverage for accurate genotyping. Despite the fraction of the genome that is sequenced is expected to be randomly located, the reduction of the genome might depend on the recognition site of the restriction enzyme used. Here, we evaluate the distribution and functional composition of loci obtained after Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) genome reduction with two widely used restriction enzymes (EcoT22I and ApeKI). To do so, we compared data from two endemic fish species (Symphodus ocellatus and Symphodus tinca, EcoT22I enzyme) and two ecosystem engineer sea urchins (Paracentrotus lividus and Arbacia lixula, ApeKI enzyme). In brief, we mapped the sequenced loci to the phylogenetically closest reference genome available (Labrus bergylta for fish and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus for sea urchins), classified them as exonic, intronic, and intergenic, and studied their functionality by using GO terms. We detected an enrichment towards exonic or intergenic regions depending on the restriction enzyme used, and we did not detect differences between total loci and candidate loci for adaptation. Despite most GO terms being shared between species, the analysis of their abundance showed differences between taxonomic groups, which may be attributed to differences of the targeted loci. Our results highlight the importance of restriction enzyme selection and the need for high-quality annotated genomes in conservation genomic studies.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic reintroduction can supplement natural recolonisation in reestablishing a species distribution and abundance. However, both reintroductions and recolonisations can give rise to population bottlenecks that reduce genetic diversity and increase inbreeding, potentially causing accumulation of genetic load and reduced fitness. Most current populations of the endemic high-arctic Svalbard reindeer (Rangifer tarandus platyrhynchus) originate from recent reintroductions or recolonisations following regional extirpations due to past overharvesting. We investigated and compared the genomic consequences of these two paths to reestablishment using whole-genome shotgun sequencing of 100 Svalbard reindeer across their range. We found little admixture between reintroduced and natural populations. Two reintroduced populations, each founded by 12 individuals around four decades (i.e. 8 reindeer generations) ago, formed two distinct genetic clusters. Compared to the source population, these populations showed only small decreases in genome-wide heterozygosity and increases in inbreeding and lengths of runs of homozygosity. In contrast, the two naturally recolonised populations without admixture possessed much lower heterozygosity, higher inbreeding, and longer runs of homozygosity, possibly caused by serial population bottlenecks and/or fewer or more genetically related founders than in the reintroduction events. Naturally recolonised populations can thus be more vulnerable to the accumulation of genetic load than reintroduced populations. This suggests that in some organisms even small-scale reintroduction programs based on genetically diverse source populations can be more effective than natural recolonisation in establishing genetically diverse populations. These findings warrant particular attention in the conservation and management of populations and species threatened by habitat fragmentation and loss.",

    "abstract": "The neurotensin receptor 1 (NTS1) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) with promise as a drug target for the treatment of pain, schizophrenia, obesity, addiction, and various cancers. A detailed picture of the NTS1 structural landscape has been established by X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM and yet, the molecular determinants for why a receptor couples to G protein versus arrestin transducers remain poorly defined. We used 13C{varepsilon}H3-methionine NMR spectroscopy to show that phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) promotes transducer complexation not by dramatically altering the receptor structure but by strengthening long-range allosteric connections, in the form of correlated conformational kinetics, between the orthosteric pocket and highly-conserved activation motifs. {beta}-arrestin-1 further remodels the receptor ensemble by reducing conformational exchange kinetics for a subset of resonances, whereas G protein coupling has little to no effect on the rate. A {beta}-arrestin biased allosteric modulator transforms the NTS1:G protein complex into a concatenation of substates, without triggering transducer dissociation, suggesting that it may function by stabilizing signaling incompetent G protein conformations such as the non-canonical state. Together, our work demonstrates the importance of kinetic information to a complete picture of the GPCR activation landscape.",

    "abstract": "Insufficient insulin secretion to meet metabolic demand results in diabetes. The intracellular flux of Ca2+ into {beta}-cells triggers insulin release. Since genetics strongly influences variation in islet secretory responses, we surveyed islet Ca2+ dynamics in eight genetically diverse mouse strains. We found high strain variation in response to four conditions: 1) 8 mM glucose; 2) 8 mM glucose plus amino acids; 3) 8 mM glucose, amino acids, plus 10 nM GIP; and 4) 2 mM glucose. These stimuli interrogate {beta}-cell function, -cell to {beta}-cell signaling, and incretin responses. We then correlated components of the Ca2+ waveforms to islet protein abundances in the same strains used for the Ca2+ measurements. To focus on proteins relevant to human islet function, we identified human orthologues of correlated mouse proteins that are proximal to glycemic-associated SNPs in human GWAS. Several orthologues have previously been shown to regulate insulin secretion (e.g. ABCC8, PCSK1, and GCK), supporting our mouse-to-human integration as a discovery platform. By integrating these data, we nominated novel regulators of islet Ca2+ oscillations and insulin secretion with potential relevance for human islet function.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCulture-independent 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding is a commonly used method in microbiome profiling. However, this approach can only reflect the proportion of sequencing reads, rather than the actual cell fraction. To achieve more quantitative cell fraction estimates, we need to resolve the 16S gene copy numbers (GCN) for different community members. Currently, there are several bioinformatic tools available to estimate 16S GCN, either based on taxonomy assignment or phylogeny.\n\nMethodHere we develop a novel algorithm, Stacked Ensemble Model (SEM), that estimates 16S GCN directly from the 16S rRNA gene sequence strings, without resolving taxonomy or phylogeny. For accessibility, we developed a public, end-to-end, web-based tool based on the SEM model, named Artificial Neural Network Approximator for 16S rRNA Gene Copy Number (ANNA16).\n\nResultsBased on 27,579 16S rRNA gene sequence data (rrnDB database), we show that ANNA16 outperforms the most commonly used 16S GCN prediction algorithms. The prediction error range in the 5-fold cross validation of SEM is completely lower than all other algorithms for the 16S full-length sequence and partially lower at 16S subregions. The final test and a mock community test indicate ANNA16 is more accurate than all currently available tools (i.e., rrnDB, CopyRighter, PICRUSt2, & PAPRICA). SHAP value analysis indicates ANNA16 mainly learns information from rare insertions.\n\nConclusionANNA16 represents a deep learning based 16S GCN prediction tool. Compared to the traditional GCN prediction tools, ANNA16 has a simple structure, faster inference speed without precomputing, and higher accuracy. With increased 16S GCN data in the database, future studies could improve the prediction errors for rare, high-GCN taxa due to current under sampling.",

    "abstract": "G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are ubiquitous integral membrane proteins involved in diverse cellular signaling processes and consequently serve as crucial drug targets. Here, we carry out the first large-scale ensemble thermodynamic study of 45 different ligand-free GPCRs employing a structure-based statistical mechanical framework and identify extensive conformational plasticity encompassing the seven transmembrane (TM) helices. Multiple partially structured states or intermediates co-exist in equilibrium in the native ensemble, with the TM helices 1, 6 and 7 displaying varied degrees of structure, and TM3 exhibiting the maximal stability. Active state GPCRs are characterized by reduced conformational heterogeneity with altered coupling-patterns distributed not just locally but throughout the structural scaffold. Strongly coupled residues are distributed across the structure in an anisotropic manner accounting for only 13% of the residues, highlighting that a large number of residues in GPCRs are inherently dynamic to enable structural motions critical for function. Our work thus uncovers the thermodynamic hallmarks of GPCR structure and activation, and how differences quantifiable only via higher-order coupling free energies provide insights into their exquisite structural specialization and the fluid nature of the intramolecular interaction network. The intricate landscapes and perturbation methodologies presented here lay the foundation for understanding allosteric mechanisms in GPCRs, location of structural-functional hot-spots, and effects of disease-causing mutations.",

    "abstract": "In plants, developmental plasticity allows for the modulation of organ growth in response to environmental cues. Being in contact with soil, roots are the first organ responding to soil abiotic stresses such as high salt concentration. In the root, plasticity relies on changes in the activity of the apical meristem, the region at the tip of the root where a set of self-renewing undifferentiated stem cells sustains growth. We show that salt stress promotes root meristem cells differentiation via reducing the dosage of the microRNAs miR165 and 166. By means of genetic, molecular and computational analysis, we show that the levels of miR165 and 166 respond to high salt concentration, and that miR165 and 166-dependent PHB modulation is fundamental for the response of root growth to this stress. Salt dependent reductions of miR165 and 166 causes rapid increase of the Arabidopsis homeobox protein PHABULOSA (PHB) expression and production of the root meristem pro-differentiation hormone cytokinin. Our data provide direct evidence of how the miRNA-dependent modulation of transcription factors dosage mediates plastic development in plants.\n\nIn plants, development must be both robust - to ensure appropriate growth - and plastic - to enable the adaptation to external cues. Plastic development largely depends on the modulation of gene expression, controlling the concentration of developmental factors, such as hormones, transcription factors (TFs) and signalling molecules (Garcia-Molina et al, 2013; Hofhuis & Heidstra, 2018; Lopez-Ruiz et al, 2020; Schroder et al, 2021). A classic example of plant developmental plasticity is the adaptation of plant growth to high salt conditions, a stress that inhibits shoot and root development (Flowers et al, 1997). Roots are the first organs sensing salt concentration in soil, where high salt reduces meristem activity and root growth (Dinneny et al, 2008; Geng et al, 2013; Jiang et al, 2016). It has been suggested that the regulation of several plant hormones and miRNAs mediate the plant response to salt stress (Dolata et al, 2016; Geng et al, 2013; Iglesias et al, 2014; Jiang et al, 2016; Nishiyama et al, 2011; Yan et al, 2016). However, the molecular interplays mediating the adaptation of plant roots to salt stress are still vague. Post-embryonic root growth is supported by the activity of the root meristem, a region located at the root tip where self-renewing stem cells divide asymmetrically in the stem cell niche (SCN), originating transit-amplifying daughter cells that divide in the division zone (DZ) (Di Mambro et al, 2018). Once these cells reach a developmental boundary denominated transition zone (TZ), they stop dividing and start to elongate in the so-called elongation/differentiation zone (EDZ) (Di Mambro et al, 2018). A dynamic balance between cell division and cell differentiation ensures continuous root growth, maintaining a fixed number of cells in the DZ. Alterations in this dynamic equilibrium promote or inhibit root growth (Di Mambro et al, 2018; Salvi et al, 2020). microRNA molecules (miRNA) play a key role in the control of root meristem development (Bertolotti et al, 2021a; Skopelitis et al, 2012). Maturation of plant miRNAs depends on the activity of a multiprotein complex comprising the DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1), HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) and SERRATE (SE) proteins that cut pre-miRNA transcripts into 21 nucleotides mature miRNA (Yan et al, 2016). Among miRNAs, miR165 and 166 have been shown to be main regulator of root development (Carlsbecker et al, 2010; Dello Ioio et al, 2012). miR165 and miR166 are pleiotropic regulators of plant developmental processes. miR165 and 166 family consists of nine independent loci (MIR165 A-B and MIR166 A-G) that drive expression of pre-miR165 and 166 in different tissues and at different developmental stages (Miyashima et al, 2011). miR165/166 activity is crucial in the control of robust development, restricting the expression of the HOMEODOMAIN LEUCINE ZIPPER III (HD-ZIPIII), including PHABULOSA (PHB) and PHAVOLUTA (PHV), which are involved in root and shoot development, vascular growth, and leaf and embryo polarity (Carlsbecker et al, 2010; Dello Ioio et al, 2012; Di Ruocco et al, 2017; Grigg et al, 2009; McConnell et al, 2001; Skopelitis et al, 2017; Williams et al, 2005). In the root, miR165/166 regulate meristem homeostasis and radial patterning (Carlsbecker et al, 2010; Dello Ioio et al, 2012); pre-miR165a, pre-miR166a and b transcription is promoted by the SCARECROW (SCR) and SHORTROOT (SHR) transcription factors (Carlsbecker et al, 2010) and, thanks to the cell-to-cell mobility, mature miR165 and 166 forms diffuse to patterns both the root vasculature and the ground tissue (Carlsbecker et al, 2010; Miyashima et al, 2011; Skopelitis et al, 2018; Vaten et al, 2011; Bertolotti et al, 2021b). In the root meristem the miR165-166-PHB module promotes the synthesis of the plant hormone cytokinin, an important player in root developmental plasticity regulating cell differentiation rate of meristematic cells via the activation of the ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE3 (AHK3)/ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 1/12 (ARR1/12) pathway (Dello Ioio et al, 2007,2008). Here, we show that in response to salt stress miR165 and 166 modulates PHB expression to adjust root meristem activity. Salt exposure results in changes in cytokinin biosynthesis, which further regulates the miR165/166-PHB module. Hence, in addition to the above-described miRNA activity in controlling root robust development, we provide clear evidence that, in response to environmental cues, miRNAs are crucial also in the control of root plastic development, modulating the dosage of transcription factors.",

    "abstract": "Waterlogging leads to major crop losses globally, particularly for waterlogging sensitive crops such as barley. Waterlogging reduces oxygen availability and results in additional stresses, leading to the activation of hypoxia and stress response pathways that promote plant survival. Although certain barley varieties have been shown to be more tolerant to waterlogging than others and some tolerance-related QTLs have been identified, the molecular mechanisms underlying this trait are mostly unknown. Transcriptomics approaches can provide very valuable information for our understanding of waterlogging tolerance. Here, we surveyed 21 barley varieties for the differential transcriptional activation of conserved hypoxia-response genes under waterlogging, and selected five varieties with different levels of induction of core hypoxia-response genes. We further characterized their phenotypic response to waterlogging in terms of shoot and root traits. RNA-sequencing to evaluate the genome-wide transcriptional responses to waterlogging of these selected varieties led to the identification of a set of 98 waterlogging-response genes common to the different datasets. Many of these genes are orthologs of the so-called  core hypoxia response genes, thus highlighting the conservation of plant responses to waterlogging. Hierarchical clustering analysis also identified groups of genes with intrinsic differential expression between varieties prior to waterlogging stress. These genes could constitute interesting candidates to study  predisposition to waterlogging tolerance or sensitivity in barley.",

Here we describe that the oxygen tensions sensed by T cells at the moment of activation act to persistently modulate both differentiation and function. We found that in a protocol of CAR-T cell generation, 24 hours of low oxygen levels during initial CD8+ T cell priming is sufficient to enhance antitumour cytotoxicity in a preclinical model. This is the case even when CAR-T cells are subsequently cultured under high oxygen tensions prior to adoptive transfer. Increased hypoxia inducible transcription factor (HIF) expression was able to alter T cell fate in a similar manner to exposure to low oxygen tensions; however, only a controlled or temporary increase in HIF signalling was able to consistently improve cytotoxic function of T cells. These data show that oxygenation levels during and immediately after T cell activation play an essential role in regulating T cell function.",

    "abstract": "Many traits are polygenic, affected by multiple genetic variants throughout the genome. Selection acting on these traits involves co-ordinated allele- frequency changes at these underlying variants, and this process has been extensively studied in random-mating populations. Yet many species self- fertilise to some degree, which incurs changes to genetic diversity, recombination and genome segregation. These factors cumulatively influence how polygenic selection is realised in nature. Here, we use simulations to investigate to what extent self-fertilisation affects polygenic adaptation to a new environment. We find that self-fertilisation can incur a fitness advantage through purging maladaptive genotypes. While the degree of self- fertilisation has little influence on how quickly a population adapts to a new optimum, those with the highest long-term fitness tended to have high levels of selfing (at least 90%). Very high levels of self-fertilisation (99% and above) causes fixation of variants with compensatory effects in elevated linkage disequilibrium across the genome. Conversely, if mutations are pleiotropic then only a few major-effect variants fix along with many neutral hitchhikers, with a transient increase in linkage disequilibrium. If deleterious mutations are also present then linkage-block formation is disrupted in highly-selfing species, with fewer mutations contributing to adaptation and less chance of high-linkage genomes persisting over time. We also show how these outcomes differ in outcrossing populations with rescaled mutation and recombination rates, demonstrating that elevated homozygosity also influences the selection response. These results show potential advantages to self-fertilisation when adapting to a new environment, and how the mating system affects the genetic composition of polygenic selection.\n\nWebsite for simulation codehttps://github.com/MattHartfield/Polygenic-Selfing",

    "abstract": "Sesame is an ancient oilseed crop containing many valuable nutritional components. Recently, the demand for sesame seeds and their products has increased worldwide, making it necessary to enhance the development of high-yielding cultivars. One approach to enhance genetic gain in breeding programs is genomic selection. However, studies on genomic selection and genomic prediction in sesame are limited. In this study, we performed genomic prediction for agronomic traits using the phenotypes and genotypes of a sesame diversity panel grown under Mediterranean climatic conditions over two growing seasons. We aimed to assess the accuracy of prediction for nine important agronomic traits in sesame using single- and multi-environment analyses. In single-environment analysis, genomic best linear unbiased prediction, BayesB, BayesC, and reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces models showed no substantial differences. The average prediction accuracy of the nine traits across these models ranged from 0.39-0.79 for both growing seasons. In the multi-environment analysis, the marker-by-environment interaction model, which decomposed the marker effects into components shared across environments and environment-specific deviations, improved the prediction accuracies for all traits by 15%-58% compared to the single-environment model, particularly when borrowing information from other environments was made possible. Our results showed that single-environment analysis produced moderate-to-high genomic prediction accuracy for agronomic traits in sesame. The multi-environment analysis further enhanced this accuracy by exploiting marker-by-environment interaction. We concluded that genomic prediction using multi-environmental trial data could improve efforts for breeding cultivars adapted to the semi-arid Mediterranean climate.",

Seabirds, typically top predators in marine food chains, have been negatively affected by plastic pollution. Here we focused on documenting the sublethal effects of plastic in Wedge-tailed Shearwaters (Ardenna pacifica, WTSH) on the island of Maui, Hawaii. Through analyses of blood chemistry, gene expression, morphometrics and stomach contents, we documented the effects of plastic ingestion on adult WTHS from 3 established colonies. We detected a negative relationship between body weight and the presence of plastic in regurgitated stomach contents. Genes associated with metabolic, biosynthetic pathways, inflammatory responses and ribosome function were upregulated in lighter birds. Birds that had ingested plastic tended to be lighter in weight, in comparison to birds that did not have plastic and tended to weight more. Furthermore, there were 43 genes differentiating males and females that did not have plastic compared to only 11 genes differentiating males and females that had ingested plastic. There was also a marginal negative relationship between lighter birds and blood urea nitrogen levels. We also hope that the morphometric measurements, blood parameters and gene expression data we collected contributes to a database that will be used for future studies on understanding anthropogenic effects on seabird body condition.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial bc1 complex from yeast has ten subunits, but only Cytochrome b (Cytb) subunit is encoded in the mitochondrial genome. Cytb has eight transmembrane helices containing two hemes b for electron transfer. Cbp3 and Cbp6 assist Cytb synthesis, and together with Cbp4 induce Cytb hemylation. Subunits Qcr7/Qcr8 participate in the first steps of assembly, and lack of Qcr7 reduces Cytb synthesis through an assembly-feedback mechanism involving Cbp3/Cbp6. Since Qcr7 resides near the Cytb carboxyl-region, we wondered whether this region is important for Cytb synthesis/assembly. Although deletion of the Cytb C-region did not abrogate Cytb synthesis, the assembly-feedback regulation was lost, so Cytb synthesis was normal even if Qcr7 was missing. Mutants lacking the Cytb C-terminus were non-respiratory due to absence of fully assembled bc1 complex. By performing complexome profiling, we showed the existence of aberrant early-stage subassemblies in the mutant. In this work we demonstrate that the C-terminal region of Cytb is critical for regulation of Cytb synthesis and bc1 complex assembly.",

    "abstract": "Bromodomains are evolutionarily conserved structural motifs that recognize acetylated lysine residues on histone tails. They play a crucial role in shaping chromatin architecture and regulating gene expression in various biological processes. Mutations in bromodomains containing proteins leads to multiple human diseases, which makes them attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Extensive studies have been done on BRD4 as a target for several cancers, such as Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Burkitt Lymphoma. Several potential inhibitors have been identified against the BRD4 bromodomain. However, most of these inhibitors have drawbacks such as nonspecificity and toxicity, decreasing their appeal and necessitating the search for novel non-toxic inhibitors. This study aims to address this need by virtually screening natural compounds from the NPASS database against the Kac binding site of BRD4-BD1 using high throughput molecular docking followed by similarity clustering, pharmacokinetic screening, MD simulation, and MM-PBSA binding free energy calculations. Using this approach, we identified five natural product inhibitors having a similar or better binding affinity to the BRD4 bromodomain compared to JQ1 (previously reported inhibitor of BRD4). Further systematic analysis of these inhibitors resulted in the top three hits: NPC268484 (Palodesangren-B), NPC295021 (Candidine), and NPC313112 (Buxifoliadine-D). Collectively, our in silico results identified some promising natural products that have the potential to act as potent BRD4-BD1 inhibitors and can be considered for further validation through future in vitro and in vivo studies.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe study of functional diversity (FD) provides ways to understand phenomena as complex as community assembly or the dynamics of biodiversity change under multiple pressures. Different frameworks are used to quantify FD, either based on dissimilarity matrices (e.g., Rao entropy, functional dendrograms) or multidimensional spaces (e.g. convex hulls, kernel-density hypervolumes). While the first does not enable the measurement of FD within a richness/divergence/regularity framework, or results in the distortion of the functional space, the latter does not allow for comparisons with phylogenetic diversity (PD) measures and can be extremely sensitive to outliers.\nC_LIO_LIWe propose the use of neighbor-joining trees (NJ) to represent and quantify functional diversity in a way that combines the strengths of current FD frameworks without many of their weaknesses. Our proposal is also uniquely suited for studies that compare FD with PD, as both share the use of trees (NJ or others) and the same mathematical principles.\nC_LIO_LIWe test the ability of this novel framework to represent the initial functional distances between species with minimal functional space distortion and sensitivity to outliers. The results using NJ are compared with conventional functional dendrograms, convex hulls, and kernel-density hypervolumes using both simulated and empirical datasets.\nC_LIO_LIUsing NJ we demonstrate that it is possible to combine much of the flexibility provided by multidimensional spaces with the simplicity of tree-based representations. Moreover, the method is directly comparable with PD measures, and enables quantification of the richness, divergence and regularity of the functional space.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Separating, collecting, and detecting specific cells and molecules from complex and heterogeneous samples is key for many biomedical, environmental, and food safety applications. Antibodies are widely used to specifically bind cells and molecules to a solid support such as a column or suspended bead to separate, wash, and concentrate them. However, nonspecific binding of non-target cells and molecules to the support limits the specificity and resulting purity of traditional separation methods. Herein we describe a buoyant-antigen-magnetic (BAM) separation approach to increase specificity using two distinct separation processes with \"AND\" logic. Buoyant silica microbubbles and magnetic microbeads, each with their own antibody, bind to the target cell forming a BAM sandwich complex which can be separated from non-targeted cells (which are neither magnetic nor buoyant), as well as from cells bound to only single buoyant or magnetic microparticles but not both. Escherichia coli O157:H7, a pathogenic bacteria that can contaminate food products, was used as a model organism to establish a nearly 100-fold reduction in the non-specific carryover of non-target Escherichia coli bacteria in comparison to simple magnetic separation. Beads with no attached analyte were also removed. Furthermore, the BAM complexes could be visualized by eye (or camera) providing a rapid and sensitive method for pathogenic bacterial detection. Bacterial concentrations as low as 5 x 104 CFU/ml were evident by eye and could easily be distinguished from non-target S. aureus bacteria even at much higher concentrations (5x107 cfu/mL). This approach enabled simple user-friendly measurement for on-site detection and isolation without expensive equipment.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=77 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517249v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@194c382org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1afcd3dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cba148org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c9b6cb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Visible light optical coherence tomography (VIS-OCT) is an emerging imaging modality that uses shorter wavelength in visible light range than conventional near infrared (NIR) light. It provides one-micron level axial resolution to improve image contrast to better separate stratified retinal layers, as well as provides microvascular oximetry with spatio-spectral analysis. However, due to the practical limitation of laser safety and comfort, the permissible illumination power is much lower than NIR OCT which can be challenging to obtain high quality VIS-OCT images and subsequent image analysis particularly in pathological eyes. Therefore, improving VIS-OCT image quality by denoising is an essential step in the overall workflow in VIS-OCT clinical applications. In this paper, we provide the first VIS-OCT retinal image dataset from normal eyes, including retinal layer annotation and noisy-clean image pairs. We propose an efficient co-learning deep learning framework for noisy-input segmentation embedded with a self-supervised denoising process. The same neural network performed both denoising and segmentation tasks simultaneously. The task performance is benchmarked qualitatively and quantitatively. The significant improvement of segmentation (2% higher Dice coefficient compared to segmentation-only process) for certain layers is observed when available annotation drops to 25%, indicating a potential angle for annotation-efficient training.",

    "abstract": "The spatial architecture of the genome can be categorized into distinct layers. Each layer plays a critical role in transcriptional regulation and/or genomic integrity. Alterations at any level of the 3D genome can lead to an unwanted cascade of molecular events, which may ultimately drive the manifestation of disease. However, a comprehensive atlas of the mutations and structural genetic defects that affect genome organization has yet to be compiled. Moreover, we lack a centralized resource for interpretating the pathological effects of such genetic mutations. Therefore, we curated from the literature all the pathological alterations from the chromosome level on down to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in order to investigate these diverse genetic mutations. Using a two-phase scoring algorithm, 3DFunc, we scored the transcriptomic causality of all variants in the context of 3D genome architecture from 20 cancer and 15 normal tissues. Further, 3DFunc can identify pathological variant-gene pairs in non-oncological diseases. Finally, we constructed a web-based database, 3DGeOD (https://www.csuligroup.com/3DGeOD/home), to provide all the curated variants, genomic disruptions, as well as the scoring results derived from 3DFunc. In summary, our study constructed a 3D genome atlas of genetic variants and will serve as a valuable resource for mining the putative pathological effects of any genetic mutation.",

Here, by analyzing 1,960 RNA-Seq samples from three independent datasets, we explored the co-expression landscape in HCs, by inferring gene co-expression networks (GCNs) with four cancer phenotypes (B and T-cell acute leukemia -BALL, TALL-, acute myeloid leukemia -AML-, and multiple myeloma -MM-) as well as non-cancer bone marrow. We characterized their structure (topological features) and function (enrichment analyses). We found that, as in other types of cancer, the highest co-expression interactions are intra-chromosomal, which is not the case for control GCNs. We also detected a highly co-expressed group of overexpressed pseudogenes in HC networks. The four GCNs present only a small fraction of common interactions, related to canonical functions, like immune response or erythrocyte differentiation. With this approach, we were able to reveal cancer-specific features useful for detection of disease manifestations.\n\nSignificanceWe demonstrate that gene co-expression is deregulated in four HC, observed by an elevated proportion of intrachromosome interactions in their GCNs with respect to their normal counterparts, and increased interactions between pseudogenes (more evident in AML).

However, differences in data modalities, multicollinearity of the data, and large numbers of irrelevant features make the analyses and integration of high-dimensional omic datasets challenging. Here, we present Significant Latent factor Interaction Discovery and Exploration (SLIDE), a first-in-class interpretable machine learning technique for identifying significant interacting latent factors underlying outcomes of interest from high-dimensional omic datasets. SLIDE makes no assumptions regarding data-generating mechanisms, comes with theoretical guarantees regarding identifiability of the latent factors/corresponding inference, outperforms/performs at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches in terms of prediction, and provides inference beyond prediction. Using SLIDE on scRNA-seq data from systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients, we first uncovered significant interacting latent factors underlying SSc pathogenesis. In addition to accurately predicting SSc severity and outperforming existing benchmarks, SLIDE uncovered significant factors that included well-elucidated altered transcriptomic states in myeloid cells and fibroblasts, an intriguing keratinocyte-centric signature validated by protein staining, and a novel mechanism involving altered HLA signaling in myeloid cells, that has support in genetic data. SLIDE also worked well on spatial transcriptomic data and was able to accurately identify significant interacting latent factors underlying immune cell partitioning by 3D location within lymph nodes. Finally, SLIDE leveraged paired scRNA-seq and TCR-seq data to elucidate latent factors underlying extents of clonal expansion of CD4 T cells in a nonobese diabetic model of T1D. The latent factors uncovered by SLIDE included well-known activation markers, inhibitory receptors and intracellular regulators of receptor signaling, but also honed in on several novel naive and memory states that standard analyses missed. Overall, SLIDE is a versatile engine for biological discovery from modern multi-omic datasets.",

    "abstract": "Moving and holding still have been posited to be under separate control regimes for both eye and arm movements. The paretic arm after stroke is notable for abnormalities both at rest and during movement, thus it provides an opportunity to address the relationships between control of reaching, stopping, and stabilizing. In this study, we asked whether independence of these behaviors is preserved in arm paresis. To address this question, we quantified resting postural abnormalities in stroke patients by measuring their biases in force production as they held their hand still in various locations in a planar workspace, and then assessed the influence of these resting force biases on active reaching in the same workspace. We found that patients had marked resting postural force biases at each location, even for the case when arm support was provided. However, these biases did not manifest during any phase of arm-supported planar reaching movements: not during initial acceleration, not to mid-trajectory perturbations, and not during deceleration to a stop. Resting force biases only appeared to switch on after a movement had fully stopped. These findings in stroke suggest that moving and holding still are functionally separable modes of control. At the same time, we found that patients resting postural force biases mirrored characteristics of abnormal synergies active during movement: they markedly decreased when arm support was provided; they were higher in more distal positions which require breaking out of flexion; and they scaled with the Fugl-Meyer score for the upper extremity (a measure of intrusion of abnormal synergies during active movement). These three shared features suggest a common mechanism for resting postural biases and abnormal synergies, which appears to be a contradiction given the functional separation of moving and holding still observed in the same patients. To resolve this apparent paradox, we propose a model that predicts a breakdown in the functional separation between reaching and holding still when patients move in the absence of weight support. Thus, the model posits that synergies are the behavioral manifestation of a spillover of posture into movement. Mapping these functional systems onto anatomical and physiological details of lesioned substrate after stroke may provide implementation-level insight into how normal arm motor control is assembled.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between obesity and brain structure is incompletely understood. Using diffusion-weighted MRI from [~]30,000 UK Biobank participants we test the hypothesis that obesity (waist-to-hip ratio, WHR) is associated with regional differences in two micro-structural MRI metrics: isotropic volume fraction (ISOVF), an index of free water, and intra-cellular volume fraction (ICVF), an index of neurite density. We observed significant associations with obesity in two coupled but distinct brain systems: a prefrontal-temporal-striatal system associated with ISOVF and a medial temporal-occipital-striatal system associated with ICVF. The ISOVF[~]WHR system colocated with expression of genes enriched for innate immune functions, decreased glial density, and high mu opioid (MOR) and other neurotransmitter receptor density. Conversely, the ICVF[~]WHR system co-located with expression of genes enriched for G-protein coupled receptors and decreased density of MOR and other receptors. To test whether these distinct brain phenotypes might differ in terms of their underlying shared genetics or relationship to maps of the inflammatory marker C-reactive Protein (CRP), we estimated the genetic correlations between WHR and ISOVF (rg = 0.026, P = 0.36) and ICVF (rg = 0.112, P < 9 x 10-4) as well as comparing correlations between WHR maps and equivalent CRP maps for ISOVF and ICVF (p<0.05). These correlational results are consistent with a two-way mechanistic model whereby genetically determined differences in neurite density in the medial temporal system may contribute to obesity, whereas water content in the prefrontal system could reflect a consequence of obesity mediated by innate immune system activation.",

    "abstract": "It is well known that the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR) in the brainstem, part of the efferent network, inhibits the cochlear active gain mechanism. The upstream neural influence of this peripheral inhibition is less understood. When the MOCR is activated, responses generated in the cochlea and cortex undergo putative attenuation, yet the amplitude of responses generated in the brainstem are perplexingly unaffected despite decreased input from the periphery. Based on known neural circuitry, we hypothesized that the inhibition of peripheral input is compensated for by equivalent positive feedback in the brainstem over time. We predicted that the inhibition can be captured at the brainstem with stimuli shorter (1.5 s) than previously employed long durations (4 min) where this inhibition is diminished due to compensation. Results from 18 normal hearing human listeners support our hypothesis in that when the MOCR is activated, there is a robust reduction of responses generated at the periphery, brainstem, and cortex for short stimuli and that brainstem inhibition diminishes for longer stimuli. Our methodology and findings have implications for auditory disorders such as tinnitus, evaluation of efferent function, and provides a novel non-invasive window into potential gain compensation mechanisms in the brainstem.",

    "abstract": "People tend to view themselves through rose-tinted glasses, as evidenced by preferential recall of positive personality traits. We asked whether reactivating positive personality traits during sleep could enhance peoples positive self-evaluative memories. After a baseline self-referential encoding task in which participants endorsed positive and negative traits as self-descriptive, participants were trained to give timely responses to positive traits in a cue-approach training (CAT) task. Once participants had entered slow-wave sleep during a subsequent nap, half of the trained positive traits were unobtrusively re-played to them to promote consolidation (targeted memory reactivation, TMR). Participants completed free-recall tasks about self-descriptive traits to measure their self-evaluative memories. Our findings revealed that TMR prioritized the recall of positive traits that were strongly memorized before sleep, while impairing the recall of intermediate traits. The results suggest pre-TMR self-evaluative memory strength modulated the TMR benefits. Sleep EEG analyses revealed that compared with weak/intermediate/control traits, re-playing strongly memorized traits during sleep elicited greater sigma power changes, which likely reflect preferential memory reactivation. Our results demonstrate the potential implication of wakeful cue-approach training and sleep-based memory reactivation in strengthening positive self-evaluative memories.",

    "abstract": "When multiple viral populations propagate within the same host environment, they often shape each others dynamics. These interactions can be positive or negative and can occur at multiple scales, from coinfection of a cell to co-circulation at a global population level. For influenza A viruses (IAVs), the delivery of multiple viral genomes to a cell substantially increases burst size. However, despite its relevance for IAV evolution through reassortment, the implications of this positive density dependence for coinfection between distinct IAVs has not been explored. Furthermore, the extent to which these interactions within the cell shape viral dynamics at the level of the host remains unclear. Here we show that, within cells, coinfecting IAVs strongly augment the replication of a focal strain, irrespective of the native host of the coinfecting IAV or its homology to the focal strain. Coinfecting viruses with a low intrinsic reliance on multiple infection offer the greatest benefit. Nevertheless, virus-virus interactions at the level of the whole host are antagonistic. This antagonism is recapitulated in cell culture when the coinfecting virus is introduced several hours prior to the focal strain or under conditions conducive to multiple rounds of viral replication. Together, these data suggest that beneficial virus-virus interactions within cells are counterbalanced by competition for susceptible cells during viral propagation through a tissue. The integration of virus-virus interactions across scales is critical in defining the outcomes of viral coinfection.",

Using an antibiotic-producing Penicillium isolate and the cheese rind microbial community, we demonstrate that a fungal specialized metabolite can regulate the diversity of bacterial communities. Inactivation of the global regulator, LaeA, resulted in the loss of antibacterial activity in the Penicillium isolate. Cheese rind bacterial communities assembled with the laeA deletion strain had significantly higher bacterial abundances than the wild-type strain. RNA-sequencing and metabolite profiling demonstrated a striking reduction in the expression and production of the natural product pseurotin in the laeA deletion strain. Inactivation of a core gene in the pseurotin biosynthetic cluster restored bacterial community composition, demonstrating the role of pseurotins in mediating bacterial community assembly. Our discovery demonstrates how antibiotic production can drive the assembly of microbiomes and provides an ecological context for widespread fungal specialized metabolites.",

    "abstract": "MotivationCell function is regulated by gene regulatory networks (GRNs) defined by protein-mediated interaction between constituent genes. Despite advances in experimental techniques, we can still measure only a fraction of the processes that govern GRN dynamics. To infer the properties of GRNs using partial observation, unobserved sequential processes can be replaced with distributed time delays, yielding non-Markovian models. Inference methods based on the resulting model suffer from the curse of dimensionality.\n\nResultsWe develop a simulation-based Bayesian MCMC method for the efficient and accurate inference of GRN parameters when only some of their products are observed. We illustrate our approach using a two-step activation model: An activation signal leads to the accumulation of an unobserved regulatory protein, which triggers the expression of observed fluorescent proteins. With prior information about observed fluorescent protein synthesis, our method successfully infers the dynamics of the unobserved regulatory protein. We can estimate the delay and kinetic parameters characterizing target regulation including transcription, translation, and target searching of an unobserved protein from experimental measurements of the products of its target gene. Our method is scalable and can be used to analyze non-Markovian models with hidden components.\n\nAvailabilityAccompanying code in R is available at https://github.com/Mathbiomed/SimMCMC.\n\nContactjaekkim@kaist.ac.kr or kresimir.josic@gmail.com or cbskust@korea.ac.kr\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Multibank retinas have rod photoreceptors stacked into multiple layers. They are found in many species of fish that inhabit dim environments and are one of the most common visual adaptations in the deep-sea. Despite its prevalence, the function of multibank retinas remained unknown. Two predominant theories, neither of which has been tested, have emerged: 1) they enhance sensitivity in dim light, and 2) they allow colour vision in dim light. To investigate the sensitivity hypothesis, we performed electrophysiological recordings and compared the rod pigments of three species of nocturnal reef fishes, two with a multibank retina (Neoniphon sammara and Myripristis violacea) and a control species with a single rod bank (Ostorhinchus compressus). Results indicated that nocturnal reef fishes with a multibank retina have higher temporal resolution of vision, as indicated by electrophysiology, and that their rhodopsin proteins likely also have faster retinal release kinetics, as suggested by amino acid substitutions. Electrophysiology also showed that the multibank retina conferred greater sensitivity to both dim and bright intensities than a single rod bank and this occurred at times when rod-derived signals usually dominate the visual response. This study provides the first functional evidence for enhanced dim-light sensitivity using a multibank retina while also suggesting novel roles for the adaptation in enhancing bright-light sensitivity and the speed of vision.\n\nSignificanceMost vertebrates have one layer of the dim-light active rod photoreceptors; however, some species have multiple layers, known as a multibank retina. We used electrophysiology on nocturnal reef fishes with and without multibank retinas to evaluate the sensory advantage of having multiple rod layers. We show that fish with multibank retinas have both faster vision and enhanced sensitivity to bright and dim light intensities. Thus, we resolve for the first time the function of multibank retinas - one of the most common visual adaptations in the deep sea. Our findings highlight an unconventional vertebrate visual system as well as the visual capabilities of fishes from the most vast (deep sea) and vibrant (reefs) ecosystems on the planet.",

    "abstract": "Eye movements alter the relationship between the visual and auditory spatial scenes. Signals related to eye movements affect neural pathways from the ear through auditory cortex and beyond, but how these signals contribute to computing the locations of sounds with respect to the visual scene is poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the information contained in eye movement-related eardrum oscillations (EMREOs), pressure changes recorded in the ear canal that occur in conjunction with simultaneous eye movements. We show that EMREOs contain parametric information about horizontal and vertical eye displacement as well as initial/final eye position with respect to the head. The parametric information in the horizontal and vertical directions can be modelled as combining linearly, allowing accurate prediction of the EMREOs associated with oblique (diagonal) eye movements. Target location can also be inferred from the EMREO signals recorded during eye movements to those targets. We hypothesize that the (currently unknown) mechanism underlying EMREOs could impose a two-dimensional eye-movement related transfer function on any incoming sound, permitting subsequent processing stages to compute the positions of sounds in relation to the visual scene.\n\nSignificance StatementWhen the eyes move, the alignment between the visual and auditory scenes changes. We are not perceptually aware of these shifts -- which indicates that the brain must incorporate accurate information about eye movements into auditory and visual processing. Here we show that the small sounds generated within the ear by the brain contain accurate information about contemporaneous eye movements in the spatial domain: the direction and amplitude of the eye movements could be inferred from these small sounds. The underlying mechanism(s) likely involve(s) the ears various motor structures, and could facilitate the translation of incoming auditory signals into a frame of reference anchored to the direction of the eyes and hence the visual scene.",

    "abstract": "Psychophysical experiments explored how the repeated presentation of a context, consisting of an adaptor and a target, induces plasticity in the localization of an identical target presented alone on interleaved trials. The plasticity, and its time course, was examined both in a classroom and in an anechoic chamber. Adaptors and targets were 2-ms noise clicks and listeners were tasked with localizing the targets while ignoring the adaptors (when present). The context had either a fixed temporal structure, consisting of a single-click adaptor and a target, or its structure varied from trial to trial, either containing a single-click or an 8-click adaptor. The adaptor was presented either from a frontal or a lateral location, fixed within a run. The presence of context caused responses to the isolated targets to be displaced up to 14{degrees} away from the adaptor location. This effect was stronger and slower if the context was variable, growing over the 5-minute duration of the runs. Additionally, the fixed-context buildup had a slower onset in the classroom. Overall, the results illustrate that sound localization is subject to slow adaptive processes that depend on the spatial and temporal structure of the context and on the level of reverberation in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal response to sensory stimuli characterizes multiple neuropsychiatric conditions. However, not many tools are currently available to assess somatosensory abnormalities in rodent models of brain disorders, limiting the possibilities to study cellular and molecular correlates of this phenotypic trait. To this goal, previous studies relied on the whisker nuisance test (WNt), in which freely moving mice are constantly stimulated on their whiskers using a wood stick for a set time. The whisker-guided response is then deconstructed in behavioral categories indicative of either anxiety or curiosity. Thus far, WNt was shown to be a valuable tool to investigate sensory-driven abnormalities in mouse models of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), demonstrating a solid translational validity. Nevertheless, assessment of behavioral response in the WNt is currently limited by the lack of an objective quantification method. To overcome this limitation, we developed WNt3R (Whisker Nuisance Test in 3D for Rodents), a MATLAB toolbox that uses the output of the open-source software DeepLabCut to determine discrete body postures associated with multiple ethologically-relevant behaviors. Our results show that behavioral modules identified using WNt3R reliably decode mouse body postures, outperforming the manual user, thus offering a novel and unbiased approach to study altered somatosensory function in rodents.",

These proteins biomarkers however are often masked by the presence of more abundant functional blood proteins, making specific detection a challenge with most current immunoassays. We we report on the development of a magnetic bead based solid-phase PEA (SP-PEA) for sensitive detection of proteins in plasma and serum samples. Antibody functionalized magnetic beads are used to capture the target of interest. Following capture, non-specifically bound proteins are washed off before PEA probes are added for detection of the bound proteins. Compared to hoogenous PEA, SP-PEA admits the use of larger sample volumes to increase available target molecules, higher concentration of detection reagents for more efficient formation of detection complexes and washes for removal of nonspecific background. We compared SP-PEA to solution phase PEA for the detection of cytokines: interlukin-6, interlukin-2, interlukin-4, interlukin-10 and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, and we demonstrated an increased sensitivity by 15 to 60 fold in buffer and chicken serum.

In this work, we show that Snail1 is activated in the melanoma microenvironment, particularly in fibroblasts. Analysis of murine models that allow stromal Snail1 depletion and therapeutic Snail1 blockade indicate that targeting Snail1 activation in the tumour microenvironment decreases melanoma growth and lung metastatic burden, extending mice survival. Transcriptomic analysis of melanoma-associated fibroblasts and analysis of the tumours indicate that stromal Snail1 induces melanoma growth by promoting an immunosuppressive microenvironment and pro-tumour immunity.

Precise optical measurements of neurotransmitter release may be used to make inferences about presynaptic function independent of electrophysiological measurement techniques. Here, we express iGluSnFR, a genetically encoded glutamate reporter in mouse spiral ganglion neurons to compare electrophysiological and optical readouts of presynaptic function and short-term synaptic plasticity at the endbulb of Held synapse. We conclude that iGluSnFR robustly and approximately linearly reports glutamate release from the endbulb of Held during synaptic transmission and allows assessment of short-term plasticity during high-frequency train stimuli. Furthermore, we show that iGluSnFR expression slightly alters the time course of spontaneous postsynaptic currents, but is unlikely to impact measurements of evoked synchronous release of many synaptic vesicles.",

    "abstract": "When visual stimuli are presented at a sufficiently high temporal frequency, visual perception shifts from the static to dynamic vision mode, thereby facilitating a continuity illusion which is key for correctly identifying continuous and moving objects and placing them in the context of the surrounding environment. However, how this continuity illusion is encoded along the entire visual pathway remains poorly understood, with disparate Flicker Fusion Frequency (FFF) thresholds measured at retinal, cortical, and behavioural levels. Here, we hypothesized that these disparities may suggest that other brain areas may be involved in encoding the shift from static to dynamic vision modes. We employ a comprehensive approach encompassing behavioural measurements, whole brain activation mapping with high fidelity functional MRI (fMRI), and local electrophysiological validation for studying the mechanisms underlying the shift from static to dynamic vision modes in the rat. Our behavioural measurements reported an FFF threshold proxy of 18{+/-}2 Hz. At the network level, functional MRI revealed that the superior colliculus (SC) exhibits marked signal transitions from positive to negative fMRI signal regimes at the behaviourally measured FFF threshold surrogates, with a strong linear correlation between fMRI signal and behaviour, while thalamic and cortical visual areas displayed a significantly poorer correlation with the behaviour. fMRI-driven neurometric curves approximated the behavioural psychometric curve in SC but not in the other visual areas. Electrophysiological recordings in SC suggested that these fMRI signals transitions arise from strong neural activation/suppression at low/high frequency regimes, respectively, and that a transition between these regimes occurs around the measured FFF threshold proxies. Lesions in V1 further reinforced that these transitions originate in SC. Combined, our data suggests a critical role for SC in encoding temporal frequency discriminations, in particular the shifts from the static to the dynamic vision modes.",
