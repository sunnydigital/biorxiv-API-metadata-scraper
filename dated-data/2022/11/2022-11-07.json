    "abstract": "This study examines temporal gene expression (GE) patterns in a murine model of SARS-CoV infection. We focused on a Temporal Gene Set (TGS) comprising pro-inflammatory genes (TNF, NFKB1, VEGF-A) and VEGF-B. A systematic search of the NCBI Geo database for MA15 (SARS-CoV) pulmonary studies using C57BL Wild (WT) mice and filtering according to TGS GE patterns eluded seven datasets for further analysis. Encompassing the GE profiles from these datasets alluded to a rising and falling pattern in TNF and NFKB1 GE. Also, our findings reveal a temporal decrease in VEGF-A GE coinciding with an increase in VEGF-B GE post-immunogenic stimulation. Notably, differential responses were observed with the MA15 dosage and in comparison, to other antigens (dORF6 and NSP16). Further, the human SARS-CoV-2 gene enrichment in this murine study confirms the MA15 murine models relevance for SARS research. Our study also suggests potential interactions between SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein and VEGF-related receptors, hinting at other pathophysiological mechanisms. Our results indicate severe inflammation may lead to a flattened VEGF-B GE response, influencing VEGF-Bs cell survival role. We underline the significance of considering VEGF-A/B interactions, particularly temporal differences, in manipulating angiogenic processes. Future research needs to consider temporal changes in VEGF-A and VEGF-B GE, in terms of time-associated gene-switching, in line with changing host inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum bicolor is one of the most important cereals in the world and a staple crop for smallholder famers in sub-Saharan Africa. However approximately 20% of sorghum yield is annually lost on the African continent due to infestation with the root parasitic weed Striga hermonthica. Existing Striga management strategies often show an inconsistent to low efficacy. Hence, novel and integrated approaches are needed as an alternative strategy. Here, we demonstrate that the soil microbiome suppresses Striga infection in sorghum. We associate this suppression with microbiome-mediated induction of root endodermal suberization and aerenchyma formation, and depletion of haustorium inducing factors (HIFs), root exudate compounds that are critical for the initial stages of Striga infection. We further identify microbial taxa associated with reduced Striga infection with concomitant changes in root cellular anatomy and differentiation as well as HIF degradation. Our study describes novel microbiome-mediated mechanisms of Striga suppression, encompassing repression of haustorium formation and induction of physical barriers in the host root tissue. These findings open new avenues to broaden the effectiveness of Striga management practices.",

    "abstract": "Patient-specific premorbidity, age, and sex are significant heterogeneous factors that influence the severe manifestation of lung diseases, including COVID-19 fibrosis. The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a prominent role in regulating effects of these factors. Recent evidence suggests that patient-specific alteration of RAS homeostasis with premorbidity and the expression level of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), depending on age and sex, is correlated with lung fibrosis. However, conflicting evidence suggests decreases, increases, or no changes in RAS after SARS-CoV-2 infection. In addition, detailed mechanisms connecting the patient-specific conditions before infection to infection-induced fibrosis are still unknown. Here, a mathematical model is developed to quantify the systemic contribution of heterogeneous factors of RAS in the progression of lung fibrosis. Three submodels are connected--a RAS model, an agent-based COVID-19 in-host immune response model, and a fibrosis model--to investigate the effects of patient-group-specific factors in the systemic alteration of RAS and collagen deposition in the lung. The model results indicate cell death due to inflammatory response as a major contributor to the reduction of ACE and ACE2, whereas there are no significant changes in ACE2 dynamics due to viral-bound internalization of ACE2. Reduction of ACE reduces the homeostasis of RAS including angiotensin II (ANGII), while the decrease in ACE2 increases ANGII and results in severe lung injury and fibrosis. The model explains possible mechanisms for conflicting evidence of RAS alterations in previously published studies. Also, the results show that ACE2 variations with age and sex significantly alter RAS peptides and lead to fibrosis with around 20% additional collagen deposition from systemic RAS with slight variations depending on age and sex. This model may find further applications in patient-specific calibrations of tissue models for acute and chronic lung diseases to develop personalized treatments.",

    "abstract": "Most known viruses protect their genome by encapsulating it inside a protein capsid. Viral capsids can adopt various geometries, most iconically characterized by icosahedral or helical symmetries. The assembly process of native capsids is highly cooperative and governed by the protein geometry, protein-protein as well as protein-nucleic acid interactions. Importantly, the absolute control over the size and shape of virus capsids would have imminent advantages in the development of new vaccines and delivery systems. However, tools to direct the assembly process in a programmable manner are exceedingly elusive or strictly limited to specific structures. Here, we introduce a modular approach by demonstrating DNA origami directed polymorphism of single protein subunit capsids. We achieve control over the capsid shape, size, and topology by employing user-defined DNA origami nanostructures as binding and assembly platforms for the capsid proteins. Binding assays and single-particle cryo-electron microscopy reconstruction show that the DNA origami nanoshapes are efficiently encapsulated within the capsid. Further, we observe that helical arrangement of hexameric capsomers is the preferred mode of packing, while a negative curvature of the origami structure is not well tolerated. The capsid proteins assemble on DNA origami in single or double layer configurations depending on the applied stoichiometry. In addition, the obtained viral capsid coatings are able to efficiently shield the encapsulated DNA origami from nuclease degradation and prevent the structures from aggregation. Therefore, these findings may in addition find direct implementations in DNA nanotechnology-based bioengineering by paving the way for the next-generation cargo protection and targeting strategies.",

    "abstract": "Reinforcement feedback can improve motor learning, but the underlying brain mechanisms remain underexplored. Especially, the causal contribution of specific patterns of oscillatory activity within the human striatum is unknown. To address this question, we exploited an innovative, non-invasive deep brain stimulation technique called transcranial Temporal Interference Stimulation (tTIS) during reinforcement motor learning with concurrent neuroimaging, in a randomised, sham-controlled, double-blind study. Striatal tTIS applied at 80Hz, but not at 20Hz, abolished the benefits of reinforcement on motor learning. This effect was related to a selective modulation of neural activity within the striatum. Moreover, 80Hz, but not 20Hz tTIS increased the neuromodulatory influence of the striatum on frontal areas involved in reinforcement motor learning. These results show for the first time that tTIS can non-invasively and selectively modulate a striatal mechanism involved in reinforcement learning, opening new horizons for the study of causal relationships between deep brain structures and human behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Microstate analysis is a promising technique for analyzing high-density electroencephalographic data, but there are multiple questions about methodological best practices. Between and within individuals, microstates can differ both in terms of characteristic topographies and temporal dynamics, which leads to analytic challenges as the measurement of microstate dynamics is dependent on assumptions about their topographies. Here we focus on the analysis of group differences, using simulations seeded on real data from healthy control subjects to compare approaches that derive separate sets of maps within subgroups versus a single set of maps applied uniformly to the entire dataset. In the absence of true group differences in either microstate maps or temporal metrics, we found that using separate subgroup maps resulted in substantially inflated type I error rates. On the other hand, when groups truly differed in their microstate maps, analyses based on a single set of maps confounded topographic effects with differences in other derived metrics. We propose an approach to alleviate both classes of bias, based on a paired analysis of all subgroup maps. We illustrate the qualitative and quantitative impact of these issues in real data by comparing waking versus non-rapid eye movement sleep microstates. Overall, our results suggest that even subtle chance differences in microstate topography can have profound effects on derived microstate metrics and that future studies using microstate analysis should take steps to mitigate this large source of error.",

    "abstract": "Crossmodal correspondences describe our tendency to associate sensory features from different modalities with each other, such as the pitch of a sound with the size of a visual object. While such crossmodal correspondences (or associations) are described in many behavioural studies their neurophysiological correlates remain unclear. Under the current working model of multisensory perception both a low- and a high-level account seem plausible. That is, the neurophysiological processes shaping these associations could commence in low-level sensory regions, or may predominantly emerge in high-level association regions of semantic and object identification networks. We exploited steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) to directly probe this question, focusing on the associations between pitch and the visual features of size, hue or chromatic saturation. We found that SSVEPs over occipital regions are sensitive to the congruency between pitch and size, and a source analysis pointed to an origin around primary visual cortices. We speculate that this signature of the pitch-size association in low-level visual cortices reflects the successful pairing of congruent visual and acoustic object properties and may contribute to establishing causal relations between multisensory objects.",

    "abstract": "One signature of the human brain is its ability to derive knowledge from language inputs, in addition to nonlinguistic sensory channels such as vision and touch. How does human language experience specifically modulate the way in which semantic knowledge is stored in the human brain? We investigated this question using a unique early-life language-deprivation human model: early deaf adults who are born to hearing parents and thus had delayed acquisition of any natural human language (speech or sign), with early deaf adults who acquired sign language from birth as nonlinguistic sensory experience controls. Neural responses in a meaning judgment task with 90 written words that were familiar to both groups were measured using fMRI. The early language-deprived group, compared with the deaf control group, showed reduced semantic sensitivity, in both multivariate pattern (semantic structure encoding) and univariate (abstractness effect) analyses, in the left dorsal anterior temporal lobe (dATL). These results provide positive, causal evidence that the neural semantic representation in dATL is specifically supported by language, as a unique mechanism of representing (abstract) semantic space, beyond the sensory-derived semantic representations distributed in the other cortical regions.",

    "abstract": "Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a potent classic serotonergic psychedelic, which facilitates a variety of altered states of consciousness. Here we present the first meta-analysis establishing dose-response relationship estimates of the altered experience induced by LSD. Data extracted from articles identified by a systematic literature review following PRISMA guidelines were obtained from the Altered States Database. The psychometric data comprised ratings of subjective effects from standardized and validated questionnaires: the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC, 11-ASC) and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30). We performed meta-regression analyses using restricted cubic splines for data from studies with LSD doses of up to 200 g base. Most scales revealed a sigmoid-like increase of effects with a plateauing at around 100 g. The most strongly modulated factors referred to changes in perception and illusory imagination, followed by positively experienced ego-dissolution, while only small effects were found for Anxiety and Dread of Ego Dissolution. The partly observed considerable variability of effects points to the importance of non-pharmacological effects on subjective experiences. The established dose-response relationships may be used as general references for future experimental and clinical research on LSD to relate observed with expected subjective effects and to elucidate phenomenological differences between psychedelics.",

    "abstract": "Contemporary models conceptualize spatial attention as a blinking spotlight that sequentially samples visual space. Hence, behavior fluctuates over time even in states of presumed  sustained attention. Recent evidence suggested that rhythmic neural activity in the frontoparietal network constitutes the functional basis of rhythmic attentional sampling. However, causal evidence to support this notion remains absent. Using a lateralized spatial attention task, we addressed this issue in patients with focal lesions in the frontoparietal attention network. Our results uncovered that frontoparietal lesions introduce periodic neglect, i.e., temporally-specific behavioral deficits that were aligned with the underlying neural oscillations. Attention-guided perceptual sensitivity was on par with healthy controls during optimal phases but attenuated during the less excitable sub-cycles. Theta-dependent sampling (3 - 8 Hz) was causally dependent on prefrontal cortex, while alpha-band sampling (8 - 14 Hz) emerged from parietal areas. Collectively, our findings reveal that lesion-induced high amplitude, low frequency brain activity is not epiphenomenal, but has immediate behavioral consequences. More generally, these results provide causal evidence for the hypothesis that the functional architecture of attention is inherently rhythmic.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMagnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) can non-invasively measure levels of endogenous metabolites in living tissue and is of great interest to neuroscience and clinical research. To this day, MRS data analysis workflows differ substantially between groups, frequently requiring many manual steps to be performed on individual datasets, e.g., data renaming/sorting, manual execution of analysis scripts, and manual assessment of success/failure. Manual analysis practices are a substantial barrier to wider uptake of MRS. They also increase the likelihood of human error and prevent deployment of MRS at large scale. Here, we demonstrate an end-to-end workflow for fully automated data uptake, processing, and quality review.\n\nNew MethodThe proposed continuous automated MRS analysis workflow integrates several recent innovations in MRS data and file storage conventions. They are efficiently deployed by a directory monitoring service that automatically triggers the following steps upon arrival of a new raw MRS dataset in a project folder: (1) conversion from proprietary manufacturer file formats into the universal format NIfTI-MRS; (2) consistent file system organization according to the data accumulation logic standard BIDS-MRS; (3) executing a command-line executable of our open-source end-to-end analysis software Osprey; (4) e-mail delivery of a quality control summary report for all analysis steps.\n\nResultsThe automated architecture successfully completed for a demonstration dataset. The only manual step required was to copy a raw data folder into a monitored directory.\n\nComparison with Existing Method(s)The workflow presented here is the first implementation of a continuous automated MRS analysis ecosystem based on NIfTI-MRS and BIDS-MRS standards. Traditional MRS workflows are non-standardized, often require manual input, and frequently noy compatible with established neuroimaging workflows. This workflow should therefore facilitate integration of MRS into large-scale and multi-center studies.\n\nConclusionsContinuous automated analysis of MRS data can reduce the burden of manual data analysis and quality control, particularly for non-expert users and multi-center or large-scale studies.",

    "abstract": "Botrytis cinerea, a generalist fungal pathogen of economically important crop species, has been shown to exhibit reduced sensitivity to fungicides and plant toxins. Specifically, previous reports indicate B. cinereas efficacy in tolerating a wide array of phytoalexins, toxic plant metabolites that play key role in plant immune defense strategies. Previously, we have shown that a distinct set of genes was induced in B. cinerea when treated with phytoalexins derived from different plant species such as rishitin (tomato and potato), capsidiol (tobacco and bell pepper) or resveratrol (grape and blueberry). In this study, we focused on the functional analyses of B. cinerea genes induced by rishitin treatment. B. cinerea can metabolize rishitin to at least 4 oxidized forms. Heterologous expression of rishitin-induced B. cinerea genes in the plant symbiotic fungus, Epichloe festucae, revealed that oxidoreductase (Bcin08g04910) and cytochrome P450 (Bcin16g01490) genes are involved in the oxidation of rishitin. BcatrB is an exporter of structurally unrelated anti-microbial compounds such as resveratrol, camalexin and fungicide fenpicionil. Expression of BcatrB is upregulated by rishitin, but not by structurally resembling capsidiol. BcatrB knock out transformants ({Delta}bcatrB) showed enhanced sensitivity to rishitin, but not to capsidiol. Likewise,{Delta} bcatrB showed reduced virulence on tomato fruits (which produce rishitin), but showed full virulence on Nicotiana benthamiana (which mainly produces capsidiol), suggesting that B. cinerea distinguishes phytoalexins and activates expression of appropriate transporter genes during the infection. Activation of BcatrB promoter was detected using P_BcatrB:GFP transformant during the B. cinerea infection in plant tissues. Surveying of 26 plant species across 13 families revealed that the BcatrB promoter is mainly activated during the infection of plants belonging to the Solanaceae, Fabaceae and Brassicaceae families. The BcatrB promoter is activated by the treatment with Fabaceae phytoalexins medicarpin and glyceollin, and{Delta} bcatrB showed reduced virulence on red clover, which produces medicarpin. These results suggest that BcatrB plays a critical role in the strategy employed by B. cinerea to bypass the plant innate immune responses in a wide variety of important crops belonging to the Solanaceae, Brassicaceae and Fabaceae families.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation, the conversion of N2 gas into a more bioavailable form, is vital to sustaining marine primary production. Studies have shifted beyond traditionally studied tropical diazotrophs. Candidatus Atelocyanobacterium thalassa (or UCYN-A) has emerged as a research focal point due to its streamlined metabolism, intimate partnership with a haptophyte host, and broad distribution. Here, we explore the abiotic factors that govern UCYN-As presence at the San Pedro Ocean Time-series (SPOT), its partner fidelity, and statistical interactions with non-symbiotic eukaryotes. 16S and 18S rRNA sequences were amplified by \"universal primers\" from monthly samples and resolved into Amplicon Sequence Variants, allowing us to observe multiple UCYN-A symbioses. UCYN-A1 relative abundances increased following the 2015-2016 El Nino event. When this \"open ocean ecotype\" was present, coastal upwelling ceased, and Ekman transport brought tropical waters into the region. Network analyses reveal all strains of UCYN-A co-occur with dinoflagellates including Lepidodinium, a potential predator, and parasitic Syndiniales. UCYN-A2 appeared to pair with multiple hosts and was not tightly coupled to its predominate host, while UCYN-A1 maintained a strong host-symbiont relationship. These biological relationships are particularly important to study in the context of climate change, which will alter UCYN-A distribution patterns both locally and globally.",

Assisted by a network of citizen scientists across the United Kingdom, we show that 1 in 20 viable aerosolized spores of this mold are resistant to the agricultural fungicide tebuconazole and 1 in 140 spores are resistant to the four most used azoles for treating clinical aspergillosis infections. Season and proximity to industrial composters were associated with growth of A. fumigatus from air samples, but not with the presence of azole resistance, and hotspots were not stable between sampling periods suggesting a high degree of atmospheric mixing. Genomic analysis shows no distinction between those resistant genotypes found in the environment and in patients, indicating that ~40% (58/150 sequenced genomes) of azole-resistant A. fumigatus infections are acquired from environmental exposures. Due to the ubiquity of this measured exposure, it is crucial that we determine source(s) of azole-resistant A. fumigatus, who is at greatest risk of exposure and how to mitigate these exposures, in order to minimize treatment failure in patients with aspergillosis.\n\nOne sentence summaryUK-wide citizen science surveillance finds a ubiquitous exposure to aerosolized spores of a human fungal pathogen that have evolved in the environment cross-resistance to essential clinical antifungal drugs",

    "abstract": "Influenza outbreaks are associated with substantial morbidity, mortality and economic burden. Next generation antivirals are needed to treat seasonal infections and prepare against zoonotic spillover of avian influenza viruses with pandemic potential. Having previously identified oral efficacy of the nucleoside analog 4-Fluorouridine (4-FlU, EIDD-2749) against SARS-CoV-2 and respiratory syncytial virus, we explored activity of the compound against seasonal and highly pathogenic influenza (HPAI) viruses in cell culture, human airway epithelium organoids, and/or two animal models, ferrets and mice, that assess IAV transmission and lethal viral pneumonia, respectively. 4-FlU inhibited a panel of relevant influenza A and B viruses with nanomolar potency in organoids. In vitro polymerase assays revealed immediate chain termination of IAV polymerase after 4-FlU incorporation, in contrast to delayed chain termination of SARS-CoV-2 and RSV polymerase. Once-daily oral treatment of ferrets with 2 mg/kg 4-FlU initiated 12 hours after infection rapidly stopped virus shedding and prevented direct-contact transmission to untreated sentinels. Treatment of mice infected with a lethal inoculum of pandemic A/CA/07/2009 (H1N1)pdm09 (Ca09) with 2 mg/kg 4-FlU alleviated pneumonia. Three doses mediated complete survival when treatment was initiated up to 60 hours after infection, indicating an unusually broad window for effective intervention. Therapeutic oral 4-FlU ensured survival of animals infected with HPAI A/VN/12/2003 (H5N1) and of immunocompromised mice infected with pandemic Ca09. Recoverees were fully protected against homologous reinfection. This study defines the mechanistic foundation for high sensitivity of influenza viruses to 4-FlU and supports 4-FlU as developmental candidate for the treatment of seasonal and pandemic influenza.\n\nAuthor SummaryNext-generation antiviral therapeutics are needed to better mitigate seasonal influenza and prepare against zoonotic virus spillover from animal reservoirs. At greatest risk are the immunocompromised and patients infected with highly pathogenic influenza viruses. In this study, we have demonstrated efficacy of a broad-spectrum nucleoside analog, 4-fluorouridine, against a representative panel of influenza viruses in cell culture, human organoids, and two animal models, ferrets and mice. Acting as an immediate chain terminator of the influenza virus polymerase, once-daily oral treatment protected against lethal infection with seasonal and highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, prevented direct-contact transmission to untreated sentinels, and mitigated lethal infection of immunocompromised hosts. These results support the developmental potential of 4-fluorouridine for treatment of vulnerable patient groups and mitigation of pandemic influenza, providing a much-needed additional therapeutic option for improved disease management.",

    "abstract": "Over past years, long-range RNA structure has emerged as a factor that is fundamental to alternative splicing regulation. Since an increasing number of human disorders are now being associated with splicing defects, it is essential to develop methods that assess long-range RNA structure experimentally. RNA in situ conformation sequencing (RIC-seq) is the method that recapitulates RNA structure within physiological RNA-protein complexes. In this work, we juxtapose RIC-seq experiments conducted in eight human cell lines with pairs of conserved complementary regions (PCCRs) that were predicted in silico. We show statistically that RIC-seq support strongly correlates with PCCR properties such as equilibrium free energy, presence of compensatory substitutions, and occurrence of A-to-I RNA editing sites and forked eCLIP peaks. Based on these findings, we prioritize PCCRs according to their RIC-seq support and show experimentally using antisense nucleotides and minigene mutagenesis that PCCRs in two disease-associated genes, PHF20L1 and CASK, impact alternative splicing. In sum, we demonstrate how RIC-seq experiments can be used to discover functional long-range RNA structures, and particularly those that regulate alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "Growth differentiation factor 3 (GDF3) is a relatively understudied member of the TGF{beta} superfamily that is highly expressed during development. However, the function of GDF3 in adult biology is contentious. We use in vivo approaches to show that GDF3 loss-of-function in adipose tissue of obese adult mice causes reduced body weight and improved whole-body insulin sensitivity. These effects are accompanied by altered regulation of genes targeted by the TGF{beta} superfamily in vivo. Using in vitro approaches, we show that GDF3 can influence both arms of the TGF{beta} superfamily: GDF3 simultaneously inhibits BMP signaling and activates activin-like SMAD 2/3 signaling. We identify the type II receptors mediating this activity. GDF3 binds to the type II receptors BMPR2, ACTRIIA and ACTRIIB and achieves dose-dependent inhibition of multiple BMP proteins including BMP2, BMP7, BMP9, BMP10, and BMP15 in vitro. We also find that GDF3 activates TGF{beta}/activin-like SMAD2/3 signaling. Unbiased expression profiling confirms that GDF3 both attenuates BMP2-regulated gene expression and drives TGF{beta}/activin-like gene expression. Together these results provide much needed clarity to both the molecular pathways involved in GDF3 signaling and the physiological effects of GDF3 loss of function.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule array, assembled into the mitotic spindle, polymerises from the centrosomes and the chromosomes in many organisms. Their plus ends alternate between growing and shrinking. This dynamic instability plays a key role in pulling on the kinetochores to check the spindle assembly and correct the errors in chromosome attachments. In addition, the minus ends at centrosomes can undergo depolymerisation coordinated with the polymerisation of the plus ends at the kinetochores. Such a mechanism, among others, creates treadmilling, id est a net poleward movement of microtubules called poleward flux. This flux is involved in many roles, chromosome congression in prometaphase, chromosome misattachment detection and correction, spindle length maintenance in metaphase, and synchronous segregation of sister chromatids in anaphase. Interestingly, no poleward flux was measured in the Caenorhabditis elegans single-cell embryo, despite it is equipped with all homologous proteins involved in this mechanism in other organisms. To investigate this peculiarity, we labelled the microtubules and photobleached them in a rectangular region. Surprisingly, we observed that both edges of the bleached zone (fronts) move inwards, closing the dark area. However, the middle of the bleached zone does not move clearly, confirming the absence of a global poleward flow. The dynamics of the microtubules emanating from the centrosomes combined with the diffraction due to microscopy imaging account for the apparent movement of the front on the centrosome side. Therefore, we suggest no flux of the centrosome-anchored (spindle) microtubules. In contrast, on the chromosome side, we observed a front moving poleward, faster than the one on the other side, and dependent on proteins ensuring the attachment and growth of microtubules at kinetochores, NDC-80, CLS-2CLASP, and ZYG-9XMAP215. Besides, we found that the depletion of the depolymerase KLP-7MCAK does not impair this poleward recovery. Finally, the faster recovery is restricted to the spindle region close to the chromosomes. Therefore, we suggest that the kinetochore microtubules undergo a poleward flux, moving with respect to spindle microtubules. Because the kinetochore microtubules are shorter than the half-spindle, this flux is localised close to the chromosomes. Furthermore, it may not rely on treadmilling as KLP-7MCAK is dispensable. This spatially restricted flux found in the nematode may be related to the slow elongation of the spindle during metaphase and may buffer the strong pulling forces exerted by the cortical force generators at the spindle poles.",

In this study, we consider a mathematical model for stem cell proliferation in the shoot apical meristem (abbrev.

Stem cells in the SAM normally undergo asymmetric cell division and produce successor stem cells and differentiated cells. The differentiated cells proliferate and contribute to shoot elongation.\n\nOccasionally, a stem cell is replaced by a copy of an adjacent stem cell. We discuss the \"coalescent length\" between cells indicating their genetic difference with respect to neutral mutations. A mathematical analysis revealed the following. The genetic diversity of cells sampled at the same position along the shoot increases with the distance from the bottom of the shoot. Stem cells hold a larger variation if they are replaced only by the nearest neighbors than if they are replaced by any cells. The coalescent length between two cells increases not only with the difference in the position along the shoot but also in the angle around the shoot axis.

How the close proximity of nascent proteins to the ribosome influences their folding thermodynamics remains poorly understood.

This approach enables quantitative measurements sub-global folding stabilities of ribosome nascent chains (RNCs) within complex protein mixtures and extracts. To validate the methodology, we analyzed the folding thermodynamics of three model proteins (DHFR, CheY and DinB) in soluble and ribosome-bound states. The data indicated that the ribosome can significantly alter the stability of nascent polypeptides. Ribosome-induced stability modulations were highly variable among different folding domains and were dependent on localized charge distributions within nascent polypeptides. The results implicated electrostatic interactions between the ribosome surface and nascent polypeptides as the cause of ribosome-induced stability modulations. The study establishes a robust proteomic methodology for analyzing localized stabilities within ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides and sheds light on how the ribosome influences the thermodynamics of protein folding.",

Here, we show, for the first time, that STAT5 is activated in human podocytes in focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Additionally, Stat5 podocyte-specific inactivation aggravates the functional and structural alterations in a mouse model of FSGS. This could be due, at least in part, to an inhibition of the autophagic flux. Finally, Interleukin 15 (IL-15), a classical activator of STAT5 in immune cells, increases STAT5 phosphorylation in human podocytes and its administration alleviates glomerular injury in vivo by maintaining the autophagy flux in podocytes. In conclusion, activating podocytic STAT5 with commercially available IL-15 represents a new therapeutic avenue with the potential for FSGS.",

    "abstract": "Metabolism-disrupting chemicals (MDCs) are endocrine disruptors with obesogenic and/or diabetogenic action. There is mounting evidence linking exposure to MDCs to increased susceptibility to diabetes. Despite the important role of glucagon in glucose homeostasis, there is little information on the effects of MDCs on -cells. Furthermore, there are no methods to identify and test MDCs with the potential to alter -cell viability and function. Here we used the mouse -cell line TC1-9 to evaluate the effects of MDCs on cell viability and glucagon secretion. We tested six chemicals at concentrations within human exposure (from 0.1 pM to 1 M): bisphenol-A (BPA), tributyltin (TBT), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), triphenylphosphate (TPP), triclosan (TCS), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE). Using two different approaches, MTT assay and DNA-binding dyes, we observed that BPA and TBT decreased -cell viability via a mechanism that depends on the activation of estrogen receptors and PPAR{gamma}, respectively. These two chemicals induced ROS production, but barely altered the expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress markers. Although PFOA, TPP, TCS, and DDE did not alter cell viability nor induced ROS generation or ER stress, all four compounds negatively affected glucagon secretion. Our findings suggest that TC1-9 cells seem an appropriate model to test chemicals with metabolism-disrupting activity and that the improvement of the test methods proposed herein could be incorporated into protocols for the screening of diabetogenic MDCs.",

    "abstract": "Novel in vitro platforms based on human neurons are needed to improve early drug testing and address the stalling drug discovery in neurological disorders. Topologically controlled circuits of human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons have the potential to become such a testing system. In this work, we build in vitro co-cultured circuits of human iPSC-derived neurons and rat primary glial cells using microfabricated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) structures on microelectrode arrays (MEAs). Such circuits are created by seeding either dissociated cells or pre-aggregated spheroids at different neuron-to-glia ratios. Furthermore, an antifouling coating is developed to prevent axonal overgrowth in undesired locations of the microstructure. We assess the electrophysiological properties of different types of circuits over more than 50 days, including their stimulation-induced neural activity. Finally, we demonstrate the effect of magnesium chloride on the electrical activity of our iPSC circuits as a proof-of-concept for screening of neuroactive compounds.",

    "abstract": "The power of electrophysiologically measured cortical activity decays 1/fX. The slope of this decay (i.e. the spectral exponent) is modulated by various factors such as age, cognitive states or psychiatric/neurological disorders. Interestingly, a mostly parallel line of research has also uncovered similar effects for the spectral slope in the electrocardiogram (ECG). This raises the question whether these bodywide changes in spectral slopes are (in-)dependent. Focusing on well-established age-related changes in spectral slopes we analyzed a total of 1282 recordings of magnetoencephalography (MEG) resting state measurements with concurrent ECG in an age-diverse sample. We show that the aperiodic signal recorded using surface electrodes/sensors originates from multiple physiological sources. In particular, significant parts of age-related changes in aperiodic activity normally interpreted to be of neural origin can be explained by cardiac activity. Moreover, our results suggest that changes (flattening/steepening) of the spectral slope with age are dependent on the recording site and investigated frequency range. Our results highlight the complexity of aperiodic activity while raising concerns when interpreting aperiodic activity as \"cortical\" without considering physiological influences.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveHepatitis A virus (HAV) infections are considered not to trigger an innate immune response in vivo, in contrast to hepatitis C virus (HCV). This lack of immune induction has been imputed to strong immune counteraction by HAV proteases 3CD and 3ABC. We aimed at elucidating the mechanisms of innate immune induction and counteraction by HAV and HCV in vivo and in vitro.\n\nDesignuPA-SCID mice with humanized liver were infected with HAV and HCV. Hepatic cell culture models were used to assess HAV and HCV sensing by TLR3 and RIG-I/MDA5, respectively. Cleavage of the adaptor proteins TRIF and MAVS was analyzed by transient and stable expression of HAV and HCV proteases and virus infection.\n\nResultsWe detected similar levels of Interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) induction in hepatocytes of HAV and HCV infected human liver chimeric mice. In cell culture, HAV induced ISGs exclusively upon sensing by MDA5 and dependent on LGP2. TRIF and MAVS were only partially cleaved by HAV 3ABC and 3CD, not sufficiently to abrogate signalling. In contrast, HCV NS3-4A efficiently degraded MAVS, as previously reported, whereas TRIF was not cleaved.\n\nConclusionsHAV induces an innate immune response in hepatocytes via MDA5/LGP2, with limited control of both pathways by proteolytic cleavage. HCV activates TLR3 and lacks TRIF cleavage, suggesting that this pathway mainly contributes to HCV induced antiviral response in hepatocytes. Our results shed new light on induction and counteraction of innate immunity by HAV and HCV and their potential contribution to clearance and persistence.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDYO_ST_ABSWhat is already known on this topic?C_ST_ABS-- Despite sharing biological and molecular similarities, HAV infections are always cleared while HCV infections persist in most cases.\n-- In infected chimpanzees HAV does not trigger a strong innate immune response, as opposed to HCV. This has been imputed to the action of HAV proteases abrogating the signalling pathways.\n-- Physiological in vitro and in vivo models, based on human hepatocytes, to assess HAV and HCV mechanisms of induction and interference of innate immunity are still missing.\n\n\nWhat this study adds-- HAV induces an innate immune response in vitro and in vivo, in systems with intact signalling pathways and devoid of adaptive immunity.\n-- HAV 3ABC and 3CD proteases do not abolish the host innate immune response.\n-- HCV NS3-4A protease disrupts the RLRs pathways, but cannot cleave TRIF and has no impact on TLR3 response.\n\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policy-- This study offers a comprehensive, side-by-side investigation on HAV and HCV infections in physiological models which recapitulate a cytokine response in the human liver, and allows a precise assessment of the viral interference related to the function of the respective signalling pathways.\n-- Our results elucidate mechanisms, so far controversial or poorly investigated, thus contributing to our understanding of HAV clearance and HCV persistence.",

    "abstract": "Sustained neuroinflammation is a major contributor to the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers (AD) and Parkinsons (PD) diseases. Neuroinflammation, like other cellular processes, is affected by the circadian clock. Microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, act as major contributors to neuroinflammation and are under the influence of the circadian clock. Microglial responses such as activation, recruitment, and cytokine expression are rhythmic in their response to various stimuli. While the link between circadian rhythms and neuroinflammation is clear, significant gaps remain in our understanding of this complex relationship. To further our understanding of this relationship, we studied the interaction between the microglial circadian clock and the enzyme NADPH Oxidase Isoform 2 (NOX2), an enzyme essential for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in oxidative stress, an integral characteristic of neuroinflammation. We examined BV2 microglia over circadian time, demonstrating oscillations of the clock genes Per2 and Bmal1 and the NOX2 subunits gp91phox and p47phox. We discovered the BV2 microglial clock exerted significant control over NOX2 expression and that the inhibition of NOX2 enabled the microglia to retain a functional circadian clock while reducing levels of ROS and inflammatory cytokines. These trends were mirrored in mouse bone marrow-derived primary macrophages. Our findings indicate NOX2 plays a crucial role in the interaction between the circadian clock and the activation of microglia/macrophages into their pro-inflammatory state.",

Antifungal activity of LABs and their cell-free fermentates (CFSs) against several plant pathogenic fungi and oomycetes (fungi sensu lato), including Alternaria, Aspergillus Colletotrichum, Penicillium, Plenodomus and Phytophthora, was evaluated in vitro using the culture overlaying and the agar diffusion tests. Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) were determined. LABs showed antifungal activity against the fungi sensu lato tested. The most noticeable inhibitory activity was shown by isolates of L. plantarum and P. pentosaceus against Fusarium oxysporum, Colletotrichum species and Penicillium nordicum. Chemical analysis revealed CFSs contained acid lactic and variable quantities of 14 diverse phenolic acids and 26 volatile organic compounds (VOCs). No obvious correlation was found between the metabolic profile of LABs and their antifungal efficacy.

    "abstract": "Hypertension is associated with presence of vascular abnormalities, such as remodeling and rarefaction. These processes play an important role in cerebrovascular disease development, however, the mechanistic changes leading to these diseases are not well characterized. Using data-independent acquisition-based mass spectrometry analysis, we determined the protein changes in cerebral arteries in pre- and early-onset hypertension from the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR), a model that resembles essential hypertension. Our analysis identified 125 proteins with expression levels that were significantly up- or downregulated in 12-week old SHRs compared to normotensive Wistar Kyoto rats. Using an angiogenesis enrichment analysis, we identified a critical imbalance in angiogenic proteins, promoting an anti-angiogenic profile in cerebral arteries at the early-onset of hypertension. In a comparison to previously published data, we demonstrate that this angiogenic imbalance is not present in mesenteric and renal arteries from age-matched SHRs. Finally, we identified two proteins (Fbln5 and Cdh13), whose expression levels were critically altered in cerebral arteries compared to the other arterial beds. The observation of an angiogenic imbalance in cerebral arteries from the SHR reveals critical protein changes in the cerebrovasculature at the early-onset of hypertension and provides novel insight into the early pathology of cerebrovascular disease.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell (SC) differentiation and maintenance of resultant progeny underlie cell-turnover in many organs, but it is difficult to pinpoint the contribution of either process. In the pituitary, a central regulator of endocrine axes, adult SCs undergo activation following target organ ablation, providing a well-characterized paradigm to study an adaptative response in a multi-organ system. Here we used single cell technologies to characterize SC heterogeneity and mobilization together with lineage tracing. We show that SC differentiation occurs more frequently than thought previously. In adaptative conditions, differentiation increases and is more diverse than demonstrated by the lineage tracing experiments. Detailed examination of SC progeny suggests that maintenance of selected nascent cells underlies SC output, highlighting a trophic role for the microenvironment. Analyses of cell trajectories further predict pathways and potential new regulators. Our model provides a valuable system to study the influence of evolving states on the mechanisms of SC mobilization.\n\nTeaser: Pituitary stem cells are diverse and differentiate more than thought but only selected progeny persist according to need.",

In this study, we compare the defense mechanisms associated with PM resistance in interspecific crosses segregating for a single R locus from Muscadinia rotundifolia (Run1, Run1.2b, Run2.1, Run2.2), Vitis cinerea (Ren2), V. romanetii (Ren4D and Ren4U), and the interspecific hybrid Villard blanc (Ren3). By combining optical microscopy, visual scoring, and biomass estimation, we show that the eight R loci confer resistance by limiting infection at different stages. We assessed the defense mechanisms triggered in response to PM at 1 and 5 days post inoculation (dpi) via RNA sequencing. To account for the genetic differences between species, we developed for each accession a diploid synthetic reference transcriptome by incorporating into the PN40024 reference homozygous and heterozygous sequence variants and de novo assembled transcripts. Most of the R loci exhibited a higher number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with PM resistance at 1 dpi compared to 5 dpi, suggesting that PM resistance is mostly associated with an early transcriptional reprogramming. Comparison of the PM resistance-associated DEGs showed a limited overlap between pairs of R loci, and nearly half of the DEGs were specific to a single R locus. The largest overlap of PM resistance-associated DEGs was found between Ren3+, Ren4D+, and Ren4U+ genotypes at 1 dpi, and between Ren4U+ and Run1+ accessions at 5 dpi. The Ren3+, Ren4D+, and Ren4U+ were also found to have the highest number of R locus-specific DEGs in response to PM. Both shared and R locus-specific DEGs included genes from different defense-related categories, indicating that the presence of E. necator triggered distinct transcriptional responses in the eight R loci.",

This approach does not disrupt nanoparticle surfaces and leverages the programmability of DNA nanotechnology to control DNA presentation. We demonstrated this approach using a variety of nanoparticles, including polymeric micelles, polystyrene beads, gold nanoparticles, and superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 5-20 nm in diameter. DNA cage formation was confirmed through transmission electron microscopy (TEM), neutralization of zeta potential, and a series of fluorescence experiments. DNA cages present \"handle\" sequences that can be used for reversible target attachment or self-assembly. Handle functionality was verified in solution, at the solid-liquid interface, and inside fixed cells, corresponding to applications in biosensing, DNA microarrays, and erasable immunocytochemistry. These experiments demonstrate the versatility of the electrostatic DNA caging approach and provide a new pathway to nanoparticle modification with DNA that will empower further applications of these materials in medicine and materials science.",

    "abstract": "Condensation/dissolution has become a widely acknowledged biological macromolecular assembly phenomenon in subcellular compartmentalization. MARTINI force field offers a coarse-grained protein model with a resolution that preserves molecular details with an explicit (CG) solvent. Despite its relatively higher resolution, it can still achieve condensate formation in reasonable computing time with explicit solvent and ionic species. Therefore, it is highly desirable to tune this force field to be able to reproduce the experimentally observed properties of the condensate formation. In this work, we studied the condensate formation of the low-sequence complexity (LC) domain of FUsed in Sarcoma (FUS) protein using a MARTINI 3 force field by systematically modifying (increasing) the protein-water interaction strength and varying salt concentration. We found that the condensate formation is sensitive both to the protein-water interaction strength and the presence of salt. While the unmodified MARTINI force field yields a complete collapse of proteins into one dense phase (i.e., no dilute phase), we reported a range of modified protein-water interaction strength that is capable of capturing the experimentally found transfer free energy between dense and dilute phases. We also found that the condensates lose their spherical shape upon the addition of salt, especially when the protein-water interactions are weak. Inter-chain amino acid contact map analysis showed one explanation for this observation: the protein-protein contact fraction reduces as salt is added to systems (when the protein-water interactions are weak), consistent with electrostatic screening effects. This reduction might be responsible for the condensates becoming nonspherical upon the addition of salt by reducing the need for minimizing interfacial area. However, as the protein-water interactions become stronger to the extent that makes the transfer free energy agree well with experimentally observed transfer free energy, we found an increase in protein-protein contact fraction upon the addition of salt, consistent with the salting-out effects. Therefore, we concluded that there is an intricate balance between screening effects and salting-out effects upon the addition of salt and this balance is highly sensitive to the strength of protein-water interactions.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms underlying long-term sustained weight loss and glycemic normalization after obesity surgery include changes in gut hormone levels, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). We demonstrate that two peptide biased agonists (GEP44 and GEP12) of the GLP-1, neuropeptide Y1, and neuropeptide Y2 receptors (GLP-1R, Y1-R, and Y2-R, respectively) elicit Y1-R antagonist-controlled, GLP-1R-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion in both rat and human pancreatic islets, thus revealing the counteracting effects of Y1-R and GLP-1R agonism. These agonists also promote insulin-independent Y1-R-mediated glucose uptake in muscle tissue ex vivo and more profound reductions in food intake and body weight than liraglutide when administered to diet-induced obese rats. Our findings support a role for Y1-R signaling in glucoregulation and highlight the therapeutic potential of simultaneous receptor targeting to achieve long-term benefits for millions of patients.",

    "abstract": "Hallmark features of systolic heart failure are reduced contractility and impaired metabolic flexibility of the myocardium. Cardiomyocytes (CMs) with elevated deoxy ATP (dATP) via overexpression of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) enzyme robustly improve contractility. However, the effect of dATP elevation on cardiac metabolism is unknown. Here, we developed proteolysis-resistant versions of RNR and demonstrate that elevation of dATP/ATP to ~1% in CMs in a transgenic mouse (TgRRB) resulted in robust improvement of cardiac function. Pharmacological approaches showed that CMs with elevated dATP have greater basal respiratory rates by shifting myosin states to more active forms, independent of its isoform, in relaxed CMs. Targeted metabolomic profiling revealed a significant reprogramming towards oxidative phosphorylation in TgRRB-CMs. Higher cristae density and activity in the mitochondria of TgRRB-CMs improved respiratory capacity. Our results revealed a critical property of dATP to modulate myosin states to enhance contractility and induce metabolic flexibility to support improved function in CMs.\n\nHighlightsO_LIUbiquitylation-resistant variant RRB in a transgenic mice model (TgRRB) elevates dATP level up to 1% (of the total ATP pool) in the heart and improves function.\nC_LIO_LITgRRB-CMs show greater basal oxygen consumption due to changes in myosin state by dATP.\nC_LIO_LITgRRB-CMs respond to elevated function with a metabolic shift, such that there are higher pools of oxidative metabolites, with elevated OXPHOS, FAO, and energy reserve.\nC_LIO_LILong-term mitochondrial remodeling may occur to accommodate for the higher energy demands of the high functioning TgRRB-CMs.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/515235v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@179b857org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@357f7dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45221forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c32ca5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microbiota provide benefits to their hosts including nutrient uptake and protection against pathogens. How hosts balance an appropriate immune response to avoid microbiota overgrowth while avoiding autoimmunity is not well understood. Here we show that Arabidopsis pskr1 (phytosulfokine receptor 1) loss-of-function mutants display autoimmunity and reduced rhizosphere bacterial growth when inoculated with normally growth-promoting Pseudomonas fluorescens. Transcriptional profiling demonstrated that PSKR1 regulates the plant growth-defense trade-off during plant-microbiome interactions: PSKR1 upregulates plant photosynthesis and root growth but suppresses salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense responses. Genetic epistasis experiments showed that PSRK1 inhibition of microbiota-induced autoimmunity is fully dependent on SA signaling. Finally, using a transgenic reporter, we showed that P. fluorescens induces PSKR1 expression in roots, suggesting P. fluorescens might manipulate plant signaling to promote its colonization. Our data demonstrate a genetic mechanism to coordinate beneficial functions of the microbiome while preventing autoimmunity.",

    "abstract": "A ratiometric response gives an output that is proportional to the ratio between the magnitudes of two inputs. Ratio computation has been observed in nature and is also needed in the development of smart probiotics and organoids. Here, we achieve ratiometric gene expression response in bacteria E. coli with the incoherent merger network. In this network, one input molecule activates expression of the output protein while the other molecule activates an intermediate protein that enhances the outputs degradation. When degradation rate is first order and faster than dilution, the output responds linearly to the ratio between the input molecules levels over a wide range with R2 close to 1. Response sensitivity can be quantitatively tuned by varying the outputs translation rate. Furthermore, ratiometric responses are robust to global perturbations in cellular components that influence gene expression because such perturbations affect the output through an incoherent feedforward loop. This work demonstrates a new molecular signal processing mechanism for multiplexed sense-and-respond circuits that are robust to intra-cellular context.",

    "abstract": "The ability to measure the phenotype of millions of different genetic designs using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) has revolutionised our understanding of genotype-to-phenotype relationships and opened avenues for data-centric approaches to biological design. However, our knowledge of how best to design these costly experiments and the effect that our choices have on the quality of the data produced is lacking. Here, we tackle this issue by developing FORE-CAST, a Python package that supports the accurate simulation of cell-sorting and sequencing based MPRAs and robust maximum like-lihood based inference of genetic design function from MPRA data. We use FORECASTs capabilities to reveal rules for MPRA experimental design that help ensure accurate genotype-to-phenotype links and show how the simulation of MPRA experiments can help us better understand the limits of prediction accuracy when this data is used for training deep learning based classifiers. As the scale and scope of MPRAs grows, tools like FORECAST will help ensure we make informed decisions during their development and the most of the data produced.",

Nevertheless, in NF1 patients, they can cover a significant proportion of the body, with some individuals developing hundreds to thousands of lesions. cNFs can cause pain, itching, and disfigurement with substantial socio-emotional repercussions. To date, surgical removal or laser desiccation are the only treatment options, but can result in scarring and the leave a potential for regrowth.\n\nTo support drug discovery efforts focused on identifying effective systemic therapies for cNF, we introduce an approach to routinely establish and screen cNF tumor organoids. We optimized conditions to support ex vivo growth of genomically-diverse cNFs. Patient-derived cNF organoids closely recapitulate the molecular and cellular heterogeneity of these tumors as measured by immunohistopathology, DNA methylation, RNA-seq and flow cytometry. Our tractable patient-derived cNF organoid platform enables rapid screening of hundreds of compounds in a patient- and tumor-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "Age-related loss of intestinal barrier function has been found across species, and the causes remain unknown. The intestinal epithelial barrier is maintained by tight junctions (TJs) in mammals and septate junctions (SJs) in insects. Specialized tricellular junctions (TCJs) are found at the nexus of three adjacent cell membranes, and we showed previously that aging results in mis-localization of the tricellular SJ (tSJ) component Gliotactin (Gli) in enterocytes (ECs) of the Drosophila melanogaster intestine. In embryonic epithelia, the tSJ protein Bark beetle (Bark) recruits Gli to tSJs, which prompted us to investigate Bark function in the intestine. Bark protein localization decreases at tSJs in aged flies. EC-specific bark depletion in young flies led to hallmarks of intestinal aging and shortened lifespan, whereas depletion of bark in progenitor cells reduced Notch activity, biasing differentiation toward the secretory lineage. Together, our data implicate Bark in EC maturation, maintenance of intestinal barrier integrity, and homeostasis. Understanding the assembly and maintenance of tSJs to ensure barrier integrity may lead to strategies to improve tissue integrity when function is compromised.",

Their role in the virulence of protist pathogens like Plasmodium falciparum makes them an intriguing target for structural and functional studies. Here, we show the first structure of a K+-independent M-PPase, asymmetric and time-dependent substrate binding in time-resolved structures of a K+-dependent M-PPase, and demonstrate pumping-before-hydrolysis by electrometric studies. We suggest how key residues in helix 12, 13, and the exit channel loops affect ion selectivity and K+-activation due to a complex interplay of residues that are involved in subunit-subunit communication. Our findings not only explain ion selectivity in M-PPases but also why they display half-of-the-sites reactivity. Based on this we propose, for the first time, a unified and testable model for ion pumping, hydrolysis, and energy-coupling in all M-PPases, including those that pump both Na+ and H+.",
