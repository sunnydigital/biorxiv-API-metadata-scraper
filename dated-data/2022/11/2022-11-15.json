    "abstract": "Molecular dynamics simulations have been widely used to study solute permeation across biological membranes. The potential of mean force (PMF) for solute permeation is typically computed using enhanced sampling techniques such as umbrella sampling (US). For bulky drug-like permeants, however, obtaining converged PMFs remains challenging and often requires long simulation times, resulting in an unacceptable computational cost. Here, we augmented US with simulated tempering, introducing Simulated Tempering-enhanced US (STeUS), to improve the convergence of PMF calculations for the permeation of methanol and three common drug molecules. Simulate tempering helps to enhance sampling by varying the temperature of the system along a pre-defined temperature ladder. To obtain sufficient sampling of the umbrella histograms, which were computed only from the ground temperature, we modified the simulation time fraction spent at the ground temperature between 1/K and 50%, where K is the number of ST temperature states. We found that STeUS accelerates convergence compared to standard US, and the benefit of STeUS is system-dependent. For bulky molecules, for which standard US poorly converged, the application of ST was highly successful, leading to a more than five-fold accelerated convergence of the PMFs. For the small methanol solute, for which conventional US converges moderately, the application of ST is only beneficial if 50% of the STeUS simulation time is spent at the ground temperature. This study establishes STeUS as an efficient and simple method for PMF calculations, thereby strongly reducing the computational cost of routine high-throughput studies of drug permeability.",

    "abstract": "Male crickets attract females by producing calls with their forewings. Louder calls travel further and are more effective at attracting mates. However, crickets are small, and therefore inefficient, dipole sound-sources. Only a small group called tree crickets make acoustic tools called baffles which reduce acoustic short-circuiting, a source of dipole inefficiency. Here, we ask why baffling is uncommon among crickets. We hypothesize that baffling may be rare, because like other tools they offer insufficient advantage for most species. To test this, we modelled the calling efficiencies of crickets within the full space of possible natural wing sizes and call frequencies, in multiple acoustic environments. We then generated efficiency landscapes, within which we plotted the positions of 111 cricket species across 7 phylogenetic clades. We found that all sampled crickets, in all conditions, could gain efficiency from tool use. Surprisingly, however, we also found that calling from the ground significantly increased efficiency, with or without a baffle, by as much as an order of magnitude. We found that the ground provides some reduction of acoustic short-circuiting but also halves the air volume within which sound is radiated. It simultaneously reflects sound upwards, allowing recapture of a significant amount of acoustic energy through constructive interference. Thus, using the ground as a reflective baffle is a very effective strategy for increasing calling efficiency. Indeed, theory suggests that this increase in efficiency is accessible not just to crickets, but to all acoustically communicating animals whether they are dipole or monopole sound sources.\n\nSignificance StatementLoudness is a crucial functional feature of calls in acoustically communicating animals. Animals attempting to reach prospective mates or ward off predators are expected to make themselves as loud as possible. Given the importance of loudness, there are two long-standing, seemingly unrelated paradoxes in acoustic communication. The first is the rarity of acoustic tool use. The second is the high number of animals that call from reflective surfaces, like the ground, known be an impediment to sound propagation. We resolve both paradoxes and show them to be related. By refocusing analysis from sound propagation to sound radiation, we show that the ground is the opposite of an impediment and can, in fact, boost sound loudness more than tool use. Thus, we show that calling from a reflective surface is an alternative strategy for maximizing call loudness, and one that is available to all animals.",

    "abstract": "Invasion of the surrounding tissue is a key aspect of cancer growth and spread involving a coordinated effort between cell migration and matrix degradation, and has been the subject of mathematical modelling for almost 30 years. In this current paper we address a long-standing question in the field of cancer cell migration modelling. Namely, identify the migratory pattern and spread of individual cancer cells, or small clusters of cancer cells, when the macroscopic evolution of the cancer cell colony is dictated by a specific partial differential equation (PDE).\n\nWe show that the usual heuristic understanding of the diffusion and advection terms of the PDE being one-to-one responsible for the random and biased motion of the solitary cancer cells, respectively, is not precise. On the contrary, we show that the drift term of the correct stochastic differential equation (SDE) scheme that dictates the individual cancer cell migration, should account also for the divergence of the diffusion of the PDE. We support our claims with a number of numerical experiments and computational simulations.",

    "abstract": "Macroautophagy is a highly adaptable degradative system that is essential for life. Although studies have shown the importance of this pathway across all organ systems, we have little understanding of how discrete tissues might employ autophagy and how this changes during stress. Using an approach to identify quantitatively autophagic cargoes, we sought to identify how cells from the adult liver and brain rely on autophagy under basal conditions and during nutrient deprivation. We find that in addition to the turnover of cell type specific proteins, the different organs relied on autophagy differentially for the turnover of organelles such as mitochondria, peroxisomes and ER. Moreover, in response to nutrient deprivation, although both tissues showed increased cargo capture, cell type- and tissue-specific patterns emerged. Most notably in the brain, we found an increased representation of glial and endothelial cell cargoes, whereas neuronal cargoes were relatively unchanged. In liver, we unexpectedly found a decreased representation of mitochondrial proteins, which represented a shift moving away from the whole mitochondrion turnover to piecemeal. These results indicate how the physiologic context of the different cell types significantly influence autophagy-dependence, and begins to shed insight into how the term  autophagy dysfunction might be thought of when considering different disease states.",

    "abstract": "The Nuclear Receptor (NR) superfamily includes phylogenetically related ligand-activated proteins, which play a key role in various cellular activities. NR proteins are subdivided into seven subfamilies based on their function, mechanism, and nature of the interacting ligand. Developing robust tools to identify NR could give insights into their functional relationships and involvement in disease pathways. Existing NR prediction tools only use a few types of sequence-based features and are tested on relatively similar independent datasets; thus, they may suffer from overfitting when extended to new genera of sequences. To address this problem, we developed Nuclear Receptor Prediction Tool (NRPreTo); a two-level NR prediction tool with a unique training approach where in addition to the sequence-based features used by existing NR prediction tools, six additional feature groups depicting various physiochemical, structural and evolutionary features of proteins were utilized. The first level of NRPreTo allows for the successful prediction of a query protein as NR or non-NR, and further subclassifies the protein into one of the seven NR subfamilies in the second level. We developed Random Forest classifiers to test on benchmark datasets, as well as the entire human protein datasets from RefSeq and Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD). We observed that using additional feature groups improved performance. We also observed that NRPreTo achieved high performance on the external datasets and predicted 59 novel NRs in the human proteome.

In addition, we characterized the carbohydrate-active and methanogenic potential of the zoo-housed gorilla microbiome through shotgun metagenomics and RNA sequencing. The zoo-housed gorilla microbiota showed increased alpha diversity in terms of bacterial species richness and a distinct composition from that of the wild gorilla microbiota, including a loss of abundant fiber-degrading and hydrogenic Chloroflexi. Metagenomic analysis of the CAZyome indicated predominant oligosaccharide-degrading activity, while RNA sequencing revealed diverse cellulase and hemi-cellulase activities in the zoo-housed gorilla gut, contributing to a total of 268 identified carbohydrate-active enzymes. Metatranscriptome analysis revealed a substantial contribution of 38% of the transcripts from anaerobic fungi and archaea to the gorilla microbiome. This activity originates from cellulose-degrading and hydrogenic fungal species belonging to the class Neocallimastigomycetes, as well as from methylotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea belonging to the classes Thermoplasmata and Methanobacteria, respectively. Our study shows the added value of RNA sequencing in a multiomics approach and highlights the contribution of eukaryotic and archaeal activities to the gut microbiome of gorillas.",

    "abstract": "The Arctic is warming at an alarming rate. While changes in plant community composition and phenology have been extensively reported, the effects of climate change on reproduction remain poorly understood. We quantified multidecadal changes in flower density for nine tundra plant species at a low- and a high-arctic site in Greenland. We found substantial changes in flower density over time, but the temporal trends and drivers of flower density differed both between species and sites. Total flower density increased over time at the low-arctic site, whereas the high-arctic site showed no directional change. Within and between sites, the direction and rate of change differed among species, with varying effects of summer temperature, the temperature of the previous autumn and the timing of snowmelt. Finally, all species showed a strong trade-off in flower densities between successive years, suggesting an effective cost of reproduction. Overall, our results reveal region-and taxon-specific variation in the sensitivity and responses of co-occurring species to shared climatic drivers, and a clear cost of reproductive investment among arctic plants. The ultimate effects of further changes in climate may thus be decoupled between species and across space, with critical knock-on effects on plant species dynamics, food web structure and overall ecosystem functioning.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide association studies revealed a robust association between genetic variants in the LIPA (lysosomal acid lipase) gene and coronary artery diseases (CAD), but not lipid traits. QTL studies support that the risk alleles of LIPA CAD variants are associated with higher LIPA mRNA and enzyme activity in human monocytes. Yet the variant-to-function relationship and how this important locus impacts disease etiology has not been fully established. Herein, we aim to determine the causal variant(s), involved cell type, and the target gene, establish the causality of the variant-to-function relationship, and elucidate how increased myeloid LIPA impacts atherosclerosis in vivo.\n\nMethodsWe apply functional genomic datasets, post-GWAS prioritization pipelines, and molecular biology techniques, incuding eQTL, enzyme activity-QTL, high-resolution Tri-HiC, ChIP-seq, and site-directed mutagenesis and luciferase assay to connect functional variants to the candidate genes in the causal cell type. To establish how increased myeloid LIPA impacts atherosclerosis, we generated myeloid-specific Lipa overexpression mice (LipaTg).\n\nResultsPost-GWAS pipelines support LIPA as the candidate causal gene at the locus. In human monocyte-derived macrophages, LIPA mRNA, protein and enzyme activity were higher in the risk allele carriers of CAD variants. High-resolution Tri-HiC and luciferase assay confirmed an intronic enhancer region showing strong interaction with the LIPA promoter. Within the enhancer region, the risk alleles of rs1412444/rs1412445 and rs1320496 demonstrate enhanced binding to PU. 1, and acted as the functional variants with risk alleles leading to increased enhancer activity. The risk allele of rs1320496 is predicted to create a motif binding site for PU.1. The functional genomic data together support that LIPA is the candidate causal gene in the locus, and the risk alleles of CAD led to increased LIPA in a myeloid cell-specific manner. Consistently, mice with myeloid-specific Lipa overexpression on a Ldlr-/- background showed significantly increased atherosclerotic lesion size and lesion macrophage area without affecting plasma cholesterol. ScRNA-seq analysis showed that LipaTg led to reduced lipid-enriched yet increased inflammatory macrophage subsets, and activation chemokine signaling pathway. This was further confirmed by reduced neutral lipid accumulation in both plaque and peritoneal macrophages and significantly increased monocytes infiltration into the lesion in LipaTg mice.\n\nConclusionsWe established that LIPA risk alleles drive increased myeloid LIPA and aggravate atherosclerosis.\n\nCLINICAL PERSPECTIVEO_ST_ABSWhat is New?C_ST_ABSO_LICAD GWAS variants at the LIPA locus led to increased macrophage LIPA expression and enzyme activity.\nC_LIO_LIMyeloid-specific overexpression of Lipa exacerbates atherosclerosis.\nC_LIO_LIOur study connected the genetic variation to the involved cell type and the target gene, and the disease mechanism for this important locus.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the Clinical Implications?O_LIGWAS and meta-analyses have identified over 200 loci for CAD.

By leveraging functional genomic studies and transgenic mice, our work established the direct causality that LIPA risk alleles drive increased myeloid LIPA and aggravate atherosclerosis. Establishing the variant-to-function relationship for this locus informs that increasing myeloid LIPA may not be a therapeutic strategy for CAD, despite the essential role of LIPA in regulating lysosomal lipid metabolism.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Early-stage lung adenocarcinoma is typically treated by surgical resection of the tumor. While in the majority of cases surgery can lead to cure, approximately 30% of patients progress. Despite intense efforts to map the genetic landscape of early-stage lung tumors, there has been limited success in discovering accurate biomarkers that can predict clinical outcomes. Meanwhile, the role of the tumor-adjacent tissue in cancer progression has been largely ignored. To test whether tumor-adjacent tissue can be informative of progression-free survival and to probe the underlying molecular pathways involved, we designed a multi-omic study in both tumor and matched tumor-adjacent histologically normal lung tissue from the same patient. Our study includes 143 treatment naive stage I cases with long-term patient follow-up and is, to our knowledge, the largest such study with the longest follow-up. We performed a comprehensive histologic characterization of all tumors, mapped the mutational landscape and probed the transcriptome of both tumor and adjacent normal tissue. We evaluated the predictive power of each data modality and showed that the transcriptome of tumor-adjacent histologically normal lung tissue is the only reliable predictor of clinical outcome. Unbiased discovery of co-expressed gene modules revealed that inflammatory pathways are upregulated in the tumor-adjacent tissue of patients at high risk for disease progression. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptome analysis in the tumor-adjacent lung demonstrated that progression-associated inflammatory signatures were broadly expressed by both immune and non-immune cells including mesothelial cells, alveolar type 2 cells and fibroblasts, CD1 dendritic cells and MAST cells. Collectively, our studies suggest that molecular profiling of tumor-adjacent tissue can identify patients that are at high risk for disease progression.",

We found that both LPS and Bacillus significantly accelerate the growth of colorectal cancer cells. These results show that the increased presence of certain bacteria can promote cancer cell growth and that these microfluidic chips can be used to test the specific correlation between bacteria and cancer cell growth.

    "abstract": "Mycotoxins are extremely dangerous, and their detection in our environment, food and feed is becoming increasingly important. Biosensors are being implemented heavily in mycotoxin detection along with other significant applications. Aptamers have numerous beneficial advantages as biorecognition molecules and are being used as the biorecognition part of biosensors (Aptasensors). The development of aptamers does not require inducing immune response against the target, but the SELEX method is used. The SELEX method is laborious, time consuming and can be expensive at times. Various efforts were done to replace that method with a computational alternative to reduce the effort, time and money needed to develop and design aptamers. One of the most significant efforts to achieve that was the MAWS algorithm. We used the MAWS algorithm to develop a new aptamer against aflatoxin B1, the most dangerous mycotoxin. The MAWS algorithm failed to function properly, and molecular modelling and molecular docking was used alternatively to achieve the same goal. A new pipeline for predicting ssDNA aptamers was proposed, a new aptamer against aflatoxin B1 was obtained and recommendations for further future research directions were given.",

    "abstract": "With the growing complexity of single-cell and spatial genomics data, there is an increasing importance of unbiased and efficient exploratory data analysis tools. One common exploratory data analysis step is the prediction of genes with different levels of activity in a subset of cells or locations inside a tissue. We previously developed singleCellHaystack, a method for predicting differentially expressed genes from single-cell transcriptome data, without relying on clustering of cells. Here we present an update to singleCellHaystack, which is now a universally applicable method for predicting differentially active features: 1) singleCellHaystack now accepts continuous features that can be RNA or protein expression, chromatin accessibility or module scores from single-cell, spatial and even bulk genomics data, and 2) it can handle 1D trajectories, 2-3D spatial coordinates, as well as higher-dimensional latent spaces as input coordinates. Performance has been drastically improved, with up to ten times reduction in computational time and scalability to millions of cells, making singleCellHaystack a suitable tool for exploratory analysis of atlas level datasets. singleCellHaystack is available as an R package and Python module",

    "abstract": "Phenology is defined as the observation of biological events or life cycle phases that occur due to changes in climate and season. Primarily, phenology of all organisms is influenced by temperature fluctuations and quick climate changes which in turn regulate a variety of environmental factors. When discussing about the effects of climate change on ecosystems, phenology is especially important as many animals depend on the phenology of plants for their survival. Analysing the phenological patterns of a particular area can provide us with critical points on how ecosystems are affected by climate change. In this study, we have analysed the patterns of phenology for several trees and tried to identify any idiosyncrasies which may arise as a result of climate change and other similar factors. A total of 75 individuals belonging to 15 genera or 17 species were documented in Socorro plateau, Goa and their phenological patterns such as flowering, fruiting and leaf cover were recorded and analysed. The phenological patterns of the individual trees were compared in relation to each other such as in-between flowering and fruiting of the same species. In addition to this, the species were compared with each other in terms of their rate of flowering/fruiting to observe their inter-connected variations. Prospects for future research were identified to further promote studies in conservation biology of flora and fauna in the area and in climate change to mediate its effects.",

    "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease is linked to impaired cognitive function and increased neurovascular disease risk even after correction for classical risk factors. The mechanism(s) underlying these links are unclear but may involve interactions of uraemic toxins with the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we studied how the major uraemic toxin p-cresol sulfate (pCS) could affect BBB integrity. Exposure of human hCMEC/D3 endothelial cells to pCS dose-dependently increased paracellular permeability and disrupted intercellular tight junctions, a permeabilising effect mirrored in mice. Whole brain RNAseq analysis identified pCS-mediated suppression of neuronal activity, transcription and mitochondrial respiration pathways. In vitro studies identified pCS binding to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), leading via annexin A1 and STAT3 signalling to mobilisation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2/9. Confirming this pathway in vivo, the BBB damaging effects of pCS were prevented by pre-treatment with the EGFR antagonist erlotinib or the MMP2/9 inhibitor SB-3CT. Finally, hCMEC/D3 cells exposed to haemodialysis patient serum, but not to that of healthy donors, showed an erlotinib-sensitive increase in paracellular permeability that closely correlated in size to the total serum pCS content. Overall, we define a pathway linking the uraemic toxin pCS with BBB damage suggesting that targeting the EGFR may be useful in mitigating against cerebrovascular damage in chronic kidney disease.\n\nTranslational StatementPatients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased risk of cognitive impairment and stroke, pathologies associated cerebromicrovascular disease, but it is not clear why. Here, we show that the uraemic toxin p-cresol sulfate impairs BBB function in vitro and in vivo through EGFR-dependent MMP mobilisation. Importantly, serum from haemodialysis patients can also impair permeability of an in vitro BBB model, an effect prevented by EGFR inhibition, and proportional in magnitude to serum pCS content. Our data suggest that existing EGFR inhibitory drugs might have utility in preventing cerebral small vessel disease in CKD patients.",

    "abstract": "Microbiomes interact dynamically with their environment to perform exploitable functions such as production of valuable metabolites and degradation of toxic metabolites for a wide range of applications in human health, agriculture, and environmental cleanup. Developing computational models to predict the key bacterial species and environmental factors to build and optimize such functions are crucial to accelerate microbial community engineering. However, there is an unknown web of interactions that determine the highly complex and dynamic behaviors of these systems, which precludes the development of models based on known mechanisms. By contrast, entirely data-driven machine learning models can produce physically unrealistic predictions and often require significant amounts of experimental data to learn system behavior. We develop a physically constrained recurrent neural network that preserves model flexibility but is constrained to produce physically consistent predictions and show that it outperforms existing machine learning methods in the prediction of experimentally measured species abundance and metabolite concentrations. Further, we present an experimental design algorithm to select a set of experimental conditions that simultaneously maximize the expected gain in information and target microbial community functions. Using a bioreactor case study, we demonstrate how the proposed framework can be used to efficiently navigate a large design space to identify optimal operating conditions. The proposed methodology offers a flexible machine learning approach specifically tailored to optimize microbiome target functions through the sequential design of informative experiments that seek to explore and exploit community functions.\n\n1 Author summaryThe functions performed by microbiomes hold tremendous promise to address grand challenges facing society ranging from improving human health to promoting plant growth. To design their properties, flexible computational models that can predict the temporally changing behaviors of microbiomes in response to key environmental parameters are needed. When considering bottom-up design of microbiomes, the number of possible communities grows exponentially with the number of organisms and environmental factors, which makes it challenging to navigate the microbiome function landscape. To overcome these challenges, we present a physically constrained machine learning model for microbiomes and a Bayesian experimental design framework to efficiently navigate the space of possible communities and environmental factors.",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are central platforms for not only the degradation of macromolecules but also the integration of multiple signaling pathways. However, whether and how lysosomes mediate the mitochondrial stress response (MSR) remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that lysosomal acidification via the vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase) is essential for the transcriptional activation of the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt). Mitochondrial stress stimulates v-ATPase-mediated lysosomal activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which then directly phosphorylates the MSR transcription factor, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Disruption of mTORC1-dependent ATF4 phosphorylation blocks the UPRmt, but not other similar stress responses, such as the UPRER. Finally, ATF4 phosphorylation downstream of the v-ATPase/mTORC1 signaling is indispensable for sustaining mitochondrial redox homeostasis and protecting cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated cell death upon mitochondrial stress. Thus, v-ATPase/mTORC1-mediated ATF4 phosphorylation via lysosomes links mitochondrial stress to UPRmt activation and mitochondrial function resilience.",

    "abstract": "The actin-rich cortex plays a fundamental role in many cellular processes. Its architecture and molecular composition vary across cell types and physiological states. The full complement of actin assembly factors driving cortex formation and how their activities are spatiotemporally regulated remain to be fully elucidated. Using Dictyostelium as a model for polarized and rapidly migrating cells, we show that GxcM, a RhoGEF localized specifically in the rear of migrating cells, functions together with F-BAR protein Fbp17, a small GTPase RacC, and the actin nucleation-promoting factor WASP to coordinately promote Arp2/3 complex-mediated cortical actin assembly. Over-activation of this signaling cascade leads to excessive actin polymerization in the rear cortex, whereas its disruption causes defects in cortical integrity and function. Therefore, different from its well-defined role in the formation of the front protrusions, the Arp2/3 complex-based actin carries out a previously unappreciated function in building the rear cortical subcompartment in rapidly migrating cells.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin is an essential component of nuclear mechanical response and shape that maintains nuclear compartmentalization and function. The biophysical properties of chromatin alter nuclear shape and stability, but little is known about whether or how major genomic functions can impact the integrity of the nucleus. We hypothesized that transcription might affect cell nuclear shape and rupture through its effects on chromatin structure and dynamics. To test this idea, we inhibited transcription with the RNA polymerase II inhibitor alpha-amanitin in wild type cells and perturbed cells that present increased nuclear blebbing. Transcription inhibition suppresses nuclear blebbing for several cell types, nuclear perturbations, and transcription inhibitors. Furthermore, transcription is necessary for robust nuclear bleb formation, bleb stabilization, and bleb-based nuclear ruptures. These morphological effects appear to occur through a novel biophysical pathway, since transcription does not alter either chromatin histone modification state or nuclear rigidity, which typically control nuclear blebbing. We find that active/phosphorylated RNA pol II Ser5, marking transcription initiation, is enriched in nuclear blebs relative to DNA. Thus, transcription initiation is a hallmark of nuclear blebs. Polymer simulations suggest that motor activity within chromatin, such as that of RNA pol II, can generate active forces that deform the nuclear periphery, and that nuclear deformations depend on motor dynamics. Our data provide evidence that the genomic function of transcription impacts nuclear shape stability, and suggests a novel mechanism, separate and distinct from chromatin rigidity, for regulating large-scale nuclear shape and function.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have long been viewed as a promising therapeutic for musculoskeletal repair. However, regulatory concerns including tumorgenicity, inconsistencies in preparation techniques, donor-to-donor variability, and the accumulation of senescence during culture expansion have hindered the clinical application of MSCs. Senescence, in particular, is a driving mechanism for MSC dysfunction with advancing age. Often characterized by increased reactive oxygen species, senescence-associated heterochromatin foci, inflammatory cytokine and chemokine secretion, and reduced proliferative capacity, senescence directly inhibits MSCs efficacy as a therapeutic for musculoskeletal regeneration and repair. Furthermore, autologous delivery of senescent MSCs can further induce disease and aging progression through the secretion of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and mitigate the regenerative potentetial of MSCs. To combat these issues, the use of senolytic agents to selectively clear senescent cell populations has become popular. However, their benefits to human MSCs during the culture expansion process have not yet been elucidated. To address this, analyzed markers of senescence during culturing of human primary adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs), a population of fat-resident MSCs commonly used in regenerative medicine applications. Next, we used the senolytic agent fisetin to determine if we can reduce these markers of senescence within our culture-expanded ADSC populations. Our results indicate that ADSCs acquire common markers of cellular senescence including increased reactive oxygen species, senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase, and senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Furthermore, we found that the senolytic agent fisetin works in a dose-dependent manner and selectively attenuates these markers of senescence while maintaining the differentiation potential of the expanded ADSCs.\n\nSignficance StatementThe accumulation of dysfunctional, senescent cells throughout aging is not confined to specific tissues and cell types, but instead effects the whole body, including stem cells. Similarly, during culture expansion stem cells accumulate senescence while concurrently losing their regenerative potential. In this study, we found that fisetin (a well known senotherapeutic agent) can reduce the number of senescent cells during stem cell expansion. The current results indicate that fisetin may be used not only as a promising therapeutic to remove senescent cells in stem cell isolates from older individuals but also to reduce the accumulation of senescence during culture expansion.",

We generated loss-of-function mouse mutants of Pol I subunits, Polr1a, Polr1b, Polr1c and Polr1d, thereby genetically inhibiting rRNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis. Pol I mutant embryos are preimplantation lethal and have fewer nucleoli. Using hiPSCs triple labeled for the three nucleolar compartments, we observe two phenotypes upon Pol I inhibition: a single condensed nucleolus, and fragmented nucleoli. We find that when rRNA transcription is inhibited, the viscosity of the granular compartment of the nucleolus is increased disrupting its liquid-liquid phase separation properties, which results in a condensed nucleolus.

    "abstract": "Cell therapy is a potential treatment for cystic fibrosis (CF). However, cell engraftment into the airway epithelium is challenging. Here, we model cell engraftment in vitro using the air-liquid interface (ALI) culture system by injuring well-differentiated CF ALI cultures and delivering non-CF cells at the time of peak injury. Engraftment efficiency was quantified by measuring chimerism by droplet digital PCR and functional ion transport in Ussing chambers. Using this model, we found that human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) engraft more efficiently when they are cultured by conditionally reprogrammed cell (CRC) culture methods. Cell engraftment into the airway epithelium requires airway injury, but the extent of injury needed is unknown. We compared three injury models and determined that severe injury with partial epithelial denudation facilitates long-term cell engraftment and functional CFTR recovery up to 20% of wildtype function. The airway epithelium promptly regenerates in response to injury, creating competition for space and posing a barrier to effective engraftment. We examined competition dynamics by time-lapse confocal imaging and found that delivered cells accelerate airway regeneration by incorporating into the epithelium. Irradiating the repairing epithelium granted engrafting cells a competitive advantage by diminishing resident stem cell proliferation. Intentionally causing severe injury to the lungs of people with CF would be dangerous. However, naturally occurring events like viral infection can induce similar epithelial damage with patches of denuded epithelium. We found that viral preconditioning promoted effective engraftment of cells primed for viral resistance.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria interact with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) at structurally and functionally specialized membrane contact sites known as mitochondria-ER contact sites (MERCs). MERCs are crucial for a myriad of physiological functions including lipid synthesis and transport, and calcium signaling. Alterations in the structure, composition or regulation of MERCs contribute to the aetiology of many pathologies including neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases. The proteins mediating the formation of MERCs have been extensively studied in yeast, where the ER-mitochondria encounter structure (ERMES) complex mediates the transport of lipids between the ER and mitochondria via three lipid binding SMP-domain proteins. However, none of the SMP proteins of the ERMES complex have orthologues in mammals suggesting that alternate pathways have evolved in metazoans. Combining proximity labelling (BioID), confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation, we found that the ER resident SMP-domain containing protein ESYT1 was enriched at MERCs, where it forms a complex with the outer mitochondrial membrane protein SYNJ2BP. The deletion of ESYT1 or SYNJ2BP reduced the number and length of MERCs, indicating that the ESYT1-SYN2JBP complex plays a role in tethering ER and mitochondria. Loss of this complex impaired ER to mitochondria calcium flux and provoked a significant alteration of the mitochondrial lipidome, most prominently a reduction of cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamines. Both phenotypes were rescued by re-expression of wild-type ESYT1 as well as an artificial mitochondria-ER tether. Together, these results reveal a novel function of ESYT1 in mitochondrial and cellular homeostasis through its role in the regulation of MERCs.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-arrestin plays a key role in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling and desensitization. Despite recent structural advances, the mechanisms that govern receptor-{beta}-arrestin interactions at the plasma membrane of living cells remain elusive. Here, we combine single-molecule microscopy with molecular dynamics simulations to dissect the complex sequence of events involved in {beta}-arrestin interactions with both receptors and the lipid bilayer. In contrast to the currently widely accepted model, we show that {beta}-arrestin spontaneously inserts into the lipid bilayer and transiently interacts with receptors via lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane. Moreover, we show that following receptor interaction, the plasma membrane stabilizes {beta}-arrestin in a membrane-bound, active-like conformation, allowing it to diffuse to clathrin coated pits separately from the activating receptor. These results challenge our current understanding of {beta}-arrestin function at the plasma membrane, revealing a new critical role for {beta}-arrestin pre-association with the lipid bilayer in facilitating its interactions with receptors and subsequent activation.",

    "abstract": "After myocardial infarction in the adult heart the remaining, non-infarcted tissue adapts to compensate the loss of functional tissue. This adaptation requires changes in gene expression networks, which are mostly controlled by transcription regulating proteins. Long non-coding transcripts (lncRNAs) are now recognized for taking part in fine-tuning such gene programs. We identified and characterized the cardiomyocyte specific lncRNA Sweetheart RNA (Swhtr), an approximately 10 kb long transcript divergently expressed from the cardiac core transcription factor coding gene Nkx2-5. We show that Swhtr is dispensable for normal heart development and function, but becomes essential for the tissue adaptation process after myocardial infarction. Re-expressing Swhtr from an exogenous locus rescues the Swhtr null phenotype. Genes depending on Swhtr after cardiac stress are significantly occupied, and therefore most likely regulated by NKX2-5. Our results indicate a synergistic role for Swhtr and the developmentally essential transcription factor NKX2-5 in tissue adaptation after myocardial injury.",

    "abstract": "Neurite pruning and regrowth are important mechanisms to adapt neural circuits to distinct developmental stages. Neurite regrowth after pruning often depends on differential regulation of growth signaling pathways, but their precise mechanisms of action during regrowth are unclear. Here, we show that the PI3K/TORC1 pathway is required for dendrite regrowth after pruning in Drosophila peripheral neurons during metamorphosis. TORC1 impinges on translation initiation, and our analysis of 5 untranslated regions (UTRs) of remodeling factor mRNAs linked to actin suggests that TOR selectively stimulates the translation of regrowth over pruning factors. Furthermore, we find that dendrite regrowth also requires the GTPase RalA and the exocyst complex as regulators of polarised secretion, and we provide evidence that this pathway is also regulated by TOR. We propose that TORC1 coordinates dendrite regrowth after pruning by coordinately stimulating the translation of regrowth factors involved in cytoskeletal regulation and secretion.\n\nAuthor SummaryDuring development, neurons grow axons and dendrites that they use to make synaptic connections. Such connections are often fine-tuned through pruning and regrowth of axons and dendrites, but the coordination of the two processes is not well understood. It had previously been shown that hormone signaling suppresses the TORC1 growth pathway during pruning of Drosophila sensory neuron dendrites. We found that TORC1 is required for the subsequent regrowth of these dendrites. TORC1 activates protein biosynthesis, and our analyses suggest that it primarily targets neurite growth pathways, but not degenerative pathways. These growth pathways include the actin cytoskeleton and the secretion machinery with the small GTPase RalA. Thus, the TORC1 growth pathway is a major hub coordinating neurite pruning and regrowth.",

We find that ORF3c acts after stimulation with cytoplasmic RNA helicases RIG-I or MDA5 or adaptor protein MAVS, but not after TRIF, TBK1 or phospho-IRF3 stimulation. ORF3c co-immunoprecipitates with the antiviral proteins MAVS and PGAM5 and induces MAVS cleavage by caspase-3.

    "abstract": "Understanding the allocation of the cellular proteome to different cellular processes is central to unraveling the organizing principles of bacterial physiology. Proteome allocation to protein translation itself is maximally efficient, i.e., it represents the minimal allocation of dry mass able to sustain the observed protein production rate. In contrast, recent studies on bacteria have demonstrated that the concentrations of many proteins exceed the minimal level required to support the observed growth rate, indicating some heterogeneity across pathways in their proteome efficiency. Here, we systematically analyze the proteome efficiency of metabolic pathways, which together account for more than half of the E. coli proteome during exponential growth. Comparing the predicted minimal and the observed proteome allocation to different metabolic pathways across growth conditions, we find that the most costly biosynthesis pathways - those for amino acid biosynthesis and cofactor biosynthesis - are expressed for near optimal efficiency. Overall, proteome efficiency increases along the carbon flow through the metabolic network: proteins involved in pathways of nutrient uptake and central metabolism tend to be highly over-abundant, while proteins involved in anabolic pathways and in protein translation are much closer to the expected minimal abundance across conditions. Our work thus provides a birds-eye view of metabolic pathway efficiency, demonstrating systematic deviations from optimal cellular efficiency at the network level.\n\nImportanceProtein translation is the most expensive cellular process in fast-growing bacteria, and efficient proteome usage should thus be under strong natural selection. However, recent studies show that a considerable part of the proteome is unneeded for instantaneous cell growth in E. coli. We still lack a systematic understanding of how this excess proteome is distributed across different pathways as a function of the growth conditions. We estimated the minimal required proteome across growth conditions in E. coli and compared the predictions with experimental data. We found that the proteome allocated to the most expensive internal pathways, including translation and the synthesis of amino acids and cofactors, are near the minimally required levels. In contrast, transporters and central carbon metabolism show much higher proteome levels than the predicted minimal abundance. Our analyses show that the proteome fraction unneeded for instantaneous cell growth decreases along the nutrient flow in E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Enzymes involved in rescuing stalled ribosomes and recycling translation machinery are ubiquitous in bacteria and required for growth. Peptidyl tRNA drop-off is a type of abortive translation that results in the release of a truncated peptide that is still bound to tRNA (peptidyl tRNA) into the cytoplasm. Peptidyl tRNA hydrolase (Pth) recycles the released tRNA by cleaving off the unfinished peptide and is essential in most bacterial species. We developed a sequencing-based strategy called Cu-tRNAseq to study the physiological role of Pth in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). While most peptidyl tRNA species accumulated in a strain with impaired Pth expression, peptidyl prolyl-tRNA was particularly enriched, suggesting that Pth is required for robust peptidyl prolyl-tRNA turnover. Reducing Pth levels increased Mtbs susceptibility to tRNA synthetase inhibitors that are in development to treat tuberculosis (TB) and rendered this pathogen highly susceptible to macrolides, drugs that are ordinarily ineffective against Mtb. Collectively, our findings reveal the potency of Cu-tRNAseq for profiling peptidyl tRNAs and suggest that targeting Pth would open new therapeutic approaches for TB.",

    "abstract": "Desulfovibrio vulgaris has been the primary pure culture sulfate reducer for developing microbial corrosion concepts. Multiple mechanisms for how it accepts electrons from Fe0 have been proposed. We investigated Fe0 oxidation with a mutant of D. vulgaris in which hydrogenase genes were deleted. The hydrogenase mutant grew as well as the parental strain with lactate as the electron donor, but unlike the parental strain was not able to grow on H2. The parental strain reduced sulfate with Fe0 as the sole electron donor, but the hydrogenase mutant did not. H2 accumulated over time in Fe0 cultures of the hydrogenase mutant and sterile controls, but not in parental strain cultures. Sulfide stimulated H2 production in uninoculated controls apparently by both reacting with Fe0 to generate H2 and facilitating electron transfer from Fe0 to H+. Parental strain supernatants did not accelerate H2 production from Fe0, ruling out a role for extracellular hydrogenases. Previously proposed electron transfer between Fe0 and D. vulgaris via soluble electron shuttles was not evident. The hydrogenase mutant did not reduce sulfate in the presence of Fe0 and either riboflavin or anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate and these potential electron shuttles did not stimulate parental strain sulfate reduction with Fe0 as the electron donor. The results demonstrate that D. vulgaris primarily accepts electrons from Fe0 via H2 as an intermediary electron carrier. These findings clarify the interpretation of previous D. vulgaris corrosion studies and suggest that H2-mediated electron transfer is an important mechanism for iron corrosion under sulfate-reducing conditions.\n\nImportanceMicrobial corrosion of iron in the presence of sulfate-reducing microorganisms is economically significant. There is substantial debate over how microbes accelerate iron corrosion. Tools for genetic manipulation have only been developed for a few Fe(III)-reducing and methanogenic microorganisms known to corrode iron and in each case those microbes were found to accept electrons from Fe0 via direct electron transfer. However, iron corrosion is often most intense in the presence of sulfate-reducing microbes. The finding that Desulfovibrio vulgaris relies on H2 to shuttle electrons between Fe0 and cells revives the concept, developed in some of the earliest studies on microbial corrosion, that sulfate reducers consumption of H2 is a major microbial corrosion mechanism. The results further emphasize that direct Fe0-to-microbe electron transfer has yet to be rigorously demonstrated in sulfate-reducing microbes.",

To identify bacteria and fungi that are resistant and susceptible to habitat changes respectively, we retrieved paired 16S and ITS rRNA amplicon sequence data from 1,580 host, soil, and aquatic samples and explored the ecological patterns of the thousands of detected bacterial and fungal genera. Through this large-scale analysis, we identified 48 bacterial and 4 fungal genera that were prevalent and abundant across the three biomes, demonstrating their resilience in diverse environmental conditions. These generalists comprised a substantial fraction of the taxonomic diversity of their respective kingdom. Their distribution across samples explained a large percentage of the variation in the cross-kingdom community structure. We also found that the genomes of these generalists were larger and encoded more secondary metabolism and antimicrobial resistance genes, illuminating how they can dominate diverse microbial communities. Conversely, 30 bacterial and 19 fungal genera were only found in a single habitat, suggesting they cannot readily adapt to different and changing environments. These findings can contribute to designing microbiome-mediated strategies for pressing global changes.\n\nSignificanceHumans, plants, and aquatic and soil environments are home to a collection of microorganisms, known as their microbiome. The microbial communities are becoming increasingly perturbed by environmental change and changes in their associated hosts. Through the analysis of 1,580 microbiomes, we identify a small number of bacteria and fungi that can achieve high abundance in diverse host, aquatic, and soil environments, demonstrating their resilience to variable environments. These microbes contribute to microbiome diversity and more frequently engage in positive interactions with other microbes.

While individual bacterial genomes show signatures of organization (e.g., operons), pan-genomes reveal genome fluidity, both in terms of gene content and order (synteny). Here we ask how mutational forces (including recombination and horizontal gene transfer) combine with selection and gene interactions to shape genome organization and variation both within and across strains. We first build an evolutionary simulation model to assess the impact of gene interactions on pan-genome structure. A neutral evolutionary model can produce transient co-segregation of initially linked genes but is vulnerable on longer time-scales to perturbing mutational events. In contrast, incorporation of modular gene fitness interactions can produce sustainable clusters of linked and co-segregating genes, with the network of co-segregation recapitulating the defined simulation  ground-truth network of gene interactions. To test our model predictions, we exploit the increasing number of closed genomes in model species to define gene co-segregation networks in the pan-genomes of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using these highly curated pan-genomes, we identify modular clusters of physically linked and co-segregating genes and show that the resulting co-segregation networks map onto underlying gene-regulatory and metabolic gene interaction networks. The results imply that co-segregation networks can contribute to accessory genome annotation, and more generally that gene interactions are the primary force shaping genome structure and operon evolution.",

    "abstract": "Retrotransposons are a class of transposable elements capable of self-replication and insertion into new genomic locations. Across species, the mobilization of retrotransposons in somatic cells has been suggested to contribute to the cell and tissue functional decline that occurs during aging. Retrotransposon expression generally increases with age, and de novo insertions have been observed to occur during tumorigenesis. However, the extent to which new retrotransposon insertions occur during normal aging and their effect on cellular and animal function remains understudied. Here we use a single nucleus whole genome sequencing approach in Drosophila to directly test whether transposon insertions increase with age in somatic cells. Analyses of nuclei from thoraces and indirect flight muscles using a newly developed pipeline, Retrofind, revealed no significant increase in the number of transposon insertions with age. Despite this, reducing the expression of two different retrotransposons, 412 and Roo, extends lifespan, without increasing stress resistance. This suggests a key role for transposon expression and not insertion in regulating longevity. Transcriptomic analyses revealed similar changes to gene expression in 412 and Roo knockdown flies and highlighted potential changes to genes involved in proteolysis and immune function as potential contributors to the observed changes in longevity. Combined, our data show a clear link between retrotransposon expression and aging.\n\nAuthor SummaryWith the onset of modern medicine, the average age of the population has significantly increased, leading to more individuals living with chronic health issues. Rather than treat each age-associated disorder individually, one approach to target multiple health concerns simultaneously might to be target aging itself. Genomic instability is a hallmark of aging cells that has been proposed to be a key contributor to age-associated cellular decline. Transposons are mobile genetic elements capable of inserting into new genomic locations, thus having the potential to increase genomic instability. Consistent with this, transposon expression generally increases with age. However, the extent to which transposon insertions accumulate to disrupt the genome of cells within aging individuals has remained an open question. We specifically answer this through single cell whole genome sequencing and find that transposon insertions do not increase with age. Even though insertions did not increase, the expression of transposons is linked to aging, as reducing the expression of individual transposons extended lifespan. Transcriptome studies of these long-lived flies revealed increased expression of genes linked to proteolysis genes and to functioning of the immune system. Our study therefore establishes transposon expression, and not insertion, as a critical contributor to animal aging.",

    "abstract": "Single-strand annealing (SSA) is initiated when a double strand break (DSB) occurs between two flanking repeated sequences, resulting in a deletion that leaves a single copy of the repeat. We studied budding yeast strains carrying two 200-bp URA3 sequences separated by 2.3-kb of phage lambda DNA in which a site-specific DSB can be created by HO or Cas9 endonucleases. Repeat-mediated deletion requires removal of long 3-ended single-stranded tails (flaps) by Rad1-Rad10 with the assistance of Msh2-Msh3 and Slx4. A natural 3% divergence between repeats (designated F and A) causes a significant reduction in the frequency of SSA repair. This decrease is caused by heteroduplex rejection in which mismatches (MMs) in the annealed intermediate are recognized by the MutS (Msh2 and Msh6) components of the MM repair (MMR) pathway coupled to unwinding of the duplex by the Sgs1-Rmi1-Top3 helicase. MutL homologs, Mlh1-Pms1 (MutL) are not required for rejection but play their expected role in mismatch correction. Remarkably, heteroduplex rejection is very low in strains where the identical repeats were immediately adjacent (Tailless strains) and the DSB was induced by Cas9. These results suggest that the presence of nonhomologous tails strongly stimulates heteroduplex rejection in SSA. DNA sequencing analysis of SSA products from the FA Tailed strain, where the F variant carries six single-base mutations and one +1(T) insertion within a run of 10 Ts showed a gradient of correction favoring the sequence opposite each 3 end of the annealed strand. Mismatches (MMs) located in the center of the repair intermediate were corrected by Msh2-Msh6 mediated mismatch correction, while correction of MMs at the extremity of the SSA intermediate often appears to use a different mechanism, using either 3 nonhomologous tail removal or 3 to 5 \"proofreading\" resection by DNA polymerase {delta} followed by synthesis to fill in the gap. In contrast, in FA Tailless strains there was a uniform repair of the MMs across the repeat, with a bias in favor of the \"left\" copy. A distinctive pattern of correction was found in the absence of MSH2, in both Tailed and Tailless strains, while the deletion of MSH6 resulted in unrepaired MMs.",

We used this pipeline to acquire the sequences of highly similar copies of the cidA and cidB genes present in the genomes of Wolbachia pipientis (wPip) bacteria infecting the cells of Culex pipiens mosquitoes. The approach is based on read mapping, SNP calling and haplotyping, using our already wide existing reference database for the cid genes obtained by cloning and Sanger sequencing. We addressed problems commonly faced when using mapping approaches for multi-copy gene families with highly similar variants (or haplotypes). In addition, we confirmed that PCR amplification causes frequent chimeras which have to be carefully considered when working on families of recombinant genes. We tested the robustness of the pipeline through a combination of analyses of simulated reads and of gene sequence acquisitions through cloning and Sanger sequencing. For genes of which the haplotype cannot be reconstructed from short reads sequencing, this pipeline confers a high throughput acquisition, gives reliable results as well as insights of the relative copy numbers of the different variants.",

Here, we report the genome assembly of an improved Japanese strain Nichi01, in which the cocoon yield is comparable to that of commercial silkworm strains. The integration of PacBio Sequel II long-read and ddRAD-seq-based high-density genetic linkage map achieved the highest quality genome assembly of silkworms to date; 22 of the 28 pseudomolecules contained telomeric repeats at both ends, and only four gaps were present in the assembly. A total of 452 Mbp of the assembly with an N50 of 16.614 Mbp covered 99.3% of the complete orthologs of the Arthropod core genes. Although the genome sequence of Nichi01 and that of the previously reported low-yielding tropical strain p50T assured their accuracy in most regions, we corrected several regions, misassembled in p50T, in our assembly. A total of 18,397 proteins were predicted using over 95 Gb of mRNA-seq derived from 10 different organs, covering 96.9% of the complete orthologs of the Arthropod core genes. The final assembly and annotation files are available in KAIKObase (https://kaikobase.dna.affrc.go.jp/index.html) along with a genome browser and BLAST searching service, which would facilitate further studies and the breeding of silkworms and other insects.",

Prdx form H2O2-induced disulfide complexes with many proteins, including multiple kinases involved in P38 MAPK signaling. Here we show that a genetically-encoded fusion between Prdx and the P38 MAPK is sufficient to hyperactivate the kinase in yeast and human cells by a mechanism that does not require the H2O2-sensing cysteine of the Prdx. In yeast, we demonstrate that a P38-Prdx fusion protein compensates for the loss of a scaffold protein and upstream MAP3K kinase activity, driving entry into mitosis. Based on our findings, we propose that the H2O2-induced formation of Prdx-MAPK disulfide complexes provides a scaffold and signaling platform for MAPKK-MAPK signaling.

    "abstract": "Proteases comprise the class of enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, thereby playing a pivotal role in many aspects of life. The amino acids surrounding the scissile bond determine the susceptibility towards protease-mediated hydrolysis. A detailed understanding of the cleavage specificity of a protease can lead to the identification of its endogenous substrates, while it is also essential for the design of inhibitors. We developed a new method which combines the high diversity of a combinatorial synthetic peptide library with the sensitivity and detection power of mass spectrometry to determine protease cleavage specificity. We applied this method to study a group of bacterial metalloproteases that have the unique specificity to cleave between two prolines, i.e. Pro-Pro endopeptidases (PPEPs). We not only confirmed the prime-side specificity of PPEP-1 and PPEP-2, but also revealed some new unexpected peptide substrates. Moreover, we have characterized a new PPEP (PPEP-3) which has a prime-side specificity that is very different from that of the other two PPEPs. Importantly, the approach that we present in this study is generic and can be extended to investigate the specificity of other proteases.",

Saccharomyces cerevisiae possesses two predicted CHI-like proteins, Aim18p (encoded by YHR198C) and Aim46p (YHR199C), but it lacks other enzymes of the flavonoid pathway, suggesting that Aim18p and Aim46p employ the CHI fold for distinct purposes. Here, we demonstrate that Aim18p and Aim46p reside on the mitochondrial inner membrane and adopt CHI folds, but they lack select active site residues and possess an extra fungal-specific loop. Consistent with these differences, Aim18p and Aim46p lack chalcone isomerase activity and also the fatty acid-binding capabilities of other CHI-like proteins, but instead bind heme. We further show that diverse fungal homologs also bind heme and that Aim18p and Aim46p possess structural homology to a bacterial hemoprotein. Collectively, our work reveals a distinct function and cellular localization for two CHI-like proteins, introduces a new variation of a hemoprotein fold, and suggests that ancestral CHI-like proteins were hemoproteins.",

However, the dominant industrial process for DA synthesis involves energy-intensive, multistage chemical reactions that are harmful to the environment. For instance, 1,6-hexanediamine (HMD), one of most prominent monomers in nylon-66 synthesis, is mainly synthesized with currently high technological control by butadiene hydrocyanation, which suffers from the use of highly toxic hydrogen cyanide, unsatisfactory selectivity and a complex separation process. Thus, the development of sustainable green DA synthetic routes is highly desired. Herein, we report an efficient one-pot in vivo biocatalytic cascade for the transformation of cycloalkanes into DAs with the aid of advanced techniques, including the RetroBioCat tool for biocatalytic route design, enzyme mining for finding appropriate enzymes and microbial consortia construction for efficient pathway assembly. As a result, DAs are successfully produced by the developed microbial consortia-based biocatalytic system, especially HMD, and product concentrations as high as 16.5 mM and 7.6 mM are achieved when using cyclohexanol (CHOL) or cyclohexane (CH) as substrates, respectively. This also represents the highest HMD biosynthesis productivity to date. Other cycloalkanes also serve as substrates, indicating the generality of our approach.",

Microbial redox-sensitive transformations therein result in the loss and overall geochemical deficit in inorganic fixed nitrogen in the water column, thereby impacting global climate in terms of nutrient equilibrium and greenhouse gases.\n\nHere, geochemical data are combined with metagenomes, metatranscriptomes and stable-isotope probing incubations from the water column and subseafloor of the Benguela Upwelling System. Taxonomic assemblages and relative expression of functional marker genes are used to explore metabolic activities by nitrifiers and denitrifiers under decreased stratification and increased lateral ventilation in Namibian coastal waters. Active planktonic nitrifiers were affiliated with Candidatus Nitrosopumilus and Candidatus Nitrosopelagicus among Archaea, and Nitrospina, Nitrosomonas, Nitrosococcus, and Nitrospira among Bacteria. Concurrent evidence from taxonomic and functional marker genes shows that populations of Nitrososphaeria and Nitrospinota were highly active under dysoxic conditions, coupling ammonia and nitrite oxidation with respiratory nitrite reduction, but minor metabolic activity towards mixotrophic use of simple nitrogen compounds. Although active reduction of nitric oxide to nitrous oxide by Nitrospirota, Gammaproteobacteria and Desulfobacterota was tractable in bottom waters, the produced nitrous oxide was apparently scavenged at the ocean surface by Bacteroidota. Planctomycetota involved in anaerobic ammonia oxidation were identified in dysoxic waters and their underlying sediments, but were not found to be metabolically active due to limited availability of nitrite. Consistent with water column geochemical profiles, metatranscriptomic data demonstrate that nitrifier denitrification prevails over canonical denitrification when Namibian coastal waters are ventilated during austral winter.",

    "abstract": "A key element of Plasmodium biology and pathogenesis is the trafficking of ~10% of the parasite proteome into the host red blood cell (RBC) it infects. To cross the parasite-encasing parasitophorous vacuole membrane, exported proteins utilise a channel-containing protein complex termed the Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX). PTEX is obligatory for parasite survival, both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that at least some exported proteins have essential metabolic functions. However, to date only one essential PTEX-dependent process, the new permeability pathway, has been described. To identify other essential PTEX-dependant proteins/processes, we conditionally knocked down the expression of one of its core components, PTEX150, and examined which metabolic pathways were affected. Surprisingly, the food vacuole mediated process of haemoglobin (Hb) digestion was substantially perturbed by PTEX150 knockdown. Using a range of transgenic parasite lines and approaches, we show that two major Hb proteases; falcipain 2a and plasmepsin II, interact with PTEX core components, implicating the translocons involvement in the trafficking of Hb proteases. We propose a model where these proteases are translocated into the PV via PTEX in order to reach the cytostome, located at the parasite periphery, prior to food vacuole entry. This work offers a another mechanistic explanation for why PTEX function is essential for growth of the parasite within its host RBC.\n\nAuthor summaryPlasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of malaria in humans, where the symptoms of the disease are derived from the continuous asexual replication of the parasite within the human red blood cells (RBCs) it infects. To survive within this niche, the parasite exports hundreds of parasite effector proteins across the vacuole it resides within and into the RBC. About a quarter of the exported proteins appear to be essential during the blood stage but the functions of these proteins largely remain uncharacterised. Protein export is facilitated by an essential protein complex termed the Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX). Conditional depletion of PTEXs core components results in rapid parasite death presumably because essential proteins do not reach their functional destination in the RBC and their associated metabolic functions cannot be performed. To uncover what these essential metabolic functions are we knocked down PTEX150, a core component of PTEX. Metabolic analysis of the knockdown parasites indicated that haemoglobin (Hb) digestion was inhibited resulting in a reduction of Hb derived peptides, which serve as an amino acid source for the parasite. We determined that knocking down HSP101, another PTEX core component, also disrupted the Hb digestion pathway. Furthermore, we provide evidence that reduction of Hb digestion might be due to the failure to efficiently deliver early acting Hb digesting proteases to the cytostome, a specialised location where vesicles of Hb are taken into the parasite. PTEX may therefore play a role in delivering Hb proteases to the cytostome.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila delivers more than 330 effector proteins into host cells through its Dot/Icm type IV secretion system (T4SS) to facilitate its intracellular replication. A number of these effectors modulate organelle trafficking pathways to create a membrane-bound niche called the Legionella containing vacuole (LCV). In this study, we found that L. pneumophila induces F-actin accumulation in host cell cortex by its Dot/Icm substrate RavJ (Lpg0944). RavJ harbors an C101H138D170 motif associated with human tissue transglutaminases (TGs). We showed that RavJ catalyzes a covalent linkage between actin and the Motin family proteins Angiomotin (AMOT) and Angiomotin-like 1 (AMOTL1), proteins known to regulate tube formation and cell migration. Further study revealed that RavJ-induced crosslink between actin and AMOT occurs on its Gln354 residue. Crosslink between actin and AMOT significantly reduces the binding between actin and its binding partner cofilin, suggesting that RavJ inhibits actin depolymerization. We also demonstrated that the metaeffector LegL1 directly interacts with RavJ to antagonize its transglutaminase activity, leading to reduced crosslink between actin and Motin proteins. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of modulating the host actin cytoskeleton by L. pneumophila.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa adapts to solid surfaces to enhance virulence and infect its host. Type IV pili (T4P), long and thin filaments that power surface-specific twitching motility, allow single cells to mechanosense surfaces. For example, cells sense T4P attachment to control the direction of twitching motility. In this process, they establish a local positive feedback that polarizes T4P distribution to the sensing pole. A complex chemotaxis-like system called Chp mediates this response. The signalling mechanism allowing for transduction of this spatially-resolved signal is however unresolved. Here we demonstrate that the two Chp response regulators PilG and PilH enable dynamic cell polarization by coupling their antagonistic functions on T4P extension. By precisely quantifying the localization of fluorescent protein fusions, we show that PilG polarizes in response to mechanosensing through phosphorylation by the histidine kinase ChpA. We find that PilH is not inherently required for reversals. However, PilH activation is necessary to break the local positive feedback established by PilG so that forward-twitching cells can reverse. To spatially resolve mechanical signals, Chp thus locally transduces signals with a main output response regulator, PilG. To respond to signal changes, Chp uses its second regulator PilH to break the local feedback. By identifying the molecular functions of two response regulators that dynamically control cell polarization, our work provides a rationale for the diversity of architectures often found in non-canonical chemotaxis systems.",

However, there is limited knowledge about PRCs interacting proteins and their interplay with PRCs in epigenome reshaping, which is fundamental to understand gene regulatory mechanisms. Here, we identified UBIQUITIN SPECIFIC PROTEASE 5 (UBP5) as a novel interactor of the PRC2 subunit SWINGER and its associated factor PWO1 in Arabidopsis thaliana. As inferred from the functional analyses of ubp5 CRISPR-Cas9 mutant plants, UBP5 regulates plant development and stress responses, notably by promoting H2A monoubiquitination erasure, leading to transcriptional de-repression. Preferential association of UBP5 at PRC2 recruiting motifs and local H3K27me3 gaining in ubp5 mutant plants further suggest the existence of functional interplays between UBP5 and PRC2 in regulating epigenome dynamics. In summary, UBP5 provides novel insights to disentangle the complex PRC2 interaction network and is a crucial regulator of the pivotal epigenetic repressive marks H2Aub and H3K27me3.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetic comparative methods have long been a mainstay of evolutionary biology, allowing for inferences of the tempo and mode of trait evolution across species while accounting for their common ancestry. These analyses typically assume a single, bifurcating phylogenetic tree that describes the shared history among species. However, modern phylogenomic analyses have shown that genomes are often composed of a mosaic of different histories that can disagree both with the species tree and with each other--so-called discordant gene trees. These gene trees describe shared histories that are not captured by the species tree, and therefore that are unaccounted for in classic comparative approaches. The application of standard phylogenetic comparative methods to species histories containing discordance leads to incorrect inferences about the timing, direction, and rate of evolution. Here, we develop two approaches for incorporating gene tree histories into comparative methods: one involves constructing a fuller phylogenetic variance-covariance matrix that includes relationships not found in the species tree, and another that applies Felsensteins pruning algorithm over a set of gene trees to calculate trait histories and likelihoods. Both approaches are agnostic to the biological causes of gene tree discordance, which may include incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. Using simulation, we demonstrate that our new approaches generate much more accurate estimates of tree-wide rates of trait evolution than standard methods. We apply our methods to two clades of the wild tomato genus Solanum with varying rates of discordance, demonstrating the contribution of gene tree discordance to variation in a set of floral traits and the ability of our approaches to provide more accurate inferences. Our new approaches have the potential to be applied to a broad range of classic inference problems in phylogenetics, including ancestral state reconstruction and the inference of lineage-specific rate shifts.",

    "abstract": "Fungi are among the most ecologically important heterotrophs that have radiated into most niches on Earth and fulfil key ecological services. However, despite intense interest in their origins, major genomic trends characterising the evolutionary route from a unicellular opisthokont ancestor to derived multicellular fungi remain poorly known. Here, we reconstructed gene family evolution across 123 genomes of fungi and relatives and show that a dominant trend in early fungal evolution has been the gradual shedding of protist genes and highly episodic innovation via gene duplication. We find that the gene content of early-diverging fungi is protist-like in many respects, owing to the conservation of protist genes in early fungi. While gene loss has been constant and gradual during early fungal evolution, our reconstructions show that gene innovation showed two peaks. Gene groups with the largest contribution to genomic change included extracellular proteins, transcription factors, as well as ones linked to the coordination of nutrient uptake with growth, highlighting the transition to a sessile osmotrophic feeding strategy and subsequent lifestyle evolution as important elements of early fungal evolution. Taken together, this work provided a highly resolved genome-wide catalogue of gene family changes across fungal evolution. This suggests that the genome of pre-fungal ancestors may have been transformed into the archetypal fungal genome by a combination of gradual gene loss, turnover and two large duplication events rather than by abrupt changes, and consequently, that the taxonomically defined fungal kingdom does not represent a genomically uniform assemblage of extant species characterized by diagnostic synapomorphies.",

Recent advances in the exDNA extraction methodology allow a better profiling of the pool of ARGs. However, little is known about how stress conditions modify the distribution of ARGs between both DNA fractions. Here, we performed two batch tests for analyzing the effects of two different stress conditions, namely nutrient starvation and high concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (1, 10 and 150 mg L-1) in activated sludge. We tracked by qPCR the resulting relative abundances of four target genes, namely the universal 16S rRNA gene, the class 1 integron-integrase gene intI1, and the sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 and sul2 in both the iDNA and exDNA fractions. In the exDNA pool, unlike starvation, which provoked a decrease of 1-2 log10 [copies] ng DNA-1 in the concentration of sul1 and intI1, the presence of sulfamethoxazole did not influence the abundances of sul1 and sul2. However, high concentrations of sulfamethoxazole (150 mg L- 1) selected for microorganisms harboring sul1 and, more remarkably, sul2 genes in their iDNA during their exponential growth phase. The abundances of intI1 and sul1 were positively correlated in the exDNA fraction (r>0.7), whereas no significant correlation (p<0.05) between the abundance of these two genes was found in the iDNA fraction of the sludge. High SMX concentrations influenced the abundance of ARGs in the iDNA; their abundance in the exDNA was influenced by nutrient limitations. Further studies should consider the profiling of exDNA fractions because of the relationship between ARGs and mobile genetic elements. Besides, the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance is encouraged in wastewater treatment plants facing high antibiotic concentrations.\n\nHighlightsO_LIStarvation caused a decrease in the exDNA concentration of the activated sludge.\nC_LIO_LIA positive correlation in the abundances of intI1 and sul1 was found in the exDNA fraction.\nC_LIO_LIHigh concentrations of SMX selected for antibiotic resistant microorganisms.\nC_LI",

While molecular chaperones are well-known suppressors of these aberrant events, we recently reported that a widespread family of heat-resistant obscure (Hero) proteins may also play a similar role. However, it is unclear how such electrostatically charged intrinsically disordered proteins protect client proteins from denaturation and aggregation. Here we utilize single-molecule FRET to monitor the conformations of an aggregation-prone protein, TDP-43. While we observed high conformational heterogeneity of wild-type TDP-43, the ALS-associated mutation A315T promoted collapsed conformations. In contrast, a canonical passive chaperone, DNAJA2, and a Hero protein, Hero11, both of which prevent TDP-43 aggregation in cells, promoted extended conformations. Our results link single-molecule effects on the TDP-43 conformation to macro effects on bulk aggregation propensity, where a Hero protein, like a canonical chaperone, maintains the conformational integrity of a client protein to prevent its aggregation.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPaediatric neuroblastoma and brain tumours account for a third of all childhood cancer-related mortality. High-risk neuroblastoma is highly aggressive and survival is poor despite intensive multi-modal therapies with significant toxicity. Novel therapies are desperately needed. The Zika virus (ZIKV) is neurotropic and there is growing interest in employing ZIKV as a potential therapy against paediatric nervous system tumours, including neuroblastoma.\n\nMETHODSHere, we perform an extensive meta-analysis of ZIKV infection studies to identify molecular mechanisms that may govern the oncolytic response in neuroblastoma cells. We summarise the neuroblastoma cell lines and ZIKV strains utilised and re-evaluate the infection data to deduce the susceptibility of neuroblastoma to the ZIKV oncolytic response. Integrating transcriptomics, interaction proteomics, dependency factor and compound datasets we show the involvement of multiple host systems during ZIKV infection.\n\nRESULTSWe identify that most paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines are highly susceptible to ZIKV infection and that the PRVABC59 ZIKV strain is the most promising candidate for neuroblastoma oncolytic virotherapy. ZIKV induces TNF signalling, lipid metabolism, the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), and downregulates cell cycle and DNA replication processes. ZIKV is dependent on SREBP-regulated lipid metabolism and three protein complexes; V-ATPase, ER Membrane Protein Complex (EMC) and mammalian translocon. We propose ZIKV nonstructural protein 4B (NS4B) as a likely mediator of ZIKVs interaction with IRE1-mediated UPR, lipid metabolism and mammalian translocon.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur work provides a significant understanding of ZIKV infection in neuroblastoma cells, which will facilitate the progression of ZIKV-based oncolytic virotherapy through pre-clinical research and clinical trials.\n\nKEYPOINTSO_LIThe Zika virus may provide the basis for an oncolytic virotherapy against Neuroblastoma\nC_LIO_LIMost paediatric neuroblastoma cell lines are susceptible to Zika viral infection\nC_LIO_LIWe identified molecular mechanisms that may induce the oncolytic response in Neuroblastoma\nC_LI\n\nContribution to the fieldThe ability to both induce direct oncolysis and provoke an anti-tumoral immune response makes oncolytic virotherapy an attractive candidate to combat aggressive and heterogenous cancers, such as high-risk neuroblastoma. To progress oncolytic virotherapy to clinical trial it is essential to understand the host mechanisms the virus manipulates to kill cancer cells, alongside any pathology as a consequence of infection of normal cells. Here, we show that ZIKV efficiently infects and induces oncolysis of paediatric neuroblastoma cells and propose a potential TNF pathway-driven immune response. ZIKVs specificity for infection of nervous system cancer cells, while rarely causing nervous system-related pathology in young children, addresses many of its safety concerns. The inclusion of more effective and less toxic novel therapies, such as a potential ZIKV-based therapeutic, in multimodal treatment regimens will pave the way for improving patient long-term health and overall survival.",

Reliability of the DFC parameters is, at best, intermediate with an ICC = 0.51 for prevalence for not-centered, 16 min. data and the coarse atlas. Moreover, MDTs of both states were positively correlated for centered data. Prevalence of one state was positively correlated with MDT of the same state and frequently negatively correlated with MDT of the other state. Var was positively correlated with MDT and Prev for the same state and negatively correlated for the other state for not-centered data. This study suggests that prevalence is the most reliable DFC parameter with lower reliability for shorter scans, more atlas regions and centering. Thus, it is advantageous to formulate hypotheses related to brain dynamics in terms of prevalence, especially in small-scale studies.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) represents a promising non-invasive treatment for an increasingly wide range of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. The ability to use periodically oscillating electric fields to non-invasively engage neural dynamics opens up the possibility of recruiting synaptic plasticity and to modulate brain function. However, despite consistent reports about tACS clinical effectiveness, strong state-dependence combined with the ubiquitous heterogeneity of cortical networks collectively results in high outcome variability. Introducing variations in intrinsic neuronal timescales, we explored how such heterogeneity influences stimulation-induced change in synaptic connectivity. We examined how spike timing dependent plasticity, at the level of cells, intra- and inter-laminar cortical networks, can be selectively and preferentially engaged by periodic stimulation. Using computational simulations informed by human experimental data, we analyzed cortical circuits comprised of multiple cell-types, alongside superficial multi-layered networks expressing distinct layer-specific timescales. Our results show that mismatch in neuronal timescales within and/or between cells - and the resulting variability in excitability, temporal integration properties and frequency tuning - enables selective and directional control on synaptic connectivity by tACS. Our work provides new vistas on how to recruit neural heterogeneity to guide brain plasticity using non-invasive stimulation paradigms.\n\nAuthor summaryBrain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), are increasingly used to treat mental health disorders and to probe brain function. Despite promising results, it remains unclear how these non-invasive interventions impact both the dynamics and connectivity of neural circuits. We developed an interdisciplinary framework showing that heterogeneity in neuronal timescales, and its consequences on cellular excitability and temporal integration properties of cortical neurons, may lead to selective and directional control on synaptic modifications by tACS. Differences in neuron responses resulting from timescale mismatch establishes phase- and frequency-specific tuning relationships which may be recruited by periodic stimuli to guide synaptic plasticity. We confirmed this using both intra - and inter-laminar cortical circuit models comprised of multiple cell-types and informed by experimental data. Our work showcases how heterogeneity might be used to guide synaptic plasticity using non-invasive stimulation paradigms.",

    "abstract": "Conscious perception is thought to depend on global amplification of sensory input. In recent years, the basal ganglia have been implicated in gating conscious access due to their consistent involvement in thalamocortical loops. However, much of the evidence implicating the basal ganglia in these processes in humans is correlational. The current study is a preliminary investigation in four patients to explore whether deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the basal ganglia might improve conscious perception. In our study, treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) patients with a striatal DBS implant completed two canonical conscious perception tasks: emotion-induced blindness and backward masking. We found preliminary evidence in support of a role played by the basal ganglia in conscious perception at the behavioral level: patients performed better when stimulation was active, but we could not establish neural effects corresponding to these behavioral findings, possibly due to our small sample size. We discuss the potential implications and limitations of our study and delineate avenues for future research.",

We analyzed four parameters: lateral bundle width, axial bundle height, cross-sectional area, and the shape of individual bundles. We showed that axon bundles became wider and thicker at 3-days post ONC. The bundle swelling at 3-days post-ONC has correlated with about 15% retinal ganglion cell (RGC) soma loss. At 6-days post-ONC, axon bundles showed a significant reduction in lateral width and cross-sectional area, followed by a reduction in bundle height at 9-days post-ONC. Bundle shrinking at 9-days post-ONC has correlated with about 68% RGC soma loss. Both experimental and simulated results suggested that the cross-sectional area of individual RGC axon bundles is more sensitive than the bundle width and height to indicate RGC soma loss. This study is the first to track and quantify individual RGC axon bundles in vivo following ONC injury and establish the correlation between the morphological changes of RGC axon bundles and RGC soma loss.",

    "abstract": "Sexual selection is thought to be a potent evolutionary force giving rise to diversity in sexual traits that enhance mating success, such as ornament, sexual display, and weapons. The expression of sexual traits is often influenced by environmental conditions, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may precede and facilitate evolutionary divergence in sexual traits by sexual selection. However, the mechanisms that promote plasticity in sexual traits remain poorly understood. Using the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni, we show that sexual selection may promote plasticity in sexual traits. In this species, males change between yellow and blue color and exhibit intense male contest competition over breeding territories to attract females. We found that experimentally increased competition over territories led to a higher proportion of males expressing the yellow phenotype. Furthermore, we found that expression of yellow coloration is beneficial to males in territorial disputes. Specifically, yellow males won more staged dyadic contests than blue males, and yellow males had a lower level of oxidative stress than blue males, especially when engaging in more territorial display. However, females spawned more with blue males than with yellow males, suggesting that expression of blue coloration is sexually more attractive. The ability to adjust color phenotype according to the local competitive environment could therefore promote the persistence of plastic changes in coloration. Our findings challenge the view that phenotypic plasticity sets the stage for the evolution of genetically fixed changes via sexual selection, and instead suggest that sexual selection may favor plasticity in sexual traits.",

    "abstract": "Predictive processing is quickly gaining ground as a theory of perception and attention. From this perspective the brain is cast as an organisms predictive model of how its world works and will continue to work in the future. However, research on the brains predictive capacities remains beholden to traditional research practices in which participants are passively shown stimuli without their active involvement. The current study is an investigation into ways in which self-generated predictions may differ from externally induced predictions. Participants completed a volatile spatial attention task under both conditions on different days. We used the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter, an approximate Bayesian inference model, to determine subject-specific parameters of belief-updating and inferred volatility. We found preliminary evidence in support of self-generated predictions incurring a larger reaction time cost when violated compared to predictions induced by sensory cue, which translated to participants increased sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility. Our results suggest that internally generated predictions may be afforded more weight, but these results are complicated by session order and duration effects, as well as a lack of statistical power. We discuss the limitations of our study preventing us from replicating previous research, and ways to remedy these shortcomings in future studies.",

Rare heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in GRIN2A, encoding a subunit of the NMDA (N-methyl-d-aspartate) receptor, greatly increase the risk of schizophrenia. By transcriptomic, proteomic, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and behavioral analysis, we report that heterozygous Grin2a mutant mice show: (i) large-scale gene expression changes across multiple brain regions and in neuronal (excitatory and inhibitory) and non-neuronal cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes); (ii) evidence of reduced activity in prefrontal cortex and increased activity in hippocampus and striatum; (iii) elevated dopamine signaling in striatum; (iv) altered cholesterol biosynthesis in astrocytes; (v) reduction of glutamatergic receptor signalin g proteins in the synapse; (iv) heightened gamma oscillation power in EEG; (vi) aberrant locomotor behavioral pattern opposite of that induced by antipsychotic drugs. These findings reveal potential pathophysiologic mechanisms, provide support for both the \"hypo-glutamate\" and \"hyper-dopamine\" hypotheses of schizophrenia, and underscore the utility of Grin2a-deficient mice as a new genetic model of schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCM), also known as cavernous angiomas, are blood vessel abnormalities comprised of clusters of grossly enlarged and hemorrhage-prone capillaries. The prevalence in the general population, including asymptomatic cases, is estimated to be 0.5%. Some patients develop severe symptoms, including seizures and focal neurologic deficits, while others have no symptoms. The causes of this remarkable presentation heterogeneity within a primarily monogenic disease remain poorly understood. To address this problem, we have established a chronic mouse model of CCM, induced by postnatal ablation of Krit1 with Pdgfb-CreERT. These mice develop CCM lesions gradually over 4-6 months of age throughout of the brain. We examined lesion progression in these mice with T2-weighted 7T MRI protocols. Precise volumetric analysis of individual lesions revealed non-monotonous behavior, with some lesions temporarily growing smaller. However, the cumulative lesional volume invariably increased over time and accelerated after about 3 months. Next, we established a modified protocol for dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) MR imaging and produced quantitative maps of gadolinium tracer MultiHance in the lesions, indicating a high degree of heterogeneity in lesional permeability. Multivariate comparisons of MRI properties of the lesions with cellular markers for endothelial cells, astrocytes, and microglia revealed that increased cell density surrounding lesions correlates with stability, while increased vasculature within and surrounding lesions may correlate with instability. Our results lay a foundation for better understanding individual lesion properties and provide a comprehensive pre-clinical platform for testing new drug and gene therapies for controlling CCM.",

    "abstract": "Neuronal maturation is a process that plays a key role in the development and regeneration of the central nervous system. Although embryonic brain development and neurodegeneration have received considerable attention, the events that govern postnatal neuronal maturation are less understood. Among the mechanisms influencing such neuronal maturation process, apoptosis plays a key role. Several regulators have been described to modulate apoptosis, including post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs. This study aimed to assess whether the strikingly induced miR-138-5p during neuronal maturation contributes to avoiding the neuronal death induced by apoptosis. Our results point out that the observed opposite expression of miR-138-5p and its target Caspase3 might modulate apoptosis favouring neuronal survival at distinct maturation stages. The unchanged expression of miR-138-5p in mature neurons contrasts with the significant downregulation in immature neurons upon apoptotic stimulation. Similarly, immunoblot and individual cellular assays confirmed that during maturation, not only the expression but processing of CASP-3 and caspase activity is reduced after apoptotic stimulation which resulted in a reduction of neuronal death. For all this data, we suggest that the upregulation of miR-138-5p during neuronal maturation is crucial in neuronal survival in pathological or traumatic conditions. Further studies would be needed to determine a more detailed role of miR-138-5p in apoptosis during neuronal maturation and the synergistic action of several microRNAs acting cooperatively on Caspase3 or other apoptotic targets.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516547v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1eb95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@31b0c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d895borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@74c902_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighligthsO_LINeuronal maturation promotes cell survival.\nC_LIO_LINeuronal maturation reduces the processing of CASP-3 and caspase activity after apoptotic stimulation.\nC_LIO_LIThe expression changes of miR-138-5p and Caspase 3 are opposite during hippocampal neuron maturation.\nC_LIO_LIThe increase of miR-138-5p expression throughout maturation is not influenced by apoptotic stimulation.\nC_LIO_LIMiR-138-5p is suggested as an essential factor concerning neuronal maturation, regulating Caspase 3 and favouring survival.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The angular gyrus (AG) is involved in multiple cognitive processes and its structural alterations are commonly observed in many neuropsychiatric syndromes. Since changes in excitability may precede structural changes and clinical symptoms, there is a need for diagnostic tools assessing the functional state of hub brain regions like the AG. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) can provide such functional readouts by probing the brain response to direct stimulation.\n\nThis study aimed to characterize TMS-evoked potentials (TEP) elicited by AG stimulation, determine optimal stimulation parameters, and identify TEP biomarkers of AG function. We recorded AG-TEPs in 19 subjects using four TMS orientations and three intensities and compared TEP spatiotemporal features using topographic dissimilarity and microstate analyses. Additionally, we explored the relationship between AG-TEP topography and TMS-evoked muscular activity.\n\nOur results showed topographic variability in AG-TEP components P25, N45, and N75. The P25 topography was sensitive to TMS orientation, while the topography of N45 and N75 was highly dependent on both coil orientation and intensity. Interestingly, we found that TMS-evoked muscular activity was also dependent on both these parameters and strongly related to the occurrence of a specific topographic pattern, which therefore possibly corresponds to the somatosensory brain response to muscle contraction.\n\nWe conclude that the early AG-TEP component P25 likely reflects neural processes triggered by direct AG activation and could provide an index of local excitability. Later components N45 and N75 must be interpreted with caution as they may primarily reflect peripherally evoked activity.",

The approach uses 2 generators and 2 discriminators to generate an image harmonized to a specific target dataset given an image from the source domain distribution and vice versa. We train the CycleGAN to jointly optimize an adversarial loss and cyclic consistency. We use a patch-based discriminator and impose identity loss to further regularize model training. To test the benefit of the harmonization, we show that brain age estimation - a common benchmarking task - is more accurate in GAN-harmonized versus raw data. t-SNE maps show the improved distributional overlap of the harmonized data in the latent space.",

However, which vessel subtypes and signaling pathways generate these aberrant vessels is poorly understood. Using single-cell RNA sequencing and in vivo validation, we find that transcriptome signatures of neo-angiogenesis arise in venous endothelial cells in both acute and chronic EAE, and correlate with upregulation in VEGF-A signaling. These neo-angiogenic markers are also increased in human MS lesions. Treatment with a VEGF-A blocking antibody ameliorates EAE pathology by reducing neo-angiogenic transcriptomic signatures in vivo, suggesting that VEGF-A drives angiogenesis from vein ECs in EAE.

However, dynamic changes in FC related to locomotion with sensory feedback remain unexplored. To investigate FC dynamics in locomoting mice, we developed mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging with a virtual reality (VR) environment. We find rapid reorganization of cortical FC in response to changing behavioral states. Using machine learning classification, behavioral states are accurately decoded. We then use our VR-based imaging system to study cortical FC in a mouse model of autism and find that locomotion states are associated with altered FC dynamics. Furthermore, we identify FC patterns involving the motor area as the most distinguishing features of the autism mice from wild-type mice during behavioral transitions, which might correlate with motor clumsiness in patients with autism. Our VR-based real-time imaging system provides invaluable information to understand FC dynamics linked to a behavioral abnormality of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Generative models are widely used in modeling sequences from language to birdsong. Here we show that a statistical test designed to guard against overgeneralization of a model in generating sequences can be used to infer minimal models for the variable syllable sequences of Bengalese finch songs. Specifically, the generative model we consider is the partially observable Markov model (POMM). A POMM consists of states and probabilistic transitions between them. Each state is associated with a syllable, and one syllable can be associated with multiple states. This multiplicity of association from syllable to states distinguishes a POMM from a simple Markov model, in which one syllable is associated with one state. The multiplicity indicates that syllable transitions are context-dependent. The statistical test is used to infer a POMM with minimal number of states from a finite number of observed sequences. We apply the method to infer POMMs for songs of six adult male Bengalese finches before and shortly after deafening, and show that auditory feedback plays an important role in creating context-dependent syllable transitions in Bengalese finch songs.\n\nAuthor SummaryLarge language models, such as the one underlying ChatGPT, are probabilistic generative models that can capture context-dependent sequencing of words. We show that a probabilistic model inspired by how the brain encodes song production in songbirds can accurately capture context-dependent syllable transitions in the songs of Bengalese finches. The models reveal that deafening reduces the context dependencies, suggesting that auditory feedback plays a significant role in creating such dependencies in Bengalese finch songs. Our approach can be applied to other behavioral sequences and help to understand the neural mechanisms underlying statistical regularities in the sequences.",

These complex attributes contribute to the difficulties in the success of TBI therapeutic regimens. Previously, we showed the spatiotemporal effects of TBI as well as the ability of T4 administration to prevent the cognitive impairments induced by TBI. Here, we focus on understanding the mechanism involved in the ability of T4 to prevent the cognitive damage induced by TBI using a systems level approach. Using single cell sequencing of two tissues (hippocampus and frontal cortex) at three stages post injury, we identified astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and endothelial cells to be the most affected across both tissues and across timepoints after T4 treatment. We also identified key genes that were reversed after T4 treatment such as Mbp and Plp1. Oxidative phosphorylation, immune response, and nervous system related pathways were shown to be affected by T4 treatment. Our systems-level approach allows us to further understand the temporal and spatial dynamic reprogramming by T4 that prevents cognitive dysfunction induced by TBI.",

    "abstract": "Psilocin, the active compound in Psilocybe sp. mushrooms, is a serotonergic psychedelic that has recently gained renewed interest due to its potential as a therapeutic tool. Despite promising clinical findings, the underlying signaling mechanisms and brain region-specific effects of psilocin and other psychedelic drugs remain unclear. Psilocin, like other psychedelic compounds, is an agonist at many serotonin and other biogenic amine receptors; however, activation of serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT) 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) is understood as the main molecular target for the psychoactive effects in animals and humans. 5-HT2ARs are abundantly expressed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC); however, the biochemical actions of psilocin on PFC neurons remain poorly understood. In this study, we used in vitro slice electrophysiology to examine how psilocin acutely alters the activity and electrophysiological properties of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse PFC. Focal application of psilocin (10M) onto nonspecified Layer 5 Pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic PFC of C57BL/6J mice produced variable effects on firing (increase, decrease, or no change). 5-HT2AR layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the mouse prelimbic PFC were identified via labeling in a 5-HT2A-ERT2-Cre mouse crossed with an Ai9 tdTomato reporter. Focal application of psilocin increased firing in all identified 5-HT2AR neurons but did not result in any significant changes in synaptic transmission. Overall, the results demonstrate that psilocin evokes strong firing changes in the PFC that are 5-HT2AR and Gq dependent, thereby providing valuable insights into the effects of psilocin on a brain region implicated in mediating psychedelic drug actions.",

    "abstract": "Background and motivationBrain rhythms have been postulated to play central roles in animal cognition. A prominently reported dichotomy of hippocampal rhythms, driven primarily by historic single-strata recordings, assigns theta-frequency oscillations (4-12 Hz) and ripples (120-250 Hz) to be exclusively associated with preparatory and consummatory behaviors, respectively. However, due to the differential power expression of these two signals across hippocampal strata, reports of such exclusivity require validation through simultaneous multi-strata recordings and cross-strata analysis of these oscillatory patterns.\n\nMethodologyWe assessed co-occurrence of theta-frequency oscillations with ripples in multi-channel recordings of extracellular potentials across hippocampal strata from foraging rats. We detected all ripple events from an identified stratum pyramidale (SP) channel based on rigorous thresholds relating to the spectro-temporal and spatial characteristics of ripples. We then defined theta epochs based on theta oscillations detected from each of the different channels spanning the SP to the stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM) through the stratum radiatum (SR). We calculated the proportion of ripples embedded within theta epochs.\n\nResultsWe found [~]20% (across rats) of ripple events (in SP) to co-occur with theta epochs identified from SR/SLM channels, defined here as theta ripples. All characteristics of theta ripples were comparable with ripples that occurred in the absence of theta oscillations. Furthermore, the power of theta oscillations in the immediate vicinity of theta ripples was similar to theta power across identified theta epochs, together validating the identification process of theta ripples. Strikingly, when theta epochs were instead identified from the SP channel, such co-occurrences were significantly lower in number. The reduction in the number of theta ripples was consequent to progressive reduction in theta power along the SLM-SR-SP axis. We assessed the behavioral state of rats during ripple events and found most theta ripples to occur during immobile periods. We confirmed that across sessions and rats, the theta power observed during exploratory theta epochs was comparable with theta power during immobile theta epochs. In addition, the progressive reduction in theta power along the SLM-SR-SP axis was common to both exploratory and immobile periods. Finally, we found a strong theta-phase preference of theta ripples within the third quadrant [3{pi}/2-2{pi}] of the associated theta oscillation.\n\nImplicationsOur analyses provide direct quantitative evidence for the occurrence of ripple events nested within theta oscillations in the rodent hippocampus. These analyses emphasize that the prevalent dichotomy about the manifestation of theta-frequency oscillations and ripples needs to be reevaluated, after explicitly accounting for the differential stratum-dependent expression of these two oscillatory patterns. The prevalence of theta ripples expands the potential roles of ripple-frequency oscillations to span the continuum of encoding, retrieval, and consolidation, achieved through interactions with theta oscillations.",

    "abstract": "1H Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) is an important non-invasive tool for measuring brain metabolism, with numerous applications in the neuroscientific and clinical domains. In this work we present a new analysis pipeline (SLIPMAT), designed to extract high-quality, tissue-specific, spectral profiles from MR spectroscopic imaging data (MRSI). Spectral decomposition is combined with spatially dependant frequency and phase correction to yield high SNR white and grey matter spectra without partial-volume contamination. A subsequent series of spectral processing steps are applied to reduce unwanted spectral variation, such as baseline correction and linewidth matching, before direct spectral analysis with machine learning and traditional statistical methods. The method is validated using a 2D semi-LASER MRSI sequence, with a 5-minute duration, from data acquired in triplicate across 8 healthy participants. Reliable spectral profiles are confirmed with principal component analysis, revealing the importance of total-choline and scyllo-inositol levels in distinguishing between individuals - in good agreement with our previous work. Furthermore, since the method allows the simultaneous measurement of metabolites in grey and white matter, we show the strong discriminative value of these metabolites in both tissue types for the first time. In conclusion, we present a novel and time efficient MRSI acquisition and processing pipeline, capable of detecting reliable neuro-metabolic differences between healthy individuals, and suitable for the sensitive neurometabolic profiling of in-vivo brain tissue.",

However, light of the same spectral composition viewed over a large field under normal viewing conditions looks invariably green and highly saturated. It remains unknown what stimulus parameters are most important for governing the color appearance in the transition between these two extreme cases. The current study varied the size, intensity and retinal motion of stimuli presented in an adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope. Stimuli were either stabilized on target locations or allowed to drift across the retina with the eyes natural motion. Increasing both stimulus size and intensity led to higher likelihoods that monochromatic spots of light were perceived as green, while only higher intensities led to increases in perceived saturation. The data also show an interaction between size and intensity, suggesting that the balance between magnocellular and parvocellular activation may be critical factors for color perception.\n\nSurprisingly, under the range of conditions tested, color appearance did not depend on whether stimuli were stabilized or not. Sequential activation of many cones does not appear to drive hue and saturation perception as effectively as simultaneous activation of many cones.",

    "abstract": "The waking brains ubiquitous alpha oscillations are thought to play an important role in managing the brains resources, inhibiting neural activity as a function of their phase and amplitude. In accordance with this physiological excitability, perceptual and cognitive processes fluctuate with alpha oscillations. Here we demonstrate that the alpha rhythm can be manipulated with sound in a phase-dependent manner, showing that repeated phase-locked sounds alter the frequency of these oscillations in a spatially localised manner. We draw on oscillator theory to explore the origin of this frequency change, using phase-locked auditory evoked potentials to show a putative phase-reset mechanism, which is dependent on the amplitude of the endogenous alpha oscillations. Finally, we demonstrate the functional relevance of this approach by showing that we can modulate the transition to sleep, using sound, in an alpha phase-dependent manner. Overall, we conclude that the phase of alpha oscillations can be exploited in real-time, and highlight alpha phase-locked auditory stimulation as a powerful method by which to both selectively augment and investigate the brains pertinent oscillations.",

Bimanual motor control has been mostly studied during continuous repetitive tasks, while little research has been carried out in experimental settings requiring dynamic changes in motor output generated by both hands. Here, we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) while healthy volunteers performed a visually guided, bimanual pinch force task. This enabled us to map functional activity and connectivity of premotor and motor areas during bimanual pinch force control in different task contexts, requiring mirror-symmetric or inverse-asymmetric changes in discrete pinch force exerted with the right and left hand. The bilateral dorsal premotor cortex showed increased activity and effective coupling to the ipsilateral supplementary motor area (SMA) in the inverse-asymmetric context compared to the mirror-symmetric context of bimanual pitch force control. Compared to unilateral pinches, all bimanual pinch force conditions were characterized by an increased level of activation in the bilateral primary motor hand area (M1-HAND) and stronger coupling from SMA to the ipsilateral M1-HAND. Task-related activity of a cluster in the left caudal SMA scaled positively with the degree of synchronous initiation of bilateral pinch force adjustments, irrespectively of the task context. The results suggest that the dorsal premotor cortex mediates increasing complexity of bimanual coordination by increasing coupling to the SMA-M1 network.",

    "abstract": "Humans and nonhuman animals derive value from many different sources. Some of these sources, notably primary reinforcers like food, are clearly rewarding and can powerfully shape our behaviors. Other sources of reward, such as information, are more intangible and abstract. Like humans, nonhuman primates also find information inherently rewarding, displaying a preference to reveal information about upcoming primary reinforcers even though the information has no bearing on the outcome itself. For animals living in social groups, the need for information extends beyond primary reinforcers like food. They need to acquire information from others or about others. This is especially true for animals, such as nonhuman primates, which live in large and often hierarchically organized societies, where processing social information for the purpose of learning and socializing can be just as critical to survival. To quantify curiosity for knowing social information in monkeys, we extend the advanced informationseeking paradigm (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009) into the realm of abstract, social information. We first replicated the finding that monkeys prefer advanced information about juice size (Bromberg-Martin and Hikosaka, 2009). We next trained monkeys on a social variant of this task. In the advanced social information-seeking task, monkeys had the option to choose a cue that tells them in advance the valence, or facial expression, on a monkeys face that they will be viewing before receiving the invariant amount of juice. Even though this cue did not impact which facial expression the monkeys would see, they preferred to know the valence of the facial expression in advance. Our results indicate that information-seeking behavior generalizes to seeking social information. Our findings also suggest that curiosity in nonhuman primates can be translated into increasingly abstract levels of information.",

The internal taste sensilla, situated in the pharynx, evaluate the suitability of the ingested food. Here, through multiple approaches, we characterized the pharyngeal organ (PO) of the hematophagous kissing bug Rhodnius prolixus to determine its role in food assessment. The PO, located antero-dorsally in the pharynx, comprises 8 taste sensilla that become bathed with the incoming blood.\n\nResultsWe showed that these taste sensilla house gustatory receptor neurons projecting their axons through the labral nerves to reach the subesophageal zone in the brain. We found that these neurons are electrically activated by relevant appetitive and aversive gustatory stimuli such as NaCl, ATP and caffeine. Using RNA-Seq, we examined the expression of sensory-related gene families in the PO. We identified gustatory receptors, ionotropic receptors, transient receptor potential channels, pickpocket channels, opsins, takeouts, neuropeptide precursors, neuropeptide receptors and biogenic amine receptors. RNA interference assays demonstrated that the pickpocket channel Rproppk014276 is necessary for salt detection during feeding.\n\nConclusionWe provide evidence of the role of the pharyngeal organ in food evaluation. This work shows the first comprehensive characterization of a pharyngeal taste organ in a hematophagous insect.",

    "abstract": "Synucleinopathies such as Parkinsons disease (PD) are characterized by pathologic production, aggregation, and cell-to-cell transmission of -synuclein (-syn) protein that results in impaired cellular function. While neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta express high levels of -synuclein and are highly vulnerable to its aberrant expression or conformation, brain-resident macrophages (microglia) are also sensitive to abnormal -synuclein, with recent reports indicating that elevated levels impair phagocytic ability in vivo and in vitro. To explore the impact of elevated -syn on microglial function we employed a co-culture model containing iPSC-derived neurons and microglia-like cells. iPSCs from healthy control donors and a Parkinsons donor with an allelic triplication of the SNCA gene locus were differentiated into neurons and microglia-like cells. In monoculture, neurons and microglia generated from the SNCA triplication donor expressed higher levels of SNCA transcript and protein. Neurons were found to have significantly greater expression of SNCA compared to microglia, regardless of donor genotype. Co-cultures of neurons and microglia revealed that microglia cultured with SNCA triplication neurons displayed reduction in phagocytosis of fluorescent E. coli, irrespective of microglia donor genotype. SNCA mRNA and protein expression could be reduced with treatment with an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeting SNCA. ASO treatment partially rescued microglia phagocytosis in SNCA triplication co-cultures and in co-cultures containing SNCA triplication neurons and healthy control microglia. Our results complement and extend previous findings of impaired microglial function in the presence of elevated -synuclein in a novel patient-derived co-culture model that utilizes more disease-relevant conditions rather than the relaying on the addition of exogenous -synuclein.",

    "abstract": "The disruption of cortical assembly activity has been associated with anesthesia-induced loss of consciousness. However, information about the relationship between cortical assembly activity and the variations in consciousness associated with natural vigilance states is currently lacking. To address this, we performed vigilance state-specific clustering analysis on 2-photon calcium imaging data from sensorimotor cortex in combination with global EEG microstate analysis derived from multi-EEG signals obtained from widespread cortical locations. Our analysis revealed no difference in the structure of assembly activity during quiet wakefulness (QW), NREMs, or REMs, despite the latter two vigilance states being associated with significantly reduced levels of consciousness relative to QW. However, we found a significant coordination between global EEG microstate dynamics and local cortical assembly activity during periods of QW, but not sleep. These results suggest that the coordination of cortical assembly activity with global brain dynamics could be a key factor of sustained conscious experience.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in the locus coeruleus (LC) is a ubiquitous feature of prodromal Alzheimers disease (AD), and LC neurons degenerate as AD progresses. Tau-mediated LC dysfunction may contribute to early neuropsychiatric symptoms, while loss of LC integrity is associated with conversion to cognitive impairment. Hyperphosphorylated tau alters firing rates in other brain regions, but its effects on LC neurons have not been described. The purpose of this study was to characterize changes in firing properties of LC neurons when they are the only cells containing hyperphosphorylated tau, as well as later in disease when {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) and tau pathology is abundant in the forebrain. Single unit LC activity was recorded from anesthetized wild-type (WT) and TgF344-AD rats, which carry the APP/PS1 transgene. Similar to human AD, these rats develop hyperphosphorylated tau in the LC (at 6 months) prior to A{beta} or tau pathology in forebrain regions (at 12-15 months). At baseline, LC neurons from TgF344-AD rats were hypoactive at both ages compared to WT littermates, but showed elevated spontaneous bursting properties, particularly in younger animals. Differences in footshock-evoked LC firing depended on age, with 6-month TgF344-AD rats demonstrating aspects of hyperactivity, and aged transgenic rats showing hypoactivity relative to WT. Tau-induced alterations in LC firing rates may contribute to the pathophysiology of AD, with early hyperactivity associated with prodromal symptoms, followed by hypoactivity contributing to cognitive impairment. These results support further investigation into disease stage-dependent noradrenergic interventions for AD.\n\nHighlightsO_LIRecorded locus coeruleus (LC) neurons in a rat model of Alzheimers disease (AD)\nC_LIO_LITgF344-AD rats develop early endogenous LC tau pathology akin to human AD\nC_LIO_LI6- and 15-month TgF344-AD rats had reduced tonic LC firing\nC_LIO_LILC neurons from 6-month TgF344-AD rats were hyperactive in response to footshock\nC_LIO_LILC neuron dysfunction may contribute to AD symptoms\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Viewpoint effects on object recognition interact with object-scene consistency effects. While recognition of objects seen from \"accidental\" viewpoints (e.g., a cup from below) is typically impeded compared to processing of objects seen from canonical viewpoints (e.g., the string-side of a guitar), this effect is reduced by meaningful scene context information. In the present study we investigated if these findings established by using photographic images, generalise to 3D models of objects. Using 3D models further allowed us to probe a broad range of viewpoints and empirically establish accidental and canonical viewpoints. In Experiment 1, we presented 3D models of objects from six different viewpoints (0{degrees}, 60{degrees}, 120{degrees}, 180{degrees} 240{degrees}, 300{degrees}) in colour (1a) and grayscaled (1b) in a sequential matching task. Viewpoint had a significant effect on accuracy and response times. Based on the performance in Experiments 1a and 1b, we determined canonical (0{degrees}-rotation) and non-canonical (120{degrees}-rotation) viewpoints for the stimuli. In Experiment 2, participants again performed a sequential matching task, however now the objects were paired with scene backgrounds which could be either consistent (e.g., a cup in the kitchen) or inconsistent (e.g., a guitar in the bathroom) to the object. Viewpoint interacted significantly with scene consistency in that object recognition was less affected by viewpoint when consistent scene information was provided, compared to inconsistent information. Our results show that viewpoint-dependence and scene context effects generalize to depth rotated 3D objects. This supports the important role object-scene processing plays for object constancy.",
