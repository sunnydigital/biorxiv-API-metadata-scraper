    "abstract": "IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells, often referred to as Tc17 cells, have been identified at sites of inflammation in several immune-mediated inflammatory diseases including psoriasis and spondyloarthritis. Whilst much of our understanding of IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells has been discerned from murine studies, human IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells remain less-well characterised. We optimised an in vitro polarisation protocol to expand human IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells from PBMC or bulk CD8+ T-cell populations for phenotypic and functional assessment. We show that T-cell activation in the presence of IL-1{beta} and IL-23 significantly increased the frequencies of IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells, which was not further enhanced by the addition of IL-6, IL-2 or anti-IFN{gamma} mAb. In vitro-generated IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells from healthy donors displayed a distinct type-17 profile compared with IL-17A- CD8+ T-cells, as defined by transcriptional signature (IL17A, IL17F, RORC, RORA, MAF, IL23R, CCR6, CXCR6); high surface expression of CCR6 and CD161; and polyfunctional production of IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IFN{gamma}, TNF and GM-CSF. A significant proportion of in vitro-induced IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells expressed TCRV7.2 and bound MR1 tetramers, indicative of a MAIT CD8+ T-cell population. Using an IL-17A secretion assay, we demonstrate that the in vitro-generated IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells were biologically functional and induced pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-8 production by synovial fibroblasts from patients with psoriatic arthritis. Collectively, we report an in vitro culture system to expand IL-17A+ CD8+ T-cells and further characterise their phenotype, transcriptional regulation and functional relevance to human health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The Setophaga warbler sister species in western North America, Setophaga occidentalis and S. townsendi provide a rare opportunity to explore how the accumulation of genetic barriers to gene flow contributes to speciation. These sister species are at the very early stages of speciation, as their genome-wide divergence is limited, and they hybridize extensively upon secondary contact. However, there are several well-characterized loci involved in speciation. There is a plumage difference between the species controlled by mutations close to the agouti signaling protein (ASIP), which generates underdominance due to compromised hybrid territorial signaling. A second large region (~2Mb) on chromosome 5 encodes many mitochondrial-interacting genes and coevolves with the mitochondrial genome. Here we reconstructed the ancestral recombination graphs of these genomic regions relative to the genome-wide background to learn about the evolutionary history of these barriers. We find signatures of long-lasting barrier effects that lasted for ~190 K generations, and recent selective sweeps in chr5 mitonuclear genetic block in both species within the past 60 K generations ago. We further observed heterogeneity within the long-lasting mitonuclear barrier with localized signals of much more recent selective sweeps unique one of the species. The divergence of ASIP is elevated by a species-specific selective sweep within S. occidentalis that occurred 21 K generations ago. However, the signature of long-lasting barrier effect is much weaker at ASIP suggesting that it may have arisen later than the mitonuclear system. Associating the evolutionary history of these genetic barriers with Pleistocene climate change history sheds light on the intrinsic and extrinsic reciprocity underlying the origin of species.",

    "abstract": "Diet elicits varied effects on longevity across a wide range of animal species. For example, diets low in protein and high in carbohydrate typically extend lifespan while diets high in protein tend to reduce it. Although studies have also shown that diet-induced lifespan changes can persist through transgenerational plasticity, whether such changes lead to evolutionary shifts in lifespan remains unclear. In this study we combine experimental evolution and phenotypic plasticity assays to address this gap. Using Drosophila serrata, we investigated the evolutionary potential of lifespan in response to four novel diets spanning a carbohydrate-protein gradient. We also examined developmental plasticity effects using a set of control populations that were raised on the four novel environments. Our results show that although lifespan evolved in response to changes in dietary carbohydrate concentration, the plastic responses for lifespan differed from the evolved responses. The direction of the evolved response (increased lifespan) observed on low carbohydrate diets was in the opposite direction to the plastic response (decreased lifespan). Our results imply that plastic responses to low carbohydrates can be maladaptive for lifespan and misaligned with the evolved responses, laying the groundwork for future investigations of carbohydrate contributions to evolved and plastic effects on lifespan.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a major risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD), and cell-type vulnerability underlies its characteristic clinical manifestations. We have performed longitudinal, single-cell RNA-sequencing in Drosophila with pan-neuronal expression of human tau, which forms AD neurofibrillary tangle pathology. Whereas tau- and aging-induced gene expression strongly overlap (93%), they differ in the affected cell types. In contrast to the broad impact of aging, tau-triggered changes are strongly polarized to excitatory neurons and glia. Further, tau can either activate or suppress innate immune gene expression signatures in a cell type-specific manner. Integration of cellular abundance and gene expression pinpoints Nuclear Factor Kappa B signaling as a potential marker for neuronal vulnerability. We also highlight the conservation of cell type-specific transcriptional patterns between Drosophila and human postmortem brain tissue. Overall, our results create a resource for dissection of dynamic, age-dependent gene expression changes at cellular resolution in a genetically tractable model of tauopathy.",

We herein developed an engineering strategy for IsPETase to enhance PET hydrolysis activity, thermostability, and protein folding of the enzyme. Balance-directed Z1-PETase variant outperforms the stability-directed Z2-PETase variant under both mesophilic and thermophilic conditions, although Z2-PETase exhibits higher thermostability than Z1-PETase. The Z1-PETase is also superior to Fast-PETase, Dura-PETase, and LC-CICCG in terms of depolymerization rate regardless of temperature conditions we tested. Thus, maintaining a balance between PET hydrolysis activity and thermostability is essential for the development of high-performance PET hydrolases. In a pH-stat bioreactor, Z1-PETase depolymerized >90% of both transparent and colored post-consumer PET powders within 24 and 8 hours at 40{degrees}C and 55{degrees}C, respectively, demonstrating that the balance-directed IsPETase variant produced herein may be applicable in the bio-recycling of PET.",

    "abstract": "High-throughput sequencing technology is central to our current understanding of the human methylome. The vast majority of studies use chemical conversion to analyse bulk-level patterns of DNA methylation across the genome from a population of cells. While this technology has been used to probe single-molecule methylation patterns, such analyses are limited to short reads of a few hundred basepairs. DNA methylation can also be directly detected using Nanopore sequencing which can generate reads measuring megabases in length. However, thus far these analyses have largely focused on bulk-level assessment of DNA methylation. Here, we analyse DNA methylation in single Nanopore reads with a mean length of 24.6kb, to show that bulk-level metrics underestimate large-scale heterogeneity in the methylome. We use the correlation in methylation state between neighbouring sites to quantify single-molecule heterogeneity and find that heterogeneity varies significantly across the human genome, with some regions having heterogeneous methylation patterns at the single-molecule level and others possessing more homogeneous methylation patterns. By comparing the genomic distribution of the correlation to epigenomic annotations, we find that the greatest heterogeneity in single-molecule patterns is observed within heterochromatic partially methylated domains (PMDs). In contrast, reads originating from euchromatic regions and gene bodies have more ordered DNA methylation patterns. By analysing the patterns of single molecules in more detail, we show the existence of a 185bp periodicity in DNA methylation that accounts for some of the heterogeneity we uncover in long single-molecule DNA methylation patterns. We find that this periodic structure is partially masked in bulk data in a manner that is consistent with imperfect phasing of nucleosomes between molecules. Our findings demonstrate the power of single-molecule analysis of long-read data to understand the structure of the human methylome.",

    "abstract": "Pangenomics is the study of related genomes collectively, usually from the same species or closely related taxa. Originally, pangenomes were defined for bacterial species. After the concept was extended to eukaryotic genomes, two definitions of pangenome evolved in parallel: the gene-based approach, which defines the pangenome as the union of all genes, and the sequence-based approach, which defines the pangenome as the set of all nonredundant genomic sequences.\n\nEstimating the total size of the pangenome for a given species has been subject of study since the very first mention of pangenomes. Traditionally, this is performed by predicting the ratio at which new genes are discovered, referred to as the openness of the species.\n\nHere, we abstract each genome as a set of items, which is entirely agnostic of the two approaches (gene-based, sequence-based). Genes are a viable option for items, but also other possibilities are feasible, e.g., genome sequence substrings of fixed length k (k-mers).\n\nIn the present study, we investigate the use of k-mers to estimate the openness as an alternative to genes, and compare the results. An efficient implementation is also provided.",

In vivo chemoresistant xenograft models, an unbiased genome-wide transcriptome analysis, and a patient data/tissue analysis all showed that chemoresistance arose from failed epigenetic control of the nuclear protein-1 (NUPR1)/histone deacetylase 11 (HDAC11) axis, and high Nupr1 expression correlated with poor clinical outcomes.

This general regression presents several good indexes of quality, high correlation (R2 = 0.98), lower values of percent predicted error (%PE = 0.01), and the standard error of the estimate (%SEE = 25), showing that is a good tool, as the predicted values are similar to those observed.

    "abstract": "Adaptive immune responses are induced by vaccination and infection, yet little is known about how CD4+ T cell memory differs when primed in these two contexts. Notably, viral infection is generally associated with higher levels of systemic inflammation than is vaccination. To assess whether the inflammatory milieu at the time of CD4+ T cell priming has long-term effects on memory, we compared Spike-specific memory CD4+ T cells in 22 individuals around the time of the participants third SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination, with stratification by whether the participants first exposure to Spike was via virus or mRNA vaccine. Multimodal single-cell profiling of Spike-specific CD4+ T cells revealed 755 differentially expressed genes that distinguished infection- and vaccine-primed memory CD4+ T cells. Spike-specific CD4+ T cells from infection-primed individuals had strong enrichment for cytotoxicity and interferon signaling genes, whereas Spike-specific CD4+ T cells from vaccine-primed individuals were enriched for proliferative pathways by gene set enrichment analysis. Moreover, Spike-specific memory CD4+ T cells established by infection had distinct epigenetic landscapes driven by enrichment of IRF-family transcription factors, relative to T cells established by mRNA vaccination. This transcriptional imprint was minimally altered following subsequent mRNA vaccination or breakthrough infection, reflecting the strong bias induced by the inflammatory environment during initial memory differentiation. Together, these data suggest that the inflammatory context during CD4+ T cell priming is durably imprinted in the memory state at transcriptional and epigenetic levels, which has implications for personalization of vaccination based on prior infection history.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 infection versus SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination prime durable transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct Spike-specific CD4+ T cell memory landscapes.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic made evident that we count with few coronavirus-fighting drugs. Here we aimed to identify a cost-effective antiviral with broad spectrum activity and high safety and tolerability profiles. We began elaborating a list of 116 drugs previously used to treat other pathologies or characterized in pre-clinical studies with potential to treat coronavirus infections. We next employed molecular modelling tools to rank the 44 most promising inhibitors and tested their efficacy as antivirals against a panel of  and {beta} coronavirus, e.g., the HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Four drugs, OSW-1, U18666A, hydroxypropyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (H{beta}CD) and phytol, showed antiviral activity against both HCoV-229E (in MRC5 cells) and SARS-CoV-2 (in Vero E6 cells). The mechanism of action of these compounds was studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and by testing their capacity to inhibit the entry of SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses in ACE2-expressing HEK-293T cells. The entry was inhibited by H{beta}CD and U18666A, yet only H{beta}CD could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in the pulmonary cells Calu-3. With these results and given that cyclodextrins are widely used for drug encapsulation and can be safely administered to humans, we further tested 6 native and modified cyclodextrins, which confirmed {beta}-cyclodextrins as the most potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 cells. All accumulated data points to {beta}-cyclodextrins as promising candidates to be used in the therapeutic treatments for SARS-CoV-2 and possibly other respiratory viruses.",

    "abstract": "Ventricular remodeling is one of the primary adaptive mechanisms in response to long-term mechanical overload in diabetes. In addition to cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, alterations in noncardiomyocyte compartments [e.g. extracellular matrix (ECM)] are an essential process in the remodeling of ventricle during diabetes. Integrins that link the ECM and intracellular cytoskeleton function as mechanotransducers to translate the mechanical force to intracellular signals. We hypothesize that mechanotransduction mechanisms are altered in diabetic cardiomyopathy mouse hearts. To test this hypothesis, force and intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) measurements on papillary muscle fibers were investigated in adult mouse cardiomyocytes from normal (non-db) and type 2 diabetic (db/db) mice. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to measure adhesion force between integrin receptors and ECM protein fibronectin (FN) by quantifying the unbinding force required to break FN-cardiomyocytes (integrin) bonds. In db/db mice, the peak active force decreased at 71% or 73% while the peak of [Ca2+]i decreased at 64% and 68% at 1 Hz or 2 Hz. In the presence of the FN (35 nM), active force was increased significantly by 40-50% in db/db mice. Furthermore, increased active force in the presence of FN was associated with 26-42% increase in [Ca2+]i at all giving stimulations of 1 Hz and 2 Hz in db/db mice, respectively. The increased effects on force and [Ca2+]i caused by FN were greater in ventricular muscles from db/db mice than from non-db mice. The unbinding force between FN (2.7 M) coated AFM probes and cardiomyocyte in db/db was 52% higher than non-db (58.3 {+/-} 0.3 pN vs 38.6 {+/-} 0.9 pN. p < 0.05). The binding probability of FN-cardiomyocytes, calculated as number of force curves with adhesion / number of total force curves sampled, was significantly reduced by 30% in db/db cardiomyocytes when compared to normal. In addition, the cell stiffness, representing changes in Ca2+ signaling and cytoskeletal reorganization, was 19% increase in db/db cardiomyocytes. The presented data indicate that dynamic changes of the mechanical properties of integrin-ECM interactions may contribute to impaired intracellular Ca2+ signaling and myofilament activation in the diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYThe ability for animals to adapt their behaviors to specific environments is imperative to increase their evolutionary success. This is particularly true for behaviors such as parental behaviors that directly affect reproductive fitness. Here, we identified an oviposition behavior in the nematode C. elegans that increases the survival of the young. In standard laboratory culture, the bacterivorous hermaphrodite mothers lay eggs across a 2D E. coli lawn with no discernable pattern. However, in 3D culture they display a stereotypical behavior in which they temporarily leave the bacteria to lay eggs far away from the E. coli colony, resulting in a scattered ring of eggs located outside the bacteria. This oviposition behavior requires low oxygen levels and is regulated by the neuropeptide FLP-17 and its cognate receptor EGL-6. We confirm that a circuitry involving the oxygen-sensing BAG neurons and the vulva muscle-controlling HSN motor neurons regulates oviposition behavior. We show that loss of proper oviposition behavior results in lower reproductive fitness for the mothers and embryonic lethality for the eggs laid in bacteria under hypoxic conditions. Finally, we show that the degree of oviposition behavior varies among wild strains of C. elegans found in nature. The ability for C. elegans mothers to sense their environments and adjust their behaviors in adverse conditions is likely an adaptation that has allowed the worm to thrive in diverse and often hazardous habitats.",

These projection patterns are traditionally considered to originate from discrete thalamic nuclei, however recent work showing gradients of molecular and connectivity features in the thalamus suggests the organisation of thalamocortical connections occurs along a continuous dimension. By performing a joint decomposition of densely sampled gene expression and non-invasive diffusion tractography in the adult human thalamus, we define a principal axis of genetic and connectomic variation along a medial-lateral thalamic gradient. Projections along this axis correspond to an anterior-posterior cortical pattern and are aligned with electrophysiological properties of the cortex. The medial-lateral axis demonstrates phylogenetic conservation, reflects transitions in neuronal subtypes, and shows associations with neurodevelopment and common brain disorders. This study provides evidence for a supra-nuclear axis of thalamocortical organisation characterised by a graded transition in molecular properties and anatomical connectivity.",

Connectome gradients are a new tool representing brain functional topological organization in a low-dimensional space to smoothly capture the human macroscale hierarchy.\n\nMethodsHere, we examined altered topological organization in aMCI and AD by connectome gradient mapping. We further quantified functional segregation by gradient dispersion. Then, we systematically compared the alterations observed in aMCI and AD patients with those in normal controls (NCs) in a two-dimensional functional gradient space from both the whole-brain level and module level.\n\nResultsCompared with NCs, the first gradient, which described the neocortical hierarchy from unimodal to transmodal regions, showed a distributed and significant suppression in AD patients, while abnormalities were only limited to local regions in aMCI patients. The second gradient showed a decreased pattern in the somatomotor module in both aMCI and AD patients. Furthermore, gradient dispersion showed significant decreases in AD patients at both the global level and module level, whereas this alteration was limited only to limbic areas in aMCI. Notably, we demonstrated that suppressed gradient dispersion in aMCI and AD patients was associated with cognitive scores.\n\nConclusionsChanges in functional gradients could reflect different degrees of altered brain network segregation in aMCI and AD. These findings provide new evidence for altered brain hierarchy in aMCI and AD, which strengthens our understanding of the progressive mechanism of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "Chemical synaptic transmission relies on neurotransmitter release from presynaptic release sites and on transmitter-sensing by the postsynaptic cell. Presynaptic plasticity increasing neurotransmitter release achieves two fundamental nervous system functions: It tunes some synapses to be more responsive to millisecond repetitive activation and it maintains signals when postsynaptic transmitter sensitivity is reduced. How enhanced neurotransmitter release is achieved in these phenomena, termed short-term facilitation and homeostatic potentiation, remains unknown. We combine mathematical modeling and experimental analysis of Drosophila neuromuscular junction model synapses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying these forms of plasticity. Our results indicate that both phenomena depend on a rapid increase in the participation of neurotransmitter release sites which is controlled by the regulatory domains of the evolutionarily conserved (M)Unc13A protein that bind Ca2+/Calmodulin and diacylglycerol. Mutation of the Calmodulin binding (CaM) domain increased baseline transmission and impaired both short-term facilitation and acute homeostatic potentiation. Mathematical modeling indicated that these defects result from too many release sites participating at rest combined with the inability to plastically further increase their number. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that this coincided with a redistribution of Unc13As functionally essential MUN domain closer to the synaptic plasma membrane, which may constitute the molecular switch to increase release site participation. Similar consequences (enhanced baseline transmission, block of both short-term facilitation and homeostatic potentiation) were caused by the acute pharmacological activation of the C1 domain of wildtype Unc13A using phorbol esters. This treatment had no effect on Unc13A CaM domain mutants, indicating that both the CaM and C1 domains activate a binary release site switch. Thus, our findings indicate that Unc13A regulatory domains are tuned to integrate a multitude of signals on various timescales to switch release site participation for synaptic plasticity.",

The mechanisms by which the brain simultaneously encodes multiple task-relevant variables while minimizing interference from task-irrelevant features remain unknown. Leveraging intracranial recordings from the human PFC, we first demonstrate that competition between co-existing representations of past and present task variables incurs a behavioral switch cost. Our results reveal that this interference between past and present states in the PFC is resolved through coding partitioning into distinct low-dimensional neural states; thereby strongly attenuating behavioral switch costs.

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been increasingly utilized in mice. Due to the non-negligible effects of anesthetics on mouse fMRI, it is becoming more common to perform fMRI in the awake mice. However, high stress level and head motion in awake mouse fMRI remain to be fully addressed, which limits its practical applications. Therefore, here we presented a systematically optimized awake mouse fMRI paradigm as a practical and open-source solution. First, we designed a soundproof habituation chamber in which multiple mice can be habituated simultaneously and independently. Then, combining corticosterone, body weight and behavioral measurements, we systematically evaluated the potential factors that may contribute to animals stress level for awake imaging. Among many factors, we found that the restraining setup allowing forelimbs freely moving and head tilted at 30-degree was optimal for minimizing stress level. Importantly, we implemented multiband simultaneous multi-slice imaging to enable ultrafast fMRI acquisition in awake mice. Compared to conventional single-band EPI, faster acquisition enabled by multiband imaging were more robust to head motion and yielded higher statistical power. Thus, more robust resting-state functional connectivity was detected using multiband acquisition in awake mouse fMRI, compared to conventional single-band acquisition. In conclusion, we presented an awake mouse fMRI paradigm that is highly optimized in both awake mice habituation and fMRI acquisition, and such paradigm minimized animals stress level and provided more resistance to head motion and higher statistical power.",

    "abstract": "On a daily basis, humans interact with the outside world using judgments of sensorimotor confidence, constantly evaluating our actions for success. We ask, what sensory and motorexecution cues are used in making these judgements and when are they available? Two sources of temporally distinct information are prospective cues, available prior to the action (e.g., knowledge of motor noise and past performance), and retrospective cues specific to the action itself (e.g., proprioceptive measurements). We investigated the use of these two cues in two tasks, a secondary motor-awareness task and a main task in which participants reached toward a visual target with an unseen hand and then made a continuous judgment of confidence about the success of the reach. Confidence was reported by setting the size of a circle centered on the reach-target location, where a larger circle reflects lower confidence. Points were awarded if the confidence circle enclosed the true endpoint, with fewer points returned for larger circles. This incentivized accurate reaches and attentive reporting to maximize the score. We compared three Bayesian-inference models of sensorimotor confidence based on either prospective cues, retrospective cues, or both sources of information to maximize expected gain (i.e., an ideal-performance model). Our findings showed two distinct strategies: participants either performed as ideal observers, using both prospective and retrospective cues to make the confidence judgment, or relied solely on prospective information, ignoring retrospective cues. Thus, participants can make use of retrospective cues, evidenced by the behavior observed in our motorawareness task, but these cues are not always included in the computation of sensorimotor confidence.\n\nAuthor SummarySensorimotor confidence is a secondary judgment about how successful we feel a motor action was with relation to the goal. To make this judgment we can draw on information available before we execute an action such as our past experiences and knowledge of the environment, as well as after the action including visual feedback and proprioception, a sense of where our body is in space. In this study, we inquired as to how the information available before and after an action is weighted when considering the final feeling of sensorimotor confidence. To do so we asked participants to make reaches to visually cued targets in an unseen hand task, then report their confidence in how successful they were at hitting the target. We measured each participants reach accuracy and proprioceptive sensitivity in a separate task. Using mathematical models to fit our data we tested if a given participant depended more heavily on prior information or retrospective information when making their confidence judgment. We found that participants with high proprioceptive uncertainty were more likely to focus on prior knowledge while those with a more exact sense of proprioception incorporated information from both time points.",

However, the contribution of subcortical areas, such as the hippocampus and amygdala in the formation of predictions remains under-explored.

We presented epileptic patients undergoing presurgical monitoring with standard and deviant sounds, in a predictable or unpredictable context. Onsets of auditory responses and unpredictable deviance effects were detected at earlier latencies in the temporal cortex compared to the amygdala and hippocampus. Deviance effects in 1-20 Hz local field potentials were detected in the lateral temporal cortex, irrespective of predictability. The amygdala showed stronger deviance responses in the unpredictable context. Additionally, low frequency deviance responses in the hippocampus (1-8 Hz) were observed in the predictable but not in the unpredictable context. Our results reveal a distributed cortical-subcortical network underlying the generation of auditory predictions, comprising temporal cortex and the hippocampus and amygdala, and suggest that the neural basis of sensory predictions and prediction error signals needs to be extended to subcortical regions.",

Recently, we showed that females in the intrahippocampal kainic acid (IHKA) mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy were found to display changes in pituitary expression of gonadotropin hormone and GnRH receptor genes. Circulating gonadotropin hormone levels, however, have yet to be measured in an animal model of epilepsy. Here, we evaluated the circulating levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), GnRH receptor (Gnrhr) gene expression, and sensitivity to exogenous GnRH in IHKA males and females. Although no changes in overall dynamics of pulsatile patterns of LH release were found in IHKA mice of either sex, estrus vs. diestrus changes in basal and mean LH levels were larger in IHKA females with prolonged, disrupted estrous cycles. In addition, IHKA females displayed increased pituitary sensitivity to GnRH and higher Gnrhr expression. The hypersensitivity to GnRH was observed on diestrus, but not estrus. Chronic seizure severity was not found to be correlated with LH parameters, and FSH levels were unchanged in IHKA mice. These results indicate that although there are changes in pituitary gene expression and sensitivity to GnRH in IHKA females, there may also be compensatory mechanisms that aid in maintaining gonadotropin release in the state of chronic epilepsy in this model.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveOligodendrocyte progenitor cell differentiation is regulated by nutritional signals in the adult median eminence (ME), but the consequences on local myelination are unknown. The aim of this study was to characterise myelin plasticity in the ME of adult mice in health or in response to chronic nutritional challenge.\n\nMethodsWe assessed new oligodendrocyte and myelin generation and stability in the ME of healthy adult male mice using bromodeoxyuridine labelling and genetic fate mapping tools. We assessed the contribution of microglia to ME myelin plasticity in PLX5622-treated C57BL6/J mice and in Pdgfra-Cre/ERT2;R26R-eYFP;Myrffl/fl mice, where adult oligodendrogenesis is genetically blunted. Finally, we investigated how 45% high fat diet or 70% caloric restriction feeding paradigms impact ME oligodendrocyte lineage progression and myelination in C57BL6/J mice.\n\nResultsWe show that myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) are continuously and rapidly generated in the adult ME. Paradoxically, OL number and myelin amounts remain remarkably stable in the adult ME. In fact, the high rate of new OL and myelin generation in the ME is offset by continuous turnover of both. We show that microglia are required for continuous OL and myelin production, and that ME myelin plasticity regulates the recruitment of local immune cells. Finally, we provide evidence that ME myelination is regulated by the bodys energetic status, decreased in calorie-restricted animals, and increased in mice fed a high fat diet.\n\nConclusionsThis study uncovers a previously unappreciated form of ME structural plasticity and mechanism of myelin remodeling in the adult brain.",

    "abstract": "Although considerable progress has been made in finding a therapy for Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease, there still is no effective approved treatment. Previously, we reported results from a small molecule screen that was conducted on Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (CT60) that lacked NPC1 expression. The hit compounds that were effective in reducing cholesterol accumulation in CT60 cells were not effective on human cells bearing disease-causing mutations in NPC1. Hence, we conducted a new small molecule screen on patient-derived NPC1 skin fibroblasts using a combinatorial library of ~48,000 compounds. We have identified several compounds that corrected the phenotype in human heterozygous mutant NPC1 skin fibroblasts (GM03123) bearing the inactivating I1061T mutation in one allele and another set of inactivating mutations in the other. Among the hit compounds were several histone deacetylase inhibitors, which we have explored further and reported previously. With the determination of the structure of NPC1 protein and the development of computational docking algorithms, it seems worthwhile to show the structures of 128 compounds that reproducibly reduced cholesterol storage in mutant NPC1 fibroblasts but with no known mechanism of action. These compounds were not toxic and specifically effective on mutant cells but not on NPC1-/- cells, indicating on-target effect directly or indirectly.",

    "abstract": "EEG alpha power varies under many circumstances requiring visual attention. However, mounting evidence indicates that alpha may not only serve visual processing, but also the processing of stimuli presented in other sensory modalities, including hearing. We previously showed that alpha dynamics during an auditory task vary as a function of competition from the visual modality (Clements et al., 2022) suggesting that alpha may be engaged in multimodal processing. Here we assessed the impact of allocating attention to the visual or auditory modality on alpha dynamics, during the preparatory period of a bimodal-cued conflict task. In this task, precues indicated the modality (vision, hearing) relevant to a subsequent reaction stimulus. This task afforded us the opportunity to assess alpha during modality-specific preparation and while switching between modalities. Alpha suppression following the precue occurred in all conditions indicating that it may reflect general preparatory mechanisms. However, we observed a switch effect when preparing to attend to the auditory modality, in which greater alpha suppression was elicited when switching to the auditory modality compared to repeating. No switch effect was evident when preparing to attend to visual information (although robust suppression did occur in both conditions). In addition, waning alpha suppression preceded error trials, irrespective of sensory modality. These findings indicate that alpha can be used to monitor the level of preparatory attention to process both visual and auditory information. These results support the emerging view that alpha band activity may index a general attention control mechanism used across modalities, at least vision and hearing.",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) comprise a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases linked to TDP-43 proteinopathy, which at the cellular level, is characterized by loss of nuclear TDP-43 and accumulation of cytoplasmic TDP-43 puncta that ultimately cause RNA processing defects including dysregulation of splicing, mRNA transport and translation. Complementing our previous models of ALS, here we report a novel model of FTD based on overexpression of TDP-43 in the Drosophila mushroom body (MB) circuit. This model recapitulates several aspects of FTD pathology including age-dependent neuronal loss, and nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43, accompanied by behavioral deficits in working memory and sleep that occur before axonal degeneration ensues. RNA immunoprecipitations identify several candidate mRNA targets of TDP-43 in MBs, some of which are unique to the MB circuit while others are shared with motor neurons. Among the latter is the glypican Dally-like-protein (Dlp), a modulator of Wg/Wnt signaling. Using genetic interactions we show that overexpression of Dlp in MBs mitigates TDP-43 dependent working memory deficits. These results highlight the utility of modelling TDP-43 proteinopathy in Drosophila and provide a novel platform for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying FTD, and potentially uncovering shared and circuit specific vulnerabilities in ALS/FTD.",

    "abstract": "Segmenting the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) divisions of the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has been challenging yet remains an important goal because the LGN is the only place in the brain where these two information streams are spatially disjoint and can be studied independently. Previous research used the amplitude of responses to different types of stimuli to separate M and P regions (Denison et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015). However, this method is confounded because the hilum region of the LGN exhibits greater response amplitudes to all stimuli and can be mistaken for the M subdivision (DeSimone & Schneider, 2019). Therefore, we have employed two independent methodologies that do not rely upon the functional response properties of the M and P neurons to segment the M and P regions: 1) structural quantitative MRI (qMRI) at 3T to measure the T1 relaxation time, and 2) monocular and dichoptic functional MRI (fMRI) procedures to measure eye-specific responses. Our qMRI results agreed with the anatomical expectations, identifying M regions on the ventromedial surface of the LGN. The monocular fMRI procedure was better than the dichoptic condition to identify the eye-dominance signals. Both procedures revealed significant right eye bias, and neither could reliably identify the first M layer of the LGN. These findings indicated that the qMRI methods are promising whereas the functional identification of contralateral layers requires further refinement.\n\nHighlightsO_LIT1 parameter in qMRI segregates M and P regions of LGN in individual subjects at 3T.\nC_LIO_LIEye-specific voxels in LGN respond more strongly to monocular than dichoptic viewing.\nC_LIO_LIClusters of eye-specific regions but not layers can be separated at 1.5 mm resolution.\nC_LI",

It is unknown whether such errors have a sensory origin and reflect true perceptual illusions, or whether they have a more cognitive origin (e.g., are due to guessing), or both. When participants performed an error-prone and challenging face/house discrimination task, multivariate EEG analyses revealed that during decision errors (mistaking a face for a house), sensory stages of visual information processing initially represent the presented stimulus category. Crucially however, when participants were confident in their erroneous decision, so when the illusion was strongest, this neural representation flipped later in time and reflected the incorrectly reported percept. This flip in neural pattern was absent for decisions that were made with low confidence. This work demonstrates that decision confidence arbitrates between perceptual decision errors, which reflect true illusions of perception, and cognitive decision errors, which do not.",

    "abstract": "Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that poses threats to hospitalized immunocompromised patients 1. A non-coding small RNA (sRNA) from the repressor of secondary metabolites (Rsm) system, RsmZ, sequesters the global repressor protein RsmA to regulate downstream gene expressions that reprogram virulence repertoires associated with acute and chronic P. aeruginosa infections 2,3. Molecular insights into the full-length RsmZ architecture remain elusive, leading to the lack of understanding of RsmZ binding to RsmA and subsequent modulations of gene expressions. Here we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to resolve structures of the full-length RsmZ in complexes with RsmA, in which five stem-loops (SLs) and one single-stranded junction carrying the GGA binding sites in RsmZ form three pairs of clamps, each binding to a RsmA homodimer. Disruptions of the base-pairings in all stems of RsmZ significantly reduced the binding affinity to RsmA by 17-fold, which resulted in enhanced RsmA downregulation of gene expressions and phenotypes associated to both acute and chronic virulence of P. aeruginosa. Double mutations that rescued these stems of RsmZ restored the binding to RsmA by more than 5-fold, and recovered the corresponding phenotypes. Our results reveal the molecular mechanism of RsmZ regulation of P. aeruginosa virulence and suggest RsmZ as a potential target for the development of new antimicrobial agents.",

    "abstract": "Liver X receptor (LXR) signaling broadly restricts virus replication; however, the mechanisms of restriction are poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that the LXR-inducible cellular E3 ligase IDOL (inducible degrader of low-density lipoprotein receptor, LDLR) targets the human cytomegalovirus (HMCV) UL136p33 protein for turnover. UL136 encodes multiple proteins that differentially impact latency and reactivation. UL136p33 is a determinant of reactivation. UL136p33 is targeted for rapid turnover by the proteasome and its stabilization by mutation of lysine residues to arginine results in a failure to quiet replication for latency. We show that IDOL targets UL136p33 for turnover, but not the stabilized variant. IDOL is highly expressed in undifferentiated hematopoietic cells where HCMV establishes latency, but is sharply downregulated upon differentiation, a stimulus for reactivation. We hypothesize that IDOL maintains low levels of UL136p33 for the establishment of latency. Consistent with this, knockdown of IDOL impacts viral gene expression in WT HCMV infection, but not in infection where UL136p33 has been stabilized. Further, induction of LXR signaling restricts WT HCMV reactivation from latency, but does not affect replication of a recombinant virus expressing a stabilized variant of UL136p33. This work establishes the UL136p33-IDOL interaction as a key regulator of the bistable switch between latency and reactivation. It further suggests a model whereby a key viral determinant of HCMV reactivation is regulated by a host E3 ligase and acts as a sensor at the tipping point between the decision to maintain the latent state or exit latency for reactivation.\n\nImportanceHerpesviruses establish life-long latent infections, which pose an important risk for disease particularly in the immunocompromised. Our work is focused on the beta-herpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) that latently infects the majority of the population worldwide. Defining the mechanisms by which HCMV establishes latency or reactivates from latency is important to controlling viral disease. Here, we demonstrate that the cellular inducible degrader of low-density lipoprotein receptor, IDOL, targets a HCMV determinant of reactivation for degradation. The instability of this determinant is important for the establishment of latency. This work defines a pivotal virus-host interaction that allows HCMV to sense changes in host biology to navigate decisions to establish latency or replicate.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcal infections frequently show high levels of antibiotic resistance, including to cell envelope-acting antibiotics like daptomycin (DAP). While we have a good understanding of the resistance mechanisms, less is known about the control of such resistance genes in enterococci. Previous work unveiled a bacitracin resistance network, comprised of the sensory ABC transporter SapAB, the two-component system (TCS) SapRS and the resistance ABC transporter RapAB. Interestingly, components of this system have recently been implicated in DAP resistance, a role usually regulated by the TCS LiaFSR. We here explored the interplay between these two regulatory pathways. Our results show the regulation by SapR of an additional resistance operon, dltXABCD, and show that LiaFSR regulates the expression of sapRS, placing SapRS target genes under dual control: dltXABCD expression depends on both antibiotic-induced cellular damage (LiaFSR) and the presence of a substrate drug for the sensory transporter (SapAB). We further show that this network protects E. faecalis from antimicrobials produced by potential competitor bacteria, providing a potential rationale for the evolution of this regulatory strategy. The network structure described here can explain why clinical DAP resistance often emerges via mutations in regulatory components, which may ultimately lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516778v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ed4b2corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e24a2eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17438edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1458bd9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

It is rich in nutrients, drought-tolerant, and a climate change contender for future agriculture. The objectives of this study were to isolate and identify culturable bacterial endophytes. Our study assessed the mean CFUs/mL among the tuberous roots, stems, and leaves to determine the density and diversity using ANOVA. It was a quantitatively controlled experiment in which seeds were grown in a greenhouse. The bacteria number varied from 1.29 x 108 to 3.5 x 108 CFU/ml of broth, with the highest in the tuberous roots and the lowest in the leaves. At a 5% significant level, we revealed that there is a difference among the bacterial densities of the plant parts. Shannon-Weiner diversity showed that there is a higher diversity of bacteria in the tuberous roots. Of the isolates that were obtained, 53.8% belonged to Enterobacter, 15.4% to Bacillus, 15.4% to Pantoea, and 7.67% to Burkholderia. These discoveries have made us more aware of the endophytic bacteria we now have. These strains might thus be used in food crops to boost productivity, enabling food security, especially in Africa.

    "abstract": "1Infectious Spleen and Kidney Necrosis Virus (ISKNV) is increasingly gaining more attention globally, due to its highly significant economic impact on the aquaculture industry. In late 2018, unusually high levels of mortality (60-90%) was reported in some intensive tilapia cage culture systems in Ghana. Preliminary investigations confirmed the involvement of ISKNV, a viral pathogen noted for fatal systemic infections in many fish species. As a follow-up on the outbreak situation, and post-mass vaccination of affected fish farms, the need to investigate further the molecular epidemiology and phylogeography of the virus across Lake Volta became paramount. In this study, a multiplexed PCR assay and MinION nanopore sequencing of the Major Capsid Protein (MCP) were performed to investigate the presence and genotype of ISKNV in tilapia collected from 30 randomly selected farms spread across Lake Volta. Fish with and without clinical signs were included in the molecular detection of the virus from brain, kidney and spleen tissues. ISKNV was detected at 80% prevalence with fry and juvenile fish being most affected. Phylogenetic analysis of the MCP revealed that all 35 isolates from 14 different farms were ISKNV genotype I with near- 100% homology to the 2018 outbreak strain. Vaccination and heat shock treatment; the main specific interventions currently employed to control the viral pathogen have not achieved much success and ISKNV remains a threat to the growth of the aquaculture industry in Ghana. The outcome of this study can be useful in improving fish health management and biosecurity policies in the aquaculture industry.",

    "abstract": "BBX genes are associated with photomorphogenesis, hormone response and seed gemination. Although, BBX gene family is reported in G. max, little is known about its classification and expansion. Similarly, no information is available for the BBX gene family in its closest relative Glycine soja (Siebold & Zucc.). With extensive genome diversity, G. soja can be used as an effective genetic reservoir for introgressing important agronomic traits in G. max. In the present study, we carried out a comprehensive comparative genome-wide analysis of BBX gene family in G. max and G. soja, to identify their evolutionary relationship and origin in plant lineage. Our results show an ancient BBX gene family expansion through segmental duplication, further suggesting, that the GmBBX members are the out-paralogs. These genes show lineage-specific evolution and expansion in the ancestral Glycine genome supported by the incidences of microsynteny between G. max and G. soja. The two genomes also showed interesting evidence of conserved linkages which might be due to their common ancestor descendance, with minimum horizontal expansion in G. max after its split from G. soja. Our study suggests that the BBX gene family diverged before the split of G. max and G. soja. As the two genomes share several regions of synteny, the paralogous members in G. max could have been a result of segmental duplications.",

    "abstract": "High prevalence of parasitic or bacterial infectious diseases in some world areas is due to multiple reasons, including a lack of an appropriate health policy, challenging logistics and poverty. The support to research and development of new medicines to fight infectious diseases is one of the sustainable development goals promoted by World Health Organization (WHO). In this sense, the traditional medicinal knowledge substantiated by ethnopharmacology is a valuable starting point for drug discovery. This work aims at the scientific validation of the traditional use of Piper species (\"Cordoncillos\") as firsthand anti-infectious medicines. For this purpose, we adapted a computational statistical model to correlate the LCMS chemical profiles of 54 extracts from 19 Piper species to their corresponding anti-infectious assay results based on 37 microbial or parasites strains. We mainly identified two groups of bioactive compounds (called features as they are considered at the analytical level and are not formally isolated). Group 1 is composed of 11 features being highly correlated to an inhibiting activity on 21 bacteria (principally Gram-positive strains), one fungus (C. albicans), and one parasite (Trypanosoma brucei gambiense). The group 2 is composed of 9 features having a clear selectivity on Leishmania (all strains, both axenic and intramacrophagic). Bioactive features in group 1 were identified principally in the extracts of Piper strigosum and P. xanthostachyum. In group 2, bioactive features were distributed in the extracts of 14 Piper species. This multiplexed approach provided a broad picture of the metabolome as well as a map of compounds putatively associated to bioactivity. To our knowledge, the implementation of this type of metabolomics tools aimed at identifying bioactive compounds has not been used so far.",

    "abstract": "Significant recent advances in structural biology, particularly in the field of cryo-electron microscopy, have dramatically expanded our ability to create structural models of proteins and protein complexes. However, many proteins remain refractory to these approaches because of their low abundance, low stability or - in the case of complexes - simply not having yet been analysed. Here, we demonstrate the power of combining cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) with artificial intelligence-based structure prediction to discover and experimentally substantiate models for protein and protein complex structures at proteome scale. We present the deepest XL-MS dataset to date, describing 28,910 unique residue pairs captured across 4,084 unique human proteins and 2,110 unique protein-protein interactions. We show that integrative models of complexes driven by AlphaFold Multimer and inspired and corroborated by the XL-MS data offer new opportunities to deeply mine the structural proteome and interactome and reveal new mechanisms underlying protein structure and function.",

    "abstract": "Engineered bone tissue synthesized from mesenchymal stem cell progenitors has numerous applications throughout the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. However, these multipotent cells offer little tissue-building assistance without differentiation direction from environmental cues such as bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Unfortunately, BMP dosing and environmental cues can be difficult to control both in vitro and after in vivo delivery. Several BMP antagonists are expressed by cells in response to BMP dosing that bind extracellular BMPs and reduce their effective concentration. Here, we use CRISPR-guided gene-modulation technology to downregulate the expression of three BMP antagonists, noggin, gremlin-1, and gremlin-2, in adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs). We show that regulating noggin using this method results in ASC osteogenesis without the need for exogenous growth factors. To demonstrate the versatility and the precision capabilities of these engineered cells, we employ them with CRISPRa multiplex-engineered chondrogenic cells as a proof-of-concept tissue engineering application by creating a tissue gradient similar to the fibrocartilage-to-mineralized-fibrocartilage gradient in the tendon/ligament enthesis or intervertebral disc attachment. In doing so, we show that multiple CRISPR multiplex engineered cell types can be utilized in concert to provide a high degree of tissue developmental control without the use of exogenous growth factors.",

    "abstract": "Many bioactive peptides demonstrated therapeutic effects over-complicated diseases, such as antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, etc. Similar to the generating de novo chemical compounds, with the accumulated bioactive peptides as a training set, it is possible to generate abundant potential bioactive peptides with deep learning. Such techniques would be significant for drug development since peptides are much easier and cheaper to synthesize than compounds. However, there are very few deep learning-based peptide generating models. Here, we have created an LSTM model (named LSTM_Pep) to generate de novo peptides and finetune learning to generate de novo peptides with certain potential therapeutic effects. Remarkably, the Antimicrobial Peptide Database has fully utilized in this work to generate various kinds of potential active de novo peptide. We proposed a pipeline for screening those generated peptides for a given target, and use Main protease of SARS-COV-2 as concept-of-proof example. Moreover, we have developed a deep learning-based protein-peptide prediction model (named DeepPep) for fast screening the generated peptides for the given targets. Together with the generating model, we have demonstrated iteratively finetune training, generating and screening peptides for higher predicted binding affinity peptides can be achieved. Our work sheds light on to the development of deep learning-based methods and pipelines to effectively generating and getting bioactive peptides with a specific therapeutic effect, and showcases how artificial intelligence can help discover de novo bioactive peptides that can bind to a particular target.",

However, inconsistencies among deposited structures, such as different chain or sequence numbering, hamper a straightforward comparison of all structures. The tool described in this note fixes those inconsistencies and calculates the distribution of the requested distance between any two atoms across all SARS-CoV-2 spike structures available in the Protein Data Bank, with the option to filter by various selections.

    "abstract": "CXCL10 is an interferon-inducible chemokine that can recruit CXCR3+ leukocytes to the central nervous system, leading to neuroinflammation, demyelination, and neuronal losses. How CXCL10 promotes leukocyte extravasation and diapedesis across the blood-brain barrier - formed by brain endothelial cells - is poorly understood. Here, we report that CXCL10 mediates CD4+ T cell migration through the brain endothelial cell cytoplasm (transcellular), but not cell-cell junctions (paracellular), via the vesicular trafficking protein Caveolin-1. Caveolin-1 promotes CXCL10 aggregation into cytoplasmic stores in brain endothelial cells in vitro to provide the local, high concentration necessary for recruitment of CXCR3+ leukocytes. This process also requires LFA-1 activity. In the absence of Caveolin-1, endothelial CXCL10 is secreted, and the local signaling cues are lost. Consistent with our in vitro data, genetic ablation of Caveolin-1 in endothelial cells reduces the severity of active experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a murine model for multiple sclerosis, by decreasing the infiltration of CXCR3+ T cells into the CNS. Moreover, loss of Caveolin-1 protects against the adoptive transfer of autoreactive T cells. Our findings establish a novel mechanism by which brain endothelial cells utilize Caveolin-1 dependent CXCL10 intracellular stores to license T cells for transcellular migration across the blood-brain barrier.",

    "abstract": "Recent human H3N2 influenza A viruses (IAV) have evolved to employ elongated glycans terminating in 2,6-linked sialic acid as their receptors. These glycans are displayed in low abundancies by cells commonly employed to propagate these viruses (MDCK and hCK), resulting in low or no viral propagation. Here, we examined whether the overexpression of the glycosyltransferases B3GNT2 and B4GALT1, which are responsible for the elongation of poly-N-acetyllactosamines (LacNAc), would result in improved A/H3N2 propagation. Stable overexpression of B3GNT2 and B4GALT1 in MDCK and hCK cells was achieved by lentiviral integration and subsequent antibiotic selection and confirmed by qPCR and protein mass spectrometry experiments. Flow cytometry and glycan mass spectrometry experiments using the B3GNT2 and/or B4GALT1 knock-in cells demonstrated increased binding of viral hemagglutinins and the presence of a larger number of LacNAc repeating units, especially on hCK-B3GNT2 cells. An increase in the number of glycan receptors did, however, not result in a greater infection efficiency of recent human H3N2 viruses. Based on these results, we propose that H3N2 IAVs require a low number of suitable glycan receptors to infect cells and that an increase in the glycan receptor display above this threshold does not result in improved infection efficiency.",

    "abstract": "The cell wall is a unifying trait in bacteria and provides protection against environmental insults. Therefore, the wall is considered essential for most bacteria. Despite this critical role, many bacteria can transiently shed their cell wall and recent observations suggest a link of such wall-deficient cells to chronic infections. Whether shedding the cell wall also occurs in mycobacteria has not been established unambiguously. Here we provide compelling evidence that a wide range of mycobacterial species, including clinical and non-clinical isolates, form viable cell wall-deficient cells in response to environmental stressors. Using cryo-transmission electron micrography we show that the complex multi-layered wall is largely lost in such cells. Notably, we show that their formation in Mycobacterium marinum and BCG vaccine strains of Mycobacterium bovis is stimulated by exposure to cell wall-targeting antibiotics. Given that these wall-deficient mycobacteria are undetectable using conventional diagnostic methods, such cells have likely been overlooked in clinical settings. Altogether, these results indicate that mycobacteria can readily switch between a walled and wall-deficient lifestyle, which provides a plausible explanation for enabling persistence of infections caused by members of this genus.",

Here we use deep amplicon sequencing of a single copy gene in the T. cruzi genome to evaluate the diversity of infection in a collection of clinical blood samples from Chagas positive mothers and their infected infants. We found several infants and mothers infected with more than two parasite haplotypes, indicating infection with multiple parasite strains. Two haplotypes were detected exclusively in infant samples, while one haplotype was never found in infants, suggesting a relationship between the probability of transmission and parasite genotype. Finally, we found an increase in parasite population diversity in children after birth compared to their mothers, suggesting that there is no transmission bottleneck during congenital infection and that multiple parasites breach the placenta in the course of congenital transmission.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a prominent chloride channel that governs mucous secretion in multiple organs, including the reproductive tract. According to earlier reports, defective CFTR results in infertility due to congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD). However, obstruction in the vas deferens is not the only reason CFTR deficiency causes male infertility. The mechanism underlying the loss of mature sperm owing to CFTR deficiency remains elusive. This study aimed to assess the role of CFTR in spermatogenesis, for which 6- and 8-week-old male mice with Cftr+/+, Cftr+/-, and Cftr-/- genotypes were chosen. Furthermore, we assessed the correlation between CFTR deficiency and delayed development of the reproductive system, anomalous apoptosis activation in spermatogenesis, and ionic alterations of the testis lumen. The results demonstrated that the growth of Cftr-/- mice were delayed, with underweight reproductive organs and mild hypospermatogenesis. CFTR depletion destabilizes spermatogenesis by producing abnormal sperm and triggers activation of the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in Cftr-/- and Cftr+/-mice, causing caspase-mediated irreversible intrinsic apoptosis. Stage-specific apoptosis in germ cells targeted the sexually mature mice, and the testis microenvironment affirmed that ion concentrations influence sperm capacitation. The blood pH determines apoptosis induction, as CFTR is a bicarbonate transporter. In conclusion, Cftr-/- mice were infertile because CFTR deficiency generated an ionic imbalance in the testis lumen, leading to Bax expression and Bcl-2 blockage, which triggered caspases or further activation of voltage-dependent anion-selective channel 1 (VDAC1). Cumulatively, cytochrome C was released due to altered mitochondrial membrane potential. Eventually, anomalous up-regulated apoptosis activation affected spermatogenesis, thus rendering the Cftr-/- male mice infertile. The results supplied new insights into CFTR modulation in reproduction: an imbalanced testicular microenvironment due to CFTR deficiency affects spermatogenesis and fertility in mice through the overactivation of spermatocyte caspase signalling, thus driving us to focus on updated treatments for CFTR deficiency-caused infertility.",

These oligonucleotides can be adenylated enzymatically or chemically. Enzymatic adenylation reactions have high yield but are not amendable to scale up. In chemical adenylation, Adenosine 5{square}-phosphorimidazolide (ImpA) reacts with 5' phosphorylated DNA. It is easily scalable but gives poor yields, requiring labor-intensive cleanup steps. Here, we describe an improved chemical adenylation method using 95% formamide as the solvent, which results in the adenylation of oligonucleotides with >90% yield. In standard conditions, with water as the solvent, hydrolysis of the starting material to adenosine monophosphate limits the yields. To our surprise, we find that rather than increasing adenylation yields by decreasing the rate of ImpA hydrolysis, formamide does so by increasing the reaction rate between ImpA and 5'-phosphorylated DNA by [~]10 fold. The method described here enables straightforward preparation of chemically adenylated adapters with higher than 90% yield, simplifying reagent preparation for NGS.",

    "abstract": "Pioneer transcription factors direct cell differentiation by deploying new enhancer repertoires through their unique ability to target and initiate remodelling of closed chromatin. The initial steps of their action remain undefined although pioneers were shown to interact with nucleosomal target DNA and with some chromatin remodelling complexes. We now define the sequence of events that enable the pioneer Pax7 with its unique abilities. Chromatin condensation exerted by linker histone H1 is the first constraint on Pax7 recruitment, and this establishes the initial speed of chromatin remodelling. The first step of pioneer action involves recruitment of the KDM1A (LSD1) H3K9me2 demethylase for removal of this repressive mark, as well as recruitment of the MLL complex for deposition of the activating H3K4me1 mark. Further progression of pioneer action requires passage through cell division, and this involves dissociation of pioneer targets from perinuclear lamin B. Only then, the SWI/SNF remodeling complex and the coactivator p300 are recruited, leading to nucleosome displacement and enhancer activation. Thus, the unique features of pioneer actions are those occurring in the lamin-associated compartment of the nucleus. This model is consistent with prior work that showed a dependence on cell division for establishment of new cell fates.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9, an efficient genome editing tool, has been widely used in research and holds great promise in the clinic. However, large unintended rearrangements of the genome occur frequently after CRISPR-Cas9 editing and their potential risk cannot be ignored. In this study, we detected large deletions (LDs) induced by CRISPR-Cas9 in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and found the microhomology end joining (MMEJ) DNA repair pathway plays a predominant role in LD. We genetically targeted PARP1, RPA, POLQ and LIG3, which play critical roles in MMEJ, during CRISPR-Cas9 editing. By analyzing LD events in two independent gene loci, CD9 and PIGA, using flow cytometry and long-read individual molecule sequencing (IDMseq), we showed that knocking down PARP1 and LIG3 does not alter the frequency of Cas9-induced LD, while knocking down or inhibiting POLQ dramatically reduces LD. Knocking down RPA increases LD frequency, and overexpression of RPAs consistently reduces LD frequency. Interestingly, small-molecule inhibition of POLQ and delivery of recombinant RPA proteins also dramatically increase the efficiency of homology-directed repair (HDR). In conclusion, RPA and POLQ play opposite roles in Cas9-induced LD, modulation of POLQ and RPA can reduce LD and improve HDR, thus holding promise for safe and precise genome editing.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) load onto Argonaute (AGO) proteins and target messenger RNAs (mRNA) to directly suppress gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. However, miRNA degradation can be triggered when there is extended base-pairing between miRNAs and the target RNAs. Such base-pairing can induce confirmational change of AGO and recruitment of ZSWIM8 ubiquitin ligase to mark AGO for proteasomal degradation, while the miRNAs are subsequently degraded. This target RNA-directed miRNA degradation (TDMD) mechanism appears to be an evolutionary conserved mechanism, but recent studies have focused on identifying endogenous TDMD events in the mammalian systems. Here, we performed AGO1-CLASH (crosslinking and sequencing of miRNA-mRNA hybrids) in Drosophila S2 cells, with Dora (ortholog of vertebrate ZSWIM8) knockout (KO) mediated by CRISPR-Cas9 to identify five TDMD triggers (sequences that can induce miRNA degradation). Interestingly, one trigger residing in the 3' UTR of AGO1 mRNA induces miR-999 degradation. CRISPR-Cas9 KO of the AGO1 trigger in S2 cells and in Drosophila elevates miR-999 abundance, with concurrent repression of the miR-999 targets. AGO1 trigger-KO flies respond poorly to hydrogen peroxide-induced stress, demonstrating the physiological importance of a single TDMD event.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveNon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), characterized by hepatic steatosis, is one of the most common causes of liver dysfunction. ATGL is closely related to hepatic steatosis as the speed-limited triacylglycerol lipase. Nevertheless, the expression and regulation of ATGL in NAFLD remain unclear.\n\nMethodsUsing immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR to detect the expression of ATGL and BTRC in different models with hepatic steatosis. Co-IP evaluated the binding of ATGL and BTRC. Knockdown of BTRC employed by adenoviruses and then analyzed the ATGL expression, triglyceride levels, and lipid droplets accumulation.\n\nResultsOur results revealed that ATGL protein level was decreased in animal and cellular models of hepatic steatosis and the liver tissues of cholangioma/hepatic carcinoma patients with hepatic steatosis, while the ATGL mRNA level had hardly changed; which means the decreased ATGL mainly degraded through the proteasome pathway. BTRC was identified as the E3 ligase for ATGL, up-regulated, and negatively correlated with ATGL level. Moreover, adenovirus-mediated knockdown of BTRC ameliorated hepatic steatosis via up-regulating ATGL level.\n\nConclusionsOur study demonstrates a crucial role of elevated BTRC in hepatic steatosis through promoting ATGL proteasomal degradation as a new ATGL E3 ligase and suggests BTRC may serve as a potential therapeutic target for NAFLD.\n\nFundingThis study was supported by The National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 82070888, 82070882, 82100917, 81872165, 82273116, 82203661, 81901557 and 81902693); Key Project of Nature Science Foundation of Guangdong Province, China (Grant 2019B1515120077); National Key R&D Program of China (Grant 2018YFA0800403); Guangdong Special Support Program for Young Top Scientist (Grant 201629046); Guangdong Natural Science Fund (Grant 2019A1515011810, 2021A1515010434, 2022A1515012423 and 2022A1515012513); Key Sci-Tech Research Project of Guangzhou Municipality (Grants 202201010820) Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant 50000-31620106); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant 2021M703679, 2020M683110).",

    "abstract": "SLC3A2 (4F2hc, CD98) is an adaptor to the SLC7A exchangers and has undergone extensive repositioning of N-glycosylation sites with vertebrate evolution, presumably in synchrony with the species-specific demands of metabolism. The SLC3A2*SLC7A5 heterodimer imports essential amino acids (AA) and thereby stimulates mTOR signaling, while SLC3A2*SLC7A11 imports cystine required for glutathione synthesis and mitigation of oxidative stress. Analysis of SLC3A2 N-glycans revealed stable site-specific profiles of Golgi remodeling, apart from the conserved N365 site where branching and poly-N-acetylglucosamine content were sensitive to the insertion of lost ancestral sites and to metabolism. N-glycans at N381 and N365 stabilized SLC3A2 in the galectin lattice and opposed endocytosis, while N365 which is nearest the membrane, also promoted down-regulation by galectin-driven clathrin-independent endocytosis (glycolipid-lectin GL-Lect). This is the first report of both positive and negative regulation by galectin binding to N-glycans that are strategically positioned in the same membrane glycoproteins. Proteomics analysis in SLC3A2 mutant HeLa cells with induced re-expression of SLC3A2 as bait revealed the canonical non-N-glycosylated interactors, SLC7A5 and SLC7A11 exchangers, but also AA transporters that were dependent on SLC3A2 N-glycosylation, and are themselves, N-glycosylated AA/Na+ symporters (SLC7A1, SLC38A1, SLC38A2, SLC1A4, SLC1A5). The results suggest that the N-glycans on SLC3A2 regulate clustering of SLC7A exchangers with AA/Na+ symporters, thereby promoting Gln/Glu export-driven import of essential AA and cystine, with the potential to adversely impact redox balance. The evolution of modern birds (Neoaves) led to improved control of bioenergetics with the loss of genes including SLC3A2, SLC7A-5, -7, -8, -10, BCAT2, KEAP1, as well as duplications of SLC7A9, SLC7A11 and the Golgi branching enzymes MGAT4B and MGAT4C known to enhance affinities for galectins. Analyzing the fate of these and other genes in the down-sized genomes of birds, spanning [~]10,000 species and >100 Myr of evolution, may reveal the mystery of their longevity with prolonged vitality.\n\nKey PointsO_LIGolgi N-glycan remodeling at each site on SLC3A2 differs with the microenvironment.\nC_LIO_LIThe galectin lattice and GL-Lect mediated endocytosis act as opposing forces on trafficking, controlled by N-glycans at the distal N381 and membrane proximal N365 sites, respectively.\nC_LIO_LIMutation at N381 or N365 decreased SLC3A2 association with SLC7A5, SLC7A11 and N-glycosylated AA/Na+ symporters as well as the capacity to mitigate stress.\nC_LIO_LIClustering of SLC3A2*SLC7A exchangers, with AA/Na+ symporter and ATPase Na+/K+ exchanger promotes growth but continuously consumes ATP in non-proliferating cells.\nC_LIO_LIBird evolution has improved bioenergetics with the deletion of SLC3A2 and associated transporters; - replaced by transporters of keto acids and a re-enforced galectin lattice.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=73 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516651v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cb7958org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18ba32dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@861269org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22df0e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The contribution of genetic backgrounds, in additional to ASD risk genes, on cortical neurogenesis remain understudied. Here, using isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and cortical organoid models, we report that a heterozygous PTEN p.I135L mutation found in an ASD patient with macrocephaly activates PI3K/AKT and dysregulates cortical neurogenesis in an ASD genetic background-dependent fashion. Transcriptome analysis at both bulk and single cell level revealed PTEN p.I135L mutation and ASD genetic background affected genes involved in neurogenesis, neural development and synapse signaling. We also found that this PTEN p.I135L mutation led to overproduction of NPC subtypes as well as neuronal subtypes including both deep and upper layer neurons in its ASD background, but not when introduced into a control genetic background. These findings provide experimental evidence that both a PTEN p.I135L mutation and ASD genetic background contribute to cellular features consistent with ASD associated with macrocephaly.",

    "abstract": "Mutant RHO is the most frequent genetic cause of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Here, we developed an allele-specific gene editing therapeutic drug to selectively target the human T17M RHO mutant allele while leaving the wild-type RHO allele intact for the first time. We identified a Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SaCas9) guide RNA that was highly active and specific to the human T17M RHO allele. In vitro experiments using HEK293T cells and patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) demonstrated active nuclease activity and high specificity. Subretinal delivery of a single adeno-associated virus serotype 2/8 packaging SaCas9 and sgRNA to the retinas of the RHO humanized mice showed that this therapeutic drug targeted the mutant allele selectively, thereby downregulating the mutant RHO mRNA expression. Administration of this therapeutic drug resulted in a long-term (up to 11 months after treatment) improvement of retinal function and preservation of photoreceptors in the mutant humanized heterozygous mice. Our study demonstrated a dose-dependent therapeutic effect in vivo. Unwanted off-target effects were not observed at the whole-genome sequencing level. Our study provides strong support for the further development of this effective therapeutic drug to treat RHO-T17M associated autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP), also offers a generalizable framework for developing gene editing medicine. Furthermore, our success in retoring the vision loss in the suffering RHO humanized mice verifies the feasibility of allele-specific CRISPR/Cas9-based medicines for other autosomal dominant inherited retinal dystrophies.",

    "abstract": "The accidental endogenization of viral elements within eukaryotic genomes can occasionally provide significant evolutionary benefits, giving rise to their long-term retention, that is, to viral domestication. For instance, in some endoparasitoid wasps (whose immature stages develop inside their hosts), the membrane-fusion property of double-stranded DNA viruses has been repeatedly domesticated following ancestral endogenizations. The endogenized genes provide female wasps with a delivery tool to inject virulence factors that are essential to the developmental success of their offspring. Because all known cases of viral domestication involve endoparasitic wasps, we hypothesized that this lifestyle, relying on a close interaction between individuals, may have promoted the endogenization and domestication of viruses. By analyzing the composition of 124 Hymenoptera genomes, spread over the diversity of this clade and including free-living, ecto- and endoparasitoid species, we tested this hypothesis. Our analysis first revealed that double-stranded DNA viruses, in comparisons with other viral genomic structures (ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA), are more often endogenized and domesticated (that is, retained by selection) than expected from their estimated abundance in insect viral communities. Secondly, our analysis indicates that the rate at which dsDNA viruses are endogenized is higher in endoparasitoids than in ectoparasitoids or free-living hymenopterans, which also translates into more frequent events of domestication. Hence, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the endoparasitoid lifestyle has facilitated the endogenization of dsDNA viruses, in turn increasing the opportunities of domestications that now play a central role in the biology of many endoparasitoid lineages.",

    "abstract": "To characterise the somatic alterations in colorectal cancer (CRC), we conducted whole-genome sequencing analysis of 2,023 tumours. We provide the most detailed high-resolution map to date of somatic mutations in CRC, and demonstrate associations with clinicopathological features, in particular location in the large bowel. We refined the mutational processes and signatures acting in colorectal tumorigenesis. In analyses across the sample set or restricted to molecular subtypes, we identified 185 CRC driver genes, of which 117 were previously unreported. New drivers acted in various molecular pathways, including Wnt (CTNND1, AXIN1, TCF3), TGF-{beta}/BMP (TGFBR1) and MAP kinase (RASGRF1, RASA1, RAF1, and several MAP2K and MAP3K loci). Non-coding drivers included intronic neo-splice site alterations in APC and SMAD4. Whilst there was evidence of an excess of mutations in functionally active regions of the non-coding genome, no specific drivers were called with high confidence. Novel recurrent copy number changes included deletions of PIK3R1 and PWRN1, as well as amplification of CCND3 and NEDD9. Putative driver structural variants included BRD4 and SOX9 regulatory elements, and ACVR2A and ANKRD11 hotspot deletions. The frequencies of many driver mutations, including somatic Wnt and Ras pathway variants, showed a gradient along the colorectum. The Pks-pathogenic E. coli signature and TP53 mutations were primarily associated with rectal cancer. A set of unreported immune escape driver genes was found, primarily in hypermutated CRCs, most of which showed evidence of genetic evasion of the anti-cancer immune response. About 25% of cancers had a potentially actionable mutation for a known therapy. Thirty-three of the new driver genes were predicted to be essential, 17 possessed a druggable structure, and nine had a bioactive compound available. Our findings provide further insight into the genetics and biology of CRC, especially tumour subtypes defined by genomic instability or clinicopathological features.",

Consequently, the systematic regulation of spatiotemporal gene transcription in the SCN is vital for daily timekeeping. Here, we sought to identify SCN enriched gene regulatory elements that enable temporal gene expression using histone-ChIP-seq. We found a vast majority of SCN enhancers not only exhibit robust 24-hour rhythmic modulation in H3K27ac occupancy, but also possess canonical E-box (CACGTG) motif, potentially influencing downstream cycling gene expression. In parallel, we conducted RNA-Seq at six distinct times to establish enhancer-gene relationships in the SCN. Surprisingly, around 35% of cycling H3K27ac abundance is seen adjacent to rhythmic gene transcripts, often preceding the rise in mRNA levels. We also noted that enhancers encompass non-coding actively transcribing enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), that in turn oscillate along with cyclic histone acetylation to direct gene transcription. Taken together, these findings shed light on genome-wide pre-transcriptional regulation operative in the central clock that enables its orchestration of daily timekeeping mechanisms in mammals.",

    "abstract": "The signaling molecule auxin is pivotal in coordinating many growth and development processes in plants mainly through the modulation of gene expression. The transcriptional response to auxin is mediated by the family of auxin response factors (ARF). Monomers of this family recognize a DNA motif (TGTC[TC]/[GG]) called the auxin-response element (AuxRE). ARFs can homodimerize through their DNA binding domains (DBD) thereby enabling cooperative binding for a bipartite inverted AuxRE (IR7). In addition to the DBD, most ARFs contain a C-terminal Phox and Bem1p (PB1) domain both capable of homotypic interactions, and mediating interactions with Aux/IAA repressors. Given the dual role of the PB1 domain, and the ability of both DBD and PB1 domain to mediate dimerization, a key question is how each of these domains contributes to conferring DNA-binding specificity and affinity. So far, ARF-ARF and ARF-DNA interactions have mostly been approached using qualitative methods that do not provide a quantitative and dynamic view on the binding equilibria. Here, we utilize a DNA binding assay based on single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) to study the affinity and kinetics of the interaction of several Arabidopsis thaliana ARFs with an IR7 AuxRE. We show that both DBD and PB1 domains of AtARF2 contribute toward DNA binding, and we identify ARF dimer stability as a key parameter in defining affinity and kinetics seen for the DBDs of different AtARFs. Lastly, we derived an analytical solution for a four-state cyclic model that explains both the kinetics and the affinity of the interaction between AtARF2 and IR7. Our work demonstrates that the affinity of ARFs towards composite DNA response elements can be tuned by small changes of their dimerization equilibrium suggesting that this effect has major implications for ARF-mediated transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial fimbrial adhesin FimH is a remarkable and well-studied catch-bond protein found at the tip of E. coli type 1 pili, which allows pathogenic strains involved in urinary tract infections to bind high-mannose glycans exposed on human epithelia. The catch-bond behavior of FimH, where the strength of the interaction increases when a force is applied to separate the two partners, enables the bacteria to resist clearance when they are subjected to shear forces induced by urine flow. Two decades of experimental studies performed at the single-molecule level, as well as X-ray crystallography and modeling studies, have led to a consensus picture whereby force separates the binding domain from an inhibitor domain, effectively triggering an allosteric conformational change in the former. This force-induced allostery is thought to be responsible for an increased binding affinity at the core of the catch-bond mechanism. However, some important questions remain, the most challenging one being that the crystal structures corresponding to these two allosteric states show almost superimposable binding-site geometries, which questions the molecular origin for the large difference in affinity. Using molecular dynamics with a combination of enhanced-sampling techniques, we demonstrate that the static picture provided by the crystal structures conceals a variety of binding-site conformations that have a key impact on the apparent affinity. Crucially, the respective populations in each of these conformations are very different between the two allosteric states of the binding domain, which can then be related to experimental affinity measurements. We also evidence a previously unappreciated but important effect: in addition to the well-established role of the force as an allosteric regulator via domain separation, application of force tends to directly favor the high-affinity binding-site conformations. We hypothesize that this additional local catch-bond effect could delay unbinding between the bacteria and the host cell before the global allosteric transition occurs, as well as stabilizing the complex even more once in the high-affinity allosteric state.",

    "abstract": "The lag phase is a temporary non-replicative period observed when a microbial population is introduced to a new nutrient-rich environment. Its duration can have a pronounced effect on population fitness, and it is often measured in laboratory conditions. However, calculating the lag phase length may be challenging and method and parameters dependent. Moreover, the details of these methods and parameters used throughout experimental studies are often under-reported. Here we discuss the most frequently used methods in experimental and theoretical studies, and we point out some inconsistencies between them. Using experimental and simulated data we study the performance of these methods depending on the frequency of population size measurements, and parameters determining the growth curve shape, such as growth rate. It turns out that the sensitivity to each of these parameters depends on the lag calculation methods. For example, lag duration calculation by parameter fitting to a logistic model is very robust to low frequency of measurements, but it may be highly biased for growth curves with low growth rate. On the contrary, the method based on finding the point where growth acceleration is the highest, is robust to low growth rate, but highly sensitive to low frequency of measurements and the level of noise in the data. Based on our results, we propose a decision tree to choose a method most suited to ones data. Finally, we developed a web tool where the lag duration can be calculated based on the user-specified growth curve data, and for various explicitly specified methods, parameters, and data pre-processing techniques.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=100 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/516631v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1867dc4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab04fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d43aaeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58963f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is an indispensable component of the human body. Alteration in the gut microbiota composition leads to various diseases such as obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, Inflammatory Bowel Syndrome, and depression. Microbiome-based precision tests offer a futuristic strategy for wellness and longevity. However, this approach is limited by the lack of definition of a healthy microbiome in different populations and accurate disease prediction.\n\nIn this study, we aimed to capture the healthy gut microbiome for different populations using the xNARA Gut Profile Test kit and in-house built proprietary algorithm and reference databases. We found that gut microbiome of different populations from India, UAE, and Singapore varied significantly, indicating a distinct geographic gut microbiome signature and Gut Health Index. The gut microbial diversity as measured by the Shannon index revealed UAE had significantly greater alpha diversity than India and Singapore. Prevotella copri (19.27%), Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (4.08%) and Levilactobacillus brevis (4.0%) were the predominant species in the Indian gut. Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (8.54%), Blautia obeum (8.10%), and Phocaeicola vulgatus (4.6%) were primarily present in Singapore participants whereas Prevotella copri (14.92%), Blautia obeum (6.09%) and Roseburia intestinalis (5.81%) were present in UAE participants. Beta diversity indicated the gut microbiota of Indian-origin participants in Singapore and UAE clustered with the indigenous inhabitants of Singapore and UAE. This highlights that geographic location has a profound effect on shaping the gut microbiome architecture than ethnicity. Regional diet and lifestyle could be crucial factors responsible for shaping the gut microbiome. The prediction accuracy of the xNARA Gut algorithm ranged from 66.66-100% when matched with the blood reports. Participants agreed with the xNARA disease risk outcomes for metabolic conditions (60%-100%), gastrofitness (62.5%-100%), mental health (50%-100%), skin conditions (50%-100%) and physical fitness (50%-100%). These observations imply the promising role of gut-based personalized diet and probiotic recommendations for lifestyle and wellness management.",

    "abstract": "NorQ, a member of the MoxR-class of AAA+ ATPases, and NorD, a protein containing a Von Willebrand Factor Type A (VWA) domain, are essential for non-heme iron (FeB) cofactor insertion into cytochrome c-dependent nitric oxide reductase (cNOR). cNOR catalyzes the NO reduction, a key step of bacterial denitrification. This work aimed at elucidating the specific mechanism of NorQD-catalyzed FeB insertion, and the general mechanism of the MoxR/VWA interacting protein families. We show that NorQ-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis, an intact VWA-domain in NorD and specific surface carboxylates on cNOR are all features required for cNOR activation. Supported by BN-PAGE, low-resolution cryo-EM structures of NorQ and the NorQD complex show that NorQ forms a circular hexamer with a monomer of NorD binding both to the side and to the central pore of the NorQ ring. Guided by AlphaFold predictions, we assign the density that  plugs the NorQ ring pore to the VWA domain of NorD with a protruding  finger inserting through the pore, and suggest this binding mode to be general for MoxR/VWA couples. We present a tentative model for the mechanism of NorQD-catalyzed cNOR remodelling and suggest many of its features to be applicable to the whole MoxR/VWA family.",
