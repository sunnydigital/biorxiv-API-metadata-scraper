    "abstract": "Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are indispensable for maintaining self-tolerance by suppressing conventional T cells. On the other hand, Tregs promote tumor growth by inhibiting anti-cancer immunity. In this study, we identified that Tregs increase the quorum of self-reactive CD8+ T cells required for the induction of experimental autoimmune diabetes. Their major suppression mechanism is limiting available IL-2, an essential T-cell cytokine. Specifically, Tregs inhibit the formation of a previously uncharacterized subset of antigen-stimulated KLRK1+ IL7R+ (KILR) CD8+ effector T cells, which are distinct from conventional effector CD8+ T cells. KILR CD8+ T cells show a superior cell killing abilities in vivo. The administration of agonistic IL-2 immunocomplexes phenocopies the absence of Tregs, i.e., it induces KILR CD8+ T cells, promotes autoimmunity, and enhances anti-tumor responses. Counterparts of KILR CD8+ T cells were found in the human blood, revealing them as a potential target for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "The Michaelis-Menten (MM) rate law has been the dominant paradigm of modeling biochemical rate processes for over a century with applications in biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, systems biology, and chemical engineering. The MM rate law and its remedied form stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) much faster than the molecular concentrations change. Yet, this assumption is not always justified. Here, we relax this quasi-steady state requirement and propose the generalized MM rate law for the interactions of molecules with active concentration changes over time. Our approach for time-varying molecular concentrations, termed the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), is based on rigorously estimated time-delay effects in molecular complex formation. With particularly marked improvements in protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction modeling, the ETS provides an analytical framework to interpret and predict rich transient or rhythmic dynamics (such as autogenously-regulated cellular adaptation and circadian protein turnover), which goes beyond the quasi-steady state assumption.",

    "abstract": "Male homosexual orientation remains a Darwinian paradox, as there is no consensus on its evolutionary (ultimate) determinants. One intriguing feature of homosexual men is their higher male birth rank compared to heterosexual men. This can be explained by two non-exclusive mechanisms: an antagonistic effect (AE), implying that more fertile women have a higher chance of having a homosexual son and to produce children with a higher mean birth rank, or a fraternal birth effect (FBOE), where each additional older brother increases the chances for a male embryo to develop a homosexual orientation due to an immunoreactivity process. However, there is no consensus on whether both FBOE and AE are present in human populations, or if only one of these mechanisms is at play with its effect mimicking the signature of the other mechanism. An additional sororal birth order effect (SBOE) has also recently been proposed. To clarify this situation, we developed theoretical and statistical tools to study FBOE and AE independently or in combination, taking into account all known sampling biases. These tools were applied on new individual data, and on various available published data (two individual datasets, and all relevant aggregated data). Support for FBOE was apparent in aggregated data, with the FBOE increasing linearly with fertility. The FBOE was also supported in two individual datasets. An SBOE is generated when sampling in presence of FBOE, suggesting that controlling for FBOE is required to avoid artefactual SBOE. AE was not supported in individual datasets, including the analysis of the extended maternal family. The evolutionary implications of these findings are discussed.",

    "abstract": "A major ongoing research effort seeks to understand the behavior, ecology and control of the spotted lanternfly (SLF) (Lycorma delicatula), a highly invasive pest in the U.S. and South Korea. These insects undergo four nymphal stages (instars) before reaching adulthood, and appear to shift host plant preferences, feeding, dispersal and survival patterns, anti-predator behaviors, and response to traps and chemical controls with each stage. However, categorizing SLF life stage is challenging for the first three instars, which have the same coloration and shape, because no comprehensive datasets exist. We present a dataset of body mass and length for SLF nymphs throughout two growing seasons and compare our results with previously-published ranges of instar body lengths. An analysis using two clustering methods revealed that 1st-3rd instar body mass and length fell into distinct clusters that were consistent between years, supporting using these metrics to stage nymphs during a single growing season. However, the ranges for 2nd-4th instars were not consistent between our results and those from earlier studies for diverse locations. The scaling of SLF nymph body mass with body length varied between isometry (constant shape) and positive allometry (growing faster than predicted by isometry) in the two years studied. Using previously published data, we also found that SLF nymph adhesive footpad area varies in direct proportion to weight, suggesting that footpad adhesion is independent of nymphal stage, while their tarsal claws display positive allometry and hence disproportionately increasing grasp (mechanical adhesion). By contrast, mouthpart dimensions are weakly correlated with body length, consistent with predictions that these features should reflect preferred host plant characteristics rather than body size. We recommend future studies use the body mass vs length growth curve as a fitness benchmark to study how SLF instar development depends on factors such as hatch date, host plant, temperature, and geographic location, to further understanding of life history patterns that help prevent further spread of this invasive insect.",

Head direction cells in distributed brain regions receive a range of sensory inputs, but visual input is particularly important for aligning their responses to environmental landmarks. To investigate how population-level heading responses are aligned to visual input, we recorded from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of head-fixed mice in a moving environment using two-photon calcium imaging. We show that RSC neurons are tuned to the animals relative orientation in the environment, even in the absence of head movement. Next, we found that RSC receives functionally distinct projections from visual and thalamic areas, and contains several functional classes of neurons. While some functional classes mirror RSC inputs, a newly discovered class coregisters visual and thalamic signals. Finally, decoding analyses reveal unique contributions to heading from each class. Our results suggest an RSC circuit for anchoring heading representations to environmental visual landmarks.",

We characterized the distinct cell states of AMN and PMP using single-cell RNA-sequencing in 31 samples including AMNs, PMP metastases and matched normal tissues. We identified previously undescribed cellular features and heterogeneity in AMN and PMP. We discovered developmental cell states in tumor epithelial cells that ranged from progenitor phase to goblet cell differentiation, which was accompanied by elevated mucin gene expression. Metastatic PMP cells had a distinct cell state with increased mTOR and RAS signaling pathways and a series of upregulated cancer genes. We observed heterogeneity in a single PMP tumor as well as PMP metastases from the same patient.

    "abstract": "Humans make a number of choices when they walk, such as how fast and for how long. The preferred steady walking speed seems chosen to minimize energy expenditure per distance traveled. But the speed of actual walking bouts is not only steady, but rather a time-varying trajectory, which can also be modulated by task urgency or an individuals movement vigor. Here we show that speed trajectories and durations of human walking bouts are explained better by an objective to minimize Energy and Time, meaning the total work or energy to reach destination, plus a cost proportional to bout duration. Applied to a computational model of walking dynamics, this objective predicts dynamic speed vs. time trajectories with inverted U shapes. Model and human experiment (N = 10) show that shorter bouts are unsteady and dominated by the time and effort of accelerating, and longer ones are steadier and faster due to energy-per-distance. Individual-dependent vigor may be characterized by the energy one is willing to spend to save a unit of time, which explains why some may walk faster than others, but everyone may have similar-shaped trajectories due to similar walking dynamics. Tradeoffs between energy and time costs can predict transient, steady, and vigor-related aspects of walking.",

    "abstract": "Background & SummaryIn addition to being the model plant used by Mendel1 to establish genetic laws, pea (Pisum sativum L.) is a major pulse crop cultivated in many temperate regions of the world. In order to face new challenges imposed particularly by global climate change and new regulations targeted at reducing chemical inputs, pea breeders have to take advantage of the genetic diversity present in the Pisum genepool to develop improved, resilient varieties. The aim of this study was to assess the genetic diversity of a pea germplasm collection and allow genome-wide association studies using this collection.\n\nTo be able to perform genome-wide association approaches with high resolution, genotyping with a large set of genetic markers such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers well-spread over the genome is required. Rapid advances in second-generation sequencing technologies and the development of bioinformatic tools have revolutionized the access to and the characterization of available genetic diversity. High-density, high-throughput genotyping has been possible for a large number of species, including those with large and complex genomes2 such as pea which genome size is estimated to be 4.45 Gb3. In this study, which is part of the PeaMUST project4, we used a target capture technology based on pea transcriptome sequences to generate exome-enriched genomic libraries that were further subjected to Illumina sequencing in paired-end mode. This methodology was chosen because whole-genome resequencing is relatively expensive for species with large genomes and because capturing genetic variations in repeated non-coding regions is difficult to achieve or to interpret5. Whole-exome sequencing represented an interesting alternative that focused on coding regions only6,7. Mapping the obtained reads on the reference pea genome sequence enabled the discovery of an abundant set of SNPs. The development of this resource is a crucial cornerstone in research and breeding projects towards boosting the improvement of pea production and quality.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTo achieve replicative immortality, most cancers develop a telomere maintenance mechanism, such as reactivation of telomerase or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). There are limited data on the prevalence and clinical significance of ALT in pediatric brain tumors, and ALT-directed therapy is not available.\n\nMethodsWe performed C-circle analysis (CCA) on 579 pediatric brain tumors that had corresponding tumor/normal whole genome sequencing through the Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (OpenPBTA). We detected ALT in 6.9% (n=40/579) of these tumors and completed additional validation by ultrabright telomeric foci in situ on a subset of these tumors. We used CCA to validate TelomereHunter for computational prediction of ALT status and focus subsequent analyses on pediatric high-grade glioma (pHGG) Finally, we examined whether ALT is associated with recurrent somatic or germline alterations.\n\nResultsALT is common in pHGG (n=24/63, 38.1%), but occurs infrequently in other pediatric brain tumors (<3%). Somatic ATRX mutations occur in 50% of ALT+ pHGG and in 30% of ALT-pHGG. Rare pathogenic germline variants in mismatch repair (MMR) genes are significantly associated with an increased occurrence of ALT. Conclusions: We demonstrate that ATRX is mutated in only a subset of ALT+ pHGG, suggesting other mechanisms of ATRX loss of function or alterations in other genes may be associated with the development of ALT in these patients. We show that germline variants in MMR are associated with development of ALT in patients with pHGG.\n\nKey PointsATRX alterations are frequent, but not required, for an ALT phenotype in pHGGs\n\npHGG patients with germline mismatch repair variants have higher rate of ALT + tumors TelomereHunter is validated to predict ALT in pHGGs\n\nImportance of the StudyWe performed orthogonal molecular and computational analyses to detect the presence of alternative lengthening of telomeres in a highly characterized cohort of pediatric brain tumors. We demonstrate that many pHGG utilize ALT without a mutation in ATRX, suggesting either loss of function of ATRX via an alternative mechanism or an alternate means of development of ALT. We show that germline variants in MMR genes are significantly associated with ALT in pHGG. Our work adds to the biological understanding of the development of ALT and provides an approach to stratify patients who may benefit from future ALT-directed therapies in this patient population.",

We aimed to investigate the neural correlates of different cognitive processes evolving over time during interpersonal predictive coding. Thirty-nine participants watched two agents depicted by moving point-light stimuli while an electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. One well-recognizable agent performed either a  communicative or an  individual action. The second agent either was blended into a cluster of noise dots (i.e., present), or was entirely replaced by noise dots (i.e., absent), which participants had to differentiate. EEG amplitude and coherence analyses for theta, alpha and beta frequency bands revealed a dynamic pattern unfolding over time: Watching communicative actions was associated with enhanced coupling within medial anterior regions involved in social and mentalizing processes and with dorsolateral prefrontal activation indicating a higher deployment of cognitive resources. Trying to detect the agent in the cluster of noise dots without having seen communicative cues was related to enhanced coupling in posterior regions for social perception and visual processing. Observing an expected outcome was modulated by motor system activation. Finally, when the agent was detected correctly, activation in posterior areas for visual processing of socially-relevant features was increased. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is crucial to consider the temporal dynamics of social interactions and of their neural correlates to better understand interpersonal predictive coding. This could lead to optimized treatment approaches for individuals with problems in social interactions.",

It is a common cause of nosocomial infections, and is particularly troublesome due to extensive intrinsic and acquired antimicrobial resistance.

Resistance was characterised by mutations in bacterial pathways responsive to cell envelope stress. Drosophila-adapted strains exhibited changes in sensitivity to relevant antimicrobials, including daptomycin and vancomycin. Evolved daptomycin-resistant strains harboured mutations in the same signalling systems, with some strains showing increased virulence similar to Drosophila-adapted strains. Our results show that common mechanisms provide a route to resistance to both antimicrobials and host immunity in E. faecalis and demonstrate that the selection and emergence of antibiotic resistance in vivo does not require antibiotic exposure.\n\nOne sentence summaryHost interaction can promote antimicrobial resistance and antimicrobial treatment can promote virulence in E. faecalis.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in simple sequence repeat loci underlie many inherited disorders in humans, and are increasingly recognized as important determinants of natural phenotypic variation. In eukaryotes, mutations in these sequences are primarily repaired by the MutS{beta} mismatch repair complex. To better understand the role of this complex in mismatch repair and the determinants of simple sequence repeat mutation predisposition, we performed mutation accumulation in yeast strains with abrogated MutS{beta} function. We demonstrate that mutations in simple sequence repeat loci in the absence of mismatch repair are primarily deletions. We also show that mutations accumulate at drastically different rates in short (<8 bp) and longer repeat loci. These data lend support to a model in which the mismatch repair complex is responsible for repair primarily in longer simple sequence repeats.",

    "abstract": "Myelinated axons (nerve fibers) efficiently transmit signals throughout the brain via action potentials. Multiple methods that are sensitive to axon orientations, from microscopy to magnetic resonance imaging, aim to reconstruct the brains structural connectome. As billions of nerve fibers traverse the brain with various possible geometries at each point, resolving fiber crossings is necessary to generate accurate structural connectivity maps. However, doing so with specificity is a challenging task because signals originating from oriented fibers can be influenced by brain (micro)structures unrelated to myelinated axons.\n\nX-ray scattering can specifically probe myelinated axons due to the periodicity of the myelin sheath, which yields distinct peaks in the scattering pattern. Here, we show that small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can be used to detect myelinated, axon-specific fiber crossings. We first demonstrate the capability using strips of human corpus callosum to create artificial double- and triple-crossing fiber geometries, and we then apply the method in mouse, pig, vervet monkey, and human brains. Given its specificity, capability of 3-dimensional sampling and high resolution, SAXS can serve as a ground truth for validating MRI as well as microscopy-based methods.\n\nStatement of SignificanceTo study how the nerve fibers in our brain are interconnected, scientists need to visualize their trajectories, which often cross one another. Here, we show the unique capacity of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to study these fiber crossings without use of labelling, taking advantage of SAXSs specificity to myelin - the insulating sheath that is wrapped around nerve fibers. We use SAXS to detect double and triple crossing fibers and unveil intricate crossings in mouse, pig, vervet monkey, and human brains. This non-destructive method can uncover complex fiber trajectories and validate other less specific imaging methods (e.g., MRI or microscopy), towards accurate mapping of neuronal connectivity in the animal and human brain.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510198v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@479368org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11eb0c9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e883adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ce024_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe first cause of mortality worldwide is ischemic heart disease. In myocardial infarction (MI), the ischemic event causes cell death, which triggers a large inflammatory response responsible for removing necrotic material and inducing tissue repair. Endothelial cells, immune cells and fibroblasts play a key role in orchestrating this healing process. TRPM4 is a Ca2+-activated ion channel permeable to monovalent cations and its silencing or knocking out was shown to critically modify cellular functions of these non-myocytic cell types.\n\nOBJECTIVEOur aims were to 1) evaluate the role of TRPM4 on mice survival and cardiac function after MI; and 2) investigate the role of TRPM4 in the post-MI acute and chronic inflammatory response.\n\nMETHODSWe performed ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery or sham intervention on 154 Trpm4 WT or KO male mice and monitored survival for up to 5 weeks as well as cardiac function using echocardiography at 72h and five weeks. We drew blood at different acute time points (6h, 12h, 24h) and performed time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze the sera proteomes. Further, we sacrificed sub-groups of mice at 24h and 72h after surgery and performed single-cell RNA sequencing on the non-myocytic cells. Lastly, we assessed fibrosis and angiogenesis at five weeks using type I collagen and CD31 immunostaining respectively.\n\nRESULTSWe observed no significant differences in survival or cardiac function post-MI between both genotypes. However, our serum proteomics data showed significantly decreased tissue injury markers such as creatine kinase M and VE-Cadherin in KO compared to WT 12h after MI. On the other hand, inflammation characterized by serum amyloid P component in the serum, as well as higher number of recruited granulocytes, M1 macrophages, M1 monocytes, Mac-6 macrophages, and expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as Il1b, Lyz2 and S100a8/a9 was significantly higher in endothelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts of KO than of WT. This correlated with increased cardiac fibrosis and angiogenesis 5 weeks after MI in KO.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur data suggest that knocking out Trpm4 drastically increases acute inflammation post-MI, is associated with increased chronic fibrosis and does not improve survival at 5 weeks post-MI. Thus, targeting TRPM4 in the context of MI should be pondered carefully and approaches that nuance the timing of the inhibition or cellular target may be required.",

Protein turnover varies across proteins, cellular compartments, cell types, and tissues. In the brain, circuit-specific protein turnover is thought to underlie synaptic plasticity, but current methods to track protein turnover lack cellular or subcellular resolution. We describe a pulse-chase method (DELTA) to measure protein turnover with high spatial and temporal resolution throughout the body. DELTA relies on the rapid covalent capture by HaloTag of fluorescent ligands optimized for bioavailability in vivo, overcoming the unique challenges associated with labeling in the brain. We found that the nuclear protein MeCP2 showed brain-region- and cell-type-specific turnover, and the synaptic protein PSD95 was destabilized in specific brain regions following behavioral enrichment. A new variant of expansion microscopy enabled turnover measurements at individual synapses. DELTA will enable studies of adaptive and maladaptive plasticity in brain-wide neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Recently, distinct mutational footprints observed in metastatic tumors, secondary malignancies and normal human tissues have been demonstrated to be caused by the exposure to several chemotherapeutic drugs. These characteristic mutations originate from specific lesions caused by these chemicals to the DNA of exposed cells. However, it is unknown whether the exposure to these chemotherapies leads to a specific footprint of larger chromosomal aberrations. Here, we address this question exploiting whole genome sequencing data of metastatic tumors obtained from patients exposed to different chemotherapeutic drugs. As a result, we discovered a specific copy number footprint across tumors from patients previously exposed to platinum-based therapies. This footprint is characterized by a significant increase in the number of chromosomal fragments of copy number 1-4 and size smaller than 10 Mb in exposed tumors with respect to their unexposed counterparts (median 14-387% greater across tumor types). The number of chromosomal fragments characteristic of the platinum-associated CN footprint increases significantly with the activity of the well known platinum-related footprint of single nucleotide variants across exposed tumors.",

    "abstract": "Recent years have demonstrated the feasibility of using intracortical Brain-Machine Interfaces (iBMIs), by decoding thoughts, for communication and cursor control tasks. iBMIs are increasingly becoming wireless due to the risk of infection and mechanical failure, typically associated with percutaneous connections. The wireless communication itself, however, increases the power consumption further; with the total dissipation being strictly limited due to safety heating limits of cortical tissue. Since wireless power is typically proportional to the communication bandwidth, the output Bit Rate (BR) must be minimised. Whilst most iBMIs utilise Multi-Unit activity (MUA), i.e. spike events, and this in itself significantly reduces the output BR (compared to raw data), it still limits the scalability (number of channels) that can be achieved. As such, additional compression for MUA signals are essential for fully-implantable, high-information-bandwidth systems. To meet this need, this work proposes various hardware-efficient, ultra-low power MUA compression schemes. We investigate them in terms of their BRs and hardware requirements as a function of various on-implant conditions such as MUA Binning Period (BP) and number of channels. It was found that for BPs [&le;] 10 ms, the delta-asynchronous method had the lowest total power and reduced the BR by almost an order of magnitude relative to classical methods (e.g. to approx. 151 bps/channel for a BP of 1 ms and 1000 channels on-implant.). However, at larger BPs the synchronous method performed best (e.g. approx. 29 bps/channel for a BP of 50 ms, independent of channel count). As such, this work can guide the choice of MUA data compression scheme for BMI applications, where the BR can be significantly reduced in hardware efficient ways. This enables the next generation of wireless iBMIs, with small implant sizes, high channel counts, low-power, and small hardware footprint. All code and results have been made publicly available.",

We devised a metric of cellular metabolic rate (cMR), rMR optimally fit to the number of microRNA families (miRNA.Fam), that is robust to variation in mass and sensitive to body temperature, consistent with the heat dissipation limit theory of Speakman and Krol (2010). Relatively abrupt increases in miRNA.Fam and cMR in later-branching, permanently homeothermic Boreoeutheria led us to postulate the emergence of new optimum in the adaptive landscape. With miRNA.Fam as predictor, simulation of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process of stabilizing selection, together with an adaptive shift between Atlantogenata and Boreoeutheria, accounted for 95% of the variation in cMR. Branchwise rates of evolution of cMR, miRNA.Fam and body temperature concurrently increased 6- to 7-fold, independent of the evolution of mass. Cellular MR variation across placental mammals was also predicted by the energy spared by model conserved microRNA-target interactions, revealing an unexpected degree of integration of the microRNA-target apparatus into the energy economy of the mammalian cell.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenotyping-by-Sequencing (GBS) provides affordable methods for genotyping hundreds of individuals using millions of markers. However, this challenges bioinformatic procedures that must overcome possible artifacts such as the bias gen-erated by PCR duplicates and sequencing errors. Genotyping errors lead to data that deviate from what is expected from regular meiosis. This, in turn, leads to difficul-ties in grouping and ordering markers resulting in inflated and incorrect linkage maps. Therefore, genotyping errors can be easily detected by linkage map quality evaluations.\n\nResultsWe developed and used the Reads2Map workflow to build linkage maps with simulated and empirical GBS data of diploid outcrossing populations. The workflows run GATK, Stacks, TASSEL, and Freebayes for SNP calling and updog, polyRAD, and SuperMASSA for genotype calling, and OneMap and GUSMap to build linkage maps. Using simulated data, we observed which genotype call software fails in identifying common errors in GBS sequencing data and proposed specific filters to better handle them. We tested whether it is possible to overcome errors in a linkage map using genotype prob-abilities from each software or global error rates to estimate genetic distances with an updated version of OneMap. We also evaluated the impact of segregation distortion, con-taminant samples, and haplotype-based multiallelic markers in the final linkage maps. Through our evaluations, we observed that some of the approaches produce different results depending on the dataset (dataset-dependent) and others produce consistent advantageous results among them (dataset-independent).\n\nConclusionsWe set as default in the Reads2Map workflows the approaches that showed to be dataset-independent for GBS datasets according to our results. This reduces the number required of tests to identify optimal pipelines and parameters for other empirical datasets. Using Reads2Map, users can select the pipeline and parameters that best fit their data context.

    "abstract": "In fungi, a phenomenon termed heterokaryon incompatibility restricts hyphal fusion to occur within an individual since fusion between individuals leads to cell death. Generally, the genes involved are found to be under balancing selection from negative frequency dependent fitness. Here, we assess this in Aspergillus fumigatus, a human pathogenic fungus with an extremely high crossover rate. Using auxotrophic markers we screened sexual progeny for compatibility to identify genes involved in this process, the so-called het genes. In total, 5/148 (3.4%) offspring were compatible with a parent and 166/2142 (7.7%) sibling pairs were compatible, consistent with several segregating incompatibility loci. Genetic mapping resulted in five loci, four of which could be fine mapped to individual genes, of which we tested three through heterologous expression, confirming their causal relationship. Surprisingly, a population-level analysis of two available independent datasets did not show an increase in Tajimas D near these loci, normally a hallmark of balancing selection. However, analysis of closely related species did show trans-species polymorphisms across >10 million years, and equal allele frequencies within A. fumigatus. Using available de novo assemblies, we show that these balanced polymorphisms are restricted to within several hundred base pairs flanking the coding sequence, potentially due to this species high crossover rate. In addition to identifying the first het genes in an Aspergillus species, this work highlights the interaction of long-term balancing selection with a high recombination rate. Future mechanistic work on these het genes may provide novel routes for clinical therapies, as well as opportunities for strain improvement in biotechnology.",

    "abstract": "N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome together with a reduction of NMDAR. Although in most patients the life-threatening symptoms of the acute stage resolve with immunotherapy, memory and executive functions remain altered for several months or years. A mechanistic explanation for these long-lasting cognitive effects is still lacking and previous animal models have not explored this effect.\n\nHere, we combined repeat calcium imaging of the same population of hundreds of hippocampal CA1 neurons for three months along with two behavioral tasks to assess retrograde and anterograde memory loss using a reported mouse model of cerebroventricular transfer of patients CSF antibodies. We measured how memory-related neuronal activity is affected by the presence of NMDAR antibodies during the induction of the model and its long-lasting recovery. In addition, we developed a computational model that provides a mechanistic explanation for the long-term antibody-mediated impairment of memory.\n\nThe findings show that the presence of antibodies leads to an increase of CA1 neuronal firing rate, resulting in a reduction of the amount of information encoded by these cells. Furthermore, the antibodies cause a degradation of the hippocampal neuronal response stability over time, providing a neural correlate of memory dysfunction. All these neuronal alterations span the 3 months of recordings, and in some cases beyond the last recording point. The computational model shows that a reduction of NMDAR is sufficient to cause the changes observed in neuronal activity, including the different involvement of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 neurons.\n\nAltogether, we show that the antibody-mediated reduction of NMDAR leads to long-term changes in hippocampal neuronal activity which extend far beyond the antibody clearance, providing a mechanism that can account for the cognitive deficits observed in the protracted recovery of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis.",

    "abstract": "Computer vision and deep learning (DL) techniques have succeeded in a wide range of diverse fields. Recently, these techniques have been successfully deployed in plant science applications to address food security, productivity, and environmental sustainability problems for a growing global population. However, training these DL models often necessitates the large-scale manual annotation of data which frequently becomes a tedious and time-and-resource-intensive process. Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have proven instrumental in overcoming these obstacles, using purely unlabeled datasets to pre-train DL models. Here, we implement the popular self-supervised contrastive learning methods of NNCLR (Nearest neighbor Contrastive Learning of visual Representations) and SimCLR (Simple framework for Contrastive Learning of visual Representations) for the classification of spatial orientation and segmentation of embryos of maize kernels. Maize kernels are imaged using a commercial high-throughput imaging system. This image data is often used in multiple downstream applications across both production and breeding applications, for instance, sorting for oil content based on segmenting and quantifying the scutellums size and for classifying haploid and diploid kernels. We show that in both classification and segmentation problems, SSL techniques outperform their purely supervised transfer learning-based counterparts and are significantly more annotation efficient. Additionally, we show that a single SSL pre-trained model can be efficiently finetuned for both classification and segmentation, indicating good transferability across multiple downstream applications. Segmentation models with SSL-pretrained backbones produce DICE similarity coefficients of 0.81, higher than the 0.78 and 0.73 of those with ImageNet-pretrained and randomly initialized backbones, respectively. We observe that finetuning classification and segmentation models on as little as 1% annotation produces competitive results. These results show SSL provides a meaningful step forward in data efficiency with agricultural deep learning and computer vision.",

    "abstract": "Simple, soil-free assays that can mimic drought conditions are incredibly useful for investigating plant stress responses. Due to their ease of use, the research community often relies on polyethylene glycol (PEG), mannitol and salt treatments to simulate drought conditions in the laboratory. However, while these types of osmotic stress can create phenotypes that resemble those of drought, it remains unclear how they compare at the molecular level. Here, using transcriptomics, we demonstrate that these assays are unable to replicate drought signaling responses in the Arabidopsis root. Indeed, we found a significant number of genes that were induced by drought were in fact repressed by such treatments. Since our results question the utility of PEG, mannitol and salt, we designed a new method for simulating drought. By simply adding less water to agar, our  low-water agar assay elicits gene expression responses that compare more favorably to drought stress. Furthermore, we show our approach can be leveraged as a high-throughput assay to investigate natural variation in drought responses.",

    "abstract": "The level of a given protein is determined by rates of mRNA and protein synthesis and degradation. The reliable quantification of these rates is thus essential to understand how protein levels are regulated. While several studies have quantified the contribution of different steps of gene expression in regulating protein levels, these are limited by the use of equilibrium approximations when studying out-of-equilibrium biological systems. Here we introduce flux analysis to quantify the contribution of gene expression steps to regulate the dynamics of the expression level for specific proteins. We use flux analysis to analyze a published RNA-seq and proteomics dataset of mouse bone marrow-derived DCs stimulated with LPS. Our analysis revealed six regulatory modalities shared by sets of genes with clear functional signatures. We also find that protein degradation plays a stronger role than expected in the adaptation of protein levels to LPS stimulation. These findings suggest that shared regulatory strategies can lead to versatile responses at the protein level and highlight the importance of going beyond steady-state approximations to uncover the dynamic contribution of different steps of gene expression to protein levels.",

Here, we first demonstrate that thin dendritic branches are well suited to implementing contextual modulation of feedforward processing. Such neuron-specific modulations exploit prior knowledge, encoded in stable feedforward weights, to achieve transfer learning across contexts. In a network of biophysically realistic neuron models with context-independent feedforward weights, we show that modulatory inputs to thin dendrites can solve linearly non-separable learning problems with a Hebbian, error-modulated learning rule. Finally, we demonstrate that local prediction of whether representations originate either from different inputs, or from different contextual modulations of the same input, results in representation learning of hierarchical feedforward weights across processing layers that accommodate a multitude of contexts.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive demand is thought to modulate two often used, but rarely combined, measures: pupil size and neural alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillatory power. However, it is unclear whether these two measures capture cognitive demand in a similar way under complex audio-visual task conditions. Here we recorded pupil size and neural alpha power (using electroencephalography), while human participants of both sexes concurrently performed a visual multiple object-tracking task and an auditory gap-detection task. Difficulties of the two tasks were manipulated independent of each other. Participants performance decreased in accuracy and speed with increasing cognitive demand. Pupil size increased with increasing difficulty for both the auditory and the visual task. In contrast, alpha power showed diverging neural dynamics: Parietal alpha power decreased with increasing difficulty in the visual task, but not with increasing difficulty in the auditory task. Furthermore, independent of task difficulty, within-participant trial-by-trial fluctuations in pupil size were negatively correlated with alpha power. Difficulty-induced changes in pupil size and alpha power, however, did not correlate, which is consistent with their different cognitive-demand sensitivities. Overall, the current study demonstrates that the dynamics of the neurophysiological indices of cognitive demand and associated effort are multi-faceted and potentially modality-dependent under complex audio-visual task conditions.\n\nSignificance StatementPupil size and oscillatory alpha power are associated with cognitive demand and effort, but their relative sensitivity under complex audio-visual task conditions is unclear as is the extent to which they share underlying mechanisms. Using an audio-visual dual-task paradigm, we show that pupil size increases with increasing cognitive demands for both audition and vision. In contrast, changes in oscillatory alpha power depend on the respective task demands: Parietal alpha power decreases with visual demand but not with auditory task demand. Hence, pupil size and alpha power show different sensitivity to cognitive demands, perhaps suggesting partly different underlying neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Neuroscience is pushing toward studying the brain during naturalistic behaviors with open-ended tasks. Grid cells are a classic example, where free behavior was key to observing their characteristic spatial representations in two-dimensional environments [1]. In contrast, it has been difficult to identify grid cells and study their computations in more restrictive experiments, such as head-fixed wheel running [2-6]. Here, we challenge this view by showing that shifting the focus from single neurons to the population level changes the minimal experimental complexity required to study grid cell representations. Specifically, we combine the manifold approximation in UMAP [7] with persistent homology [8] to study the topology of the population activity. With these methods, we show that the population activity of grid cells covers a similar two-dimensional toroidal state space during wheel running as in open field foraging [9, 10], with and without a virtual reality setup. Trajectories on the torus correspond to single trial runs in virtual reality and changes in experimental conditions are reflected in the internal representation, while the toroidal representation undergoes occasional shifts in its alignment to the environment. These findings show that our method can uncover latent topologies that go beyond the complexity of the task, allowing us to investigate internal dynamics in simple experimental settings in which the analysis of grid cells has so far remained elusive.",

Here, for the first time, we investigated whether voluntary regulation of VWFA activity is feasible using real-time fMRI neurofeedback. 40 adults with typical reading skills were instructed to either upregulate (UP group) or downregulate (DOWN group) their own VWFA activity during six neurofeedback training runs. The VWFA target region was individually defined based on a functional localizer task. Before and after training, also regulation runs without feedback (\"no-feedback runs\") were performed.\n\nWhen comparing the two groups, we found stronger activity across the whole reading network, including the VWFA, for the UP than the DOWN group. Crucially, we observed a significant interaction of group and time (pre, post) for the no-feedback runs: The two groups did not differ in their VWFA activity before neurofeedback training, but the UP group showed significantly stronger activity than the DOWN group after neurofeedback training. Our results indicate that self-regulation of the VWFA activity is feasible and that, once learned, successful self-regulation can even be performed in the absence of feedback. These results are a crucial step toward to development of a potential clinical intervention to improve reading skills in individuals with reading impairments.",

This contraction bias has been extensively studied in psychophysics, but little is known about its origin from neural activity. By training recurrent networks of spiking neurons to discriminate temporal intervals, we explored the causes of this bias and how behavior relates to population firing activity. We found that the trained networks exhibited animal-like behavior. Various geometric features of neural trajectories in state space encoded warped representations of the durations of the first interval modulated by sensory history. Formulating a novel normative model, we showed that these representations conveyed a Bayesian estimate of the interval durations, thus relating activity and behavior. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that Bayesian computations already occur during the sensory phase of the first stimulus and persist throughout its maintenance in working memory, until the time of stimulus comparison.",

Results (N=70) revealed a non-additive benefit of both components of eye movements to memory performance. Additionally, we found that individuals who gained from one component, were more likely to gain from the other as well.

    "abstract": "There is increasing evidence of sex differences in underlying mechanisms causing pain in preclinical models, and in clinical populations. There are also important disconnects between clinical pain populations and the way preclinical pain studies are conducted. For instance, osteoarthritis pain more frequently affects women but most preclinical studies have been conducted using males in animal models. The most widely used painkillers, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), act on the prostaglandin pathway by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the preclinical and clinical literature on the role of prostaglandins and COX in inflammation and pain. We aimed to specifically identify studies that used both sexes and investigate whether any sex-differences in the action of prostaglandins and COX inhibition had been reported, either in clinical or preclinical studies. We conducted a PubMed search and identified 369 preclinical studies and 100 clinical studies that matched our inclusion/exclusion criteria. Our analysis shows that only 17% of preclinical studies on prostaglandins used both sexes and, out of those, only 19% analyzed or reported data in a sex-aware fashion. In contrast, 79% of the clinical studies analyzed used both sexes. However, only 6% of those reported data in a sex-aware fashion. Interestingly, 14 out of 15 preclinical studies and 5 out of 6 clinical studies that analyzed data in a sex-aware fashion have identified sex-differences. This builds on the increasing evidence of sex-differences in prostaglandin signaling and the importance of sex-awareness in data analysis. The preclinical literature identifies a sex difference in prostaglandin D2 synthase (PTGDS) expression where it is higher in female than in male rodents in the nervous system. We experimentally validated that PTGDS expression is higher in female human dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons recovered from organ donors. Our semi-systematic literature review reveals a need for continued inclusivity of both male and female animals in prostaglandins studies and sex-aware analysis in data analysis in preclinical and clinical studies. Our finding of sex-differences in neuronal PTGDS expression in humans exemplifies the need for a more comprehensive understanding of how the prostaglandin system functions in the DRG in rodents and humans.",

We here evaluate an alternative design in which the drug is administered during an on-going scan (i.e., a displacement study). This approach results both in lower radiation exposure and lower costs. Existing kinetic models assume steady state. This condition is not present during a drug displacement and consequently, our aim here was to develop kinetic models for analysing PET displacement data.\n\nWe modified existing compartment models to accommodate a time-variant increase in occupancy following the pharmacological in-scan intervention. Since this implies the use of differential equations that cannot be solved analytically, we developed instead one approximate and one numerical solution. Through simulations, we show that if the occupancy is relatively high, it can be estimated without bias and with good accuracy. The models were applied to PET data from six pigs where [11C]UCB-J was displaced by intravenous brivaracetam. The dose-occupancy relationship estimated from these scans showed good agreement with occupancies calculated with Lassen plot applied to baseline-block scans of two pigs. In summary, the proposed models provide a framework to determine target occupancy from a single displacement scan.",

    "abstract": "In humans and animals, high frequency electrocutaneous stimulation (HFS) may produce an  early long-term potentiation-like sensitisation. Peripheral and central modulatory processes are proposed to play a role. To explore the impact of descending inhibitory pathway activation on the development of HFS-induced hyperalgesia, we concurrently applied HFS with i) a conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigm during psychophysical testing in humans, or ii) a diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) paradigm during in vivo electrophysiological recording of spinal neurones in anaesthetised animals in parallel studies that utilised identical stimuli. HFS induced enhanced perceptual responses to pin-prick stimuli in cutaneous areas secondary to the area of stimulation in humans and heightened the excitability of spinal neurones in rats (which exhibited stimulus intensity dependent coded responses to pin-prick stimulation in a manner that tracked with human psychophysics), where we also observed indicators of increased central neuronal hyperexcitability. In humans, a HFS(+CPM) paradigm did not alter primary or secondary hyperalgesia, and the area and pain intensity of secondary hyperalgesia did not correlate with temporal summation of pain or CPM magnitude, while in rats application of a DNIC paradigm concurrent to HFS did not impact the development of neuronal hyperexcitability. Concordance between human and rat data supports their translational validity. Our finding that excitatory signalling exceeds inhibitory controls suggests that dampening facilitatory mechanisms may be a preferable strategy for certain chronic pain states. If facilitatory mechanisms dominate, our data could explain why enhancing activity in descending inhibitory controls is not sufficient to induce pain relief in vulnerable patients.",

Here, using A1 overexpressing mice (A1-mice), we studied the effects of A1 on different populations of catecholaminergic neurons in the central (CNS) and the peripheral nervous systems (PNS). A1 overexpression increases the number of dopaminergic SNpc neurons and alters the striosome/matrix organization of the striatum. Interestingly, these numerical and morphological changes in the nigrostriatal pathway of A1-mice do not confer an altered susceptibility to experimental MPTP-parkinsonism with respect to wild type controls. Moreover, the study of the effects of A1 overexpression was extended to different dopaminergic tissues associated with the PNS, detecting a significant reduction in the number of dopaminergic chemosensitive carotid body glomus cells in A1-mice. Overall, these analyses confirm A1 as a principal regulator of the FGF pathway in the development and survival of dopaminergic neurons in different nuclei of the mammalian nervous system.",

    "abstract": "After fertilization, zygotic genome activation (ZGA) marks the beginning of the embryonic program for a totipotent embryo, which further gives rise to the pluripotent embryonic lineages and extraembryonic trophectoderm after the first lineage commitment. While much has been learned about pluripotency regulation, how ZGA is connected to the pluripotency commitment in early embryos remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of nuclear receptor 1 family transcription factors (TFs) in mouse pre-implantation embryos, whose motifs are highly enriched in accessible chromatin at the 2-cell (2C) to 8-cell (8C) stages after ZGA. We found NR5A2, an NR TF highly induced upon ZGA, is required for early development, as both the knockdown and knockout of Nr5a2 from 1C embryos led to morula arrest. While the zygotic genome was largely activated at the 2C stage, 4-8C-specific gene activation (mid-preimplantation activation) was substantially impaired. Genome-wide chromatin binding and RNA-seq analyses showed NR5A2 preferentially regulates its binding targets including a subset of key pluripotency genes (i.e., Nanog, Pou5f1, and Tdgf1). Finally, NR5A2-occupied sites at the 2C and 8C stages predominantly reside in accessible B1 elements where its motif is embedded. Taken together, these data identify NR5A2 as a key regulator that connects ZGA to the first lineage segregation in early mouse development.",

    "abstract": "To better understand the turning flight characteristics of the bees, we developed a procedure for estimating the instantaneous total force generated by the bee, along with its centrifugal force component, at each instant of time. We calculated the magnitude and direction of the total force vector (TFV) with respect to the three body axes of the bee and examined its variation with time during turning flights. The results of this study revealed that turns in the cloud are executed by (a) holding the magnitude of the TFV vector constant and (b) by redirecting the body (and therefore the turning force) appropriately to execute a coordinated turn. We also calculated and analysed the TFVs of bees flying in a curved tunnel. The characteristics of these TFVs (magnitude and direction) are very similar to those for bees flying in the cloud. This is a novel finding as there are no studies which have estimated the instantaneous flight force magnitude and direction of a turning bee (these are not saccadic or evasive turns) in an outdoor or indoor setup. However, similar results have been reported for pigeons and cockatiels while executing smooth turns in the horizontal plane.",

However, there is a lack of optimized sample preparation methods to achieve in-depth protein coverage for sperm cells. Meanwhile, it is not clear whether antibiotics can regulate proteins to affect sperm quality. Here, we systematically compared a total of six different protein extraction methods based the combination of three commonly used lysis buffers and physical lysis strategies. The urea buffer combined with ultrasonication (UA_ultrasonication) produced the highest protein extraction rate, leading to the deepest coverage of human sperm proteome (5685 protein groups) from healthy human sperm samples. Since the antibiotics, amoxicillin and clarithromycin, have been widely used against H. pylori infection, we conduct a longitudinal study of sperm proteome via data-independent acquisition tandem mass spectrometry (DIA-MS/MS) on an infected patient during on and off therapy with these two drugs. The semen examination and morphological analysis were performed combined with proteomics analysis. Our results indicated that antibiotics may cause an increase in the sperm concentration and the rate of malformed sperm and disrupt proteome expression in sperm. This work provides an optimized extraction method to characterize the in-depth human sperm proteome and to extend its clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "Cannabis sativa prenyltransferase 4 (CsPT4) and prenyltransferase 1 (CsPT1) have been shown to catalyze the step in the cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway that generates cannabigerolic acid (CBGA), the substrate for the end-point enzymes that generate cannabidiolic acid (CBDA) and tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA). Prior studies from our lab suggest that CBGA production rate-limits the pathway. There is a lack of understanding concerning how important cannabinoid biosynthetic genes are regulated as cannabinoid synthesis increases during female flower development. Both CsPT genes were shown to be highly expressed in flowers. The genes were also found to be present in leaves and roots. GUS staining also detected the promoter activities in leaves of seedlings, and the promoter activities were drastically stronger in the section of the sugar leaves where glandular trichomes are formed. In silico analysis of the two CsPT genes revealed several hormone and transcription factor responsive elements. Dual luciferase assays were conducted to determine whether a hormone could alter the promoter activities of CsPT1 and CsPT4. The results showed that CsPT4 pro was activated following treatment from salicylic acid (SA), gibberellic acid (GA), ethylene, ABA, and cytokinin, while the CsPT1 promoter was activated following SA, ethylene, ABA, and auxin treatment. In parallel studies, a correlation was observed between multiple cannabinoid biosynthetic pathway genes and SA application to the cannabis growing medium, along with a correlation between MeSA floral application and an increase in cannabinoid content. The results from all aspects of this study demonstrated an interaction between certain hormones and cannabinoid synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) are indispensable in anti-tumor immunity. Although CTLs are prone to exhaustion in patients with advanced cancer, T cell resiliency explains the presence of tumor-reactive CTLs that are less exhausted, capable of cytolytic function, expansion, and rebound in response to immunotherapy to reject metastatic malignances. However, the features of resilient T cells have not been clearly defined. In this report, we demonstrate that peripheral CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cells with low mitochondrial membrane potential rebounded CTL function quickly after radiation therapy in patients with large tumor burden portraying their functional resiliency. Furthermore, CX3CR1+ CD8+ T cell with low, but not high, mitochondrial membrane potential are highly cytotoxic, accumulate less reactive oxygen species (ROS), and express more Malic enzyme 1 (ME1). ME1 overexpression increases ATP production in a glycolysisindependent manner while concurrently curtailing excessive ROS in activated CD8+ T cells; and expands CX3CR1+NKG7+ effector CD8+ T cells with enhanced cytotoxicity. Importantly, transfection of ME1 mRNA promotes tumoricidal activity in CD8+ T cells from patients with advanced cancers. Our study reveals a mechanism used by CTLs to balance excessive ROS via ME1 to maintain a metabolic and functional resiliency. Modification of ME1 expression in CTLs may be a novel method to improve the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy by preventing T cell exhaustion.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=191 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/517988v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (64K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12e0f36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e8d412org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1baf57eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b2b43_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LICX3CR1+ and low Dy m identify functional resilient CD8+ T cells.\nC_LIO_LIResilient CD8+ T cells are highly cytotoxic and have less ROS.\nC_LIO_LIResilient CD8+ T cells express more ME1 that can balance extra ROS.\nC_LIO_LIME1 overexpression can promote CTL function of CD8+ T cells.\nC_LI",

Because of the emergence of multidrug-resistant V. parahaemolyticus strains, bacteriophages are considered promising agents for their biocontrol as an alternative or supplement to antibiotics. Here, a lytic vibriophage, vB_VpaM_R16F (R16F), was isolated from sewage from a seafood market by infecting V. parahaemolyticus 1.1997T. R16F was found to infect V. parahaemolyticus, but not nine other Vibrio spp. The phage belongs to the myovirus morphotype and lysed host cells with a short latent period (<10 min) and a small burst size (13 plaque-forming units). R16F has a linear double-stranded DNA with genome size 139,011 bp and a G+C content of 35.21%. Phylogenetic and intergenomic nucleotide sequence similarity analysis revealed that R16F is distinct from currently known vibriophages and belongs to a novel genus. Several genes (e.g., encoding ultraviolet damage endonuclease and endolysin) that may enhance environmental competitiveness were found in the genome of R16F, while no antibiotic resistance- or virulence factor-related gene was detected. In consideration of its biological and genetic properties, R16F is suggested to be a candidate biocontrol agent for use against V. parahaemolyticus.",

    "abstract": "Probiotic Lactobacillus strains had been investigated for the potential to protect against infection caused by the major fungal pathogen of human, Candida albicans. Besides antifungal activity, lactobacilli demonstrated a promising inhibitory effect on biofilm formation and filamentation of C. albicans. On the other hand, two commonly isolated non-albicans Candida species, C. tropicalis and C. parapsilosis, have similar characteristics in filamentation and biofilm formation with C. albicans. However, there is scant information of the effect of lactobacilli on the two species. In this study, biofilm inhibitory effects of L. rhamnosus ATCC 53103, L. plantarum ATCC 8014, and L. acidophilus ATCC 4356 were tested on the reference strain C. albicans SC5314 and six bloodstream isolated clinical strains, two each of C. albicans, C. tropicalis, and C. parapsilosis. Cell-free culture supernatants (CFSs) of L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum significantly inhibited in vitro biofilm growth of C. albicans and C. tropicalis. L. acidophilus, conversely, had little effect on C. albicans and C. tropicalis but was more effective on inhibiting C. parapsilosis biofilms. Neutralized L. rhamnosus CFS at pH 7 retained the inhibitory effect, suggesting that exometabolites other than lactic acid produced by the Lactobacillus strain might be accounted for the effect. Furthermore, we evaluated the inhibitory effects of L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum CFSs on the filamentation of C. albicans and C. tropicalis strains. Significantly less Candida filaments were observed after co-incubating with CFSs under hyphae-inducing conditions. Expressions of six biofilm-related genes (ALS1, ALS3, BCR1, EFG1, TEC1, and UME6 in C. albicans and corresponding orthologs in C. tropicalis) in biofilms co-incubated with CFSs were analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. When compared to untreated control, the expressions of ALS1, ALS3, EFG1, and TEC1 genes were downregulated in C. albicans biofilm. In C. tropicalis biofilms, ALS3 and UME6 were downregulated while TEC1 was upregulated. Taken together, the L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum strains demonstrated an inhibitory effect, which is likely mediated by the metabolites secreted into culture medium, on filamentation and biofilm formation of C. albicans and C. tropicalis. Our finding suggested an alternative to antifungals for controlling Candida biofilm.",

Understanding the transcriptional landscape long after irradiation treatment that results in chronic salivary hypofunction will help identify injury mechanisms and develop regenerative therapies to address this need. Advances in single cell (sc)RNAseq have made it possible to identify previously uncharacterized cell types within tissues and to uncover gene regulatory networks that mediate cell-cell communication and drive specific cell states. scRNAseq studies have been performed for virtually all major tissues including salivary glands; however, there are currently no scRNAseq studies evaluating the long-term chronic effects of irradiation on salivary glands. Here, we present scRNAseq from control and irradiated murine parotid glands collected 10 months post-irradiation. We identify a population of epithelial cells in the gland defined by expression of Etv1, which may be an acinar cell precursor. These Etv1+ cells also express Ntrk2 and Erbb3 and thus may respond to myoepithelial cell-derived growth factor ligands. Furthermore, our data suggests that CD4+CD8+ T-cells and secretory cells are the most transcriptionally affected during chronic injury with radiation, suggesting active immune involvement during chronic injury post-irradiation. Thus, our study provides a resource to understand the transcriptional landscape in a chronic post-irradiation microenvironment and identifies cell-specific pathways that may be targeted to repair chronic damage.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe generated a scRNAseq dataset of chronic irradiation injury in parotid glands\nC_LIO_LIA newly identified Etv1+ epithelial population may be acinar precursors\nC_LIO_LINtrk2 and Erbb3 are highly specific Etv1+ cell receptors that may mediate cell-cell communication with myoepithelial cells\nC_LIO_LICD8+ T-cells and secretory acinar cells have the greatest transcriptional changes post-IR\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "We employed NMR spectroscopy to investigate the structure and dynamics of the class B J domain protein (JDP) of S. cerevisiae (Sis1) complexed with an EEVD peptide of HSP70. It is widely recognized that the interactions between the EEVD motif and Sis1 play a crucial role in the chaperone activity. Notably, the deletion of the EEVD impairs the ability of Sis1 to bind with HSP70, while leaving the interaction between the class A JDP Ydj1 and HSP70 unaffected. Leveraging the advantages of NMR, which is particularly suitable for studying transient interactions, we provide compelling evidence that the EEVD motif transiently engages multiple sites on Sis1. Our findings revealed that EEVD binds to two distinct sites within the C-terminal domain I (CTDI) of Sis1. The interaction at these sites plays a crucial role in anchoring HSP70 to Sis1 at site I, as well as displacing the client protein at site II. Notably, site II is also the binding site for the client protein, and its displacement occurs through competition with the binding to site II. In addition to these interactions, we observed that EEVD, as a transient electrostatic binder, also interacts with the J domain and the GF-rich loop located between the J domain and -helix 6. We propose that the interaction between EEVD and Sis1 facilitates the dissociation of -helix 6, promoting a conformational state that is more favorable for interaction with HSP70 at the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and substrate-binding domain (SBD) interface. We also employed -synuclein as a substrate to investigate the competitive nature between EEVD and the client protein. Our experimental findings provided evidence supporting the interaction of EEVD with the client protein at multiple sites. Our findings contribute essential insights into the mechanistic cycle of class B JDPs, paving the way toward a more complete understanding of the primary function of Sis1, which is the transfer of the client protein to HSP70, where multiple site transient interactions play a collective role.",

    "abstract": "Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disease that causes arteriovenous vascular malformations (AVMs) in different organs, including the lung. Three genes, ENG (endoglin), ACVRL1 (ALK1) and SMAD4, all members of the TGF-{beta}/BMPR2 signaling pathway, are responsible for over 85% of all HHT cases. However, how these loss-of-function gene mutations lead to AVMs formation and what common downstream signaling they target is unknown. Here, using a combination of siRNA-mediated gene silencing, whole transcriptomic RNA sequencing, bioinformatic analysis, transcriptomic-based drug discovery, endothelial cells functional assays and VEGF signaling analysis, and ex vivo precision cut lung slice (PCLS) cultures approach, we uncovered common downstream transcriptomic gene signatures of HHT-casing genes and identified promising drug for HHT. We found the commonly used BMPR2-signaling downstream target ID1 is not a common downstream target of all the three HHT genes knockdown in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs). We identified novel common downstream targets of all the three HHT-causing genes that were enriched for HHT-related biological process and signaling pathways. Among those downstream genes, LYVE1, GPNMB, and MC5R were strong downstream targets that could serve as a better common downstream target than ID1. Furthermore, using the common downstream upregulated genes (HHT disease signature) following HHT gene knockdown, we identified a small molecule drug, Brivanib, that reversed the HHT disease signature, and inhibited VEGF-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, proliferation, and angiogenesis in PMVECs and inhibited some of the upregulated HHT disease genes in PCLS. Our findings suggest that Brivanib could be an emerging new drug for HHT.",

    "abstract": "The GTPase Rab14 is localized at the trans-Golgi network and at the intermediate compartment associated to sorting/recycling endosomes-like structures of the transferrin-recycling pathway: as other Rab family members, it is involved in the regulation of intracellular vesicle trafficking, though its role and functional relationship with effector/endosomal proteins is still incomplete.\n\nWe have analysed whether post-translational modifications could affect Rab14 activity: the results obtained define mono-ADP-ribosylation (MARylation) as the yet-unknown Rab14 modification, catalysed by the ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP12, which specifically modifies glutamic acid residues in position 159/162. This modification is essential for the Rab14-dependent endosome progression. Accordingly, recycling of the transferrin receptor is inhibited when MARylation of Rab14 is prevented by PARP12 knocking-down or inhibition, or by overexpression of Rab14 ADP-ribosylation-defective mutant. Under these conditions, Rab14 and transferrin receptors are withheld at the cell periphery at the level of the Rab4-RUFY1-positive sorting endosomes, indicating that the interaction of Rab14 with the dual effectors RUFY and then FIP1c (which specifically binds both Rab11 and Rab14) determines the progression between the Rab4-RUFY- and Rab11-FIP1c-specific vesicles. Therefore Rab14-MARylation determines the sequential binding of this GTPase to RUFY and FIP1c, thus controlling endosome progression (i.e., transferrin receptors recycling) through the Rab4-, Rab14- and Rab11-specific vesicles. This identifies a Rab14-specific compartment of the recycling pathway and a crucial enzymatic reaction amenable to pharmacological control.",

    "abstract": "At each cell division, nanometer-scale components self-organize to build a micron-scale spindle. In mammalian spindles, microtubule bundles called kinetochore-fibers attach to chromosomes and focus into spindle poles. Despite evidence suggesting that poles can set spindle length, their role remains poorly understood. In fact, many species do not have spindle poles. Here, we probe the poles contribution to mammalian spindle length, dynamics, and function by inhibiting dynein to generate spindles whose kinetochore-fibers do not focus into poles, yet maintain a metaphase steady-state length. We find that unfocused kinetochore-fibers have a mean length indistinguishable from control, but a broader length distribution, and reduced length coordination between sisters and neighbors. Further, we show that unfocused kinetochore-fibers, like control, can grow back to their steady-state length if acutely shortened by drug treatment or laser ablation: they recover their length by tuning their end dynamics, albeit slower due to their reduced baseline dynamics. Thus, kinetochore-fiber dynamics are regulated by their length, not just pole-focusing forces. Finally, we show that spindles with unfocused kinetochore-fibers can segregate chromosomes but fail to correctly do so. We propose that mammalian spindle length emerges locally from individual k-fibers while spindle poles globally coordinate k-fibers across space and time.",

    "abstract": "Treatment of parasitic nematode infections in humans and livestock relies on a small arsenal of anthelmintic drugs that have historically reduced parasite burdens. However, anthelmintic resistance (AR) is increasing, and little is known about the molecular and genetic causes of resistance for most drugs. The free-living roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans has proven to be a tractable model to understand AR, where studies have led to the identification of molecular targets of all major anthelmintic drug classes. Here, we used genetically diverse C. elegans strains to perform dose-response analyses across 26 anthelmintic drugs that represent the three major anthelmintic drug classes (benzimidazoles, macrocyclic lactones, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists) in addition to seven other anthelmintic classes. First, we found that C. elegans strains displayed significant variation in anthelmintic responses across drug classes. Dose-response trends within a drug class showed that the C. elegans strains elicited similar responses within the benzimidazoles but variable responses in the macrocyclic lactones and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists. Next, we compared the effective concentration estimates to induce a 10% maximal response (EC10) and slope estimates of each dose-response curve of each strain to the reference strain, N2, which enabled the identification of anthelmintics with population-wide differences to understand how genetics contribute to AR. Because genetically diverse strains displayed differential susceptibilities within and across anthelmintics, we show that C. elegans is a useful model for screening potential nematicides. Third, we quantified the heritability of responses to each anthelmintic and observed a significant correlation between exposure closest to the EC10 and the exposure that exhibited the most heritable responses. Heritable genetic variation can be explained by strain-specific anthelmintic responses within and across drug classes. These results suggest drugs to prioritize in genome-wide association studies, which will enable the identification of AR genes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYParasitic nematodes infect most animal species and significantly impact human and animal health. Control of parasitic nematodes in host species relies on a limited collection of anthelmintic drugs. However, anthelmintic resistance is widespread, which threatens our ability to control parasitic nematode populations. Here, we used the non-parasitic roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans as a model to study anthelmintic resistance across 26 anthelmintics that span ten drug classes. We leveraged the genetic diversity of C. elegans to quantify anthelmintic responses across a range of doses, estimate dose-response curves, fit strain-specific model parameters, and calculate the contributions of genetics to these parameters. We found that genetic variation within a species plays a considerable role in anthelmintic responses within and across drug classes. Our results emphasize how the incorporation of genetically diverse C. elegans strains is necessary to understand anthelmintic response variation found in natural populations. These results highlight drugs to prioritize in future mapping studies to identify genes involved in anthelmintic resistance.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=125 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518036v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6222bborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d635a6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c3935org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1afe3fe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The human SASS6(I62T) missense mutation has been linked with the incidence of primary microcephaly in a Pakistani family, although the mechanisms by which this mutation causes disease remain unclear. The SASS6(I62T) mutation corresponds to SAS-6(L69T) in C. elegans. Given that SAS-6 is highly conserved, we modeled this mutation in C. elegans and examined sas-6(L69T) effect on centrosome duplication, ciliogenesis and dendrite morphogenesis. Our studies revealed that all the above processes are perturbed by the sas-6(L69T) mutation. Specifically, C. elegans carrying the sas-6(L69T) mutation exhibit an increased failure of centrosome duplication in a sensitized genetic background. Further, worms carrying this mutation also display shortened phasmid cilia, an abnormal phasmid cilia morphology, shorter phasmid dendrites and chemotaxis defects. Our data show that the centrosome duplication defects caused by this mutation are only uncovered in a sensitized genetic background, indicating that these defects are mild. However, the ciliogenesis and dendritic defects caused by this mutation are evident in an otherwise wild-type background, indicating that they are stronger defects. Thus, our studies shed light on the novel mechanisms by which the sas-6(L69T) mutation could contribute to the incidence of primary microcephaly in humans.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers play a critical role in development by precisely modulating spatial, temporal, and cell type-specific gene expression. Sequence variants in enhancers have been implicated in disease, however establishing the functional consequences of these variants is challenging due to a lack of understanding of precise cell types and developmental stages where the enhancers are normally active. PAX6 is the master regulator of eye development, and has a regulatory landscape containing multiple enhancers driving expression in the eye. Whether these enhancers perform additive, redundant, or distinct functions is unknown. Here we describe the precise cell types and regulatory activity of two PAX6 retinal enhancers, HS5 and NRE. Using a unique combination of live imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing in dual enhancer-reporter zebrafish embryos, we find significant differences in the spatiotemporal activity of these enhancers, and show that HS5 and NRE are active in distinct cell types of the developing retina. Our results show that although overlapping, these enhancers have distinct activities in different cell types and therefore likely non-redundant functions. This work demonstrates that unique cell type-specific functions can be uncovered for apparently similar enhancers when investigated at high resolution in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Prions represent epigenetic regulator proteins that can self-propagate their structure and confer their misfolded structure and function on normally folded proteins. Like the mammalian prion PrPSc, prions also occur in fungi. While a few prions, like Swi1, affect gene expression, none are shown to affect heterochromatin structure and function. In fission yeast and metazoans, histone methyltransferase Clr4/Suv39 causes H3-Lys9 methylation, which is bound by the chromodomain protein Swi6/HP1 to assemble heterochromatin. Earlier, we showed that sng2-1 mutation in the Cut4 subunit of Anaphase Promoting Complex abrogates heterochromatin structure due to defective binding and recruitment of Swi6. Here, we demonstrate that the Cut4p forms a non-canonical prion form, designated as [SNG2], which abrogates heterochromatin silencing. [SNG2] exhibits various prion-like properties, e.g., non-Mendelian inheritance, requirement of Hsp proteins for its propagation, de novo generation upon cut4 overexpression, reversible curing by guanidine, cytoplasmic inheritance and formation of infectious protein aggregates, which are converted into monomers upon overexpression of hsp genes. Interestingly, [SNG2] prion imparts an enhanced tolerance to stress conditions, supporting its role in promoting cell survival under environmental stress during evolution.",

Analyses of experimental data from two-dimensional epithelial monolayers in combination with agent-based simulations show that cell division and apoptosis lead to directed cell motion for hours, resulting in rapid topological transitions in neighboring cells. These transitions in turn generate both long ranged and long lived clockwise and anticlockwise vortices, which gives rise to turbulent-like flows. Both experiments and simulations show that at long wavelengths the wave vector (k) dependent energy spectrum E(k) {approx} k-5/3, coinciding with the Kolmogorov scaling in fully developed inertial turbulence. Using theoretical arguments and simulations, we show that long-lived vortices lead to long-time tails in the velocity auto-correlation function, Cv(t) [~] t-1/2, which has the same structure as in classical 2D fluids but with a different scaling exponent.",

To directly assess the extent to which environmental microbes induce variation in host life history traits and behavior, we inoculated axenic Drosophila with microbes isolated from two different field sites and generated two populations with distinct bacterial and fungal profiles. We show that microbes isolated from environmental sites with modest abiotic differences induce large variation in host reproduction, fatty acid levels, stress tolerance, and sleep behavior.

    "abstract": "In general, control of movement is considered to be either cortical, spinal, or purely biomechanical and is studied separately at these levels. To achieve this separation when studying a particular level, variations that may be introduced by the other levels are generally either ignored or restricted. This restriction misrepresents the way movements occur in realistic scenarios and limits the ability to model movements in a biologically inspired manner. In this work, we propose a heuristic model for motor control that conceptually and mathematically accounts for the entire motor process, from target to endpoint. It simulates human arm motion and is able to represent functionally different motion properties by flexibly choosing more or less complex motion paths without built-in optimization or joint constraints. With a novel implementation of hierarchical control, this model successfully overcomes the problem of degrees of freedom in robotics. It can serve as a template for neurocomputational work that currently uses control architectures that do not mirror the human motor control process. The model itself also suggests a maximum threshold for delays in position feedback for effective movement, and that the primary role of position feedback in movement is to overcome the effects of environmental perturbations at the joint level. These findings can inform future efforts to develop biologically inspired motor control techniques for prosthetic devices.",

    "abstract": "Cerebral malaria (CM) lethality is attributable to brain edema induction but the cellular mechanisms involving brain microvascular endothelium in CM pathogenesis are unexplored. Activation of the STING-INFb-CXCL10 axis in brain endothelial cells (BECs) is a prominent component of the innate immune response in cerebral malaria (CM) development in mouse models. Using a T cell-reporter system, we show that Type I IFN signaling in BECs exposed to Plasmodium berghei-infected erythrocytes (PbA-IE), functionally enhances MHC Class-I antigen presentation through gamma-interferon independent immunoproteasome activation and impacted the proteome functionally related to vesicle trafficking, protein processing, and folding and antigen presentation. In vitro assays show that Type I IFN signaling and immunoproteasome activation are also involved in the dysfunction of the endothelial barrier through disturbing gene expression in the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway. We demonstrate that IE exposure induces a substantial increase in BECs glucose uptake while glycolysis blockade abrogates INFb secretion impairing immunoproteasome activation, antigen presentation, and Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling. Metabolome analysis show that energy demand and production are markedly increased in BECs exposed to IE as revealed by enriched content in glucose and amino acid catabolites. In accordance, glycolysis blockade in vivo delayed the clinical onset of CM in mice. Our results unveiled that Type I IFN signaling and subsequent immunoproteasome activation in BECs contribute to enhanced antigen presentation and the impairment of the endothelial barrier function. We also show that Type I IFN signaling and its downstream effects are licensed by dramatic increase in glucose uptake impacting on energy metabolism pathways. This work substantiates the hypothesis that Type I IFN-immunoproteasome induction response in BECs contributes to CM pathology and fatality (1) by increasing antigen presentation to cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and (2) by promoting endothelial barrier dysfunction, favoring brain vasogenic edema.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518027v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@859960org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1186de4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d6b625org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@50751d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG AUTHOR SUMMARYCerebral malaria is a severe clinical form of malaria infection that leads to respiratory arrest and death due to brain swelling. Disruption of blood vessels in the brain barrier is a hallmark of cerebral malaria development. However, the underlying pathological mechanisms are still unsettled. We explored the hypothesis that immune response of brain blood vessels to malaria infection is an initiator of inflammatory events leading to cerebral malaria. Our experiments unveiled that proinflammatory Type I interferon action increases the presentation of parasite molecules by brain blood vessel cells to cytotoxic immune cells and promotes brain vessel disruption. We found that these effects are determined by activation of protein degradation systems upon exposure of brain blood vessel cells to malaria parasite-infected erythrocytes. Our findings unveil a critical role of Type I interferon in brain blood vessels cells signaling in initiating immunopathology mechanisms associated to cerebral malaria development and suggest that blocking Type I interferon induction in the brain provides a path to prevent this disease.",

Here, we characterize a TA system in Legionella pneumophila that is highly conserved across Legionella species. This system is distantly related to Escherichia coli HipBST and we demonstrate that it is a functional tripartite TA system (denoted HipBSTLp). We identify HipBSTLp homologs in diverse taxa, yet in the Gammaproteobacteria these are almost exclusively found in Legionella species. Notably, the toxin HipTLp was previously reported to be a pathogenic effector protein that is translocated by L. pneumophila into its eukaryotic hosts. Contrary to this, we find no signal of HipTLp translocation beyond untranslocated control levels and make several observations consistent with a canonical role as a bacterial toxin. We present structural and biochemical insights into the regulation and neutralization of HipBSTLp, and identify key variations between this system and HipBSTEc. Finally, we show that the target of HipTLp is likely not conserved with any characterized HipA or HipT toxin. This work serves as a unique comparison of a TA system across bacterial species and illustrates the molecular diversity that exists within a single TA family.",

    "abstract": "RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often engage multiple RNA binding domains (RBDs) to increase target specificity and affinity. However, the complexity of target recognition of multiple RBDs remains largely unexplored. Here we use Upstream of N-Ras (Unr), a multidomain RBP, to demonstrate how multiple RBDs orchestrate target specificity. A crystal structure of the three C-terminal RNA binding cold-shock domains (CSD) of Unr bound to a poly(A) sequence exemplifies how recognition goes beyond the classical {pi}-{pi}-stacking in CSDs. Further structural studies reveal several interaction surfaces between the N-terminal and C-terminal part of Unr with the poly(A)-binding protein (pAbp). This provides first atomistic details towards understanding regulation of translation initiation that is mediated by the interplay of these two proteins with each other and RNA.",

    "abstract": "Tooth development starts with formation of the dental lamina, a localized thickening of the maxillary and mandibular epithelium, at specific location of oral cavity. How this dental lamina is specified within the continuous naive maxillary and mandibular epithelium, remains as a critical and unresolved question. To identify potential genes and transcriptional regulatory networks that controlling dental lamina formation, we utilized single-cell Multiome-seq and Laser Microdissection coupled RNA-seq to profile gene expression and open chromatin of mandibular epithelium during tooth initiation. We comprehensively identified transcription factors (TFs) and signaling pathways that are differentially expressed among different domains (including dental lamina) along dorsal-ventral axis of mandibular epithelium. Specifically, we found Sox2 and Tfap2a/Tfap2b forming two complementary domains along the dorsal-ventral axis of mandibular epithelium. Furthermore, dental lamina specific or enriched TFs such as Pitx1, Pitx2 and Zfp536 are presented around the interface of Sox2 and Tfap2a/Tfap2b. We also identified correlation between signaling pathways and domain specific TFs. Through computational analysis of single-cell Multiome-seq dataset, we identified potential key/driver TFs and core transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs) for lineages (oral, dental, skin) specification during tooth initiation. Our computational analysis also reveals a potential cross repression interactions between different groups of TFs (i.e. Pitx1/Pitx2 and Tfap2a/Tfap2b) that might be essential for dental lamina specification.",

    "abstract": "In animals with internal fertilization, males transfer gametes and seminal fluid during copulation, both of which are required for successful reproduction. In Drosophila and other insects, seminal fluid is produced in the paired accessory gland (AG), the ejaculatory duct, and the ejaculatory bulb. The D. melanogaster AG has emerged as an important model system for this component of male reproductive biology. Seminal fluid proteins produced in the Drosophila AG are required for proper storage and use of sperm by the females, and are also critical for establishing and maintaining a suite of short- and long-term postcopulatory female physiological responses that promote reproductive success. The Drosophila AG is composed of two main cell types. The majority of AG cells, which are referred to as main cells, are responsible for production of many seminal fluid proteins. A minority of cells, about 4%, are referred to as secondary cells. These cells, which are restricted to the distal tip of the D. melanogaster AG, may play an especially important role in the maintenance of the long-term female post-mating response. Many studies of Drosophila AG evolution have suggested that the proteins produced in the gland evolve quickly, as does the transcriptome. Here, we investigate the evolution of secondary cell number and position in the AG in a collection of eight species spanning the entire history of the Drosophila genus. We document a heretofore underappreciated rapid evolutionary rate for both number and position of these specialized AG cells, raising many interesting questions about the developmental, functional, and evolutionary significance of this variation.",

    "abstract": "Facultative heterochromatin controls development and differentiation in many eukaryotes. In metazoans, plants, and many filamentous fungi, facultative heterochromatin is characterized by transcriptional repression and enrichment with nucleosomes that are trimethylated at histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). While loss of H3K27me3 results in derepression of transcriptional gene silencing in many species, additional up- and downstream layers of regulation are necessary to mediate control of transcription in chromosome regions enriched with H3K27me3. Here, we investigated the effects of one histone mark on histone H4, namely H4K20me3, in the fungus Zymoseptoria tritici, a globally important pathogen of wheat. Deletion of kmt5, the gene encoding the sole methyltransferase responsible for H4K20 methylation, resulted in global derepression of transcription, especially in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Reversal of silencing in the absence of H4K20me3 not only affected genes but also a large number of novel, previously undetected, non-coding transcripts generated from regions of facultative heterochromatin on accessory chromosomes. Transcriptional activation in kmt5 deletion strains was accompanied by a complete loss of Ash1-mediated H3K36me3 and chromatin reorganization affecting H3K27me3 and H3K4me2 distribution in regions of facultative heterochromatin. Strains with a H4K20M mutation in the single histone H4 gene of Z. tritici recapitulated these chromatin changes, suggesting that H4K20me3 is essential for Ash1-mediated H3K36me3. The {Delta}kmt5 mutants we obtained are more sensitive to genotoxic stressors and both, {Delta}kmt5 and {Delta}ash1, showed greatly increased rates of accessory chromosome loss. Taken together, our results provide insights into a novel, and unsuspected, mechanism controlling the assembly and maintenance of facultative heterochromatin.\n\nSignificanceFacultative heterochromatin contains genes important for specific developmental or life cycle stages. Transcriptional regulation of these genes is influenced by chromatin structure. Here, we report that a little studied histone modification, trimethylation of lysine 20 on histone H4 (H4K20me3), is enriched in facultative heterochromatin and important for transcriptional repression in these regions in an important agricultural pathogen. Furthermore, normal levels of H4K20me3 are essential for deposition of another repressive histone mark, Ash1-mediated H3K36me3, and affect the distribution of other marks including H3K27me3. We conducted the first genome-wide assessment of H4K20 methylation levels in a fungus, and our discoveries reveal that multiple chromatin modifications are required to establish transcriptional silencing, providing the framework to understand epistasis relationships among these histone marks.",

    "abstract": "A key and unresolved question in aging research is how to quantify aging at the individual level that led to development of \"aging clocks\", machine learning algorhythms trained to predict individual age from high-dimensional molecular data under the the assumption that individual deviations of the predicted age from the chronological age contain information on the individual condition (often referred to as \"biological age\"). A full validation of such clocks as biomarkers for clinical studies of ageing would require a comparison of their predictions with information on actual lifespan and long-term health. Such studies take decades in humans, but could be conducted in a much shorter time-frame in animal models. We developed a transcriptomic clock in the turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri. This species is the shortest-lived vertebrate that can be cultured in captivity and is an emerging model organism for genetic and experimental studies on aging. We developed a proprietary deep learning architecture that autonomously selects a customizable number of input genes to use for its predictions in order to reduce overfitting and increase interpretability, and adopts an adversarial learning framework to identify tissue-independent transcriptional patterns. We called this architecture the Selective Adversarial Deep Neural Network (SA-DNN) and trained it on a multi-tissue transcriptomic dataset of N. furzeri. This SA-DNN predicted age of the test set with an accuracy of 1 day, i.e. less than 1% of the total species lifespan and detected genetic, pharmacological and environmental interventions that are known to influence lifespan in this species. Finally, a human transcriptomic multi-tissue clock that uses as input the orthologs of the genes selected by our SA-DNN in N. furzeri reaches an average error of[~] 3 years rivalling epigenetic clocks. Our SA-DNN represents the prototype of a new class of aging clocks that provide biomarkers applicable to intervention studies in model organisms and humans.",

    "abstract": "Centromeres are chromosomal regions essential for coordinating chromosome segregation during cell division. While centromeres are defined by the presence of a centromere-specific histone H3 variant rather than a particular DNA sequence, they are typically embedded in repeat-dense chromosomal genome regions. In many species, centromeres are associated with transposable elements, but it is unclear if these elements are selfish or if they play a role in centromere specification or function. Here we use Drosophila melanogaster as a model to understand the evolution of centromere-associated transposable elements. G2/Jockey-3 is a non-LTR retroelement in the Jockey clade and the only sequence shared by all centromeres. We study the evolution of G2/Jockey-3 using short and long read population genomic data to infer insertion polymorphisms across the genome. We combine estimates of the age, frequency, and location of insertions to infer the evolutionary processes shaping G2/Jockey-3 and its association with the centromeres. We find that G2/Jockey-3 is an active retroelement targeted by the piRNA pathway that is enriched in centromeres at least in part due to an insertion bias. We do not detect signatures of positive selection on any G2/Jockey-3 insertions that would suggest than individual copies are favored by natural selection. Instead, we infer that most insertions are neutral or weakly deleterious both inside and outside of the centromeres. Therefore, G2/Jockey-3 evolution is consistent with it being a selfish genetic element that targets centromeres. We propose that targeting centromeres helps active retroelements escape host defenses, as the unique centromeric chromatin may prevent targeting by the host silencing machinery. At the same time, centromeric TEs insertions may be tolerated or even beneficial if they also contribute to the transcriptional and chromatin environment. Thus, we suspect centromere-associated retroelements like G2/Jockey-3 reflect a balance between conflict and cooperation at the centromeres.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Asian bush mosquito Aedes japonicus is rapidly invading North America and Europe. Due to its potential to transmit multiple pathogenic arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses including Zika virus, West Nile virus and chikungunya virus, it is important to understand the biology of this vector mosquito in more detail. In addition to arboviruses, mosquitoes can also carry insect-specific viruses that receive increasing attention due to their potential effects on host physiology and arbovirus transmission. In this study, we characterized the collection of viruses, referred to as the virome, circulating in Ae. japonicus populations in the Netherlands and France.\n\nResultsApplying a small RNA-based metagenomic approach to Ae. japonicus, we uncovered a distinct group of viruses present in samples from both the Netherlands and France. These included one known virus, Ae. japonicus narnavirus 1 (AejapNV1), and three new virus species that we named Ae. japonicus totivirus 1 (AejapTV1), Ae. japonicus anphevirus 1 (AejapAV1) and Ae. japonicus bunyavirus 1 (AejapBV1). We also discovered sequences that were presumably derived from two additional novel viruses: Ae. japonicus bunyavirus 2 (AejapBV2) and Ae. japonicus rhabdovirus 1 (AejapRV1). All six viruses induced strong RNA interference responses, including the production of 21 nucleotide sized small interfering RNAs, a signature of active replication in the host. Notably, AejapBV1 and AejapBV2 belong to different viral families, however, no RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence has been found for AejapBV2. Intriguingly, our small RNA-based approach identified a [~]1 kb long ambigrammatic RNA that is associated with AejapNV1 as a secondary segment but showed no similarity to any sequence in public databases. We confirmed the presence of AejapNV1 primary and secondary segments, AejapTV1, AejapAV1 and AejapBV1 by reverse-transcriptase PCR in wild-caught Ae. japonicus mosquitoes. AejapNV1 and AejapTV1 were found at high prevalence (87-100%) in adult females, adult males and larvae.\n\nConclusionsUsing a small RNA-based, sequence-independent metagenomic strategy, we uncovered a conserved and prevalent virome among Ae. japonicus mosquito populations. The high prevalence of AejapNV1 and AejapTV1 across all tested mosquito life stages suggests that these viruses are intimately associated with Ae. japonicus and may affect different aspects of the physiology of this vector mosquito.",
