    "abstract": "Many world fisheries display a declining mean trophic level of catches. This \"fishing down the food web\" is often attributed to reduced densities of high-trophic-level species. We show here that the fishing down pattern can actually emerge from the adaptive harvesting of two- and three-species food webs, where changes in fishing patterns are driven by the relative profitabilities of the harvested species. Shifting fishing patterns from a focus on higher trophic levels to a focus on lower trophic levels can yield abrupt changes in the system, strongly impacting species densities. In predator-prey systems, such regime shifts occur when the predator species is highly valuable relative to the prey, and when the top-down control on the prey is strong. Moreover, we find that when the two species are jointly harvested, high adaptation speeds can reduce the resilience of fisheries. Our results therefore suggest that flexibility in harvesting strategies will not necessarily benefit fisheries but may actually harm their sustainability.",

    "abstract": "In behavior analysis, the modulation of the effect of time-based schedules by the spatial characteristics of the environment has been scarcely studied. Furthermore, the spatial organization of behavior, despite its ubiquity and ecological relevance, has not been widely addressed. The purpose of the present work was to analyze the effect of water delivery location (peripheral vs. central) on the spatial organization of water-feeding behavior under time-based schedules. One group of rats was exposed to a Fixed Time 30 s-water-delivery schedule and a second group to a Variable Time 30 s schedule. For both groups, in the first phase, the water dispenser was located in the perimetral zone. In the second condition, the water dispenser was located in the central zone. Each location was presented for 20 sessions. Rats trajectories, distance to the dispenser, accumulated time in regions, and entropy measures were analyzed. A differential effect of the location of water delivery in interaction with the time-based schedule was observed on all the analyzed spatial qualities of behavior. The findings are discussed in relation to the ecological proposal of Timberlakes behavioral systems.",

    "abstract": "Potent T cell responses against infections and malignancies depend on the release of effector molecules, such as pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because effector molecules can be toxic, their production is tightly regulated through post-transcriptional events at 3 Untranslated Regions (3UTRs). RNA binding proteins (RBPs) were shown to be key regulators herein. With an RNA aptamer-based capture assay from human T cells, we identified >130 RBPs interacting with the IFNG, TNF and IL2 3UTRs in human T cells. T cell activation altered RBP-RNA interactions, revealing that RBP-target mRNA interactions rapidly respond to stimulation. Furthermore, we uncovered the intricate and time-dependent regulation of cytokine production by RBPs: whereas HuR supports early cytokine production, ZFP36L1, ATXN2L and ZC3HAV1 dampen and shorten the production duration, each at different time points. Strikingly, even though ZFP36L1 deletion did not phenotypically rescue T cell dysfunction in tumors, the increased production of cytokines and cytotoxic molecules resulted in superior anti-tumoral T cell responses in vivo. Our findings thus show that identifying RBP-RNA interactions reveals key modulators of T cell responses in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial exposure to antibiotic concentrations below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) may result in a selection window allowing for the rapid evolution of resistance. These sub-MIC concentrations are commonly found in the greater environment. This study aimed to evaluate the adaptive genetic changes in Klebsiella pneumoniae 43816 after prolonged but increasing sub-MIC levels of the common antibiotic cephalothin over a fourteen-day period. Over the course of the experiment, antibiotic concentrations increased from 0.5 g/mL to 7.5 g/mL. At the end of this extended exposure, the final adapted bacterial culture exhibited clinical resistance to both cephalothin and tetracycline, altered cellular and colony morphology, and a highly mucoid phenotype. Cephalothin resistance exceeded 125 g/mL without the acquisition of beta-lactamase genes. Whole genome sequencing identified a series of genetic changes that could be mapped over the fourteen-day exposure period to the onset of antibiotic resistance. Specifically, mutations in the rpoB subunit of RNA Polymerase, the tetR/acrR regulator, and the wcaJ sugar transferase each fix at specific timepoints in the exposure regimen where the MIC susceptibility dramatically increases. These mutations indicate that alterations in the secretion of colanic acid and attachment of colonic acid to LPS, may contribute to the resistant phenotype. These data demonstrate that very low, sub-MIC concentrations of antibiotics can have dramatic impacts on the bacterial evolution of resistance. Additionally, this study demonstrates that beta-lactam resistance can be achieved through sequential accumulation of specific mutations without the acquisition of a beta-lactamase gene.\n\nImportanceBacteria are constantly exposed to low levels of antibiotics in the environment. The impact of this low-level exposure on bacterial evolution is not well understood. In this work, we developed a model to expose Klebsiella pneumoniae to progressive, low doses of the antibiotic cephalothin. After a fourteen-day exposure regimen, our culture exhibited full clinical resistance to this antibiotic without the traditional acquisition of inactivating genes. This culture also exhibited resistance to tetracycline, had a highly mucoid appearance, and exhibited altered, elongated cellular morphology. Whole genome sequencing identified a collection of mutations to the bacterial genome that could be mapped to the emergence of the resistant phenotype. This study demonstrates that antibiotic resistance can be achieved in response to low level antibiotic exposure and without the traditional acquisition of resistance genes. Further, this study identifies new genes that may play a role in the evolution of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Like other insects, secretion by mosquito Malpighian tubules (MTs) is driven by the V-type H+-ATPase (VA) localized in the apical membrane of principal cells. The anti-diuretic neurohormone CAPA inhibits secretion by MTs stimulated by select diuretic hormones; however, the cellular effectors of this inhibitory signaling cascade remain unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that the VA inhibitor bafilomycin selectively inhibits serotonin (5HT)- and calcitonin-related diuretic hormone (DH31)-stimulated secretion. VA activity increases in DH31-treated MTs, whereas CAPA abolishes this increase through a NOS/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway. A critical feature of VA activation involves the reversible association of the cytosolic (V1) and membrane (Vo) complexes. Indeed, higher V1 protein abundance was found in membrane fractions of DH31-treated MTs whereas CAPA significantly decreased V1 abundance in membrane fractions while increasing it in cytosolic fractions. Immunolocalization of V1 was observed strictly in the apical membrane of MTs treated with DH31 alone whereas immunoreactivity was dispersed following CAPA treatment. VA complexes colocalized apically in female MTs shortly after a blood-meal consistent with the peak and post-peak phases of diuresis. Comparatively, V1 immunoreactivity in MTs was more dispersed and did not colocalize with the Vo complex in the apical membrane at 3 hours post blood-meal, representing a timepoint after the late phase of diuresis has concluded. Therefore, CAPA inhibition of MTs involves reducing VA activity and promotes complex dissociation hindering secretion. Collectively, these findings reveal a key target in hormone-mediated inhibition of MTs countering diuresis that provides a deeper understanding of this critical physiological process necessary for hydromineral balance.\n\nSignificance StatementThe V-type H+ ATPase (VA), also known as the proton pump, provides the driving force for transepithelial ion and fluid secretion in insect Malpighian tubules (MTs). While studies have shown that diuretic stimulation activates various signaling pathways promoting increased VA activity, our understanding of anti-diuretic signaling and its potential regulation of the VA remains rudimentary. Here we show that a CAPA neuropeptide acts through the NOS/cGMP/PKG pathway to inhibit VA activity, supporting the notion that the anti-diuretic regulation is achieved by promoting dissociation of the VA complexes. These results demonstrate a critical role of VA inhibition and trafficking necessary for anti-diuretic signaling and advances our understanding of the complex neuroendocrine control of the MTs in this important human disease-vector mosquito.",

We previously developed self-organizing culture for 3D-retina generation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). Here we present a quality control method and preclinical studies for tissue-sheet transplantation. Self-organizing hPSCs differentiated into both retinal and off-target tissues. Gene expression analyses identified the major off-target tissues as eye-related, cortex-like, and spinal cord-like tissues. For quality control, we developed a qPCR-based test in which each hPSC-derived neuroepithelium was dissected into two tissue-sheets: inner-central sheet for transplantation and outer-peripheral sheet for qPCR to ensure retinal tissue selection. During qPCR, tissue-sheets were stored for 3-4 days using a newly developed preservation method. In a rat tumorigenicity study, no transplant-related adverse events were observed. In retinal degeneration model rats, retinal transplants differentiated into mature photoreceptors and exhibited light responses in electrophysiology assays. These results demonstrate our rationale toward self-organizing retinal sheet transplantation therapy.",

    "abstract": "A long standing challenge in biological and artificial intelligence is to understand how new knowledge can be constructed from known building blocks in a way that is amenable for computation by neuronal circuits. Here we focus on the task of storage and recall of structured knowledge in long-term memory. Specifically, we ask how recurrent neuronal networks can store and retrieve multiple knowledge structures. We model each structure as a set of binary relations between events and attributes (attributes may represent e.g., temporal order, spatial location, role in semantic structure), and map each structure to a distributed neuronal activity pattern using a vector symbolic architecture (VSA) scheme.\n\nWe then use associative memory plasticity rules to store the binarized patterns as fixed points in a recurrent network. By a combination of signal-to-noise analysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our model allows for efficient storage of these knowledge structures, such that the memorized structures as well as their individual building blocks (e.g., events and attributes) can be subsequently retrieved from partial retrieving cues. We show that long-term memory of structured knowledge relies on a new principle of computation beyond the memory basins. Finally, we show that our model can be extended to store sequences of memories as single attractors.",

In this work, data on knowledge of evolutionary theory and supernatural and dualistic beliefs of 287 Argentinian students of psychology and medicine majors. were collected through a cross-sectional online survey. Information was analyzed to determine whether an association exists between knowledge of evolutionary theory, supernatural beliefs and dualism. We found significant statistical associations between supernatural beliefs and dualism (positive) and between both and knowledge of evolutionary theory (negative). Also, some heterogeneity was found within dualistic questions between theoretical ones and a hypothetical case. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that knowledge of evolutionary theory could challenge mind-body dualistic conceptions.",

    "abstract": "The locus coeruleus (LC), a small subcortical structure in the brainstem, is the brains principal source of norepinephrine. It plays a primary role in regulating stress, the sleep-wake cycle, and attention, and its degradation is associated with aging and neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive deficits (e.g., Parkinsons, Alzheimers). Yet precisely how norepinephrine drives brain networks to support healthy cognitive function remains poorly understood - partly because LCs small size makes it difficult to study noninvasively in humans. Here, we characterized LCs influence on brain dynamics using a hidden Markov model fitted to functional neuroimaging data from healthy young adults across four attention-related brain networks and LC. We modulated LC activity using a behavioral paradigm and measured individual differences in LC magnetization transfer contrast. The model revealed five hidden states, including a stable state dominated by salience-network activity that occurred when subjects actively engaged with the task. LC magnetization transfer contrast correlated with this states stability across experimental manipulations and with subjects propensity to enter into and remain in this state. These results provide new insight into LCs role in driving spatiotemporal neural patterns associated with attention, and demonstrate that variation in LC integrity can explain individual differences in these patterns even in healthy young adults.",

As observed by Turing in 1952, these patterns are in a state of continual development, and are usually transitioning from one pattern into another. How do cells robustly decode these spatio-temporal patterns into signals in the presence of confounding effects caused by unpredictable or heterogeneous environments? Here, we answer this question by developing a general theory of pattern formation in spatio-temporal variations of  pre-pattern morphogens, which determine gene-regulatory network parameters. Through mathematical analysis, we identify universal dynamical regimes that apply to wide classes of biological systems. We apply our theory to two paradigmatic pattern-forming systems, and predict that they are robust with respect to non-physiological morphogen variations. More broadly, our theoretical framework provides a general approach to classify the emergent dynamics of pattern-forming systems based on how the bifurcations in their governing equations are traversed.",

By introducing a new quantity termed metabolic flux intensity, defined as pathway flux divided by specific growth rate, we showed that metabolism is dually controlled by proliferation and oncogenotypes. 13C-MFA further revealed that oxidative pentose phosphate pathway (oxPPP), malate dehydrogenase (MDH) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) were most enhanced in cancerous HMECs.

    "abstract": "Microtubules (MTs) are built from -/{beta}-tubulin dimers and used as tracks by kinesin and dynein motors to transport a variety of cargos, such as mRNAs, proteins, and organelles, within the cell. Tubulins are subjected to several post-translational modifications (PTMs). Glutamylation is one of them, and it is responsible for adding one or more glutamic acid residues as branched peptide chains to the C-terminal tails of both - and {beta}-tubulin. However, very little is known about the specific modifications found on the different tubulin isotypes in vivo and the role of these PTMs in MT transport and other cellular processes in vivo. In this study, we found that in Drosophila ovaries, glutamylation of -tubulin isotypes occurred clearly on the C-terminal ends of Tub84B and Tub84D (Tub84B/D). In contrast, the ovarian -tubulin, Tub67C, is not glutamylated. The C-terminal ends of Tub84B/D are glutamylated at several glutamyl side chains in various combinations. Drosophila TTLL5 is required for the mono- and poly-glutamylation of ovarian Tub84B/D and with this for the proper localization of glutamylated microtubules. Similarly, proper Kinesin-1 distribution in the germline also depends on TTLL5 as well as the refining of Staufen localization and the normal fast ooplasmic streaming with its directional movement, two processes known to depend on Kinesin-1 activities. In the nervous system, the pausing of anterograde axonal transport of mitochondria is affected by an enzymatically dead mutant of TTLL5.

In Aplysia, nonassociative learning can be enhanced by a computationally designed learning protocol with intertrial intervals (ITIs) that maximize the interaction between fast-activated protein kinase A (PKA) and slow-activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Whether a similar strategy can enhance associative learning in mammals is unknown.\n\nMethodsWe simulated 1,000 training protocols with varying ITIs to predict an optimal protocol based on empirical data for PKA and ERK dynamics in rat hippocampus. Adult male rats received the optimal protocol or control protocols in auditory fear conditioning and fear extinction experiments. Immunohistochemistry was performed to evaluate phosphorylated cAMP responsive element binding (pCREB) protein levels in brain regions implicated in fear acquisition.\n\nResultsRats exposed to the optimal conditioning protocol with irregular ITIs exhibited impaired extinction memory acquisition within the session using a standard footshock intensity, and stronger fear memory retrieval and spontaneous recovery with a weaker footshock intensity, compared to rats that received massed or spaced conditioning protocols with fixed ITIs. Rats exposed to the optimal extinction protocol displayed improved extinction of contextual fear memory and reduced spontaneous recovery compared to rats that received standard extinction protocols. Moreover, the optimal conditioning protocol increased pCREB levels in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the dorsal hippocampus, suggesting enhanced induction of long-term potentiation.\n\nConclusionThese findings demonstrate that a computational model-driven behavioral intervention can enhance associative learning in mammals, and may provide insight into strategies to improve cognition in humans.",

    "abstract": "KCa2.1-3 Ca2+-activated K+-channels (SK) require calmodulin to gate in response to cellular Ca2+. A model for SK gating proposes that the N-terminal domain (N-lobe) of calmodulin is required for activation, but an immobile C-terminal domain (C-lobe) has constitutive, Ca2+-independent binding. Although structures support a domain-driven hypothesis of SK gate activation by calmodulin, only a partial understanding is possible without measuring both channel activity and protein binding. We measured SK2 (KCa2.2) activity using inside-out patch recordings. Currents from calmodulin-disrupted SK2 channels can be restored with exogenously applied calmodulin. We find that SK2 activity only approaches full activation with full-length calmodulin with both an N- and C-lobe. We measured calmodulin binding to a C-terminal SK peptide (SKp) using both composition-gradient multi-angle light scattering and tryptophan emission spectra. Isolated lobes bind to SKp with high affinity, but isolated lobes do not rescue SK2 activity. Consistent with earlier models, N-lobe binding to SKp is stronger in Ca2+, and C-lobe binding affinity is strong independent of Ca2+. However, a native tryptophan in SKp is sensitive to Ca2+ binding to both the N- and C-lobes of calmodulin at Ca2+ concentrations that activate SK2, demonstrating that the C-lobe interaction with SKp changes with Ca2+. Our peptide binding data and electrophysiology show that SK gating models need deeper scrutiny. We suggest that the Ca2+-dependent associations of both lobes of calmodulin to SKp are crucial events during gating. Additional investigations are necessary to complete a mechanistic gating model consistent with binding, physiology, and structure.",

However, few reports have focused on small molecules that can reduce their aggregation and cytotoxicity. Here, we show that short RNA repeats of GGGGCC and AAAAUU are aggregation-suppressors of TDP-43 and TDP25. TDP25 interacts with these RNAs, as well as TDP-43, despite the lack of major RNA-recognition motifs, using fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. Expression of these RNAs significantly decreases the cells harboring cytoplasmic aggregates of TDP-43 and TDP25 and ameliorates rounded and shrinking cells by mislocalized TDP-43; furthermore, the cellular transcriptome is not altered. Consequently, these RNAs can maintain proteostasis by preventing aggregation of TDP-43 and TDP25.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSocial anxiety symptoms are most likely to emerge during adolescence, a developmental window marked by heightened concern over peer evaluation. However, the neurocognitive mechanism(s) underlying adolescent social anxiety remain unclear. Emerging work points to the error-related negativity (ERN) as a potential neural marker of exaggerated self/error-monitoring in social anxiety, particularly for errors committed in front of peers.However, social anxiety symptoms are marked by heterogeneity and it remains unclear exactly what domain(s) of social anxiety symptoms are associated with ERN variation in peer presence, particularly within the adolescent period.\n\nMethodsTo advance and deepen the mechanistic understanding of the ERNs putative role as a neural marker for social anxiety in adolescence, we leveraged a social manipulation procedure and assessed a developmentally-salient domain of social anxiety during adolescence--Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE). Adolescents residing in Hanzhong, a small city in the southwestern region of mainland China, had EEG recorded while performing a flanker task, twice (peer presence/absence); FNE, as well as global social anxiety symptoms were assessed.\n\nResultsOverall ERN increases in peer presence. FNE specifically, but not global levels of social anxiety symptoms, predicted ERN in peer presence.\n\nConclusionsThese data are the first demonstration that the ERN relates to a specific domain of social anxiety in adolescents, as well as the first evidence of such relations within a non-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) sample. Results have important implications for theory and research into adolescent social anxiety.",

    "abstract": "Classical theory predicted that natural selection favors a variant causing smaller fluctuation of population density. It is also known that if population is partially protected from fluctuating selection, as in the case of seed bank, the variance of fitness is further reduced and therefore the reproductive success of population is ensured. This study, exploring a mathematical model for coupled demographic and evolutionary dynamics, finds that such a  refuge from fluctuating selection even causes positive selection for a variant increasing the amplitude of population size fluctuation under weak or moderate regulation of population density. Under strong density regulation and constant carrying capacity, long-term maintenance of polymorphism known as the storage effect emerges. However, if the carrying capacity is changing either cyclically or randomly and the density regulation is strong, variants whose fitness fluctuates in phase with population size are positively selected to either fixation or oscillation at intermediate frequencies. The latter dynamics, arising when fitness fluctuates as expected under a simple life-history trade-off, is a novel form of balancing selection. These results highlight the importance of allowing in models the joint demographic and population genetic changes, the failure of which prevents the discovery of important and novel eco-evolutionary dynamics.",

We present the largest investigation to date of microbes in blood, based on shotgun sequencing libraries from 9,770 healthy subjects. Leveraging the availability of data from multiple cohorts, we stringently filtered for laboratory contaminants to identify 117 microbial species detected in the blood of sampled individuals, some of which had signatures of DNA replication. These primarily comprise of commensals associated with human body sites such as the gut (n=40), mouth (n=32), and genitourinary tract (n=18), which are species that are distinct from common pathogens detected in clinical blood cultures based on more than a decade of records from a tertiary hospital. Contrary to the expectations of a shared blood microbiome, no species were detected in 84% of individuals, while only a median of one microbial species per individual was detected in the remaining 16%. Futhermore, microbes of the same species were detected in <5% of individuals, no co-occurrence patterns similar to microbiomes in other body sites was observed, and no associations between host phenotypes (e.g. demographics and blood parameters) and microbial species could be established. Overall, these results do not support the hypothesis of a consistent core microbiome endogenous to human blood. Rather, our findings support the transient and sporadic translocation of commensal microbes, or their DNA, from other body sites into the bloodstream.",

    "abstract": "Spliceosomal introns are gene segments removed (\"spliced\") from RNA transcripts by large ribonucleoprotein machineries called spliceosomes. In some eukaryotes a second spliceosome (the minor/ U12-type) is responsible for processing a tiny minority of introns. Despite its seemingly modest role, minor splicing has persisted for roughly 1.5 billion years of eukaryotic evolution. Identifying and cataloging minor introns in > 3000 eukaryotic genomes, we report diverse evolutionary histories including surprisingly high numbers of minor introns in some fungi and green algae, repeated massive loss, as well as several general biases in the positional and genic distributions of minor introns. We estimate that ancestral minor intron densities were comparable to those of the most minor intron-rich species, suggesting a trend of long-term stasis. Finally, three findings suggest a major role for neutral processes in minor intron evolution. First, we find highly similar patterns of minor and major intron evolution, in contrast to the predictions of both functionalist and deleterious models. Second, we find that observed functional biases among minor intron-containing genes are largely explained by these genes greater ages. Third, we find no association of intron splicing with cell proliferation in a minor intronrich fungus, suggesting that regulatory roles are lineage-specific and thus cannot offer a general explanation for minor splicings persistence. These data constitute the most comprehensive view to date of modern minor introns, their evolutionary history, and the forces shaping minor splicing, and provide a foundation for future studies of these remarkable genomic elements.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular machines are complex macromolecular assemblies that utilize thermal and chemical energy to perform essential, multistep, cellular processes. Despite possessing different architectures and functions, an essential feature of the mechanisms-of-action of all such machines is that they require dynamic rearrangements of structural components. Surprisingly, biomolecular machines generally possess only a limited set of such motions, suggesting that these dynamics must be repurposed to drive different mechanistic steps. Although ligands that interact with these machines are known to drive such repurposing, the physical and structural mechanisms through which ligands achieve this remain unknown. Using temperature-dependent, single-molecule measurements analyzed with a time-resolution-enhancing algorithm, here we dissect the free energy landscape of an archetypal biomolecular machine, the bacterial ribosome, to reveal how its dynamics are repurposed to drive distinct steps during ribosome-catalyzed protein synthesis. Specifically, we show that the free energy landscape of the ribosome encompasses a network of allosterically coupled structural elements that coordinates the motions of these elements. Moreover, we reveal that ribosomal ligands which participate in disparate steps of the protein synthesis pathway repurpose this network by differentially modulating the structural flexibility of the ribosomal complex (i.e., the entropic component of the free energy landscape). We propose that such ligand-dependent entropic control of free energy landscapes has evolved as a general strategy through which ligands may regulate the functions of all biomolecular machines. Such entropic control is therefore an important driver in the evolution of naturally occurring biomolecular machines and a critical consideration for the design of synthetic molecular machines.",

    "abstract": "Due to the accelerated appearance of antibiotic-resistant (AMR) pathogens in clinical infections, new first-in-class antibiotics, operating via novel modes of action, are desperately-needed. Brevicidine, a bacterial non-ribosomally produced cyclic lipopeptide, has shown potent and selective antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative pathogens. However, before our investigations, little was known about how brevicidine exerts its potent bactericidal effect against Gram-negative pathogens. In this study, we find that brevicidine has potent antimicrobial activity against AMR Enterobacteriaceae pathogens, with a MIC value ranging between 0.5M (0.8mg/L) and 2M (3.0mg/L). In addition, brevicidine showed potent anti-biofilm activity against the Enterobacteriaceae pathogens, with same 100% inhibition and 100% eradication concentration of 4M (6.1mg/L). Further mechanistic studies showed that brevicidine exerts its potent bactericidal activity via interacting with lipopolysaccharide in the outer membrane, targeting phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin in the inner membrane, and dissipating the proton motive force of bacteria. This results in metabolic perturbation, including inhibition of adenosine triphosphate synthesis, inhibits the dehydrogenation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides, accumulation of reactive oxygen species in bacteria, and inhibition of protein synthesis. Lastly, brevicidine showed a good therapeutic effect in a mouse peritonitis-sepsis model. Our findings pave the way for further research on clinical applications of brevicidine, to combat the prevalent infections caused by AMR Gram-negative pathogens worldwide.",

Using deep proteomic profiling, we systemically profiled lysosome-associated proteins linked with different longevity mechanisms. We further discovered the lysosomal recruitment of AMPK and nucleoporin proteins and their requirements for longevity in response to increased lysosomal lipolysis. Through comparative proteomic analyses of lysosomes from different tissues and labeled with different markers, we discovered lysosomal heterogeneity across tissues as well as the specific enrichment of the Ragulator complex on Cystinosin positive lysosomes.

    "abstract": "Reported insect declines have dramatically increased the global demand for standardized insect monitoring data. Image-based monitoring can generate such data cost-efficiently and non-invasively. However, extracting ecological data from images is more challenging for insects than for vertebrates because of their small size and great diversity. Deep learning facilitates fast and accurate insect detection and identification, but the lack of training data for coveted deep learning models is a major obstacle for their application. We present a large annotated image dataset of functionally important insect taxa. The primary dataset consists of 29,960 annotated insects representing nine taxa including bees, hoverflies, butterflies and beetles across more than two million images recorded with ten time-lapse cameras mounted over flowers during the summer of 2019. The insect image dataset was extracted using an iterative approach: First, a preliminary detection model identified candidate insects. Second, candidate insects were manually screened by users of an online citizen science platform. Finally, all annotations were quality checked by experts. We used the dataset to train and compare the performance of selected You Only Look Once (YOLO) deep learning algorithms. We show that these models detect and classify small insects in complex scenes with unprecedented accuracy. The best performing YOLOv5 model consistently identifies nine dominant insect species that play important roles in pollination and pest control across Europe. The model reached an average precision of 92.7% and recall of 93.8 % in detection and classification across species. Importantly, when presented with uncommon or unclear insects not seen during training, our model detects 80% of individuals and usually interprets them as closely related species. This is a useful property to (1) detect rare insects for which training data are absent, and (2) generate new training data to correctly identify those insects in future. Our camera system, dataset and deep learning framework show promising results in non-destructive monitoring of insects. Furthermore, resulting data are useful to quantify phenology, abundance, and foraging behaviour of flower-visiting insects. Above all, this dataset represents a critical first benchmark for future development and evaluation of deep learning models for insect detection and identification.",

    "abstract": "A recent paper by Rosenberg et al. [2022] found a surprising correlation between synonymous codon usage and the dihedral bond angles of the resulting amino acid. However, their analysis did not account for the strongest known correlate of codon usage: gene expression. We applied the approach of Rosenberg et al. [2022] to simulated protein-coding sequences that (1) maintain the general relationship between codon usage and gene expression and (2) completely random codon usage. The analysis of the simulated data assuming a general relationship between gene expression and codon usage returned results remarkably similar to the real data. More concerning was the large number of significant results detected when sequences with random codon usage were analyzed. We believe that the specific results of Rosenberg et al. [2022] were confounded by the relationship between codon usage and gene expression, but also that their method is generally prone to detecting noise in protein bond angle distributions.",

    "abstract": "Day-night environmental cycles together with our own adaptive rhythms in behavior and physiology lead to rhythmicity of various processes on the cellular level, including cell signaling. Despite many implications of such daily changes in signaling, the quantification of such rhythms and estimates of peak phases of pathway activities in various tissues are missing. Governed mainly by posttranslational modifications, a pathway activity might not be well quantified via the expression level of pathway components. Instead, a gene expression signatures approach can be used to score activity of various pathways. Here, we apply such gene expression signatures on circadian time series transcriptomics data to infer rhythmicity in cellular signaling. We show that, across multiple datasets, the gene expression signatures predict the presence of rhythmicity in EGFR, PI3K and p53 pathways in mouse liver. With the focus on EGFR pathway, we pinpoint the most influential signature genes for the overall rhythmicity in the activity scores for this pathway. These findings suggest that time of the day is an important factor to consider in studies on signaling. Simultaneously, this study provides a new paradigm to use circadian transcriptomics to get at temporal dynamics of pathway activation.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNatural quantitative variation in developmental processes must be driven by allelic variation. Yet, the genotype-phenotype relationships underlying developmental system variation are understudied due to their inherent complexity. Taking advantage of the simple Caenorhabditis elegans germline stem cell system, we characterized natural differences in the germ stem cell niche activity of two distinct wild isolates--measured as differences in germline progenitor zone (PZ) size. Through quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, we detected multiple candidate causal loci, including two large-effect QTL on chromosomes II and V. Resolving the chromosome V QTL, we show that the isolate with a smaller PZ exhibits a unique 148 bp deletion in the promoter region of the Notch ligand, lag-2, a central signal promoting germ stem cell fate and proliferation. As predicted, introducing this deletion into the isolate with a large PZ resulted in a smaller PZ. Unexpectedly, re-introducing the deleted ancestral sequence in the isolate with a smaller PZ further reduced PZ size. Using allelic replacement lines, we show that these contradictory phenotypic effects are due to epistatic interactions among the lag-2 promoter, the chromosome II QTL, and additional loci in the genome. Although the lag-2 deletion appeared to explain natural variation in germ stem cell niche activity, its effects across multiple genetic backgrounds were unpredictable due to higher-order epistasis. Studying the genetic architecture of quantitative developmental systems without taking into account its natural variation may be misleading, emphasizing the need for a better integration of developmental and quantitative genetics.",

    "abstract": "Cilia are found in eukaryotic species ranging from single-celled organisms, such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, to humans, but not in plants. The ability to respond to repellents and/or attractants, regulate cell proliferation and differentiation, and provide cellular mobility are just a few examples of how crucial cilia are to cells and organisms. Over 30 distinct rare disorders generally known as ciliopathy are caused by abnormalities or functional impairments in cilia and cilia-related compartments. Because of the complexity of ciliopathies and the rising number of ciliopathies and ciliopathy genes, a ciliopathy-oriented and up-to-date database is required. In addition, disorders not yet known as ciliopathy but have genes that produce cilia localizing proteins have yet to be classified. Here we present CiliaMiner, a manually curated ciliopathy database that includes ciliopathy lists collected from articles and databases. Analysis reveals that there are 55 distinct disorders likely related to ciliopathy, with over 4000 clinical manifestations. Based on comparative symptom analysis and subcellular localization data, diseases are classified as primary, secondary, or atypical ciliopathies. CiliaMiner provides easy access to all of these diseases and disease genes, as well as clinical features and gene-specific clinical features, as well as subcellular localization of each protein. Additionally, the orthologs of disease genes are also provided for mice, zebrafish, Xenopus, Drosophila, and C. elegans. CiliaMiner (https://kaplanlab.shinyapps.io/ciliaminer) aims to serve the cilia community with its comprehensive content, and highly enriched interactive heatmaps, and will be continually updated.",

Transposons are a known source of transcriptome diversity, however studies often focus on a particular type of chimeric transcript, analyze single body parts or cell types, or are based on incomplete transposon annotations from a single reference genome. In this work, we have implemented a method based on de novo transcriptome assembly that minimizes the potential sources of errors while identifying a comprehensive set of gene-TE chimeras. We applied this method to head, gut and ovary dissected from five Drosophila melanogaster natural strains, with individual reference genomes available. We found that [~]19% of body part- specific transcripts are gene-TE chimeras. Overall, chimeric transcripts contribute a mean of 43% to the total gene expression, and they provide DNA binding, catalytic activity, and DNA polymerase activity protein domains. Our comprehensive dataset is a rich resource for follow- up analysis. Moreover, because transposable elements are present in virtually all species sequenced to date, their relevant role in spatially restricted transcript expression is likely not exclusive to the species analyzed in this work.",

We analyzed and compared the chrY enrichment of sequencing data obtained using two different selective sequencing approaches: adaptive sampling and flow cytometry chromosome sorting. We show that adaptive sampling can produce data to create assemblies comparable to chromosome sorting while being a less expensive and time-consuming technique. We also assessed haplogroup-specific structural variants, which would be otherwise difficult to study using short-read sequencing data only. Finally, we took advantage of this technology to detect and profile epigenetic modifications amongst the considered haplogroups.

While CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a central role in preventing autoimmunity, the molecular mechanism underlying their dysfunction is unknown. Here, we performed comprehensive transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of Tregs in the autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS) to identify central transcriptional programs regulating human autoimmunity. We discovered that upregulation of a primate-specific short PRDM1 isoform (PRDM1-S) induces SGK1 independent from evolutionally conserved long PRDM1, leading to destabilization of Foxp3 and Treg dysfunction. This aberrant PRDM1-S/SGK1 axis is shared among other autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, by chromatin landscape profiling in MS Tregs we identified a PRDM1-S specific cis-regulatory element associated with enriched binding of AP-1/IRF transcription factors. Our study identifies evolutionally emerged PRDM1-S and epigenetic priming of AP-1/IRF as key drivers of pathogenic Treg programs leading to human autoimmune disease.",

    "abstract": "Proper synthesis and maintenance of a multilayered cell envelope is critical for bacterial fitness. However, whether mechanisms exist to coordinate synthesis of the membrane and peptidoglycan layers is unclear. In Bacillus subtilis, synthesis of peptidoglycan (PG) during cell elongation is mediated by an elongasome complex acting in concert with class A PBPs (aPBPs). We previously described mutant strains limited in their capacity for PG synthesis due to a loss of aPBPs and an inability to compensate by upregulation of elongasome function. Growth of these PG-limited cells can be restored by suppressor mutations predicted to decrease membrane synthesis. One suppressor mutation leads to an altered function repressor, FapR*, that functions as a super-repressor and leads to decreased transcription of fatty acid synthesis (FAS) genes. Consistent with fatty acid limitation mitigating cell wall synthesis defects, inhibition of FAS by cerulenin also restored growth of PG-limited cells. Moreover, cerulenin can counteract the inhibitory effect of {beta}-lactams in some strains. These results imply that limiting PG synthesis results in impaired growth, in part, due to an imbalance of PG and cell membrane synthesis and that B. subtilis lacks a robust physiological mechanism to reduce membrane synthesis when PG synthesis is impaired.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding how a bacterium coordinates cell envelope synthesis is essential to fully appreciate how bacteria grow, divide, and resist cell envelope stresses such as {beta}-lactam antibiotics. Balanced synthesis of the peptidoglycan cell wall and the cell membrane is critical for cells to maintain shape, turgor pressure and resist external cell envelope threats. Using Bacillus subtilis, we show that cells deficient in peptidoglycan synthesis can be rescued by compensatory mutations that decrease the synthesis of fatty acids. Further, we show that inhibiting fatty acid synthesis with cerulenin is sufficient to restore growth of cells deficient in peptidoglycan synthesis. Understanding the coordination of cell wall and membrane synthesis may provide insights relevant to antimicrobial treatment.",

Agriculture has been attributed as a leading factor in AMR and multidrug resistance (MDR) associated with swine production estimated as one of the largest agricultural consumers of antibiotics. Therefore, studying and understanding AMR in swine has global relevance. AMR research has received increased attention in recent years. However, we are still building our understanding of genetic variation within a complex gut microbiome system that impacts AMR and MDR. In order to evaluate the gut resistome, we evaluated genetic variation before, during, and after antibiotic treatments. We studied three treatment groups: non-antibiotic controls (C), chlortetracycline (CTC) treated, and tiamulin (TMU) treated. We collected fecal samples from each group and performed metagenomic sequencing for a longitudinal analysis of genetic variation and functions.\n\nResultsWe generated 772,688,506 reads and 81 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). Interestingly, we identified a subset of 11 MAGs with sustained detection and high sustained entropy (SDHSE). Entropy described genetic variation throughout the MAG. Our SDHSE MAGs were considered MDR as they were identified prior to, throughout, and after CTC and TMU treatments as well as in the C piglets. SDHSE MAGs were especially concerning as they harbored relatively high variation. Consistently high variation indicated that these microbial populations may contain hypermutable elements which has been associated with increased chance of AMR and MDR acquisition. Our SDHSE MAGs demonstrated that MDR organisms (MDRO) are present in swine, and likely additional hosts contributing to global AMR. Altogether, our study provides comprehensive genetic support of MDR populations within the gut microbiome of swine.",

    "abstract": "The transmission of microbial symbionts across individuals and generations can be critical for animal development and survival. Likewise, the transmission of microbes across closely interacting species could also affect host biology. Army ants (Formicidae: Dorylinae) and their hundreds of closely associated insect species (myrmecophiles) can provide a unique insight into interspecific symbiont sharing. Here, we compared the microbiota of workers and larvae of the army ant Eciton burchellii with those of 13 myrmecophile beetle species using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. We found that the previously characterized symbionts of army ant workers (Unclassified Firmicutes and Unclassified Entomoplasmatales) were largely absent from ant larvae and from myrmecophiles, whose microbial communities were usually dominated by Rickettsia, Wolbachia, Rickettsiella, and/or Weissella. Strikingly, different species of myrmecophiles and ant larvae often shared identical 16S rRNA genotypes of common bacteria. In particular, army ant larvae, some workers, and several myrmecophile species often hosted identical Weissella (Lactobacillales), based on 16S rRNA and also protein-coding gene sequences. Also, we found high relatedness between some newly characterized Weissella and animal-associated strains from aquatic and marine habitats. Looking more broadly, we found Weissella OTUs in 11.6% of samples from nearly all habitats and environments characterized by the Earth Microbiome Project. Together, our data show that unrelated but closely interacting species can share much of their microbiota. The high relatedness of strains found across such disparate hosts as ants, beetles, trout, and whales suggests that some versatile microbes move between hosts and habitats despite few opportunities for direct interaction.",

    "abstract": "Severe weather events can dramatically alter a species evolutionary trajectory. Previous landmark studies on populations in transiently hostile environments have measured traits that are under direct selection during those events. However, phenotype shifts that are not inherently adaptive to the fluctuating environment may also occur. Stress, especially during development, can cause important phenotypic changes in individuals, including impaired learning. Thus, learned behaviors, such as birdsong, may exhibit unique evolutionary dynamics as a result of widespread environmental stress. We hypothesize that ecosystem-level stressors may cause population-level changes to birdsong as entire cohorts experience developmental stress, learn songs imperfectly, and become the song tutors for future generations. In 2016, an unprecedented drought affected western New York State, a hotspot for community-science-generated birdsong recordings, and presented a unique opportunity to test our hypothesis through a natural experiment. We analyzed publicly available community-science birdsong recordings of two species, Junco hyemalis and Melospiza melodia, recorded between 2006-2020 in the drought-affected region and two control regions. We found that population-level song features had changed in the species with more complex songs (song sparrow) in the drought area after 2016, but not in the control area or in the species with a simple song (dark-eyed junco), implying that stress-induced deficits may disproportionately affect song traits that are more difficult to learn. These results demonstrate that environmental events can drive population-level trait evolution due to disruption in learning, with potentially important implications for speciation.",

Finally, we detected increased erythronate concentrations in tumors relative to adjacent normal tissues from lung cancer patients.

    "abstract": "The ring-shaped cohesin complex is the key player in sister chromatid cohesion, DNA repair, and gene transcription. The loading of cohesin to chromosomes requires the loader Scc2 and is regulated by ATP. This process is also hindered by Smc3 acetylation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying this inhibition remains mysterious. Here we identify a novel configuration of Scc2 with pre-engaged cohesin and reveal dynamic conformations of the cohesin/Scc2 complex in the loading reaction. We demonstrate that Smc3 acetylation blocks the association of Scc2 with pre-engaged cohesin by impairing the interaction of Scc2 with Smc3s head. Lastly, we show that ATP binding induces the cohesin/Scc2 complex to clamp DNA by promoting the interaction between Scc2 and Smc3 coiled coil. Our results illuminate a dynamic reconfiguration of the cohesin/Scc2 complex during loading and indicate how Smc3 acetylation and ATP regulate this process.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundElevated serum erythritol is a predictive biomarker of diabetes and cardiovascular incidence and complications. Erythritol is synthesized endogenously from glucose, but little is known regarding the origin of elevated circulating erythritol in vivo.\n\nObjectiveIn vitro evidence indicates that intracellular erythritol is elevated by high-glucose cell culture conditions and that final step of erythritol synthesis is catalyzed by the enzymes SORD and ADH1. The purpose of this study was to determine if dietary intake and/or diet-induced obesity (DIO) affect erythritol synthesis in mice, and if this relationship is modified by loss of the enzymes SORD or ADH1.\n\nMethodsFirst, 8-week-old, male Sord+/+, Sord-/-, Adh1+/+, and Adh1-/- mice were fed either low-fat diet (LFD) with 10% fat-derived calories or DIO high-fat diet (HFD) with 60% fat-derived calories for 8 weeks. Plasma and tissue erythritol were measured using GC-MS. Second, wild-type 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice were fed LFD or HFD with plain drinking water or 30% sucrose water for 8 weeks. Blood glucose and plasma and urinary erythritol were measured in non-fasted and fasted samples. Tissue erythritol was measured following sacrifice. Finally, Sord+/+ and Sord-/- mice were fed LFD with 30% sucrose water for two weeks, then non-fasted plasma, urine, and tissue erythritol were quantified.\n\nResultsPlasma and tissue erythritol were not impacted by loss of Sord or Adh1 on LFD or HFD. In wild-type mice, consumption of 30% sucrose water significantly elevated plasma and urinary erythritol on both LFD and HFD compared to plain water. Sord genotype did not affect plasma or urinary erythritol in response to sucrose feeding, but Sord-/- mice had reduced kidney erythritol content compared to wildtype littermates in response to sucrose.\n\nConclusionsSucrose intake, not high-fat diet, elevates erythritol synthesis and excretion in mice. Loss of ADH1 or SORD does not significantly impact erythritol levels in mice.",

    "abstract": "Pyk2 is a multidomain non-receptor tyrosine kinase that undergoes a multistage activation mechanism. Activation is instigated by conformational rearrangements relieving autoinhibitory FERM domain interactions. The kinase autophosphorylates a central linker residue to recruit Src kinase. Pyk2 and Src mutually phosphorylate activation loops to confer full activation. While the mechanisms of autoinhibition are established, the conformational dynamics associated with autophosphorylation and Src recruitment remain unclear. We employ hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) and kinase activity profiling to map the conformational dynamics associated with substrate binding and Src-mediated activation loop phosphorylation. Nucleotide engagement stabilizes the autoinhibitory interface, while phosphorylation deprotects both FERM and kinase regulatory surfaces. Phosphorylation organizes active site motifs linking catalytic loop with activation segment. Dynamics of the activation segment anchor propagate to EF/G-helices to prevent reversion of the autoinhibitory FERM interaction. We employ targeted mutagenesis to dissect how phosphorylation-induced conformational rearrangements elevate kinase activity above the basal autophosphorylation rate.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=197 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518986v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (56K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17c310org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77884org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@79470dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@27d8fd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The level of each RNA species depends on the balance between its rates of production and decay. Although previous studies have measured RNA decay across the genome in tissue culture and single-celled organisms, few experiments have been performed in intact complex tissues and organs. It is therefore unclear whether the determinants of RNA decay found in cultured cells are preserved in an intact tissue, and whether they differ between neighboring cell types and are regulated during development. To address these questions, we measured RNA synthesis and decay rates genome wide via metabolic labeling of whole cultured Drosophila larval brains using 4-thiouridine. Our analysis revealed that decay rates span a range of more than 100-fold, and that RNA stability is linked to gene function, with mRNAs encoding transcription factors being much less stable than mRNAs involved in core metabolic functions. Surprisingly, among transcription factor mRNAs there was a clear demarcation between more widely used transcription factors and those that are expressed only transiently during development. mRNAs encoding transient transcription factors are among the least stable in the brain. These mRNAs are characterized by epigenetic silencing in most cell types, as shown by their enrichment with the histone modification H3K27me3. Our data suggests the presence of an mRNA destabilizing mechanism targeted to these transiently expressed transcription factors to allow their levels to be regulated rapidly with high precision. Our study also demonstrates a general method for measuring mRNA transcription and decay rates in intact organs or tissues, offering insights into the role of mRNA stability in the regulation of complex developmental programs.",

    "abstract": "AMBRA1 is a tumor suppressor protein that functions as a substrate receptor of the ubiquitin conjugation system as part of autophagy and cell-cycle regulatory network. The highly intrinsic disorder of AMBRA1 has so far precluded its structural determination. To solve this problem, we analyzed the domain organization and dynamics of AMBRA1 using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). High deuterium uptake indicates that AMBRA1 is a dynamic and largely unstructured protein, and can be stabilized upon interaction with DDB1, the adaptor of the Cullin4A/B E3 ligase complex. Here we present the cryo-EM structure of AMBRA1 in complex with DDB1 at 3 [A] resolution. The structure shows that parts of N- and C-terminal structural regions in AMBRA1 fold together into the highly dynamic WD40 domain, and reveals how DDB1 engages with AMBRA1 to create a binding scaffold for substrate recruitment. AMBRA1 uses its N-terminal helix-loop-helix and WD40 domain to bind the double-propeller fold of DDB1, whereas different regions target the specific cellular substrates for ubiquitination. We also demonstrate that DDB1 binding-defective AMBRA1 mutants prevent ubiquitination of the substrate Cyclin D1 in vitro and decreased number of autophagosomes in the cells. Together, these results provide structural insights into AMBRA1-ubiquitin ligase complex and suggests a mechanism by which the AMBRA1 acts as a hub involved in various physiological processes.",

    "abstract": "The partnership of DNA deaminase enzymes with CRISPR-Cas nucleases is now a well-established method to enable targeted genomic base editing. However, an understanding of how Cas9 and DNA deaminases collaborate to shape base editor (BE) outcomes has been lacking. Here, we support a novel mechanistic model of base editing by deriving a range of hyperactive activation-induced deaminase (AID) base editors (hBEs) and exploiting their characteristic diversifying activity. Our model involves multiple layers of previously underappreciated cooperativity in BE steps including: (1) Cas9 binding can potentially expose both DNA strands for  capture by the deaminase, a feature that is enhanced by guide RNA mismatches; (2) after strand capture, the intrinsic activity of the DNA deaminase can tune window size and base editing efficiency; (3) Cas9 defines the boundaries of editing on each strand, with deamination blocked by Cas9 binding to either the PAM or the protospacer; and (4) non-canonical edits on the guide RNA bound strand can be further elicited by changing which strand is nicked by Cas9. Leveraging insights from our mechanistic model, we create novel hBEs that can remarkably generate simultaneous C>T and G>A transitions over >65 bp with significant potential for targeted gene diversification.",

While correlations between mRNA structure and expression are well established, no model to date has succeeded in effectively utilising this information to accurately predict expression levels. Here we present ExpressUrself, a model designed to capture spatial characteristics of the sequence surrounding the start codon of an mRNA transcript, and intended to be used for optimising protein expression.

    "abstract": "Cell mechanical properties have been proposed as label free markers for diagnostic purposes in diseases such as cancer. Cancer cells show altered mechanical phenotypes compared to their healthy counterparts. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a widely utilized tool to study cell mechanics. These measurements often need skilful users, physical modelling of mechanical properties and expertise in data interpretation. Together with the need to perform many measurements for statistical significance and to probe wide enough areas in tissue structures, the application of machine learning and artificial neural network techniques to automatically classify AFM datasets has received interest recently. We propose the use of self-organizing maps (SOMs) as unsupervised artificial neural network applied to mechanical measurements performed via AFM on epithelial breast cancer cells treated with different substances that affect estrogen receptor signalling. We show changes in mechanical properties due to treatments, as estrogen softened the cells, while resveratrol led to an increase in cell stiffness and viscosity. These data were then used as input for SOMs. Our approach was able to distinguish between estrogen treated, control and resveratrol treated cells in an unsupervised manner. In addition, the maps enabled investigation of the relationship of the input variables.",

    "abstract": "The BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax has recently emerged as an important component of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) therapy. Notably, use of this agent has revealed a previously unrecognized form of pathogenesis characterized by monocytic disease progression. We demonstrate that this form of disease arises from a fundamentally different type of leukemia stem cell (LSC), which we designate as monocytic LSC (m-LSC), that is developmentally and clinically distinct from the more well-described primitive LSC (p-LSC). The m-LSC is distinguished by a unique immunophenotype (CD34-, CD4+, CD11b-, CD14-, CD36-), unique transcriptional state, reliance on purine/pyrimidine metabolism, and selective sensitivity to cladribine. Critically, in some instances m-LSC and p-LSC subtypes can co-reside in the same AML patient and simultaneously contribute to overall tumor complexity. Thus, our findings demonstrate that LSC heterogeneity has direct clinical significance and highlights the need to distinguish and target m-LSCs as a means to improve clinical outcomes with venetoclax-based regimens.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThese studies identify and characterize a new type of human acute myeloid leukemia stem cell (LSC) that is responsible for monocytic disease progression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients treated with venetoclax-based regimens.

Although few genotypes were identified with contrasting tolerance to Fe deficiency, the molecular insight into the distinct biochemical and transcriptional responses determining the trait is poorly known. This study aimed to identify the molecular and biochemical basis for the contrasting Fe deficiency tolerance in wheat genotype showing tolerance to Fe deficiency (cv. Kanchan-KAN) compared to susceptible (cv. PBW343-PBW) cultivar. Under Fe deficiency, the KAN show delayed chlorosis, high SPAD values and low malondialdehyde activity compared to PBW. The shoot transcriptomics studies show that a large set of genes for photosynthetic pathways were highly induced in PBW, suggesting its sensitivity to Fe deficiency. Although, under Fe deficiency, both the cultivars show distinct molecular re-arrangements, including high expression of genes involved in Fe uptake (including membrane transporters) and mobilization, the gene expression level was higher in KAN. Furthermore, the KAN cultivar also shows high ubiquitination activity in the shoot tissue suggesting a high turnover of proteins in the tolerant cultivar. These observations were also co-related with the high root phytosiderophores biosynthesis and its release that contributes to the enhanced Fe translocation index in KAN. Overall, our work provides the key link to understanding the mechanistic insight for the Fe deficiency tolerance in hexaploid wheat.

Point-of-care drug manufacturing could circumvent these challenges since medicines could be produced locally and used on-demand.

As a model, we use this platform to synthesize a panel of peptide hormones, an important class of medications that can be used to treat a wide variety of diseases including diabetes, osteoporosis, and growth disorders. With this approach, temperature-stable lyophilized CFPS reaction components can be rehydrated with DNA encoding a SUMOylated peptide hormone of interest when needed. Strep-Tactin(R) affinity purification and on-bead SUMO protease cleavage yields peptide hormones in their native form that are recognized by ELISA antibodies and that can bind their respective receptors. With further development to ensure proper biologic activity and patient safety, we envision this platform could be used to manufacture valuable peptide hormone drugs at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings.",

Previously, a linear pathway for pleuromutilin biosynthesis was established.

Three novel pleuromutilin congeners were isolated, and their antimicrobial activity was investigated, alongside that of an additional derivative produced through a semi-synthetic approach. It was observed that the absence of substituents - C-3 keto, C-11 hydroxy or C-21 keto - from the pleuromutilin core affected the antibacterial activity of pleuromutilin congeners.

    "abstract": "BackgroundArchaea perform critical roles in the microbiome system, including utilizing hydrogen to allow for enhanced microbiome member growth and influencing overall host health. With the majority of microbiome research focussing on bacteria, the functions of archaea are largely still under investigation. Understanding methanogenic functions during the host lifetime will add to the limited knowledge on archaeal influence on gut and host health. In our study, we determined lifelong archaea detection and methanogenic functions while assessing global and host distribution of our novel archaeal metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs). We followed 7 monogastric swine throughout their life, from birth to adult (1-156 days of age), and collected feces at 22 time points. The samples underwent gDNA extraction, Illumina sequencing, bioinformatic quality and assembly processes, and MAG taxonomic assignment and functional annotation.\n\nResultsWe generated 1,130 non-redundant MAGs with 8 classified as methanogenic archaea. The taxonomic classifications were as follows: orders Methanomassiliicoccales (5) and Methanobacteriales (3); genera UBA71 (3), Methanomethylophilus (1), MX-02 (1), and Methanobrevibacter (3). We recovered the first US swine Methanobrevibacter UBA71 sp006954425 and Methanobrevibacter gottschalkii MAGs. The Methanobacteriales MAGs were identified primarily during the young, preweaned host whereas Methanomassiliicoccales primarily in the adult host. Moreover, we identified our methanogens in metagenomic sequences from Chinese swine, US adult humans, Mexican adult humans, Swedish adult humans, and paleontological humans, indicating that methanogens span different hosts, geography and time. We determined complete metabolic pathways for all three methanogenic pathways: hydrogenotrophic, methylotrophic, and acetoclastic. This study provided the first evidence of acetoclastic methanogenesis in monogastric archaea which indicated a previously unknown capability for acetate utilization in methanogenesis for monogastric methanogens. Overall, we hypothesized that the age-associated detection patterns were due to differential substrate availability via the host diet and microbial metabolism, and that these methanogenic functions are likely crucial to methanogens across hosts. This study provided a comprehensive, genome-centric investigation of monogastric-associated methanogens which will further our understanding of microbiome development and functions.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has been detected in the minor salivary gland (MSG) tissue of Sjogrens Syndrome (SjS) patients in the absence of an HBV co-infection. HDV antigen expression was previously shown to trigger an SjS-like phenotype in vivo, demonstrating a cause-and-effect association. We hypothesize that if HDV regulates SjS development, then HDV profiles may correlate with disease manifestations. This retrospective study characterized HDV in a cohort of 48 SjS MSG between 2014-2021. Analyses of HDV antigen (HDAg) expression, including cell type and subcellular localization, in situ hybridization of HDV RNA, and comparative analyses with associated SjS and viral hepatitis clinical features were conducted. HDAg was detected in MSG acinar, ductal, and adipose cells. HDAg localized with nuclei and mitochondria. HDV genomic RNA localized to the nucleus. A significant negative correlation was noted between HDAg intensity and focal lymphocytic inflammation. No significant associations were detected between MSG-localized HDAg and liver enzymes, or an evident HBV co-infection. This study has identified a non-hepatic reservoir for chronic HDV persistence in SjS-affected MSG and a unique mitochondrial localization for HDV antigen. Detection of non-hepatic HDV-mediated disease in the absence of an evident current or past HBV co-infection warrants further investigation.",

Pericytes stabilize the capillary structure and play an important role in the formation and maintenance of new blood vessels. Here, we characterized hypoxia-regulated circRNAs in human pericytes and showed that circPLOD2 is induced by hypoxia and regulates pericyte function. Silencing of circPLOD2 increased pericyte proliferation, endothelial-pericyte interaction and tube formation. Transcriptional profiling of circPLOD2-depleted cells and epigenomic analyses revealed widespread changes in gene expression and identified the circPLOD2-dependent regulation of the transcription factor KLF4 as a key effector of these changes. Importantly, overexpression of KLF4 was sufficient to reverse the effects on pericyte proliferation and endothelial-pericyte interactions observed after circPLOD2 depletion. Together, these data revealed a novel function of circPLOD2 in the control of pericyte proliferation and capillary formation and showed that circPLOD2-mediated regulation of KLF4 significantly contributes to the transcriptional response to hypoxia.\n\nHighlightsO_LIcircPLOD2 is upregulated in hypoxia in human vascular pericytes\nC_LIO_LISelective depletion of circPLOD2, but not linear PLOD2 mRNA, changes pericyte migration and endothelial-pericyte interaction\nC_LIO_LIcircPLOD2 depletion triggers widespread changes in gene expression that are mirrored in the transcriptional hypoxia response\nC_LIO_LIEpigenomic analyses pinpoint the transcription factor KLF4 as a central player in circPLOD2-mediated expression changes\nC_LIO_LIKLF4 overexpression is sufficient to rescue the changes in pericyte function caused by circPLOD2 depletion\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor TFEB promotes lysosomal and autophagic capacity in response to stresses like amino acid depletion. Additionally, TFEB drives expression of immune-responsive and immuno-protective genes in response to LPS, phagocytosis, and bacteria such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus. Consistent with a role for TFEB in promoting immunity and bactericidal activity, intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium and Salmonella appear to repress TFEB, whereas compounds that promote TFEB production or activity enhance macrophage killing of Salmonella. Intriguingly, Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) was observed to actively stimulate TFEB, implying a benefit to Salmonella during infection. To better understand the relationship between S. Typhimurium infection and TFEB, we assessed if S. Typhimurium regulated TFEB in murine macrophages in a manner dependent on infection conditions. Here, we show that macrophages that engulfed late-logarithmic grown Salmonella accumulated and maintained nuclear TFEB, comparable to macrophages that engulfed E. coli. In contrast, stationary-phase S. Typhimurium infection of macrophages actively delayed TFEB nuclear mobilization over the first hour of infection. The delay in TFEB nuclear mobilization was not observed in macrophages that engulfed heat-killed stationary-phase Salmonella, or Salmonella lacking functional SPI-1 and SPI-2 type three secretion systems. S. Typhimurium mutated in the master virulence regulator phoP or the secreted effector genes sifA, and sopD also showed normal TFEB nuclear translocation. Interestingly, while E. coli survived better in Tfeb-/- macrophages, S. Typhimurium growth was similar in wild-type and Tfeb-/-macrophages. Yet, priming macrophages with phagocytosis enhanced the killing of Salmonella in wild-type, but not in Tfeb-/- macrophages. Collectively, S. Typhimurium seems to orchestrate TFEB in a manner dependent on infection conditions, while conditions that disturb this context-dependent control of TFEB, such as forcing activation of TFEB seems to be detrimental to Salmonella survival.",

Staphylococcus aureus is a major human and animal pathogen, responsible for high levels of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The intracellular survival of S. aureus in macrophages contributes to immune evasion, dissemination, and resilience to antibiotic treatment. Here, we present a confocal fluorescence imaging assay for monitoring macrophage infection by GFP-tagged Staphylococcus aureus as a front-line tool to identify antibiotic leads. The assay was employed in combination with nanoscaled chemical analyses to facilitate the discovery of a novel, active rifamycin analogue.

    "abstract": "CLASPs regulate microtubules in many fundamental cellular processes. CLASPs stabilize dynamic microtubules by suppressing catastrophe and promoting rescue, the switch-like transitions between microtubule growth and shrinkage. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying CLASPs activity are not understood. Here, we investigate the effects of CLASPs on distinct microtubule substrates in the absence of tubulin to gain insight into how CLASPs regulate microtubule dynamics. Surprisingly, we find that human CLASP1 depolymerizes stable microtubules in the presence of GTP, but not in the absence of nucleotide. Conversely, CLASP1 stabilizes dynamic microtubules upon tubulin dilution in the presence of GTP. Our results demonstrate that CLASP1 drives microtubule substrates with different inherent stabilities into the same slowly-depolymerizing state in the absence of tubulin in a nucleotide-dependent manner. We interpret this state as the pre-catastrophe intermediate state between microtubule growth and shrinkage. Thus, we conclude that CLASPs stabilize the intermediate state between microtubule growth and shrinkage to suppress microtubule catastrophe and promote rescue.",

    "abstract": "Gene-body methylation (gbM) refers to sparse CG methylation of coding regions, which is especially prominent in evolutionarily conserved house-keeping genes. It is found in both plants and animals, but is directly and stably (epigenetically) inherited over multiple generations in the former. Studies in Arabidopsis thaliana have demonstrated that plants originating from different parts of the world exhibit genome-wide differences in gbM, which could reflect direct selection on gbM, but which could also reflect an epigenetic memory of ancestral genetic and/or environmental factors.\n\nHere we look for evidence of such factors in F2 plants resulting from a cross between a southern Swedish line with low gbM and a northern Swedish line with high gbM, grown at two different temperatures. Using bisulfite-sequencing data with nucleotide-level resolution on hundreds of individuals, we confirm that CG sites are either methylated (nearly 100% methylation across sampled cells) or unmethylated (approximately 0% methylation across sampled cells), and show that the higher level of gbM in the northern line is due to more sites being methylated. Furthermore, methylation variants almost always show Mendelian segregation, consistent with their being directly and stably inherited through meiosis.\n\nTo explore how the differences between the parental lines could have arisen, we focused on somatic deviations from the inherited state, distinguishing between gains (relative to the inherited 0% methylation) and losses (relative to the inherited 100% methylation) at each site in the F2 generation. We demonstrate that deviations predominantly affect sites that differ between the parental lines, consistent with these sites being more mutable. Gains and losses behave very differently in terms of the genomic distribution, and are influenced by the local chromatin state. We find clear evidence for different trans-acting genetic polymorphism affecting gains and losses, with those affecting gains showing strong environmental interactions (GxE). Direct effects of the environment were minimal.\n\nIn conclusion, we show that genetic and environmental factors can change gbM at a cellular level, and hypothesize that these factors can also lead to transgenerational differences between individuals via the inclusion of such changes in the zygote. If true, this could explain genographic pattern of gbM with selection, and would cast doubt on estimates of epimutation rates from inbred lines in constant environments.\n\nAuthor summaryGene-body methylation, the sparse CG methylation that is associated with house-keeping genes, is found in both plants and animals, but can be directly inherited in the former. Recently, we discovered that Arabidopsis thaliana originating from different geographic regions exhibit different patterns of gbM, which could be due to direct selection on gbM, but could also reflect a transgenerational memory of genetic or environmental factors. Here we look for evidence of such factors using a genetic cross between two natural inbred lines: one with high, and one with low gbM. We confirm that methylation states are stably inherited, but also see large somatic deviations from the inherited state, in particular at sites that differ between the parental lines. We demonstrate that these deviations are affected by genetic variants in interaction with the environment, and hypothesize that geographic differences in gbM arise through the inclusion of such deviations in the zygote.",

Most, if not all, genes residing in NUPTs/NUMTs (NUPGs/NUMGs) are known to be inactivated and pseudogenized. However, the role of epigenetic control in silencing NUPGs/NUMGs and the dynamic evolution of NUPTs/NUMTs with respect to organismal phylogeny remain barely explored. Based on the available nuclear and organellar genomic resources of the Triticum/Aegilops complex species, we investigated the evolutionary fates of NUPTs/NUMTs in terms of their epigenetic silencing and their dynamic occurrence rates in the nuclear diploid genomes and allopolyploid subgenomes. NUPTs and NUMTs possessed similar genomic atlas, including preferential integration to the transposable element-rich intergenic regions and generating sequence variations in the nuclear genome. The global transcriptional silencing of NUPGs/NUMGs with disrupted and intact open reading frames can be mainly attributed to their repressive chromatin states, namely high levels of DNA methylation and low levels of active histone modifications. Phylogenomic analyses suggested that the species-specific and gradual accumulation of NUPTs/NUMTs accompanied the speciation processes. Moreover, based on further pan-genomic analyses, we found significant subgenomic asymmetry in the NUPT/NUMT occurrence, which accumulated during allopolyploid wheat evolution. Our findings provide novel insights into the dynamic evolutionary fates of organelle-derived nuclear DNA in plants.",

We observe sex differences in the interactions between excitatory and inhibitory ACC neurons during parental care, and inactivation of ACC excitatory neurons increased pup neglect. Locus coeruleus (LC) releases noradrenaline in ACC during pup retrieval, and inactivation of the LC-ACC pathway disrupts parental care.

    "abstract": "The septin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated to interact with other cytoskeletal components to regulate various cellular processes, including cell migration. However, the mechanisms of how septin regulates cell migration are not fully understood. In this study, we use the highly migratory neural crest cells of frog embryos to examine the role of septin filaments in cell migration. We found that septin filaments are required for proper migration of neural crest cells by controlling both the speed and the direction of cell migration. We further determined that septin filaments regulate these features of cell migration by interacting with actin stress fibers. In neural crest cells, septin filaments co-align with actin stress fibers, and the loss of septin filaments leads to impaired stability and contractility of actin stress fibers. In addition, we showed that a partial loss of septin filaments leads to drastic changes in the orientations of newly formed actin stress fibers, suggesting that septin filaments help maintain the persistent orientation of actin stress fibers during directed cell migration. Lastly, our study revealed that these activities of septin filaments depend on Cdc42ep1, which co-localizes with septin filaments in the center of neural crest cells. Cdc42ep1 interacts with septin filaments in a reciprocal manner, with septin filaments recruiting Cdc42ep1 to the cell center and Cdc42ep1 supporting the formation of septin filaments.",
