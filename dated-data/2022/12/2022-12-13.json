    "abstract": "Spinal cord injuries have devastating consequences for humans, as mammalian neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) cannot regenerate. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), however, neurons may regenerate to restore lost function following injury. While mammalian CNS tissue softens after injury, how PNS tissue mechanics changes in response to mechanical trauma is currently poorly understood. Here we characterised mechanical rat nerve tissue properties before and after in vivo crush and transection injuries using atomic force microscopy-based indentation measurements. Unlike CNS tissue, PNS tissue significantly stiffened after both types of tissue damage, likely mainly due to an increase in collagen I levels. Schwann cells, which crucially support PNS regeneration, became more motile and proliferative on stiffer substrates in vitro, suggesting that changes in tissue stiffness may play a key role in facilitating or impeding nervous system regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Most human proteins lack chemical probes, and several large-scale and generalizable small-molecule binding assays have been introduced to address this problem. How compounds discovered in such \"binding-first\" assays affect protein function, nonetheless, often remains unclear. Here, we describe a \"function-first\" proteomic strategy that uses size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to assess the global impact of electrophilic compounds on protein complexes in human cells. Integrating the SEC data with cysteine-directed activity-based protein profiling identifies changes in protein-protein interactions that are caused by site-specific liganding events, including the stereoselective engagement of cysteines in PSME1 and SF3B1 that disrupt the PA28 proteasome regulatory complex and stabilize a dynamic state of the spliceosome, respectively. Our findings thus show how multidimensional proteomic analysis of focused libraries of electrophilic compounds can expedite the discovery of chemical probes with site-specific functional effects on protein complexes in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4) is the most important genetic risk factor for Alzheimers disease (AD). Among the earliest changes in AD is endosomal enlargement in neurons, which was reported as enhanced in ApoE4 carriers. ApoE is thought to be internalized into endosomes of neurons, while {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) accumulates within neuronal endosomes early in AD. However, it remains unknown whether ApoE and A{beta} intersect intracellularly. We show that internalized astrocytic ApoE localizes mostly to lysosomes in neuroblastoma cells and astrocytes, while in neurons it preferentially localizes to endosomes-autophagosomes of neurites. In AD transgenic neurons, astrocyte-derived ApoE intersects intracellularly with amyloid precursor protein (APP)/A{beta}. Moreover, ApoE4 increases the levels of endogenous and internalized A{beta}42 in neurons. Taken together, we demonstrate differential localization of ApoE in neurons, astrocytes and neuron-like cells, and show that internalized ApoE intersects with APP/A{beta} in neurons, which may be of considerable relevance to AD.",

    "abstract": "Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are devices designed for communication between the central nervous system and a computer. The communication can occur through different sensory modalities, and most commonly visual and auditory systems are used. We suggest that BCIs can be expanded by the incorporation of olfactory modality. To probe the modulation of EEG activity by odorants, we implemented two olfactory tasks: one that required attention to perception of odors, and the second one where participants discriminated consecutively presented odors. EEG recordings were conducted in 13 healthy participants while they performed the tasks following computer-generated verbal instructions. Respiratory activity was recorded to relate EEG modulations to the breath cycle. Theta activity responses were observed over the frontal EEG leads approximately 2 s after the inhalation. This theta activity was different depending on whether or not the inhaled air contained an odorant, and cognitive load also had an effect. We conclude that the frontal theta rhythm is reflective of the neural processing of odors. As such, it could be incorporated in the olfactory-based BCIs which take odors either as inputs or outputs. These BCIs could improve olfactory training needed for conditions like anosmia and hyposmia, and mild cognitive impairment.",

    "abstract": "We explore the world by constantly shifting our focus of attention towards salient stimuli, and then disengaging from them in search of new ones. The alpha rhythm (8-13 Hz) has been suggested as a pivotal neural substrate of these attentional shifts, due to its local synchronization and desynchronization that suppresses irrelevant cortical areas and facilitates relevant areas, a phenomenon called alpha lateralization. Whether alpha lateralization tracks the focus of attention from orienting toward a salient stimulus to disengaging from it is still an open question. In this study, we addressed this question by leveraging the well-established phenomenon of Inhibition of Return (IOR), consisting of an initial facilitation in response times (RTs) for target stimuli appearing at an exogenously cued location, followed by a suppression of that location. Our behavioral data showed a typical IOR effect with both early facilitation and subsequent inhibition. By contrast, alpha was lateralized only in the cued direction, but never re-lateralized in a manner compatible with the behavioral inhibition effect. Importantly, also the initial lateralization towards the cue ocurred too late to account for the behavioral facilitation effect. Furthermore, we analyzed the interaction between alpha lateralization and microsaccades: at the same time when alpha was lateralized towards the cued location, microsaccades were mostly oriented away from the cued location. Crucially, the two phenomena showed a significant positive correlation. These results indicate that alpha lateralization reflects primarily the processing of salient stimuli, challenging the view that alpha lateralization is directly involved in exogenous attentional orienting per se. We discuss the relevance of the present findings for an oculomotor account of alpha lateralization as a modulator of cortical excitability in preparation of a saccade.",

    "abstract": "Systems consolidation theories posit that consolidation occurs primarily through a coordinated communication between hippocampus and neocortex (McClelland and OReilly 1995; Kumaran et al., 2016; Moscovitch and Gilboa, 2022). Recent sleep studies in rodents have shown that hippocampus and visual cortex replay the same information at temporal proximity (\"co-replay\") (Ji & Wilson, 2007; Lansink et al., 2009; Wierzynski et al., 2009; Peyrache et al., 2009). We developed a novel TR-based co-reactivation (TRCR) analysis method to study hippocampal-cortical co-replays in humans using functional MRI. Thirty-six young adults completed an image (face or scene)-location paired associate encoding task in the scanner, which were preceded and followed by resting state scans. We identified post-encoding rest TRs (+/- 1) that showed neural reactivation of each image-location trials in both hippocampus (HPC) and category-selective cortex (fusiform face area, FFA). This allowed us to characterize temporally proximal coordinated reactivations (\"co-reactivations\") between HPC and FFA. Moreover, we found that increased HPC-FFA co-reactivations were associated with incorrectly recognized trials after a 1-week delay (p = 0.004). Finally, we found that these HPC-FFA co-reactivations were also associated with trials that were initially correctly recognized immediately after encoding but were later forgotten in 1-day (p = 0.043) and 1-week delay period (p = 0.031). We discuss these results from a trace transformation perspective (Winocur and Moscovitch, 2011; Sekeres et al., 2018) and speculate that HPC-FFA co-reactivations may be integrating related events, at the expense of disrupting event-specific details, hence leading to forgetting.",

Animal experiments have shown that the MD enhances prefrontal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decision making under uncertainty. However, the computational mechanisms of this cognitive process remain unclear. Here we use performance-optimized computational models to dissect these mechanisms. We find that the inclusion of an MD-like feedforward module increases robustness to sensory noise and enhances working memory maintenance in the recurrent PFC network performing a context-dependent decision-making task. Incorporating genetically identified thalamocortical pathways that regulate signal amplification and noise reduction further improves performance and replicates key neurophysiological findings of neuronal tuning. Our model reveals a key computational mechanism of context-invariant, cell-type specific regulation of sensory uncertainty in a task-phase specific manner. Additionally, it makes experimentally testable predictions that connect disrupted thalamocortical connectivity with classical theories of prefrontal excitation-inhibition (E/I) imbalance and dysfunctional inhibitory cell types.",

We found reduced neural decoding of face identity around the N170 window in PS, and conjointly revealed normal non-face identification in this patient. We used Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) to correlate human EEG representations with those of deep neural network (DNN) models of vision and caption-level semantics, offering a window into the neural computations at play in patient PSs deficits.

PSs brain RDMs showed significant reliability across sessions, indicating meaningful measurements of brain representations with RSA even in the presence of significant lesions.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCurrent clinical assessments of Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rely solely on subjective symptoms and experiences reported by the patient, rather than objective biomarkers of the illness. Recent advances in data-driven computational approaches have been helpful in devising tools to objectively diagnose psychiatric disorders. Here we aimed to classify individuals with PTSD versus controls using heterogeneous brain datasets from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Working group.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed brain MRI data from 3,527 structural-MRI; 2,502 resting state-fMRI; and 1,953 diffusion-MRI. First, we identified the brain features that best distinguish individuals with PTSD from controls (TEHC and HC) using traditional machine learning methods. Second, we assessed the utility of the denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) and evaluated its classification performance. Third, we assessed the generalizability and reproducibility of both models using leave-one-site-out cross-validation procedure for each modality.\n\nResultsWe found lower performance in classifying PTSD vs. controls with data from over 20 sites (60% test AUC for s-MRI, 59% for rs-fMRI and 56% for d-MRI), as compared to other studies run on single-site data. The performance increased when classifying PTSD from HC without trauma history across all three modalities (75% AUC). The classification performance remained intact when applying the DVAE framework, which reduced the number of features. Finally, we found that the DVAE framework achieved better generalization to unseen datasets compared with the traditional machine learning frameworks, albeit performance was slightly above chance.\n\nConclusionOur findings highlight the promise offered by machine learning methods for the diagnosis of patients with PTSD. The utility of brain biomarkers across three MRI modalities and the contribution of DVAE models for improving generalizability offers new insights into neural mechanisms involved in PTSD.\n\nSignificance Classifying PTSD from trauma-unexposed healthy controls (HC) using three imaging modalities performed well ([~]75% AUC), but performance suffered markedly when classifying PTSD from trauma-exposed healthy controls (TEHC) using three imaging modalities ([~]60% AUC).\n Using deep learning for feature reduction (denoising variational auto-encoder; DVAE) dramatically reduced the number of features with no concomitant performance degradation.\n Utilizing denoising variational autoencoder (DVAE) models improves generalizability across heterogeneous multi-site data compared with the traditional machine learning frameworks",

    "abstract": "Speaking elicits a suppressed neural response when compared to listening to others speech, a phenomenon known as speaker-induced suppression (SIS). Previous research has focused on investigating SIS at constrained levels of linguistic representation, such as the individual phoneme and word level. Here we present scalp EEG data from a dual speech perception and production task where participants read sentences aloud then listened to playback of themselves reading those sentences. Playback was separated into predictable repetition of the previous trial and unpredictable, randomized repetition of a former trial to investigate the role predictive processing plays in SIS. Concurrent EMG was recorded to control for movement artifact during speech production. In line with previous research, event-related potential analyses at the sentence level demonstrated suppression of early auditory components of the EEG for production compared to perception. To evaluate whether specific neural representations contribute to SIS (in contrast with a global gain change), we fit linear encoding models that predicted scalp EEG based on phonological features, EMG activity, and task condition. We found that phonological features were encoded similarly between production and perception. However, this similarity was only observed when controlling for movement by using the EMG response as an additional regressor. Our results suggest SIS is at the representational level a global gain change between perception and production, not the suppression of specific characteristics of the neural response. We also detail some important considerations when analyzing EEG during continuous speech production.",

    "abstract": "Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death causes irreversible vision loss in patients with glaucoma and other forms of optic neuropathy because the mammalian retina and optic nerve lack endogenous regenerative capacity. RGC transplantation and optic nerve regeneration represent a potential translational approach to vision restoration in glaucoma secondary to RGC loss. Functional RGC replacement requires that 1) donor RGCs integrate into the recipient retina and receive synaptic input from afferent bipolar and amacrine cells and that 2) donor RGCs extend their axons and establish synaptic connections to appropriate neurons in the brain. Here, in an effort to address retinal integration, we demonstrate that the internal limiting membrane (ILM) acts as a physical barrier to the integration of transplanted human stem cell-derived RGCs (hRGCs) into the recipient retina following intravitreal transplantation in vivo. To circumvent the ILM barrier, we intravitreally injected the nonspecific protease pronase-E in immunosuppressed adult C57BL/6J mice prior to transplantation of hRGCs. Separately, we also transplanted hRGCs into adult Lama1nmf223 mice, which harbor a point mutation in their Lama-1 gene that causes developmental ILM dysgenesis. We assessed donor hRGC survival and engraftment using 3D reconstructions of confocal z-stacks in retinal flatmounts. Migration of surviving donor RGC somas into the recipient RGC layer significantly increased after proteolytic or developmental ILM disruption. Moreover, lamination of dendritic arbors into the recipient inner plexiform layer was observed exclusively following ILM disruption. To assess the clinical translatability of this finding, we transplanted hRGCs onto postmortem organotypic human retinal explant cultures and observed significantly increased engraftment following proteolytic ILM digestion. These findings enhance our understanding of the barriers faced by transplanted hRGCs in the adult murine and human retina and provide an avenue for clinically translatable regenerative medicine approaches to vision restoration in optic neuropathy.",

    "abstract": "Perceptual biases are widely regarded as a window into the computational principles underlying human perception. To understand these biases, previous work has proposed a number of conceptually different and even seemingly contradicting ingredients, including attraction to a Bayesian prior, repulsion from the prior due to efficient coding, and central tendency effects on a bounded range. We present a unifying Bayesian theory of biases in perceptual estimation. We theoretically demonstrate an additive decomposition of perceptual biases into attraction to a prior, repulsion away from regions with high encoding precision, and regression away from the boundary. The results reveal a simple and universal rule for predicting the direction of perceptual biases. Our theory accounts for, and leads to new understandings of biases in the perception of a variety of stimulus attributes, including orientation, color, and magnitude.",

While the effects of low-intensity ALAN on morphology and phenology are well known in laboratory and greenhouse studies, little is known about these effects of ALAN on wild plants. Moreover, how these morphological and phenological responses affect the fitness of wild plants is unclear.\n\nUsing the annual herbaceous plant, Elsholtzia densa, as a model species, we performed a field manipulation experiment and tested the responses of plant morphology, reproductive phenology, and reproductive capacity to ALAN.\n\nWe found that ALAN significantly increased the specific leaf area but decreased the number of secondary branches. It also advanced the onset of budding, blooming, fruiting, and seed maturity from 3.4 to 6.2 d. In addition, ALAN significantly increased the length of the top inflorescences of the species but decreased the percentage of the individuals with undeveloped top inflorescences. Consequently, ALAN reduced the number of fruity inflorescences.\n\nOur results demonstrated that low-intensity ALAN, even with a relatively short period of exposure (i.e., one growing season), could cause passive responses in morphological traits of the wild plant, resulting in a decline in its reproductive capacity. In addition, the advanced reproductive phenology (e.g., flowering and blooming) induced by ALAN may cause plant-pollinator mismatches and threaten species coexistence at the community level.",

Their reduced skeletons and limited number of phylogenetically-informative traits have long obfuscated morphological classifications. Sanger-sequenced molecular datasets have also failed to constrain the position of major lineages. Noteworthy, topological uncertainty has hindered a resolution for Neoholothuriida, a highly diverse clade of Permo-Triassic age. We perform the first phylogenomic analysis of Holothuroidea, combining existing datasets with twelve novel transcriptomes. Using a highly-curated dataset of 1,100 orthologues, our efforts recapitulate previous results, struggling to resolve interrelationships among neoholothuriid clades. Three approaches to phylogenetic reconstruction (concatenation under both site-homogeneous and site-heterogeneous models, and coalescent-aware inference) result in alternative resolutions, all of which are recovered with strong support, and across a range of datasets filtered for phylogenetic usefulness. We explore this intriguing result using gene-wise log-likelihood scores, and attempt to correlate these with a large set of gene properties. While presenting novel ways of exploring and visualizing support for alternative trees, we are unable to discover significant predictors of topological preference, and our efforts fail to favor one topology. Neoholothuriid genomes seem to retain an amalgam of signals derived from multiple phylogenetic histories.",

I analyse comparative data on grooming networks from a large sample of primate species and show that two different social grades can be differentiated in terms of network size and structure. I show that living in large, stable groups involves a combination of increased investment in bonding behaviours (made possible by a dietary adjustment) and the evolution of neuronally expensive cognitive skills of the kind known to underpin social relationships in humans. The first allows the stresses created by these relationships to be defused; the second allows large numbers of weak relationships to be managed, creating a form of multilevel sociality based on strong versus weak ties similar to that found in human social networks.",

    "abstract": "One of the hallmarks of the collective movement of large schools of pelagic fish are waves of shimmering flashes that propagate across the school, usually following an attack by a predator. Such flashes arise when sunlight is reflected off the specular (mirror-like) skin that characterizes many pelagic fishes, where it is otherwise thought to offer a means for camouflage in open waters. While it has been suggested that these  shimmering waves are a visual manifestation of the synchronized escape response of the fish, the phenomenon has been regarded only as an artifact of esthetic curiosity. In this study we apply agent-based simulations and deep learning techniques to show that, in fact, shimmering waves contain information on the behavioral dynamics of the school. Our analyses are based on a model that combines basic rules of collective motion and the propagation of light beams in the ocean, as they hit and reflect off the moving fish. We use the resulting reflection patterns to infer the essential dynamics and inter-individual interactions which are necessary to generate shimmering waves. Using an artificial neural network, trained to classify the direction of attack and the shape of the school based only on the flashes, we also provide a proof-of-concept, showing that flash patterns are indeed indicative of the state and dynamics of the school and the individuals composing it. Moreover, we show that light flashes observed by the school members themselves extends the range at which information can be communicated across the school. To the extent that the fish pay heed to this information, for example by entering an apprehensive state of reduced response-time, our analysis suggests that it may speed up the propagation of information across the school.",

    "abstract": "Gonadal sex steroids are important regulators of energy balance in adult rodents, and gonadectomy (GDX) has opposing effects on weight gain in sexually mature males and females. Puberty is associated with the emergence of sex differences in weight, body composition, and feeding behaviors, yet the role of gonadal hormones at puberty remains unclear. To address this, we performed GDX or sham surgery in male and female C57Bl/6 mice at postnatal day (P)25 (prepubertal) or P60 (postpubertal) timepoints and measured weight and body composition for 35 days, after which ad libitum and operant food intake was measured using Feeding Experimentation Device 3 (FED3s) in the home cage. Consistent with previous studies, postpubertal GDX caused weight gain in females and weight loss in males and increased adiposity in both sexes. However, prepubertal GDX decreased weight gain and altered body composition across the adolescent transition (P25 to P60) in males but had no effect in females. Despite the varied effects on weight, GDX decreased food intake and motivation for food as assessed in operant tasks regardless of sex or timing of surgery relative to puberty. Our findings indicate that GDX interacts with both sex and age at surgery to influence weight, body composition, and feeding behavior.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGonadectomy had opposing effects on weight in males and females when performed in adulthood.\nC_LIO_LIGonadectomy performed prior to puberty decreased weight gain in males but did not affect weight gain in females.\nC_LIO_LIAcross sex and age at surgery, GDX decreased ad libitum food intake and reduced operant responding for food.\nC_LIO_LIDecreased food intake under effortful conditions was not explained by body weight in GDX mice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Collagen is the main load-bearing component of cornea and sclera. When stretched, both of these tissues exhibit a behavior known as collagen fiber recruitment. In recruitment, as the tissues stretch the constitutive collagen fibers lose their natural waviness, progressively straightening. Recruited, straight, fibers bear substantially more mechanical load than non-recruited, wavy, fibers. As such, the process of recruitment underlies the well-established nonlinear macroscopic behavior of the corneoscleral shell. Recruitment has an interesting implication: when recruitment is incomplete, only a fraction of the collagen fibers is actually contributing to bear the loads, with the rest remaining \"in reserve\". In other words, at a given intraocular pressure (IOP), it is possible that not all the collagen fibers of the cornea and sclera are actually contributing to bear the loads.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the fraction of corneoscleral shell fibers recruited and contributing to bear the load of IOP has not been reported. Our goal was to obtain regionally-resolved estimates of the fraction of corneoscleral collagen fibers recruited and in reserve. We developed a fiber-based microstructural constitutive model that could account for collagen fiber undulations or crimp via their tortuosity. We used experimentally-measured collagen fiber crimp tortuosity distributions in human eyes to derive region-specific nonlinear hyperelastic mechanical properties. We then built a three-dimensional axisymmetric model of the globe, assigning region-specific mechanical properties and regional anisotropy. The model was used to simulate the IOP-induced shell deformation. The model-predicted tissue stretch was then used to quantify collagen recruitment within each shell region. The calculations showed that, at low IOPs, collagen fibers in the posterior equator were recruited the fastest, such that at a physiologic IOP of 15 mmHg, over 90% of fibers were recruited, compared with only a third in the cornea and the peripapillary sclera. The differences in recruitment between regions, in turn, mean that at a physiologic IOP the posterior equator had a fiber reserve of only 10%, whereas the cornea and peripapillary sclera had two thirds. At an elevated IOP of 50 mmHg, collagen fibers in the limbus and the anterior/posterior equator were almost fully recruited, compared with 90% in the cornea and the posterior sclera, and 70% in the peripapillary sclera and the equator. That even at such an elevated IOP not all the fibers were recruited suggests that there are likely other conditions that challenge the corneoscleral tissues even more than IOP. The fraction of fibers recruited may have other potential implications. For example, fibers that are not bearing loads may be more susceptible to enzymatic digestion or remodeling. Similarly, it may be possible to control tissue stiffness through the fraction of recruited fibers without the need to add or remove collagen.",

Hearables - devices worn in the ear - are of particular interest due to their ability to provide health monitoring in an efficient, reliable and unobtrusive way. Despite the considerable potential of these devices, the ECG signal that can be acquired through a hearable device worn on a single ear is still relatively unexplored. Biophysics modelling of ECG volume conduction was used to establish principles behind the single ear ECG signal, and measurements of cardiac rhythms from 10 subjects were found to be in good correspondence with simulated equivalents. Additionally, the viability of the single ear ECG in real-world environments was determined through one hour duration measurements during a simulated driving task on 5 subjects. Results demonstrated that the single ear ECG resembles the Lead I signal, the most widely used ECG signal in the identification of heart conditions such as myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation, and was robust against real-world measurement noise, even after prolonged measurements. This study conclusively demonstrates that hearables can enable continuous monitoring of vital signs in an unobtrusive and seamless way, with the potential for reliable identification and management of heart conditions such as myocardial infarction and atrial fibrillation.",

The amino acid tyrosine (Tyr/Y) is conserved across many species, proposedly holding important characteristics for the functions of FGF5. One-microsecond molecular dynamics simulations along with protein-protein docking and residue interacting network analysis were employed to investigate the structural dynamics and binding mode of both wild-type (FGF5-WT) and its mutated counterpart (FGF5-Y174H). It was found that the mutation caused decreases in number of hydrogen bonds within the protein, sheet secondary structure, interaction of residues 174 with others, and number of salt-bridges. On the other hand, the mutation showed increases in solvent accessible surface area, number of hydrogen bonds between the protein and solvent, coil secondary structure, protein C-alpha backbone root mean square deviation, protein residue root mean square fluctuations, as well as occupied conformational space. In addition, protein-protein docking integrated with molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics - Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) binding energy calculation demonstrated that the mutated variant possessed stronger binding affinity towards fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1). However, residue interaction network analysis demonstrated that the binding mode was drastically different from that of the FGF5-WT-FGFR1 complex. In conclusion, the missense mutation conferred more instability, stronger binding affinity towards FGFR1 but with distinctively altered binding mode or residue connectivity. These findings might help explain the decreased activation of FGFR1, underlying trichomegaly.",

    "abstract": "Biological networks that are formed through amalgamation of signaling pathways include recurrent configurations called network motifs. These statistically over-represented subgraphs are often formed through interconnected enzyme-substrate relationships that are known to result in highly dynamic downstream behavior, including oscillatory output. Such signals are abundant in biology: heartbeats, circadian rhythms, and cell cycles all exhibit characteristic frequencies. Though there has been great emphasis on how oscillations can be generated through network dynamics, little is known about oscillatory information processing or transduction capacity of network motifs. We employ ordinary differential equations-based dynamical modeling to understand how different network topologies impact oscillatory signal propagation through a multi-enzyme network. We model enzyme-substrate interactions of 20 commonly observed motifs using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We then perform deterministic Monte Carlo simulations using a range of biologically relevant enzymatic parameters and input frequencies. From these simulations, we quantify signal propagation characteristics using cluster analysis, categorize different motif responses based on output characteristics, and identify potential mechanisms for oscillatory signal processing using parameter sensitivity analysis. We see that the input-output responses depend on network topology and enzyme kinetic parameters. Enzymatic motifs show median oscillatory suppression of 30-135 decibels, with three-node coherent feedforward loops showing the lowest propensity for oscillatory signal suppression. Motifs that contained negative feedback or four-node coherent feedforward loops had the biggest potential to act as AC-to-DC converters, translating oscillatory input signals into transient impulses or sustained continuous outputs, respectively. We conclude that enzyme networks can process and decode information within oscillatory inputs in a frequency- and network-dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Identifying causal relations or causal networks among molecules/genes, rather than just their correlations, is of great importance but challenging in biology and medical field, which is essential for unravelling molecular mechanisms of disease progression and developing effective therapies for disease treatment. However, there is still a lack of high-quality causal inference algorithms for any observed data in contrast to time series data. In this study, we developed a new causal concept for any observed data and its causal inference algorithm built on cross-validated predictability (CVP) can quantify the causal effects among molecules/genes in the whole system. The causality was extensively validated by combining a large variety of statistical simulation experiments and available benchmark data (simulated data and various real data). Combining the predicted causal network and the real benchmark network, the CVP algorithm demonstrates high accuracy and strong robustness in comparison with the mainstream algorithms. In particular, the CVP algorithm is robust in identifying reliable driver genes and network biomarkers from the perspective of network biology, with the prediction results outperforming the mainstream conventional methods for predicting driver genes. CRISPR-Cas9 knockdown experiments in the liver cancer have validated that the functional driver genes identified by the CVP algorithm effectively inhibit the growth and colony formation of liver cancer cells. By knockdown experiments, we demonstrated the accuracy and significance of the causality predicted by CVP and identified the novel regulatory targets of functional driver genes SNRNP200 and RALGAPB in the liver cancer. These inferred causal networks explain regulatory patterns in different biological contexts in a clear sense and provide biological insights into molecular mechanisms of disease progression from a causality perspective.",

NMDARs are tetrameric receptors and can be found at the membrane of neurons in various compositions, namely in di- or tri-heteromeric forms. The GluN2B subunit appears very early in development and, therefore, prenatally this subunit is predominantly found within di-heteromeric receptors, exclusively composed of the GluN1 and GluN2B subunits. Postnatally, however, the GluN2A subunit undergoes rapid increase in expression, giving rise to the appearance of tri-heteromers containing the GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B-subunits. The latter are emerging as the principal receptor-type postnatally. Despite more than a decade of research of numerous GRINopathies, not much is known regarding the effect of GRIN variants when these are assembled within tri-heteromers. Here, we have systematically examined how two de novo GRIN2B variants (G689C and G689S) affect the function of di- and tri-heteromers. We show that whereas a single mutated subunit readily instigates a dominant negative effect over glutamate affinity of tri-heteromers, it does not dominate other features of the receptor, notably potentiation by pregnanolone-sulfate (PS). This led us to explore PS as a potential treatment for these two severe loss-of-function (LoF) mutations in cultured neurons, in which case we indeed find that the neurosteroid rescues current amplitudes. Together, we present the first report to examine LoF GRIN2B mutations in the context of di- and tri-heteromeric receptors. We also provide the first demonstration of the positive outcome of the use of a GRIN2B-relevant potentiator in the context of tri-heteromers. Our results highlight the importance of examining how different mutations affect features in various receptor subtypes, as these could not have been deduced from observations performed on purely di-heteromers. Together, our study contributes to the ongoing efforts invested towards understanding the pathophysiology of GRINopathies as well as provides insights towards a potential treatment.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) serves as a powerful technique for assessing the causal role of specific brain regions in behavior, including decision-making. While tES studies investigating sensorimotor function yield unequivocal results, cognitive research reveals considerable ambiguity and diversity in stimulation-related effects. The consequences of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive functioning are not consistently predictable based on the current direction (cathodal or anodal), which limits its applicability in cognitive research.\n\nIn the present study, we further explored tES effect ambiguity in cognitive tasks by modulating medial frontal cortex (MFC) activity in an auditory monetary incentive delay (MID) task, where participants responded to acoustic cues encoding expected monetary losses using cathodal tDCS. We analyzed feedback-related negativity (FRN), reflecting prediction error processing when participants encountered losses compared to no losses during two subsequent MID task sessions, and exogenous P2 response to stimulus onset unrelated to anticipated monetary incentives. We anticipated an inhibitory cathodal tDCS effect on both P2 response and FRN.\n\nContrary to our expectations, we observed a facilitatory effect of cathodal tDCS on FRN, replicating our earlier results (Gorin et al., 2022). No effect of stimulation was observed on P2; however, tDCS influenced the learning effect of P2. The difference in P2 amplitude between the first and second sessions, observed in the sham group, was absent in the group that received cathodal tDCS. We offered the interpretation of the complex picture of tES effects during auditory MID performance in light of brain plasticity theory for P2 and reward-learning mechanisms for FRN. Importantly, our findings regarding the multidirectionality of tDCS effects on cognitive function challenge the utility of tES as a readily employable method for testing brain causality in highly complex neurocognitive events, such as decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Detailed single neuron modeling is widely used to study neuronal functions. While cellular and functional diversity across the mammalian cortex is vast, most of the available computational tools are dedicated to the reproduction of a small set of specific features characteristic of a single neuron. Here, we present a generalized automated workflow for the creation of robust electrical models and illustrate its performance by building cell models for the rat somatosensory cortex (SSCx). Each model is based on a 3D morphological reconstruction and a set of ionic mechanisms specific to the cell type. We use an evolutionary algorithm to optimize passive and active ionic parameters to match the electrophysiological features extracted from whole-cell patch-clamp recordings. To shed light on which parameters are constrained by experimental data and which could be degenerate, we perform a parameter sensitivity analysis. We also validate the optimized models against additional experimental stimuli and assess their generalizability on a population of morphologies with the same morphological type. With this workflow, we generate SSCx neuronal models producing the variability of neuronal responses. Due to its versatility, our workflow can be used to build robust biophysical models of any neuronal type.",

    "abstract": "The dual-process theory of action control postulates that there are two competitive and complementary mechanisms that control our behavior: a goal-directed system that executes deliberate actions, explicitly aimed toward a particular outcome, and a habitual system that autonomously execute well-learned actions, typically following an encounter with a previously associated cue. In line with dual-process theory, animal studies have provided convincing evidence for dissociable neural mechanisms, mainly manifested in cortico-striatal regions, involved in goal-directed and habitual action control. While substantial progress has been made in characterizing the neural mechanism underlying habit learning in animals, we still lack knowledge on how habits are formed and maintained in the human brain. Thus far only one study, conducted more than a decade ago by Tricomi et al. (2009), has been able to induce habitual behavior in humans via extensive training. This study also implicated the posterior putamen in the process, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, recent attempts to replicate the behavioral results of this study were not successful. This leaves the research of human habits, and particularly the research of their formation through extensive repetition, as well as their neural basis, limited and far behind the animal research in the field. This motivated us to (1) attempt to replicate the behavioral and imaging main findings of Tricomi et al., (2) identify further functional and microstructural neural modifications associated with habit formation and manifestation, and (3) investigate the relationships between functional and structural plasticity and individual differences in habit expression. To this end, in this registered report we used Tricomi et al.s free-operant task along with multi-modal MRI methods in a well-powered sample (n=123). In this task participants sensitivity to outcome devaluation (an index of goal-directed/habitual action control) is tested following either short or extensive training. In contrast to our hypothesis, we were not able to demonstrate habit formation as a function of training duration nor were we able to relate any functional or microstructural plasticity in the putamen with individual habit expression. We found that a pattern of increased activations in the left head of caudate that re-occurred across each days training is associated with goal directed behavior and that increased processing of devalued cues in low-level visual regions was indicative of goal-directed behavior (and vice versa). In a follow-up exploratory analysis comparing habitual and goal-directed subgroups within each experimental group, we found that elevated activations in frontoparietal regions during early stages of training, as well as increased reactivity towards still-valued cues in somatosensory and superior parietal regions were found in individuals that were more inclined to perform goal-directed behavior (compared with more habitual individuals). Taken together, regions commonly implicated in goal-directed behavior were most predictive of individual habit expression. Finally, we also found that differential patterns of training-related microstructural plasticity, as measured with diffusion MRI, in midbrain dopaminergic regions were associated with habit expression. This work provides new insights into the neural dynamics involved in individual habit formation/expression and encourages the development and testing of new, more sensitive, procedures for experimental habit induction in humans.",

    "abstract": "Predictive coding theory postulates that the brain achieves perception by actively making predictions about the incoming sensory information and correcting them if errors signals arise. These signals are likely the most relevant when the individual is actively interacting with the environment and where the sensory outcome determines the ongoing action. In addition, the cerebral cortex is thought to play a key role in generating these signals. Thus, to study the representation of error signals in the primary sensory cortex, we trained mice to perform an interactive auditory task that coupled their actions to the generated sound and perturbed this coupling to evoke putative error responses. We imaged Layer 2/3 (L2/3) and Layer 4 (L4) neurons in the mouse primary auditory cortex, and we identified not only neurons that mainly encoded action related information but also neurons encoding the mismatch between the action and the sound. These results show that a subset of A1 neurons encode the nonlinear interactions between the sound and the action. Furthermore, more L2/3 neurons encoded action related information than L4, indicating that action-sound integration emerges hierarchically in A1 circuits. Together, our results show that complex interactions between action and sound happen in A1 and that some A1 neurons responses reflect the violation of the learnt relationship between the action and sound feedback. Thus, primary sensory cortices not only encode sensory driven activity but also represent the complex interplay between sensory inputs, expectations, and errors.",

    "abstract": "During rest and sleep, memory traces replay in the brain. The dialogue between brain regions during replay is thought to stabilize labile memory traces for long-term storage. However, because replay is an internally-driven, spontaneous phenomenon, it does not have a ground truth - an external reference that can validate whether a memory has truly been replayed. Instead, replay detection is based on the similarity between the sequential neural activity comprising the replay event and the corresponding template of neural activity generated during active locomotion. If the statistical likelihood of observing such a match by chance is sufficiently low, the candidate replay event is inferred to be replaying that specific memory. However, without the ability to evaluate whether replay detection methods are successfully detecting true events and correctly rejecting non-events, the evaluation and comparison of different replay methods is challenging. To circumvent this problem, we present a new framework for evaluating replay, tested using hippocampal neural recordings from rats exploring two novel linear tracks. Using this two-track paradigm, our framework selects replay events based on their temporal fidelity (sequence-based detection), and applies a cross-validation using each events trajectory discriminability, where sequenceless decoding across both tracks is used to quantify whether the track replaying is also the most likely track being reactivated.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegeneration and its concomitant loss of cognitive function is associated with inflammation and an accumulation of lipids, in particular cholesterol. In the brain, cholesterol is made in astrocytes and transported to surrounding cells by apolipoprotein E (apoE). Elevated cholesterol promotes inflammation in peripheral tissues, but whether astrocyte cholesterol can drive inflammation in the brain is unclear. Here we show that pro-inflammatory cytokines induce cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes. The astrocytes release the cholesterol and immune cells take it up, which causes clustering of proinflammatory receptors in lipid rafts, perpetuating the inflammatory signal. Knockout of cholesterol synthesis in astrocytes blocks the production of inflammatory cytokines in an AD mouse brain and reduces neuroinflammation induced by peripheral injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the mouse. We conclude that astrocyte cholesterol is a paracrine signal to microglia and tissue-resident macrophages, resulting in increased neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "The biophysical properties of neurons not only affect how information is processed within cells, they can also impact the dynamical states of the network. Specifically, the cellular dynamics of action-potential generation have shown relevance for setting the (de)synchronisation state of the network. The dynamics of tonically spiking neurons typically fall into one of three qualitatively distinct types that arise from distinct mathematical bifurcations of voltage dynamics at the onset of spiking. Accordingly, changes in ion channel composition or even external factors, like temperature, have been demonstrated to switch network behaviour via changes in the spike onset bifurcation and hence its associated dynamical type. A thus far less addressed modulator of neuronal dynamics is cellular morphology. Based on simplified and anatomically realistic mathematical neuron models, we show here that the extent of dendritic arborisation has an influence on the neuronal dynamical spiking type and therefore on the (de)synchronisation state of the network. Specifically, larger dendritic trees prime neuronal dynamics for in-phase-synchronised or splayed-out activity in weakly coupled networks, in contrast to cells with otherwise identical properties yet smaller dendrites. Our biophysical insights hold for generic multicompartmental classes of spiking neuron models (from ball-and-stick-type to anatomically reconstructed models) and establish a direct mechanistic link between neuronal morphology and the susceptibility of neural tissue to synchronisation in health and disease.\n\nSignificance StatementCellular morphology varies widely across different cell types and brain areas. In this study, we provide a mechanistic link between neuronal morphology and the dynamics of electrical activity arising at the network level. Based on mathematical modelling, we demonstrate that modifications of the size of dendritic arbours alone suffice to switch the behaviour of otherwise identical networks from synchronised to asynchronous activity. Specifically, neurons with larger dendritic trees tend to produce more stable phase relations of spiking across neurons. Given the generality of the approach, we provide a novel, morphology-based hypothesis that explains the differential sensitivity of tissue to epilepsy in different brain areas and assigns relevance to cellular morphology in healthy network computation.",

    "abstract": "Computational models of cortical activity can provide in-sight into the mechanisms of higher-order processing in the human brain including planning, perception and the control of movement. Activity in the cortex is ongoing even in the absence of sensory input or discernible movements and is thought to be linked to the topology of the underlying cortical circuitry [1]. However, the connectivity and its functional role in the generation of spatio-temporal firing patterns and cortical computations are still unknown.\n\nMovement of the body is a key function of the brain, with the motor cortex the main cortical area implicated in the generation of movement. We built a spiking neural network model of the motor cortex which incorporates a laminar structure and circuitry based on a previous cortical model by Potjans and Diesmann [2]. A local connectivity scheme was implemented to introduce more physiological plausibility to the cortex model, and the effect on the rates, distributions and irregularity of neuronal firing was compared to the original random connectivity method and experimental data. Local connectivity increased the distribution of and overall rate of neuronal firing. It also resulted in the irregularity of firing being more similar to those observed in experimental measurements, and a reduction in the variability in power spectrum measures.\n\nThe larger variability in dynamical behaviour of the local connectivity model suggests that the topological structure of the connections in neuronal population plays a significant role in firing patterns during spontaneous activity. This model took steps towards replicating the macroscopic network of the motor cortex, replicating realistic spatiotemporal firing to shed light on information coding in the cortex. Large scale computational models such as this one can capture how structure and function relate to observable neuronal firing behaviour, and investigates the underlying computational mechanisms of the brain.",

    "abstract": "The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is a model animal that is being increasingly used in neuroscience research. A decade ago, the first study on unpredictable chronic stress (UCS) in zebrafish was published, inspired by protocols established for rodents in the early 1980s. Since then, several studies have been published by different groups, in some cases with conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review to identify studies evaluating the effects of UCS in zebrafish and meta-analytically synthetized the data of neurobehavioral outcomes and relevant biomarkers. Literature searches were performed in three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) and a two-step screening process based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. The included studies underwent extraction of qualitative and quantitative data, as well as risk of bias assessment. Outcomes of included studies (n = 38) were grouped into anxiety/fear- related behaviour, locomotor function, social behaviour, or cortisol level domains. UCS increased anxiety/fear-related behaviour and cortisol levels while decreased locomotor function, but a significant summary effect was not observed for social behaviour. Despite including a significant number of studies, the high heterogeneity and the methodological and reporting problems evidenced in the risk of bias analysis make it difficult to assess the internal validity of most studies and the overall validity of the model. Our review thus evidences the need to conduct well-designed experiments to better evaluate the effects of UCS on the behaviour of zebrafish.",

More recently, it has become widely appreciated that in individual trials, beta band activity occurs as transient bursts rather than amplitude-modulated oscillations. Most studies of beta bursts treat them as unitary, and having a stereotyped waveform. However, we show there is a wide diversity of burst shapes. Using a biophysical model of burst generation, we demonstrate that waveform variability is predicted by variability in the synaptic drives that generate beta bursts. We then use a novel, adaptive burst detection algorithm to identify bursts from human MEG sensor data recorded during a joystick-based reaching task, and apply principal component analysis to burst waveforms to define a set of dimensions, or motifs, that best explain waveform variance. Finally, we show that bursts with a particular range of waveform motifs, ones not fully accounted for by the biophysical model, differentially contribute to movement-related beta dynamics. Sensorimotor beta bursts are therefore not homogeneous events and likely reflect distinct computational processes.",

A computational framework was developed to construct a multiparameter OA-SPARC neuronal phenotype and to quantitatively assess phenotype reversal by candidate pharmacology with different mechanisms of action. We screened ~3000 approved drugs and mechanistically focused compounds, yielding data from over 1.2 million individual neurons with detailed assessment of both functional OA-SPARC phenotype rescue and orthogonal \"off-target\" effects.

Here we leverage the high spatial and temporal resolution of intracranial Electrocorticography (ECoG), to characterize how the key nodes of the AON - including precentral, supramarginal and visual areas - exchange information. We found more top-down beta oscillation from precentral to supramarginal contacts during the observation of predictable actions while more bottom-up gamma oscillation from visual to supramarginal contacts were measured for unpredictable actions. These results, in line with predictive coding, provide critical evidence towards an understanding of how nodes of the AON integrate information to process the actions of others.",

    "abstract": "The ubiquitous volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs), which are composed of LRRC8 proteins, facilitate cell volume homeostasis, and contribute to many other physiological processes. Prior studies demonstrated that treatment with non-specific VRAC blockers, or brain-specific deletion of the essential VRAC subunit LRRC8A, are highly protective in rodent stroke. In this work, we tested the widely accepted idea that harmful effects of VRACs in the brain are mediated by pathological release of the excitatory transmitter glutamate. We used two molecular genetic strategies to ablate LRRC8A expression in either brain astrocytes only (inducible deletion of Lrrc8aflox/flox with Aldh1l1CreERT2) or the majority of brain cells (neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes with NestinCre). To produce stroke, genetically modified mice were subjected to a 40-minute occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. The inducible deletion of astrocytic LRRC8A yielded no histological or behavioral protection. In contrast, the brain-wide LRRC8A knockout reduced ischemic infarction by ~50% in both heterozygotes (Het) and the full Lrrc8a knockout (KO) as compared to the control Lrrc8aflox/+ genotype. However, despite identical brain damage, Het and KO mice dramatically differed in their VRAC activities. Het mice had full swelling-activated glutamate release, while KO animals showed its virtual absence. These new findings refute the notion that VRAC-mediated glutamate release plays significant role in ischemic brain injury.",

    "abstract": "During visually guided reaching, proximal limb muscles can be activated within 80 ms of target appearance. Such \"express\" visuomotor responses are temporally aligned with target appearance rather than movement onset, and invariably tuned towards the direction of the visual target regardless of the instructed reach direction. These features prompt the hypothesis that express visuomotor responses are driven by a subcortical pathway. We tested this by measuring the changes in Motor Evoked Potential (MEP) size following Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) or Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) of the motor cortex, as participants reached either towards or away from visual targets. We found that 70-80 ms after target presentation, MEPs in a primary shoulder flexor muscle (pectoralis major) were oriented towards the target direction regardless of whether the participant subsequently reached towards or away from the target. Similar target-oriented MEP modulations occurred in posterior deltoid and biceps brachii muscles, whereas MEPs in a finger muscle were affected neither by target nor reach direction. Critically, there were no significant differences in modulation of responses to TMS versus TES across all reaching conditions, which suggests that the target-oriented modulation occurs downstream of the motor cortex output neurons. Combined, our results are consistent with a subcortical rather than cortical origin for the earliest changes in corticospinal excitability following visual target onset. A prime candidate for such subcortical modulation includes the superior colliculus and reticular formation.",

Structural analysis visualizing the XG005-Omicron spike binding interface revealed how crucial somatic mutations endowed XG005 with greater neutralization potency and breadth. A single administration of XG005 with extended half-life, reduced antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect, and increased antibody product quality, exhibited a high therapeutic efficacy in BA.2- and BA.5-challenged mice.

Due to their unique properties, inoviruses have also been utilised in biotechnology for phage display and as models for studying phase behaviour of colloidal rods. Inoviral phages secreted by bacteria can self-assemble into liquid crystalline droplets that protect bacterial cells in biofilms from antibiotics, however, factors governing the formation of such droplets and the mechanism of antibiotic protection are poorly understood. Here, we investigate the structural, biophysical, and protective properties of liquid crystalline droplets formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli inoviral phages. We report a cryo-EM structure of the capsid from the highly studied E. coli fd phage, revealing distinct biochemical properties of fd compared to Pf4 phage from P. aeruginosa. We show that fd and Pf4 form liquid crystalline droplets with diverse morphologies governed by the underlying phage particle geometry and biophysics, rather than their surface biochemical properties. Finally, we show that these morphologically diverse droplets made of either phage can protect rod-shaped bacteria from antibiotic treatment, despite differing modes of association with cells. This study advances our understanding of phage assembly into liquid crystalline droplets, and provides insights into how filamentous molecules protect bacteria from extraneous molecules under crowding conditions, which are found in biofilms or on infected host tissues.",

    "abstract": "The microbiota of multicellular organisms undergoes considerable changes during development but the general mechanisms that control community assembly and succession are poorly understood. Here, we use bacterial recolonization experiments in Nematostella vectensis as a model to understand general mechanisms determining bacterial establishment and succession. We compared the dynamic establishment of the microbiome on the germfree host and on inert silica. Following the dynamic reconstruction of microbial communities on both substrates, we show that the initial colonization events are strongly influenced by the host but not by the tube, while the subsequent bacteria-bacteria interactions are the main cause of bacterial succession. Interestingly, the recolonization pattern on adult hosts resembles the ontogenetic colonization succession. This process occurs independently of the bacterial composition of the inoculum and can be followed at the level of individual bacteria, suggesting that priority effects are neglectable for early colonization events in Nematostella. To identify potential metabolic traits associated with initial colonization success and potential metabolic interactions among bacteria associated with bacterial succession, we reconstructed the metabolic networks of bacterial colonizers based on their genomes. These analyses revealed that bacterial metabolic capabilities reflect the recolonization pattern, and the degradation of chitin might be a selection factor during early colonization of the animal. Concurrently, transcriptomic analyses revealed that Nematostella possesses two chitin synthase genes, one of which is upregulated during early recolonization. Our results show that early colonization events are strongly controlled by the host while subsequent colonization depends on metabolic bacteria-bacteria interactions largely independent of host development.",

    "abstract": "Ostreobium, the major algal symbiont of the coral skeleton, remains understudied despite extensive research on the coral holobiont. The enclosed nature of the coral skeleton might reduce the dispersal and exposure of residing bacteria to the outside environment, allowing stronger associations with the algae. Here, we describe the bacterial communities associated with cultured strains of 5 Ostreobium clades using 16S rRNA sequencing. We shed light on their likely physical associations by comparative analysis of three datasets generated to capture (1) all algae associated bacteria (2) enriched tightly attached and potential intracellular bacteria and (3) bacteria in spent media. Our data showed that while some bacteria may be loosely attached, some tend to be tightly attached or potentially intracellular. Although colonised with diverse bacteria, Ostreobium preferentially associated with 34 bacterial taxa revealing a core microbiome. These bacteria include taxa known as nitrogen cyclers, polysaccharide degraders, sulphate reducers, antimicrobial compound producers, methylotrophs and vitamin B12 producers. By analysing co-occurrence networks of 16S rRNA datasets from Porites lutea and Paragoniastrea australensis skeleton samples, we show that the Ostreobium-bacterial associations present in the cultures are likely to also occur in their natural environment. Finally, our data show significant congruence between the Ostreobium phylogeny and the community composition of its tightly associated microbiome, largely due to the phylosymbiotic signal originating from the core bacterial taxa. This study offers insight into the Ostreobium microbiome and reveals preferential associations that warrant further testing from functional and evolutionary perspectives.",

    "abstract": "Identification of the mechanisms of viral evasion from human antibodies is crucial both for understanding viral pathogenesis and for designing effective vaccines. However, the in vivo efficacy of the mechanisms of viral evasion from human antibodies has not been well documented. Here we show in cell cultures that an N-glycan shield on the HSV-1 envelope glycoprotein B (gB) mediated evasion from neutralization and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity due to pooled {gamma}-globulins derived from human blood. We also demonstrated that the presence of human {gamma}-globulins in mice and HSV-1 immunity induced by viral infection in mice significantly reduced the replication of a mutant virus lacking the glycosylation site in a peripheral organ but had little effect on the replication of its repaired virus. These results suggest that the glycan shield on the HSV-1 envelope gB mediated evasion from human antibodies in vivo and from HSV-1 immunity induced by viral infection in vivo. Notably, we also found that the glycan shield on HSV-1 gB was significant for HSV-1 neurovirulence and replication in the central nervous system (CNS) of naive mice. Thus, we have identified a critical glycan shield on HSV-1 gB that has dual impacts, namely evasion from human antibodies in vivo and viral neurovirulence.\n\nIMPORTANCEHSV-1 establishes lifelong latent and recurrent infections in humans. To produce recurrent infections that contribute to transmission of the virus to new human host(s), the virus must be able to evade the antibodies persisting in latently infected individuals. Here we show that an N-glycan shield on the envelope glycoprotein B of HSV-1 mediates evasion from pooled {gamma}-globulins derived from human blood both in cell cultures and mice. Notably, the N-glycan shield was also significant for HSV-1 neurovirulence in naive mice. Considering the clinical features of HSV-1 infection, these results suggest that the glycan shield not only facilitates recurrent HSV-1 infections in latently infected humans by evading antibodies, but is also important for HSV-1 pathogenesis during the initial infection.",

To improve its immunogenicity, we generated B/HPIV3/S-6P, expressing S further stabilized with 6 proline mutations (S-6P). Intranasal immunization of hamsters with B/HPIV3/S-6P reproducibly elicited significantly higher serum anti-S IgA/IgG titers than B/HPIV3/S-2P; hamster sera efficiently neutralized variants of concern (VoCs), including Omicron variants.

While injectable SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are effective against severe COVID-19, they do not fully prevent SARS-CoV-2 replication and transmission. This study describes the preclinical comparison in hamsters of B/HPIV3/S-2P and B/HPIV3/S-6P, live-attenuated pediatric vector vaccine candidates expressing the \"2P\" prefusion stabilized version of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, or the further-stabilized \"6P\" version. B/HPIV3/S-6P induced significantly stronger anti-S serum IgA and IgG responses than B/HPIV3/S-2P. A single intranasal immunization with B/HPIV3/S-6P elicited broad systemic antibody responses in hamsters that efficiently neutralized the vaccine-matched isolate as well as variants of concern, including Omicron. B/HPIV3/S-6P immunization induced near-complete airway protection against the vaccine-matched SARS-CoV-2 isolate as well as two variants. Furthermore, following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, immunized hamsters exhibited strong anamnestic serum antibody responses. Based on these data, B/HPIV3/S-6P will be further evaluated in a phase I study.",

Our results show that Gal4 cluster formation is facilitated by, but does not completely depend on DNA binding and intrinsically disordered regions. Gal4 cluster properties are regulated by the Gal4-inhibitor Gal80 and Gal4 concentration. Moreover, we discover that clustering acts as a double-edged sword: self-interactions aid TF recruitment to target genes, but recruited Gal4 molecules that are not DNA-bound do not contribute to, and may even inhibit, transcription activation.

Using one pool of native plant species and one pool of invasive alien plant species that naturally co-occur in China, we here tested in four separate experiments whether nutrient availability, allelopathy, soil microbiota and soil-legacy effects can all mediate the diversity-invasibility relationship. While soil-nutrient availability, allelopathy, soil biota and soil-legacy effects separately influenced biomass production of alien plant species and native plant communities, our results suggest that only soil biota and allelopathy influenced diversity-invasibility relationship in our study system. Importantly, by excluding the potential effects of allelopathy and soil biota in the nutrient-competition experiment, nutrient competition alone is not necessarily related to the negative diversity-invasibility relationship.",

    "abstract": "The floras on chemically and physically challenging soils, such as gypsum, shale, and serpentine, are characterized by narrowly endemic species. These edaphic endemics often have widespread close relatives that are not restricted to specific soil types. The evolution of edaphic endemics may be facilitated or constrained by genetic correlations among traits contributing to adaptation and reproductive isolation across soil boundaries. The yellow monkeyflowers in the Mimulus guttatus species complex are an ideal system in which to examine these evolutionary patterns. To determine the genetic basis of adaptive and prezygotic isolating traits, we performed genetic mapping experiments with F2 hybrids derived from a cross between a serpentine endemic, M. nudatus, and its close relative M. guttatus. Plants occurring on serpentine soils have repeatedly evolved short statures and small leaves, suggesting that these traits are adaptive, and M. nudatus shows all these characteristics compared to M. guttatus. Previous research demonstrated that flower size and life history differences between these species contribute to prezygotic reproductive isolation between them. Few large effect and many small effect loci contribute to interspecific divergence in life history, floral and leaf traits, and a history of directional selection contributed to trait divergence. Loci contributing to adaptive traits and prezygotic reproductive isolation overlap, and their allelic effects are largely in the direction of species divergence.

    "abstract": "Labeled {beta}-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) analogs have been critical for uncovering new biochemical connections and quantitating enzymatic activity. They function as tracers for enzymology, flux analyses, and in situ measurements. Nevertheless, there is limited availability of specific types of analogs, especially radiolabeled NAD analogs. Here, we describe an improved enzymatic synthesis reaction for 32P-NAD+ with a yield of 98% {+/-} 1%, using lowered concentrations of reactants and standard equipment. This represents the highest reported yield for the enzymatic synthesis of NAD+ to date. With the high yield we were able to directly use the reaction product to generate derivatives, such as 32P-NADP. The high-yield enzymatic synthesis is versatile for a broad variety of labels and NAD derivatives. Its advantages include lowered concentrations of reactants, providing sufficient amounts of product for downstream applications, and minimizing intermediate purification steps.",

However, not much is known about the dynamics of gut microbial lipids within the distinct gut biogeographic. Here we employed targeted and untargeted lipidomics in the in vitro derived feces. Simulated intestinal chyme was collected from in vitro gut vessels (V1-V4), representing proximal to distal parts of the colon after 24 and 48 h with/without PDX treatment. In total 44 simulated chyme samples were collected from the in vitro colon simulator. Factor analysis showed that vessel and time had the strongest impact on the simulated intestinal chyme lipid profiles. We found that levels of phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins, triacylglycerols and endocannabinoids were altered in at least one vessel (V1-V4) during simulation. We also found that concentrations of triacylglycerols, diacylglycerols and endocannabinoids changed with time (24 vs. 48 h simulation). Together, we found that the simulated intestinal chyme revealed a wide range of lipids that remained altered in different compartments of the human colon model over time.",

    "abstract": "Thirty percent of all mutations causing human diseases generate mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs). Recognition and degradation of these PTC-containing mRNAs is carried out by the mechanism known as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). Upf2 is a scaffold protein known to be a central component of the NMD surveillance pathway. It harbors three middle domain of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (mIF4G) domains in its N-terminal potentially important in regulating the surveillance pathway. In this study, we defined regions within the mIF4G-1 and mIF4G-2 that are required for proper function of NMD and translation termination in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Upf2. In addition, we narrowed down the activity of these regions to an aspartic acid (D59) in mIF4G-1 which is important for NMD activity and translation termination accuracy. Taken together, these studies suggest that inherent charged residues within mIF4G-1 of Upf2 play a role in the regulation of the NMD surveillance mechanism in S. cerevisiae.",

    "abstract": "Most vaccines require several immunizations to induce robust immunity, and indeed, most SARS-CoV-2 vaccines require an initial two-shot regimen followed by several boosters to maintain efficacy. Such a complex series of immunizations unfortunately increases the cost and complexity of populations-scale vaccination and reduces overall compliance and vaccination rate. In a rapidly evolving pandemic affected by the spread of immune-escaping variants, there is an urgent need to develop vaccines capable of providing robust and durable immunity. In this work, we developed a single immunization SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine that could rapidly generate potent, broad, and durable humoral immunity. We leveraged injectable polymer-nanoparticle (PNP) hydrogels as a depot technology for the sustained delivery of a nanoparticle COVID antigen displaying multiple copies of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding-domain (RBD-NP), and potent adjuvants including CpG and 3M-052. Compared to a clinically relevant prime-boost regimen with soluble vaccines formulated with CpG/Alum or 3M-052/Alum adjuvants, PNP hydrogel vaccines more rapidly generated higher, broader, and more durable antibody responses. Additionally, these single-immunization hydrogel-based vaccines elicited potent and consistent neutralizing responses. Overall, we show that PNP hydrogels elicit improved anti-COVID immune responses with only a single administration, demonstrating their potential as critical technologies to enhance our overall pandemic readiness.",

    "abstract": "Label-free detection and digital counting of nanometer-scaled objects such as nanoparticles, viruses, extracellular vesicles, and protein molecules enable a wide range of applications in cancer diagnostics, pathogen detection, and life science research. The contrast of interferometric scattering microscopy is amplified through a photonic crystal surface, upon which scattered light from an object combines with illumination from a monochromatic plane wave source. The use of a photonic crystal substrate for interference scattering microscopy results in reduced requirements for high-intensity lasers or oil-immersion objectives, thus opening a pathway toward instruments that are more suitable for environments outside the optics laboratory. Here, we report the design, implementation, and characterization of a compact Photonic Resonator Interferometric Scattering Microscope (PRISM) designed for point-of-use environments and applications. The instrument incorporates two innovative elements that facilitate operation on a desktop in ordinary laboratory environments by users that do not have optics expertise. First, because scattering microscopes are extremely sensitive to vibration, we incorporated an inexpensive but effective solution of suspending the instruments main components from a rigid metal framework using elastic bands, resulting in an average of 28.7 dBV reduction in vibration amplitude compared to an office desk. Second, an automated focusing module based on the principle of total internal reflection maintains the stability of image contrast over time and spatial position, facilitating automated data collection. In this work, we characterize the systems performance by measuring the contrast from gold nanoparticles with diameters in the 10-40 nm range and by observing various biological analytes, including HIV virus, SARS-CoV-2 virus, exosomes, and ferritin protein.",

    "abstract": "MotivationPhenome-wide association studies (PheWASs) serve as a way of documenting the relationship between genotypes and multiple phenotypes, helping to uncover new and unexplored genotype-phenotype associations (known as pleiotropy). Secondly, Mendelian Randomization (MR) can be harnessed to make causal statements about a pair of phenotypes (e.g., does one phenotype cause the other?) by comparing the genetic architecture of the phenotypes in question. Thus, approaches that automate both PheWAS and MR can enhance biobank scale analyses, circumventing the need for multiple bespoke tools for each task by providing a comprehensive, end-to-end pipeline to drive scientific discovery.\n\nResultsWe present PYPE, a Python pipeline for running, visualizing, and interpreting PheWAS. Our pipeline allows the researcher to input genotype or phenotype files from the UK Biobank (UKBB) and automatically estimate associations between the chosen independent variables and the phenotypes. PYPE also provides a variety of visualization options including Manhattan and volcano plots and can be used to identify nearby genes and functional consequences of the significant associations. PYPE additionally provides the user with the ability to run Mendelian Randomization (MR) under a variety of causal effect modeling scenarios (e.g., Inverse Variance Weighted Regression, Egger Regression, and Weighted Median Estimation) to identify possible causal relationships between phenotypes.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationPYPE is a free, open-source project developed entirely in Python and can be found at https://github.com/TaykhoomDalal/pype.

    "abstract": "As of early December 2022, COVID-19 had a significant impact on the lives of people all around the world, with over 630 million documented cases and over 6 million deaths. A recent clinical analysis revealed that under certain conditions, a patients disease symptoms are more likely to persist. Long COVID is characterised by many symptoms that continue long after the SARS-CoV-2 infection has resolved. This work utilised computational methods to analyse the persistence of COVID symptoms after recovery and to identify the relevant genes. Based on functional similarity, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of SARS-CoV-2 infection and 255 symptoms of long covid were examined, and potential genes were identified based on the rank of functional similarity. Then, hub genes were identified by analysing the interactions between proteins. Using the identified key genes and the drug-gene interaction score, FDA drugs with potential for possible alternatives were identified. Also discovered were the gene ontology and pathways for 255 distinct symptoms. A website (https://longcovid.omicstutorials.com/) with a list of significant genes identified as biomarkers and potential treatments for each symptom was created. All of the hub genes associated with the symptoms, GNGT1, GNG12, GNB3, GNB4, GNG13, GNG8, GNG3, GNG7, GNG10, and GNAI1, were discovered to be associated with G-protein coupled receptors. This demonstrates that persistent COVID infection affects various organ systems and promotes chronic inflammation following infection. CTLA4, PTPN22, KIT, KRAS, NF1, RET, and CTNNB1 were identified as the common genes that regulate T-cell immunity via GPCR and cause a variety of symptoms, including autoimmunity, cardiovascular, dermatological, general symptoms, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, reproductive, genitourinary, and endocrine symptoms (RGEM). Among other functions, they were found to be involved in the positive regulation of protein localization to the cell cortex, the regulation of triglyceride metabolism, the binding of G protein-coupled receptors, the binding of G protein-coupled serotonin receptors, the heterotrimeric G-protein complex, and the cell cortex region. These biomarker data, together with the gene ontology and pathway information that accompanies them, are intended to aid in determining the cause and improving the efficacy of treatment.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between genotype, age, and sex has potential to reveal factors that determine the switch between successful and pathological aging. APOE allelic variation modulate brain vulnerability and cognitive resilience during aging and Alzheimer disease (AD). The APOE4 allele confers the most risk and has been extensively studied with respect to the control APOE3 allele. The APOE2 allele has been less studied, and the mechanisms by which it confers cognitive resilience and neuroprotection remain largely unknown. Using mouse models with targeted replacement of the murine APOE gene with the human major APOE2 alleles we sought to identify changes during a critical period of middle to old age transition, in a mouse model of resilience to AD. Age but not female sex was important in modulating learning and memory estimates based on Morris water maze metrics. A small but significant 3% global brain atrophy due to aging was reflected by regional atrophy in the cingulate cortex 24, fornix and hippocampal commissure (>9%). Females had larger regional volumes relative to males for the bed nucleus of stria terminalis, subbrachial nucleus, postsubiculum (~10%), and claustrum (>5%), while males had larger volumes for the orbitofrontal cortex, frontal association cortex, and the longitudinal fasciculus of pons (>9%). Age promoted atrophy in both white (anterior commissure, corpus callosum, etc.), and gray matter, in particular the olfactory cortex, frontal association area 3, thalamus, hippocampus and cerebellum. A negative age by sex interaction was noted for the olfactory areas, piriform cortex, amygdala, ventral hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum, suggesting faster decline in females. Fractional anisotropy indicated an advantage for younger females for the cingulate cortex, insula, dorsal thalamus, ventral hippocampus, amygdala, visual and entorhinal cortex, and cerebellum, but there was faster decline with age. Interestingly white matter tracts were largely spared in females during aging. We used vertex screening to find associations between connectome and traits such as age and sex, and sparse multiple canonical correlation analysis to integrate our analyses over connectomes, traits, and RNA-seq. Brain subgraphs favored in males included the secondary motor cortex and superior cerebellar peduncle, while those for females included hippocampus and primary somatosensory cortex. Age related connectivity loss affected the hippocampus and primary somatosensory cortex. We validated these subgraphs using neural networks, showing increased accuracy for sex prediction from 81.9% when using the whole connectome as a predictor, to 94.28% when using the subgraphs estimated through vertex screening. Transcriptomic analyses revealed the largest fold change (FC) for age related genes was for Cpt1c (log2FC = 7.1), involved in transport of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria and neuronal oxidative metabolism. Arg1, a critical regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses (log2FC = 4.9) also showed age specific changes. Amongst the sex related genes, the largest FC were observed for Maoa (log2FC = 4.9) involved in the degradation of the neurotransmitters serotonin, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and implicated in response to stress. Four genes were common for age and sex related vulnerability: Myo1e (log2FC = -1.5), Creld2 (log2FC = 1.4), Ptprt (log2FC = 2.9), and Pex1 (log2FC = 3.6). We tested whether blood gene expression help track phenotype changes with age and sex. Genes with the highest weight after connectome filtering included Ankzfp1 with a role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity under stress, as well as Pex1, Cep250, Nat14, Arg1, and Rangrf. Connectome filtered genes pointed to pathways relate to stress response, transport, and metabolic processes. Our modeling approaches using sparse canonical correlation analysis help relate quantitative traits to vulnerable brain networks, and blood markers for biological processes. Our study shows the APOE2 impact on neurocognition, brain networks, and biological pathways during a critical middle to old age transition in an animal model of resilience. Identifying changes in vulnerable brain and gene networks and markers of resilience may help reveal targets for therapies that support successful aging.",

Experimental pain models that mimic the symptoms of clinical TMD may be useful in understanding the mechanisms, and sex differences, present in this disorder. Here we aimed to comprehensively characterise the nature and time-course of pain, functional impairment and hyperalgesia induced by repeated intramuscular injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) into the masseter muscle, and to investigate sex differences in the NGF-induced pain experience.\n\nMethods94 healthy individuals participated in a longitudinal observational study with 30-day follow-up. NGF was injected into the right masseter muscle on Day 0 and Day 2. Participants attended laboratory sessions to assess pain (Numerical Rating Scale; NRS), functional limitation (mouth opening distance, Jaw Functional Limitation Scale; JFLS) and mechanical sensitization (pressure pain thresholds; PPTs) on Days 0, 2 and 5 and completed twice daily electronic pain dairies from Day 0 to day 30.\n\nResultsPeak pain averaged 2.0/10 (95 % CI: 1.6-2.4) at rest and 4.3/10 (95 % CI: 3.9-4.8) on chewing. Pain-free mouth opening distance reduced from 5.0 cm (95 % CI: 4.8-5.1 cm) on Day 0 to 3.7 cm (95 % CI: 3.5-3.9 cm) on Day 5. The greatest reduction in PPTs was observed over the masseter muscle. Females experienced higher pain, greater functional impairment, and greater sensitivity to mechanical stimuli than males.\n\nConclusionIntramuscular injection of NGF is a useful model with which to explore the mechanisms, and sex differences, present in clinical TMD.",

Previous neuroimaging work suggests that the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the fronto-temporal language network may be involved in representing number words. However, the contribution of early-developing numerosity representations to the acquisition of counting has not been tested in children. If regions that support numerosity processing are important for the acquisition of counting, then there should be functional overlap between numerosity representations and number word representations in the brain, before children have mastered counting. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we identified numerosity processing regions in 3- to 5-year-old children during a numerosity comparison task. To identify neural representations of number words, we measured changes in neural amplitudes while those same children listened to number words and color words and while they listened to counting and alphabet sequences. Across multiple whole-brain analyses, we found that the bilateral IPS consistently supported representations of numerosities, number words, and counting sequences. Functional overlap between numerosities and unknown counting sequences was also evident in the left IFG, and in some cases number word representations emerged in the left hemisphere fronto-temporal language network. These results provide new evidence from children that primitive numerosity processing regions of the brain interface with the language network to ground the acquisition of verbal counting.\n\nHighlightsO_LIfMRI data revealed the neural basis of counting acquisition in 3- to 5-year-olds.\nC_LIO_LIOverlap between neural responses to count words and numerosity emerged in the IPS.\nC_LIO_LISensitivity to number words emerged in the IPS across two different tasks.\nC_LIO_LINumber word stimuli also engaged regions of the language network in children.\nC_LIO_LIThe IPS and language network may ground number words during counting acquisition.\nC_LI",

The microbial communities found within and around these structures can be referred to as the cyanosphere, and can enable collective metabolic activities relevant to biogeochemical cycles. Cyanosphere communities are suggested to have different composition to that in the surrounding environment, but studies to date are mostly based on single time point samples. Here, we retrieved samples containing cyanobacterial granules from a freshwater reservoir and maintained a culture through sub-culture passages under laboratory conditions for over a year. We show that cyanobacteria-dominated granules form readily and repeatedly in this system over passages, and that this structure formation process seems to be associated with cyanobacterial motility. Performing longitudinal short-read sequencing over several culture passages, we identified a cyanosphere community comprising of 17 species with maintained population structure. Using long-read sequencing from two different time point samples, we have re-constructed full, circular genomes for 15 of these species and annotated metabolic functions within. This predicts several metabolic interactions among community members, including sulfur cycling and carbon and vitamin exchange. Using three individual species isolated from this cyanosphere, we provide experimental support for growth on carbon sources predicted to be secreted by the cyanobacterium in the system. These findings reinforce the view that the cyanosphere can recruit and maintain a specific microbial community with specific functionalities embedded in a spatially-organised microenvironment. The presented community will act as a key model system for further understanding the formation of the structured cyanosphere, its function and stability, and its metabolic contribution to biogeochemical cycles.",

    "abstract": "Diverse aerobic bacteria use atmospheric hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) as energy sources to support growth and survival. Though recently discovered, trace gas oxidation is now recognised as a globally significant process that serves as the main sink in the biogeochemical H2 cycle and sustains microbial biodiversity in oligotrophic ecosystems. While trace gas oxidation has been reported in nine phyla of bacteria, it was not known whether archaea also use atmospheric H2. Here we show that a thermoacidophilic archaeon, Acidianus brierleyi (Thermoproteota), constitutively consumes H2 and CO to sub-atmospheric levels. Oxidation occurred during both growth and survival across a wide range of temperatures (10 to 70{degrees}C). Genomic analysis demonstrated that A. brierleyi encodes a canonical carbon monoxide dehydrogenase and, unexpectedly, four distinct [NiFe]-hydrogenases from subgroups not known to mediate aerobic H2 uptake. Quantitative proteomic analyses showed that A. brierleyi differentially produced these enzymes in response to electron donor and acceptor availability. A previously unidentified group 1 [NiFe]-hydrogenase, with a unique genetic arrangement, is constitutively expressed and upregulated during stationary phase and aerobic hydrogenotrophic growth. Another archaeon, Metallosphaera sedula, was also found to oxidize atmospheric H2. These results suggest that trace gas oxidation is a common trait of aerobic archaea, which likely plays a role in their survival and niche expansion, including during dispersal through temperate environments. These findings also demonstrate that atmospheric H2 consumption is a cross-domain phenomenon, suggesting an ancient origin of this trait, and identify previously unknown microbial and enzymatic sinks of atmospheric H2 and CO.",

    "abstract": "In the standard toolkit for recombinant protein expression, the yeast known in biotechnology as Pichia pastoris (formally: Komagataella phaffii) takes up the position between E. coli and HEK293 or CHO mammalian cells, and is used by thousands of laboratories both in academia and industry. The organism is eukaryotic yet microbial, and grows to extremely high cell densities while secreting proteins into its fully defined growth medium, using very well established strong inducible or constitutive promoters. Many products made in Pichia are in the clinic and in industrial markets. Pichia is also a favoured host for the rapidly emerging area of  precision fermentation for the manufacturing of food proteins. However, the earliest steps in the development of the industrial strain (NRRL Y-11430/CBS 7435) that is used throughout the world were performed prior to 1985 in industry (Phillips Petroleum Company) and are not in the public domain. Moreover, despite the long expiry of associated patents, the patent deposit NRRL Y-11430/CBS 7435 that is the parent to all commonly used industrial strains, is not or no longer made freely available through the resp. culture collections. This situation is far from ideal for what is a major chassis for synthetic biology, as it generates concern that novel applications of the system are still encumbered by licensing requirements of the very basic strains. In the spirit of open science and freedom to operate for what is a key component of biotechnology, we set out to resolve this by using genome sequencing of type strains, reverse engineering where necessary, and comparative protein expression and strain characterisation studies. We find that the industrial strains derive from the K. phaffii type strain lineage deposited as 54-11.239 in the UC Davis Phaff Yeast Strain collection by Herman Phaff in 1954. This type strain has valid equivalent deposits that are replicated/derived from it in other yeast strain collections, incl. in ARS-NRRL NRRL YB-4290 (deposit also made by Herman Phaff) and NRRL Y-7556, CBS 2612 and NCYC 2543. We furthermore discovered that NRRL Y-11430 and its derivatives carry an ORF-truncating mutation in the HOC1 cell wall synthesis gene, and that reverse engineering of a similar mutation in the NCYC 2543 type strain imparts the high transformability that is characteristic of the industrial strains. Uniquely, the NCYC 2543 type strain, which we propose to call  OPENPichia henceforth, is freely available from the NCYC culture collection, incl. resale and commercial production licenses at nominal annual licensing fees1. Furthermore, our not-for-profit research institute VIB has also acquired a resale/distribution license from NCYC, which we presently use to openly provide to end-users our genome-sequenced OPENPichia subclone strain and its derivatives, i.e., currently the highly transformable hoc1tr and the his4 auxotrophic mutants. To complement the OPENPichia platform, a fully synthetic modular gene expression vector building toolkit was developed, which is also openly distributed, for any purpose. We invite other researchers to contribute to our open science resource-building effort to establish a new unencumbered standard chassis for Pichia synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "Protein homeostasis involves the ubiquitously expressed heterodimeric protein NAC (ribosome associated nascent polypeptide complex), consisting of - and {beta}-subunits. We previously found in Drosophila melanogaster the presence of germline-specific paralogous genes for NAC subunits (gNACs): unique for the -subunit and several highly homologous amplified genes for the {beta}-subunit, indistinguishable by the antibodies used, while they were detected as different phosphorylated isoforms in 2D electrophoresis with immunostaining. The distinct increase in gNAC expression in growing spermatocytes compared with their predecessors, gonioblasts, is accompanied by a clear presence of gNAC in the cytoplasm of dividing meiotic cells and spermatids. In oogenesis, gNAC expression is significantly lower than in the testis, but gNAC accumulation is found at the posterior pole of the mature oocyte, known as the germplasm region responsible for the germ cell formation in the offspring. gNAC-associated ribosomes from mature oocytes are enriched in mRNA sets encoding known germplasm and centrosome proteins. gNAC is also detected in a pericentriolar component of centrosomes: in syncytial dividing nuclei in the early embryos, in primordial germ cells and spermatocytes, including meiotic divisions stage. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deficiency of the gNAC-alpha subunit causes female infertility. We propose the role of the gNAC phosphoregulatory paralog system as a component of the germline proteostasis network, coordinated with the centrosome functions. Here, we also extended our results by identifying cross-links between ubiquitous and germline-specific NAC-{beta} paralogs, finding an additional case of functional cross-talk between heterodimeric ubNAC and gNAC -subunit paralogs, which may maintain the robustness of proteostasis and fly fecundity.",

Here, we established an Affinity-linker based super-sensitive auxin-inducible degron (AlissAID) system in budding yeast by using a single domain antibody (a nanobody). In this system, target proteins fused with GFP or mCherry were degraded depending on a synthetic auxin, 5-Adamantyl-IAA (5-Ad-IAA). In AlissAID system, nanomolar concentration of 5-Ad-IAA induces target degradation, thus minimizing the side effects from chemical compounds. In addition, in AlissAID system, we observed few basal degradations which was observed in other AID systems including ssAID system. Furthermore, AlissAID based conditional knockdown cell lines are easily generated by using budding yeast GFP Clone Collection. From these advantages, the AlissAID system would be an ideal protein-knockdown system in budding yeast cells.",

Despite widespread testing of Prime editing, it is currently only compatible with type II CRISPR/Cas proteins such as Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus Cas9. Enabling RT compatibility with other CRISPR/Cas domains, such as type V enzymes with orthogonal protospacer adjacent motif specificities and smaller protein size would expand the range of edits that can be made in therapeutic and industrial applications. We achieve this with a novel mode of DNA editing at CRISPR-targeted sites that reverse transcribes the edit into the target strand DNA (e.g., the complement of the PAM-containing strand), rather than the non-target strand DNA, as in Prime editing. We term this technology RNA encoded DNA replacement of alleles with CRISPR (hereafter, REDRAW). We show that REDRAW extends the utility of RT-mediated editing beyond type II to include multiple type V CRISPR domains. REDRAW features a broad (8-10 bases) targeting window, at which all types of substitutions, insertions and deletions are possible. REDRAW combines the advantages of type V CRISPR domains with the extensive range of genetic variation enabled by RT-mediated, templated sequence replacement strategies.",

Here, we develop an optimised cytosine base editing system for gene inactivation in Drosophila through predictable C-to-T editing and identify temperature as a crucial parameter for base editing efficiency. We find that activity of an evolved version of the most widely used APOBEC1 deaminase is attenuated within the temperature range commonly used for culturing Drosophila (18-29{degrees}C) and many other ectothermic species. In contrast, an evolved CDA1 domain functions with remarkable efficiency within the same temperature range. Furthermore, we show that formation of undesired indel mutations and C-to-G/A edits is exceptionally rare in Drosophila compared to other species. The predictable editing outcome, very high efficiency and minimal byproduct formation of this system allows for near homogeneous biallelic gene inactivation in vivo in a ubiquitous or conditional manner. This work significantly improves our ability to create precise loss-of-function alleles in Drosophila and provides key design parameters for developing highly efficient base editing systems in other ectothermic species.",

    "abstract": "Many predators avoid unprofitable prey by learning to use visual features of the prey as reliable indicators of quality. Despite a rich literature on avoidance learning, we are still in the process of understanding how individuals might change their behavior towards unprofitable prey as information accumulates, the individual-level variation in avoidance foraging behavior, and whether learning would preserve or reduce this variation. In this study, we investigated how avoidance foraging behavior varied in a generalist lizard predator in relation to sex, population of origin, and boldness and tested the effects of learning on the variation in avoidance foraging behavior. We collected data on boldness and avoidance foraging behavior in individuals from two allopatric populations and compared variation in behavior at the beginning and end of learning experiments, in which individuals were presented with normal- and bitter-tasting prey that also differed consistently in color. We found that even though bitter prey elicited strong negative responses, lizards overall did not avoid consuming fewer such prey with learning. Instead, lizards learned to prioritize on palatable prey as they acquired more information. Our data revealed intricate covariation between boldness and avoidance foraging behavior, and the form of this covariation varied between populations, sex, and prey color. Learning overall reduced individual variation in foraging behavior, as well as the degree of covariation with boldness. Our findings highlighted the nuanced manners in which avoidance foraging behavior might manifest and suggested that learning could quickly mitigate fitness difference due to variation in behavior.\n\nLay SummaryPredators can learn to avoid unprofitable prey using certain visual cues or signals, but avoidance foraging behavior can manifest in more subtle ways than simply \"to eat or not to eat\". We reported changes in foraging sequence and priority in a generalist lizard predator after learning and found that the nature of these changes depended on sex, population of origin, boldness, and prey color. We also found that learning made individuals more similar in behavior.",

Here, we characterize binding of the RBM5 RRM1-ZnF1-RRM2 domains to cis-regulatory RNA elements. A structure of the RRM1-ZnF1 region in complex with RNA shows how the tandem domains cooperate to sandwich target RNA and specifically recognize a GG dinucleotide in a non-canonical fashion. While the RRM1-ZnF1 domains act as a single structural module, RRM2 is connected by a flexible linker and tumbles independently.

    "abstract": "The VanRS two-component system regulates the resistance phenotype of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). VanS is a sensor histidine kinase that responds to the presence of vancomycin by autophosphorylating and subsequently transferring the phosphoryl group to the response regulator, VanR. The phosphotransfer activates VanR as a transcription factor, which initiates the expression of resistance genes. Structural information about VanS proteins has remained elusive, hindering the molecular-level understanding of their function. Here, we present X-ray crystal structures for the catalytic and ATP-binding (CA) domains of two VanS proteins, derived from VRE types A and C. Both proteins adopt the canonical Bergerat fold that has been observed for CA domains of other prokaryotic histidine kinases. We attempted to determine structures for the nucleotide-bound forms of both proteins; however, despite repeated efforts, these forms could not be crystallized, prompting us to measure the proteins binding affinities for ATP. Unexpectedly, both CA domains displayed low affinities for the nucleotide, with KD values in the low millimolar range. Since these KD values are comparable to intracellular ATP concentrations, this weak substrate binding could reflect a way of regulating expression of the resistance phenotype.",

This screen revealed information regarding the structure-activity relationship of ubonodin over a large sequence space, indicating certain residues that can tolerate amino acid substitutions and still retain activity. Remarkably, the screen identified one variant with not only improved activity compared to wild-type ubonodin but also a sub-micromolar minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against a clinical isolate of the Bcc member Burkholderia cenocepacia. Ubonodin and several of the variants identified in this study had a lower MIC against certain Bcc strains than many clinically approved antibiotics.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 emerged in December 2019 and quickly spread worldwide, continuously striking with an unpredictable evolution. Despite the success in vaccine production and mass vaccination programmes, the situation is not still completely controlled, and therefore accessible second-generation vaccines are required to mitigate the pandemic. We previously developed an adjuvanted vaccine candidate coded PHH-1V, based on a heterodimer fusion protein comprising the RBD domain of two SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here, we report data on the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of PHH-1V in cynomolgus macaques. PHH-1V prime-boost vaccination induces high levels of RBD-specific IgG binding and neutralising antibodies against several SARS-CoV-2 variants, as well as a balanced Th1/Th2 cellular immune response. Remarkably, PHH-1V vaccination prevents SARS-CoV-2 replication in the lower respiratory tract and significantly reduces viral load in the upper respiratory tract after an experimental infection. These results highlight the potential use of the PHH-1V vaccine in humans, currently undergoing Phase III clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "In swine husbandry, weaning is a critical event for piglets which causes environmental, nutritional, and psychological stresses, with consequences such as intestinal dysbiosis. To counteract this issue, producers resorted to the use of in-feed antimicrobials to prevent post-weaning diarrhea and to promote growth for increased animal performance. However, the use of antibiotic for growth promotion was banned in many countries. In-feed supplements have great potential as alternative strategies. This study evaluated the effect on gut microbial activity, microbiome, and animal performance of combinations of peri-weaning feeding strategies such as bovine colostrum, medium-chain fatty acids and yeast extract. We quantified weight gain, intestinal pH, volatile fatty acids, and characterized the gut microbiota on ileum, cecum, and colon digestates. Overall, the feed supplements had limited impact on weight gain and volatile fatty acids production. However, the combined treatments have demonstrated a modulatory effect on gut microbiota which supports a potential role as an alternative to growth-promoting antibiotic in the swine industry.",

    "abstract": "Humans with metabolic and inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis harbor dysbiotic gut communities. However, the microbes and microbial pathways that influence disease progression remain largely undefined. Here, we show that variation in atherosclerosis burden is in part driven by the gut microbiota and it is associated with circulating levels of the proinflammatory molecule uric acid both in mice and humans. We identify bacterial taxa present in the gut spanning multiple phyla, including Bacillota (Firmicutes), Fusobacteriota and Pseudomonadota (Proteobacteria), that use uric acid and adenine- a key precursor of nucleic acids in intestinal cells, as carbon and energy sources anaerobically, and uncover a gene cluster encoding key steps of purine degradation that is widely distributed among gut dwelling bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate that colonization of germ-free mice with purine-degrading bacteria modulates levels of uric acid and other purines in the gut and systemically. Altogether this work demonstrates that gut microbes are important drivers of host global purine homeostasis and uric acid levels, and suggests that gut bacterial catabolism of purines may represent a novel mechanism by which the gut microbiome influences host health.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus mitis is a normal member of the human oral microbiota and a leading opportunistic pathogen causing infective endocarditis (IE). Despite the complex interactions between S. mitis and human host, understanding of S. mitis physiology, as well as its mechanisms of adaptation to host-associated environments, is inadequate, especially when compared with other IE bacterial pathogens. This study reports growth-promoting effects of human serum on S. mitis and other pathogenic streptococci, including S. oralis, S. pneumoniae, and S. agalactiae. Using transcriptomic analyses we identified that, with the addition of human serum, S. mitis down-regulates uptake systems for metal ions and sugars, fatty acid biosynthetic genes, and genes involved in stress response and other processes related with growth and replication. S. mitis up-regulates uptake systems for amino acids and short peptides in response to human serum. Zinc availability and environmental signals sensed by the induced short peptide binding proteins were not sufficient to confer the seen growth-promoting effects. More investigation is required to establish the mechanism for growth promotion. Overall, our study contributes to the fundamental understanding of S. mitis physiology under host-associated conditions.\n\nSignificanceS. mitis is exposed to human serum components during commensalism in the human mouth and bloodstream pathogenesis. However, the physiological effects of serum components on this bacterium remain unclear. Using transcriptomic analyses, S. mitis biological processes that respond to the presence of human serum were revealed, providing the fundamental understanding of S. mitis adaptations towards human host conditions.",

    "abstract": "SummaryPalmitoylation of cysteine residues at the C-terminal hypervariable regions in human HRAS and NRAS, which is necessary for the RAS signaling, is catalyzed by the acyltransferase DHHC9 in complex with its accessory protein GCP16. The molecular basis for the acyltransferase activity and the regulation of DHHC9 by GCP16 is not clear. Here we report the cryo-EM structures of the human DHHC9-GCP16 complex and its yeast counterpart -- the Erf2-Erf4 complex, demonstrating that GCP16 and Erf4 are not directly involved in the catalytic process but stabilize the architecture of DHHC9 and Erf2, respectively. We found that a phospholipid binding to an arginine-rich region of DHHC9 and palmitoylation on three residues (C24, C25, and C288) were essential for the catalytic activity of the DHHC9-GCP16 complex. Furthermore, we showed that GCP16 also formed complexes with DHHC14 and 18 to catalyze RAS palmitoylation. These findings provide insights into the regulation mechanism of RAS palmitoyltransferases.",

    "abstract": "Bio-computation is the implementation of computational operations using biological substrates, such as cells engineered with synthetic genetic circuits. These genetic circuits can be composed of DNA parts with specific functions, such as promoters that initiate transcription, ribosome binding sites that initiate translation, and coding sequences that are translated into proteins. Compositions of such parts can encode genetic circuits in which the proteins produced by genes regulate each other in different ways. The expression level of each gene may be considered as a signal which may be high or low, encoding binary logic, and the combinations of genes can then encode logic circuits. This is equivalent to the level-based logic used in modern electronic computers in which the voltage forms the logical high or low states.\n\nA different approach to binary logic is to encode the high and low states in the phase of an oscillating signal. In this approach a signal in phase with a reference represents high, and a signal antiphase with the reference represents the logical low state. We present here designs and models for phase-based genetic NOT, OR, AND, MAJORITY and complementary MAJORITY gates, which together form multiple complete logical sets. We derive analytical expressions for the optimal model parameters for circuit function. Our simulation results suggest that this approach to genetic logic is feasible and could be less sensitive to gate input-output mismatch than level-based genetic logic. To demonstrate the scaleability of phase-based genetic logic, we used our complementary MAJORITY and NOT gates to design and simulate a fully functional 4-bit ripple adder circuit, and showed that it was robust to molecular noise.",

    "abstract": "Spiders minor ampullate silk, or MI-silk, exhibits distinct mechanical properties and water resistance compared to its major ampullate counterpart (MA-silk). The principal protein constituent of MI-silk is known as minor ampullate spidroin, or MiSp, and while its sequence has been deciphered and is thought to underlie the differences in properties with MA-silk, the composition of MI-silk and the relationship between its composition and properties remain elusive. In this study, we set out to investigate the mechanical properties, water resistance, and proteome of MA-silk and MI-silk from Araneus ventricosus and Trichonephila clavata. We also synthesized artificial fibers from major ampullate spidroin, MaSp1 and 2, and MiSp to compare their properties. Our proteomic analysis reveals that the MI-silk of both araneids is composed of MiSp, MaSp1, and spidroin constituting elements (SpiCEs). The absence of MaSp2 in the MI-silk proteome and the comparison of the water resistance of artificial fibers suggest that the presence of MaSp2 is the reason for the disparity in water resistance between MI-silk and MA-silk.",

    "abstract": "Despite the vaccination campaigns for COVID-19, we still cannot control the spread of SARS-CoV-2, as evidenced by the ongoing circulation of the Omicron variants of concern. This highlights the need for broad-spectrum antivirals to further combat COVID-19 and to be prepared for a new pandemic with a (re-)emerging coronavirus. An interesting target for antiviral drug development is the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, a crucial early step in the replication cycle of enveloped viruses. In this study, we explored the use of cellular electrical impedance (CEI) to quantitatively monitor morphological changes in real time, resulting from cell-cell fusion elicited by SARS-CoV-2 spike. The impedance signal in CEI-quantified cell-cell fusion correlated with the expression level of SARS-CoV-2 spike in transfected HEK293T cells. For antiviral assessment, we validated the CEI assay with the fusion inhibitor EK1 and measured a concentration-dependent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 spike mediated cell-cell fusion (IC50 value of 0.13 M). In addition, CEI was used to confirm the fusion inhibitory activity of the carbohydrate-binding plant lectin UDA against SARS-CoV-2 (IC50 value of 0.55 M), which complements prior in-house profiling activities. Finally, we explored the utility of CEI in quantifying the fusogenic potential of mutant spike proteins and in comparing the fusion efficiency of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. In summary, we demonstrate that CEI is a powerful and sensitive technology that can be applied to studying the fusion process of SARS-CoV-2 and to screening and characterizing fusion inhibitors in a label-free and non-invasive manner.\n\nImportanceDespite the success of the vaccines against SARS-CoV-2, new variants of the virus are still emerging and spreading, underlining the need for additional effective antiviral countermeasures. An interesting antiviral target for enveloped viruses is the fusion of the viral envelope with host cell membranes, a crucial early step in the life cycle of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2. Here, we present a sensitive impedance-based method to monitor in real-time cell-cell fusion elicited by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. With this technique we can profile entry inhibitors and determine the inhibitory potential of fusion inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2. In addition, with cellular electrical impedance we can evaluate the fusogenic properties of new emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Overall, the impedance technology adds valuable information on the fusion process of circulating coronaviruses and helps unravel the mode of action of new antivirals, opening new avenues for the development of next generation fusion inhibitors with improved antiviral activity.",
