    "abstract": "Cachexia is a life-threatening disease characterized by chronic, inflammatory muscle wasting and systemic metabolic impairment. Despite its high prevalence, there are no efficacious therapies for cachexia. Mice chronically infected with the protozoan parasite Toxoplasma gondii represent a novel animal model recapitulating the chronic kinetics of cachexia. To understand how perturbations to metabolic tissue homeostasis influence circulating metabolite availability we used mass spectrometry analysis. Despite the significant reduction in circulating triacylglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, and glycerol, sphingolipid long-chain bases and a subset of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) were significantly increased in the sera of mice with T. gondii infection-induced cachexia. In addition, the TCA cycle intermediates -ketoglutarate, 2-hydroxyglutarate, succinate, fumarate, and malate were highly depleted in cachectic mouse sera. Sphingolipids and their de novo synthesis precursors PCs are the major components of the mitochondrial membrane and regulate mitochondrial function consistent with a causal relationship in the energy imbalance driving T. gondii-induced chronic cachexia.",

    "abstract": "Aposematic signals advertise underlying defences in many species. They should be detectable (highly contrasting against the background) and bold (high internal pattern contrast) to enhance predator recognition, learning and memorisation. However, the signalling function of aposematic colour patterns may be distance-dependent: signals may be undetectable from a distance to reduce costs of increased attacks from naive predators but bold when viewed up close. To test this hypothesis, we quantified the chromatic and achromatic detectability and boldness of colour patterns in 13 nudibranch species that varied in the strength of their chemical defences, in terms of unpalatability and toxicity, using Quantitative Colour Pattern Analysis (QCPA) and data on the visual perception of a triggerfish (Rhinecanthus aculeatus). When viewed from larger distances, there were no differences in detectability and boldness between well-defended and undefended species. However, when viewed at close distances, well-defended species were more detectable and bolder than undefended species. The detectability of defended species decreased more significantly with increased viewing distances compared to boldness but remained relatively consistent over viewing distances for undefended species. We provide evidence for distance-dependent signalling in aposematic nudibranchs and highlight the importance of distinguishing between signal detectability and boldness in studies of aposematism.",

Deep learning models that learn complex sequence rules provide an unprecedented opportunity to dissect this problem. Using zygotic genome activation in the Drosophila embryo as a model, we generated high-resolution TF binding and chromatin accessibility data, analyzed the data with interpretable deep learning, and performed genetic experiments for validation. We uncover a clear hierarchical relationship between the pioneer TF Zelda and the TFs involved in axis patterning. Zelda consistently pioneers chromatin accessibility proportional to motif affinity, while patterning TFs augment chromatin accessibility in sequence contexts in which they mediate enhancer activation. We conclude that chromatin accessibility occurs in two phases: one through pioneering, which makes enhancers accessible but not necessarily active, and a second when the correct combination of transcription factors leads to enhancer activation.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence is a critical developmental period, concerning anatomical, neurochemical and behavioral changes. Moreover, adolescents are more sensitive to the long-term deleterious effects of drug abuse. Binge-like consumption of alcohol and marijuana, along with tobacco smoking, is a dangerous pattern often observed in adolescents during weekends. Nevertheless, the long-term effect of their adolescent co-exposure has not been experimentally investigated yet.\n\nLong-Evans adolescent male (n = 20) and female (n = 20) rats from postnatal day 30 (P30) until P60 were daily treated with nicotine (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.), and, on two consecutive  binging days per week (for a total of eight times), received an intragastric ethanol solution (3 g/kg) and an intraperitoneal (i.p.) dose of cannabinoid 1/2 receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 (1.2 mg/kg). These rats were tested after treatment discontinuation at >P90 for associative food-rewarded operant learning in the two-lever conditioning chambers for six consecutive days on a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule followed by another six days of daily FR2 schedule testing, after 45 days rest. We found the main effects of sex x treatment interactions in FR1 but not in FR2 experiments. Treated females show attenuated operant responses for food pellets during all FR1 and the FR2 schedule, whilst the treated males show an impairment in FR2 but not in the FR1 schedule. Moreover, the treated females percentage of learners was significantly lower than female controls in FR1 while treated males and females were lower than controls in FR2.\n\nOur findings suggest that intermittent adolescent abuse of common drugs, such as alcohol and marijuana, and chronic tobacco exposure can cause significant long-term effects on motivation for natural reinforcers later in adulthood in both sexes. Females appear to be more sensitive to the deleterious effects of adolescent polydrug abuse with both sexes having an increased likelihood of developing lifelong brain alterations.",

Efficacy was demonstrated in vitro against SARS-CoV-2 and HIV-1 and was nearly identical to that of GRFT expressed in vivo. The proposed production process is efficient and can be readily scaled up and deployed anywhere in the world where a viral pathogen might emerge. The current emergence of viral variants has resulted in frequent updating of existing vaccines and loss of efficacy for front-line monoclonal antibody therapies.

Their mechanical properties are mainly due to their stiff cell wall which also constitutes a physical barrier between the cell and its environment. Thus, it is essential to be able to quantify the cell wall mechanical properties and their adaptation to environmental cues. Here, we present a technique we developed to measure the Youngs (elastic) modulus of the root hair cell wall. In essence, using custom-made glass microplates as cantilevers of calibrated stiffness, we are able to measure the force necessary to bend a single living root hair.

PIP2 regulates the activity of many membrane proteins, while IP3 and DAG lead to increased intracellular Ca2+ levels and activate PKC, respectively. PLC{beta}s are regulated by GPCRs through direct interaction with Gq and G{beta}{gamma}. This study addresses the mechanism by which G{beta}{gamma} activates PLC{beta}3. We show that PLC{beta}3 functions as a slow Michaelis-Menten enzyme (kcat~2 sec-1, KM~0.43 mol%) on membrane surfaces. Its partition coefficient (Kx~2.9 * 104) is such that only a small quantity of PLC{beta}3 exists in the membrane in the absence of G{beta}{gamma}. When G{beta}{gamma} is present, equilibrium binding (Keq~0.009 mol%) increases PLC{beta}3 in the membrane, increasing Vmax in proportion. Atomic structures on membrane vesicle surfaces show that two G{beta}{gamma} anchor PLC{beta}3 with its catalytic site oriented toward the membrane surface. This principle of activation explains rapid stimulated catalysis with low background catalysis.",

    "abstract": "Jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene (ET) and salicylic acid (SA) are the three major phytohormones coordinating a plants defense response to pathogenic attack. While JA and ET are assumed to primarily control the defense against necrotrophic pathogens, SA-induced defense responses target mainly biotrophic microbes, and can include drastic measures such as programmed cell death as part of the plants hypersensitive response (HR). Fusarium oxysporum is a hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen of several plant species, including many important food crops, and the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana. Colonization of the plants root vascular tissue by the fungus eventually results in wilting and plant death. A general role for JA, ET and SA in combating infection and colonization of the plant by F. oxysporum has been demonstrated, but their distinct roles and modes of action have so far not been described. Here, using high resolution microscopy with fluorescent marker lines of A. thaliana roots infected with F. oxysporum we show that SA acts spatially separate from JA, in a distinct set of root cells immediately neighboring the fungal colonization site. There, SA induces HR to stop the spread of colonization. JA acts in a different, but also clearly defined set of cells, slightly removed from the colonization site, where it initiates a defense response to actively resist the invader. ET is activated in a stretch of cells that covers both, the cells with activated SA and JA signaling, and may be involved in creating these two distinct zones. These results show how the three phytohormones act together, but spatially and functionally separate from each other, to fight this hemibiotrophic pathogen. Such a high-resolution analysis to resolve the plants immune response to pathogenic infection on an individual cell level and in intact tissue has so far been lacking.\n\nGraphical AbstractO_LIColonization of the A. thaliana root tip by F. oxysporum strain Fo5176 leads to immediate cell death of the colonized and surrounding tissue.\nC_LIO_LIAs the colonization front progresses through the vasculature, the cell death front moves along with it through not only the vasculature, but also the surrounding tissues.\nC_LIO_LIWRKY70 positively regulates salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis in cells immediately adjacent to the colonized tissue, inducing a hypersensitive response (HR), thereby killing off the cells deemed lost to the intruder, establishing the cell death front.\nC_LIO_LISlightly further removed from the HR zone, WRKY11 induces jasmonate (JA) biosynthesis in cells of the vasculature to launch a defense response aimed at actively repelling the fungus.\nC_LI\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521292v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (50K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bd280forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@191052aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea43acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100ecdb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Aging is due to a complex decline of multiple biological processes. Some of the causes include oxidative damage, mitochondrial and proteostatic dysfunction, and DNA damage. The result is that as biological systems age their performance deteriorates. This age-related decline is well quantified, and experienced, for human hearing and is presumed to be due to a decrease in the ears metabolism - specifically a decrease in ability to maintain an electrochemical gradient, the endocochlear potential. However, direct measurements of metabolism across a lifespan in an auditory system are lacking. Even if metabolism does decrease with age, the question remains is it a cause of age-related auditory decline or simply correlative? All auditory systems across the animal kingdom share functional principles including ion pumping cells, auditory receptors, spiking auditory nerves and multiple supporting cells. Therefore, we used an insect, the desert locust, Schistocerca gregaria, as a physiologically versatile model to understand how cellular metabolism correlates with age and impacts on age-related auditory decline. We found that although metabolism correlates with age-related auditory decline it is not causative.",

These effects have been observed in different sensory domains using various stimulus types, but little attention has been given to their similarity or distinctiveness and the underlying processes they may share. Here, a data-driven approach was taken to investigate the temporal evolution of shared information content between different memory conditions using openly available EEG data from healthy human participants of both sexes, taken from six experiments. A test dataset involving personally highly familiar and unfamiliar faces was used. The results show that neural signals of recognition memory for face stimuli were highly generalized starting from around 200 ms following stimulus onset. When training was performed on non-face datasets, an early (around 200-300 ms) to late (post-400 ms) differentiation was observed over most regions of interest. Successful cross-classification for non-face stimuli (music and object/scene associations) was most pronounced in late period. Additionally, a striking dissociation was observed between familiar and remembered objects, with shared signals present only in the late window for correctly remembered objects, while cross-classification for familiar objects was successful in the early period as well. These findings suggest that late neural signals of memory retrieval generalize across sensory modalities and stimulus types, and the dissociation between familiar and remembered objects may provide insight into the underlying processes.",

    "abstract": "Everyday experience requires processing external signals from the world around us and internal information retrieved from memory. To do both, the brain must fluctuate between states that are optimized for external vs. internal attention. Here, we focus on the hippocampus as a region that may serve at the interface between these forms of attention, and ask how it switches between prioritizing sensory signals from the external world vs. internal signals related to memories and thoughts. Pharmacological, computational, and animal studies have identified input from the cholinergic basal forebrain as important for biasing the hippocampus towards processing external information, whereas complementary research suggests the dorsal attention network (DAN) may aid in allocating attentional resources towards accessing internal information. We therefore tested the hypothesis that the basal forebrain and DAN drive the hippocampus towards external and internal attention, respectively. We used data from 29 human participants (17 female) who completed 2 attention tasks during fMRI. One task (\"memory-guided\") required proportionally more internal attention, and proportionally less external attention, than the other (\"explicitly instructed\"). We discovered that background functional connectivity between the basal forebrain and hippocampus was stronger during the explicitly instructed vs. memory-guided task. In contrast, DAN-hippocampus background connectivity was stronger during the memory-guided vs. explicitly instructed task. Finally, the strength of DAN-hippocampus background connectivity was correlated with performance on the memory-guided but not explicitly instructed task. Together, these results provide evidence that the basal forebrain and DAN may modulate the hippocampus to switch between external and internal attention.\n\nSignificance StatementHow does the brain balance the need to pay attention to internal thoughts and external sensations? We focused on the human hippocampus, a region that may serve at the interface between internal and external attention, and asked how its functional connectivity varies based on attentional states. The hippocampus was more strongly coupled with the cholinergic basal forebrain when attentional states were guided by the external world rather than retrieved memories. This pattern flipped for functional connectivity between the hippocampus and dorsal attention network, which was higher for attention tasks that were guided by memory rather than external cues. Together, these findings show that distinct networks in the brain may modulate the hippocampus to switch between external and internal attention.",

    "abstract": "The behavioral state of an animal has profound effects on neuronal information processing. Locomotion changes the response properties of visual interneurons in the insect brain, but it is still unknown if it also alters the response properties of photoreceptors. Photoreceptor responses become faster at higher temperatures. It has therefore been suggested that thermoregulation in bees and other insects could improve temporal resolution in vision, but direct evidence for this idea has so far been missing. Here we compared electroretinograms (ERGs) from the compound eyes of tethered bumblebees that were either sitting still or were walking on an air supported ball. We found that the visual processing speed strongly increased when the bumblebees were walking. By monitoring the bumblebees eye temperature during our recordings, we saw that the increase in response speed was in synchrony with a rise of the eye temperature. By artificially heating the bees head, we show that the walking induced temperature increase of the visual system is sufficient to explain the rise in processing speed. We also show that walking accelerates the visual system to the equivalent of a 14-fold increase in light intensity. We conclude that the walking-induced rise in temperature accelerates the processing of visual information in bumblebees, which is an ideal strategy to process the increased information flow during locomotion.",

    "abstract": "One of the most proliferative periods for T cells occurs during their development in the thymus. Increased DNA replication can result in increased DNA mutations in the nuclear genome, but also in mitochondrial genomes. A high frequency of mitochondrial DNA mutations can lead to abnormal mitochondrial function and have negative implications on human health. Furthermore, aging is accompanied by an increase in such mutations through oxidative damage and replication errors. Increased mitochondrial DNA mutations cause loss of mitochondrial protein function, and decrease energy production, substrates, and metabolites. Here we have evaluated the effect of increased mitochondrial DNA mutations on T cell development in the thymus. Using mice carrying a mutant mitochondrial DNA polymerase {gamma} (PolG) that causes increased mitochondrial DNA mutations, we show that high fidelity replication of mitochondrial DNA is pivotal for proper T cell development. Reducing the fidelity of mitochondrial DNA replication results in a premature age-dependent reduction in the total number of CD4/CD8 double negative and double positive thymocytes. Analysis of mitochondrial density in thymocyte subpopulations suggests that this may be due to reduced proliferation in specific double negative stages. Taken together, this work suggests that T cell development is regulated by the ability of mitochondria to faithfully replicate their DNA.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMechanisms for Helicobacter pylori (Hp)-driven stomach cancer are not fully understood. In a transgenic mouse model of gastric preneoplasia, concomitant Hp infection and induction of constitutively active KRAS (Hp+KRAS+) alters metaplasia phenotypes and elicits greater inflammation than either perturbation alone. Gastric single-cell RNA-seq showed that Hp+KRAS+ mice had a large population of metaplastic pit cells that expressed the intestinal mucin Muc4 and the growth factor amphiregulin. Metaplastic pit cells were associated with macrophage and T cell inflammation and prevented by gastric immunosuppression. Lineage tracing showed that Muc4 was not dependent on cell-intrinsic KRAS activity, and lineage-derived cells had a limited propensity for growth as organoids, demonstrating that metaplastic pit cells are largely not self- renewing. Finally, MUC4 expression was significantly associated with proliferation in human gastric cancer samples. These studies identify an Hp-associated metaplastic pit cell lineage, also found in human gastric cancer tissues, whose expansion is driven by Hp-dependent inflammation.\n\nStatement of SignificanceUsing a mouse model, we have delineated metaplastic pit cells as a pre-cancerous cell type whose expansion requires H. pylori-driven inflammation. In humans, metaplastic pit cells show enhanced proliferation as well as enrichment in precancer and early cancer tissues, highlighting an early step in the gastric metaplasia to cancer cascade.",

The current works examines the neural differences between unitization and non-unitized memory using fMRI and multivoxel analyses. Specifically, we examined the differences across face-occupation pairings as a function of whether the pairing was viewed as a person performing the given job (unitized binding) or a person saying they knew someone who had a particular job (non-unitized binding). The results show that at encoding, the angular gyrus can discriminate between unitized and non-unitized target trials. Additionally, during encoding, the medial temporal lobe (hippocampus and perirhinal cortex), frontal parietal regions (angular gyrus and medial frontal gyrus) and visual regions (middle occipital cortex) exhibit distinct neural patterns to recollected unitized and non-unitized targets. Furthermore, the medial frontal gyrus and middle occipital cortex show greater neural similarity for recollected unitized trials than those of recollected non-unitized trials. We conclude that visually unitized pairs may enhance unitization in older adults due to greater similarity of trials within the same condition during the encoding process.",

Social contact and shared space can both increase disease transmission risk, while individual differences in social resources can help prevent infections. For example, high social status individuals and those with more or stronger social relationships may have better immunity and, thus, lower parasitic burden. To test for health trade-offs in the costs and benefits of sociality, we quantified how parasitic load varied with an individuals social status, as well as with their weak and strong affiliative relationships in a free-ranging population of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta). Social resources may also protect against infection under environmentally challenging situations, such as natural disasters. We additionally examined the impact of a major hurricane on the sociality-parasite relationship in this system. We found that both weak and strong proximity partners, but not grooming partners, were associated with lower protozoa infection risk. Social status was not linked to infection risk, even after the hurricane. Overall, our study highlights the buffering against infection that affiliative partners may provide, suggesting individuals can compensate for the health costs of sociality by having partners who tolerate their presence.",

    "abstract": "Ectopic pregnancy (EP) is one of the leading causes of maternal mortality, where the fertilized embryo grows outside of the uterus. Recent experiments on mice have uncovered the importance of genetic factors in the transport of embryos inside the uterus. In the past, efforts have been made to identify possible gene or protein markers in EP in humans through multiple expression studies. Although there exist comprehensive gene resources for other maternal health disorders, there is no specific resource that compiles the genes associated with EP from such expression studies. Here, we address that knowledge gap by creating a computational resource, Ectopic Pregnancy Expression Knowledgebase (EPEK), that involves manual compilation and curation of expression profiles of EP in humans from published articles. In EPEK, we compiled information on 314 differentially expressed genes, 17 metabolites, and 3 SNPs associated with EP. Computational analyses on the gene set from EPEK showed the implication of cellular signaling processes in EP. We also identified possible exosome markers that could be clinically relevant in the diagnosis of EP. In a nutshell, EPEK is the first and only dedicated resource on the expression profile of EP in humans. EPEK is accessible at https://cb.imsc.res.in/epek.",

    "abstract": "Loss of the tumor suppressor protein menin is a critical event underlying the formation of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) in hormone-expressing tissues including gastrinomas. While aberrant expression of menin impairs its tumor suppression, few studies explore the structure- function relationship of clinical Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia, type 1 (MEN1) mutations in the absence of a complete loss of heterozygosity at both loci. Here, we determined whether clinical MEN1 mutations render nuclear menin unstable and lead to its functional inactivation. We studied the structural and functional implications of three clinical MEN1 mutations (R516fs, E235K, and A541T) recently identified in a cohort of ten patients with GEP-NETs. We evaluated the subcellular localization and half-lives of these mutated menin variants in Men1-null mouse embryo fibroblast cells and in hormone-expressing human gastric adenocarcinoma and murine enteroendocrine tumor cell lines. Loss of menin function was assessed by cell proliferation and gastrin gene expression assays. Lastly, we evaluated the effect of the small molecule compound MI-503 on stabilizing nuclear menin expression and function in vitro and in a previously reported mouse model of gastric NET development. Both the R516fs and E235K variants exhibited severe defects in total and subcellular expression of menin, and this was consistent with reduced half-lives of these mutants. Mutated menin variants exhibited loss of function in suppressing tumor cell proliferation and gastrin expression. Treatment with MI-503 rescued nuclear menin expression and attenuated hypergastrinemia and gastric hyperplasia in NET-bearing mice.\n\nImplicationClinically defined germline and somatic MEN1 mutations confer pathogenicity by destabilizing nuclear menin expression.",

We further revealed that RanBPM protein physically interacts with p21, RanBPM deubiquitinates p21 by recruiting a deubiquitinase USP11 to maintain protein stability of p21. Furthermore, RanBPM regulates DNA damage response (DDR) in a p21-dependent manner, and DNA damage promotes the translocation of RanBPM into the nucleus and regulates p21 protein stability through ATM-mediated pathways.

Chronic bacterial infection in CF contributes to the gradual destruction of lung tissue, and eventually respiratory failure in this group.\n\nGap StatementThe contribution of S. aureus to cystic fibrosis (CF) lung decline in the presence or absence of P. aeruginosa is unclear. Defining the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of a range of S. aureus clinical isolates will help further understand its pathogenic capabilities.\n\nAimOur objective was to use molecular and phenotypic tools to characterise twenty-five clinical S. aureus isolates collected from mono- and coinfection with P. aeruginosa from people with CF at the Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne.\n\nMethodologyGenomic DNA was extracted and sequenced. Multilocus sequence typing was used to construct phylogeny from the seven housekeeping genes. A pangenome was calculated using Roary. and cluster of Orthologous groups were assigned using eggNOG-mapper which were used to determine differences within core, accessory, and unique genomes. Characterisation of sequence type, clonal complex, agr and spa types was carried out using PubMLST, eBURST, AgrVATE and spaTyper, respectively. Antibiotic resistance was determined using Kirby Bauer disk diffusion tests. Phenotypic testing of haemolysis was carried out using ovine red blood cell agar plates and mucoid phenotypes visualised using Congo red agar.\n\nResultsClinical strains clustered closely based on agr type, sequence type and clonal complex. COG analysis revealed statistically significant enrichment of COG families between core, accessory and unique pangenome groups. The unique genome was significantly enriched for replication, recombination and repair, and defence mechanisms. The presence of known virulence genes and toxins were high within this group, and unique genes were identified in 11 strains. Strains which were isolated from the same patient all surpassed average nucleotide identity thresholds, however, differed in phenotypic traits. Antimicrobial resistance to macrolides was significantly higher in the coinfection group.\n\nConclusionThere is huge variation in genetic and phenotypic capabilities of S. aureus strains. Further studies on how these may differ in relation to other species in the CF lung may give insight into inter-species interactions.\n\nData summaryThe assembled GenBank (gbk) files for all clinical isolates in this study have been deposited in ENA under the study accession PRJEB56184, accession numbers for each of the twenty-five clinical isolates have been provided in Table S1.

Identification of cell types via unsupervised clustering is one of the fundamental issues in analyzing single-cell data. However, due to the high dimensionality of expression profiles, traditional clustering methods are difficult to generate satisfactory results. To address this problem, we designed NetworkSSC, a network-guided sparse subspace clustering (SSC) approach. NetworkSSC is based on a similar assumption in SSC that the expression of cells within the same type lies in the same subspace. Moreover, it integrates an additional regularization term to include the gene networks Laplacian matrix, so as to utilize the network information. The comparison results of 5 scRNA-seq data sets show that NetworkSSC outperforms ordinary SSC and other clustering methods in most cases.",
