    "abstract": "Human NIMA-related kinases have primarily been studied for their roles in cell cycle progression (NEK1/2/6/7/9), checkpoint-DNA-damage control (NEK1/2/4/5/10/11), and ciliogenesis (NEK1/4/8). We previously showed that Caenorhabditis elegans NEKL-2 (NEK8/9 homolog) and NEKL-3 (NEK6/7 homolog) regulate apical clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in the worm epidermis and are essential for molting. Here we show that NEKL-2 and NEKL-3 also have distinct roles in controlling endosome function and morphology. Specifically, loss of NEKL-2 led to enlarged early endosomes with long tubular extensions but showed minimal effects on other compartments. In contrast, NEKL-3 depletion caused pronounced defects in early, late, and recycling endosomes. Consistently, NEKL-2 was strongly localized to early endosomes, whereas NEKL-3 was localized to multiple endosomal compartments. Loss of NEKLs also led to variable defects in the recycling of two resident cargoes of the trans-Golgi network (TGN), MIG-14/Wntless and TGN-38/TGN38, which were missorted to lysosomes after NEKL depletion. In addition, defects were observed in the uptake of clathrin-dependent (SMA-6/Type I BMP receptor) and independent cargoes (DAF-4/Type II BMP receptor) from the basolateral surface of epidermal cells after NEKL-2 or NEKL-3 depletion. Complementary studies in human cell lines further showed that siRNA knockdown of the NEKL-3 orthologs NEK6 and NEK7 led to missorting of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor from endosomes. Moreover, in multiple human cell types, depletion of NEK6 or NEK7 disrupted both early and recycling endosomal compartments, including the presence of excess tubulation within recycling endosomes, a defect also observed after NEKL-3 depletion in worms. Thus, NIMA family kinases carry out multiple functions during endocytosis in both worms and humans, consistent with our previous observation that human NEKL-3 orthologs can rescue molting and trafficking defects in C. elegans nekl-3 mutants. Our findings suggest that trafficking defects could underlie some of the proposed roles for NEK kinases in human disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryIntracellular trafficking is an evolutionary conserved process whereby cargoes, which include proteins, lipids, and other macromolecules, are internalized by cells, packaged into vesicles, and distributed to their proper places within the cell. This study demonstrated that two conserved NIMA-related kinases, NEKL-2 and NEKL-3, are required for the transport of multiple cargoes in the epidermis of C. elegans. NEKL-2 and NEKL-3 function at organelles, called endosomes, to regulate their morphology and control the sorting of cargoes between different intracellular compartments. In the absence of NEKL activities, various cargoes, including components of the BMP and Wnt signaling pathways, were misregulated. Our studies are further supported by results showing that the human counterparts of NEKL-3, NEK6 and NEK7, were also required for maintaining endosome morphologies and for the proper sorting of cargo in human cells. Notably, NIMA-kinases are well studied for their roles in cell cycle regulation, and overexpression of these kinases is linked to cancer formation and poor prognosis. Our study suggests their role in cancer progression could be partly due to the abnormal intracellular trafficking of conserved signaling components with known roles in cancer formation.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy can degrade RNA, with an intricate preference for specific RNAs. However, the mechanism remains unclear. During yeast meiosis, autophagy is active, while a subset of transcripts needs to survive until their programmed translation during and at the end of meiotic divisions. Thus, the challenge here is how meiotic autophagy temporally spares specific mRNAs. Rim4, a meiosis-specific RNA binding protein (RBP), sequesters a specific set of mid-late meiotic transcripts during early meiosis to suppress premature translation. Recently, we reported that autophagy degrades Rim4, while the underlying mechanism and the fate of transcripts in complex with Rim4 remain uncharacterized. Here, we show that Rim4 utilizes a nuclear localization signal (NLS) to enter the nucleus to load its mRNA substrates before the nuclear export. Once in the cytoplasm, the active autophagy spares Rim4-mRNA. Using combined genetic, biochemical, and cell imaging approaches, we show that autophagy selectively degrades Rim4 during meiotic divisions in an Atg11-dependent manner upon Rim4-bound mRNAs released for translation; meanwhile, released mRNAs also become sensitive to autophagy. In vitro, purified Rim4 and its RRM-motif-containing variants, but not Rim4-mRNA complex, activate Atg1 kinase activity in meiotic cell lysates and in the immunoprecipitated Atg1 complex, suggesting that the conserved RRMs are involved in stimulating Atg1 and hence selective autophagy. These findings indicate that autophagy inspects Rim4-mRNA interaction to ensure meiotic stage-specific translation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell technologies to analyze transcription and chromatin structure have been widely used in many research areas to reveal the functions and molecular properties of cells at single-cell resolution. Sample multiplexing techniques are valuable when performing single-cell analysis, reducing technical variation and permitting cost efficiencies. Several commercially available methods are available and have been used in many scRNA-seq studies. On the other hand, while several methods have been published, the multiplexing techniques for single nuclear Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (snATAC)-seq assays remain under development. We developed a simple nucleus hashing method using oligonucleotide conjugated antibodies recognizing nuclear pore complex proteins, NuHash, to perform snATAC-seq library preparations by multiplexing.\n\nResultsWe performed multiplexing snATAC-seq analyses on the mixture of human and mouse cell samples (two samples, 2-plex, and four samples, 4-plex) using NuHash. The demultiplexing accuracy of NuHash was high, and only ten out of 9,144 nuclei (2-plex) and 150 of 12,208 nuclei (4-plex) had discordant classifications between NuHash demultiplexing and discrimination using reference genome alignments. We compared results between snATAC-seq and deeply sequenced bulk ATAC-seq on the same samples and found that most of the peaks detected in snATAC-seq were also detected in deeply sequenced bulk ATAC-seq. The bulk ATAC-seq signal intensity was positively correlated with the number of cell subtype clusters detected in snATAC-seq, but not the subset of peaks detected in all clusters. These subsets of snATAC-seq peaks showed different distributions over different genomic features, suggesting that the peak intensities of bulk ATAC-seq can be used to identify different types of functional loci.\n\nConclusionsOur multiplexing method using oligo-conjugated anti-nuclear pore complex proteins, NuHash, permits high accuracy demultiplexing of samples. The NuHash protocol is straightforward, it works on frozen samples, and requires no modifications for snATAC-seq library preparation.",

    "abstract": "MRP4 is unique among the C family of ATP-binding cassette transporters for its role in translocating prostanoids, an important group of signaling molecules derived from unsaturated fatty acids. Using a reconstituted system, we report that a pair of prostaglandins (PGs) and the sulfonated-sterol DHEA-S preferentially enhance the ATPase activity of MRP4 over other previously proposed physiological substrates such as cyclic nucleotides or leukotrienes. We determined the cryo-EM structures of nanodisc embedded bovine MRP4 in (i) a nucleotide- and substrate-free state, (ii) in complex with PGE1, (iii) PGE2, and (iv) DHEA-S, and (v) a catalytically dead mutant E1202Q bound to ATP-Mg2+. The substrate-bound structures suggest unique features of the MRP4 binding site that distinguish its specificity for prostanoids from that of the related leukotriene transporter MRP1. The ATP-bound structure is in an outward-occluded conformation, revealing a novel state in the proposed alternate-access mechanism of MRP transport. Our study provides insights into the endogenous function of this versatile efflux transporter.",

Therefore, it should be possible to exploit lectins to target SARS-CoV-2 and inhibit cellular entry by binding glycans on the Spike protein. Burkholderia oklahomensis agglutinin (BOA) is an antiviral lectin that interacts with viral glycoproteins via N-linked high mannose glycans. Here, we show that BOA binds to the Spike protein and is a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry at nanomolar concentrations. Using a variety of biophysical tools, we demonstrate that the interaction is avidity driven and that BOA crosslinks the Spike protein into soluble aggregates. Furthermore, using virus neutralization assays, we demonstrate that BOA effectively inhibits all tested variants of concern as well as SARS-CoV 2003, establishing that glycan-targeting molecules have the potential to be pan-coronavirus inhibitors.",

LNPs enhance mRNA stability, circulation time, cellular uptake, and preferential delivery to specific tissues compared to mRNA with no carrier platform.

Here, we develop LNPs that enable high levels of mRNA delivery to trophoblasts in vitro and to the placenta in vivo with no toxicity. We conducted a Design of Experiments to explore how LNP composition, including the type and molar ratio of each lipid component, drives trophoblast and placental delivery. Our data revealed that a specific combination of ionizable lipid and phospholipid in the LNP design yields high transfection efficiency in vitro. Further, we present one LNP platform that exhibits highest delivery of placental growth factor mRNA to the placenta in pregnant mice, which demonstrates induced protein synthesis and secretion of a therapeutic protein. Lastly, our high-performing LNPs have no toxicity to both the pregnant mice and fetuses. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of LNPs as a platform for mRNA delivery to the placenta.

Conventional selections of adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsid libraries are inefficient at searching the vast sequence space for the small fraction of vectors possessing multiple traits essential for clinical translation. Here, we present Fit4Function, a generalizable machine learning (ML) approach for systematically engineering multi-trait AAV capsids. By leveraging a capsid library that evenly samples the manufacturable sequence space, reproducible screening data are generated to train accurate sequence-to-function models. Combining six models, we designed a multi-trait (liver-targeted, manufacturable) capsid library and validated 89% of library variants on all six predetermined criteria. Furthermore, the models, trained only on mouse in vivo and human in vitro Fit4Function data, accurately predicted AAV capsid variant biodistribution in macaque. Top candidates exhibited high production yields, efficient murine liver transduction, up to 1000-fold greater human hepatocyte transduction, and increased enrichment, relative to AAV9, in a screen for liver transduction in macaques. The Fit4Function strategy ultimately makes it possible to predict cross-species traits of peptide-modified AAV capsids and is a critical step toward assembling an ML atlas that predicts AAV capsid performance across dozens of traits.",

    "abstract": "Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) cause most bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs) worldwide. CT/NG co-infection is more common than expected due to chance, suggesting CT/NG interaction. However, CT/NG co-infection remains largely unstudied. Obligate intracellular CT has a characteristic biphasic developmental cycle consisting of two bacterial forms, infectious elementary bodies (EBs) and non-infectious, replicating reticulate bodies (RBs), which reside within host-derived, membrane-bound intracellular inclusions. Diverse stressors cause divergence from the normal chlamydial developmental cycle to an aberrant state called chlamydial persistence. Persistence can be induced by host-specific factors such as intracellular nutrient deprivation or cytokine exposure, and exogenous factors such as beta-lactam exposure, which disrupts RB to EB conversion. Persistent chlamydiae are atypical in appearance and, as such, are called aberrant bodies (ABs), but remain viable. The primary hallmark of persistence is reversibility of this temporary non-infectious state; upon removal of the stressor, persistent chlamydiae re-enter normal development, and production of infectious EBs resumes. The beta-lactam amoxicillin (AMX) has been shown to induce chlamydial persistence in a murine vaginal infection model, using the mouse pathogen C. muridarum (CM) to model human CT infection. This remains, to date, the sole experimentally tractable in vivo model of chlamydial persistence. Recently, we found that penicillinase-producing NG (PPNG) can alleviate AMX-induced CT and CM persistence in vitro. We hypothesized that PPNG vaginal co-infection would also alleviate AMX-induced CM persistence in mice. To evaluate this hypothesis, we modified the CM/AMX persistence mouse model, incorporating CM/PPNG co-infection. Contradicting our hypothesis, and recent in vitro findings, PPNG vaginal co-infection failed to alleviate AMX-induced CM persistence.",

    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose a health risk concern to humans, despite a significant increase in vaccination rates, an effective prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection is being sought worldwide. Herbal medicines have been used for years and played a tremendous role in several epidemics of respiratory viral infections. Thus, they are considered as a promising platform to combat SARS-CoV-2. Previously, we reported that common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) leaf extract and its high molecular weight compounds strongly suppressed in vitro lung cell infection by SARS-CoV-2 Spike D614 and Delta variant pseudotyped lentivirus. We now here demonstrate that T. officinale extract protects against the most prominent Omicron variant using hACE2-TMPRSS2 overexpressing A549 cells as in vitro model system. Notably, compared to the original D614, and the Delta variant, we could confirm a higher efficacy. Short-term interval treatment of only 30 min was then sufficient to block the infection by 80% at 10 mg/mL extract. Further subfractionation of the extract identified compounds larger than 50 kDa as effective ACE2-Spike binding inhibitors. In summary, the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 virus to the highly transmissible Omicron variant did not lead to resistance, but rather increased sensitivity to the preventive effect of the extract.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory surveillance of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes is crucial for the successful implementation of vaccines to prevent invasive pneumococcal diseases. The reference method of serotyping is the Quellung reaction, which is labor-intensive and expensive.\n\nIn the last few years, the introduction of MALDI-TOF MS into the microbiology laboratory has been revolutionary. In brief, this new technology compares protein profiles by generating spectra based on the mass to charge ratio (m/z).\n\nWe evaluated the performance of MALDI-TOF MS for typing serotypes of S. pneumoniae isolates included in the PCV13 vaccine using a machine learning approach. We challenged our classification algorithms in \"real time\" with a total of new 100 isolates of S. pneumoniae from Argentinian nationwide surveillance.\n\nOur best approach could correctly identify the isolates with a sensitivity of 58.33 % ([95%IC 40.7-71.7]); specificity of 81.48 % ([95%IC 53.6-79.7]); accuracy of 63.0% ([95%IC 61.9-93.7]); PPV of 80.77% ([95%IC 64.5-90.6]) and NPV of 59.46% ([95%IC 48.9-69.2]).\n\nIn this work, it was possible to demonstrate that the combination of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and multivariate analysis allows the development of new strategies for the identification and characterization of Spn isolates of clinical importance; and we consider that by using AI, as more data becomes available the models will get better and more precise.",

    "abstract": "Ancylostoma caninum is the most common nematode parasite of dogs in the United States. This study aimed to describe the molecular epidemiology of A. caninum isolates from the central and eastern states of the U.S. using the partial mitochondrial cox1 gene and to compare them with those reported globally. We isolated eggs from fecal samples of dogs and characterized each isolate based on cox1 sequences. A total of 60 samples originating from Kansas, Iowa, New York, Florida, and Massachusetts were included. 25 haplotypes were identified in the U.S. dataset with high haplotype diversity (0.904). Sequence data were compared to sequences from other world regions available in GenBank. Global haplotype analysis demonstrated 35 haplotypes with a haplotype diversity of 0.931. Phylogenetic and network analysis provide evidence for the existence of moderate geographical structuring of A. caninum haplotypes. Our results provide an updated summary of A. caninum haplotypes and data for neutral genetic markers with utility for tracking hookworm populations. Sequences have been deposited in GenBank (ON980650 - ON980674). Further studies of isolates from other regions are essential to understand the genetic diversity of this parasite.",

    "abstract": "In budding yeast, Rim4 sequesters a subset of meiotic transcripts and essentially suppresses their translation until being degraded at the end of meiosis I. We found that Rim4 loads mRNAs in the nucleus as a prerequisite for relocating Rim4 into the cytoplasm, where mRNAs protect Rim4 from autophagy. Nonetheless, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Using genetic, biochemical, and cell imaging approaches, here, we revealed that phosphorylation states regulate Rim4s intracellular interactions with mRNAs and the yeast 14-3-3 proteins Bmh1 and Bmh2. Our data showed that Rim4 forms a heterotrimeric complex with Bmh1 and Bmh2 via multiple phosphorylated sites with the consensus of a PKA kinase target. Remarkably, the Bmh1/2-Rim4 complex excludes mRNAs and is resistant to autophagy. We further found that Cdc14, a conserved cell cycle phosphatase, binds to a canonical Cdc14 docking site (PxL) in Rim4s C-terminal low complexity domain (LCD) to de-phosphorylate Rim4 at multiple sites, resulting in Bmh1/2-Rim4 disassembly. Notably, before meiotic cell divisions, Cdc14 primarily resides in the nucleus, where mRNAs are transcribed. Therefore, Cdc14-triggered Bmh1/2 dissociation facilitates the nuclear Rim4 to target and sequester the nascent mRNAs. In contrast, during the meiotic divisions, Rim4-sequestered mRNAs are released for translation, while Cdc14 mediates Rim4-Bmh1/2 disassembly in the cytoplasm due to its temporary cytoplasmic relocation at the anaphases; subsequently, loss of protection from mRNAs and Bmh1/2 leads to autophagy-mediated Rim4 degradation at this stage. We conclude that phosphorylation states spatiotemporally regulate Rim4s meiotic interactions, subcellular localization, and stability, regulated by Cdc14.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of African sleeping sickness, uses its flagellum for movement, cell division, and signaling. The flagellum is anchored to the cell body membrane via the flagellar attachment zone (FAZ), a complex of proteins, filaments, and microtubules that spans two membranes with elements on both flagellum and cell body sides. How FAZ components are carried into place to form this complex is poorly understood. Here, we show that the trypanosome-specific kinesin KIN-E is required for building the FAZ in bloodstream-form parasites. KIN-E is localized along the flagellum with a concentration at its distal tip. Depletion of KIN-E by RNAi rapidly inhibits flagellum attachment and leads to cell death. A detailed analysis reveals that KIN-E depletion phenotypes include failure in cytokinesis completion, kinetoplast DNA mis-segregation, and transport vesicle accumulation. Together with previously published results in procyclic form parasites, these data suggest KIN-E plays a critical role in FAZ assembly in T. brucei.",

    "abstract": "Crossovers (CO) shuffle genetic information and physically connect homologous chromosome pairs, ensuring their balanced segregation during meiosis. COs arising from the major class I pathway require the activity of a well-conserved ZMMs group of proteins which, in conjunction with MLH1, facilitate the maturation of DNA recombination intermediates specifically into COs. The HEIP1 protein was identified in rice and proposed to be a new, plant-specific member of the ZMM group. Here we establish and decipher the function of the Arabidopsis thaliana HEIP1 homolog in meiotic crossover formation and report its wide conservation in eukaryotes. We show that the loss of Arabidopsis HEIP1 elicits a marked reduction in meiotic COs and their redistribution towards chromosome ends. Epistasis analysis showed that AtHEIP1 acts specifically in the class I CO pathway. Further, we show that HEI1P acts both prior to crossover designation, as the number of MLH1 foci is reduced in heip1, and at the maturation step of MLH1-marked sites into COs. Despite the HEIP1 protein being predicted to be primarily unstructured and very divergent at the sequence level, we identified homologs of HEIP1 in an extensive range of eukaryotes, including mammals.",

    "abstract": "The Integrated Stress Response (ISR) enables cells to survive a variety of acute stresses, but chronic activation of the ISR underlies age-related diseases. ISR signaling down-regulates translation and activates expression of stress-responsive factors that promote return to homeostasis, and is initiated by inhibition of the decameric guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B. Conformational and assembly transitions regulate eIF2B activity, but the allosteric mechanisms controlling these dynamic transitions are unknown. Using hydrogen deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry and cryo-EM, we identified a single alpha-helix whose orientation allosterically controls eIF2B conformation and assembly. Biochemical and signaling assays show that this \"Switch-Helix\" controls eIF2B activity and signaling in cells. In sum, the Switch-Helix acts as a fulcrum of eIF2B conformational regulation and is a highly conserved actuator of ISR signal transduction. This work uncovers a novel allosteric mechanism and unlocks new therapeutic possibilities for ISR-linked diseases.",

    "abstract": "The hydrophobic pocket found in the N-heptad repeat (NHR) region of HIV-1 gp41 is a highly conserved epitope that is the target of various HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. Although the high conservation of the pocket makes it an attractive vaccine candidate, it has been challenging to elicit potent anti-NHR antibodies via immunization. Here, we solved a high-resolution structure of the NHR mimetic IQN17, and, consistent with previous ligand-bound gp41 pocket structures, we observed remarkable conformational plasticity of the pocket. The high malleability of this pocket led us to test whether we could improve the immunogenicity of the gp41 pocket by stabilizing its conformation. We show that the addition of five amino acids at the C-terminus of IQN17, to generate IQN22, introduces a stabilizing salt bridge at the base of the peptide that rigidifies the pocket. Mice immunized with IQN22 elicited higher avidity antibodies against the gp41 pocket and a more potent, albeit still weak, neutralizing response against HIV-1 compared to IQN17. Stabilized epitope-focused immunogens could serve as the basis for future HIV-1 fusion-inhibiting vaccines.",

    "abstract": "When a denatured protein isoform (i.e., a proteoform) immersed in electrolyte is impelled by an electric field through a sub-nanometer-diameter pore (i.e., a sub-nanopore) spanning a thin membrane, the sequence of amino acid (AA) residues constituting the proteoform can be directly \"read\" one at a time by measuring fluctuations in the electrolytic current. Corroborating this assertion, an analysis of the pore current with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations reveals that the fluctuations are correlated to the sequence of AA volumes, the water in the pore and acid mobility. After alignment to account for variations in the acid mobility, the simulated pore current is nearly perfectly correlated to the pattern of empirical fluctuations. To prove out the prospects for decoding proteoforms this way, site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs) and point mutations in amyloid-beta (A{beta}1-42) were analyzed with a sub-nanopore. The results show that single acids can be resolved in proteoforms with a dynamic range limited by the size of phenylalanine and glycine. With this sensitivity and single acid resolution, the sequence of a scrambled variant of A{beta}1-42 was discriminated with a p-value < 10-5.",

Clonal families identification is key to understanding B-cell repertoire function, evolution and dynamics. We present HILARy (High-precision Inference of Lineages in Antibody Repertoires), an efficient, fast and precise method to identify clonal families from high-throughput sequencing datasets. HILARy combines probabilistic models that capture the receptor generation and selection statistics with adapted clustering methods to achieve consistently high inference accuracy. It automatically leverages the phylogenetic signal of shared mutations in difficult repertoire subsets. Exploiting the high sensitivity of the method, we find the statistics of evolutionary properties such as the site frequency spectrum and dN/dS ratio do not depend on the junction length.

By comparing the full-length transcriptome and proteome within the same sample, we identified mRNAs linked to B cell activation and antibody secretion that are expressed without detectable protein. These \"poised\" mRNAs might enable rapid protein production through increased translation or protein stability. In addition, through interrogation of our proteomic dataset, we found that the translational repressor PDCD4 restrains the response of marginal zone B cells to a T-independent antigen. Our molecular characterization of B cell maturation is a valuable resource to further explore the mechanisms underpinning the specialised functions of B cell subsets.",

However, the formation of silica nanostructures with site-specific addressability has thus far not been explored. Here we show that silica nanostructures templated by DNA origami remain addressable for post silicification modification with guest molecules even if the silica shell measures several nm in thickness. We used the conjugation of fluorescently labelled oligonucleotides to different silicified DNA origami structures carrying a complementary ssDNA handle as well as DNA PAINT super-resolution imaging to show that ssDNA handles remain unsilicified and thus ensure retained addressability. We also demonstrate that not only handles, but also ssDNA scaffold segments within a DNA origami nanostructure remain accessible, allowing for the formation of dynamic silica nanostructures. Finally we demonstrate the power of this approach by forming 3D DNA origami crystals from silicified monomers. Our results thus present a fully site-specifically addressable silica nanostructure with complete control over size and shape.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVascular diseases like atherosclerosis or aortic aneurysms are common pathologies in the western world, promoting various, potentially fatal conditions. Hence, a plethora of animal models have been developed to investigate underlying mechanisms and potential therapeutics. Here we evaluate high resolution (HR) ultrasound in mouse models of atherosclerosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) for noninvasive monitoring of morphological and functional vascular changes in vivo.\n\nMethodsEight-week-old ApoE-/- mice were used for disease models. For induction of atherosclerosis, mice were fed a western diet over 12 weeks. To trigger AAA development, osmotic minipumps were implanted, permanently releasing Angiotensin II continuously for 28 days. All animals were on C57Bl6/J background. HR vascular ultrasound of the carotid artery or the abdominal aorta was performed, respectively. Images obtained were analyzed by a speckle tracking algorithm (VevoVasc software) and were correlated with histological analyses by Picro Sirius Red staining and automated collagen quantification.\n\nResultsArterial wall distensibility and global radial strain (GRS) as measures of arterial wall elasticity were reduced in the carotids of atherosclerotic mice as well as in the aortas of AAA mice. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) was elevated in both disease models. Intima-media thickness (IMT) was significantly increased in the atherosclerosis model. Matching those findings, area of the tunica media was enlarged in ApoE-/- mice fed a western diet, and in Angiotensin II treated mice as measured by automated image analysis, depicting higher collagen depositions in diseased arteries. Simple regression analysis revealed a strong correlation of media collagen content and area in AAA with IMT and GRS, respectively. In atherosclerosis, media collagen content significantly correlated with PWV and GRS, whereas wall distensibility was associated with the size of media area.\n\nConclusionVascular imaging using latest generation HR ultrasound devices is suitable to trace changes of arterial wall properties in murine models of atherosclerosis and AAA. Obtained results not only correlate with histological findings but deliver information on functional parameters which may be used as early disease and risk markers in a longitudinal experimental approach.",

Under the assumption that true causal variants are common across studies, we implement a novel version of JAM that conditions on multiple SNPs while explicitly incorporating the different LD structures across populations. The mJAM framework can be used to first select index variants using the mJAM likelihood with any feature selection approach. In addition, we present a novel approach leveraging the ideas of mediation to construct credible sets for these index variants. Construction of such credible sets can be performed given any existing index variants. We illustrate the implementation of the mJAM likelihood through two implementations: mJAM-SuSiE (a Bayesian approach) and mJAM-Forward selection. Through simulation studies based on realistic effect sizes and levels of LD, we demonstrated that mJAM performs better than other existing multi-ethnic methods for constructing concise credible sets that include the underlying causal variants. In real data examples taken from the most recent multi-population prostate cancer GWAS, we showed several practical advantages of mJAM over other existing methods.",

    "abstract": "Ocular coloboma (OC) is a failure of complete optic fissure closure during embryonic development and presents as a tissue defect along the proximal distal axis of the ventral eye. It is classed as part of the clinical spectrum of structural eye malformations with microphthalmia and anophthalmia, collectively abbreviated to MAC. Despite deliberate attempts to identify causative variants in MAC, many patients remain without a genetic diagnosis. To reveal potential candidate genes, we utilised transcriptomes experimentally generated from embryonic eye tissues derived from human, mouse, zebrafish, and chicken at stages coincident with optic fissure closure. Our in-silico analyses found 10 genes with optic fissure specific enriched expression: ALDH1A3, BMPR1B, EMX2, EPHB3, NID1, NTN1, PAX2, SMOC1, TENM3, and VAX1. In situ hybridization revealed that all 10 genes were broadly expressed ventrally in the developing eye, but that only PAX2 and NTN1 were expressed in cells at the edges of the optic fissure margin. Of these conserved optic fissure genes, EMX2, NID1, and EPHB3 have not previously been associated with human MAC cases. Targeted genetic manipulation in zebrafish embryos using CRISPR/Cas9 caused the developmental MAC phenotype for emx2 and ephb3. We scrutined available whole genome sequencing datasets from MAC patients and identified a range of variants with plausible causality. In combination our data suggest that expression of genes involved in ventral eye development are conserved across a range of vertebrate species, and that EMX2, NID1, and EPHB3 are candidate loci that should be adopted into clinical diagnostic screens for patients with structural eye malformations.",
