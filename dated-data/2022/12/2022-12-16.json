    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells is mediated by the Spike (S) protein of the viral envelope. The S protein is composed of two subunits: S1 that induces binding to the host cell via its interaction with the ACE2 receptor of the cell surface and S2 that triggers fusion between viral and cellular membranes. Fusion by S2 depends on its heptad repeat domains that bring membranes close together, and its fusion peptide (FP) that interacts with and perturb the membrane structure to trigger fusion. Recent studies suggest that cholesterol and ceramide lipids from the cell surface may facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells, but their exact mode of action remains unknown. We have used a combination of in vitro liposome-liposome and in situ cell-cell fusion assays to study the lipid determinants of S-mediated membrane fusion. We found that cholesterol and ceramide both facilitated fusion, suggesting that targeting lipids could be effective against SARS-CoV-2. As proof of concept, we examined the effect of chlorpromazine (CPZ), an antipsychotic drug known to perturb membrane structure. We found that CPZ inhibited S-mediated membrane fusion and thus potentially SARS-CoV-2 entry.",

    "abstract": "Tau proteins are gaining a lot of interest recently due to their active role in causing a range of tauopathies. Molecular mechanisms underlying the tau interaction with the neuronal membrane are hitherto unknown and difficult to characterize using conventional experimental methods. Starting from the cryo-EM structure of the tau fibrils, we have used atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to model the interaction between the fibril and neuronal membrane, with explicit solvation. The dynamics and structural characteristics of the tau fibril with the neuronal membrane are compared to the tau fibril in the aqueous phase to corroborate the effect of the neuronal membrane on the tau structure. The tau fibrils are in general more compact in the presence of neuronal membrane compared to their structure in the water medium. We find that the number of {beta} -sheet residues of the tau fibrils are different in the case of two polymorphs, paired helical filament and straight filaments (PHF and SF) in the two media. PHF is found to approach closer to the neuronal membrane than the SF. The negatively charged lipids in the neuronal membrane are found to mediate the tau-neuronal membrane binding. Our study initiates the understanding of tau conformational ensemble in the presence of neuronal membrane and sheds light on the significant tau - membrane interactions. The simulation times of our report might limit the conformational sampling required to observe membrane permeation, nevertheless it provides significant insights into fibril - neuronal membrane interactions.",

    "abstract": "Ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics are critical parameters for drug design. However, it has proven challenging to efficiently predict ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics from molecular simulations due to limited simulation timescales. Protein dynamics especially in the ligand binding pocket often plays an important role in ligand binding. Based on our previously developed Ligand Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (LiGaMD), here we present LiGaMD2 in which a selective boost potential was applied to both the ligand and protein residues in the binding pocket to improve sampling of ligand binding and dissociation. To validate the performance of LiGaMD2, the T4 lysozyme (T4L) mutants with open and closed pockets bound by different ligands were chosen as model systems. LiGaMD2 could efficiently capture repetitive ligand dissociation and binding within microsecond simulations of all T4L systems. The obtained ligand binding kinetic rates and free energies agreed well with available experimental values and previous modeling results. Therefore, LiGaMD2 provides an improved approach to sample opening of closed protein pockets for ligand dissociation and binding, thereby allowing for efficient calculations of ligand binding thermodynamics and kinetics.",

    "abstract": "Amphitropic proteins and peptides reversibly partition from solution to membrane, a key process that regulates their functions. Experimental approaches, such as fluorescence and circular dichroism, are classically used to measure the partitioning of amphitropic peptides and proteins into lipid bilayers, yet hardly usable when the peptides or proteins do not exhibit significant polarity and/or conformational changes upon membrane binding. Here, we describe B2LiVe (i.e., Binding to Lipid Vesicles), a simple, robust, and widely applicable NMR method to determine the solution-to-membrane partitioning of unlabeled proteins or peptides. The experimental strategy proposed here relies on previously described proton 1D NMR fast pulsing techniques with selective adiabatic pulses. Membrane partitioning induces a large line broadening leading to a progressive loss of protein signals, and therefore, the decrease of the NMR signal directly measures the fraction of membrane-bound protein. The B2LiVe method uses low polypeptide concentrations and has been validated on several membrane-interacting peptides and proteins, ranging from 3 to 54 kDa, with membrane vesicles of different sizes and various lipid compositions.\n\nMotivationCharacterization of the interaction of peptides and proteins with lipid membranes is involved in various biological processes and is often challenging for polypeptides which do not possess intrinsic fluorophores, do not exhibit significant structural content changes, as well as for those characterized by low affinities for membranes. To meet these challenges, we have developed a simple and robust label-free NMR-based experimental approach, named B2LiVe, to measure the binding of polypeptides to lipid vesicles. The experimental strategy relies on previously described proton 1D NMR fast pulsing techniques with selective adiabatic pulses to excite the amide resonances. B2LiVe is a label-free method based on the observation of amide hydrogen nuclei which are naturally present in all protein and peptide backbones. Our results validate the B2LiVe method and indicate that it compares well with established technics to quantify polypeptide-membrane interactions. Overall, B2LiVe should efficiently complement the arsenal of label-free biophysical assays available to characterize protein-membrane interactions.\n\nIn briefWe describe a robust label-free NMR-based experimental approach (B2LiVe) to measure interactions between peptides or proteins with membranes. The validity of this approach has been established on several polypeptides and on various membrane vesicles. The B2LiVe method efficiently complements the arsenal of label-free biophysical techniques to characterize protein-membrane interactions.\n\nHighlightsB2LiVe is a simple and robust NMR-based method to quantify affinity of proteins and peptides for membranes\n\nB2LiVe is a label-free approach that relies on proton 1D NMR fast pulsing techniques with selective excitation of amide resonances\n\nB2LiVe has been validated on several membrane-interacting peptides and proteins\n\nB2LiVe coupled to DOSY can pinpoint the presence within a membrane-bound protein of polypeptide segments remaining in solution",

    "abstract": "Synergistic drug combinations are an attractive anticancer strategy but prove challenging to identify. Here we present a stepwise approach consisting in revealing core cancer vulnerabilities and exploiting them through drug combination screen to uncover synergistic treatments for glioblastoma patients.\n\nMethodsWe established an innovative method, based on high-throughput screening, target deconvolution and functional genomics, to reveal core vulnerabilities in glioblastoma. Combination drug screen targeting these vulnerabilities was then designed to unveil synergistic associations. The therapeutic potential of the top drug combination was validated in two different clinically-relevant models: an organotypic ex vivo model and a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model of glioblastoma.\n\nResultsLarge-scale monotherapy drug screening identified 83 potent anti-glioblastoma compounds. Target deconvolution using public chemoinformatic databases uncovered 1,100 targets and interactors of the hit compounds. Screening of a focused siRNA library targeting the top 292 drug interactors revealed 22 targetable vulnerabilities, 9 of which were confirmed as core glioblastoma vulnerabilities by mining the CRISPR screen cohort data from the online Cancer Dependency Map portal. Six selective inhibitors of the core vulnerabilities were then screened in combination with a custom-made library of 88 compounds and synergies amongst the 528 tested pairwise combinations were predicted. The combinations of CHK1 / MEK and AURKA / BET inhibitors were highlighted and validated in 3D tumor spheroids. Using an organotypic ex vivo model and a syngeneic orthotopic mouse model, we definitively ascertained the efficacy of dual AURKA / BET inhibition in glioblastoma.\n\nConclusionsCollectively, we uncovered that dual inhibition of BET proteins and aurora kinase A is highly synergistic against GBM. Moreover, our study indicates that our approach to exploit drug poly-pharmacology for the rational design of drug combination screens represent a valuable strategy to discover synergistic treatments against refractory cancers.",

    "abstract": "Motor learning is not only a key invention of the many new animals evolving new body plans during the Cambrian, it is also central to human existence such as in learning to speak or walk, rehabilitation after injury, or sports. Evidence suggests that all forms of motor learning may share an evolutionary conserved molecular plasticity pathway. Here we present novel insights into the molecular processes underlying a kind of motor learning in the fruit fly Drosophila, operant self-learning. We have discovered that the Forkhead Box gene FoxP is not required in the fly brain for this type of learning. Instead, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) appears to be a central component in a plasticity process that takes place in FoxP-expressing motor neurons in the ventral nerve cord. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out canonical aPKC interaction partners bazooka and the kidney and brain gene (KIBRA) in adult animals, we found that aPKC likely acts via non-canonical pathways in this form of learning. We also found that 14 but not 7 days after CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of FoxP in adult animals, learning is impaired, suggesting that adult FoxP expression is required for operant self-learning.",

    "abstract": "Spatial orientation is a prerequisite for most behaviors. In insects, the underlying neural computations take place in the central complex (CX), the brains navigational center. In this region different streams of sensory information converge to enable context-dependent navigational decisions. Accordingly, a variety of CX input neurons deliver information about different navigation-relevant cues. In bees, direction encoding polarized light signals converge with translational optic flow signals that are suited to encode the flight speed of the animals. The continuous integration of speed and directions in the CX can be used to generate a vector memory of the bees current position in space in relation to its nest, i.e. perform path integration. This process depends on specific, complex features of the optic flow encoding CX input neurons, but it is unknown how this information is derived from the visual periphery. Here, we thus aimed at gaining insight into how simple motion signals are reshaped upstream of the speed encoding CX input neurons to generate their complex features. Using electrophysiology and anatomical analyses of the halictic bees Megalopta genalis and Megalopta centralis, we identified a wide range of motion-sensitive neurons connecting the optic lobes with the central brain. While most neurons formed pathways with characteristics incompatible with CX speed neurons, we showed that one group of lobula projection neurons possess some physiological and anatomical features required to generate the visual responses of CX optic-flow encoding neurons. However, as these neurons cannot explain all features of CX speed cells, local interneurons of the central brain or alternative input cells from the optic lobe are additionally required to construct inputs with sufficient complexity to deliver speed signals suited for path integration in bees.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the role of indoor environments on disease transmission. Enclosed spaces where pathogen-laden aerosols accumulate was strongly linked to increased transmission events. Here we employ a surrogate non-pathogenic virus, the bacteriophage phi6, to interrogate aerosol transmission in classroom environments that do not have any natural or mechanical ventilation in order to determine how effectively aerosols facilitate new infections. We find that virus-laden aerosols establish new infections over all distances tested within minutes and that the time of exposure did not change transmission rate. We further find that humidity, but not temperature nor a UV-based disinfection device, significantly impacted transmission rates. Our data suggest that, even without mechanical ventilation, relative humidity remains a highly effective mitigation strategy while UV air treatment did not.\n\nPractical ImplicationsTransmission of pathogens through airborne particles is a major source of disease transmission. People now spend much of their time indoors, thus understanding indoor airborne transmission is vital to managing outbreaks. Most classrooms in the U.S. do not have any mechanical ventilation systems and so here, we test airborne transmission of a virus in such classrooms. Infection transmission rates are not greatly impacted by distance, time or even some UV treatment, but are curbed by the amount of moisture in the air.",

    "abstract": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne Flavivirus, which may cause severe encephalitis in humans, horses, and other animals. TIM-1 has been identified to be a receptor that promotes various viruses to enter into target cells in recent years. In the present study, we found that TIM-1 protein was significantly increased in A549 cells at the late stage of JEV infection, while the transcription levels of TIM-1 remained unaltered. Interestingly, we found that NS1 protein plays a key role in increasing the expression of TIM-1 in cells infected with JEV. Further, we found that the NS1 protein also efficiently regulates TIM-1 protein to distribute in the cytoplasm in JEV-infected cells, and the amount of TIM-1 protein located on the cell membrane was reduced instead. As a consequence, NS1 protein antagonize TIM-1 mediated viral restriction for further viral infection and propagation in the late stage of infection. In molecular mechanism, the molecular weight of TIM-1 increased a bit in the present of NS1. Expression of NEU1 down-regulated TIM-1 expression and oseltamivir treatment increased the expression of TIM-1. Therefore, our data indicated that JEV NS1 protein facilitated the sialylation modification of TIM-1 to up-regulate the level of TIM-1 expression and regulate its distribution. Collectively, our study revealed that JEV NS1 protein regulates the expression and distribution of TIM-1 by facilitating its sialylation to antagonize TIM-1-mediated JEV restriction for further infection. Understanding the functional interplays between TIM-1 and NS1 proteins will offer new insights into virushost interaction.\n\nIMPORTANCET-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain protein 1 (TIM-1) is known to promote cellular entry of various enveloped viruses. We discovered a novel phenomenon of dynamic expression and functional regulation of TIM-1 during JEV infection. Firstly, TIM-1 protein increased in the cytoplasm at the late stage of JEV infection. Furthermore, JEV NS1 protein up-regulated the intracellular expression of TIM-1 and antagonize TIM-1-mediated viral restriction for further viral infection. In molecular mechanism, JEV NS1 protein facilitated the sialylation of TIM-1 to increase the level of TIM-1 expression and cytoplasm distribution. Taken together, at the late stage of infection, JEV employs a strategy in which NS1 promotes JEV release by promoting the sialylation of TIM-1, causing it to be primarily localized in the cytoplasm. Therefore, we discovered new functions of TIM-1 and JEV NS1 during the process of JEV infection, and provide a new insight into the interactions between JEV and cell hosts.",

Various times (3, 4, and 5 minutes) at pressure intensity levels of 600 MPa, (87K PSI), 550 MPa (79K PSI), 480 MPa (70K PSI), 415 MPa (60K PSI), and 345 MPa (50K PSI) of elevated hydrostatic pressure (Hub880 Explorer, Pressure BioScience Inc), were investigated at 4{degrees}C and for 45{degrees}C for inactivation of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 (STEC) (ATCC numbers BAA 460, 43888, 43894, 35150, 43889, and 43890) respectively,  Big Six non-O157 Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (nSTEC) (ATCC numbers BAA 2196, 2193, 2215, 2440, 2219, and 2192) respectively, Salmonella serovars (ATCC numbers 13076, 8387, 6962, 9270, and 14028) respectively, and Listeria monocytogenes (ATCC numbers 51772, 51779, BAA 2657, and BAA 13932). Studies were conducted in two biologically independent repetitions as a blocking factors of a randomized complete block design containing three repetitions per time/treatment within each block, analyzed statistically using GLM procedures of SAS 9.4 software at type one error level at 5% using Tukey- and Dunnett-adjusted ANOVA. A Barocycler Hub840 unit (Pressure BioScience Inc., Southeastern, MA), equipped with a water jacket and circulating water bath for precise application of hydrostatic pressure and controlled temperature was utilized.\n\nUp to 0.95 and 2.60 log reductions (P<0.05) of non-habituated Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli Non-O157 at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 345 MPa and 550 MPa for 5 minutes and 4 minutes, respectively at 4{degrees}C. Up to 4.42 and 5.10 log reductions (P<0.05) of non-habituated Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli Non-O157 at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 345 MPa and 480 MPa for 5 minutes and 4 minutes, respectively at 45{degrees}C. Up to 1.63 and 3.14 log reductions (P < 0.05) of non-habituated Listeria monocytogenes at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 345 MPa and 600 MPa for 5 minutes and 3 minutes, respectively at 4{degrees}C. Up to 4.91 and 6.37 log reductions (P < 0.05) of non-habituated Listeria monocytogenes at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 550 MPa and 480 MPa for 4 minutes, respectively at 45{degrees}C. Up to 2.87 and 5.82 log reductions (P< 0.05) of non-habituated Salmonella serovars at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 345 MPa and 550 MPa for 5 minutes and 4 minutes, respectively at 4{degrees}C. Up to 5.17 and 6.79 log reductions (P< 0.05) of non-habituated Salmonella serovars at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 415 MPa and 600 MPa for 5 minutes and 3 minutes, respectively at 45{degrees}C. Up to 0.86 and 1.35 log reductions (P<0.05) of non-habituated Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 345 MPa and 480 MPa for 5 minutes and 4 minutes, respectively at 4{degrees}C. Up to 2.02 and 6.12 log reductions (P<0.05) of non-habituated Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7 at planktonic stages were achieved using application of pressure at 345 MPa and 550 MPa for 5 minutes and 4 minutes, respectively at 45{degrees}C. Results of this study could be incorporated as a part of predictive public health microbiology modeling and risk assessment analysis for prevention of pathogen related disease and illness episodes.",

Here, we assessed the involvement of the Arp2/3 mediated branched actin in HIV-1 assembly at the membrane of infected CD4 T lymphocytes. Our results show that actin debranching not only increases HIV-1 release but also the number of individual HIV-1 assembly clusters present at the cell plasma membrane unravelling new mechanisms. Indeed, we showed that, in infected T lymphocytes, HIV-1 Gag prefers areas deficient in F-actin for assembly. In vitro, we could reproduce and quantify this mechanism using model systems. Finally, we found that the actin debranching factor, Arpin, an Arp2/3 inhibitor, is recruited by Gag at the cell membrane to promote virus assembly. Altogether, our data show that HIV-1 favors local actin debranching for assembly and release by subverting the host factor Arpin.",

    "abstract": "Plasticity between cell lineages is a fundamental but poorly understood property of regenerative tissues. In the gut tube, small intestine absorbs nutrients whereas colon absorbs electrolytes. In a striking display of inherent plasticity, adult colonic mucosa lacking the chromatin factor SATB2 is converted to small intestine. Using proteomics and CRISPR-Cas9 screen, we identified MTA2 as a crucial component of the molecular machinery that, together with SATB2, restrain colonic plasticity. MTA2 loss in adult mouse colon activated lipid absorptive genes and functional lipid uptake. Mechanistically, MTA2 co-binds with HNF4A, an activating pan-intestine transcription factor (TF), on colonic chromatin. MTA2 loss leads to HNF4A release from colonic and gain on small intestinal chromatin. SATB2 similarly restrains colonic plasticity through a HNF4A-dependent mechanism. Our study provides a generalizable model of lineage plasticity in which broadly-expressed TFs are retained on tissue-specific enhancers to maintain cell identity and prevent activation of alternative lineages; their release unleashes plasticity.",

In this study, we demonstrated the importance of ClpP/ClpX for meiosis and spermatogenesis with two conditional knockout (cKO) mouse models. We found that ClpP/ClpX deficiency reduced mitochondrial functions and quantity in spermatocytes, affected energy supply during meiosis and attenuated zygotene-pachytene transformation of the male germ cells. The dysregulated spermatocytes finally underwent apoptosis resulting in decreased testicular size and vacuolar structures within the seminiferous tubules. We found mTORC1 pathway was over-activated after deletion of ClpP/ClpX in spermatocytes. Long-term inhibition of the mTORC1 signaling via rapamycin treatment in vivo partially rescue spermatogenesis. The data reveal the novel roles of ClpP and ClpX in regulating meiosis and spermatogenesis.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryClpP/ClpX is required for maintaining mitochondrial functions in spermatocytes during meiosis and spermatogenesis.",

A regulatory role for TEs has been suggested in embryonal development and diseases such as cancer but systematic investigation of their functions has been limited by their widespread silencing in the genome. Here, we have utilized unbiased massively parallel reporter assay data using whole human genome library to identify TEs with functional enhancer activity in two human cancer types of endodermal lineage, colorectal and liver cancers. We show that the identified TE enhancers are characterized by genomic features associated with active enhancers, such as epigenetic marks and TF binding. Importantly, we identified distinct TE subfamilies that function as tissue-specific enhancers, namely MER11- and LTR12-elements in colon and liver cancers, respectively. These elements are bound by distinct TFs in each cell type, and they have predicted associations to differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate how different cancer types can utilize distinct TEs as tissue-specific enhancers, paving the way for comprehensive understanding of the role of TEs as bona fide enhancers in the cancer genomes.",

    "abstract": "Comparative analyses of mycobacteriophage genomes reveals extensive genetic diversity in genome organization and gene content, contributing to widespread mosaicism. We previously reported that the prophage of mycobacteriophage Butters (cluster N) provides defense against infection by Island3 (subcluster I1). To explore the anti-Island3 defense mechanism, we attempted to isolate Island3 defense escape mutants on a Butters lysogen, but only uncovered phages with recombinant genomes comprised of regions of Butters and Island3 arranged from left arm to right arm as Butters-Island3-Butters (BIBs). Recombination occurs within two distinct homologous regions that encompass lysin A, lysin B, and holin genes in one segment, and RecE and RecT genes in the other. Structural genes of mosaic BIB genomes are contributed by Butters while the immunity cassette is derived from Island3. Consequently, BIBs are morphologically identical to Butters (as shown by transmission electron microscopy) but are homoimmune with Island3. A reverse experiment where an Island3 lysogen was infected with Butters yielded Butters phages and no recombinants, demonstrating directionality to the recombination phenomenon. Recombinant phages overcome antiphage defense and silencing of the lytic cycle. We leverage this observation to propose a stratagem to generate novel phages for therapeutic use.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520664v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19a817dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ab5f65org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1041cc0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fbb92a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The maximum velocity (Vmax) of catalysis and the substrate concentration ([ST]) at half the Vmax, the KM, are regarded as steady-state (SS) parameters even though they are the outcomes of zero-order kinetics (ZOK). The research was aimed at disputing such a claim with the following objectives: To: 1) carry out an overview of issues pertaining to the validity of assumptions; 2) derive the needed steady-state (SS) equations distinct from Michaelian equations that can be fitted to both experimental variables and kinetic parameters; 3) calculate the SS first-order rate constant for the dissociation of enzyme-substrate complex (ES) to free substrate, S and enzyme, E; 4) derive the equation of rate constant as a function of the reciprocal of the duration of each catalytic event in the reaction pathway. The experimental values of the data were generated by Bernfeld and Lineweaver-Burk methods. The calculated SS 1st order-order rate constant was << the zero-order Michaelian value, and the difference is {approx} 97.59 % of the zero-order value; the SS catalytic rate differed from the zero-order catalytic rate by {approx} 76.41 % of the latter value; and it was {approx} 93.87 % with respect to the 2nd order rate constant for the formation of enzyme-substrate complex. The equations of time-dependent rate constants, KM, and dissociation constants were derived. The concentration [ST] of the S must be > the concentration ([E0]) of the E for the quasi-steady-state assumption (or approximation) to hold. The SS kinetic parameters are not equivalent to zero-order parameters.",

We conducted validation experiments with the UP.SIGHT (CYTENA GmbH) to determine this instruments single-cell dispensing efficiency (SCDE) and probability of clonal derivation (p(clonal)). Process optimization to maximize clone recovery with several cell lines was also performed, focusing on cloning media and plate type.

Addressing these limitations, nanopores can now be analysed using the functional nanopore (FuN) screen exploiting genetically-encoded fluorescent protein sensors that resolve distinct nanopore-dependent Ca2+ in- and efflux patterns across the inner membrane of Escherichia coli. With a primary proof-of-concept established for the S2168 holin, and thereof based recombinant nanopore assemblies, the question arises to what extent alternative nanopores can be analysed with the FuN screen. Focussing on self-assembling membrane peptides, three sets of 13 different nanopores are assessed for their capacity to form nanopores in the context of the FuN screen. Nanopores tested comprise both natural and computationally-designed nanopores while a comparison with high-resolution biophysical studies provides an experimental benchmark for future studies.",

    "abstract": "Interpreting data using mechanistic mathematical models provides a foundation for discovery and decision-making in all areas of science and engineering. Developing mechanistic insight by combining mathematical models and experimental data is especially critical in mathematical biology as new data and new types of data are collected and reported. Key steps in using mechanistic mathematical models to interpret data include: (i) identifiability analysis; (ii) parameter estimation; and (iii) model prediction. Here we present a systematic, computationally-efficient workflow we call Profile-Wise Analysis (PWA) that addresses all three steps in a unified way. Recently-developed methods for constructing  profile-wise prediction intervals enable this workflow and provide the central linkage between different workflow components. These methods propagate profile-likelihood-based confidence sets for model parameters to predictions in a way that isolates how different parameter combinations affect model predictions. We show how to extend these profile-wise prediction intervals to two-dimensional interest parameters. We then demonstrate how to combine profile-wise prediction confidence sets to give an overall prediction confidence set that approximates the full likelihood-based prediction confidence set well. Our three case studies illustrate practical aspects of the workflow, focusing on ordinary differential equation (ODE) mechanistic models with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise models. While the case studies focus on ODE-based models, the workflow applies to other classes of mathematical models, including partial differential equations and simulation-based stochastic models.

Sequence based effector comparisons between pathogens and symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi are hampered by the huge diversity of effector sequences even within closely related microbes.\n\nHere we used a systematic protein structure modelling approach to classify the secretome of the AM fungus Rhizophagus irregularis. We identified secreted proteins with high structural similarity to Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici dual domain (FOLD) effectors, which occur in low numbers in fungal pathogen genomes. Contrastingly, genes encoding FOLD proteins from AM fungi (MycFOLDs) are found in enlarged and diversified gene families.\n\nOur structure-model comparison suggests that MycFOLDs are similar to carbohydrate binding motifs. Different MycFOLD genes are expressed during colonisation of different hosts and MycFOLD-17 transcripts accumulate in plant intracellular arbuscules.\n\nThe exclusive presence of MycFOLDs across unrelated plant-colonising fungi, their inducible expression, lineage specific sequence diversification, and transcripts in arbuscules support the hypothesis that FOLD proteins act as effectors during plant colonisation by symbiotic and pathogenic fungi.",

Bullet-shaped viral particles are unique morphological characteristics of rhabdoviruses; however, the involvement of host factors in rhabdovirus infection, and specifically the molecular mechanisms underlying virion formation are not fully understood. In the present study, we used a siRNA screening approach and found that the ESCRT-I component TSG101 contributes to the propagation of rabies virus (RABV). We demonstrated that the matrix protein (M) of RABV interacts with TSG101 via the late-domain containing the PY and YL motifs, which are conserved in various viral proteins. Loss of the YL motif in the RABV M or the downregulation of host TSG101 expression resulted in the intracellular aggregation of viral proteins and abnormal virus particle formation, indicating a defect in the RABV assembly and budding processes. These results indicate that the interaction of the RABV M and TSG101 is pivotal for not only the efficient budding of progeny RABV from infected cells but also for the bullet-shaped virion morphology.\n\nImportanceEnveloped-viruses bud from cells with the host lipid bilayer. Generally, the membrane modulation and abscission are mediated by host ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport) complexes. Some enveloped-viruses utilize their late (L)-domain to interact with ESCRTs, which promotes viral budding. Rhabdoviruses form characteristic bullet-shaped enveloped-virions, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. Herein, we showed that TSG101, one of ESCRT components, supports rabies virus (RABV) budding and proliferation. TSG101 interacted with RABV matrix protein via L-domain, and the absence of this interaction resulted in intracellular virion accumulation and distortion of the morphology of progeny virions. Our study reveals that virion formation of RABV is highly regulated by TSG101 and the virus matrix protein.",

    "abstract": "The brain is the most complex organ in mammals and understanding the origin of this complexity is a major challenge for developmental biologists. Crucial to the size and morphology of the cortex is the timing and transition of neural stem cell (NSC) fate. An interesting candidate for modulating and fine tuning these processes is the transcriptional regulator Ski, a protooncogene expressed in cortical cells. Ski is involved in diverse cellular processes and epigenetic programs, and mice deficient in Ski exhibit complex central nervous system defects that resemble some of the features observed in patients with 1p36 deletion syndrome and Shprintzen-Goldberg syndrome. Here, we took advantage of in vivo transgenic labeling and next-generation sequencing to analyze the gene expression profiles of NSCs, basal progenitor (BP) cells, and newborn neurons (NBNs) from wildtype and Ski-deficient embryos throughout cortical development. We created a unique database that allowed us to identify and compare signaling pathways and transcriptional networks within each progenitor population in the presence and absence of Ski. We find that NSCs are the most affected cell population and uncover that mutant NSCs fail to switch to a gliogenic fate in time. We show that Ski functions in concert with the Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) signaling pathway to alter the cell differentiation fate of NSCs from neurons to glia, which is key to generating adequate numbers of specific cell types during corticogenesis. Thus, by combining genetic tools and bioinformatic analysis, our work not only deepens the knowledge of how Ski functions in the brain, but also provides an immense resource for studying neurodevelopmental disorders.",

    "abstract": "The rich repertoire of skilled mammalian behavior is the product of neural circuits that generate robust and flexible patterns of activity distributed across populations of neurons. Decades of associative studies have linked many behaviors to specific patterns of population activity, but association alone cannot reveal the dynamical mechanisms that shape those patterns. Are local neural circuits high-dimensional dynamical reservoirs able to generate arbitrary superpositions of patterns with appropriate excitation? Or might circuit dynamics be shaped in response to behavioral context so as to generate only the low-dimensional patterns needed for the task at hand? Here, we address these questions within primate motor cortex by delivering optogenetic and electrical microstimulation perturbations during reaching behavior. We develop a novel analytic approach that relates measured activity to theoretically tractable, dynamical models of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. This computational model captures the dynamical effects of these perturbations and demonstrates that motor cortical activity during reaching is shaped by a self-contained, low-dimensional dynamical system. The subspace containing task-relevant dynamics proves to be oriented so as to be robust to strong non-normal amplification within cortical circuits. This task dynamics space exhibits a privileged causal relationship with behavior, in that stimulation in motor cortex perturb reach kinematics only to the extent that it alters neural states within this subspace. Our results resolve long-standing questions about the dynamical structure of cortical activity associated with movement, and illuminate the dynamical perturbation experiments needed to understand how neural circuits throughout the brain generate complex behavior.",

    "abstract": "Grapheme-colour synaesthetes experience an anomalous form of perception in which graphemes systematically induce specific colour concurrents in their minds eye (\"associator\" type). Although grapheme-colour synaesthesia has been well characterized behaviourally, its neural mechanisms remain largely unresolved. There are currently several competing models, which can primarily be distinguished according to the anatomical and temporal predictions of synaesthesia-inducing neural activity. The first main model (Cross-Activation/ Cascaded Cross-Tuning) posits early recruitment of occipital colour areas in the initial feed-forward sweep of brain activity. The second (Disinhibited Feedback) posits: (i) later involvement of a multisensory convergence zone (for example, in parietal cortices) after graphemes have been processed in their entirety; and (ii) subsequent feedback to early visual areas (i.e., occipital colour areas). In this study, we examine both the timing and anatomical correlates of associator grapheme-colour synaesthetes (n=6) using MEG. Using unbiased analysis methods with little a priori assumptions, we applied Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on a single-subject level to identify the dominant patterns of the induced, synaesthetic percept. We observed evoked activity that significantly dissociates between synaesthesia-inducing and non-inducing conditions at approximately 190 ms following grapheme presentation. This effect is present in grapheme-colour synaesthetes, but not in matched controls, and exhibits an occipito-parietal topology localised consistently across individuals to extrastriate visual cortices and to superior parietal lobes. Due to the observed timing of this evoked activity and its localisation, our results support a model predicting relatively late synaesthesia-inducing activity, more akin to the Disinhibited Feedback model. In light of previous findings, our study suggest that differential timing and neural mechanisms may account for associator grapheme-colour synaesthetes, as compared to projectors.\n\nHighlights- first MEG study to-date examining associator grapheme-colour synaesthetes\n- we use single-subj.

    "abstract": "Episodic memory depends on the association of diverse attribute representations that are distributed across the neocortex, and evidence suggests that these attributes are linked, at least initially, by the hippocampus, which orchestrates retrieval and the offline replay of experience during memory consolidation. The dynamics that characterize this hippocampal-cortical dialogue, however, are only partly understood. Although it was originally proposed that replay is initiated in CA3, with the spontaneous emission of sharp-wave ripple (SWR) bursts, increasing evidence suggests that cortex may seed the process with partial information, leading to pattern completion in CA3 and subsequent global reactivation of the episode. A recent study has shown that the secondary motor cortex (M2), among other areas, carries two distinct types of representations: place cell-like activity, which relies on an intact hippocampus for its development, and responses tied to visuo-tactile cues -- the  attributes of the experience, which do not require the hippocampus. Using two-photon Ca2+ imaging, while simultaneously acquiring LFP from the ipsilateral CA1, we assessed the interactions among cortical retrieval of visuo-tactile attributes of previous experiences in a virtual environment, hippocampal SWR, and the cortical reinstatement of the spatial aspects of the same experiences. During rest after the experience, two types of reactivation events occurred, which separately conveyed information about spatial trajectories and visuo-tactile attributes. Reactivation of attribute information preceded that of trajectories in relation to hippocampal SWRs. Furthermore, paired reactivations of cue and trajectory information supported similar features of previous experiences. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cortical retrieval of non-spatial attributes of recent experience seeds hippocampal reactivation of associated spatial sequences, which is followed by retrieval of episodic memory traces.",

    "abstract": "* AbstractAssessment of the functionality of individual microRNA/target sites is a crucial issue. Genome editing techniques should theoretically permit a fine functional exploration of such interactions, allowing the mutation of microRNAs or individual binding sites in a complete in vivo setting, therefore abrogating or restoring individual interactions on demand. A major limitation to this experimental strategy is the influence of microRNA sequence on its accumulation level, which introduces a confounding effect when assessing phenotypic rescue by compensatorily mutated microRNA and target site. Here we describe a simple assay to identify microRNA variants most likely to accumulate at wild-type levels even though their sequence has been mutated. In this assay, quantification of a reporter construct in cultured cells predicts the efficiency of an early biogenesis step, the Drosha-dependent cleavage of microRNA precursors, which appears to be a major determinant of microRNA accumulation in our variant collection. This system allowed the generation of a mutant Drosophila strain expressing a bantam microRNA variant at wild-type levels.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypes are partly shaped by the environment, which can impact both short-term adaptation and long-term evolution. In dioecious species, the two sexes may exhibit different degrees of phenotypic plasticity and theoretical models indicate that such differences may confer an adaptive advantage when the population is subject to directional selection, either because of a systematically varying environment or of a load of deleterious mutations. The effect stems from the fundamental asymmetry between the two sexes: female fertility is more limited than male fertility. Whether this asymmetry is sufficient for sexual dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity to evolve is, however, not obvious. Here, we show that even in conditions where it provides an adaptive advantage, dimorphic phenotypic plasticity may be evolutionarily unstable due to sexual selection. This is the case, in particular, for panmictic populations where mating partners are formed at random. However, we show that the effects of sexual selection can be counteracted when mating occurs within groups of related individuals. Under this condition, sexual dimorphism in phenotypic plasticity can not only evolve but offset the twofold cost of males. We demonstrate these points with a simple mathematical model through a combination of analytical and numerical results.",

    "abstract": "Moving in synchrony to external rhythmic stimuli is an elementary function that humans regularly engage in. It is termed \"sensorimotor synchronization\" and it is governed by two main parameters, the period and the phase of the movement with respect to the external rhythm. There has been an extensive body of research on the characteristics of these parameters, primarily once the movement synchronization has reached a steady-state level. Particular interest has been shown about how these parameters are corrected when there are deviations for the steady-state level. However, little is known about the initial \"tuning-in\" interval, when one aligns the movement to the external rhythm from rest. The current work investigates this \"tuning-in\" period for each of the four limbs and makes various novel contributions in the understanding of sensorimotor synchronization. The results suggest that phase and period alignment appear to be separate processes. Phase alignment involves limb-specific somatosensory memory in the order of minutes while period alignment has very limited memory usage. Phase alignment is the primary task but then the brain switches to period alignment where it spends most its resources. In overall this work suggests a central, cognitive role of period alignment and a peripheral, sensorimotor role of phase alignment.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIn the tuning-in phase there are three distinct temporal scales of sensorimotor synchronization with distinct signatures. A long-range, across-blocks monotonic negative gradient to more anticipatory movement, which prevails for tens of minutes, a very consistent \"hook\"-shaped pattern within each block, in the range of seconds, and a constant difference across time between feet and hands.\nC_LIO_LIThe across-blocks, monotonic, negative gradient to more anticipatory movement is instantiated only in the first anticipatory trial of each block and the rest of the subsequent block trials contribute to the alignment of the inter-movement interval to the metronomes period.\nC_LIO_LIThis negative asynchrony gradient is limb-specific and is not affected by the interleaved blocks of other limbs.\nC_LIO_LIPeriod alignment has a central, cognitive role while phase alignment a peripheral, sensorimotor role.\nC_LI",
