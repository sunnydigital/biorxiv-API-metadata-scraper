    "abstract": "Medical implants offer a unique and powerful therapeutic approach in many areas of medicine. However, their lifetime is often limited as they may cause a foreign body reaction (FBR) leading to their encapsulation by scar tissue1-4. Despite the importance of this process, how cells recognise implanted materials is still poorly understood5, 6.\n\nHere, we show how the mechanical mismatch between implants and host tissue leads to FBR. Fibroblasts and macrophages, which are both crucially involved in mediating FBR, became activated when cultured on materials just above the stiffness of healthy tissue. Coating stiff implants with a thin layer of hydrogel or silicone with a tissue-like elastic modulus ([~]20 kPa in subcutaneous and [~]2 kPa in peripheral nerve implants) or softer significantly reduced inflammation and fibrosis three months after implantation. Materials stiffer than the host tissue led to nuclear localisation of the mechanosensitive transcriptional regulator YAP in neighbouring cells in vivo, confirming mechanotransduction. The alleviation of FBR by soft coatings not exceeding the stiffness of the host tissue provides a strategy to achieve long-term implant stability without extensive modification of current implant manufacturing techniques, facilitating clinical translation.",

    "abstract": "Pooled variant expression libraries can test the phenotypes of thousands of variants of a gene in a single multiplexed experiment. In a library encoding all single-amino-acid substitutions of a protein, each variant differs from its reference only at a single codon-position located anywhere along the coding sequence. Consequently, accurately identifying these variants by sequencing is a major technical challenge. A popular but expensive brute-force approach is to divide the pool of variants into multiple smaller sub-libraries that each contains variants of a small region and that must each be constructed and screened individually, but that can then be PCR-amplified and fully sequenced with a single read to allow direct readout of variant abundance. Here we present an approach to screen very large variant libraries with mutations spanning a wide region in a single pool, including library design criteria and mutant-detection algorithms that permit reliable calling and counting of variants from large-scale sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has established itself as the golden standard for studying human brain structure. As a result, it has become increasingly more important to identify technical and physiological factors that may influence study outcomes and contribute to misleading conclusions. This work set out to investigate and compare the variability in voxel-based morphometry (VBM) associated with data quality and time-of-day (TOD) when images are collected using a large longitudinal dataset (N = 72). To test the replicability of the results connected to each factor, the analyses were conducted in two comparable cohorts (each N = 36). The replicated TOD differences were further tested for their correlation with indices of sleep. We report that TOD is a significant and partially replicable predictor of the variability in VBM with the magnitude of the observed differences regionally connected to sleep length. Although data quality also has a prevalent impact on VBM, the affected areas were inconsistent across the two datasets. Interestingly, certain overlapping regions were identified in both analyses, showing that longitudinal results could be misattributed to image quality unless this factor is accounted for. All in all, both TOD and data quality are crucial variables to be considered and controlled for at the stage of experimental planning, as well as data acquisition and analysis. Inclusion of these parameters in the study designs can greatly improve the reliability and replicability of the reported MRI results.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphSelective proton transport through proteins is essential for forming and utilizing proton gradients in cells. Protons are conducted along hydrogen-bonded \"wires\" of water molecules and polar sidechains, which, somewhat surprisingly, are often interrupted by dry apolar stretches in the conduction pathways inferred from static protein structures. We hypothesize that protons are conducted through such dry spots by forming transient water wires, often highly correlated with the presence of the excess proton itself in the water wire. To test this hypothesis, we used molecular dynamics simulations to design transmembrane channels with stable water pockets interspersed by apolar segments capable of forming flickering water wires. The minimalist designed channels conduct protons at rates similar to viral proton channels, and they are at least 106-fold more selective for H+ over Na+. These studies inform mechanisms of biological proton conduction and principles for engineering proton-conductive materials.",

Here, we present the \"phylogenetic completeness\" (PC) a concept and methodology that intends to safeguard Earths evolutionary heritage by maintaining all branches of the tree of life. We performed a global evaluation of the PC approach using data from five major terrestrial clades and compared the results to an approach in which species are conserved or lost randomly. We demonstrate that under PC, for a given number of species extinctions, it is possible to maximize the protection of evolutionary innovations in every clade. The PC approach is flexible and can be used to conduct a phylogenetic audit of biodiversity under different conservation scenarios. The PC approach complements existing conservation efforts and is linked to the post-2020 Convention of Biodiversity targets.",

These models are implemented as a static website without the use of a dedicated server or cloud computing. Web-based models like this allow for accessible and effective reproducibility. Most existing approaches rely on third-party servers typically that require upkeep and maintenance. That trend leads to a relatively longer lifetime of web-based models. These predictive models do not require servers, require no installation of dependencies, and work on across a range of devices. The models are bidirectional recurrent neural networks.

We employ the reaction-diffusion framework to compare the data-deduced two-point correlation function and the corresponding spatial power spectral distribution with the theoretically predicted ones. A single histopathological slice suffices to characterize the reaction-diffusion equation dynamics through its power spectral density giving us an interpretative key in terms of infiltration and diffusion of cancer on a per-patient basis.

    "abstract": "HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) are able to suppress viremia and prevent infection. Their induction by vaccination is therefore a major goal. However, in contrast to antibodies that neutralize other pathogens, HIV-1-specific bNAbs frequently carry uncommon molecular characteristics that might prevent their induction. Here, we performed unbiased sequence analyses of B cell receptor repertoires from 57 healthy and 46 chronically HIV-1- or HCV-infected individuals and learned probabilistic models to predict the likelihood of bNAb development. We formally show that lower probabilities for bNAbs are predictive of higher HIV-1 neutralization activity. Moreover, ranking of bNAbs by their probabilities allowed to identify highly potent antibodies with superior generation probabilities as preferential targets for vaccination approaches. Importantly, we found equal bNAb probabilities across infected and healthy donors. This implies that chronic infection is not a prerequisite for the generation of bNAbs, fostering the hope that HIV-1 vaccines can induce bNAb development in healthy individuals.\n\nSignificance StatementWhile HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) can develop in chronically HIV-1-infected individuals, they could not yet be elicited by active vaccination. Here, we computationally demonstrate that HIV-1 bNAbs carry distinct sequence features making them unlikely outcomes of the antibody evolution. However, our approach allowed us to identify bNAbs with higher probabilities of being generated. These candidates can now serve as the most promising targets to be induced by vaccination. Moreover, we show that chronic infection has no influence on the probabilities of finding typical bNAb sequence features in the memory B cell compartment. Both findings are critical to design effective vaccination strategies.",

We present a light-sheet microscopy prototype, the cleared-tissue dual view Selective Plane Illumination Microscope (ct-dSPIM), capable of fast, 3D high-resolution acquisitions, of cubic centimetre sized cleared tissue. We used Mosaic scans for fast 3D overview scans of entire tissue samples or higher resolution overviews of large ROIs with various speeds: a) Mosaic 16 (16.4 {micro}m isotropic resolution, [~] 1.7 hr/cm3), b) Mosaic 4 (4.1 {micro}m isotropic resolution, [~] 5 hr/cm3) and c) Mosaic 0.5 (0.5 {micro}m near isotropic resolution, [~]15.8 hr/cm3). We could visualise ROIs around the border of human brain area V1/V2, and could demonstrate suitable imaging quality for Gleason score grading in prostate cancer samples.

    "abstract": "Due to a lack of spatial-temporal resolution at the single cell level, the etiologies of the bone dysfunction caused by diseases such as normal aging, osteoporosis, and the metabolic bone disease associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain largely unknown. To this end, flow cytometry and scRNAseq were performed on long bone cells from Sost-cre/Ai9+ mice, and pure osteolineage transcriptomes were identified, including novel osteocyte-specific gene sets. Clustering analysis isolated osteoblast precursors that expressed Tnc, Mmp13, and Spp1, and a mature osteoblast population defined by Smpd3, Col1a1, and Col11a1. Osteocytes were demarcated by Cd109, Ptprz1, Ramp1, Bambi, Adamts14, Spns2, Bmp2, WasI, and Phex. We validated our in vivo scRNAseq using integrative in vitro promoter occupancy via ATACseq coupled with transcriptomic analyses of a conditional, temporally differentiated MSC cell line. Further, trajectory analyses predicted osteoblast-to-osteocyte transitions via defined pathways associated with a distinct metabolic shift as determined by single-cell flux estimation analysis (scFEA). Using the adenine mouse model of CKD, at a time point prior to major skeletal alterations, we found that gene expression within all stages of the osteolineage was disturbed. In sum, distinct populations of osteoblasts/osteocytes were defined at the single cell level. Using this roadmap of gene assembly, we demonstrated unrealized molecular defects across multiple bone cell populations in a mouse model of CKD, and our collective results suggest a potentially earlier and more broad bone pathology in this disease than previously recognized.",

    "abstract": "The p63 transcription factor is critical for epidermis formation in embryonic development, but its role in the adult epidermis is poorly understood. Here we show that acute genetic ablation of {Delta}Np63, the main p63 isoform, in adult epidermis disrupts keratinocyte proliferation and self-maintenance and, unexpectedly, triggers an inflammatory psoriasis-like condition. Mechanistically, single-cell RNA sequencing revealed down-regulation of the cell cycle genes, up-regulation of differentiation markers, and induction of several pro-inflammatory pathways in {Delta}Np63-ablated keratinocytes. Intriguingly, {Delta}Np63-ablated cells disappear three weeks post-ablation, at the expense of the remaining non-ablated cells. This is not associated with active cell death mechanisms, but rather with reduced self-maintenance capacity. Indeed, in vivo wound healing assay, a physiological readout of the epidermal stem cell function, is severely impaired in {Delta}Np63-ablated mice. We found that the Wnt signaling pathway (Wnt10a, Fzd6, Fzd10) and the AP1 factors (JunB, Fos, FosB) are the likely {Delta}Np63 effectors responsible for keratinocyte proliferation/stemness and suppression of differentiation, respectively, while interleukins IL-1a, IL-18, IL-24, and IL-36{gamma} are the likely negative effectors responsible for the suppression of inflammation. These data establish {Delta}Np63 as a critical node that coordinates epidermal homeostasis, stemness, and suppression of inflammation in the adult epidermis, upstream of known regulatory pathways.",

These graphs can be transformed through a Graph Convolutional Network to form lower-dimensional embeddings for downstream tasks. On the basis of the gapped pattern graphs, we implemented a neural network model and demonstrated its performance in studying phage sequences. We compared our model with equivalent models based on other forms of input in performing four tasks related to nucleic acid sequences--phage and ICE discrimination, phage integration site prediction, lifestyle prediction, and host prediction. Other state-of-the-art tools were also compared, where available. Our method consistently outperformed all the other methods in various metrics on all four tasks.

    "abstract": "Cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs) represent a diverse population of mainly locally projecting cells that provide specialized forms of inhibition to pyramidal neurons and other INs. Most recent work on INs has focused on subtypes distinguished by expression of Parvalbumin (PV), Somatostatin (SST), or Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP). However, a fourth group that includes neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) has remained enigmatic due to a lack of genetic tools. Here, we show that these INs can be accessed experimentally using intersectional genetics with the gene Id2. We find that outside of layer 1 (L1), the majority of Id2 INs are NGFCs that express high levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and exhibit a late-spiking firing pattern, with extensive local connectivity. While much sparser, non-NGFC Id2 INs had more variable properties, with most cells corresponding to a diverse group of INs that strongly expresses the neuropeptide CCK. In vivo, using silicon probe recordings, we observed several distinguishing aspects of NGFC activity, including a strong rebound in activity immediately following the cortical down state during NREM sleep. Our study provides insights into IN diversity and NGFC distribution and properties, and outlines an intersectional genetics approach for further study of this neglected group of INs.",

Tumors from melanoma patients who responded to ICI or MAPK pathway inhibitors (MAPKi) therapy generally displayed increased T cell infiltration and interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}) pathway activation. Yet, the rate of durable tumor control after ICI is almost twice that of MAPKi. Comparing the transcriptome of cohorts of melanoma patients treated with ICI or MAPKi therapy, we discovered that response to ICI is associated with CXCL13-driven recruitment of CXCR5+ B cells with higher clonal diversity than MAPKi. Higher B cell receptor (BCR) diversity allows presentation of diverse tumor antigens by B cells, resulting in robust increases of IFN{gamma} pathway activity and CXCL13 expression in tumor reactive CD8 T cells after ICI therapy. Accordingly, ICI-treated melanoma patients, but not MAPKi, whose tumors displayed higher BCR diversity and IFN{gamma} pathway score, survived significantly longer than those with either one or none. Thus, response to ICI, but not to MAPKi therapy, induces the recruitment of clonally diverse antigen presenting B cells that activate tumor specific, cytotoxic CD8 T cells to effect a durable antitumor immune response. Our result suggests that enhancing B cells tumor antigen presentation to intratumoral CD8 T cells can increase the rate of long-term response to ICI therapy.",

    "abstract": "Chemical sensing via olfaction constitutes a most ancient form of inter-organism communication. But acoustical signaling via tonal and rhythmic patterning is also common among higher vertebrates. Animals that live in well ventilated habitats and move in diasporic ways have further evolved more spectrally varied and discretized call structure. But unlike song in birds, researchers have struggled to locate isolated nucleii specialized for music cognition. The brain stem, midbrain, hindbrain, and forebrain, however, all largely associate with aspects of musical performance, perception, memory, and emotion. I hypothesized that spectral features of musical display evolved as honest signals of spatial cognition for precarious locomotor tasks associated with nurturing and protecting vulnerable offspring. I investigated possible connections between motor, visual, and spatial cognitive areas in relation to both signaler production and receiver processing of acoustical features of musical output. Brain component volume fractions of 42 parts from 48 primates were compiled, from a single source, and compared against a vocal complexity index (ARDI) as well as individual musical feature scores: including tone, interval, repetition, transposition rhythm, and unique syllable count. Structures for spatial and visual perception as well as motor control and emotional processing associated moderately with areas used by species who produce calls with both temporal and spectral musical features. These findings are consistent with a dual (both receiver- and signaler-side) function of musical signals. Associations with spatio-social areas (e.g. schizocortex and insula) support direct selection for a paralimbic-based neighbor orienting [PIANO] sensory modality for mapping and anticipating movement of fellow arboreal cohabitants. Associations with motor areas (e.g. LGN, mid-brain, and thalamus) support the complementary model that signaler capacities for spatio-motive emplacement [ME] are indirectly selected by conspecific receivers. This dual manifestation in low-parity species that locomote in diasporic ways through (arboreally) diffuse habitats, is compatible with musicality serving as courtship signals by long-term mates with consistent and reliable spatial capacities directly relevant to care of vulnerable (arboreal) offspring.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo develop a typology of poor peer review practices (PPRP) and assess researchers experiences with PPRP.\n\nDesignExploratory analysis of cross-sectional internet-based survey.\n\nParticipantsWe solicited 500 researchers funded by the NIH extramural grants in 2018 by direct email and 600 bioethicists on a bioethics discussion forum (mcw.bioethics). 112 respondents (~10%) completed the survey.\n\nPrimary and Secondary Outcomes MeasuresThe total number of reported PPRP and a five-point scale to assess participants views about the effect of PPRP on their ability to disseminate their research.\n\nResultsThe mean number of PPRP experienced per author was 12.5 of 28 (44.6%; range 0-27; 95% CI = 11.2-13.8), with fourteen PPRP experienced by 50% or more of the sample. The number of reported PPRP increased with age (P = 0.01) and total number of published peer-reviewed manuscripts (P = 0.02). Authors belonging to underrepresented groups reported more PPRP compared to represented groups (P = 0.05). Most authors viewed the peer review process favorably, with 67% (74/111) of authors responding \"sometimes\" or \"often\" to having received insightful peer reviews that improved the quality of their final papers. However, a total of 57% (63/111) of respondents admitted to previously abandoning a manuscript after receiving what they perceived to be unfair peer reviews.\n\nConclusionsThis study introduces a practical list of PPRP and a framework for a typology of PPRP, which could serve as an educational tool for editors and reviewers and further our understanding of poor peer review practices. Future researchers will expand authors experiences with constructive or helpful peer review practices.\n\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDYO_LIThe sample consisted primarily of experienced researchers from diverse fields, which aided in capturing a wide variety of poor peer review examples.\nC_LIO_LIThis survey included a core set of 28 poor peer review practices and allowed respondents to add other practices they had experienced, which helped to generate an extensive list of poor peer review practices.\nC_LIO_LIThe generalizability of the prevalence of poor review types and the degree of negative impact on authors should be interpreted with caution due to the low response rate and the potential for response bias.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The coadaptation or genetic coupling of senders and receivers of sex signals in some animals has been described, but no empirical evidence shows whether sex pheromones and their receptors undergo coadaptation in mammals. In this study of the brown rat (Rattus norvegicus), we found markedly higher levels of two predominant male pheromones (2-heptanone and MUP13) in the North China subspecies [R. n. humiliatus (RNH)] than in the Northeast China subspecies [R. n. caraco (RNC)] by gas or liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. Coincidently, two vomeronasal receptor genes (Vom1r68 and Vom2r53) were found to be expressed at higher levels in RNH females than in RNC females and were thus considered candidate receptors for 2-heptanone and MUP13, respectively. An immunofluorescence analysis showed that these two VR receptors colocalized with mTmG on the membrane of HEK293-T cells. We also verified the responsiveness of Vom1r68 to 2-heptanone and Vom2r53 to MUP13 in HEK293-T cells by calcium imaging. In conclusion, we screened and identified the receptors of two pheromones based on the coadaptation of pheromones and their receptors, which further verified their coevolution.",

    "abstract": "Larval eastern oysters (Crassostrea virginica) grown in shellfish hatcheries are susceptible to bacterial diseases, particularly vibriosis. Probiotics are microbes that confer health benefits to the host and have been identified as promising tools to manage diseases in aquaculture. The marine bacterium Phaeobacter inhibens S4 (S4) protects larval eastern oysters against challenge with the bacterial pathogen Vibrio coralliilyticus RE22 (RE22). A concentrated liquid formulation of probiont S4 that maintained high cell viability after long-term storage was developed for commercial use in shellfish hatcheries. The safety and efficacy of the formulation was tested in six different trials in two hatcheries. The S4 formulation was added to C. virginica larvae culture tanks daily at 104 colony forming units (CFU)/mL from day 1 post fertilization until day 6, 12, or 14, depending on the trial. Treatment of larvae in the hatchery with the S4 formulation did not significantly affect the survival and growth of the larvae. Formulated probiont S4 treatment in the hatchery led to a significant increase in Relative Percent Survival (RPS) when larvae were subsequently challenged with the pathogen RE22 (105 CFU/mL) for 24 hours in a laboratory challenge, as compared to probiotic-untreated RE22-challenged larvae (Relative Percent Survival increase of 46 - 74%, p < 0.05). These results suggest that this novel S4 formulation is a safe, easy to use, and effective tool in preventing larval losses due to vibriosis in hatcheries.",

    "abstract": "The gut viral community has been linked to human physiology and health, but our knowledge of its genetic and functional contents and disease dependence is far from complete. Here, we collected 11,327 bulk or viral metagenomes from fecal samples from large-scale Chinese populations to establish a Chinese gut virus catalogue (cnGVC) comprising 67,096 nonredundant viral genomes. This catalogue included [~]70% of novel viruses that are not represented in existing gut viral databases, and allowed us to characterize the functional diversity and specificity of the gut virome. Using cnGVC, we 1) profiled the gut virome in large-scale populations and evaluated their sex- and age-related variations, 2) investigated the diversity and compositional patterns of the gut virome across common diseases by analyzing 6,314 bulk metagenomes spanning 28 disease or unhealthy statuses, and 3) identified a large number of universal viral signatures of diseases and validated their predictive ability for health status. Overall, our resources and results would contribute to the grand effort of expanding the knowledge of the human gut virome and addressing a full picture of the associations between viruses and common diseases.",

    "abstract": "Emm1 Streptococcus pyogenes is a successful, globally-distributed epidemic clone that is regarded as inherently invasive. An emm1 sublineage, M1UK, that expresses increased SpeA toxin, was associated with increased scarlet fever and invasive infections in England in 2015/2016. Defined by 27 SNPs in the core genome, M1UK is now dominant in England. To more fully characterise M1UK, we undertook comparative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of M1UK and contemporary non-M1UK emm1 strains (M1global).\n\nJust seven genes were differentially expressed by M1UK compared with contemporary M1global strains. In addition to speA, five genes in the operon that includes glycerol dehydrogenase were upregulated in M1UK (gldA, mipB/talC, pflD, and pts system IIC and IIB components), while aquaporin (glpF2) was downregulated. M1UK strains have a stop codon in gldA. Deletion of the gldA gene in M1global abrogated glycerol dehydrogenase activity, and recapitulated upregulation of gene expression within the operon that includes gldA, consistent with a feedback effect.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis identified two intermediate emm1 sublineages in England comprising 13/27 (M113SNPs) and 23/27 SNPs (M123SNPs) respectively, that had failed to expand in the population. Proteomic analysis of these four major phylogenetic emm1 groups highlighted sublineage-specific changes in carbohydrate metabolism, protein synthesis and protein processing; upregulation of SpeA was not observed in chemically-defined medium. In rich broth however, transcription and secretion of SpeA was upregulated ~10-fold in both M123SNPs and M1UK sublineages, compared with M113SNPs and M1global.\n\nWe conclude that stepwise accumulation of SNPs led to the emergence of M1UK. While increased expression of SpeA is a key indicator of M1UK and undoubtedly important, M1UK strains have outcompeted M123SNPs and other emm types that produce similar or more superantigen toxin. We speculate that an accumulation of adaptive SNPs has contributed to a wider fitness advantage in M1UK on an inherently successful emm1 streptococcal background.\n\nData availabilityRNAseq.

Emm1 S. pyogenes strains are the single most frequent genotype to cause invasive infections in high income countries and are established worldwide as an epidemic clone. The M1UK S. pyogenes emm1 sublineage which is defined by 27 new SNPs in the core genome, and characterised by increased scarlet fever toxin SpeA production, emerged and rose to dominance over a period of 5-6 years since initial recognition, outcompeting other emm1 strains in England. Increased dominance of emm1 among invasive infections this winter, on a background of already-increased numbers of S. pyogenes infections, points to a key shift in host-pathogen interaction. We hypothesize that a combination of pathogen fitness, virulence, and host susceptibility have coalesced to account for the excess of circulating S. pyogenes and emm1 invasive infections. In this paper we undertake a systems-based evaluation of M1UK in comparison to older non-M1UK emm1 strains, and identify a number of pathways that are altered in addition to the previously-reported increased SpeA expression. The emergence of a new sublineage within an already virulent clone requires ongoing surveillance, and more detailed investigation of the likely mechanisms leading to increased fitness. The capacity of S. pyogenes to cause outbreaks at national scale highlights a potential need to consider strain-specific public health guidance, underlining the inherent virulence of this exclusively human pathogen.",
