    "abstract": "Cortical GABAergic interneurons (INs) represent a diverse population of mainly locally projecting cells that provide specialized forms of inhibition to pyramidal neurons and other INs. Most recent work on INs has focused on subtypes distinguished by expression of Parvalbumin (PV), Somatostatin (SST), or Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP). However, a fourth group that includes neurogliaform cells (NGFCs) has remained enigmatic due to a lack of genetic tools. Here, we show that these INs can be accessed experimentally using intersectional genetics with the gene Id2. We find that outside of layer 1 (L1), the majority of Id2 INs are NGFCs that express high levels of neuropeptide Y (NPY) and exhibit a late-spiking firing pattern, with extensive local connectivity. While much sparser, non-NGFC Id2 INs had more variable properties, with most cells corresponding to a diverse group of INs that strongly expresses the neuropeptide CCK. In vivo, using silicon probe recordings, we observed several distinguishing aspects of NGFC activity, including a strong rebound in activity immediately following the cortical down state during NREM sleep. Our study provides insights into IN diversity and NGFC distribution and properties, and outlines an intersectional genetics approach for further study of this neglected group of INs.",

    "abstract": "Here we reveal an unanticipated role of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) in regulating complex social behavior in ants. Using scRNA-seq we find localization in the BBB of a key hormone-degrading enzyme called Juvenile hormone esterase (Jhe), and we show that this localization governs the level of Juvenile Hormone (JH3) entering the brain. Manipulation of the Jhe level reprograms the brain transcriptome between ant castes. While ant Jhe is retained and functions intracellularly within the BBB, we show that Drosophila Jhe is naturally extracellular. Heterologous expression of ant Jhe into the Drosophila BBB alters behavior in fly to mimic what is seen in ant. Most strikingly, manipulation of Jhe levels in ant reprograms complex behavior between worker castes. Our study thus uncovers a novel, potentially conserved role of the BBB serving as a molecular gatekeeper for a neurohormonal pathway that regulates social behavior.",

However, the precise time alignment of data from heterogeneous sources is limited due to variable recording parameters of commercially available research devices and experimental setups. Here, we introduced the versatility of a Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)-based application for multimodal recordings of high-density EEG and other devices such as eye trackers or hand kinematics. To introduce the benefit of recording multiple devices in a time-synchronized manner, we discuss two common issues in measuring multimodal data: jitter and latency. The LSL-based system can be used for research on precise time-alignment of datasets, such as detecting stimulus-induced transient neural responses and testing hypotheses well-formulated in time by leveraging the millisecond time resolution of the system.",

    "abstract": "The nature of eye movements during visual search has been widely studied in psychology and neuroscience. Virtual reality (VR) paradigms provide an opportunity to test whether computational models of search can predict naturalistic search behavior. However, existing ideal observer models are constrained by strong assumptions about the structure of the world, rendering them impractical for modeling the complexity of environments that can be studied in VR. To address these limitations, we frame naturalistic visual search as a problem of allocating limited cognitive resources, formalized as a meta-level Markov decision process (meta-MDP) over a representation of the environment encoded by a deep neural network. We train reinforcement learning agents to solve the meta-MDP, showing that the agents optimal policy converges to a classic ideal observer model of search developed for simplified environments. We compare the learned policy with human gaze data from a visual search experiment conducted in VR, finding a qualitative and quantitative correspondence between model predictions and human behavior. Our results suggest that gaze behavior in naturalistic visual search is consistent with rational allocation of limited cognitive resources.",

    "abstract": "Brain imaging with a high-spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for accurate brain-function mapping. Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) are two popular neuroimaging modalities with complementary features that record brain function with high temporal and spatial resolution, respectively. One popular non-invasive way to obtain data with both high spatial and temporal resolutions is to combine the fMRI activation map and EEG data to improve the spatial resolution of the EEG source localization. However, using the whole fMRI map may cause spurious results for the EEG source localization, especially for deep brain regions. Considering the heads conductivity, deep regions dipoles with low activity are unlikely to be detected by the EEG electrodes at the scalp. In this study, we use fMRIs high spatial-frequency component to identify the local high-intensity activations that are most likely to be captured by the EEG. The 3D Empirical Mode Decomposition (3D-EMD), a data-driven method, is used to decompose the fMRI map into its spatial-frequency components. Different validation measurements for EEG source localization show improved performance for the EEG inverse-modeling informed by the fMRIs high-frequency spatial component compared to the fMRI-informed EEG source-localization methods. The level of improvement varies depending on the voxels intensity and their distribution.",

    "abstract": "General anesthesia (GA) has been under scientific scrutiny since its discovery more than a century ago, resulting in conceptually different proposed mechanisms to explain its origin and operation. Two mechanisms stand out: the lipid and the protein hypothesis. The Meyer-Overton rule (the more anesthetics dissolve in octanol, the greater their action) backups the first hypothesis, while the ligand-receptor interaction, specifically on ion channels, sustains the second. A recent study on Drosophila melanogaster draws attention to the possibility that both paradigms come together to explain GA synergistically, with the important caveat that this hybrid mechanism lies in the existence of lipid rafts in which cholesterol plays an essential role. Using two model organisms, the water flea (D. magna) and the nematode C. elegans, we give a further step to clarify this puzzle by carrying out anesthetic experiments with xenon and nitrous oxide. First, the obtained dose-response curves are very steep, implying that Hill coefficients greater than one are needed to describe them correctly, supporting an unspecific action mechanism. Second, we show that the animals response to both gases is influenced by a cholesterol diet modification, thus proving that this lipid promotes anesthetic induction. Our findings reenforce the idea that GA is driven by an allosteric induction rather than selective actions on single-target receptors.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical models suggest executive functions are supported by both domain-general and domain-specific processes. While some brain imaging studies claim executive tasks recruit a domain-general multiple-demand (MD) brain system, many studies argue the spatially coarse results of traditional imaging methods have blurred fine-grained functionally fractionated domain-specific systems into one. To address this challenge, we scanned participants using the high spatial resolution multimodal MRI approach of the Human Connectome Project while they performed tasks targeting executive demands of updating, shifting and inhibition. The results show that different executive activations overlap, at the single subject level, within MD regions. Critically, each tasks topography shifts within MD regions to form a unique intersection with adjacent fine-grained resting-state networks. In this intersection, the strongest activations arise at neurobiologically defined network borders. Outside cerebral cortex, matching results are seen in circumscribed regions of the caudate nucleus, thalamus and cerebellum. Using precise imaging methods, these results suggest a novel framework whereby partially-specialised networks recruit neighbouring MD areas to generate distinct executive functions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to select between potential actions is central to the complex process of tool use. After left hemisphere stroke, individuals with limb apraxia make more hand action errors when gesturing the use of tools with conflicting hand actions for grasping-to-move and use (e.g., screwdriver) relative to tools that are grasped-to-move and used with the same hand action (e.g., hammer). Prior research indicates that this grasp-use interference effect is driven by abnormalities in the competitive action selection process. The goal of this project was to determine whether common mechanisms and neural substrates support the competitive selection of task-appropriate responses in both tool and non-tool domains. If so, the grasp-use interference effect in a tool use gesturing task should be correlated with response interference effects in the classic Eriksen flanker and Simon tasks, and at least partly overlapping neural regions should subserve the 3 tasks. Sixty-four left hemisphere stroke survivors (33 with apraxia) participated in the tool- and non-tool interference tasks and underwent T1 anatomical MRI. There were robust grasp-use interference effects (grasp-use conflict test) and response interference effects (Eriksen flanker and Simon tasks), but these effects were not correlated. Lesion-symptom mapping analyses showed that lesions to the left inferior parietal lobule, ventral premotor cortex, and insula were associated with grasp-use interference. Lesions to the left inferior parietal lobule, postcentral gyrus, insula, caudate, and putamen were associated with response interference in the Eriksen flanker task. Lesions to the left caudate and putamen were also associated with response interference in the Simon task. Our results suggest that the selection of hand posture for tool use is mediated by distinct cognitive mechanisms and partly distinct neuroanatomic substrates from those mapping a stimulus to an appropriate motor response in non-tool domains.",

    "abstract": "Some neural representations change slowly across multiple timescales. Here we argue that modeling this \"drift\" could help explain the spacing effect (the long-term benefit of distributed learning), whereby differences between stored and current temporal context activity patterns produce greater error-driven learning. We trained a neurobiologically realistic model of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus to learn paired associates alongside temporal context vectors that drifted between learning episodes and/or before final retention intervals. In line with spacing effects, greater drift led to better model recall after longer retention intervals. Dissecting model mechanisms revealed that greater drift increased error-driven learning, strengthened weights in slower-drifting temporal context neurons (temporal abstraction), and improved direct cue-target associations (decontextualization). Intriguingly, these results suggest that decontextualization -- generally ascribed only to the neocortex -- can occur within the hippocampus itself. Altogether, our findings provide a mechanistic formalization for established learning concepts such as spacing effects and errors during learning.",

    "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety and depression can be induced by stress, but not all individuals exposed to stress develop psychopathology. Therefore, probing the neural substrates that underlie trait vulnerability to stress may open the door for preventive approaches that use biological markers to identify at-risk populations. Here, we developed a novel tracing technique to probe local connectivity patterns as predictors of individual variability in stress responses. Specifically, we combined a retrograde transsynaptic rabies tracing system with cFos colocalization immediately after an acute stressor to elucidate local structural and stress-activated (functional) differences in connectivity within the amygdala complex in female and male mice along a spectrum of social approach/avoidance following acute social defeat stress. While we find no structural or functional connections within the amygdala complex as predictors of individual variability in our behavioral readout, our methods provide a novel approach to investigating cellular and behavioral individual variability in stress responses. Furthermore, we identify overall stress-activation as a predictor of social approach/avoidance in two subregions, medial amygdala and piriform-amygdala area, which may serve as potential biological markers of trait vulnerability, with possible clinical applicability.\n\nSignificance StatementExposure to stress is ubiquitous, but the outcomes of stress exposure vary greatly between individuals. Our work introduces a novel tracing technique to probe for structural and functional connectivity patterns across a broad spectrum of behavioral responses to social stress. Utilizing pre-clinical classification in conjunction with representative behavioral classification introduces to the field a mechanism to identify potential clinical targets for preventative screening for neuropsychiatric disorders as well as further individualized treatment. Notably, our work identifies two intra-amygdalar neural correlates of social stress, opening the door for future investigation of the role these regions play in mediating social stress.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 cause Parkinsons disease (PD). The G2019S variant is the most common, which results in abnormally high kinase activity. Compounds that target LRRK2 kinase activity are currently being developed and tested in clinical trials. We recently found that G2019S LRRK2 causes mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) damage and treatment with multiple classes of LRRK2 kinase inhibitors at concentrations associated with dephosphorylation of LRRK2 reversed mtDNA damage to healthy control levels. Because maintaining the normal function of LRRK2 in heterozygous G2019S LRRK2 carriers while specifically targeting the G2019S LRRK2 activity could have an advantageous safety profile, we explored the efficacy of a G2019S mutant selective LRRK2 inhibitor to reverse mtDNA damage in G2019S LRRK2 models and patient cells relative to non-selective LRRK2 inhibitors. Potency of LRRK2 kinase inhibition by EB-42168, a G2019S mutant LRRK2 kinase inhibitor, and MLi-2, a nonselective inhibitor, was determined by measuring phosphorylation of LRRK2 at Ser935 and/or Ser1292 using quantitative western immunoblot analysis. The Mito DNADX assay, a novel system that allows for the accurate real-time quantification of mtDNA damage in a 96-well platform, was performed in parallel. We confirmed that EB-42168 selectively inhibits LRRK2 phosphorylation on G2019S LRRK2 relative to wild-type LRRK2. On the other hand, MLi-2 was equipotent for wild-type and G2019S LRRK2. Acute treatment with EB-42168 inhibited LRRK2 phosphorylation and also restored mtDNA damage to healthy control levels. Precision medicine is a common approach in modern day cancer research that is not yet routinely applied to neurodegenerative diseases. Abrogation of mtDNA damage with mutant selective tool inhibitor EB-42168 demonstrates the promise of a precision medicine approach for LRRK2 G2019S PD. Levels of mtDNA damage may serve as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker of altered kinase activity that could be useful for small molecule development and clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Neural networks encode information through their collective spiking activity in response to external stimuli. This population response is noisy and strongly correlated, with complex interplay between correlations induced by the stimulus, and correlations caused by shared noise. Understanding how these correlations affect information transmission has so far been limited to pairs or small groups of neurons, because the curse of dimensionality impedes the evaluation of mutual information in larger populations. Here we develop a small-correlation expansion to compute the stimulus information carried by a large population of neurons, yielding interpretable analytical expressions in terms of the neurons firing rates and pairwise correlations. We validate the approximation on synthetic data and demonstrate its applicability to electrophysiological recordings in the vertebrate retina, allowing us to quantify the effects of noise correlations between neurons and of memory in single neurons.",

    "abstract": "Oxytocin receptor (OXTR) modulates social behaviors in a species-specific manner. Remarkable inter- and intraspecies variation in brain OXTR distribution are associated with diversity in social behavior. To investigate potential genetic mechanisms underlying the phylogenetic plasticity in brain Oxtr expression and its consequences on social behavior, we constructed BAC transgenic mice harboring the entire prairie vole Oxtr locus with surrounding intergenic regulatory elements. Eight independent \"volized\" (pvOxtr) mouse lines were obtained; remarkably, each line displayed a unique pattern of brain expression distinct from mice and prairie voles. Four pvOxtr lines were selected for further investigation. Despite robust differences in brain expression, Oxtr expression in mammary gland was conserved across lines, suggesting that Oxtr expression in brain, but not mammary gland, is highly sensitive to local chromosomal landscape at integration sites. Moreover, different \"volized\" mouse lines showed differences in partner preference and maternal behaviors. Our results from this cross-species study suggest that species-specific variation in regulatory elements or distribution of transcription factors are not responsible for species-typical brain Oxtr expression patterns. Thus, transcriptional hypersensitivity to surrounding sequence of brain Oxtr may be a key mechanism to generate diversity in brain OXTR distribution and social behaviors. This inherent \"evolvability\" of brain Oxtr expression constitutes a novel transcriptional mechanism to generate variability in neuropeptide receptor distribution which, through natural selection, can generate diversity in adaptive social behaviors while preserving peripheral expression. The \"volized\" Oxtr mouse lines are useful for further understanding OXTR regulation and key neural circuits/networks mediating variability in social behaviors.\n\nSignificance StatementUnlike the essential physiological phenomenon including feeding, sex, parturition and lactation, which are conserved across mammalian species, there is extraordinary diversity of social behaviors between and within species. Comparative studies across species suggest that variation in brain oxytocin receptor expression may mediate diversity in social behavior. Subtle variation in human oxytocin receptor sequence have been related to psychiatric phenotypes. Our studies suggest that the oxytocin receptor gene is hypersensitive to sequence variation at its molecular address which leads to variability in brain expression pattern and social behavior. This research provides new insights into the evolvability of genes producing diversity in social behaviors, which allows efficient adaptation of animals to variable environment and potentially provides insight into psychiatric outcomes related to social behavior.",

    "abstract": "The retina transforms patterns of light into visual feature representations supporting behaviour. These representations are distributed across various types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), whose spatial and temporal tuning properties have been extensively studied in many model organisms, including the mouse. However, it has been difficult to link the potentially nonlinear retinal transformations of natural visual inputs to specific ethological purposes. Here, we discover a novel selectivity to chromatic contrast in an RGC type that allows the detection of transitions of the horizon across a retinal region. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) model on large-scale functional recordings of RGC responses to natural mouse movies, and then used this model to search in silico for stimuli that maximally excite distinct types of RGCs. This procedure predicted centre colour-opponency in transient Suppressed-by-Contrast RGCs (tSbC), a cell type whose function is being debated. We confirmed experimentally that these cells indeed responded very selectively to Green-OFF, UV-ON contrasts, which we found to be characteristic of transitions from ground to sky in the visual scene, as might be elicited by head-or eye-movements across the horizon. Because tSbCs reliably detected these transitions, we suggest a role for this RGC type in providing contextual information (i.e. sky or ground) necessary for the selection of appropriate behavioural responses to other stimuli, such as looming objects. Our work showcases how a combination of experiments with natural stimuli and computational modelling allows discovering novel types of stimulus selectivity and identifying their potential ethological relevance.",

    "abstract": "The Human 1.2-Mb AUTS2 locus on chromosome 7q11.22 encodes a 1259-aa full-length protein, and a 711-aa C-terminal isoform. Functions of these AUTS2 proteins are only partly known. The major traits found in patients displaying AUTS2 locus mutations are Intellectual Disabilities, microcephaly attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (54%), and autistic traits. Furthermore, AUTS2 common variants were recently found associated to alcohol consumption and dyslexia using GWAS approaches. Auts2 localizes mainly in cell nuclei. We evidenced by super-resolution that Auts2 is present in dendritic spines. Auts2 interacts with Ttc3, the Akt2 E3 ligase, and negatively regulates Akt2 ubiquitination. Auts2 haploinsufficiency affects Akt/mTorc1 pathway with a decrease in AMPA and NMDA receptor subunits and in synaptic currents. Akt2 injection in postsynaptic neurons is sufficient to reverse changes in synaptic currents generated by Auts2 haploinsufficiency. Using chromosome engineering based on targeted meiotic recombination, we generated two mouse models with Auts2 locus deletion and duplication. Deleted Auts2 locus mice display stereotypies (rearing), perseveration and abnormal recognition memory. Duplicated Auts2 locus mice display similar perseveration and abnormal recognition memory but also a decrease in cued and contextual fear memory. Gene dosage induce changes in brain sub-region neuronal networks. In the thalamo-lateral amygdala pathway linked to cued fear memory, we found synaptic impairments linked to AMPA receptors, with a specific decrease in pAKT/total AKT ratio in duplicated Auts2 mice. Altogether, our study thereby provides a novel mechanistic and potentially therapeutic understanding of synaptic AKT/mTORC1 deregulated signaling and its related behavioral and cognitive phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Most individuals experience their dominant arm as being more dexterous than the non-dominant arm, but the neural mechanisms underlying this asymmetry in motor behaviour are unclear. Using a delayed reach task, we have recently demonstrated strong goal-directed tuning of stretch reflex gains in the dominant upper limb of human participants. Here, we used an equivalent experimental paradigm to address the neural mechanisms that underlie the preparation for reaching movements with the non-dominant upper limb. We found only minor goal-directed differences in the short latency stretch reflex of the non-dominant limb. There were consistent effects of load, preparatory delay duration and target direction on the long latency stretch reflex. However, by comparing stretch reflex responses in the non-dominant arm with those previously documented in the dominant arm, we demonstrate that goal-directed tuning of short and long latency stretch reflexes is markedly weaker in the non-dominant limb. The results indicate that the motor performance asymmetries across the two upper limbs is partly due to the more sophisticated control of reflexive stiffness in the dominant limb, likely facilitated by the superior goal-directed control of muscle spindle receptors. Our findings therefore suggest that independent fusimotor control plays a role in determining performance of complex motor behaviours and support existing proposals that the dominant arm is better supplied for executing more complex tasks, such as trajectory control.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMost of us routinely rely on the dominant arm to perform more complex and demanding motor tasks, but the mechanisms enabling the superior motor performance of the dominant limb are unclear.\nC_LIO_LIA better understanding of the motor asymmetry across the two arms might provide key insight into core sensorimotor principles.\nC_LIO_LIThis study shows that goal-directed tuning of short and long latency stretch reflexes in the non-dominant arm is markedly weaker than in the dominant arm.\nC_LIO_LIOur results suggest that the more sophisticated control of reflexive stiffness in the dominant limb, likely facilitated by superior fusimotor control, partly underpins the laterality of motor performance.\nC_LI",

Importantly, by looking at the local level of synchronization, it is possible to obtain a comprehensive characterization of the spatiotemporal patterns affected at different spatial scales. In the current study, we applied the turbulent dynamics framework to investigate the temporal evolution in whole-brain dynamics using an open access resting state fMRI dataset from a cohort of moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients and healthy controls (HC). We first examined how several measures related to turbulent dynamics differ between HCs and TBI patients at 3-, 6- and 12-months post-injury. We found a significant reduction in these empirical measures after TBI, with the largest change at 6-months post-injury. Next, we built a Hopf whole-brain model with coupled oscillators and conducted in silico perturbations to investigate the mechanistic principles underlying the reduced turbulent dynamics found in the empirical data. This revealed a shift to lower coupling parameters in the TBI dataset and, critically, decreased susceptibility and information encoding capability. These findings confirm the potential of the turbulent framework to characterize whole-brain dynamics after TBI and suggest a mechanistic link between structural disconnection and impaired information processing.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWhole-brain turbulent dynamics capture longitudinal changes after TBI during one-year recovery period\nC_LIO_LITBI patients show partial recovery of resting state network dynamics at large spatial scales\nC_LIO_LIWhole-brain computational modeling provides a mechanistic link between structural disconnection and recovery\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Lymph nodes are uniquely organised to form specialised niches for immune interactions. Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are an essential stromal component of lymph nodes - forming intricate 3-dimensional networks to facilitate communication between immune cells and depositing and ensheathing extracellular matrix on the conduit network. However, beyond these structural roles, FRCs regulate immune function through the production of growth factors, chemokines and inflammatory cues. Here we sought to determine how the immunoregulatory properties of FRCs are determined. Since PDPN has been implicated in lymph node development, we directly tested how the PDPN/CLEC-2 signalling axis impacted the immunoregulatory properties of FRCs in vitro and in vivo. We find that FRCs use the PDPN/CLEC-2 signalling axis to switch transcriptional states and alter the expression of immune related genes. In vivo, genetic deletion of PDPN from fibroblastic stroma in PDGFR mGFP{Delta}PDPN mice downregulated key immunoregulatory molecules CCL21, VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 and attenuated the activation, proliferation and differentiation of lymphocyte populations. Further, PDGFRmGFP{Delta}PDPN mice exhibited severe disruption of the FRC network structure, leading to a failure to separate B and T lymphocytes and misdistribution of myeloid cells through the tissue. We conclude that PDPN expression controls signalling pathways beyond cytoskeletal regulation and cell mechanics and that PDPN expression is required for FRC phenotype and function in lymph nodes.",

    "abstract": "Enterovirus-D68 (EV-D68) often causes mild respiratory infections, but can also cause severe respiratory infections and extra-respiratory complications, including acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). Systemic dissemination of EV-D68 is crucial for the development of extra-respiratory diseases, but it is currently unclear how EV-D68 viremia occurs. We hypothesize that immune cells contribute to the systemic dissemination of EV-D68, as this is a mechanism commonly used by other enteroviruses. Therefore, we investigated the susceptibility and permissiveness of human primary immune cells for different EV-D68 isolates. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) inoculated with EV-D68, only B cells were susceptible but virus replication was limited. However, B cell-rich cultures, such as Epstein-Barr virus-transformed B-lymphoblastoid cell line (BLCL) and primary lentivirus-transduced B cells, were productively infected. In BLCL, neuraminidase treatment to remove 2,6- and 2,3-linked sialic acids resulted in a significant decrease of EV-D68 infected cells, suggesting that sialic acids are the functional receptor on B cells. Subsequently, we showed that dendritic cells (DCs), particularly immature DCs, are susceptible and permissive for EV-D68 infection and that they can spread EV-D68 to autologous BLCL. Altogether, our findings suggest that immune cells, especially B cells and DCs, play an important role in the development the systemic dissemination of EV-D68 during an infection, which is an essential step towards the development of extra-respiratory complications.\n\nAuthor summaryEnterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is an emerging respiratory virus that has caused outbreaks worldwide since 2014. EV-D68 infects primarily respiratory epithelial cells and the infection commonly results in mild respiratory diseases. However, EV-D68 infection is also associated with complications outside the respiratory tract, including a polio-like paralysis. Despite the severity of these extra-respiratory complications, it is unclear how EV-D68 is able to spread outside the respiratory tract and infect other organs, like the central nervous system (CNS). To understand this, we investigated if immune cells play a role in the extra-respiratory spread of EV-D68. We showed that EV-D68 can infect and replicate in specific immune cells, i.e. B cells and dendritic cells (DCs), and that the virus can be transferred from DCs to B cells. Our findings suggest that lymphoid tissues, which harbor many immune cells, can be a secondary replication site for EV-D68, from where virus is released in the circulation. Our data reveal the importance of immune cells in the systemic spread of EV-D68, which is essential for infection of extra-respiratory tissues. Intervention strategies that prevent EV-D68 infection of immune cells will therefore potentially prevent virus spread from the respiratory tract to other organs.",

In a previous study amplicon study, we determined that sequences corresponding to the endosymbiotic genus Rickettsia were significantly more associated with tardigrades than with the substrate from which they were isolated. Here, we performed fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using a Rickettsia-specific probe, RickB1, to determine if Rickettsia could be found in tardigrades. RickB1 and a probe targeting most bacteria, EUB338, colocalized within the tissues of tardigrades, indicating the presence of Rickettsia. We also performed FISH using RickB1 and a nonsense probe which allowed us to distinguish between false positives and true positives. This method revealed RickB1 signals in tardigrades that were not due to erroneous probe binding, providing further evidence that Rickettsia is present in tardigrades.

In the Lyme disease borreliae, these prophages are maintained as circular episomes that are called cp32s (circular plasmid 32kb). The cp32s of Lyme agents are particularly unique in that they encode two distinct families of lipoproteins, Erp and Rev, that are expressed on the bacterias outer surface during infection of vertebrate hosts. All identified functions of those outer surface proteins involve interactions between the spirochetes and host molecules: Erp proteins bind plasmin(ogen), laminin, glycosaminoglycans, and/or components of complement, and Rev proteins bind fibronectin. Thus, cp32 prophages provide their bacterial hosts with surface proteins that can enhance infection processes, thereby facilitating their own survival. Horizontal transfer via bacteriophage particles increases spread of beneficial alleles and creates diversity among Erp and Rev proteins.",

Platelets are small anuclear cells that can release various inflammatory cytokines and biological response modulators when activated. In cardiovascular diseases, platelets are crucial for the inflammatory response but their role in AAA is poorly understood. However, both -experimental and clinical data-strongly suggest that platelet activation may be relevant for AAA formation and progression. Here, we find that platelets play a crucial role in promoting AAA through modulation of inflammation and degradation of the ECM. They are responsible for the up-regulation of SPP1 (osteopontin, OPN) gene expression in macrophages and aortic tissue, which triggers inflammation and remodeling. Further, enhanced platelet activation and pro-coagulant activity results in elevated gene expression of various cytokines, Mmp9 and Col1a1 in macrophages. Platelet depletion in experimental murine AAA reduced inflammation and ECM remodeling, with reduced elastin fragmentation and aortic diameter expansion. In conclusion, our data strongly supports the potential relevance of anti-platelet therapy to reduce AAA progression and rupture in AAA patients.",

    "abstract": "Protein import into mitochondria is an intricate and highly conserved process essential for organellar biogenesis, and maintenance of its structure and function. Defects in the import apparatus impact the assembly of the respiratory chain and ATP synthase complexes required for oxidative phosphorylation, compromising the supply of ATP to the cytosol. The consequences of reduced bioenergetic function are particularly severe for cells with high energetic demands, such as neurons. However, relatively little is known about how defective import contributes to neurodegeneration, or how aggregation prone toxic proteins, characteristic of neurodegenerative disease, impact mitochondrial import efficiency. Here, we used HeLa cells to investigate how expressing Tau, or a disease-causing variant, affects mitochondrial import activity, morphology, and function. We found that a variant associated with frontotemporal dementia (TauP301L), but not the native version, colocalises with mitochondria, associating with TOM40-the protein-channel component of the outer membrane import complex. Interestingly, TauP301L production had no discernible effect on overall mitochondrial import function, despite associating with TOM40 and altering mitochondrial morphology. This raised suspicions of a rescue mechanism manifested by the appearance of microtubule and actin containing tunnelling nanotubes (TNTs), used to recruit healthy mitochondria from neighbouring cells and/ or dispose of mitochondria containing aggregated Tau. Furthermore, in primary neuronal cultures TauP301L induces morphological changes that resemble a neurodegeneration-like phenotype-also mirrored in cells where the import sites are blocked artificially. These results reveal an intriguing link between the production of aggregation prone protein variants, such as TauP301L and others, with the mitochondrial protein import machinery relevant to neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac resident macrophages (crMPs) were recently shown to exert pivotal functions in cardiac homeostasis and disease, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unclear. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized as important regulatory molecules in a number of cell types, but neither the identity nor the molecular mechanisms of lncRNAs in crMPs are known. Here, we have employed deep RNA-seq and single cell RNA sequencing to resolve the crMP lncRNA landscape from healthy and diseased murine myocardium. CrMPs express previously unknown and highly cell type-specific lncRNAs, among which one lncRNA, termed Schlafenlnc, was particularly abundant and enriched in crMPs. We found Schlafenlnc to be necessary for migration-associated gene expression in macrophages in vitro and in vivo and essential for their adhesion and migration. Collectively, our data provide a basis to the systematic characterization of lncRNAs in crMPs and establish Schlafenlnc as a critical regulator of macrophage migratory functions.",

Knowledge about protein localization in Golgi compartments is largely based on work in cell lines. Here, we systematically compared protein localization of 21 endogenous proteins in the Golgi apparatus of mouse neurons using confocal microscopy and line scan analysis. We localized these proteins by measuring the distance relative to the canonical TGN marker TGN38. Based on this, proteins fell into three groups: upstream of, overlapping with or downstream of TGN38. Seven proteins showed complete overlap with TGN38, while proteins downstream of TGN38 were located at varying distances from TGN38. Proteins upstream of TGN38 were localized in between TGN38 and the cis-/medial Golgi markers Giantin and GM130. This localization was consistent with protein function.

    "abstract": "The nucleus is a mechanically stable compartment of the cell that contains the genome and performs many essential functions. Nuclear mechanical components chromatin and lamins maintain nuclear shape, compartmentalization, and function by resisting antagonistic actin contraction and confinement. However, studies have yet to compare chromatin and lamins perturbations side-by-side as well as modulated actin contraction while holding confinement constant. To accomplish this, we used NLS-GFP to measure nuclear shape and rupture in live cells with chromatin decompaction (VPA), loss of lamin B1 (LMNB1-/-), and loss of lamin A/C (LMNA-/-). We then modulated actin contraction while maintaining actin confinement measured by nuclear height. Wild type, chromatin decompaction, and lamin B1 null present bleb-based nuclear deformations and ruptures dependent on actin contraction and independent of actin confinement. Inhibition of actin contraction by Y27632 decreased nuclear blebbing and ruptures to near 0% of cells while activation of actin contraction by CN03 increased the frequency of ruptures by nearly two-fold. However, lamin A/C null results in overall abnormal shape, but similar blebs and ruptures as wild type which were unaffected by actin contraction modulation. Actin contraction control of nuclear shape and ruptures showed that DNA damage levels were more correlated with perturbed nuclear shape than they were with changes in nuclear ruptures. We reveal that lamin B1 is a chromatin decompaction phenotype because using GSK126, which mimics the loss of facultative heterochromatin in lamin B1 null, is sufficient to phenocopy increased nuclear blebbing and ruptures. Furthermore, even though blebs and ruptures in lamin A/C null cells are insensitive to actin contraction, they do have the capacity to form increased levels of nuclear blebs and bleb-based ruptures, shown by treating with VPA. Thus, nuclear bleb formation and bleb-based nuclear ruptures are driven by actin contraction and independent of changes in actin confinement.",

Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this disease is a prerequisite to identify potential pharmacological treatment strategies. In this study, we present a unique aortic valve cell isolation technique to acquire specific human and porcine cell populations and compared VICs and VECs of these species with each other for the first time.\n\nMethods and ResultsAortic valve cells were isolated from human explants from patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement or porcine valvular tissue. Pure VEC and VIC populations could be verified by gene expression analysis and immunofluorescence staining showing a highly significant upregulation of endothelial markers in VECs and mesenchymal markers in VICs, respectively. Further analysis and comparison of cells in in vitro experiments revealed that endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition could be induced in hVECs, leading to significant increase of mesenchymal markers. In vitro calcification experiments of VICs induced by osteogenic medium or pro-calcifying medium demonstrated a pronounced calcification marker expression and visible calcific deposition in Alizarin red staining in both species.\n\nConclusionThis study aims to initiate a first step towards standardization of a reproducible isolation technique for pure human and porcine VEC and VIC populations. Comparison of human and porcine aortic valve cells demonstrated that porcine cells might serve as an alternative cellular model system, in settings, where human tissues are difficult to obtain.\n\nStatements and DeclarationsThe authors declare no relevant financial or non-financial interests to disclose.",

    "abstract": "Accurate timing of division and size homeostasis is crucial for cells. A potential mechanism for cells to decide the timing of division is the differential scaling of regulatory protein copy numbers with cell size. However, it remains unclear whether such a mechanism can lead to robust growth and division, and how the scaling behaviors of regulatory proteins influence the cell size distribution. Here we study a mathematical model combining gene expression and cell growth, in which the cell-cycle activators scale superlinearly with cell size while the inhibitors scale sublinearly. The cell divides once the ratio of their concentrations reaches a threshold value. We find that the cell can robustly grow and divide within a finite range of the threshold value with the cell size proportional to the ploidy. In a stochastic version of the model, the cell size at division is uncorrelated with that at birth. Also, the more differential the cell-size scaling of the cell-cycle regulators is, the narrower the cell-size distribution is. Intriguingly, our model with multiple regulators rationalizes the observation that after the deletion of a single regulator, the coefficient of variation of cell size remains roughly the same though the average cell size changes significantly. Our work reveals that the differential scaling of cell-cycle regulators provides a robust mechanism of cell size control.\n\nAuthor summaryHow cells determine the timing of cell division is a fundamental question of cell biology. It has been found that the concentration of cell-cycle activators tends to increase with cell size, while the concentration of inhibitors tends to decrease. Therefore, an attractive hypothesis is that the ratio of activators to inhibitors may trigger cell division. To investigate this hypothesis quantitatively, we study a model including gene expression and cell growth simultaneously. The cell divides once the activator-to-inhibitor ratio reaches a threshold. Combining theories and simulations, we analyze the conditions of robust cell cycle and the cell size distribution. Our model successfully rationalizes several experimental observations, including the relation between cell size and ploidy, the sizer behavior of cell size control, and the change of the mean and breadth of cell size distribution after regulator deletion.",

We showed that the EMC directly contributes to sorting fidelity of mitochondrial TAs and multipass substrates that contain positively charged soluble domains. Leveraging an improved structural model of the human EMC, we used mutagenesis and site-specific crosslinking to map the path of a TA from its cytosolic capture by methionine-rich loops to its membrane insertion through a hydrophilic vestibule. Positively charged residues at the entrance to the vestibule function as a selectivity filter that uses charge-repulsion to reject mitochondrial TAs.

    "abstract": "Despite an abundance of gene expression surveys, comparatively little is known about Hox gene function in Chelicerata, with emphasis on the Hox logic of the anterior prosomal segments, which bear the mouthparts. Previous investigations of individual paralogs of labial (lab) and Deformed (Dfd) in the spider Parasteatoda tepidariorum have shown that these play a role in tissue maintenance of the pedipalpal segment (labial-1) and in patterning the first walking leg identity (Deformed-1), respectively. However, broader extrapolations of these data points across chelicerates are hindered by the existence of duplicated copies of Hox genes in arachnopulmonates (e.g., spiders and scorpions), which have resulted from an ancient whole genome duplication event. Here, we investigated the function of single-copy orthologs of lab in the harvestman Phalangium opilio, an exemplar of a lineage that was not subject of this whole genome duplication. Embryonic RNAi against lab resulted in homeotic transformations of pedipalps to chelicerae, as well as reduction and fusion of the pedipalpal segment with adjacent segments. To test for combinatorial function, we performed double knockdown of lab and Dfd, which results in homeotic transformation of both pedipalps and first walking legs into cheliceral identity, whereas the second walking leg is transformed into a pedipalpal identity. Taken together, these results elucidate a model for the Hox logic of head segments in Chelicerata. To substantiate the validity of this model, we additionally performed expression surveys for duplicated copies of lab and Dfd in scorpions and horseshoe crabs, toward understanding the genetic basis of a heteronomous prosoma. We show that repetition of morphologically similar appendages is correlated with uniform expression levels of the Hox genes lab and Dfd, irrespective of the number of gene copies.",

Shewanella algae is intrinsic resistant to various classes of {beta}-lactams. Additionally, growing resistance to colistin in mcr-negative Shewanella algae further limits therapeutic options, especially in resource-limited regions. Currently, little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying colistin resistance in Shewanella algae, partly due to complex epistatic interactions among multiple genes.

    "abstract": "Changes in DNA methylation with age are observed across the tree of life. The stereotypical nature of these changes can be modeled to produce epigenetic clocks capable of predicting biological age with unprecedented accuracy. Despite the predictive ability of epigenetic clocks, the underlying processes that produce clock signals are not resolved but are hypothesized to be rooted in stochastic processes leading to an erosion in the epigenetic landscape. Here, we test this hypothesis using a novel computational approach for measuring disorder in DNA methylation patterns across the epigenome. We find that loci comprising conventional epigenetic clocks are enriched in regions that both accumulate and lose disorder with age, suggesting a direct link between DNA methylation disorder and epigenetic clock signals. Across the murine lifespan, disorder accumulates in Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 target genes and decreases in CTCF and transcription factor binding sites, resulting in genomic hotspots of age-related epigenetic disorder. We further investigate the connections between age-related changes in disorder and epigenetic clock signals by comparing the influences of development, lifespan interventions, and cellular dedifferentiation using a series of newly developed epigenetic clocks based on regional disorder, average methylation states, and commonly used measures of entropy. We identify both common responses as well as critical differences between canonical epigenetic clocks and those based on regional disorder, demonstrating a fundamental decoupling of epigenetic aging processes. Collectively, this work identifies key linkages between epigenetic disorder and epigenetic clock signals, and simultaneously demonstrates the multifaceted nature of epigenetic aging in which stochastic processes occurring at non-random loci produce predictable outcomes.",

Unusually, instead of laying eggs, tsetse birth a single larva that immediately burrows into the soil to pupate. Where the female chooses to larviposit is therefore crucial for offspring survival. Previous studies showed that a putative larval pheromone, n-pentadecane, attracts gravid female Glossina morsitans morsitans to appropriate larviposition sites. However, this attraction could not be reproduced in field experiments. Here, we resolve this disparity by designing naturalistic laboratory experiments that closely mimic the characteristics found in the wild. We show that gravid tsetse were neither attracted to the putative pheromone nor, interestingly, to pupae placed in the soil. In contrast, females appear to choose larviposition sites based on environmental cues. We conclude that it is the substrate, rather than larval pheromones, which drives larviposition site selection under naturalistic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions needing new and better treatments. Research and development of anxiolytic drugs using animal models heavily rely on behavioural tests, most of which measure anxiolytic effects by increased exploratory activity in potentially threatening environments. However, interpretation of such tests is ambiguous because reduced exploratory activity can reflect either anxiety or sedation by the compound. Based on a systematic review of the sensitivity of mouse behavioural tests of anxiety to anxiolytic drugs, we analysed outcomes of 206 studies testing the effect of diazepam in either the open-field test or the hole-board test, as outcomes of these tests showed substantial variation in both direction and strength of the drug effect. Surprisingly, we found that both the rationale given for using the test, whether to detect anxiolytic or sedative effects, and the predicted effect of diazepam, anxiolytic or sedative, strongly depended on the reported test results. The most likely explanation for such strong dependency is post-hoc reasoning, also called hypothesizing after the results are known (HARKing). HARKing can invalidate study outcomes and hampers evidence synthesis by inflating effect sizes. It may also lead researchers into blind alleys, put patients in clinical trials at risk, and waste animals, time, and resources for inconclusive research.",

    "abstract": "Regulated cellular aggregation is an essential process for development and healing in many animal tissues. In some animals and a few distantly related unicellular species, cellular aggregation is regulated by diffusible chemical cues. However, it is unclear whether regulated cellular aggregation was part of the life cycles of the first multicellular animals and/or their unicellular ancestors. To fill this gap, we investigated the triggers of cellular aggregation in one of animals closest unicellular living relatives - the filasterean Capsaspora owczarzaki. We discovered that Capsaspora aggregation is induced by chemical cues, as observed in some of the earliest branching animals and other unicellular species. Specifically, we found that calcium ions and lipids present in lipoproteins function together to induce aggregation of viable Capsaspora cells. We also found that this multicellular stage is reversible, as depletion of the cues triggers disaggregation, which can be overcome upon re-induction. Our finding demonstrates that chemically regulated aggregation is important across diverse members of the holozoan clade. Therefore, this phenotype was plausibly integral to the life cycles of the unicellular ancestors of animals.",

    "abstract": "For volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to be released from the plant cell into the atmosphere, they have to cross the plasma membrane, the cell wall, and the cuticle. However, how these hydrophobic compounds cross the hydrophilic cell wall is largely unknown. Using biochemical and reverse-genetic approaches combined with mathematical modeling, we show that cell-wall localized non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) facilitate VOC emission. Out of three highly expressed nsLTPs in petunia petals, which emit high levels of phenylpropanoid/benzenoid compounds, only PhnsLTP3 contributes to the VOC export across the cell wall to the cuticle. A decrease in PhnsLTP3 expression reduces volatile emission and leads to VOC redistribution with less VOCs reaching the cuticle without affecting their total pools. This intracellular build-up of VOCs lowers their biosynthesis by feedback downregulation of phenylalanine precursor supply to prevent self-intoxication. Overall, these results demonstrate that nsLTPs are intrinsic members of the VOC emission network, which facilitate VOC diffusion across the cell wall.",

    "abstract": "For at least two centuries, scientists have been enthralled by the \"zombie\" behaviors induced by mind-controlling parasites. Despite this interest, the mechanistic bases of these uncanny processes have remained mostly a mystery. Here, we leverage the recently established Entomophthora muscae-Drosophila melanogaster \"zombie fly\" system to reveal the molecular and cellular underpinnings of summit disease, a manipulated behavior evoked by many fungal parasites. Using a new, high-throughput behavior assay to measure summiting, we discovered that summiting behavior is characterized by a burst of locomotion and requires the host circadian and neurosecretory systems, specifically DN1p circadian neurons, pars intercerebralis to corpora allata projecting (PI-CA) neurons and corpora allata (CA), who are solely responsible for juvenile hormone (JH) synthesis and release. Summiting is a fleeting phenomenon, posing a challenge for physiological and biochemical experiments requiring tissue from summiting flies. We addressed this with a machine learning classifier to identify summiting animals in real time. PI-CA neurons and CA appear to be intact in summiting animals, despite E. muscae cells invading the host brain, particularly in the superior medial protocerebrum (SMP), the neuropil that contains DN1p axons and PI-CA dendrites. The blood-brain barrier of flies late in their infection was significantly permeabilized, suggesting that factors in the hemolymph may have greater access to the central nervous system during summiting. Metabolomic analysis of hemolymph from summiting flies revealed differential abundance of several compounds compared to non-summiting flies. Transfusing the hemolymph of summiting flies into non-summiting recipients induced a burst of locomotion, demonstrating that factor(s) in the hemolymph likely cause summiting behavior. Altogether, our work reveals a neuro-mechanistic model for summiting wherein fungal cells perturb the flys hemolymph, activating the neurohormonal pathway linking clock neurons to juvenile hormone production in the CA, ultimately inducing locomotor activity in their host.",

These pathways include a ventral pathway for object recognition, a dorsal pathway for performing visually guided physical actions and a recently proposed third pathway for social perception. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that different categories of moving stimuli are differentially processed across the dorsal and third pathways according to their behavioural implications. Human participants (N=30) were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing moving and static stimuli from five categories (faces, bodies, scenes, objects, and scrambled objects). Whole brain group analyses showed that moving bodies and moving objects increased neural responses in bilateral V5/MT+ and intraparietal sulcus (IPS), parts of the dorsal pathway. In addition, moving faces and moving bodies increased neural responses in bilateral V5/MT+ and the right posterior superior temporal sulcus (rpSTS), parts of the third pathway. This pattern of results was also supported by a separate region of interest (ROI) analysis showing that moving stimuli produced more robust neural responses for all visual object categories, particularly in lateral and dorsal brain areas. Our results suggest that dynamic naturalistic stimuli from different categories are routed along specific visual pathways that process their unique behavioural implications.",

However, evidence of errors in lipid homeostasis as a pathogenic mechanism of neurodegeneration remains limited. Here, we show that the cerebellar neurodegeneration caused by SNX14 deficiency is associated with lipid metabolism defects. Recent in vitro and in silico studies indicate that SNX14 is an inter-organelle lipid transfer protein that regulates lipid droplet biogenesis and fatty acid desaturation, suggesting that human SNX14 deficiency belongs to an expanding class of cerebellar neurodegenerative disorders caused by altered cellular lipid homeostasis. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mouse model that recapitulates the human SNX14 deficiency at genetic and phenotypic level. Through histological and transcriptomic analyses, we demonstrate that cerebellar Purkinje cells are selectively vulnerable to SNX14 deficiency, while forebrain regions preserve their neuronal content. Ultrastructure and lipidomic studies reveal widespread lipid storage and metabolism defects in SNX14 deficient mice. Furthermore, we identify a unique lipid metabolite profile that links the accumulation of acylcarnitines with the selective cerebellar neurodegeneration in SNX14 deficiency. These findings highlight the importance of lipid homeostasis for neuronal function and survival and suggest a mechanism for selective cerebellar vulnerability to altered lipid homeostasis.",

The detection and quantification of TRPM8 seems crucial for advancing in the knowledge of the mechanisms under-lying its role in these pathophysiological conditions. Antibody-based techniques are commonly used for protein detection and quantification, although their performance with many ion channels, including TRPM8, is suboptimal. Thus, the search for reliable antibodies is of utmost importance. In this study, we characterized the performance of six TRPM8 commercial antibodies in three immunodetection techniques: western blot, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry.

Computational models of the interplay of excitation and suppression in single neurons aim at investigating how this interaction affects a neurons spiking responses and shapes, for example, the encoding of sensory stimuli. Here, we compare the performance of three filter-based stimulus-encoding models in predicting retinal ganglion cell responses recorded from axolotl, mouse, and marmoset retina to different types of temporally varying visual stimuli. Suppression in these models is implemented via subtractive or divisive interactions of stimulus filters or by a response-driven feedback module. For the majority of ganglion cells, the subtractive and divisive models perform similarly and outperform the feedback model as well as a linear-nonlinear (LN) model with no suppression. Comparison between the subtractive and the divisive model depended on cell type, species, and stimulus components, with the divisive model generalizing best across temporal stimulus frequencies and visual contrast and the subtractive model capturing in particular responses for slow temporal stimulus dynamics and for slow axolotl cells. Overall, we conclude that the divisive and subtractive models are well suited for capturing interactions of excitation and suppression in ganglion cells and emphasize different temporal regimes of these interactions.",

During fMRI, participants performed a parametric conflict task that separately tags target and distractor processing. Consistent with feature-specific monitoring, univariate analyses revealed spatially segregated encoding of target and distractor difficulty in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. Consistent with feature-specific attentional priority, a novel multivariate analysis (Encoding Geometry Analysis) revealed overlapping, but orthogonal, representations of target and distractor coherence in intraparietal sulcus. Coherence representations were mediated by control demands and aligned with both performance and frontoparietal activity, consistent with top-down attention.

    "abstract": "World-wide, nearly 40% of the adult population is classified as clinically obese. Central inflammation is highly correlated with obesity and increases morbidity and deterioration of health. The hypothalamus is a brain region that governs many facets of energy homeostasis, and melanocortins in the hypothalamus both decrease feeding and increase metabolism via melanocortin-4 receptors (MC4Rs). Although MC4Rs are present on neurons and astrocytes (aMC4R) previous work has focused almost exclusively on the neuronal population with the contribution of aMC4R on these processes largely unknown. Our objective was to determine the effects of hypothalamic aMC4R deletion on central and peripheral inflammation, as well as feeding and body weight homeostasis. Adult MC4R fl/fl mice were microinjected with an astrocyte-specific promoter driving Cre-expression (AAV-GFAP-GFP-Cre) or AAV-control (AAV-GFAP-GFP; n=4-7/group/sex) to produce a hypothalamic knock-down of aMC4R (KD). Body weight and composition were monitored throughout the study, and indirect calorimetry was conducted at 1 and 4 weeks after AAV injection. Acquisition of operant self-administration of palatable food was also examined. Mice were euthanized 7-8 weeks post AAV injection and brain and tissue samples were collected. We observed a significant increase in body weight, feeding, and energy balance in the KD group compared to control group. Inflammation was significantly increased centrally in KD mice within the hypothalamus, but not peripherally within serum. Additionally, aMC4R KD mice trended towards an increased reward learning for palatable food. This is the first demonstration that hypothalamic aMC4R, independent of neuronal MC4R, is important in modulating inflammation as well as contributing to energy balance. These results provide an integral understanding of the aMC4R system that will provide the foundation for future studies investigating the role of aMC4R in various disease states.",

    "abstract": "Monocular deprivation (MD) causes an initial decrease in synaptic responses to the deprived eye in juvenile mouse primary visual cortex (V1) through Hebbian long-term depression (LTD). This is followed by a homeostatic increase, which has been attributed to synaptic scaling. However, homeostasis during other forms of visual deprivation is caused by sliding the threshold for Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP) rather than scaling. We therefore asked whether the homeostatic increase during MD requires GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor activity, which is required to slide the plasticity threshold but not for synaptic scaling. Selective GluN2B blockade from 2-6d after monocular lid suture prevented the homeostatic increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) amplitude in monocular V1 of acute slices and prevented the increase in visually evoked responses in binocular V1 in vivo. The decrease in mEPSC amplitude and visually evoked responses during the first 2d of MD also required GluN2B activity. Together, these results indicate that GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors first play a role in LTD immediately following eye closure, and then promote homeostasis during prolonged MD by sliding the plasticity threshold in favor of LTP.",

    "abstract": "Prion-like transmission of pathology in -synucleinopathies like Parkinsons disease or multiple system atrophy is increasingly recognized as one potential mechanism to address disease progression. Active and passive immunotherapies targeting insoluble, aggregated -synuclein are already being actively explored in the clinic with mixed outcomes so far. Here, we report the identification of 306C7B3, a highly selective, aggregate-specific -synuclein antibody with picomolar affinity devoid of binding to the monomeric, physiologic protein. 306C7B3 binding is Ser129-phosphorylation independent and shows high affinity to several different aggregated -synuclein polymorphs, increasing the likelihood that it can also bind to the pathological seeds assumed to drive disease progression in patients. In support of this, highly selective binding to pathological aggregates in postmortem brains of MSA patients was demonstrated, with no staining in samples from other human neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nTo achieve CNS exposure of 306C7B3, an Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) based approach driving expression of the secreted antibody within the brain of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-h-Synuclein mice was used. Widespread central transduction after intrastriatal inoculation was ensured by using the AAV2HBKO serotype, with transduction being spread to areas far away from the inoculation site. Treatment of (Thy-1)-[A30P]-h-Synuclein mice at the age of 12 months demonstrated significantly increased survival, with 306C7B3 concentration reaching 3.9 nM in the cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThese results suggest that AAV-mediated expression of 306C7B3 has great potential as a disease-modifying therapy for -synucleinopathies as it ensures CNS exposure of the antibody, thereby mitigating the selective permeability of the blood-brain barrier.",

    "abstract": "Abnormalities in temporal and frontal lobes (TL and FL) have been linked to cognition and neuropsychiatric disorders. While structural and functional differences between the brain lobes have been documented in disease, the cellular heterogeneity in FL and TL and its impact to the vulnerability to genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders is not well studied. We hypothesize that intrinsic cellular-level differences between TL and FL explain the vulnerability of specific cell types to genetic risk factors and psychoactive drugs. To test this, we integrated single-nucleus transcriptome analysis in fresh human FL and TL with data related to genetic susceptibility and gene dysregulation in neuropsychiatric disease, and response to psychoactive drugs. We also investigate how these differences are associated with gene dysregulation in disease brain. Neuronal cell populations were the most vulnerable to psychiatric genetic risk factors, and more specifically parvalbumin interneurons (PVALB neurons). These PVALB-expressed genetic risk factors were mostly upregulated in the TL compared with FL, and dysregulated in the brain of patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. We found GRIN2A and HCN1, implicated in schizophrenia by genome-wide association studies, to be significantly upregulated in PVLAB from the TL and in brain cortex from schizophrenia patients. Our analysis provides comprehensive evidence for PVALB neurons as the most vulnerable cell type that is implicated in several psychiatric disorders. PVALB neurons showed the highest vulnerability to psychoactive drug response, which was 3.6-fold higher than the vulnerability to genetic risk factors. In summary, we show high vulnerability of PVALB neurons that is specific to the temporal lobe, implying that differences between TL and FL greatly influence the cell vulnerability to genetic risk factors as well as the response to psychoactive drugs. These findings offer insights into how regional brain differences affect the cell type vulnerabilities in neuropsychiatric disorders.",

Considering our extensive visual and motor experience with body postures, we hypothesized that priors derived from this experience may systematically bias visual body posture representations. We examined two priors: gravity and biomechanical constraints. Gravity pushes lifted body parts downwards, while biomechanical constraints limit the range of possible postures (e.g., an arm raised far behind the head cannot go down further). Across three experiments (N = 246) we probed participants memory of briefly presented postures using change discrimination and adjustment tasks. Results showed that lifted arms were misremembered as lower and as more similar to biomechanically plausible postures. Inverting the body stimuli eliminated both biases, implicating holistic body processing. Together, these findings show that knowledge shapes body posture representations, reflecting modulation from a combination of category-general and category-specific priors.",

    "abstract": "Some conscious experiences are more vivid than others. Although perceptual vividness is a key component of human consciousness, how variation in this magnitude property is registered by the human brain is unknown. A striking feature of magnitudes in other psychological domains, such as number or reward, is the existence of neural magnitude codes that are independent from sensory contents. To test whether perceptual vividness similarly covaries with neural codes that are invariant to sensory content, we reanalysed existing MEG and fMRI data from two distinct studies, quantifying perceptual vividness via subjective ratings of awareness and visibility. Using representational similarity and decoding analyses, we find evidence for the existence of content-invariant neural codes for perceptual vividness distributed across visual, parietal, and frontal cortices. Our findings are consistent with a hypothesis that the subjective vividness of conscious experience is supported by neural signatures similar to magnitude codes in other cognitive domains.\n\nSignificance StatementThe vividness of conscious experience varies across different stimuli and contexts. Despite being a fundamental feature of conscious awareness, exactly how perceptual vividness is encoded in the human brain remains unclear. Neural codes underpinning magnitude in reward and numerosity domains have been shown to be unchanging as stimulus identity varies. Here, we test whether components of neural activity covarying with the magnitude of perceptual vividness are similarly independent of perceptual content in analyses of MEG and fMRI data. We find dynamic, content-invariant neural signatures of vividness in visual, parietal, and frontal cortices. Our findings introduce the surprising notion that neural signatures of conscious experience might follow similar coding principles to those found for magnitude properties of entirely different cognitive domains.",

    "abstract": "To understand how sensory events are represented in and perceived by the brain, one must understand how varying internal brain states affect neuronal decoding of sensory input. Recent studies indicate global state changes in the brain impact the representation of haptic events in neurons of the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). It could be argued that the manipulations used so far to alter the cortical circuitry behavior were artificial and not reflective of normal information processing in the neocortex. In the present study we therefore wanted to explore if natural visual stimulation also could impact the interpretation of given tactile input patterns. We recorded the unitary extracellular responses to a set of spatiotemporal tactile input patterns presented either alone or together with simultaneously multicolor flashing lights from a large number of neurons in parallel in the rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1). We found that the visual input, mildly but consistently altered the temporal spike outputs to tactile input patterns in S1 neurons. We argue that the visual input change the global cortical state to an extent that it affects the cortical representation of haptic events even within the S1 and that this is an indication that the cortical network in its information processing may be far more reliant on globally distributed network dynamics than traditionally thought.",

Additionally, we utilize global proteomic analysis of the nucleus accumbens following microbiome manipulation and fentanyl administration to define how microbiome status alters the functional proteomic landscape in this key limbic substructure.

    "abstract": "The motility of macrophages in response to microenvironment stimuli is a hallmark of innate immunity, where macrophages play pro-inflammatory or pro-reparatory roles depending on their activation status during wound healing. Cell size and shape have been informative in defining macrophage subtypes, but their link to motility properties is unknown, despite M1 and M2 macrophages exhibiting distinct migratory behaviors, in vitro, in 3D and in vivo. We apply both morphology and motility-based image processing approaches to analyze live cell images consisting of macrophage phenotypes. Macrophage subtypes are differentiated from primary murine bone marrow derived macrophages using a potent lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or cytokine interleukin-4 (IL-4). We show that morphology is tightly linked to motility, which leads to our hypothesis that motility analysis could be used alone or in conjunction with morphological features for improved prediction of macrophage subtypes. We train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to predict macrophage subtypes based on morphology alone, motility alone, and both morphology and motility combined. We show that motility has comparable predictive capabilities as morphology. However, using both measures can enhance predictive capabilities. While motility and morphological features can be individually ambiguous identifiers, together they provide significantly improved prediction accuracies (>79%) using only phase contrast time-lapse microscopy and a small unique cell count for training ([~]250). Thus, the approach combining cell motility and cell morphology information can accurately assess functionally diverse macrophage phenotypes quickly and efficiently. Our approach offers a cost efficient and high through-put method for screening biochemicals targeting macrophage polarization with small datasets.\n\nSignificancePrevious work has shown that macrophage phenotypes can be distinguished by their morphological characteristics. We extend this work to show that distinct motility patterns are linked to macrophage morphology. Thus, motility patterns can be used to differentiate phenotypes. This can enable high-throughput classification of cell phenotypes without regard for the high-resolution images needed to back out morphological characteristics. Furthermore, combining motility-based features with morphological information improves prediction of macrophage subtypes by a machine learning based classification model.",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of highly repetitive sequences within the human Y chromosome has led to its incomplete assembly and systematic omission from genomic analyses. Here, we present long-read de novo assemblies of 43 diverse Y chromosomes spanning 180,000 years of human evolution, including two from deep-rooted African Y lineages, and report remarkable complexity and diversity in chromosome size and structure, in contrast with its low level of base substitution variation. The size of the Y chromosome assemblies varies extensively from 45.2 to 84.9 Mbp and include, on average, 81 kbp of novel sequence per Y chromosome. Half of the male-specific euchromatic region is subject to large inversions with a >2-fold higher recurrence rate compared to inversions in the rest of the human genome. Ampliconic sequences associated with these inversions further show differing mutation rates that are sequence context-dependent and some ampliconic genes show evidence for concerted evolution with the acquisition and purging of lineage-specific pseudogenes. The largest heterochromatic region in the human genome, the Yq12, is composed of alternating arrays of DYZ1 and DYZ2 repeat units that show extensive variation in the number, size and distribution of these arrays, but retain a 1:1 copy number ratio of the monomer repeats, consistent with the notion that functional or evolutionary forces are acting on this chromosomal region. Finally, our data suggests that the boundary between the recombining pseudoautosomal region 1 and the non-recombining portions of the X and Y chromosomes lies 500 kbp distal to the currently established boundary. The availability of sequence-resolved Y chromosomes from multiple individuals provides a unique opportunity for identifying new associations of specific traits with Y-chromosomal variants and garnering novel insights into the evolution and function of complex regions of the human genome.",

Here, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium presents the complete 62,460,029 base pair sequence of a human Y chromosome from the HG002 genome (T2T-Y) that corrects multiple errors in GRCh38-Y and adds over 30 million base pairs of sequence to the reference, revealing the complete ampliconic structures of TSPY, DAZ, and RBMY gene families; 41 additional protein-coding genes, mostly from the TSPY family; and an alternating pattern of human satellite 1 and 3 blocks in the heterochromatic Yq12 region.

    "abstract": "Inherited retinal diseases are a leading and untreatable cause of blindness and are therefore candidate diseases for gene therapy. Recombinant vectors derived from adeno-associated virus (rAAV) are currently the most promising vehicles for in vivo therapeutic gene delivery to the retina. However, there is a need for novel AAV-based vectors with greater efficacy for ophthalmic applications, as underscored by recent reports of dose-related inflammatory responses in clinical trials of rAAV-based ocular gene therapies. Improved therapeutic efficacy of vectors would allow for decreases in the dose delivered, with consequent reductions in immune reactions. Here, we describe the development of new rAAV vectors using bioconjugation chemistry to modify the rAAV capsid, thereby improving the therapeutic index. Covalent coupling of a mannose ligand, via the formation of a thiourea bond, to the amino groups of the rAAV capsid significantly increases vector transduction efficiency of both rat and nonhuman primate retinas. These optimized rAAV vectors have important implications for the treatment of a wide range of retinal diseases.",

In C. elegans, the presynaptic boutons of GABAergic DD neurons are moved to new locations during early larval development. We show that developmentally regulated expression of a presynaptic Epithelial Na+ Channel (ENaC), UNC-8, promotes a Ca2+-dependent mechanism, resembling Activity-Dependent Bulk Endocytosis (ADBE), that dismantles presynaptic material for reassembly at nascent DD synapses. ADBE normally functions in highly active neurons to accelerate local recycling of synaptic vesicles. We show that DD presynaptic remodeling depends on canonical features of ADBE including elevated intracellular Ca2+, the phosphatase Calcineurin and its targets, dynamin and the F-BAR protein syndapin, and Arp2/3-driven actin polymerization. Thus, our findings suggest that a native mechanism (ADBE) for maintaining neurotransmitter release at local synapses has been repurposed, in this case, to dismantle presynaptic terminals for reassembly at new locations.\n\nHighlightsO_LIDeveloping GABAergic neurons dismantle presynaptic terminals for reassembly at new locations.\nC_LIO_LIThe DEG/ENaC protein, UNC-8, promotes presynaptic disassembly and recycling\nC_LIO_LICa2+-dependent endocytosis drives presynaptic disassembly and recycling to new boutons\nC_LI",

This organized activity has been shown to be modulated by changes in arousal. Here, we use wide-field voltage imaging to establish the relationship between cortical network activity and arousal in spontaneously behaving head-fixed mice expressing the voltage sensitive fluorescent FRET sensor Butterfly 1.2. This approach allowed us to simultaneously image hemodynamic and voltage activity, and then compare fMRI analogous activity changes to the direct cortical voltage activity in relation to arousal and movement. Arousal and facial movements were assessed through analysis of face video recordings. We find that changes in pupil diameter were differentially coupled to hemodynamics and cortical voltage activity in a regionally and frequency specific way. Further this coupling changed between periods of spontaneous facial movements, and periods of rest. Our results indicate that while fMRI-like hemodynamic signals show strong relations to behavior and arousal, these relations are distinct from those shown by brain voltage activity.",

    "abstract": "The gastrointestinal hormones ghrelin and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) have opposite secretion patterns, as well as opposite effects on metabolism and food intake. Beyond their role in energy homeostasis, gastrointestinal hormones have also been suggested to modulate the reward system. However, the potential of ghrelin and GLP-1 to modulate reward responses in humans has not been systematically reviewed before. To evaluate the convergence of published results, we first conduct a multi-level kernel density meta-analysis of studies reporting a positive association of ghrelin (Ncomb= 353, 18 contrasts) and a negative association of GLP-1 (Ncomb = 258, 12 contrasts) and reward responses measured using task functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Second, we complement the meta-analysis using a systematic literature review, focusing on distinct reward phases and applications in clinical populations that may account for variability across studies. In line with preclinical research, we find that ghrelin increases reward responses across studies in key nodes of the motivational circuit, such as the nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, and the dorsal mid insula. In contrast, for GLP-1, we did not find sufficient convergence in support of reduced reward responses. Instead, our systematic review identifies potential differences of GLP-1 on anticipatory versus consummatory reward responses. Based on a systematic synthesis of available findings, we conclude that there is considerable support for the neuromodulatory potential of gut-based circulating peptides on reward responses. To unlock their potential for clinical applications, future studies may move beyond anticipated rewards to cover other reward facets.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=109 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518539v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c0b00org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19630e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16498c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@169469e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Turning to unsupervised learning, we develop biologically more plausible variants of the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and benchmark their performance on MNIST. We show that RBMs with asymmetric connectivity can still be successfully trained with contrastive divergence, even if no two units are reciprocally connected. Furthermore, RBMs are able to learn if the forward, visible-to-hidden layer weights are kept constant and only the backward, hidden-to-visible layer weights are updated. These findings indicate that neural networks with biologically plausible connectivity support contrastive learning.",

    "abstract": "Tuning of genome structure and function is accomplished by chromatin binding proteins, which determine the transcriptome and phenotype of the cell. We sought to investigate how communication between extracellular stress and chromatin structure may regulate cellular mechanical behaviors. We demonstrate that the linker histone H1.0, which compacts nucleosomes into higher order chromatin fibers, controls genome organization and cellular stress response. Histone H1.0 has privileged expression in fibroblasts across tissue types in mice and humans, and modulation of its expression is necessary and sufficient to mount a myofibroblast phenotype in these cells. Depletion of histone H1.0 prevents transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta})-induced fibroblast contraction, proliferation and migration in a histone H1 isoform-specific manner via inhibition of a transcriptome comprised of extracellular matrix, cytoskeletal and contractile genes. Histone H1.0 is associated with local regulation of gene expression via mechanisms involving chromatin fiber compaction and reprogramming of histone acetylation, rendering the cell stiffer in response to cytokine stimulation. Knockdown of histone H1.0 prevented locus-specific histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation by TGF-{beta} and decreased levels of both HDAC1 and the chromatin reader BRD4, thereby preventing transcription of a fibrotic gene program. Transient depletion of histone H1.0 in vivo decompacts chromatin and prevents fibrosis in cardiac muscle, thereby linking chromatin structure with fibroblast phenotype in response to extracellular stress. Our work identifies an unexpected role of linker histones to orchestrate cellular mechanical behaviors, directly coupling cellular force generation, nuclear organization and gene transcription.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518399v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (103K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a38e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8c4ab4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7c822aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45d02b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Meiosis is associated with genetic changes in the genome - via recombination, gene conversion, and mutations. The occurrence of gene conversion and mutations during meiosis may further be influenced by the chromatin conformation, in analogy to what is known for mutations during mitosis. To date, however, the exact distribution and type of meiosis-associated changes and the role of the chromatin conformation in this context is largely unexplored. Here, we determine recombination, gene conversion, and de novo mutations using whole-genome sequencing of all meiotic products of 23 individual meioses in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important pathogen of wheat. We could confirm a high genome-wide recombination rate of 65 cM/Mb and see higher recombination rates on the accessory compared to core chromosomes. A substantial fraction of 0.16% of all polymorphic markers was affected by gene conversions, showing a weak GC-bias, and occurring at higher frequency in regions of constitutive heterochromatin, indicated by the histone modification H3K9me3. The de novo mutation rate associated with meiosis was approx. three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding mitotic mutation rate. Importantly, repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a fungal defense mechanism against duplicated sequences, is active in Z. tritici and responsible for the majority of these de novo meiotic mutations. Our results indicate that the genetic changes associated with meiosis are a major source of variability in the genome of an important plant pathogen and shape its evolutionary trajectory.\n\nImportanceThe impact of meiosis on the genome composition via gene conversion and mutations is mostly poorly understood, in particular for non-model species. Here, we sequenced all four meiotic products for 23 individual meioses and determined the genetic changes caused by meiosis for the important fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We found a high rate of gene conversions and an effect of the chromatin conformation on gene conversion rates. Higher conversion rates were found in regions enriched with the H3K9me3 - a mark for constitutive heterochromatin. Most importantly, meiosis was associated with a much higher frequency of de novo mutations than mitosis. 78% of the meiotic mutations were caused by repeat-induced point mutations - a fungal defense mechanism against duplicated sequences. In conclusion, the genetic changes associated with meiosis are therefore a major factor shaping the genome of this fungal pathogen.",

The SPT involves numerous complex behaviors, including learning, motivation, and choice. Yet, it remains uncertain whether its main outcome measure, sucrose preference, can reflect these behavioral subcomponents. Here, we conducted an experimental and computational decomposition of mouse behavior in the SPT and discovered previously unrecognized behavioral subcomponents associated with changes in sucrose preference. While both acute and chronic stress reduced sucrose preference, only chronic stress evoked anhedonia. Additionally, reduced sucrose preference induced by optogenetics is not always indicative of anhedonia but can also reflect learning deficits. Even small variations in experimental conditions influence behavior, task outcome and interpretation. Thus, an ostensibly simple behavioral task can entail high levels of complexity, demonstrating the need for careful dissection of behavior into its subcomponents when studying the underlying neurobiology.",

Two tACS conditions were administered in separate sessions: in-phase tACS, where electrical currents delivered to the rIFG and preSMA had a 0{degrees} phase difference, and anti-phase tACS, where currents had a 180{degrees} phase difference. Stop-signal task performance was assessed before and after tACS. We found significant improvements in response inhibition that were not due to the phase of the tACS applied. There were also no significant changes in rIFG-preSMA phase connectivity in either age group from in- or anti-phase tACS. Furthermore, we did not observe significant differences in rIFG-preSMA phase connectivity between successful and unsuccessful inhibition, which suggests that rIFG-preSMA phase-coupling might not underlie effective response inhibition. The results offer insight into the neurophysiology of response inhibition and contribute to the future development of non-pharmacological interventions aimed at alleviating age-related declines in cognitive function.",

    "abstract": "The immense diversity of plumage coloration exhibited by birds is the result of either pigments deposited in the feathers or microstructural arrangements of feather barbules. Some of the most common pigments are carotenoids that produce bright yellow, orange and red colors. Carotenoids differ from other pigments since birds cannot synthesize them de novo and must obtain them from the diet. Carotenoid pigments are usually associated with signaling and sexual selection, although they also have antioxidant properties and play a role in the immune response. Here we hypothesize that carotenoid-dependent plumage coloration functions as a signal of a males tendency to invest in offspring care because they play an important role in the self-maintenance and may provide key information about individual quality; allowing females to obtain information about a males tendency to invest in offspring care. Using phylogenetic comparative analyses across 350 passerine birds we show that species that consume carotenoid-rich foods have more carotenoid-dependent plumage coloration than species with carotenoid-poor diets. In addition, carotenoid-dependent plumage coloration is associated with a decreased male investment in offspring care. Our results suggest investment into carotenoid-dependent plumage coloration trades off against male investment into offspring care and will likely have broad implications for our understanding of the ecological contexts that facilitate various evolutionary processes such as sexual selection or signaling associated with plumage colors.",

    "abstract": "Ancient DNA (aDNA) can prove a valuable resource when investigating the evolutionary relationships between ancient and modern populations. Performing demographic inference using datasets that include aDNA samples however, requires statistical methods that explicitly account for the differences in drift expected among a temporally distributed sample. Such drift due to temporal structure can be challenging to discriminate from admixture from an unsampled, or \"ghost\", population, which can give rise to very similar summary statistics and confound methods commonly used in population genetics. Sequence data from ancient individuals also have unique characteristics, including short fragments, increased sequencing-error rates, and often limited genome-coverage that poses further challenges. Here we present a novel and conceptually simple approach for assessing questions of population continuity among a temporally distributed sample. We note that conditional on heterozygote sites in an individual genome at a particular point in time, the mean proportion of derived variants at those sites in other individuals has different expectations forwards in time and backwards in time. The difference in these processes enables us to construct a statistic that can detect population continuity in a temporal sample of genomes. We can show that the statistic is sensitive to historical admixture events from unsampled populations. Simulations are used to evaluate the power of this approach. We investigate a set of ancient genomes from Early Neolithic Scandinavia to assess levels of population continuity to an earlier Mesolithic individual. Individuals from hunter-gathering Neolithic Pitted Ware culture show marked continuity with the Mesolithic individual, whereas the contemporary Neolithic individuals from the and farming Funnel Beaker culture display much less continuity.",
