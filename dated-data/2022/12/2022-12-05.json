    "abstract": "Training motor imagery (MI) and motor observation (MO) tasks is being intensively exploited to promote brain plasticity in the context of post-stroke rehabilitation strategies. The desired brain plasticity mechanisms may benefit from the use of closed-loop neurofeedback, embedded in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) to provide an alternative non-muscular channel. These can be further augmented through embodied feedback delivered through virtual reality (VR). Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to map brain activation elicited by a VR-based MI-MO BCI task called NeuRow and compared with a conventional non-VR, and MI-only, task based on the Graz BCI paradigm. We found that, in healthy adults, NeuRow elicits stronger brain activation when compared to the Graz task, as well as to an overt motor execution task, recruiting large portions of the parietal and occipital cortices in addition to the motor and premotor cortices. In particular, NeuRow activates the mirror neuron system (MNS), associated with action observation, as well as visual areas related with visual attention and motion processing. We studied a cohort of healthy adults including younger and older subgroups, and found no significant age-related effects in the measured brain activity. Overall, our findings suggest that the virtual representation of the arms in a bimanual MI-MO task engage the brain beyond conventional MI tasks, even in older adults, which we propose could be explored for effective neurorehabilitation protocols.",

    "abstract": "N-terminal phosphorylation at residues T3 and S13 is believed to have important beneficial implications for the biological and pathological properties of mutant huntingtin, where IKBKB was identified as a candidate regulator of huntingtin N-terminal phosphorylation. The paucity of mechanistic information on IKK pathways, together with the lack of sensitive methods to quantify endogenous huntingtin phosphorylation, prevented detailed study of the role of IKBKB in Huntingtons disease. Using novel ultrasensitive assays, we demonstrate that IKBKB can regulate endogenous S13 huntingtin phosphorylation in a manner dependent on its kinase activity and known regulators. We found that the ability of IKBKB to phosphorylate endogenous huntingtin S13 is mediated through a non-canonical IRF3-mediated IKK-pathway, distinct from the established involvement of IKBKB in mutant huntingtins pathological mechanisms mediated via the canonical pathway. Furthermore, increased huntingtin S13 phosphorylation by IKBKB resulted in decreased aggregation of mutant huntingtin in cells, again dependent on its kinase activity. These findings point to a non-canonical IKK-pathway linking S13 huntingtin phosphorylation to the pathological properties of mutant huntingtin aggregation, thought to be significant to Huntingtons disease.",

    "abstract": "Long-lasting pain stimuli can trigger maladaptive changes in the spinal cord, reminiscent of plasticity associated with memory formation. Metabolic coupling between astrocytes and neurons has been implicated in neuronal plasticity and memory formation in the CNS, but neither its involvement in pathological pain nor in spinal plasticity has been tested. Here, we report a novel form of neuroglia signaling involving spinal astrocytic glycogen dynamics triggered by persistent noxious stimulation via upregulation of the metabolic signaling molecule PTG exclusively in spinal astrocytes. PTG drove glycogen build-up in astrocytes, and blunting glycogen accumulation and turnover by Ptg gene deletion reduced pain-related behaviors and promoted faster recovery by shortening pain maintenance. Furthermore, mechanistic analyses revealed that glycogen dynamics is a critically required process for maintenance of pain by facilitating neuronal plasticity in spinal lamina 1 neurons. Finally, metabolic analysis indicated that glycolysis and lactate transfer between astrocytes and neurons fuels spinal neuron hyperexcitability.\n\nSpinal glycogen-metabolic cascades therefore hold therapeutic potential to alleviate pathological pain.",

    "abstract": "The visual signal processing in the retina requires the precise organization of diverse neuronal types working in concert. We performed spatial transcriptomic profiling of over 100,000 cells from the mouse retina, uncovering the spatial distribution of all major retina cell types with over 100 cell subtypes. Our data revealed that the retina is organized in a laminar structure at the major cell type and subgroup level, both of which has strong correlation with the birth order of the cell. In contrast, overall random dispersion of cells within sub-laminar layers indicates that retinal mosaics are driven by dendritic field patterning rather than neuron soma placement. Through the integration of single cell transcriptomic and spatial data, we have generated the first comprehensive spatial single cell reference atlas of the mouse retina, a resource to the community and an essential step toward gaining a comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of retinal function.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/518972v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (76K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc0eaforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@480731org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d0221borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6f5894_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Our sense of the passage of time flexibly adapts to the statistical properties of the temporal context. Humans and non-human species exhibit a perceptual bias towards the mean of durations previously observed as well as serial dependence, a perceptual bias towards the duration of recently processed events. Here we asked whether those two phenomena arise from a unitary mechanism or reflect the operation of two distinct systems that adapt separately to the global and local statistics of the environment. We employed a set of duration reproduction tasks in which the target duration was sampled from distributions with different variances and means. The central tendency and serial dependence biases were jointly modulated by the range and the variance of the prior. These effects were well-captured by a unitary mechanism model in which temporal expectancies are updated after each trial based on perceptual observations. Alternative models that assume separate mechanisms for global and local contextual effects failed to capture the empirical results.\n\nTeaserTime perception of humans is shaped by a common mechanism that is sensitive to short-term and long-term environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "RationaleExperimental and clinical observations are advancing immunotherapies to clinical trial in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, comprehensive mapping of the immune landscape in and around pulmonary arteries (PAs) in lung tissue is necessary to predict how immune cells might induce pulmonary vascular pathology. While more severe vascular pathology is reported in BMPR2 mutant patients classified as hereditary (H)PAH, the relationship to specific immune cell subsets has not been established. Emerging high throughput approaches such as multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight (MIBI-TOF) that labels antibodies with mass elements enables the study of multiple cells and states of activation in the same tissue section.\n\nMethodsWe applied MIBI-TOF to compare PAs and surrounding tissue from unused donor lungs with PAH lungs that were diagnosed as idiopathic (IPAH) or HPAH.\n\nMeasurementsWe measured the number and proximity of immune cells to vascular lesions and to each other. Immune cell subsets that tracked with vascular pathology were interrogated ex vivo for stimulation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation.\n\nResultsMassive immune infiltration in I/HPAH was observed with intramural infiltration linked to PA occlusive changes. The presence of CD11c+DCs expressing SAMHD1, TIM-3 and IDO-1 within immune enriched microenvironments and neutrophils were associated with greater immune activation in HPAH. CD11c-DC3s (mo-DC-like cells) were linked to inflamed endothelial cells and proliferating SMCs. Co-culture studies reinforced a causal relationship between neutrophil extracellular vesicles and mo-DCs in mediating PASMC proliferation.\n\nConclusionsThese findings merit consideration in predicting and assessing the efficacy of immunotherapies for PAH.",

A massive die-off of Schreibers bent-winged bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in the Iberian Peninsula in 2002 led to its discovery.\n\nStudies with recombinant and wild-type LLOV isolates confirmed the susceptibility of human-derived cell lines and primary human macrophages to LLOV infection in vitro. Based on these data, LLOV is now considered as a potential zoonotic virus with unknown pathogenicity to humans and bats.\n\nWe examined bat samples from Italy for the presence of LLOV in an area outside of the currently known distribution range of the virus. We detected one positive sample from 2020, sequenced the complete coding sequence of the viral genome and established an infectious isolate of the virus. In addition, we performed the first comprehensive evolutionary analysis of the virus, using the Spanish, Hungarian and the Italian sequences.\n\nThe most important achievement of this article is the establishment of an additional infectious LLOV isolate from a bat sample using the SuBK12-08 cells, demonstrating that this cell line is highly susceptible to LLOV infection. These results further confirms the role of these bats as the host of this virus, possibly throughout their entire geographic range. This is an important result to further understand the role of bats as the natural hosts for zoonotic filoviruses.",

    "abstract": "Tick-borne viruses remain a substantial zoonotic risk worldwide, so knowledge of the diversity of tick viruses has potential health consequences. Despite their importance, large amounts of sequences in public datasets from tick meta-genomic and -transcriptomic projects remain unannotated, sequence data that could contain undocumented viruses. Through data mining and bioinformatic analyses of more than 37,800 public meta-genomic and -transcriptomic datasets, we found 83 unannotated contigs exhibiting high identity with known tick viruses. These putative viral contigs were classified into three RNA viral families (Alphatetraviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Chuviridae) and one DNA viral family (Asfaviridae). After manual checking of quality and dissimilarity toward other sequences in the dataset, these 83 contigs were reduced to five putative novel Alphatetra-like viral contigs, four putative novel Orthomyxo-like viral contigs, and one Chu-like viral contig which clustered with known tick-borne viruses, forming a separate clade within the viral families. We further attempted to assess which previously known tick viruses likely represent zoonotic risks and thus deserve further investigation. We ranked the human infection potential of 136 known tick-borne viruses using a genome composition-based machine learning model. We found five high-risk tick-borne viruses (Langat virus, Lonestar tick chuvirus 1, Grotenhout virus, Taggert virus, and Johnston Atoll virus) that have not been known to infect human and two viral families (Nairoviridae and Phenuiviridae) that contain a large proportion of potential zoonotic tick-borne viruses. This adds to the knowledge of tick virus diversity and highlights the importance of surveillance of newly emerging tick-borne diseases.\n\nImportanceTicks are important hosts of pathogens. Despite this, numerous tick-borne viruses are still unknown or poorly characterised. To overcome this, we re-examined currently known tick-borne viruses and identified putative novel viruses associated with ticks in public datasets. Using genome-based machine learning approach, we predicted five high-risk tick-borne viruses that have not yet been reported to cause human infections. Additionally, we highlighted two viral families, Nairoviridae and Phenuiviridae, which are potential public health threats. Our analysis also revealed 10 putative novel RNA viral contigs clustered with known tick-borne viruses. Our study highlights the importance of monitoring ticks and the viruses they carry in endemic areas to prevent and control zoonotic infectious disease outbreaks. To achieve this, we advocate for a multidisciplinary approach within a One Health and EcoHealth framework that considers the relationship between zoonotic disease outbreaks and their hosts, humans, and the environment.",

The diversity of chromosomally-encoded ARE-ABCFs is far from being fully experimentally explored. Here we characterise phylogenetically diverse genome-encoded ABCFs from Actinomycetia (Ard1 from Streptomyces capreolus, producer of the nucleoside antibiotic A201A), Bacilli (VmlR2 from soil bacterium Neobacillus vireti) and Clostridia (CplR from Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium sporogenes and Clostridioides difficile). We demonstrate that Ard1 is a narrow spectrum ARE-ABCF that specifically mediates self-resistance against nucleoside antibiotics. The single-particle cryo-EM structure of a VmlR2-ribosome complex allows us to rationalise the resistance spectrum of this ARE-ABCF that is equipped with an unusually long antibiotic resistance determinant (ARD) subdomain. We show that CplR contributes to intrinsic pleuromutilin, lincosamide and streptogramin A resistance in Clostridioides, and demonstrate that C. difficile CplR (CDIF630_02847) synergises with the transposon-encoded 23S ribosomal RNA methyltransferase Erm to grant high levels of antibiotic resistance to the C. difficile 630 clinical isolate. Finally, assisted by our novel tool for detection of upstream open reading frames, we dissect the translational attenuation mechanism that controls the induction of cplR expression upon an antibiotic challenge.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging pathogen responsible for more than 20 million cases of acute hepatitis globally per annum. Healthy individuals typically have a self-limiting infection, however, mortality rates in some populations such as pregnant women can reach 30%. A detailed understanding of the virus lifecycle is lacking, mainly due to limitations in experimental systems. In this regard, the cyclophilins are an important family of proteins that have peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity and play roles in the replication of a number of positive-sense RNA viruses, including hepatotropic viruses such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). Cyclophilin A (CypA) and cyclophilin B (CypB) are the two most abundant human cyclophilins in hepatocytes and are therefore potential targets for pan-viral therapeutics. Here, we investigated the importance of CypA and CypB for HEV genome replication using a sub-genomic replicon system. This system removes the requirements for viral entry and packaging and therefore allows for the sensitive measurement of viral genome replication in isolation. Using pharmacological inhibition by cyclosporine A (CsA), known to suppress HCV replication, and silencing by shRNA we find that CypA and CypB are not essential for replication of genotype 1 or 3 HEV replication. However, we find that silencing of CypB reduces replication of genotype 1 HEV in some cells, but not genotype 3. These data suggests HEV is atypical in its requirements for cyclophilin for viral genome replication and that this phenomenon could be genotype specific.",

This, combined with the exacerbated use of antibiotics in human and animal health promotes the expansion of the soil resistome. Considering the urgent need for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), we aimed to evaluate how different land practices (urban, farming and forest) can affect the soil resistome and the dynamics of their bacterial communities. We collected eight soil samples from different locations in the countryside of Sao Paulo (Brazil), assessed the community profiles based on 16S rRNA sequencing and analyzed the soil metagenomes based on shotgun sequencing. Our results highlight differences in the communities structure and their dynamics which were correlated with land practices. Additionally, differences were observed in the abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs) across studied soils, where a higher presence and homogeneity of vanRO, mtrA and rbpA genes were detected in livestock soils. We observed that Staphylococcus and Bacillus are positively correlated with each other and are markers for agricultural communities. Moreover, the abundance and diversity of ARGs and VFs observed in farming soils raises concerns regarding the potential spread of these genes in the environment. Together, our findings reinforce the importance and urgency of AMR surveillance in the environment, especially in soils undergoing deep land use transformations due to anthropic activity.",

    "abstract": "Due to their relatively small size and the lack of housekeeping genes, bacterial plasmids are very convenient models for studying DNA replication. So, for a long time, they had been intensively studied in this regard. Unfortunately, only a limited number of model plasmid replication systems were analyzed in detail. In the era of high-throughput DNA sequencing, we are faced with an increasing gap in our knowledge of bacterial plasmid replication and a rapidly growing number of deposited new plasmid genome sequences. For this reason, we decided to investigate the replication system of the pIGMS31 plasmid, a representative of the newly described pHW126-like plasmids family. They are small replicons isolated from different clinical and environmental strains of Gamma proteobacteria. Whole shares unique replication modules with no significant similarities to known model plasmid replication systems. In this study, we identified and characterized the basic elements of the pIGMS31 replication module. Studies on regulatory mechanisms of replication initiation of this plasmid as well as on pIGMS31 replication mode were also performed. We revealed that the pIGMS31 replication module is composed of elements typical for both theta and rolling circle replicons. This mosaic structure is reflected in the unique course of replication of this plasmid, with both modes of replication. What is more, our results led us to conclude that pHW126-like plasmids, despite DNA sequence similarity, are a highly diverse group of replicons.",

    "abstract": "Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy (FM) are two popular and ever improving methods for high-resolution imaging of biological samples. In recent years, the combination of these two techniques into one correlated workflow has gained attention as a promising route towards contextualizing and enriching cryo-TEM imagery. A problem that is often encountered in the combination of these methods is that of light-induced damage to the sample during fluorescence imaging that renders the sample structure unsuitable for TEM imaging. In this paper, we describe how absorption of light by TEM sample support grids leads to sample damage, and we systematically explore the importance of parameters of grid design. We explain how, by changing the grid geometry and materials, one can increase the maximum illumination power density in fluorescence microscopy by up to an order of magnitude, and demonstrate the significant improvements in super-resolution image quality that are enabled by the selection of support grids that are optimally suited for correlated microscopy.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is essential for long-term potentiation (LTP) of excitatory synapses that is linked to learning and memory. In this study, we focused on understanding how interactions between CaMKII and the actin crosslinking protein -actinin-2 underlie long-lasting changes in dendritic spine architecture. We found that association of the two proteins was unexpectedly elevated following stimulation of NMDA receptors to trigger structural LTP in primary hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, disruption of interactions between the two proteins prevented the accumulation of enlarged mushroom-type dendritic spines following NMDA receptor activation. -actinin-2 binds to the regulatory segment of CaMKII. Calorimetry experiments, and a crystal structure of -actinin-2 EF hands 3 and 4 in complex with the CaMKII regulatory segment, indicate that the regulatory segment of autoinhibited CaMKII is not fully accessible to -actinin-2. Pull-down experiments show that occupation of the CaMKII substrate binding groove by GluN2B markedly increases -actinin-2 access to the CaMKII regulatory segment. Overall, our study provides new mechanistic insight into the molecular basis of structural LTP and reveals an added layer of sophistication to the function of CaMKII.",

    "abstract": "A key pathological hallmark in >97% of all Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) cases is the cytoplasmic mislocalization and aggregation of a nuclear RNA binding protein, TDP-43. Driving clearance of cytoplasmic TDP-43 reduces toxicity in various ALS models, though how TDP-43 clearance is regulated remains controversial. To address this, we conducted an unbiased yeast genome-wide screen using high-throughput dot blots to identify genes that affect TDP-43 levels. Our screen identified ESCRT complex factors, which induce membrane invagination (particularly at multi-vesicular bodies; MVBs) and K63-linked ubiquitination as key facilitators of TDP-43 endolysosomal clearance. TDP-43 co-localized and bound Rsp5/NEDD4 and ESCRT proteins, and perturbations to either increased TDP-43 aggregation and accumulation. NEDD4 also ubiquitinates TDP-43. Lastly, TDP-43 accumulation caused formation of \"giant\" MVBs which could reflect a pathological consequence of TDP-43 pertinent to ALS. Our studies shed light on endolysosomal-mediated cytoplasmic protein degradation, which likely impacts multiple substrates, and may be a target for novel ALS therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe role that larval predators play in regulating the population of malaria vectors remains relatively unknown. This study aimed to investigate the common predators that co-exist with Anopheles funestus group larvae and evaluate factors that influence their abundance in rural south-eastern Tanzania.\n\nMethodsMosquito larvae and predators were sampled concurrently using standard dipper (350 ml) or 10 L bucket in nine villages in southern Tanzania. Predators were identified using standard identification keys. All positive habitats were geo-located and their physical features characterized. Water physicochemical parameters such as dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS) and temperature were also recorded.\n\nResultsA total of 85 previously identified An. funestus aquatic habitats were sampled for larvae and potential predators. A total of 8,295 predators were sampled. Of these Coenagrionidae 57.7% (n=4785), Corixidae 12.8% (n=1,060), Notonectidae 9.9% (n=822), Aeshnidae 4.9% (n=405), Amphibian 4.5% (n=370), Dytiscidae 3.8% (n=313) were common. A total of 5,260 mosquito larvae were sampled, whereby Anopheles funestus group were 60.3% (n= 3,170), Culex spp. 24.3% (n= 1,279), An. gambie s.l. 8.3% (n= 438) and other anophelines 7.1% (n= 373). Permanent and aquatic habitats larger than 100m2 were positively associated with An. funestus group larvae (P<0.05) and predator abundance (P<0.05). Habitats with submerged vegetation were negative associated with An. funestus group larvae (P<0.05). Only dissolved oxygen (DO) was positively and significantly affect the abundance of An. funestus group larvae (P<0.05). While predators abundance were not impacted by all physicochemical parameters.\n\nConclusionSix potential predator families were common in aquatic habitats of An. funestus larvae group. Additional studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy of different predators on larval density and adult fitness traits. Interventions leveraging the interaction between mosquitoes and predators can be established to disrupt the transmission potential and survival of the An. funestus mosquitoes.",

Here we utilized a common garden and reciprocal transplant experiment using parthenogenetic lines of D. coccinellae presented with three different host ladybeetle species of varying sizes, across multiple generations to investigate heritability, plasticity, and environmental covariation of body size. We expected positively correlated parent-offspring parasitoid regressions, indicative of heritable size variation, from unilineal (parent and offspring reared on same host species) lines, since these restrict environmental variation in phenotypes. In contrast, because multilineal (parent and offspring reared on different host species) lines would induce phenotypic plasticity of clones reared in varying environments, we expected negatively correlated parent-offspring parasitoid regressions. Contrary to expectations, our results indicate (1) little heritable variation in body size, (2) strong independence of offspring size on the host environment, (3) a consistent signal of size-host tradeoff wherein small mothers produced larger offspring, and vice versa, independent of host environment. Our study offers support for a constrained fecundity advantage model of Copes Law, wherein D. coccinellae maintains phenotypic plasticity in body size despite parthenogenetic reproduction.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDefensive symbionts in the host microbiome can confer protection from infection or reduce the harms of being infected by a parasite. Defensive symbionts are therefore promising agents of biocontrol that could be used to control or ameliorate the impact of infectious diseases. Previous theory has shown how symbionts can evolve along the parasitism-mutualism continuum to confer greater or lesser protection to their hosts, and in turn how hosts may coevolve with their symbionts to potentially form a mutualistic relationship. However, the consequences of introducing a defensive symbiont for parasite evolution and how the symbiont may coevolve with the parasite have received relatively little theoretical attention. Here, we investigate the ecological and evolutionary implications of introducing a tolerance-conferring defensive symbiont into an established host-parasite system. We show that while the defensive symbiont may initially have a positive impact on the host population, parasite and symbiont evolution tend to have a net negative effect on the host population in the long-term. This is because the introduction of the defensive symbiont always selects for an increase in parasite virulence and may cause diversification into high- and low-virulence strains. Even if the symbiont experiences selection for greater host protection, this simply increases selection for virulence in the parasite, resulting in a net negative effect on the host population. Our results therefore suggest that tolerance-conferring defensive symbionts may be poor biocontrol agents for population-level infectious disease control.\n\nLO_SCPLOWAYC_SCPLOW SO_SCPLOWUMMARYC_SCPLOWDefensive symbionts - microbes that confer protection to a host against a harmful parasite - are found throughout the natural world and represent promising candidates for biological control to combat infectious diseases. Symbionts can protect their hosts through a variety of mechanisms that may prevent infection (resistance) or increase survival following infection (tolerance), yet our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary impact of defensive symbionts on parasites is limited. Moreover, few theoretical predictions exist for how defensive symbionts are likely to evolve in the presence of parasites, and for the net effect on the host population. Using a mathematical model where defensive symbionts reduce parasite virulence (harm to the host), we investigate the impact of their introduction on the evolution of parasite virulence, how selection increases or decreases host protection, and whether such symbionts are beneficial for the host population. We find that this form of defensive symbiosis always selects for higher parasite virulence and that it can cause the parasite to diversify into high and low virulence strains which specialise on different host subpopulations. Crucially, we show that the introduction of a defensive symbiont will always lead to a long-term reduction in host population size even if they are beneficial in the short-term. Together, our results show that defensive symbionts can have a strong impact on the evolution of virulence and that this form of host protection is not robust, indicating that tolerance-conferring symbionts are likely to be poor candidates for biological control of infectious diseases at the population level.",

The two sister species Danio rerio and Danio aesculapii show divergent patterns of horizontal stripes and vertical bars that are partly caused by the evolution of the potassium channel gene kcnj13. In D. rerio, kcnj13 is required in melanophores for interactions with xanthophores and iridophores, which cause location-specific pigment cell shapes and thereby influence colour pattern and contrast. Here, we show that cis-regulatory rather than protein coding changes underlie kcnj13 evolution between the two species. D. aesculapii express lower kcnj13 levels and exhibit low-contrast patterns similar to D. rerio mutants. Our results suggest that homotypic and heterotypic interactions between the pigment cells and their shapes diverged between species by quantitative changes in kcnj13 expression during pigment pattern diversification.",

    "abstract": "Detection of the body fluid present at a crime scene is essential for any forensic investigation. Amongst all the body fluids (sweat, semen, vaginal fluid, saliva, etc.,) blood is the most frequently encountered evidence at the crime scene. Currently, reagents like benzidine, orthotoluidine, tetramethylbenzidine, phenolphthalein, leucomalachite green, luminol, and fluorescein are used to screen the presence of blood on different surfaces (porous/nonporous). Majority of these tests are based on colorimetric changes owing to the nature of hemoglobin to catalyze the oxidation of chromogenic compounds. Apart from aiding the investigation, these reagents show toxic behavior (DNA damage, carcinogenic, etc.) and false-positive results. Hence, to circumvent this issue, the present study attempts to develop a state-of-art methodology for preliminary blood detection and screening using fluorescein-derived 2,7-dichlorofluorescein di-acetate (DCFDA) dye. It is hereby proposed that the fluorescein-based dye can successfully detect blood and bloodstains aged up to 20 days. Moreover, supplemental experiments have suggested that the dye doesnt interfere with DNA integritycausing any damage to DNA. Parallelly, no false-positive reactions have been observed as tested against similar-looking substances.",

    "abstract": "While photoautotrophic organisms utilize inorganic nitrogen as the nitrogen source, heterotrophic organisms utilize organic nitrogen and thus do not generally have an inorganic nitrogen assimilation pathway. Here we focused on the nitrogen metabolism of Rapaza viridis, a unicellular eukaryote exhibiting kleptoplasty. Although belonging to the lineage of essentially heterotrophic flagellates, R. viridis exploits the photosynthetic products of the kleptoplasts and was therefore suspected to potentially utilize inorganic nitrogen. From the transcriptome data of R. viridis, we identified the gene RvNaRL, which had sequence similarity to nitrate reductases found in plants. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RvNaRL was acquired by a horizontal gene transfer event. To verify its function of the protein product RvNaRL, we established a RNAi mediated knockdown and a CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knockout experiments for the first time in R. viridis and applied them to this gene. The RvNaRL knockdown and knockout cells exhibited significant growth only when ammonium was supplied but, in contrast to the wild-type cells, no substantial growth when nitrate was supplied. Such arrested growth in absence of ammonium was attributed to impaired amino acid synthesis due to the deficiency of nitrogen supply from the nitrate assimilation pathway; this in turn resulted in the accumulation of excess photosynthetic products in the form of cytosolic polysaccharide grains as observed. These results indicate that RvNaRL is certainly involved in nitrate assimilation by R. viridis. Thus, we infer that R. viridis achieved its advanced kleptoplastic strategy owing to a posteriori acquisition of the nitrate assimilation pathway the horizontal gene transfer.",

    "abstract": "NanoLuc, a superior {beta}-barrel fold luciferase, was engineered 10 years ago but the nature of its catalysis remains puzzling. Here experimental and computational techniques were combined, revealing that imidazopyrazinone luciferins bind to an intra-barrel catalytic site but also to an allosteric site shaped on the enzyme surface. Binding to the allosteric site prevents simultaneous binding to the catalytic site, and vice versa, through concerted conformational changes. We demonstrate that restructuration of the allosteric site can dramatically boost the luminescent reaction in the remote active site. Mechanistically, an intra-barrel arginine coordinates the imidazopyrazinone component of luciferin to attack O2 via a radical charge-transfer mechanism, as well as it protonates the excited amide product to secure high emission intensity. Concomitantly, an aspartate, supported by two tyrosines, fine-tune the electronic state of amide product, promoting the formation of the blue color emitter. This information is critical to engineering the next-generation of light-producing biosystems.",

    "abstract": "Efficiency and accuracy are paramount in genome editing. While CRISPR-Cas nucleases are efficient at editing target genes, their accuracy is limited because following DNA cleavage by Cas proteins, error-prone repair mechanisms introduce random mutations. Improving the accuracy of CRISPR-Cas by reducing random repairs using DNA- or RNA-based templates can compromise efficiency. To simultaneously improve both editing efficiency and accuracy, we created a frameshifting genome-editing technology by fusing Cas9 with DNA polymerases. These Frame Editors (FEs) introduce precise and controlled frameshifts into target loci via specific DNA repairs near Cas9-induced cleavage loci. We demonstrate two types of FEs: the insertion-inducing frame editor (iFE) and the deletion-inducing frame editor (dFE). For iFE, DNA polymerase beta (POLB) is fused with Cas9, which increases the frequency of 1-bp insertions. For dFE, T4 DNA polymerase (T4pol) is fused with Cas9, which increases the frequency of 1-bp deletions. Both types of FEs reduce the number of random mutations at target loci compared with Cas9. We show that off-target editing can be reduced by substituting Cas9 with high-fidelity variants, such as HiFi Cas9 or LZ3 Cas9. Thus, FEs can introduce frameshifts into target loci with much improved mutation profiles compared with Cas9 alone and without the requirement for template sequences, offering a new strategy for repairing pathogenic frameshifts.",

    "abstract": "Triacetic acid lactone (TAL) is a platform chemical biosynthesized primarily through decarboxylative Claisen condensation by type III polyketide synthase 2-pyrone synthase (2-PS). However, this reaction suffers from intrinsic energy inefficiency and feedback inhibition by and competition for malonyl-CoA. TAL production through non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation by polyketoacyl-CoA thiolase alleviates many of these disadvantages. We discovered five more thiolases with TAL production activity by exploring homologs of a previously reported polyketoacyl-CoA thiolase, BktB, from Cupriavidus necator. Among them, the BktB homolog from Burkholderia sp. RF2-non_BP3 has [~] 30 times higher in vitro and in vivo TAL production activity and led to [~]10 times higher TAL titer than 2-PS when expressed in Escherichia coli, achieving a titer of 2.8 g/L in fed-batch fermentations. This discovery of a novel polyketoacyl-CoA thiolase with superior TAL production activity paves the way for realization of total biomanufacturing of TAL.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBladder cancer is a heterogenous disease and the emerging knowledge on molecular classification of bladder tumors could have impact to drive treatment decisions based on molecular subtype. Pre-clinical models representing each subtype are needed to test novel therapies. Carcinogen-induced bladder cancer models represent heterogeneous, immune-competent, pre-clinical testing options with many features found in the human disease.\n\nMethodsInvasive bladder tumors were induced in C57BL/6 mice when continuously exposed to N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxbutyl nitrosamine) (BBN) in the drinking water. Tumors were excised and serially passed by subcutaneous implantation into sex-matched syngeneic C57BL/6 hosts. Eight tumor lines were developed and named BBN-induced Urothelium Roswell Park (BURP) tumor lines. The BURP lines were characterized by applying consensus molecular classification to RNA expression, histopathology, and immune profiles by CIBERSORT. Two lines were further characterized for cisplatin response.\n\nResultsEight BURP tumor lines were established with 3 male and 3 female BURP tumor lines, having the basal/squamous (BaSq) molecular phenotype and morphology. BURP-16SR was established from a male mouse and has a stromal-rich (SR) molecular phenotype and a sarcomatoid carcinoma morphology. BURP-19NE was established from a male mouse and has a neuroendocrine (NE)-like molecular phenotype and poorly differentiated morphology. The established BURP tumor lines have unique immune profiles with fewer immune infiltrates compared to their originating BBN-induced tumors. The immune profiles of the BURP tumor lines capture some of the features observed in the molecular classifications of human bladder cancer. BURP-16SR growth was inhibited by cisplatin treatment, while BURP-24BaSq did not respond to cisplatin.\n\nConclusionsThe BURP tumor lines represent several molecular classifications, including basal/squamous, stroma-rich, and NE-like. The stroma-rich (BURP-16SR) and NE-like (BURP-19NE) represent unique immunocompetent models that can be used to test novel treatments in these less common bladder cancer subtypes. Six basal/squamous tumor lines were established from both male and female mice. Overall, the BURP tumor lines have less heterogeneity than the carcinogen-induced tumors and can be used to evaluate treatment response without the confounding mixed response often observed in heterogeneous tumors. Additionally, basal/squamous tumor lines were established and maintained in both male and female mice, thereby allowing these tumor lines to be used to compare differential treatment responses between sexes.",

In our studies we uncover common and distinct structural elements in large Mb-scale chromatin compartments, tumor-essential genes within variable topologically associating domains, and unique patterns of structural variation.

We confirm the presence of known universal fibroblasts and describe novel, potentially pleural-specific, fibroblast subtypes. We also present transcriptomic characterisation of multiple in vitro models of benign and malignant mesothelial cells, and characterise these through comparison with in vivo transcriptomic data. While bulk pleural transcriptomes have been reported previously, this is the first study to provide resolution at single cell level. We expect our pleural cell atlas will prove invaluable to those studying pleural biology and disease.

    "abstract": "BCR-ABL is the oncogenic fusion product of tyrosine kinase ABL1 and a highly frequent driver of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). The kinase activity of BCR-ABL is strongly elevated, however changes of substrate specificity in comparison to wild-type ABL1 kinase are less well characterized. Here, we heterologously expressed full-length BCR-ABL kinases in yeast. We exploited the proteome of living yeast as in vivo phospho-tyrosine substrate for assaying human kinases specificity. Phospho-proteomic analysis of ABL1 and BCR-ABL isoforms p190 and p210 yielded a high-confidence dataset of 1127 phospho-tyrosine sites on 821 yeast proteins. We used this data set to generate linear phosphorylation site motifs for ABL1 and the oncogenic ABL1 fusion proteins. The oncogenic kinases yielded a substantially different linear motif when compared to ABL1. Kinase set enrichment analysis with human pY-sites that have high linear motif scores well recalled BCR-ABL driven cancer cell lines from human phospho-proteome data sets.\n\nHighlightsO_LIFull-length BCR-ABL kinase expression in yeast\nC_LIO_LI1,127 pY-sites on 821 yeast proteins originating from ABL1 and BCR-ABL kinase activity\nC_LIO_LIDistinct linear kinase motif forABL1 and BCR-ABL p190 and p210 isoforms\nC_LIO_LIValidation of the kinase motifs through KSEA of human cancer cell line phospho-proteome data\nC_LI\n\nSignificanceThe fusion protein BCR-ABL is a predominant oncogene in leukemia observed at very high frequency in chronic myeloid leukemia (BCR-ABL p210) and B-cell acute lymphoid (BCR-ABL p190) leukemia. In both cases the malignant transformation is reliant on elevated tyrosine kinase activity, however ABL1 kinase activation as such is not sufficient. At least in part, leukemias may therefore be driven by a specificity switch of the fusion kinase in comparison to the wild-type ABL1.\n\nWe investigated BCR-ABL kinase substrates in yeast through phospho-proteomics and established linear kinase phosphorylation-motifs for the full length BCR-ABL isoforms p210 and p190. These novel motifs differ substantially from the corresponding specificity determinants of wild-type ABL1 kinase, providing direct experimental evidence for altered phosphorylation-specificity of the oncogenic kinase fusion proteins.",

    "abstract": "This paper suggests an explanation for listeners greater tolerance to positive than negative mistuning of the higher tone within an octave pair. It hypothesizes a neural circuit tuned to cancel the lower tone, that also cancels the higher tone if that tone is in tune. Imperfect cancellation is the cue to mistuning of the octave. The circuit involves two neural pathways, one delayed with respect to the other, that feed a coincidence-sensitive neuron via excitatory and inhibitory synapses. A mismatch between the time constants of these two synapses results in an asymmetry in sensitivity to mismatch. Specifically, if the time constant of the delayed pathway is greater than that of the direct pathway, there is a greater tolerance to positive mistuning than to negative mistuning. The model is directly applicable to the harmonic octave (concurrent tones), but extending it to the melodic octave (successive tones) requires additional assumptions that are discussed. The paper reviews evidence from auditory psychophysics and physiology in favor - or against - this explanation.",

    "abstract": "Sign-tracking (ST) describes the propensity to approach and contact a Pavlovian reward cue. By contrast, goal-trackers (GTs) respond to such a cue by retrieving the reward. These behaviors index the presence of opponent cognitive-motivational traits, with STs exhibiting attentional control deficits, behavior dominated by incentive motivational processes, and vulnerability for addictive drug taking. Attentional control deficits in STs were previously attributed to attenuated cholinergic signaling, resulting from deficient translocation of intracellular choline transporters (CHTs) into synaptosomal plasma membrane. Here we investigated a post-translational modification of CHTs - poly-ubiquitination - and tested the hypothesis that elevated cytokine signaling in STs contributes to CHT modification. We demonstrated that intracellular CHTs, but not plasma membrane CHTs, are highly ubiquitinated in male and female sign-tracking rats when compared with GTs. Moreover, levels of cytokines measured in cortex and striatum, but not spleen, were higher in STs than in GTs. Activation of the innate immune system by systemic administration of the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) elevated ubiquitinated CHT levels in cortex and striatum of GTs only, suggesting ceiling effects in STs. In spleen, LPS increased levels of most cytokines in both phenotypes. In cortex, LPS particularly robustly increased levels of the chemokines CCL2 and CXCL10. Phenotype-specific increases were restricted to GTs, again suggesting ceiling effects in STs. These results indicate that interactions between elevated brain immune modulator signaling and CHT regulation are essential components of the neuronal underpinnings of the addiction vulnerability trait indexed by sign-tracking.\n\nSignificance StatementSign-tracking rats (STs) have emerged as a fruitful animal model for determining the neuro-behavioral foundations, including the cholinergic-attentional control deficits, which heighten the risk for the manifestation of addictive behaviors. The results from the present experiments suggest that, in STs, elevated levels of neuro-immune signaling interact with a post-translational modification of choline transporters that yields a relatively low transporter capacity. Furthermore, the effects of activation of the innate immune system, by administrating the endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, mechanistically supported such an interaction. The results extend research on the neuronal vulnerabilities for addictive behaviors to the role of neuro-immune signaling and suggests a new role of neuro-immune modulators in influencing complex cognitive-motivational traits.",

    "abstract": "Cortical neurons in primary sensory cortex carry not only sensory but also behavior-related information. However, it remains unclear how these types of information emerge and are integrated with one another over learning and what the relative contribution of activity in individual cells versus neuronal populations is in this process. Current evidence supports two opposing views of learning-related changes: 1) sensory information increases in primary cortex or 2) sensory information remains stable in primary cortex but its readout efficiency in association cortices increases. Here, we investigate these questions in primary sensory cortex during learning of a sensory task. Over the course of weeks, we imaged neuronal activity at different depths within layers 2 and 3 of the mouse vibrissal primary somatosensory cortex (vS1) before, during, and after training on a whisker-based object-localization task. We leveraged information theoretical analysis to quantify stimulus and behavior-related information in vS1 and estimate how much neural activity encoding sensory information is used to inform perceptual choices as sensory learning progresses. We also quantified the extent to which these types of information are supported by an individual neuron or population code. We found that, while sensory information rises progressively from the start of training, choice information is only present in the final stages of learning and is increasingly supported by a population code. Moreover, we demonstrate that not only the increase in available information, but also a more efficient readout of such information in primary sensory cortex mediate sensory learning. Together, our results highlight the importance of primary cortical neurons in perceptual learning.",

To elucidate the impact of sex-specific microglia heterogenicity to the susceptibility of neuronal stress, we analysed the dynamic changes in shape and motility occurring in primary mouse microglia following pro-inflammatory or neurotoxic insults, thus finding sex-specific responses of microglial subpopulations. Male microglia exhibited a pro-inflammatory phenotype, whereas female microglia showed enhanced neuroprotective capabilities associated with the activation of Nrf2 detoxification pathway in neurons. The sex difference in neuroprotective functions is lost by inhibition of glucocerebrosidase, the product of the GBA1 gene, mutations of which are the major risk factor for Parkinsons disease (PD). This finding is consistent with the increased risk of PD observed in female carriers of GBA1 mutation, when compared with wild type population, suggesting a role for microglial functionality in the etiopathogenesis of PD-GBA1.",

Our data show a striking coordination of rapidly fluctuating signal in the DS, carrying information across dopamine levels, with a slower signal in the VS, consisting mainly of slow-paced transients. Importantly, these release dynamics correlated with discrete behavioral motifs, such as turns, running and grooming on a subsecond-to-minutes time scale. Disruption of dopamine dynamics with cocaine caused randomization of action selection sequencing and disturbance of DS-VS coordination. The data suggest that distinct dopamine dynamics of DS and VS jointly encode behavioral sequences during unconstrained activity with DS modulating the stringing together of actions and VS the signal to initiate and sustain the selected action.\n\nSignificance StatementNew genetically encoded dopamine sensors offer unprecedented temporal resolution for measurement of dopamine release dynamics across different brain regions over extended periods. In this study, we use the dopamine sensor dLight1.3b to decipher the role of dopamine release dynamics in the dorsal (DS) and ventral striatum (VS) of mice during simple, self-paced exploratory behavior. By AI-based splitting of behavioral kinematics into individual motifs, we link differential but highly cooperative dopamine release dynamics of DS and VS with movements on a subsecond-to-minutes time scales. In addition to coupling region-specific dopamine dynamics to behavioral sequences, our study demonstrates the strength of a machine learning-based data analysis pipeline that can be readily applied to other neurotransmitters for which genetically encoded biosensors are available.",

    "abstract": "Ketamine is shown to enhance excitatory synaptic drive in the hippocampus, which is presumed to underlie its rapid antidepressant effects. Moreover, ketamines therapeutic actions are likely mediated by enhancing neuronal Ca2+ signaling. However, ketamine is a noncompetitive NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist that inhibits excitatory synaptic transmission and postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling. Thus, it is a puzzling question how ketamine enhances glutamatergic and Ca2+ activity in neurons to induce rapid antidepressant effects while blocking NMDARs in the hippocampus. Here, we find that ketamine treatment for one hour in cultured mouse hippocampal neurons significantly reduces calcineurin activity to elevate AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunit GluA1 phosphorylation. This phosphorylation ultimately induces the expression of Ca2+- Permeable, GluA2-lacking, and GluA1-containing AMPARs (CP-AMPARs). Such ketamine-induced expression of CP-AMPARs enhances glutamatergic activity and synaptic plasticity in cultured hippocampal neurons. When a sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine is given to mice, it increases synaptic GluA1 levels, but not GluA2, and GluA1 phosphorylation in the hippocampus within one hour after treatment. These changes are likely mediated by ketamine-induced reduction of calcineurin activity in the hippocampus. Using the open field and tail suspension tests, we demonstrate that a low dose of ketamine rapidly reduces anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors in both male and female mice. However, when in vivo treatment of a CP-AMPAR antagonist abolishes the ketamines effects on animals behavior. We thus discover that ketamine at the low dose promotes the expression of CP-AMPARs via reduction of calcineurin activity in the hippocampus, which in turn enhances synaptic strength to induce rapid antidepressant actions.",

We assessed age-dependent changes in interactions within the DMN and between the DMN with other brain areas, and correlations of these interactions with a battery of neuropsychological tests to formulate a macroscopic model of ageing.\n\nUsing a novel multivariate analysis method, enabling determination of directed pathways, on resting-state functional MRI data from fifty young and thirty-one old healthy individuals, we identified directed intra- and inter-DMN directed pathways that differed between the groups and used their correlations with neuropsychological tests to infer their behavioral meaning.\n\nPathways connecting the DMN with visual and limbic regions in old subjects engaged at BOLD low frequency and involved the dorsal PCC. In young subjects, they were at high frequency and involved the ventral PCC. Pathways combining the sensorimotor (SM) and the DMN, were efferent in young subjects (DMN<SM) and afferent in old subjects (DMN>SM). Most inter-DMN pathways in the old subjects, correlated with reduced speed and working memory and, were DMN efferent (DMN>).\n\nWe suggest a macroscopic model of aging centered in the DMN. It suggests that the reduced sensorimotor efferent, probably brought about from reduced physical activity, and the increased need to control such activities by the mPFC, causes a higher dependency on external versus internal cues. This results in a shift from ventral to dorsal PCC of inter-DMN pathways. Consequently, the model combines physical activity with ageing.",

We analyzed a large amount of coordinate-localized, two-photon imaging data from cerebellar Crus II in mice undergoing \"Go/No-go\" reinforcement learning. Tensor component analysis revealed that a majority of climbing fiber inputs to Purkinje cells were reduced to only four functional components, corresponding to accurate timing control of motor initiation related to a Go cue, cognitive error-based learning, reward processing, and inhibition of erroneous behaviors after a No-go cue. Spatial distribution of these components coincided well with the boundaries of Aldolase-C/zebrin II expression in Purkinje cells, whereas several components are mixed in single neurons. Synchronization within individual components was bidirectionally regulated according to specific task contexts and learning stages.

    "abstract": "Ubiquitination, as one of the most prevalent posttranslational modifications of proteins, enables a tight control on host immune responses. Many viruses hijack the host ubiquitin system to regulate host antiviral responses for their survival. Here, we found that fish pathogen nervous necrosis virus (NNV) recruited an E3 ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 34 (RNF34) to inhibit RLRs-mediated interferons (IFN) response via ubiquitinating TBK1 and IRF3. Ectopic expression of RNF34 greatly enhances NNV replication and prevents IFN production, while deficiency of RNF34 led to the opposite effect. Furthermore, RNF34 targets TBK1 and IRF3 via its RING domain. Of note, the interactions between RNF34 and TBK1 or IRF3 were conserved in different fish species. Mechanically, RNF34 promote K27-linked ubiquitination and degradation of TBK1 and IRF3, which in turn diminishing TBK1-induced translocation of IRF3 from cytoplasm to nucleus. Ultimately, NNV capsid protein (CP) was found directly bind with RNF34 and this interaction was conserved in different fishes, and CP induced TBK1 and IRF3 degradation and IFN suppression was depended on RNF34. Our finding demonstrated a novel mechanism by which NNV CP evaded host innate immunity via RNF34, and provided a potential drug target for the control of NNV infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryUbiquitination plays an essential role in the regulation of innate immune responses to pathogens. NNV, a kind of RNA virus, is the causal agent of a highly destructive disease in a variety of marine and freshwater fish. Previous study reported NNV could hijack the ubiquitin system to manipulate the hosts immune responses, however, how NNV utilizes ubiquitination to facilitate its own replication is not well understood. Here, we identified a novel distinct role of E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF34 as an IFN antagonist to promote NNV infection. Nervous necrosis virus capsid protein utilized RNF34 to target TBK1 and IRF3 for K27 and K48-linked ubiquitination degradation. Importantly, the interactions between RNF34 and CP, TBK1 or IRF3 are conserved in different fishes, suggesting it is a general immune evasion strategy exploited by NNV to target the IFN response via RNF34.",

Oncofetal protein SALL4 is a known oncogene in MDS and its baseline expression level serves as a prognostic biomarker for MDS at the time of diagnosis. In addition, a recent study showed that SALL4 upregulation following hypomethylating agent treatment in MDS patients correlates with poor outcomes. Despite its important mechanistic and diagnostic significance, the cellular identity of bone marrow cells with aberrant SALL4 expression in MDS patients remains unknown.\n\nIn this study, we analyzed MDS bone marrow cells on single cell level by mass cytometry (CyTOF) and found that SALL4 was mainly aberrantly expressed in the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) as well as myeloid lineages. Within the HSPC population from MDS patients, SALL4 and p53 were co-expressed, with the highest co-expressing clones harboring pathogenic TP53 mutations. Overall, our study characterizes for the first time the aberrant SALL4 expression in primary MDS patient samples at a single-cell level. Further studies on the SALL4/p53 network for in-depth mechanistic investigation are needed in the future.\n\nKey PointsSALL4 expression in various MDS BM cells confirmed by mass cytometry (CyTOF).

In this study, we compared stromal populations in matched tissues from the femoral head and neck of 21 human participants using spectral flow cytometry of freshly isolated cells. High-level analysis indicated significant differences in marker distribution between periosteum, articular cartilage, endosteum and bone marrow stromal populations, and identified populations that were highly enriched or unique to specific tissues. Periosteum-enriched markers included CD90 and CD34. Articular cartilage, which has very poor regenerative potential, showed enrichment of multiple markers, including the PDPN+CD73+CD164+ population previously reported to represent human skeletal stem cells. We further characterized periosteal populations by combining CD90 with other strongly expressed markers. CD90+CD34+ cells sorted directly from periosteum showed significant colony-forming unit fibroblasts (CFU-F) enrichment, rapid expansion, and consistent multi-lineage differentiation of clonal populations. In situ, CD90+CD34+ cells include a perivascular population in the outer layer of the periosteum and non-perivascular cells closer to the bone surface. In conclusion, our study indicates considerable diversity in the stromal cell populations in different tissue compartments within the adult human skeleton, and suggests that periosteal stem cells reside within the CD90+CD34+ population.",

    "abstract": "Disease risk prediction based on DNA sequence and transcriptional profile can improve disease screening, prevention, and potential therapeutic approaches by revealing contributing genetic factors and altered networks. Despite identifying many disease-associated DNA variants through genome-wide association studies, distinguishing deleterious non-coding DNA variations remains poor for most common diseases. We previously reported that non-coding variations disrupting cis-overlapping motifs (CisOMs) of opposing transcription factors significantly affect enhancer activity. Analyzing publicly available ChIP-seq data for P53 and cMYC in human embryonic stem cells and mouse embryonic cells showed that [~]344-366 genomic regions are co-occupied by P53 and cMYC. We identified, on average, two CisOMs per region, suggesting that co-occupancy is evolutionarily conserved in vertebrates. Therefore, we designed in vitro experiments to uncover the significance of the co-occupancy and competitive binding and inhibition between P53 and cMYC on target gene expression. We found that treating U2OS cells with doxorubicin increased P53 protein level while reducing cMYC level. In contrast, no change in protein levels was observed in Raji cells. ChIP-seq analysis showed that 16-922 genomic regions were co-occupied by P53 and cMYC before and after treatment, and substitutions of cMYC signals by P53 were detected after doxorubicin treatment in U2OS. Around 187 expressed genes near co-occupied regions were altered at mRNA level according to RNA-seq data. We utilized a computational motif-matching approach to determine that changes in predicted P53 binding affinity by DNA variations in CisOMs of co-occupied elements significantly correlate with alterations in reporter gene expression. We performed a similar analysis using SNPs mapped in CisOMs for P53 and cMYC from ChIP-seq data in U2OS and Raji, and expression of target genes from the GTEx portal. We found a significant correlation between change in motif-predicted cMYC binding affinity by SNPs in CisOMs and gene expression. In conclusion, our study suggests a generally applicable approach to filter etiological non-coding variations associated with P53 and cMYC-dependent diseases.\n\nAuthor SummaryMost DNA variants associated with common complex diseases fall outside the protein-coding regions of the genome, making them hard to detect and relate to a function. Although many computational tools are available for prioritizing functional disease risk variants outside the protein-coding regions of the genome, the precision of prediction of these tools is mostly unreliable and hence not close to cancer risk prediction. This study brings to light a novel way to improve prediction accuracy of publicly available tools by integrating the impact of cis-overlapping binding sites of opposing cancer proteins, such as P53 and cMYC, in their analysis to filter out deleterious DNA variants outside the protein-coding regions of the human genome. Using a biology-based statistical approach, DNA variants within cis-overlapping motifs impacting the binding affinity of opposing transcription factors can significantly alter the expression of target genes and regulatory networks. This study brings us closer to developing a generally applicable approach capable of filtering etiological non-coding variations in co-occupied genomic regions of P53 and cMYC family members to improve disease risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) deletion mutations cause many human diseases and are linked to age-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Mapping the mutation spectrum and quantifying mtDNA deletion mutation frequency is challenging with next generation sequencing methods. We hypothesized that long-read sequencing of human mtDNA across the lifespan would detect a broader spectrum of mtDNA rearrangements and provide a more accurate measurement of their frequency.\n\nResultsWe employed nanopore Cas9-targed sequencing (nCATS) to map and quantitate mtDNA deletion mutations and develop analyses that are fit-for-purpose. We analyzed total DNA from vastus lateralis muscle in 15 males ranging from 20 to 81 years of age and substantia nigra from three 20-year-old and three 79-year-old men. We found that mtDNA deletion mutations detected by nCATS increased exponentially with age and mapped to a wider region of the mitochondrial genome than previously reported. Using simulated data, we observed that large deletions are often reported as chimeric alignments. To address this, we developed two algorithms for deletion identification which yield consistent deletion mapping and identify both previously reported and novel mtDNA deletion breakpoints. The identified mtDNA deletion frequency measured by nCATS correlates strongly with chronological age and predicts the deletion frequency as measured by digital PCR approaches. In substantia nigra, we observed a similar frequency of age-related mtDNA deletions to those observed in muscle samples, but noted a distinct spectrum of deletion breakpoints.\n\nConclusionsNCATS-mtDNA sequencing allows identification of mtDNA deletions on a single molecule level, characterizing the strong relationship between mtDNA deletion frequency and chronological aging.",

    "abstract": "USA300 has remained the dominant community and healthcare associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clone in the United States and in northern South America for at least the past 20 years. In this time, it has experienced epidemic spread in both of these locations. However, its pre-epidemic evolutionary history and origins are incompletely understood. Large sequencing databases, such as NCBI, PATRIC, and Staphopia, contain clues to the early evolution of USA300 in the form of sequenced genomes of USA300 isolates that are representative of lineages that diverged prior to the establishment of the South American (SAE) and North American (NAE) epidemics. In addition, historical isolates collected prior to the emergence of epidemics can help reconstruct early events in the history of this lineage. Here, we take advantage of the accrued, publicly available data, as well as two newly sequenced pre-epidemic historical isolates from 1996, and a very early diverging ACME-negative NAE genome to understand the pre-epidemic evolution of USA300. We use database mining techniques to emphasize genomes similar to pre-epidemic isolates, with the goal of reconstructing the early molecular evolution of the USA300 lineage. Phylogenetic analysis with these genomes confirms that the North American Epidemic and South American Epidemic USA300 lineages diverged from a most recent common ancestor around 1970 with high confidence, and it also pinpoints the independent acquisition events of the of the ACME and COMER loci with greater precision than in previous studies. We solidify evidence for a North American origin of the USA300 lineage and identify multiple introductions of USA300 into South America from North America. Notably, we describe a third major USA300 clade (the pre-epidemic branching clade; PEB1) consisting of both MSSA and MRSA isolates circulating around the world that diverged from the USA300 lineage prior to the establishment of the South American and North American epidemics. We present a detailed analysis of specific sequence characteristics of each of the major clades, and present diagnostic positions that can be used to classify new genomes.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial RadD enzyme is important for multiple genome maintenance pathways, including RecA DNA strand exchange and RecA-independent suppression of DNA crossover template switching. However, much remains unknown about the precise roles of RadD. One potential clue into RadD mechanisms is its direct interaction with the single-stranded DNA binding protein (SSB), which coats single-stranded DNA exposed during genome maintenance reactions in cells. Interaction with SSB stimulates the ATPase activity of RadD. To probe the mechanism and importance of RadD/SSB complex formation, we identified a pocket on RadD that is essential for binding SSB. In a mechanism shared with many other SSB-interacting proteins, RadD uses a hydrophobic pocket framed by basic residues to bind the C-terminal end of SSB. RadD variants that substitute acidic residues for basic residues in the SSB binding site impair RadD/SSB complex formation and eliminate SSB stimulation of RadD ATPase activity in vitro. Mutant E. coli strains carrying charge reversal radD changes display increased sensitivity to DNA damaging agents synergistically with deletions of radA and recG, although the phenotypes of the SSB-binding radD mutants are not as severe a full radD deletion. This suggests that RadD has multiple functions in the cell, with a subset requiring the interaction with SSB.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in renal function and blood pressure have been widely described across many species. Blood pressure dips during sleep and peaks in the early morning. Similarly, glomerular filtration rate, filtered electrolyte loads, urine volume, and urinary excretion all exhibit notable diurnal rhythms, which reflect, in part, the regulation of renal transporter proteins by circadian clock genes. That regulation is sexually dimorphic; as such, sex and time-of-day are not two independent regulators of kidney function and blood pressure. The objective of this study is to assess the effect of sex and administration time on the natriuretic and diuretic effects of loop, thiazide, and K+-sparing diuretics, which are common treatment for hypertension. Loop diuretics inhibit NKCC2 on the apical membrane of the thick ascending limb, thiazide diuretics inhibit NCC on the distal convoluted tubule, and K+-sparing diuretics inhibit ENaC on the connecting tubule and collecting duct. We simulate Na+ transporter inhibition using our sex- and time-of-day-specific computational models of mouse kidney function. Simulations results highlight significant sex and time-of day differences in drug response. Loop diuretics induce larger natriuretic and diuretic effects during the active phase. The natriuretic and diuretic effects of thiazide diuretics exhibit sex and time-of-day differences, whereas these effects of K+-sparing diuretics exhibit significant time-of-day difference in females only. Kaliuretic effect depends on the type of diuretics and time of administration. The present computational models can be a useful tool in chronotherapy, to tailor drug administration time to match the bodys diurnal rhythms to optimize the drug effect.",

    "abstract": "Genome editing requires precision to broadly move on to industrial and clinical applications. For this reason, homologous directed repair (HDR) is one of the preferred methods for small edits, other than knock-outs. However, HDR has low efficiency. Current investigations to enhance HDR have mainly gone in the direction of finding non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) inhibitors. NHEJ is crucial for cellular integrity, then the inhibition of this pathway is detrimental for the correct survival of living entities. In other studies, a second opportunity is given to HDR by targeting the byproducts of NHEJ, using an extra gRNA. In this study, we propose the use of a meiotic factor, PRDM9, to directly enhance homology recombination. Through the exploration of combinatorial factors and donor design, we have established an optimized protocol for HDR. PRDM9-Cas9 fusion combined with CtIP improves HDR/NHEJ ratio. In addition, we have validated this combinatorial approach for small edits through a traffic light reporter system, as well as for longer edits with a split-GFP reporter system.",

However, its mechanism remains poorly understood, which also impedes its application as a cell-division machinery for synthetic cells. Here, we use fluorescence microscopy and Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) to study the in vitro reconstitution of the bacterial protein Dynamin A (DynA) inside liposomes. Upon external reshaping of the liposomes into dumbbells, DynA self-assembles at the membrane neck, resulting in membrane hemi-scission and even full scission. DynA proteins constitute a simple one-component division machinery that is capable of splitting dumbbell-shaped liposomes, marking an important step towards building a synthetic cell.",

Here, we improve on the state of the art for tracking this drift with an algorithm termed DREDge (Decentralized Registration of Electrophysiology Data) with four major contributions. First, we extend previous decentralized methods to exploit multiband information, leveraging the local field potential (LFP), in addition to spikes detected from the action potentials (AP). Second, we show that the LFP-based approach enables registration at sub-second temporal resolution. Third, we introduce an efficient online motion tracking algorithm, allowing the method to scale up to longer and higher spatial resolution recordings, which could facilitate real-time applications. Finally, we improve the robustness of the approach by accounting for the nonstationarities that occur in real data and by automating parameter selection. Together, these advances enable fully automated scalable registration of challenging datasets from both humans and mice.",

Yet, the mechanisms guiding the transition of NSCs from developmental to adult remain unclear. By using nestin-reporter mice deficient for D2, a cyclin expressed mainly postnatally, we show that the aNSC pool is established through D2-dependent proliferation during the first two weeks of life. The absence of D2 allows the normal development of the DG until birth but prevents the postnatal formation of radial glia-like aNSCs. Additionally, retroviral fate mapping demonstrates that aNSCs are born on-site from precursors located in the DG shortly after birth. Altogether, our data suggest that aNSCs are a population distinct from developmental NSCs and thus imply that adult hippocampal neurogenesis is not a mere continuation of development.",

    "abstract": "The spinal cord is of fundamental importance for somatosensory processing and plays a significant role in various pathologies, such as chronic pain. However, knowledge on spinal cord processing in humans is limited due to the vast technical challenges involved in its investigation via non-invasive recording approaches. Here, we aim to address these challenges by developing an electrophysiological approach - based on a high-density electrode-montage - that allows for characterizing spinal cord somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) and combining this with concurrent recordings of the spinal cords input (peripheral nerve action potentials) and output (SEPs in brainstem and cortex). In two separate experiments, we first methodologically validate the approach (including replication and robustness analyses) and then assess its application in the context of a neuroscientific question (integrative processes along the neural hierarchy). Critically, we demonstrate the benefits of multi-channel recordings in terms of enhancing sensitivity via spatial filtering, which also allows for obtaining spinal cord SEPs at the single-trial level. We make use of this approach to demonstrate the feasibility of recording spinal cord SEPs in low-signal scenarios (single-digit stimulation) and - most importantly - to provide evidence for bottom-up signal integration already at the level of the spinal cord. Taken together, our approach of concurrent multi-channel recordings of evoked responses along the neural hierarchy allows for a comprehensive assessment of the functional architecture of somatosensory processing at a millisecond timescale.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in connectomic and neurophysiological tools make it possible to probe whole-brain mechanisms in the mouse that underlie cognition and behavior. Based on experimental data, we developed a large-scale model of the mouse brain for a cardinal cognitive function called working memory, the brains ability to internally hold and process information without sensory input. In the model, interregional connectivity is constrained by mesoscopic connectome data. The density of parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in the model varies systematically across the cortex. We found that the long-range cell type-specific targeting and density of cell classes define working memory representations. A core cortical subnetwork and the thalamus produce distributed persistent activity, and the network exhibits numerous attractor states. Novel cell type-specific graph theory measures predicted the activity patterns and core subnetwork. This work highlights the need for cell type-specific connectomics, and provides a theory and tools to interpret large-scale recordings of brain activity during cognition.",

    "abstract": "The genomes of positive-sense RNA viruses encode polyproteins that are essential for controlling viral replication. These viral polyproteins must undergo proteolysis (also termed polyprotein processing) to generate functional protein units. This proteolysis can be performed by virally-encoded proteases as well as host cellular proteases, and is generally believed to be a key step in regulating viral replication. Hepatitis E virus (HEV), a leading cause of acute viral hepatitis, translates its positive-sense RNA genome to generate a polyprotein, termed pORF1, which is necessary and sufficient for viral genome replication. However, the mechanism of polyprotein processing in HEV remains to be determined. In this study, we aimed to understand processing of this polyprotein and its role in viral replication using a combination of in vitro translation experiments and HEV sub-genomic replicons.\n\nOur data suggest no evidence for a virally-encoded protease or auto-proteolytic activity as in vitro translation predominantly generates unprocessed viral polyprotein precursors. However, seven cleavage sites within the polyprotein (suggested by bioinformatic analysis) are susceptible to the host cellular protease, thrombin. Using a sub-genomic replicon system, we demonstrate that mutagenesis of these sites prevents replication, as does pharmacological inhibition of serine proteases. Overall, our data supports a model where HEV uses host proteases to support its replication and could have uniquely evolved not to rely on a virally-encoded protease for replication.\n\nAuthor summaryPositive-strand RNA viruses produce polyproteins that are cleaved by proteases that control viral replication. The polyproteins of all well studied positive-strand viruses undergo proteolysis in a highly controlled manner to generate functional proteins and regulate the transition from translation to RNA replication. Proteolysis of viral polyproteins is generally performed by virally-encoded proteases, although host cell proteases are used by some viruses. In this report, we provide evidence that suggests that hepatitis E virus, a medically important human pathogen, does not encode a protease and unlike other viral polyproteins cannot undergo auto-catalytic processing. Instead, we provide evidence that the polyprotein is susceptible to proteolysis by host cell proteases and that this is essential for viral replication. Our data contradict the previous dogma of positive-sense viral replication and suggests a model where this virus has evolved to use a host protease to control viral replication and tropism.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drive is a phenomenon wherein a genetic element achieves a higher rate of transmission than dictated by Mendelian segregation (1-3). One proposed mechanism for meiotic drivers to achieve biased transmission is by sabotaging essential processes of gametogenesis (e.g. spermatogenesis), leading to demise of gametes that contain their opponents (1). Studies in D. simulans have recently found that a set of meiotic driver genes contain a sequence homologous to protamines (4, 5), critical proteins that package sperm chromatin (6-8). However, the underlying mechanisms of drive and the relevance of protamine-like sequences in meiotic drive remain unknown. While studying the function of Modulo, the homolog of Nucleolin in Drosophila melanogaster (9, 10), we unexpectedly discovered Y-linked protamine genes function as a meiotic driver: we found that modulo mutants known sterility is caused by deregulation of the autosomal protamine-like gene (Mst77F) and its Y chromosome-linked homolog (Mst77Y). Modulo regulates these genes at the step of polyadenylation of the transcripts. We show that Mst77Y likely acts as a dominant-negative form of Mst77F, interfering with the process of histone-to-protamine transition, leading to nuclear decompaction. Overexpression of Mst77Y in a wild-type background is sufficient to cause nuclear decompaction and results in the biased demise of X chromosome-bearing sperm. We propose that dominant-negative protamine variants may be a common strategy found in male meiotic drive and may explain known rapid divergence of protamine genes.\n\nSignificance statementProtamines are small, highly positively charged proteins that are required for packaging DNA to produce mature sperm with highly-condensed nuclei capable of fertilization. Even small changes in the dosage of protamines in humans is associated with infertility. Yet, despite their essential function, protamines are rapidly evolving. It has been speculated that protamines rapid divergence may be explained by their potential participation in genomic conflict. Our work implicates the involvement of Y chromosome-linked multicopy protamine-like genes in meiotic drive in Drosophila melanogaster. Our results suggest that dominant negative protamines can sabotage the process of nuclear compaction during spermiogenesis, revealing a potential cellular mechanism of sperm killing in meiotic drive.",

    "abstract": "Ants communicate via an arsenal of different pheromones produced in a variety of exocrine glands. For example, ants release alarm pheromones in response to danger to alert their nestmates and to trigger behavioral alarm responses. Here we characterize the alarm pheromone and the alarm response of the clonal raider ant Ooceraea biroi, a species that is amenable to laboratory studies but for which no pheromones have been identified. During an alarm response, ants quickly become unsettled, leave their nest pile, and are sometimes initially attracted to the source of alarm, but ultimately move away from it. We find that the alarm pheromone is released from the head of the ant and identify the putative alarm pheromone as a blend of two compounds found in the head, 4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol. These compounds are sufficient to induce alarm behavior alone and in combination. They elicit similar, though slightly different behavioral features of the alarm response, with 4-methyl-3-heptanone being immediately repulsive and 4-methyl-3-heptanol being initially attractive before causing ants to move away. The behavioral response to these compounds in combination is dose-dependent, with ants becoming unsettled and attracted to the source of alarm pheromone at low concentrations and repulsed at high concentrations. While 4-methyl-3-heptanone and 4-methyl-3-heptanol are known alarm pheromones in other more distantly related ant species, this is the first report of the chemical identity of a pheromone in O. biroi, and the first alarm pheromone identified in the genus Ooceraea. Identification of a pheromone that triggers a robust, consistent, and conserved behavior, like the alarm pheromone, provides an avenue to dissect the behavioral and neuronal mechanisms underpinning chemical communication.",

    "abstract": "The female germline of flowering plants develops within a niche of somatic ovule cells, also referred to as the nucellus. How niche cells maintain their own somatic developmental program, yet support the development of adjoining germline cells, remains largely unknown. Here we report that MADS31, a conserved MADS-box transcription factor from the B-sister subclass, is a potent regulator of niche cell identity in barley. MADS31 is preferentially expressed in nucellar cells directly adjoining the germline, and loss-of-function mads31 mutants exhibit deformed and disorganized nucellar cells, leading to impaired germline development and partial female sterility. Molecular assays indicate that MADS31 encodes a potent transcriptional repressor, repressing genes in the ovule that are normally active in the seed. One prominent target of MADS31 is NRPD4b, a seed-expressed component of RNA polymerase IV/V that is involved in gene silencing via RNA directed DNA methylation. NRPD4b is directly repressed by MADS31 in vivo and is de-repressed in mads31 ovules, while overexpression of NRPD4b recapitulates the mads31 ovule phenotype. This coincides with specific changes in histone methylation and is consistent with NRPD4b being directly repressed by MADS31 to maintain ovule niche functionality. Our findings reveal a new mechanism by which somatic ovule tissues maintain their own identity before transitioning to the post-fertilization program.",
