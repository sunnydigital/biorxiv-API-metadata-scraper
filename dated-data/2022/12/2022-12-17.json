    "abstract": "The learning of motor skills relies on plasticity of the primary motor cortex as task acquisition drives the remodeling of cortical motor networks1,2. Large scale cortical remodeling of evoked motor outputs occurs in response to the learning of skilled, corticospinal-dependent behavior, but not simple, unskilled tasks1. Here we determine the response of corticospinal neurons to both skilled and unskilled motor training and assess the role of corticospinal neuron activity in the execution of the trained behaviors. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we found temporal coding of corticospinal activity coincided with the development of skilled, but not unskilled, motor expertise. Animals that failed to learn our skilled, precision isometric pull task exhibited a limited repertoire of dynamic movements and reduced network modulation. Transection of the corticospinal tract and optogenetic regulation of corticospinal activity show the necessity for patterned corticospinal network activity in the execution of skilled, but not unskilled, movement. We reveal a critical role for corticospinal network modulation in the learning and execution of skilled motor movements. The integrity of the corticospinal tract is essential to the recovery of dexterous movement after central nervous system injuries and these findings should help to shape translational approaches to motor recovery.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor dynamics is fundamental to determine the activation of accurate transcriptional programs and yet is heterogeneous at single-cell level, even between very similar cells. We asked how such heterogeneity emerges for the nuclear factor{kappa} B (NF-{kappa}B), whose dynamics have been reported to cover a wide spectrum of behaviors, including persistent, oscillatory and weak activation. We found that clonal populations of immortalized fibroblasts derived from a single mouse embryo (that can hence be considered quasi-identical) display robustly distinct dynamics upon tumor necrosis [a] (TNF-[a]) stimulation, which give rise to differences in the transcription of NF-{kappa}B targets. Notably, standard transcriptomic analyses indicate that the clones differ mostly in transcriptional programs related with development, but not in TNF-[a] signaling. However, by combining transcriptomics data and simulations we show how the expression levels of genes coding for proteins of the signaling cascade determine the differences in early NF-{kappa}B activation; differences in the expression of I{kappa}B[a] determine differences in its persistence and oscillatory behavior. The same analysis predicts inter-clonal differences in the NF-{kappa}B response to IL-1{beta}. We propose that small (less than twofold) differences at transcript level are a source of heterogeneity in TF dynamics within homogeneous cell populations, and all the more so among different cell types.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=153 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471485v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1be3588org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@aca7e7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1434494org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14b67c3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms allow multicellular organisms to develop distinct specialized cell identities despite having the same total genome. Cell-fate choices are based on gene expression programs and environmental cues that cells experience during embryonic development, and are usually maintained throughout the life of the organism despite new environmental cues. The evolutionarily conserved Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form Polycomb Repressive Complexes that help orchestrate these developmental choices. Post-development, these complexes actively maintain the resulting cell fate, even in the face of environmental perturbations. Given the crucial role of these polycomb mechanisms in providing phenotypic fidelity (i.e. maintenance of cell fate), we hypothesize that their dysregulation after development will lead to decreased phenotypic fidelity allowing dysregulated cells to sustainably switch their phenotype in response to environmental changes. We call this abnormal phenotypic switching phenotypic pliancy. We introduce a general computational evolutionary model that allows us to test our systems-level phenotypic pliancy hypothesis in-silico and in a context-independent manner. We find that 1) phenotypic fidelity is an emergent systems-level property of PcG-like mechanism evolution, and 2) phenotypic pliancy is an emergent systems-level property resulting from this mechanisms dysregulation. Since there is evidence that metastatic cells behave in a phenotypically pliant manner, we hypothesize that progression to metastasis is driven by the emergence of phenotypic pliancy in cancer cells as a result of PcG mechanism dysregulation. We corroborate our hypothesis using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from metastatic cancers. We find that metastatic cancer cells are phenotypically pliant in the same manner as predicted by our model.\n\nSignificance StatementWe introduce the concept of cellular phenotypic pliancy- sustained abnormal phenotypic switching in response to environmental changes- and demonstrate that such behavior can be caused by dysregulation of Polycomb mechanisms. To overcome the incomplete knowledge about these mechanisms in higher organisms, we develop an abstract computational model to study the emergence of phenotypic pliancy from a general systems-level view by confirming our hypothesis over a wide range of simulated gene-regulatory networks and Polycomb mechanism patterns. We corroborate our hypothesis and model predictions using single-cell RNA-seq metastatic cancer datasets. Our hypothesis has the potential to shed light on a general phenomenon for complex diseases where abnormal phenotypic switching is relevant.",

    "abstract": "Ensemble representations have been considered as one of the strategies that the visual system adopts to cope with its limited capacity. Thus, they include various statistical summaries such as mean, variance, and distributional properties and are formed over many stages of visual processing. The current study proposes a population coding model of ensemble perception to provide a theoretical and computational framework for these various facets of ensemble perception. The proposed model consists of a simple feature layer and a pooling layer. We assumed ensemble representations as population responses in the pooling layer and decoded various statistical properties from population responses. Our model successfully predicted averaging performance in orientation, size, color, and motion direction across different tasks. Furthermore, it predicted variance discrimination performance and the priming effects of feature distributions. Finally, it explained the well-known variance and set size effects and has a potential for explaining the adaptation and clustering effects.",

    "abstract": "Identifying regulatory regions in the genome is of great interest for understanding the epigenomic landscape in cells. One fundamental challenge in this context is to find the target genes whose expression is affected by the regulatory regions. A recent successful method is the Activity-By-Contact (ABC) model (Fulco et al., 2019) which scores enhancer-gene interactions based on enhancer activity and the contact frequency of an enhancer to its target gene. However, it describes regulatory interactions entirely from a genes perspective, and does not account for all the candidate target genes of an enhancer. In addition, the ABC-model requires two types of assays to measure enhancer activity, which limits the applicability. Moreover, there is no implementation available that could allow for an integration with transcription factor (TF) binding information nor an efficient analysis of single-cell data. We demonstrate that the ABC-score can yield a higher accuracy by adapting the enhancer activity according to the number of contacts the enhancer has to its candidate target genes and also by considering all annotated transcription start sites of a gene. Further, we show that the model is comparably accurate with only one assay to measure enhancer activity. We combined our generalised ABC-model (gABC) with TF binding information and illustrate an analysis of a single-cell ATAC-seq data set of the human heart, where we were able to characterise cell type-specific regulatory interactions and predict gene expression based on transcription factor affinities. All executed processing steps are incorporated into our new computational pipeline STARE. The software is available at https://github.com/schulzlab/STARE.",

    "abstract": "Resting-state fMRI studies have revealed that individuals exhibit stable, functionally meaningful divergences in large-scale network organization. The locations with strongest deviations (called network  variants) have a characteristic spatial distribution, with qualitative evidence from prior reports suggesting that this distribution differs across hemispheres. Hemispheric asymmetries can inform us on constraints guiding the development of these idiosyncratic regions. Here, we used data from the Human Connectome Project to systematically investigate hemispheric differences in network variants. Variants were significantly larger in the right hemisphere, particularly along the frontal operculum and medial frontal cortex. Variants in the left hemisphere appeared most commonly around the temporoparietal junction. We investigated how variant asymmetries vary by functional network and how they compare with typical network distributions. For some networks, variants seemingly increase group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the group-average language network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere and variants also appeared more frequently in that hemisphere). For other networks, variants counter the group-average network asymmetries (e.g., the default mode network is slightly bigger in the left hemisphere, but variants were more frequent in the right hemisphere). Intriguingly, left- and right-handers differed in their network variant asymmetries for the cinguloopercular and frontoparietal networks, suggesting that variant asymmetries are connected to lateralized traits. These findings demonstrate that idiosyncratic aspects of brain organization differ systematically across the hemispheres. We discuss how these asymmetries in brain organization may inform us on developmental constraints of network variants, and how they may relate to functions differentially linked to the two hemispheres.",

Here we show that the EGR2-AS-RNA modulates chromatin accessibility and interacts with two distinct histone modification complexes. It binds to EZH2 and WDR5 and enables targeting of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 to promoters of EGR2and C-JUN respectively. Expression of the AS-RNA results in reorganization of the global chromatin landscape and quantitative changes in loop formation and in contact frequency at domain boundaries exhibiting enrichment for AP-1 genes. In addition, the EGR2-AS-RNA induces changes in hierarchical TADs and increases transcription factor occupancy on an inter-TAD loop between a super-enhancer regulatory hub and the promoter of mTOR. Our results show that the EGR2-AS-RNA may serve as regulator of chromatin remodeling and spatial genome organization in Schwann cells.",

Here, we infer the mixture of ways polygenic effects on physiological traits covary between males and females. We find that GxSex is pervasive but acts primarily through systematic sex differences in the magnitude of many genetic effects (\"amplification\"), rather than in the identity of causal variants. Amplification patterns account for sex differences in trait variance. In some cases, testosterone may mediate amplification. Finally, we develop a population-genetic test linking GxSex to contemporary natural selection and find evidence for sexually antagonistic selection on variants affecting testosterone levels. Taken together, our results suggest that the amplification of polygenic effects is a common mode of GxSex that may contribute to sex differences and fuel their evolution.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=130 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/490973v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c267eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a32233org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a6daeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@116cbff_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "We introduce dynamic predictive coding, a hierarchical model of spatiotemporal prediction and sequence learning in the cortex. The model assumes that higher cortical levels modulate the temporal dynamics of lower levels, correcting their predictions of dynamics using prediction errors. As a result, lower levels form representations that encode sequences at shorter timescales (e.g., a single step) while higher levels form representations that encode sequences at longer timescales (e.g., an entire sequence). We tested this model using a two-level neural network, where the top-down modulation is implemented as a low-dimensional mixture of possible temporal dynamics. When trained on natural videos, the lower-level model neurons developed space-time receptive fields similar to those of simple cells in the primary visual cortex while the higher-level responses spanned longer timescales, mimicking temporal response hierarchies in the cortex. Additionally, the networks hierarchical sequence representation exhibited both predictive and postdictive effects resembling those observed in visual motion processing in humans (e.g., the flash-lag illusion). When coupled with an associative memory mimicking the role of the hippocampus, the model allowed episodic memories to be stored and retrieved, supporting cue-triggered recall of an input sequence similar to activity recall in the visual cortex. Taken together, our results suggest that cortical processing and learning of sequences can be interpreted as dynamic predictive coding based on a hierarchical spatiotemporal generative model of the visual world.",

A recent theory developed for single movements proposes that motor cortex acts as a dynamical system whose initial state is optimized during the preparatory phase of the movement. This theory makes important yet untested predictions about preparatory dynamics in more complex behavioral settings. Here, we analyzed preparatory activity in non-human primates planning not one, but two movements simultaneously. As predicted by the theory, we found that parallel planning was achieved by adjusting preparatory activity within an optimal subspace to an intermediate state reflecting a tradeoff between the two movements. The theory quantitatively accounted for the relationship between this intermediate state and fluctuations in the animals behavior down at the trial level. These results uncover a simple mechanism for planning multiple movements in parallel, and further point to motor planning as a controlled dynamical process.",

    "abstract": "Aedes aegypti mosquitoes can transmit several arboviruses, including chikungunya virus (CHIKV), dengue virus (DENV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). When blood-feeding on a virus-infected human, the mosquito ingests the virus into the midgut (stomach), where it replicates and must overcome the midgut barrier to disseminate to other organs and ultimately be transmitted via the saliva. Current tools to study mosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) include 2D-cell culture systems and in vivo mosquito infection models, which offer great advantages, yet have some limitations.\n\nHere, we describe a long-term ex vivo culture of Ae. aegypti midguts. Cultured midguts were metabolically active for 7 days in a 96-well plate at 28{degrees}C and were permissive to ZIKV, DENV, Ross River virus (RRV) and CHIKV. Ex vivo midguts from Culex pipiens mosquitoes were found to be permissive to Usutu virus (USUV). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed viral protein synthesis in CHIKV-infected midguts of Ae. aegypti. Furthermore, fluorescence microscopy revealed replication and spread of a reporter DENV in specific regions of the midgut. In addition, two known antiviral molecules, {beta}-D-N4-hydroxycytidine (NHC) and 7-deaza-2-C-methyladenosine (7DMA), were able to inhibit CHIKV and ZIKV replication, respectively, in the ex vivo model.\n\nTogether, our results show that ex vivo midguts can be efficiently infected with mosquito-borne alpha- and flaviviruses and employed to evaluate antiviral drugs. Furthermore, the setup can be extended to other mosquito species. Ex vivo midgut cultures could thus be a new model to study MBVs, offering the advantage of reduced biosafety measures compared to infecting living mosquitoes.\n\nImportanceMosquito-borne viruses (MBVs) are a significant global health threat since they can cause severe diseases in humans, such as hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and chronic arthritis. MBVs rely on the mosquito vector to infect new hosts and perpetuate virus transmission. No therapeutics are currently available. The study of arbovirus infection in the mosquito vector can greatly contribute to elucidating strategies for controlling arbovirus transmission. This work investigated the infection of midguts from Aedes aegypti mosquitoes in an ex vivo platform. We found several MBVs capable of replicating in the midgut tissue, including viruses of major health importance, such as dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. Additionally, antiviral compounds reduced arbovirus infection in the cultured midgut tissue. Overall, the midgut model emerges as a useful tool for diverse applications such as studying tissue-specific responses to virus infection and screening potential anti-arboviral molecules.",

    "abstract": "Cellular fates are determined by genes interacting across large, complex biological networks. A critical question is how to identify causal relationships spanning distinct signaling pathways and underlying organismal phenotypes. Here, we address this question by constructing a Boolean model of a well-studied developmental network and analyzing information flows through the system. Depending on environmental signals Caenorhabditis elegans develop normally to sexual maturity or enter a reproductively delayed, developmentally quiescent  dauer state, progressing to maturity when the environment changes. The developmental network that starts with environmental signal and ends in the dauer/no dauer fate involves genes across 4 signaling pathways including cyclic GMP, Insulin/IGF-1, TGF-{beta} and steroid hormone synthesis. We identified three stable motifs leading to normal development, each composed of genes interacting across the Insulin/IGF-1, TGF-Beta and steroid hormone synthesis pathways. Three genes known to influence dauer fate, daf-2, daf-7 and hsf-1, acted as driver nodes in the system. Using causal logic analysis, we identified a five gene cyclic subgraph integrating the information flow from environmental signal to dauer fate. Perturbation analysis showed that a multifactorial insulin profile determined the stable motifs the system entered and interacted with daf-12 as the switchpoint driving the dauer/no dauer fate. Our results show that complex organismal systems can be distilled into abstract representations that permit full characterization of the causal relationships driving developmental fates. Analyzing organismal systems from this perspective of logic and function has important implications for studies examining the evolution and conservation of signaling pathways.",

Publicly released and annotated in 2017, the assembly has a scaffold N50 of 54 mb and is over 97.3% complete based on BUSCO analysis. The genome assembly for the eastern oyster is a critical resource for foundational research into molluscan adaptation to a changing environment and for selective breeding for the aquaculture industry. Subsequent resequencing data suggested the presence of haplotigs in the original assembly, and we developed a post hoc method to break up chimeric contigs and mask haplotigs in published heterozygous genomes and evaluated improvements to the accuracy of downstream analysis. Masking haplotigs had a large impact on SNP discovery and estimates of nucleotide diversity and had more subtle and nuanced effects on estimates of heterozygosity, population structure analysis, and outlier detection. We show that haplotig-masking can be a powerful tool for improving genomic inference, and we present an open, reproducible resource for the masking of haplotigs in any published genome.",

    "abstract": "In mediated interactions (e.g. video calls), less information is available about the other. To investigate how this affects our empathy for one another, we conducted an EEG study, in which thirty human participants observed one of 5 targets undergoing painful electric stimulation, once in a direct interaction and once in a live, video-mediated interaction. We found that observers were as accurate in judging others pain and showed as much affective empathy via video as in a direct encounter. While mu suppression, a common neural marker of empathy, was not sensitive to others pain, theta responses to others pain as well as skin conductance coupling between participants were reduced in the video-mediated condition. We conclude that physical proximity with its rich social cues is important for nuanced physiological resonance with the others experience. More studies are warranted to confirm these results and to understand their behavioural significance for remote social interactions.",

    "abstract": "Expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTLs), provide valuable information on the effects of genetic variants. Many methods have been developed to leverage eQTLs to nominate candidate genes of complex traits, including colocalization analysis, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and Mendelian Randomization (MR)-based methods. All these methods, however, suffer from a key problem: when using the eQTLs of a gene to assess its role in a trait, nearby variants and nearby genetic components of expression of other genes can be correlated with the eQTLs of the test gene, while affecting the trait directly. These \"genetic confounders\" often lead to false discoveries. We introduced a novel statistical framework to address this challenge. Our method, causal-TWAS (cTWAS), borrowed ideas from statistical fine-mapping, and allowed us to adjust all genetic confounders. In our simulations, we found that existing methods based on TWAS, colocalization or MR all suffered from high false positive rates, often greater than 50%. In contrast, cTWAS showed calibrated false positive rates while maintaining power. Application of cTWAS on several common traits highlighted the weakness of existing methods and discovered novel candidate genes. In conclusion, cTWAS is a novel statistical framework to integrate eQTL and GWAS data, enabling reliable gene discoveries.",

Here, we used root exudate stimulation on three Burkholderia and three Paraburkholderia strains isolated from rice roots to characterize their preliminary adaptation to the rice host at the transcriptomic level. Instead of the awaited genus-dependent adaptation, we observed a strongly species-specific response for all tested strains. While all bacteria originate from the rice environment, there are great disparities in their levels of adaptation following the sensing of root exudates. We further report the shared major functions that were differentially regulated in this early step of bacterial adaptation to plant colonization, including amino acids and putrescine metabolism, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway as well as cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) cycling.",

A previous parallel study comparing the transcriptomes of AA and ANE root-treated tomato demonstrated significant overlap in transcriptional profiles, a shared induced resistance phenotype, and changes in accumulation of various defense-related phytohormones. In this work, untargeted metabolomic analysis via liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was conducted to investigate the local and systemic metabolome-wide remodeling events elicited by AA- and ANE-root treatment in tomato. Our study demonstrated AA and ANEs capacity to locally and systemically alter the metabolome of tomato with enrichment of chemical classes and accumulation of metabolites associated with defense-related secondary metabolism. AA and ANE root-treated plants showed enrichment of fatty acyl-glycosides and strong modulation of hydroxycinnamic acids and derivatives. Identification of specific metabolites whose accumulation was affected by AA and ANE treatment revealed shared metabolic changes related to ligno-suberin biosynthesis and the synthesis of phenolic compounds. This study highlights the extensive local and systemic metabolic changes in tomato induced by treatment with a fatty acid MAMP and a seaweed-derived plant biostimulant with implications for induced resistance and crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe microbial communities of disease vectors may represent a key feature in several biological functions and thus deserve special attention in light of climate change and the consequent need to develop novel control strategies. Nevertheless, vector-borne microbial networks are still poorly understood. Assessing vectors microbial interactions and climatic dependencies may contribute to better-estimating pathogen transmission characteristics, public health risks and the urgency for control steps to be taken.\n\nMethodsIn a climatically representative country-wide survey, Ixodes ricinus ticks were collected from 17 locations in Hungary. Using shotgun metagenomic sequencing, the bacteriome composition was analyzed by investigating the relationship between the abundances of nymphs and females in various climatic environments.\n\nResultsBacterial composition on the genus level revealed a significant difference between the samples from females and nymphs. Within the core bacteriome, females and nymphs showed significant variation in the following genera: Arsenophonus, Bacillus, Candidatus Midichloria, Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas, Staphylococcus, Wolbachia. Among females, according to temperature strata, the following were found differentiating: Curtobacterium, Pseudomonas, Sphingomonas. There was no genus with a significant difference in precipitation categories for females. In the nymphs, Curtobacterium showed significant variation between temperature and Bacillus and Curtobacterium for various precipitation levels. Based on the full sample set, Arsenophonus and Wolbachia correlated positively which we assumed to have occurred due to the presence of I. hookeri.\n\nConclusionsThe composition of vector-borne bacteriome members showed significant alterations at sampling points with different climatic conditions and development stages of the tick hosts. Our findings not only pave the way towards understanding tick-borne bacterial networks and interdependencies but also shed light on the high potential for the presence of a possible biological tick control species, the tick parasitoid, Ixodiphagus hookeri based on related bacteriome patterns. The results of conscious tick microbiome assessment studies may contribute to precision tick control strategies of the future.",

    "abstract": "During locomotion, soft-bodied terrestrial animals solve complex control problems at substrate interfaces, but our understanding of how they achieve this without rigid components remains incomplete. Here, we develop new all-optical methods based on optical interference in a deformable substrate to measure ground reaction forces (GRFs) with micrometre and nanonewton precision in behaving Drosophila larvae. Combining this with a kinematic analysis of substrate interfacing features, we shed new light onto the biomechanical control of larval locomotion. Crawling in larvae measuring [~]1 mm in length involves an intricate pattern of cuticle sequestration and planting, producing GRFs of 1-7 N. We show that larvae insert and expand denticulated, feet-like structures into substrates as they move, a process not previously observed in soft bodied animals. These  protopodia form dynamic anchors to compensate counteracting forces. Our work provides a framework for future biomechanics research in soft-bodied animals and promises to inspire improved soft-robot design.",

    "abstract": "Our actions and choices sometimes seem driven by our \"needs\", sometimes by our \"wants\", and sometimes by both. Needing is related to deprivation of something biologically significant, and wanting is linked to reward prediction and dopamine and usually has more power on behavioral activation than need states alone. Why sometimes there is an association and sometimes a dissociation between needing and wanting remains largely unknown. This paper aims to clarify the relations between needing and wanting, from the perspective of a normative framework to understand brain and cognition; namely, active inference. In this approach, needing is related to a deviation from preferred states that living things tend to occupy in order to reduce their surprise, while wanting is related to the precision over policies that lead to preferred (e.g., rewarding) states. Also, we hypothesized that needing exerts a pervasive effect that is embodied on the organism. Through a series of simulations, we demonstrate the interplay between needing and wanting systems. Specifically, our simulations show that when need states increase, the tendency to occupy preferred states is enhanced, independently of wanting (or reward prediction), therefore showing a dissociation between needing and wanting. Furthermore, the simulations show that when need states increase, the value of cues that signal reward achievement and the precision of the policies that lead to preferred states increase, suggesting that needs can amplify the value of a reward and its wanting. Taken together, our model and simulations help clarify the directional and underlying influence of need states separately from wanting and reward prediction; and how the same underlying influence of need amplifies wanting, i.e. increases the precision of available reward cues that lead to the preferred state.",

However, there is a lack of evidence for cooperation and kin selection in natural bacterial populations. Molecular population genetics offers a promising method to study natural populations, because theory predicts that kin selection will lead to relaxed selection, which will result in increased polymorphism and divergence at cooperative genes. Examining a natural population of Bacillus subtilis, we found consistent evidence that putatively cooperative traits have higher polymorphism and greater divergence than putatively private traits expressed at the same rate. In addition, we were able to eliminate alternative explanations for these patterns, and found more deleterious mutations in genes controlling putatively cooperative traits. Overall, our results suggest cooperation favoured by kin selection, with an average relatedness of r=0.77 between interacting individuals.",

    "abstract": "The capacity for autonomous behaviour is key to human intelligence, and fundamental to modern social life. However, experimental investigations of the cognitive bases of human autonomy are challenging, because experimental paradigms typically constrain behaviour using controlled contexts, and elicit behaviour by external triggers. In contrast, autonomy and freedom imply unconstrained behaviour initiated by endogenous triggers. Here we propose a new theoretical construct of adaptive autonomy, meaning the capacity to make behavioural choices that are free from constraints of both immediate external triggers and of routine response patterns, but nevertheless show appropriate coordination with the environment. Participants (N = 152) played a competitive game in which they had to choose the right time to act, in the face of an opponent who punished (in separate blocks) either choice biases (such as always responding early), sequential patterns of action timing across trials (such as early, late, early, late...), or predictable action-outcome dependence (such as win-stay, lose-shift). Adaptive autonomy was quantified as the ability to maintain performance when each of these influences on action selection was punished. We found that participants could become free from habitual choices regarding when to act and could also become free from sequential action patterns. However, they were not able to free themselves from influences of action-outcome dependence, even when these resulted in poor performance. These results point to a new concept of autonomous behaviour as flexible adaptation of voluntary action choice under different classes of internal constraint.",

They play a central role in generating an effective immune response against infectious pathogens, and failures in their regulating mechanisms can lead to the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer. While previous works study experimental systems of the immune response with mouse models that are immunized with specific antigens, our study focuses on a real life situation, with an ongoing GC response in a human lymph node (LN) involving multiple asynchronized GCs reacting simultaneously to unknown antigens. We combined laser capture microdissection (LCM) of individual GCs from human LN with next-generation repertoire sequencing (Rep-seq) to characterize individual GCs as distinct evolutionary spaces. In line with well-characterized GC responses in mice, elicited by immunization with model antigens such as NP-CGG, we observe a relatively low sequence similarity, as well as heterogeneous clonal diversity across individual GCs from the same human LN. Still, we identify shared clones in several individual GCs, and phylogenetic tree analysis combined with paratope modeling suggest the re-engagement and rediversification of B-cell clones across GCs as well as expanded clones exhibiting shared antigen responses across distinct GCs, indicating convergent evolution of the GCs. Finally, our study allows for the characterization of non-functional clones, where frequencies of V(D)J or SHM induced stop codons are quantified.",

Here, we propose that the auditory system can achieve this goal by using time as a supervisor, i.e., by learning features of a stimulus that are temporally regular. We will show that this procedure generates a feature space sufficient to support fundamental computations of auditory perception. In detail, we consider the problem of discriminating between instances of a prototypical class of natural auditory objects, i.e., rhesus macaque vocalizations. We test discrimination in two ethologically relevant tasks: discrimination in a cluttered acoustic background and generalization to discriminate between novel exemplars. We show that an algorithm that learns these temporally regular features affords better or equivalent discrimination and generalization than conventional feature-selection algorithms, i.e., principal component analysis and independent component analysis. Our findings suggest that the slow temporal features of auditory stimuli may be sufficient for parsing auditory scenes and that the auditory brain could utilize these slowly changing temporal features.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between structural and functional connectivity in the human brain is a core question in network neuroscience, and a topic of paramount importance to our ability to meaningfully describe and predict functional outcomes. Graph theory has been used to produce measures based on the structural connectivity network that are related to functional connectivity. These measures are commonly based on either the shortest path routing model or the diffusion model, which carry distinct assumptions about how information is transferred through the network. Unlike shortest path routing, which assumes the most efficient path is always known, the diffusion model makes no such assumption, and lets information diffuse in parallel based on the number of connections to other regions. Past research has also developed hybrid measures that use concepts from both models, which have better predicted the functional connectivity from structural connectivity than shortest path length alone. We examined the extent to which each of these models can account for the structure-function relationship of interest using graph theory measures that are exclusively based on each model. This analysis was performed on multiple parcellations of the Human Connectome Project using multiple approaches, which all converged on the same finding. We found that the diffusion model accounts for much more variance in functional connectivity than the shortest path routing model, suggesting that the diffusion model is better suited to describing the structure-function relationship in the human brain at the macroscale.",

    "abstract": "Crowding occurs when the presence of nearby features causes highly visible objects to become unrecognizable. Although crowding has implications for many everyday tasks and the tremendous amounts of research reflect its importance, surprisingly little is known about how depth affects crowding. Most available studies show that stereoscopic disparity reduces crowding, indicating that crowding may be relatively unimportant in three-dimensional environments. However, most previous studies tested only small stereoscopic differences in depth in which disparity, defocus blur, and accommodation are inconsistent with the real world. Using a novel multi-depth plane display, this study investigated how large (0.54 - 2.25 diopters), real differences in target-flanker depth, representative of those experienced between many objects in the real world, affect crowding. Our findings show that large differences in target-flanker depth increased crowding in the majority of observers, contrary to previous work showing reduced crowding in the presence of small depth differences. Furthermore, when the target was at fixation depth, crowding was generally more pronounced when the flankers were behind the target as opposed to in front of it. However, when the flankers were at fixation depth, crowding was generally more pronounced when the target was behind the flankers. These findings suggest that crowding from clutter outside the limits of binocular fusion can still have a significant impact on object recognition and visual perception in the peripheral field.",

    "abstract": "We investigated memory encoding and retrieval during a quasi-naturalistic spatial-episodic memory task in which subjects delivered items to landmarks in a virtual environment and later recalled the delivered items. Recall transitions revealed spatial and temporal organization of studied items. Using scalp electroencephalography (EEG), we asked whether neural signatures of successful encoding and retrieval uncovered in traditional word list tasks also appear when learning occurs within a spatiotemporal context. We found that increased theta (T +) and decreased alpha/beta (A-) accompanied successful encoding events, with the addition of increased gamma (G+) for retrieval events. Logistic-regression classifiers trained on these spectral features reliably predicted encoding and retrieval success in hold-out sessions. Both univariate and multivariate analyses of EEG data revealed a similar spectral T +A-G+ of successful encoding and retrieval. These findings extend behavioral and neural signatures of recall to naturalistic and multidimensional encoding conditions.",

Thus, problems with the import machinery will disrupt their regenerative capacity and the cells energy (ATP) supplies-particularly troublesome for energy demanding cells like neurons and myocytes. Unsurprisingly then, dysfunctional import is implicated in disease. This study explores the consequences of import failure in mammalian cells; wherein, blocking the import machinery has profound effects on mitochondrial ultra-structure and dynamics, but, surprisingly, does not impact import. The explanation is an astonishing response involving intercellular mitochondrial transfer via tunnelling nanotubes: for the import of healthy mitochondria and jettisoning of those with jammed import sites. These observations support the existence of a widespread mechanism for the rescue of mitochondrial protein import failure.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA mitochondrial import rescue mechanism involving intercellular mitochondrial transport through tunneling nanotubes (TNTs).",

How these capillary types emerge in a brain region-specific manner and subsequently establish intrabrain vascular heterogeneity remains unclear. Here, we show a core angiogenic mechanism critical for fenestrated brain capillary development via a comparative analysis of the zebrafish choroid plexuses (CPs) and circumventricular organs (CVOs), demonstrating capillary-type-selective vascularization mechanisms. We found that zebrafish deficient for Gpr124, Reck, or Wnt7aa exhibit severely-impaired BBB angiogenesis without any apparent defect in fenestrated capillary formation in the CPs and CVOs. Conversely, simultaneous genetic loss of various Vegf combinations revealed remarkable heterogeneity of endothelial requirements for Vegfs-dependent angiogenesis within and across these organs, identifying unexpected interplay of Vegfc/d and Vegfa in fenestrated brain capillary formation. Expression analysis and paracrine activity-deficient vegfc mutant characterization suggest that endothelial cells and non-neuronal specialized cell types present in the CPs and CVOs are major sources of Vegfs responsible for regionally-restricted angiogenic interplay. Thus, local presentations and interplay of Vegfc/d and Vegfa control brain region-specific emergence of fenestrated capillaries, providing insight into fenestrated capillary formation in other organs and also how intra-organ vascular heterogeneity arises.",

    "abstract": "Sap-feeding hemipteran insects live in associations with diverse heritable endosymbiotic bacteria and fungi that provide essential nutrients deficient in their diets. These symbionts typically reside in bacteriomes, dedicated organs made up of specialized cells termed bacteriocytes. The bacteriome organization varies between insect clades that are ancestrally associated with different microbes. As these symbioses evolve and additional microorganisms complement or replace the ancient associates, the organization of the symbiont-containing tissue becomes even more variable.\n\nPlanthoppers (Hemiptera: Fulgoromorpha) are ancestrally associated with bacterial symbionts Sulcia and Vidania, but in many of the planthopper lineages, these symbionts are now accompanied or have been replaced by other heritable bacteria (e.g., Sodalis, Arsenophonus, Purcelliella) or fungi. We know the identity of many of these microbes, but the symbiont distribution within the host tissues and the bacteriome organization have not been systematically studied using modern microscopy techniques.\n\nHere, we combine light, fluorescence, and transmission electron microscopy with phylogenomic data to compare symbiont tissue distributions and the bacteriome organization across planthoppers representing 15 families. We identify and describe seven primary types of symbiont localization and seven types of the organization of the bacteriome. We show that Sulcia and Vidania, when present, occupy distinct bacteriomes distributed within the body cavity. The more recently acquired gammaproteobacterial and fungal symbionts generally occupy separate groups of cells organized into distinct bacteriomes or mycetomes, distinct from those with Sulcia and Vidania. They can also be localized in the cytoplasm of fat body cells. Alphaproteobacterial symbionts colonize a wider range of host body habitats: Asaia-like symbionts often colonize the host gut lumen, whereas Wolbachia and Rickettsia are usually scattered across tissues and cell types, including bacteriocytes containing other symbionts, bacteriome sheath, fat body cells, gut epithelium, as well as hemolymph. However, there are exceptions, including Gammaproteobacteria that share bacteriome with Vidania, or Alphaproteobacteria that colonize Sulcia cells.\n\nWe discuss how planthopper symbiont localization correlates with their acquisition and replacement patterns and the symbionts likely functions. We also discuss the evolutionary consequences, constraints, and significance of these findings.",

However, many nocturnal birds have evolved intensely white plumage patches within otherwise inconspicuous plumages. We used spectrophotometry, electron microscopy, and optical modelling to explain the mechanisms producing bright white tail feather tips of the Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola. Their diffuse reflectance was [~]30% higher than any previously measured feather. This intense reflectance is the result of incoherent light scattering from a disordered nanostructure composed of keratin and air within the barb rami. In addition, the flattening, thickening, and arrangement of those barbs creates a Venetian-blind-like macrostructure that enhances the surface area for light reflection. We suggest that the woodcocks have evolved these bright white feather patches for long-range visual communication in dimly lit environments.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic transitions in related taxa often share a common genetic basis, which suggests that there are constraints that shape the process of evolution at the genetic level. For example, noncoding changes in a gene might be favored relative to coding changes due to being less constrained by pleiotropic effects. Here we evaluate the importance of coding-sequence changes to the recent evolution of a novel anthocyanin pigmentation trait in the monkeyflower genus Mimulus. The magenta-flowered Mimulus luteus var. variegatus recently gained petal lobe anthocyanin pigmentation via a single-locus Mendelian difference from its sister taxon, the yellow-flowered M. l. luteus. Previous work showed that the differentially expressed transcription factor gene MYB5a/NEGAN is the single causal gene. However, it was not clear whether MYB5a coding-sequence evolution (in addition to the observed patterns of differential expression) might also have contributed to increased anthocyanin production in M. l. variegatus. Quantitative image analysis of tobacco leaves, transfected with highly expressed MYB5a coding sequence from each taxon, revealed robust anthocyanin production driven by both alleles compared to a negative control. Counter to expectations, significantly higher anthocyanin production was driven by the coding sequence from the low-anthocyanin taxon M. l. luteus. Together with previously-published expression studies, this supports the hypothesis that petal pigment in M. l. variegatus was not gained by protein-coding changes, but instead via non- coding cis-regulatory evolution. Finally, while constructing the transgenes needed for this experiment, we unexpectedly discovered two sites in MYB5a that appear to be post- transcriptionally edited - a phenomenon that has been rarely reported, and even less often explored, for nuclear-encoded plant mRNAs.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWGenerative models for protein sequences are important for protein design, mutational effect prediction and structure prediction. In all of these tasks, the introduction of models which include interactions between pairs of positions has had a major impact over the last decade. More recently, many methods going beyond pairwise models have been developed, for example by using neural networks that are in principle able to capture interactions between more than two positions from multiple sequence alignments. However, not much is known about the inter-dependency patterns between positions in these models, and how important higher-order interactions involving more than two positions are for their performance. In this work, we introduce the notion of mean dimension for generative models for protein sequences, which measures the average number of positions involved in interactions when weighted by their contribution to the total variance in log probability of the model. We estimate the mean dimension for different model classes trained on different protein families, relate it to the performance of the models on mutational effect prediction tasks and also trace its evolution during training. The mean dimension is related to the performance of models in biological prediction tasks and can highlight differences between model classes even if their performance in the prediction task is similar. The overall low mean dimension indicates that well-performing models are not necessarily of high complexity and encourages further work in interpreting their performance in biological terms.",

    "abstract": "Hybridization is a natural process whereby two diverging evolutionary lineages reproduce and create offspring of mixed ancestry. Differences in mating systems (e.g., self-fertilization and outcrossing) are expected to affect the direction and extent of hybridization and introgression in hybrid zones. Among other factors, selfers and outcrossers are expected to differ in their mutation loads. This has been studied both theoretically and empirically; however, conflicting predictions have been made on the effects mutation loads of parental species with different mating systems can have on the genomic composition of hybrids. Here we develop a multi-locus, selective model to study how the different mutation load built up in selfers and outcrossers as a result of selective interference and homozygosity impact the long-term genetic composition of hybrid populations. Notably, our results emphasize that genes from the parental population with lesser mutation load get rapidly over-represented in hybrid genomes, regardless of the hybrids own mating system. When recombination tends to be more important than mutation, outcrossers genomes tend to be of higher quality and prevail. When recombination is small, however, selfers genomes may reach higher quality than outcrossers genomes and prevail. Taken together these results provide concrete insights into one of the multiple factors influencing hybrid genome composition and introgression patterns in hybrid zones with species containing species with different mating systems.",

When surgery is not possible, therapeutic options are few and ineffective2. Patients are most often treated with Folfirinox or gemcitabine chemotherapy, that extends survival in weeks to months. Cytidine deaminase (CDA) catalyzes the irreversible hydrolytic deamination of cytidine and deoxycytidine to uridine and deoxyuridine to fuel RNA and DNA synthesis3. CDA also deaminates and neutralizes deoxycytidine-based therapies, and as such, has been identified as a major contributor of tumor chemoresistance, especially to gemcitabine in PDAC3. We previously identified that CDA is elevated in PDAC tumors at diagnosis and that CDA exerts an unexpected role on DNA replication that can be exploited for therapeutic intervention4. Very recently, CDA was associated with cellular metabolism5. Here, we show that CDA promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation independently of its deaminase activity. This uncloaks novel therapeutic vulnerabilities in primary cancer cells that overexpress this protein. This study shines a new light on the tumoral potential of CDA in PDAC.",

    "abstract": "Temporal interference stimulation (TIS) is a new form of transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) that has been proposed as a method for targeted, non-invasive stimulation of deep brain structures. While TIS holds promise for a variety of clinical and non-clinical applications, little data is yet available regarding its effects in humans. To inform the design and approval of experiments involving TIS, researchers require quantitative guidance regarding exposure limits and other safety concerns. To this end, we sought to delineate a safe range of exposure parameters (voltages and currents applied via external scalp electrodes) for TIS in humans through comparisons with well-established but related brain stimulation modalities. Specifically, we surveyed the literature for adverse events (AEs) associated with transcranial alternating/direct current stimulation (tACS/tDCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and TIS to establish known boundaries for safe operating conditions. Drawing on the biophysical mechanisms associated with the identified AEs, we determined appropriate exposure metrics for each stimulation modality. Using these metrics, we conducted an in silico comparison of various exposure scenarios for tACS, DBS, and TIS using multiphysics simulations in an anatomically detailed head model with realistic current strengths. By matching stimulation scenarios in terms of biophysical impact, we inferred the frequency-dependent TIS stimulation parameters that resulted in exposure magnitudes known to be safe for tACS and DBS. Based on the results of our simulations and existing knowledge regarding tES and DBS safety, we propose frequency-dependent thresholds below which TIS voltages and currents are unlikely to pose a risk to humans. Safety-related data from ongoing and future human studies are required to verify and refine the thresholds proposed here.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulated inflammation within the central nervous system (CNS) contributes to neuropathology in infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative disease. With the exception of microglia, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins are virtually undetectable in the mature, healthy central nervous system (CNS). Neurons have generally been considered incapable of antigen presentation, and although interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) can elicit neuronal MHC class I (MHC-I) expression and antigen presentation in vitro, it remains unclear whether similar responses occur in vivo. Here we directly injected IFN-{gamma} into the ventral midbrain of mature mice and analyzed gene expression profiles of specific CNS cell types. We find that IFN-{gamma} induces cellular proliferation and expression of MHC-II and associated genes only in microglia. However, IFN-{gamma} upregulated MHC-I and associated mRNAs in ventral midbrain microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and GABAergic, glutamatergic, and dopaminergic neurons. The core set of IFN-{gamma}-induced genes and their response kinetics were conserved across neurons and glia, with a lower amplitude of expression in neurons. A diverse repertoire of genes was upregulated in glia, particularly microglia, while no neuron-specific responses to IFN-{gamma} were observed. Using mutant mice to selectively delete the IFN-{gamma}-binding domain of IFNGR1 in dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that dopaminergic neurons respond directly to IFN-{gamma}. Our results suggest that most neurons are capable of responding directly to IFN-{gamma} and upregulating MHC-I and related genes in vivo, but their expression amplitude and repertoire is limited compared to oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia.\n\nOne-sentence summaryWe find that IFN-{gamma} induces transcription of MHC class I antigen processing and presentation machinery in all major parenchymal cell types in the ventral midbrain; however, neuronal responses are low amplitude and limited to a small set of genes, MHC class II expression and cellular proliferation are restricted to microglia, and dopamine neuronal responses require cell autonomous expression of IFNGR1.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factor (TF) proteins regulate gene expression by binding to specific sites on the genome. In the facilitated diffusion model, an optimized search process is achieved by the TF protein alternating between 3D diffusion in the bulk and 1D diffusion along DNA. While undergoing 1D diffusion, the protein can switch from a search mode for fast diffusion along non-specific DNA to a recognition mode for stable binding to specific DNA. It was recently noticed that for a small TF domain protein, re-orientations on DNA other than conformational changes happen between the non-specific and specific DNA binding. We here conducted all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with steering forces to reveal the protein-DNA binding free energetics, with a difference between the non-specific and specific binding about 10 kBT, confirming that the search and recognition modes are distinguished only by protein orientations on the DNA. As the binding free energy difference differs from that being estimated from experimental measurements about 4-5 kBT on 15-bp DNA constructs, we hypothesize that the discrepancy comes from DNA sequences flanking the 6-bp central binding sites impacting on the dissociation kinetics measurements. The hypothesis is supported by a simplified spherical protein-DNA model along with stochastic simulations and kinetic modeling.",

    "abstract": "Exposure to drugs of abuse causes long-lasting changes in connectivity to ventral tegmental area dopamine cells that contribute to drug-induced behavioral adaptations. However, it is not known which inputs are altered, largely due to technological limitations of previous methods. Here we used a rabies virus-based mapping strategy to quantify rabies-labeled inputs to ventral tegmental area cells after a single exposure to one of a variety of abused drugs - cocaine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, morphine, and nicotine - and compared the relative global input labeling across conditions using dimensionality reduction approaches. We observed that all tested drugs of abuse elicited input changes onto dopamine cells, in particular those projecting to the lateral shell of the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, and that these changes were common to all drugs tested. Interestingly, we also noticed that animals anesthetized with a ketamine/xylazine mixture exhibit a different brain-wide input pattern from those anesthetized with isoflurane, indicating that the method of anesthesia can influence rabies input labeling by inducing long-lasting changes in circuit connectivity. In addition, many input changes were common between animals anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine and those anesthetized with isoflurane but also given a single dose of a drug of abuse, suggesting that the ketamine/xylazine mixture can induce these long-lasting input changes. We found that many of the brain regions that exhibited changes in rabies input labeling in drug- vs. saline-treated mice were preferentially interconnected, and that select communities of brain regions showed similar changes for both drugs of abuse and ketamine/xylazine anesthesia. Lastly, the basal expression patterns of several gene classes were highly correlated with the extent of both addictive drug- or ketamine/xylazine-induced input changes, especially calcium channels. These results indicate that the expression of calcium channels is related to whether these inputs to dopamine cells are altered by drug exposure. Furthermore, ketamine/xylazine anesthesia induces a similar but different set of long-lasting input changes onto midbrain dopamine cells, indicating that caution should be taken when using ketamine/xylazine-based anesthesia in rodents when assessing motivated behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major psychiatric complication of childbirth, affecting up to 20% of mothers, yet remains understudied. Mitochondria, dynamic organelles crucial for cell homeostasis and energy production, share links with many of the proposed mechanisms underlying PPD pathology. Brain mitochondrial function is affected by stress, a major risk factor for development of PPD, and is linked to anxiety-like and social behaviors. Considering the importance of mitochondria in regulating brain function and behavior, we hypothesized that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with behavioral alterations in a chronic stress-induced rat model of PPD. Using a validated and translationally relevant chronic mild unpredictable stress paradigm during late gestation, we induced PPD-relevant behaviors in adult postpartum Wistar rats. In the mid-postpartum, we measured mitochondrial function in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) using high-resolution respirometry. We then measured protein expression of mitochondrial complex proteins and 4-hydroxynonenal (a marker of oxidative stress), and Th1/Th2 cytokine levels in PFC and plasma. We report novel findings that gestational stress decreased mitochondrial function in the PFC, but not the NAc of postpartum dams. However, in groups controlling for the effects of either stress or parity alone, no differences in mitochondrial respiration measured in either brain regions were observed compared to nulliparous controls. This decrease in PFC mitochondrial function in stressed dams was accompanied by negative behavioral consequences in the postpartum, complex-I specific deficits in protein expression, and increased Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha cytokine levels in plasma and PFC. Overall, we report an association between PFC mitochondrial respiration, PPD-relevant behaviors, and inflammation following gestational stress, highlighting a potential role for mitochondrial function in postpartum health.",

But our understanding of the temporal and spatial dynamics of these events are hindered by slow volumetric imaging rates and the reliance on laborious manual analysis to process data. To address the challenges of increasing volumetric imaging speed, we use a custom-built Bessel beam two-photon microscope for efficient volumetric imaging of the capillary network. We demonstrate its ability to continuously monitor roughly 200 capillaries for capillary flow stoppages (i.e. stalling events) at a frame rate of approximately 0.5 Hz and develop a semi-automated correlation-based approach for identifying these stalling events. We applied our system and algorithm in a photothrombotic model of stroke and show elevated levels of stalling 1-week post-stroke in regions both within and outside of the stroke region, demonstrating that stalling may have impacts on stroke recovery that extend past the acute stage.",

    "abstract": "Satisfying a variety of conflicting needs in a changing environment is a fundamental challenge for any adaptive agent. Here, we show that designing an agent in a modular fashion as a collection of subagents, each dedicated to a separate need, powerfully enhanced the agents capacity to satisfy its overall needs. We used the formalism of deep reinforcement learning to investigate a biologically relevant multi-objective task: continually maintaining homeostasis of a set of physiologic variables. We then conducted simulations in a variety of environments and compared how modular agents performed relative to standard monolithic agents (i.e., agents that aimed to satisfy all needs in an integrated manner using a single aggregate measure of success). Simulations revealed that modular agents: a) exhibited a form of exploration that was intrinsic and emergent rather than extrinsically imposed; b) were robust to changes in non-stationary environments, and c) scaled gracefully in their ability to maintain home-ostasis as the number of conflicting objectives increased. Supporting analysis suggested that the robustness to changing environments and increasing numbers of needs were due to intrinsic exploration and efficiency of representation afforded by the modular architecture. These results suggest that the normative principles by which agents have adapted to complex changing environments may also explain why humans have long been described as consisting of  multiple selves.\n\nSignificance StatementAdaptive agents must continually satisfy a range of distinct and possibly conflicting needs. In most models of learning, a monolithic agent tries to maximize one value that measures how well it balances its needs. However, this task is difficult when the world is changing and needs are many. Here, we considered an agent as a collection of modules each dedicated to a particular need and competing for control of action. Compared to the standard monolithic approach, modular agents were much better at maintaining homeostasis of a set of internal variables in simulated environments, both static and changing. These results suggest that having  multiple selves may represent an evolved solution to the universal problem of balancing multiple needs in changing environments.",

    "abstract": "The differential sensitivity hypothesis argues that environmental sensitivity has the bivalent effect of predisposing individuals to both the risk-inducing and development-enhancing influences of early social environments. However, the hypothesis requires that this variation in environmental sensitivity be general across domains. In this study, we focused on neural sensitivity and autonomic arousal to test domain generality. Neural sensitivity can be assessed by correlating measures of perceptual sensitivity, as indexed by event-related potentials (ERP) in electrophysiology. The sensitivity of autonomic arousal can be tested via heart rate changes. Domain generality was tested by comparing associations in perceptual sensitivity across auditory and visual domains, and associations between sensitivity in sensory domains and heart rate We contrasted ERP components in auditory (P3) and visual (P1, N290 and P4) detection-of-difference tasks for N=68 infants longitudinally at 6 and 12 months of age. Domain generality should produce correlated individual differences in sensitivity across the two modalities, with higher levels of autonomic arousal associating with increased perceptual sensitivity. Having controlled for multiple comparisons, at 6 months of age, the difference in amplitude of the P3 component evoked in response to standard and deviant tones correlated with the difference in amplitude of the P1 N290 and P4 face-sensitive components evoked in response to fearful and neutral faces. However, this correlation was not found at 12 months of age. Similarly, autonomic arousal negatively correlated with neural sensitivity at 6 months but not at 12 months. The results suggest neural perceptual sensitivity is domain-general across auditory and visual domains, and is related to autonomic arousal at 6 months but not at 12 months of age. We interpret these findings within a neuroconstructivist framework and with respect to the concept of interactive specialisation. By 12 months of age, more experience of visual processing may have led to top-down endogenous attention mechanisms that process visual information in a way that no longer associates with auditory perceptual sensitivity.",

    "abstract": "The multicellular inflammatory encapsulation of implanted intracortical multielectrode arrays (MEA) is associated with severe deterioration of their field potentials (FP) recording performance, which thus limits the use of brain implants in basic research and clinical applications. Therefore, extensive efforts have been made to identify the conditions in which the inflammatory foreign body response (FBR) is alleviated, or to develop methods to mitigate the formation of the inflammatory barrier. Here, for the first time, we show that (1) in young rats (74{+/-}8 gr, 4 weeks old at the onset of the experiments), cortical tissue recovery following MEA implantation proceeds with ameliorated inflammatory scar as compared to adult rats (242 {+/-}18 gr, 9 weeks old at the experimental onset); (2) in contrast to adult rats in which the Colony Stimulating factor 1 Receptor (CSF1R) antagonist chow eliminated ~95% of the cortical microglia but not microglia adhering to the implant surfaces, in young rats the microglia adhering to the implant were eliminated along with the parenchymal microglia population. The removal of microglia adhering to the implant surfaces was correlated with improved recording performance by in-house fabricated Perforated Polyimide MEA Platforms (PPMP). These results support the hypothesis that microglia adhering to the surface of the electrodes, rather than the multicellular inflammatory scar, is the major underlying mechanism that deteriorates implant recording performance, and that young rats provide an advantageous model to study months-long, multisite electrophysiology in freely behaving rats.",

    "abstract": "Investigation of rodent drinking behavior has provided insight into drivers of thirst, circadian rhythms, anhedonia, and drug and ethanol consumption. Traditional methods of recording fluid intake involve weighing bottles, which is cumbersome and lacks temporal resolution. Several open-source devices have been designed to improve drink monitoring, particularly for two-bottle choice tasks. However, recent designs are limited by the use of infrared photobeam sensors and incompatibility with prolonged undisturbed use in ventilated home cages. Beam-break sensors lack accuracy for bout microstructure analysis and are prone to damage from rodents. Thus, we designed LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home cage Device) with the goal of utilizing capacitive sensors to increase accuracy and analyze lick microstructure, building a device compatible with ventilated home cages, increasing scale with prolonged undisturbed recordings, and creating a design that is easy to build and use with an intuitive touchscreen graphical user interface. The system tracks two-bottle choice licking behavior in up to 18 rodent cages, or 36 single bottles, on a minute-to-minute timescale controlled by a single Arduino microcontroller. The data are logged to a single SD card, allowing for efficient downstream analysis. With sucrose, quinine, and ethanol two-bottle choice tasks, we validated that LIQ HD has superior accuracy compared to photobeam sensors. The system measures preference over time and changes in bout microstructure, with undisturbed recordings lasting up to 7 days. All designs and software are open-source to allow other researchers to build upon the system and adapt LIQ HD to their animal home cages.\n\nSignificance StatementTwo-bottle choice drinking tasks are traditionally performed by periodically weighing bottles, which is cumbersome and lacks temporal resolution. Several open-source tools have been developed to improve drink monitoring in various settings. However, no open-source devices have been designed specifically to investigate temporally precise two-bottle choice drinking behavior and bout microstructure during prolonged undisturbed tasks in mouse ventilated home cages at a large scale. Our design, LIQ HD (Lick Instance Quantifier Home cage Device), is a home cage compatible system that utilizes capacitive sensors for highly accurate lick detection during two-bottle choice tasks in up to 18 cages driven by a single Arduino microcontroller. The system is low-cost, easy to build, and controlled via touchscreen with an intuitive graphical user interface.",

    "abstract": "Between-participant differences in head motion introduce systematic bias to resting state fMRI brain-wide association studies (BWAS) that is not completely removed by denoising algorithms. Researchers who study traits, or phenotypes associated with in-scanner head motion (e.g. psychiatric disorders) need to know if trait-functional connectivity (FC) correlations are biased by residual motion artifact in order to avoid reporting false positive results. We devised an adaptable method, Split Half Analysis of Motion Associated Networks (SHAMAN), to assign a motion impact score to specific trait-FC correlations. The SHAMAN approach distinguishes between motion artifact causing false positive vs false negative bias. SHAMAN was > 95% specific at sample sizes of n = 100 and above. SHAMAN was 95% sensitive to detection of false positive motion impact score at sample sizes of n = 3,000 but only 59% sensitive to detection of false negative motion impact score, making it most useful for large BWAS. We computed motion impact scores for trait-FC correlations with 45 demographic, biophysical, cognitive, and personality traits from n = 7,270 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study. After standard denoising with ABCD-BIDS and without motion censoring, 60% (27/45) of traits had significant (p < 0.05) false positive motion impact scores and 36% (16/45) of traits had false negative motion impact scores. Censoring at framewise displacement (FD) < 0.2 mm reduced the proportion of traits with significant false positive motion impact scores from 60% to 2% (1/45) but did not decrease the number of traits with significant false negative motion impact scores.",

However, the effectiveness and safety of these approaches have been limited by the human head, which attenuates and distorts ultrasound strongly and unpredictably. To address this lingering barrier, we have developed a \"Relative Through-Transmit\" (RTT) approach that directly measures and compensates for the attenuation and distortion of a given skull and scalp. We have implemented RTT in hardware and demonstrated that it accurately restores the operators intended intensities inside ex-vivo human skulls. Moreover, this functionality enabled effective and intensity-dependent transcranial modulation of nerves and effective release of defined doses of propofol inside the skull. RTT was essential for these new applications of transcranial ultrasound; when not applied, there were no significant differences from sham conditions. Moreover, RTT was safely applied in humans and accounted for all intervening obstacles including hair and ultrasound coupling. This method and hardware unlock the potential of ultrasound-based approaches to provide effective, safe, and reproducible precision therapies of the brain.",

    "abstract": "During animal development, neurons often form exuberant or incorrect axons and dendrites at early stages, followed by the refinement of neuronal circuits at late stages. Neural circuit refinement leads to the production of large amounts of neuronal debris in the form of neuronal cell corpses, fragmented axons and dendrites, and pruned synapses requiring disposal. In particular, the predominant phagocytes acting during the neuronal remodeling and degeneration are glial cells and critical signaling pathways between neurons and glia leading to phagocytosis are required. Chemokine-like mushroom body neuron secreted Orion ligand was shown to be essential to the astrocyte infiltration into the {gamma} axon bundle leading to {gamma} axon pruning and clearance of debris left from axon fragmentation. Here we show a role of orion also in debris engulfment and phagocytosis. Interestingly, we show that orion is also involved in the overall transformation of astrocytes into phagocytes. In addition, analysis of several neuronal paradigms demonstrates the role of orion in the elimination of both peptidergic vCrz+ and PDF-Tri neurons via additional phagocytic glial cells as cortex and/or ensheathing glia. Our results suggest that Orion is essential for phagocytic activation of three different types of glial cells: astrocytes, cortex and ensheathing glia and point to Orion as a trigger not only of glial infiltration but also engulfment and phagocytosis.",

    "abstract": "The neural mechanisms that unfold when humans form a large group defined by an overarching context, such as audiences in theater or sports, are largely unknown and unexplored. This is mainly due to the lack of availability of a scalable system that can record the brain activity from a significantly large portion of such an audience simultaneously. Although the technology for such a system has been readily available for a long time, the high cost as well as the large overhead in human resources and logistic planning have prohibited the development of such a system. However, during the recent years reduction in technology costs and size have led to the emergence of low-cost, consumer-oriented EEG systems, developed primarily for recreational use. Here by combining such a low-cost EEG system with other off-the-shelve hardware and tailor-made software, we develop in the lab and test in a cinema such a scalable EEG hyper-scanning system. The system has a robust and stable performance and achieves accurate unambiguous alignment of the recorded data of the different EEG headsets. These characteristics combined with small preparation time and low-cost make it an ideal candidate for recording large portions of audiences.\n\nHighlightsA scalable EEG hyper-scanning system for recording audiences and large groups is presented with the following characteristics.

    "abstract": "Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate their genomes in virus-induced membrane vesicles, and the resulting RNA replication complexes are a major target for virus control. Nodavirus studies first revealed viral RNA replication proteins forming a 12-fold symmetric \"crown\" at the vesicle opening to the cytosol, an arrangement recently confirmed to extend to distantly related alphaviruses. Using cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), we show that mature nodavirus crowns comprise two stacked 12-mer rings of multi-domain viral RNA replication protein A. Each ring contains an ~19 nm circle of C-proximal polymerase domains, differentiated by strikingly diverged positions of N-proximal RNA capping/membrane binding domains. The lower ring is a \"proto-crown\" precursor that assembles prior to RNA template recruitment, RNA synthesis and replication vesicle formation. In this proto-crown, the N-proximal segments interact to form a toroidal central floor, whose 3.1 [A] resolution structure reveals many mechanistic details of the RNA capping/membrane binding domains. In the upper ring, cryo-EM fitting indicates that the N-proximal domains extend radially outside the polymerases, forming separated, membrane-binding \"legs.\" The polymerase and N-proximal domains are connected by a long linker accommodating the conformational switch between the two rings and possibly also polymerase movements associated with RNA synthesis and non-symmetric electron density in the lower center of mature crowns. The results reveal remarkable viral protein multifunctionality, conformational flexibility and evolutionary plasticity and new insights into (+)RNA virus replication and control.\n\nSignificancePositive-strand RNA viruses - including coronaviruses, alphaviruses, flaviviruses and many other medically and economically important pathogens - replicate their RNA genomes by virus-encoded machinery that has been poorly characterized. Using an advanced nodavirus model, we identify a major precursor in RNA replication complex assembly and show it to be a 12-mer ring of viral RNA replication protein A, whose single particle cryo-EM structure reveals functional features of its membrane interaction, assembly, polymerase and RNA capping domains. We further show that fully functional RNA replication complexes acquire a second 12-mer ring of protein A in alternate conformation atop the first, and a central density likely to represent another polymerase conformation. These findings provide strong foundations for understanding, controlling and beneficially using such viruses.",

However, it is largely unknown how the information is read by m6A reader proteins in heart failure. Here we show that the m6A reader protein Ythdf2 controls cardiac function and identified a novel mechanism how reader proteins control gene expression and cardiac function. Deletion of Ythdf2 in cardiomyocytes in vivo leads to cardiac hypertrophy, reduced heart function, and increased fibrosis during pressure overload as well as during aging. Similarly, in vitro the knockdown of Ythdf2 results in cardiomyocyte growth and remodeling. Mechanistically, we identified the eucaryotic elongation factor 2 as a major target of Ythdf2 using cell type specific Ribo-seq data. Our study expands our understanding on the regulatory functions of m6A methylation in cardiomyocytes and how cardiac function is controlled by the m6A reader protein Ythdf2.",

    "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests that posttranscriptional control of gene expression, including RNA splicing, transport, modification, translation, and degradation, primarily relies on RNA binding proteins (RBPs). However, the functions of many RBPs remain understudied. Here, we characterized the function of a novel RBP, Proline-Rich Coiled-coil 2B (PRRC2B). Through photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation and sequencing (PAR-CLIP-seq), we identified transcriptome-wide CU- or GA-rich PRRC2B binding sites near the translation initiation codon on a specific cohort of mRNAs in HEK293T cells. These mRNAs, including oncogenes and cell cycle regulators such as CCND2 (cyclin D2), exhibited decreased translation upon PRRC2B knockdown as revealed by polysome-associated RNA-seq, resulting in reduced G1/S phase transition and cell proliferation. Antisense oligonucleotides blocking PRRC2B interactions with CCND2 mRNA decreased its translation, thus inhibiting G1/S transition and cell proliferation. Mechanistically, PRRC2B interactome analysis revealed RNA-independent interactions with eukaryotic translation initiation factors 3 (eIF3) and 4G2 (eIF4G2). The interaction with translation initiation factors is essential for PRRC2B function since the eIF3/eIF4G2-interacting defective mutant, unlike wild-type PRRC2B, failed to rescue the translation deficiency or cell proliferation inhibition caused by PRRC2B knockdown. Altogether, our findings reveal that PRRC2B is essential for efficiently translating specific proteins required for cell cycle progression and cell proliferation.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=190 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520836v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cc9385org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e92f55org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1228c7corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1352179_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Sequencing of long coding RNAs informs about the abundance and the novelty in the transcriptome, while sequencing of short coding RNAs (e.g., microRNAs) or long non-coding RNAs informs about the epigenetic regulation of the transcriptome. Currently, each of these goals is addressed by separate sequencing experiments given the different physical characteristics of RNA species from biological samples. Sequencing of both short and long RNAs from the same experimental run has not been reported for long-read Nanopore sequencing to date and only recently has been achieved for short-read (Illumina) methods. We propose a library preparation method capable of simultaneously profiling short and long RNA reads in the same library on the Nanopore platform and provide the relevant bioinformatics workflows to support the goals of RNA quantification. Using a variety of synthetic samples we demonstrate that the proposed method can simultaneously detect short and long RNAs in a manner that is linear over 5 orders of magnitude for RNA abundance and three orders of magnitude for RNA length. In biological samples the proposed method is capable of profiling a wider variety of short and long non-coding RNAs when compared against the existing Smart-seq protocols for Illumina and Nanopore sequencing.",

    "abstract": "The costs and benefits of learning for a foraging organism are difficult to quantify, and depend sensitively on the environment. We construct a minimal mathematical model of learning in which a forager learns the quality of different food types through experience. In our model, learning depends on two parameters: rate of memory updating and rate of exploration. Our method returns optimal learning parameters for environments in which the value and variance of food types may change in any fashion. We analyze the effect of five components of environmental change on the optimal memory and exploration parameters. The fitness outcomes from learning foragers are compared to the outcomes from following fixed strategies, explicitly quantifying the fitness benefit (or cost) of learning as a function of environmental change. We find that variance in resource values negatively biases foragers estimates for those values, potentially explaining experimental results showing that animals prefer less variable resources. Learning is beneficial only if memory and exploration are optimized. The benefit of learning is largely determined by the ratio between the overall expected value of taking one resource compared to the overall expected value of taking the other: As these two expectations diverge, the fitness benefit of learning decreases, and can even become negative. In many environments, sub-optimal learning performs as bad or even worse than following a fixed strategy.\n\nSignificanceLearning is commonly observed in foraging organisms. However, measuring the fitness benefits (and costs) of learning is difficult, and depends critically on the environment in which an organism lives. We build a minimal model of learning in the context of optimal foraging and optimal diet choice theory, with two learning parameters: , corresponding to the duration of the foragers memory, and{epsilon} , corresponding to how much the forager explores the environment to learn more about it. We identify the optimal ,{epsilon} for different types of environmental change, and quantify the benefits and costs of learning. The benefit of learning is often surprisingly small, and in many environments, learning provides lower fitness than following a fixed strategy.",

    "abstract": "The CD4 or CD8 co-receptors interaction with the protein-tyrosine kinase Lck is widely accepted as the initiator of the tyrosine phosphorylation cascade leading to T-cell activation. These co-receptors potentially enhance T-cell antigen sensitivity, but how they function is still debated. A critical question is: to what extent are co-receptors and signal-initiating Lck coupled? Our contribution concerns the small - but indispensable for CD4- and CD8-Lck formation - element Zn2+. The intracellular Zn2+ pool is strictly buffered but undergoes dynamic changes, also reported during T-cell activation. Furthermore, the identical Zn2+-binding cysteinyl residues may alter co-receptor dimerization or heterodimerization with Lck. Following initial research demonstrating a significant difference in the affinity of Zn2+ to CD4 and CD4-Lck in solution, we combined biochemical and cellular approaches to show that fluctuations of buffered Zn2+ in physiological ranges indeed influence Zn(CD4)2 and Zn(CD4)(Lck). This conclusion was supported by the simulation of complexes equilibria, demonstrating that Zn2+ changes can alter the molar ratio between those complexes. In T cells, increased intracellular free Zn2+ concentration causes higher CD4 partitioning in the plasma membrane by a still unknown mechanism. We additionally found that CD4 palmitoylation decreases the specificity of CD4-Lck formation in the reconstituted membrane model, suggesting that this reversible modification may also be involved. Our findings help elucidate co-receptor-Lck coupling stoichiometry and demonstrate that intracellular free Zn2+ has a major role in the interplay between CD4 dimers and CD4-Lck assembly.",

    "abstract": "Membrane curvature is essential to diverse cellular functions. While classically attributed to structured domains, recent work illustrates that intrinsically disordered proteins are also potent drivers of membrane bending. Specifically, repulsive interactions among disordered domains drive convex bending, while attractive interactions, which lead to liquid-like condensates, drive concave bending. How might disordered domains that contain both repulsive and attractive domains impact curvature? Here we examine chimeras that combine attractive and repulsive interactions. When the attractive domain was closer to the membrane, its condensation amplified steric pressure among repulsive domains, leading to convex curvature. In contrast, when the repulsive domain was closer to the membrane, attractive interactions dominated, resulting in concave curvature. Further, a transition from convex to concave curvature occurred with increasing ionic strength, which reduced repulsion while enhancing condensation. In agreement with a simple mechanical model, these results illustrate a set of design rules for membrane bending by disordered proteins.",

However, while control of time-varying E/I balance is considered essential for perceptual and motor learning, an efficient method for estimating E/I balance changes has yet to be established. To tackle this issue, we propose a new method to estimate E/I balance changes by applying neural-mass model-based tracking of the brain state using the Ensemble Kalman Filter. In this method, the parameters of synaptic E/I gains in the model are estimated from observed electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Moreover, the index of E/I balance was defined by calculating the ratio between synaptic E/I gains based on estimated parameters. The method was validated by showing that it could estimate E/I balance changes from human EEG data at the sub-second scale, indicating that it has the potential to quantify how time-varying changes in E/I balance influence changes in perceptual and motor learning. Furthermore, this method could be used to develop an E/I balance-based neurofeedback training method for clinical use.",

In neurolinguistics, however, the effect of stimulus modality on language processing has gained little attention. We conducted a multi-modal event-related potential (ERP) experiment on both native and non-native Spanish speakers to investigate the possibility of a neurophysiological modality effect in language processing. Using morphosyntactically violated and orthographically/phonologically violated stimuli, we elicited a robust N400 and P600 in native speakers. We showed that the N400 has consistent features across modalities, while the P600 has modality-specific features. Specifically, the auditory evoked P600 was characterized by a more gradual slope and a later peak than the visual evoked P600. We discuss this in detail along with other modality effects observed post sensory perception. Among second language (L2) learner groups, those with higher proficiency exhibited more nativelike neurophysiological responses in both modalities when compared to those with lower proficiency. We additionally observed fewer modality-specific differences in low proficiency learners than in higher proficiency learners suggesting that modality-specific specialization in language processing comes with increased proficiency. We further discuss the question of modality-specific differences in the process of neurophysiological nativization, whereby L2 learners ERPs become increasingly on nativelike.",

    "abstract": "Leaf mesophyll-colonizing bacterial pathogens infect their plant hosts by adjusting their metabolism to the leaf mesophyll environment. Soon after the inoculation of naive, susceptible plants, the model bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PstDC3000) expresses virulence factors that suppress plant immunity, a requirement to produce robust infections. However, if plant immunity was elicited with Microbe-Associated Molecular-Patterns (MAMPs) prior to bacterial inoculation, PstDC3000 slows down virulence expression and only produces symptomless mild infections. To understand how bacterial metabolism adapts to these two contrasting conditions, we created iPst19, an in silico ensemble of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. Constraining the in silico growth of iPst19 with in planta PstDC3000 gene expression data revealed that sugar catabolism is highly active in bacteria that have been inoculated in mock-treated plants. In contrast, branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) catabolism is highly active in bacteria that have been inoculated in MAMP-pretreated plants. Bacterial growth and gene expression analysis showed that BCAAs suppress virulence gene expression without affecting bacterial growth in vitro. In planta, however, BCAAs suppress the expression of virulence genes at the early stages of the infection and significantly impair leaf colonization of the host plant Arabidopsis thaliana. While the overexpression of the conserved bacterial leucine-responsive transcriptional regulator Lrp induced the expression of virulence genes, its downregulation had the opposite effect, suggesting that BCAA-free Lrp induces virulence while BCAA-Lrp does not. Overall, our data provide mechanistic connections to understand how plant immunity impacts PstDC3000 metabolism and virulence, furthering our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis and plant disease.",

In contrast, rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) supported productive infection with both ZIKV and SPONV and developed robust neutralizing antibody responses. Crossover serial challenge in rhesus macaques revealed that SPONV immunity did not protect against ZIKV infection, whereas ZIKV immunity was fully protective against SPONV infection.

    "abstract": "Loss of solubility usually leads to the detrimental elimination of protein function. In some cases, the protein aggregation is also required for beneficial functions. Given the duality of this phenomenon, it remains a fundamental question how natural selection controls the aggregation. The exponential growth of genomic sequence data and recent progress with in silico predictors of the aggregation allows approaching this problem by a large-scale bioinformatics analysis. Most of the aggregation-prone regions are hidden within the 3D structures and, therefore, they cannot realize their potential to aggregate. Thus, the most realistic census of the aggregation prone regions requires crossing aggregation prediction with information about the location of the natively unfolded regions. This allows us to detect so-called \"Exposed Aggregation-prone Regions\" (EARs). Here, we analyzed the occurrence and distribution of the EARs in 76 full reference proteomes from the three kingdoms of life. For this purpose, we used a bioinformatics pipeline, which provides a consensual result based on several predictors of aggregation. Our analysis revealed a number of new statistically significant correlations about the presence of EARs in different organisms, their dependence on protein length, cellular localizations, co-occurrence with short linear motifs, and the level of protein expression. We also obtained a list of proteins with the conserved aggregation-prone sequences for further experimental tests.

    "abstract": "Meiosis-specific Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 complexes are thought to enable Spo11-mediated DNA double-strand-break (DSB) formation through a mechanism that involves DNA-dependent condensation. However, the structure, molecular properties, and evolutionary conservation of Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 are unclear. Here, we present AlphaFold structures of Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 complexes, supported by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and mutagenesis. We show that dimers composed of the Rec114 C-terminus form -helical chains that cup an N-terminal Mei4 -helix, and that Mer2 forms a parallel homotetrameric coiled coil. Both Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 bind preferentially to branched DNA substrates, indicative of multivalent protein-DNA interactions. Indeed, the Rec114-Mei4 interaction domain contains two DNA-binding sites that point in opposite directions and drive condensation. The Mer2 coiled-coil domain bridges co-aligned DNA duplexes, likely through extensive electrostatic interactions along the length of the coiled coil. Finally, we show that the structure of Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 are conserved across eukaryotes, while DNA-binding properties vary significantly. This work provides insights into the mechanism whereby Rec114-Mei4 and Mer2 complexes promote the assembly of the meiotic DSB machinery, and suggests a model where Mer2 condensation is the essential driver of assembly, with the DNA-binding activity of Rec114-Mei4 playing a supportive role.",

    "abstract": "Biological aging results from the age-dependent change in the force of natural selection, which increases the probability of germline variants that limit survival to accumulate in genes acting predominantly in late life1. The evolutionary mechanisms underlying the accumulation of neutral mutations and antagonistically pleiotropic gene variants that cause biological aging have been analyzed to date under the assumption of infinitely large population size. However, even though population size importantly shapes genetic and phenotype variation via drift and selection2,3, we still have a limited understanding of how finite population size impacts the evolution of mortality at the population level. Here, we study the impact of population size on lifespan evolution under mutation accumulation and antagonistic pleiotropy. We found that larger population size leads to lower age-independent, as well as age-dependent mortality under mutation accumulation, due to more effective purifying selection against deleterious germline variants. Strikingly, large population size can lead to extended lifespan under antagonistic pleiotropy, due to more effective positive selection on gene variants increasing survival in early-life, while leading to increased post-maturation mortality. Our findings provide a comprehensive numerical framework for the two major evolutionary genetic theories of aging and reveal a fundamental and yet non-appreciated role for population size in the evolution of mortality trajectories.",

    "abstract": "The alphaproteobacterium Wolbachia pipientis infects arthropod and nematode species worldwide, making it a key target for host biological control. Wolbachia-driven host reproductive manipulations, such as cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), are credited for catapulting these intracellular bacteria to high frequencies in host populations. Positive, perhaps mutualistic, reproductive manipulations also increase infection frequencies, but are not well understood. Here, we identify molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Wolbachia influences the molecularly distinct processes of GSC self renewal and differentiation. We demonstrate that wMel infection rescues the fertility of flies lacking the translational regulator mei-P26, and is sufficient to sustain infertile homozygous mei-P26-knockdown stocks indefinitely. Cytology revealed that wMel mitigates the impact of mei-P26 loss through restoring proper pMad, Bam, Sxl, and Orb expression. In OreR files with wild-type fertility, wMel infection elevates lifetime egg hatch rates. Exploring these phenotypes through dual-RNAseq experiments revealed that wMel infection rescues and offsets many gene expression changes induced by mei-P26 loss at the mRNA level. Overall, we show that wMel infection beneficially reinforces host fertility at mRNA, protein, and phenotypic levels, and these mechanisms may promote the emergence of mutualism and the breakdown of host reproductive manipulations.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=92 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/520626v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@151904corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d86e41org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e768eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@697109_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Highlights[bullet] The wMel strain of Wolbachia restores fertility in females and males deficient for the essential translational regulator meiotic-P26\n[bullet]Mei-P26s germline maintenance and oocyte cyst differentiation functions are genetically rescued by wMel infection\n[bullet]Perturbed pMad, Sxl, Bam, and Orb protein expression are mitigated by wMel infection\n[bullet]wMel infection elevates lifetime egg lay and hatch rates in OreR flies\n[bullet]Ovary transcriptomes reveal wMel infection restores or offsets changes in gene expression induced by the loss of functional mei-P26\n\n\nSignificance StatementWolbachia bacterial symbionts are being harnessed as biological control agents through the use of their costly manipulations to host fertility.

Historically, it inhabited open grassland across Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and southwestern Asia; however, only small and fragmented populations remain today. Here, we present a de novo genome assembly of the cheetah based on PacBio continuous long reads and Hi-C proximity ligation data. The final assembly (VMU_Ajub_asm_v1.0) has a total length of 2.38 Gb, of which 99.7% are anchored into the expected 19 chromosome-scale scaffolds. The contig and scaffold N50 values of 96.8 Mb and 144.4 Mb, respectively, a BUSCO completeness of 95.4% and a k-mer completeness of 98.4%, emphasize the high quality of the assembly. Furthermore, annotation of the assembly identified 23,622 genes and a repeat content of 40.4%. This new highly contiguous and chromosome-scale assembly will greatly benefit conservation and evolutionary genomic analyses and will be a valuable resource, e.g., to gain a detailed understanding of the function and diversity of immune response genes in felids.",

    "abstract": "The genetic code is one of the most highly conserved features across life. Only a few lineages have deviated from the \"universal\" genetic code. Amongst the few variants of the genetic code reported to date, the codons UAA and UAG virtually always have the same translation, suggesting that their evolution is coupled. Here, we report the genome and transcriptome sequencing of a novel ciliate, belonging to the Oligohymenophorea class, where the translation of the UAA and UAG stop codons have changed to specify different amino acids. Genomic and transcriptomic analyses revealed that UAA has been reassigned to encode lysine, while UAG has been reassigned to encode glutamic acid. We identified multiple suppressor tRNA genes with anticodons complementary to the reassigned codons. We show that the retained UGA stop codon is enriched in the 3UTR immediately downstream of the coding region of genes, suggesting that there is functional drive to maintain tandem stop codons. Using a phylogenomics approach, we reconstructed the ciliate phylogeny and mapped genetic code changes, highlighting the remarkable number of independent genetic code changes within the Ciliophora group of protists. According to our knowledge, this is the first report of a genetic code variant where UAA and UAG encode different amino acids.",

    "abstract": "Chemically induced protein degradation is a powerful strategy for perturbing cellular biochemistry. The predominant mechanism of action for protein degrader drugs involves induced proximity between the cellular ubiquitin conjugation machinery and the target. Unlike traditional small molecule enzyme inhibition, targeted protein degradation can clear an undesired protein from cells. We demonstrate here the use of peptide ligands for Kelch-Like Homology Domain Containing protein 2 (KLHDC2), a substrate adaptor protein and member of the cullin-2 (CUL2) ubiquitin ligase complex, for targeted protein degradation. Peptide-based bivalent compounds that can induce proximity between KLHDC2 and target proteins cause degradation of the targeted factors. The cellular activity of these compounds depends on KLHDC2 binding. This work demonstrates the utility of KLHDC2 for targeted protein degradation and exemplifies a strategy for the rational design of new peptide-based ligands useful for this purpose.",

    "abstract": "The impact of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) on slowing the global human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic hinges on effective drugs and delivery platforms. Oral regimens have represented the pillar of HIV PrEP for years. However, variable adherence has spurred development of long-acting delivery systems, which also aim at increasing PrEP access, uptake and persistence. Here we present an ultra-long-acting and transcutaneously refillable subcutaneous nanofluidic implant for constant and sustained release of islatravir (ISL), a nucleoside reverse transcriptase translocation inhibitor, for HIV PrEP. In rhesus macaques, the ISL-eluting implants (nISL) achieved constant plasma ISL levels (median 3.14 nM) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) ISL-triphosphate levels (ISL-TP) (median 0.16 pmol/106 cells) for over 20 months uninterrupted. These drug concentrations are above the established PrEP protection threshold. In two non-blinded, placebo-controlled studies with repeated low-dose rectal and vaginal SHIVSF162P3 challenges in male and female rhesus macaques, respectively, nISL implants conferred 100% protection against infection (p=0.0005 and 0.0009, respectively between nISL and placebo control groups). The nISL implants were well tolerated with mild local tissue inflammation and no signs of systemic toxicity over the 20-month period. Overall, our refillable nISL implant is a promising ultra-long-acting delivery technology for HIV PrEP.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAn ultra-long-acting and subcutaneous refillable nanofluidic implant achieved preventive levels of islatravir in non-human primates for 20 months without refilling and conferred 100% protection against rectal and vaginal SHIV transmission.",

    "abstract": "Sensitive detection of Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (TB) in small percentages in metagenomic samples is essential for microbial classification and drug resistance prediction, and assisting in diagnosis and treatment planning. However, traditional methods, such as bacterial culture and microscopy, are time-consuming and sometimes have limited TB detection sensitivity. Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION sequencing allows rapid and simple sample preparation for whole genome and amplicon sequencing. Its recently developed adaptive sequencing selects reads from targets, while allowing real-time base-calling during sequencing to achieve sequence enrichment or depletion. Another common enrichment method is PCR amplification of the target TB genes. In this study, we compared both methods with MinION sequencing for TB detection and variant calling in metagenomic samples using both simulation runs and those with synthetic and patient samples. We found that both methods effectively enrich TB reads from a high percentage of human and other microbial DNA. We provide a simple automatic analysis framework, including quality filtering, taxonomic classification, variant calling, and antimicrobial resistance prediction, to support these detection workflows for clinical use, openly available at https://github.com/HKU-BAL/ONT-TB-NF. Depending on the patients medical condition and sample type (commonly including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, blood samples, sputum, and tissues), we discuss the findings and recommend that users optimize their workflow to improve the detection limit.",

Furthermore, mammals express different isoforms, with only slight variations at the amino acid level. While the -skeletal actin isoform was thoroughly studied using molecular dynamics simulations, the dynamics of the {beta}-actin isoform remains unexplored. Here, we have used the AMOEBA polarizable force field coupled with adaptive sampling to investigate the plasticity of the {beta}-actin. This highlighted the role of a post translational modification, i.e. the histidine 73 methylation, to enhance the opening of the actin cleft and change allosteric paths linking the two distant subdomains SD2 and SD4. The action of the methylation can be also modulated by the type of nucleotide bound in the actin cavity and the type of ions surrounding the protein. Taken together, these results shed new lights onto the plasticity of the {beta}-actin isoform and the coordinated role of several environmental factors. These results may help designing new types of molecules, such as allosteric modulators, specifically targeting the {beta}-actin isoform.",

    "abstract": "Dengue virus (DENV) is endemic in over 100 countries, infecting an estimated 400 million individuals every year. Infection with DENV raises a significant antibody response, primarily consisting of antibodies targeting viral (structural) proteins. However, not all DENV antigens are part of the virion itself, as the DENV genome encodes several non-structural (NS) proteins. One of these, NS1, has been shown to be antigenic and is expressed on the membrane of DENV-infected cells. IgG and IgA isotype antibodies that bind NS1 are detectable in serum following DENV infection and are also capable of interacting with Fc receptors expressed on professional phagocytes. Our study aims to determine if NS1-binding IgG and IgA isotype antibodies contribute to the clearance of DENV-infected cells by professional phagocytes through antibody mediated phagocytosis/trogocytosis. Using an in vitro model of trogocytosis we observed that both IgG and IgA isotype antibodies can facilitate facilitating monocytic uptake of DENV NS1 expressing plasma membrane in an additive fashion. This process was dependent on the expression of Fc{gamma}RI (CD64) and FcR (CD89) for IgG and IgA mediated membrane uptake, respectively. Furthermore, this process was antagonized by the presence of soluble NS1, suggesting that the production of soluble NS1 by infected cells may serve as an immunological chaff, thereby antagonizing opsonization and clearance of infected cells by NS1-specific IgG and IgA isotype antibodies.",

    "abstract": "High-temperature stress is critical for all organisms and induces a profound cellular response. For Crenarchaeota, little information is available on how heat shock affects cellular processes and on how this response is regulated. In this work, we set out to study heat shock response in the thermoacidophilic model crenarchaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, which thrives in volcanic hot springs and has an optimal growth temperature of 75{degrees}C. Pulse-labeling experiments demonstrated that a temperature shift to 86{degrees}C induces a drastic reduction of the transcriptional and translational activity, but that RNA and protein neosynthesis still occurs. By combining RNA sequencing and TMT-labeled mass spectrometry, an integrated mapping of the transcriptome and proteome was performed. This revealed that heat shock causes an immediate change in the gene expression profile, with RNA levels of half of the genes being affected, followed by the more subtle reprogramming of the protein landscape. A limited correlation was observed in differential expression on the RNA and protein level, suggesting that there is a prevalence of post-transcriptional and post-translational regulation upon heat shock. Furthermore, based on the finding that promoter regions of heat shock regulon genes lack a conserved DNA-binding motif, we propose that heat-shock responsive transcription regulation is likely not to be accomplished by a classical transcription factor. Instead, in contrast to histone-harboring Euryarchaeota that have heat-shock transcription factors, it is hypothesized that Sulfolobales and other histone-lacking thermophilic archaea employ an evolutionary ancient mechanism relying on temperature-responsive changes in DNA organization and compaction, induced by the action of nucleoid-associated proteins.",

    "abstract": "Flower strips are a common agricultural practice to increase aboveground biodiversity and beneficial ecosystem services. Although soil communities are a key component of terrestrial biodiversity and drive important ecosystem services, their abundance, diversity, and composition in flower strips remain largely unexplored. Here, we shed light on earthworms and soil microorganisms in flower strips and aim to provide a starting point for research on belowground communities in flower strips. In 2020, we established a field margin vegetation as well as two annual and two perennial flower strip mixtures at three study sites in Germany that were previously conventional croplands or fallow. Two years following this conversion, we determined earthworm communities and investigated the soil microbiome using real-time PCR (archaea, bacteria, fungi, and soil-N-cycling genes) and amplicon sequencing (bacteria and fungi). Different plant mixtures (i.e. field margin, annual, and perennial flower strips) harbored distinct earthworm and soil microbial communities. Earthworm density and biomass declined or remained unaffected in annual flower strips but increased in perennial flower strips as compared to field margins. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi showed greater diversity and community share in non-tilled (i.e. field margin and perennial flower strips) as compared to tilled plant mixtures (i.e. annual flower strips). We attribute changes in earthworms and microorganisms mainly to the effect of tillage and plant diversity. Overall, we suggest that perennial flower strips serve as refugia for soil biota in agricultural landscapes. Future studies should compare soil biota in perennial flower strips to those in adjacent fields and investigate whether beneficial belowground effects are restricted to the flower strips or spatially extend into adjacent fields ( spillover).",

    "abstract": "I examined changes in stored lipid over the parental care interval in several populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus). Males from the limnetic populations and the marine population decreased in stored lipids over the progression of the nesting interval. Of the two benthic populations, one (Hotel Lake) did not decrease stored lipids over the parental care interval, as predicted, whereas the other (Crystal Lake) showed declining stored lipids over the parental care interval. Though food resources are likely high in the nesting area of Crystal Lake, the high density of conspecific cannibal groups in the littoral zone likely contributes to reduced foraging and elevated guarding/diversionary display behaviour and dependency on stored lipids to fuel those behaviours in the Crystal Lake (benthic) population. This study demonstrates the value of considering different ecological conditions on behavioural and energetic constraints among populations of threespine stickleback.",

    "abstract": "De novo mutations (DNMs) in the germline have long been identified as a key element in the causes of developmental and other genetic disorders. Previous attempts to investigate genetic factors affecting DNMs have suffered from a lack of statistical power, due to the difficulty of obtaining a sufficient number of parent-offspring trios. Thus, the rare disease cohort of the UKs 100k Genomes Project (100kGP), comprising more than 10,000 trios, represents an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the genetics of germline mutation. Here we estimate SNP heritability of DNM count in offspring, as a measure of the relative contribution of genetic factors to the variance of the trait, in a PCA-selected subset of the 100kGP cohort. We estimate separate SNP heritabilities for paternally and maternally transmitted mutations (based on parentally phased DNMs in offspring), computed using parental genetic variants at a range of minimum frequencies and a variety of methodologies. We estimate a heritability of 10-20% for paternal DNMs; by contrast, for maternal DNMs we find no significant evidence for non-zero heritability. We investigated the partitioning of heritability among genes with different expression profiles in different tissue or cell states, and found a relative heritability enrichment for genes expressed in gonadal tissues, particularly testis. Among germ cells in adult testes we observed relative enrichment of heritability in genes associated with the (undifferentiated) spermatogonial stem cell state.",

    "abstract": "IS1202, originally isolated from Streptococcus pneumonia in the mid-1990s had been previously tagged as an emerging IS family in ISfinder. While searching for plasmid-associated Xer recombinase recombination sites (xrs) in Acinetobacter baumannii, we observed that some insertion sequences related to IS1202 were repeatedly found abutting these sites in a number of plasmids. The plasmids often carried repeated xrs thought to form a new type of mobile genetic element (MGE) which uses the chromosomally-encoded XerCD recombinase for mobility. The MGE (xrs cassette) consist of xrs flanking one or a small number of genes often including different clinically important carbapenemase-encoding bla-OXA. The IS1202- related IS are inserted with their left, transposase proximal extremity, IRL, five base pairs from xrs and include a characteristic 5bp flanking target duplication. Further searches revealed that many different plasmid- and chromosome-borne xrs can be targeted and that IS1202-xrs combinations are not limited to Acinetobacter baumannii but occur in other bacteria.\n\nIn addition to 28 IS1202 group ISs in ISfinder and a number which had been subsequently submitted, we undertook a survey of the NCBI (February 2020) and identified 138 additional IS1202-related IS. These could be divided into 3 principal subgroups based on their transposase sequences and on the length of the DR generated on insertion: subgroup IS1202 27-28bp DR); ISTde1 (15-17bp); and ISAba32 (5-6bp). Members of each group which lacked DR were also found. But since other examples of most of these were subsequently identified having DR, those lacking DR may have been generated by intra-replicon recombination. Only members of the group which generate 5bp DR were found to target xrs. These were not only identified in plasmids but also occurred at some individual xrs sites, dif, located at the chromosome replication terminus and involved in post-replication chromosome segregation. Further analysis showed the presence of subgroup-specific indels in their transposases which may be responsible for the differences in their behavior.\n\nWe propose that this collection of IS be classed as a new insertion sequence family: the IS1202 family composed of at three subfamilies, only one of which specifically targets plasmid-borne xrs. We discuss the implications of xrs targeting for gene mobility.",

    "abstract": "New vaccine platforms that properly activate humoral immunity and generate neutralizing antibodies are required to combat emerging and re-emerging pathogens, including influenza virus. Biomaterial scaffolds with macroscale porosity have demonstrated tremendous promise in regenerative medicine where they have been shown to allow immune cell infiltration and subsequent activation, but whether these types of materials can serve as an immunization platform is unknown. We developed an injectable immunization platform that uses a slurry of antigen-loaded hydrogel microparticles that anneal to form a porous scaffold with high surface area for antigen uptake by infiltrating immune cells as the biomaterial degrades to maximize humoral immunity. Antigen-loaded-microgels elicited a robust cellular humoral immune response, with increased CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells and prolonged germinal center (GC) B cells comparable to the commonly used adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide (Alum). By simply increasing the weight fraction of polymer material, we enhanced material stiffness and further increased antigen-specific antibody titers superior to Alum. Vaccinating mice with inactivated influenza virus loaded into this more highly crosslinked formulation elicited a strong antibody response and provided better protection against a high dose viral challenge than Alum. Thus, we demonstrate that by tuning physical and chemical properties alone, we can enhance adjuvanticity and promote humoral immunity and protection against a pathogen, leveraging two different types of antigenic material: individual protein antigen and inactivated virus. The flexibility of the platform may enable design of new vaccines to enhance innate and adaptive immune cell programming to generate and tune high affinity antibodies, a promising approach to generate long-lasting immunity against specific pathogens.",
