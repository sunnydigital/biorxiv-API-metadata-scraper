    "abstract": "Cell lineage tree reconstruction methods are developed for various tasks, such as investigating the development, differentiation, and cancer progression. Single-cell sequencing technologies enable more thorough analysis with higher resolution. We present Scuphr, a distance-based cell lineage tree reconstruction method using bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing data from healthy tissues. Common challenges of single-cell DNA sequencing, such as allelic dropouts and amplification errors, are included in Scuphr. Scuphr computes the distance between cell pairs and reconstructs the lineage tree using the neighbor-joining algorithm. With its embarrassingly parallel design, Scuphr can do faster analysis than the state-of-the-art methods while obtaining better accuracy. The methods robustness is investigated using various synthetic datasets and a biological dataset of 18 cells.\n\nAuthor summaryCell lineage tree reconstruction carries a significant potential for studies of development and medicine. The lineage tree reconstruction task is especially challenging for cells taken from healthy tissue due to the scarcity of mutations. In addition, the single-cell whole-genome sequencing technology introduces artifacts such as amplification errors, allelic dropouts, and sequencing errors. We propose Scuphr, a probabilistic framework to reconstruct cell lineage trees. We designed Scuphr for single-cell DNA sequencing data; it accounts for technological artifacts in its graphical model and uses germline heterozygous sites to improve its accuracy. Scuphr is embarrassingly parallel; the speed of the computational analysis is inversely proportional to the number of available computational nodes. We demonstrated that Scuphr is fast, robust, and more accurate than the state-of-the-art method with the synthetic data experiments. Moreover, in the biological data experiment, we showed Scuphr successfully identifies different clones and further obtains more support on closely related cells within clones.",

    "abstract": "Eye tracking studies suggest that refixations, fixations to locations previously visited, serve to recover information lost or missed during earlier exploration of a visual scene. These studies have largely ignored the role of precursor fixations, previous fixations on locations the eyes return to later. We consider the possibility that preparations to return later are already made during precursor fixations. This would mark precursor fixations as a special category of fixations, i.e., distinct in neural activity from other fixation categories such as refixations and fixations to locations visited only once. To capture the neural signals associated with fixation categories, we analyzed EEG and eye movement recorded simultaneously in a free-viewing contour search task. We developed a methodological pipeline involving regression-based deconvolution modeling, allowing our analyses to account for overlapping EEG responses due to the saccade sequence and other oculomotor covariates. We found that precursor fixations were preceded by the largest saccades among the fixation categories. Independently of the effect of saccade length, EEG amplitude was enhanced in precursor fixations compared to the other fixation categories 200-400 ms after fixation onsets, most noticeably over the occipital areas. We concluded that precursor fixations play a pivotal role in visual perception, marking the continuous occurrence of transitions between exploratory and exploitative modes of eye movement in natural viewing behavior.",

However, the cellular and molecular changes elicited by exercise have not been systematically studied across a broad range of cell types in stem cell compartments. To gain better insight into the mechanisms by which exercise affects niche and stem cell function, we subjected young and old mice to aerobic exercise and generated a single cell transcriptomic atlas of muscle, neural and hematopoietic stem cells with their niche cells and progeny.\n\nComplementarily, we also performed whole transcriptome analysis of single myofibers from these animals. We identified common and unique pathways that are compromised across these tissues and cell types in aged animals. We found that exercise has a rejuvenating effect on subsets of stem cells, and a profound impact in the composition and transcriptomic landscape of both circulating and tissue resident immune cells. Exercise ameliorated the upregulation of a number of inflammatory pathways as well as restored aspects of cell-cell communication within these stem cell compartments. Our study provides a comprehensive view of the coordinated responses of multiple aged stem cells and niche cells to exercise at the transcriptomic level.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEmerging studies have suggested an essential role of fibroblast metabolic reprogramming in the pathogenesis of arthrofibrosis. The metabolic modulator metformin appears to be a therapeutic candidate for fibrotic disorders. However, whether metformin could alleviate arthrofibrosis has not been defined. In this study we have determined if treatment with metformin has the beneficial effect on arthrofibrosis and its underlying mechanism.\n\nMethodsArticular capsule samples were collected from patients with/without arthrofibrosis to perform gene and protein expression analysis. Arthrofibrosis animal model was established to examine the anti-fibrotic effect of metformin. Cell culture experiments were conducted to determine the mechanism by which metformin inhibits fibroblast activation.\n\nResultsWe found that glycolysis was upregulated in human fibrotic articular capsules. In an arthrofibrosis animal model, intra-articular injection of metformin mitigated inflammatory reactions, downregulated expression of both fibrotic and glycolytic markers, improved range of motion of the joint, and reduced capsular fibrosis and thickening. At the cellular level, metformin inhibited the activation of fibroblasts and mitigated the abundant influx of glucose into activated fibroblasts. Interestingly, metformin prompted a metabolic shift from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in activated fibroblasts, resulting in the anti-fibrotic effect of metformin.\n\nConclusionMetformin decreased glycolysis, causing a metabolic shift toward aerobic glycolysis in activated fibroblasts and has beneficial effect on the treatment of arthrofibrosis.\n\nThe translational potential of this articleThe finding of this study demonstrated the therapeutic effect of metformin on arthrofibrosis and defined novel targets for the treatment of articular fibrotic disorders.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) from fatty liver to steatohepatitis using single-nucleus and bulk ATAC-seq on the livers of rats fed a high-fat diet (HFD). Rats fed HFD for 4 weeks developed fatty liver, and those fed HFD for 8 weeks further progressed to steatohepatitis. We observed an increase in the proportion of inflammatory macrophages, consistent with the pathological progression. Utilizing machine learning, we divided global gene regulation into modules, wherein transcription factors within a module could regulate genes within the same module, reaffirming known regulatory relationships between transcription factors and biological processes. We identified core genes--central to co-expression and protein-protein interaction--for the biological processes discovered. Notably, a large part of the core genes overlapped with genes previously implicated in NAFLD. Single-nucleus ATAC-seq, combined with data-driven statistical analysis, offers insight into in vivo global gene regulation as a combination of modules and assists in identifying core genes of relevant biological processes.\n\nSummary blurbThis study uncovers cell type-specific global gene regulation in NAFLD progression, identifying core genes and shedding light on the diseases molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Modulation of export of photoassimilates from the chloroplast is essential for controlling the distribution of fixed carbon in the cell and maintaining optimum photosynthetic rates. In this study we identified chloroplast triose phosphate/phosphate translocators 2 and 3 (CreTPT2 and CreTPT3) in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that exhibited similar substrate specificities but were differentially expressed over the diel cycle. We focused mostly on analyzing CreTPT3 because of its high level of expression and the severe phenotype exhibited by tpt3 relative to the tpt2 mutants. Null mutants for CreTPT3 had a pleiotropic phenotype that impacted growth, photosynthetic activities, metabolite profiles, carbon partitioning, and organelle-specific accumulation of H2O2. These analyses demonstrated that CreTPT3 is a dominant conduit on the chloroplast envelope for the transport of photoassimilate. In addition, CreTPT3 can serve as a safety valve that moves excess reductant out of the chloroplast and appears to be essential for preventing the cells from experiencing oxidative stress and accumulating of reactive oxygen species, even under low/moderate light intensities. Finally, our studies indicate subfunctionalization of the CreTPT transporters and suggest that there are differences in managing the export of photoassimilates from the chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas and vascular plants.",

    "abstract": "Three dynamin isoforms play critical roles in clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters host cells via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. We previously reported that 3-(3-chloro-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[b,f]azepin-5-yl)-N,N-dimethylpropan-1-amine (clomipramine) inhibits the GTPase activity of dynamin 1, which is in mainly neuron. Therefore, we investigated whether clomipramine inhibits the activity of other dynamin isoforms in this study. We found that, similar to its inhibitory effect on dynamin 1, clomipramine inhibited the L--phosphatidyl-L-serine-stimulated GTPase activity of dynamin 2, which is expressed ubiquitously, and dynamin 3, which is expressed in the lung. Inhibition of GTPase activity raises the possibility that clomipramine can suppress SARS-CoV-2 entry into host cells.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=99 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/507370v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (18K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1896b12org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d474c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3dc012org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cf368_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The discovery of a new neurotransmitter, especially one in the central nervous system (CNS), is both important and difficult. We have been searching for new neurotransmitters for 12 years. We detected creatine (Cr) in synaptic vesicles (SVs), at a level lower than glutamate (Glu) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but higher than acetylcholine (ACh) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT). SV Cr was reduced in mice lacking either arginine:glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT, a Cr synthetase) or SLC6A8, a Cr transporter with mutations among the most common causes of intellectual disability (ID) in men. Calcium-dependent release of Cr was detected after stimulation in brain slices. Cr release was reduced in SLC6A8 and AGAT mutants. Cr inhibited neocortical pyramidal neurons. SLC6A8 was necessary for Cr uptake into synaptosomes. Cr was found by us to be taken up into SVs in an ATP dependent manner. Our biochemical, chemical, genetic and electrophysiological results are consistent with the possibility of Cr as a neurotransmitter.Our novel approach to discover neurotransmitters is to begin with analysis of contents in SVs before defining their function and physiology.",

    "abstract": "DNA sequencing data continues to progress towards longer reads with increasingly lower sequencing error rates. We focus on the critical problem of mapping, or aligning, low-divergence sequences from long reads (PacBio HiFi) to a reference genome, which poses challenges in terms of accuracy and computational resources when using cutting-edge read mapping approaches that are designed for all types of alignments. A natural idea would be to optimize efficiency with longer seeds to reduce the probability of extraneous matches; however, contiguous exact seeds quickly reach a sensitivity limit. We introduce mapquik, a novel strategy that creates accurate longer seeds by anchoring alignments through matches of k consecutively-sampled minimizers (k-min-mers) and only indexing k-min-mers that occur once in the reference genome, thereby unlocking ultra-fast mapping while retaining high sensitivity. We demonstrate that mapquik significantly accelerates the seeding and chaining steps -- fundamental bottlenecks to read mapping -- for both the human and maize genomes with > 96% sensitivity and near-perfect specificity. On the human genome, mapquik achieves a 30x speed-up over the state-of-the-art tool minimap2, and on the maize genome, a 350x speed-up over minimap2, making mapquik the fastest mapper to date. These accelerations are enabled not only by minimizer-space seeding but also a novel heuristic [O](n) pseudo-chaining algorithm, which improves over the long-standing [O](n log n) bound. Minimizer-space computation builds the foundation for achieving real-time analysis of long-read sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "The role of oxytocin (OT) in social behavior and social brain networks has been widely documented. However, the effect of OT on the association between social behavior and brain functional connectivity (FC) is yet to be comprehensively explored. In this study, using a face-perception task and multiple connectome-based predictive (CPM) models, we aimed to: 1) determine whether OT could enhance the association between task behavioral performance, resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), and task-state functional connectivity (tsFC), and 2) if so, determine the role of OT in enhancing this triangular association. We found that both rsFC and tsFC could independently and significantly predict task performance in the OT group, but not in the placebo (PL) group. In addition, the correlation coefficient between rsFC and tsFC was substantially higher in the OT group than in the PL group. The strength of these associations could be partly explained by OT altering the brains FCs related to social cognition and face-perception in both resting and task states, mainly in brain regions such as the limbic system, prefrontal cortex (PFC), temporal poles (TP), and temporoparietal junction (TPJ). Together, these results suggest that neuropeptides can increase the consistency of individual differences in different modalities (e.g., behavioral and brain level data).",

While clustering methods are used to identify functional groups within molecular interaction networks, these methods largely focus on edge density and do not explicitly take into consideration higher-order interactions. Disease genes in these networks have been shown to exhibit rich higher-order structure in their vicinity, and considering these higher-order interaction patterns in network clustering have the potential to reveal new disease-associated modules.\n\nResultsWe propose a higher-order community detection method which identifies community structure in networks with respect to specific higher-order connectivity patterns beyond edges. Higher-order community detection on four different protein-protein interaction networks identifies biologically significant modules and disease modules that conventional edge-based clustering methods fail to discover. Higher-order clusters also identify disease modules from GWAS data, including new modules that were not discovered by top-performing approaches in a Disease Module DREAM Challenge.

Most studies, however, offer blood from the same vertebrate host species as the original challenge (for e.g., human for primary and additional blood meals). Here, we show a second blood meal from bovine and canine hosts can also enhance sporozoite migration in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with the human- and rodent-restricted Plasmodium falciparum and P. berghei respectively. The extrinsic incubation period (time to sporozoite appearance in salivary glands) showed more consistent reductions with blood from human and bovine donors than canine blood, although the latters effect may be confounded by the toxicity, albeit non-specific, associated with the anticoagulant used to collect whole blood from donors. The complex patterns of enhancement highlight the limitations of a laboratory system but are nonetheless reminiscent of parasite host-specificity and mosquito adaptations, and the genetic predisposition of An. stephensi for bovine blood. We suggest that in natural settings, a blood meal from any vertebrate host could accentuate the risk of human infections by P. falciparum, although our observations should also be applicable to other species of Plasmodium and indeed other vector-borne diseases such as arboviruses for instance.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=185 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/521872v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10ec4d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9d0d21org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c92628org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e83587_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LIPlasmodium falciparum and P. berghei cause malaria in humans and rodents, respectively.\nC_LIO_LIThey are vectored by Anopheles species that can also imbibe blood from other vertebrate species.\nC_LIO_LIParasite development is enhanced after another blood meal, usually from the same host (e.g., human).\nC_LIO_LIHere, bovine, and canine blood also enhanced development of Plasmodium species in An. stephensi.\nC_LIO_LIIn natural settings, blood from any host could enhance development of vector transmitted parasites.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How closely related species co-exist, especially under conditions of resource limitation remains an intriguing problem in ecology. Having to share space and resources, such species are expected to have evolved a variety of behavioural mechanisms to reduce competition. Understanding such adaptation could also provide clues to designing effective conservation strategies for these species. In this chapter, I examine the niche partitioning and co-existence of three congeneric species, the rhesus macaque Macaca mulatta, northern pig-tailed macaque Macaca leonina and stump-tailed macaque Macaca arctoides, in a fragment of less than 20 km2, the Hollongapar Gibbon Sanctuary, which still harbours a significant proportion of original species pool. An intensive observational study was conducted on two troops each of the three species over a period of 23 months from March 2008 to January 2010. We examined niche partitioning among the macaques along two major axes--space and food. Our results found significant interspecific differences among macaques in their utilisation of both horizontal and vertical space, as well as in their utilisation of food resources. The differential utilisation of space and food has enabled the continued co-existence of the three macaque species in this fragment. At the fragment level and over proximate time scales, our results explain why primates, particularly the three species of macaques, are able to thrive even after being isolated for over one hundred years. Ecological and behavioural insights gleaned from this fragment will help us understand and promote the co-existence of primates in other habitat fragments of the Upper Brahmaputra Valley.",

    "abstract": "The collapse of the coral-dinoflagellate relationship under stress, as, for example, induced by increasing sea surface temperatures due to climate change, leads to coral bleaching and coral mortality. While symbiont shuffling or community shifting has been put forth as a rapid adaptive mechanism in corals, reported instances of these phenomena typically focus on environmental extremes rather than natural seasonal increases in sea surface temperatures that may lead to thermal stress, requiring regulation and acclimation of endosymbiotic Symbiodiniaceae. Understanding the dynamic nature of Symbiodiniaceae endosymbiont community responses to seasonal environmental fluctuations is necessary to help predict the limits of acclimation and adaptation potential. We used a combination of flow cytometry, 3D scanning, and ITS2 DNA metabarcoding to quantify Acropora pulchra Symbiodiniaceae community assemblage composition and function in situ in Guam (Micronesia). Samples were collected during the onset of seasonal warming and the time of year during which corals experience the highest sea water temperatures. Flow cytometry allowed us to expediently generate physiological profiles for thousands of individual endosymbiont cells using their autofluorescent signatures. Under variable environmental conditions, Symbiodiniaceae assemblages displayed site and season-specific photophysiological acclimation signatures while community composition and cell densities in host tissues remained homogeneous across sites. Variable photoacclimation patterns during the early season was followed by an island-wide convergence of photophysiological acclimation signatures during the season that sees the highest water temperatures in Guam. Our results show that photoacclimation rather than symbiont community assemblage reorganization allows for acclimation of Acropora pulchra to seasonal extremes in water temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the temporal dynamics of gene expression is crucial for developmental biology, tumor biology, and biogerontology. However, some timepoints remain challenging to measure in the lab, particularly during very early or very late stages of a biological process. Here we propose Sagittarius, a transformer-based model that can accurately simulate gene expression profiles at timepoints outside of the range of times measured in the lab. The key idea behind Sagittarius is to learn a shared reference space for time series measurements, thereby explicitly modeling unaligned timepoints and conditional batch effects between time series, and making the model widely applicable to diverse biological settings. We show Sagittariuss promising performance when extrapolating mammalian developmental gene expression, simulating drug-induced expression at unmeasured dose and treatment times, and augmenting datasets to accurately predict drug sensitivity. We also used Sagittarius to extrapolate mutation profiles for early-stage cancer patients, which enabled us to discover a gene set connected to the Hedgehog signaling pathway that may be related to tumorigenesis in sarcoma patients, including PTCH1, ARID2, and MYCBP2. By augmenting experimental temporal datasets with crucial but difficult-to-measure extrapolated datapoints, Sagittarius enables deeper insights into the temporal dynamics of heterogeneous transcriptomic processes and can be broadly applied to biological time series extrapolation.",

    "abstract": "The SLAPTAG is a novel molecular TAG derived from a protein domain present in the sequence of Lactobacillus acidophilus SlpA (SlpA284-444). Proteins from different biological sources, with different molecular weights or biochemical functions, can be fused in frame to the SLAPTAG and efficiently purified by the specific binding to a bacterial-derived chromatographic matrix named here Bio-Matrix (BM). Different binding and elution conditions were evaluated to set an optimized protocol for the SLAPTAG-based affinity chromatography (SAC). The binding equilibrium between SLAPTAG and BM was reached after a few minutes at 4{degrees}C, being the apparent dissociation constant (KD) of 4.3 {micro}M, a value which is similar to different Kd determined for other S-layer proteins and their respective bacterial cell walls. A reporter protein was generated (H6-GFP-SLAPTAG) to compare the efficiency of the SAC against a commercial system based on a Ni2+-charged agarose matrix, observing no differences in the H6-GFP-SLAPTAG purification performance. The stability and reusability of the BM were evaluated, and it was determined that the matrix was stable for more than a year, being possible to reuse it five times without a significant loss in the efficiency for protein purification. Alternatively, we explored the recovery of bound SLAP-tagged proteins by proteolysis using the SLAPASE (a SLAP-tagged version of the HRV-3c protease) that released a tag-less GFP (SLAPTAG-less). Additionally, iron nanoparticles were linked to the BM and the resulting BMmag was successfully adapted for a magnetic SAC, a technique that can be potentially applied for high-throughput-out protein production and purification.",

    "abstract": "Retention time (RT) alignment is one of the crucial steps in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomic and metabolomic experiments, especially for large cohort studies, and it can be achieved using computational methods; the most popular methods are the warping function method and the direct matching method. However, the existing tools can hardly handle monotonic and non-monotonic RT shifts simultaneously. To overcome this, we developed a deep learning-based RT alignment tool, DeepRTAlign, for large cohort LC-MS data analysis. It first performs a coarse alignment by calculating the average time shift between any two samples and then uses RT and m/z as the main features to train its deep learning-based model. We demonstrate that DeepRTAlign has improved performances, especially when handling complex samples, by benchmarking it against current state-of-the-art approaches on 19 real-world proteomic and metabolomic datasets and the corresponding simulated datasets. Benchmarked on a dataset with known fold changes, the results showed that DeepRTAlign can improve the identification sensitivity of MS data without compromising the quantitative accuracy. Furthermore, using the MS features aligned by DeepRTAlign in a large cohort, we trained a classifier of 15 features to predict the early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. The features were validated on an independent cohort using targeted proteomics with an AUC of 0.833. Being flexible and robust with four different feature extraction tools, DeepRTAlign provides an advanced solution to RT alignment in large cohort LC-MS data, which is currently one of the bottlenecks in proteomics and metabolomics research, especially for clinical applications.",

In vitro cytotoxicity assays revealed that FA-Chi-NPs had no cytotoxic effect on Caco-2 cells. Acute-toxicity and subacute-toxicity of FA-Chi-NPs (0.4, 2, and 4 mg/kg body weight) revealed no mortality, and no gross morphological abnormalities were noticed. There were no dose-dependent toxic effects of free folic acid (FA) and FA-Chi-NPs in haematological, histological, plasma biochemical indices, oxidative stress enzymes, or other parameters when compared to the control group(s). The plasma and tissue levels of FA from FA-Chi-NPs were significantly higher. Results demonstrated enhanced bioavailability of FA from FA-Chi-NPs with no toxicity.\n\nPractical applicationsIn the current study, nanoencapsulation is used as a potential approach to enhance folic acid bioavailability. The results showed that encapsulating folic acid in chitosan improved bioavailability with no apparent adverse effects, and thus chitosan could be a promising polymer for safe folic acid delivery.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen concentration naturally fluctuates in aquatic environments. Due to increased eutrophication caused by anthropic activities, this phenomenon could be amplified and result in a daily cycle of alternating normoxic and hypoxic conditions. At the metabolic level, lack of oxygen and reoxygenation can both have serious repercussions on fish due to fluctuations in ATP supply and demand and an elevated risk of oxidative burst. Thus, fish must adjust their phenotype to survive and equilibrate their energetic budget. However, their energy allocation strategy could imply a reduction in growth which could be deleterious for their fitness. Although the impact of cyclic hypoxia is a major issue for ecosystems and fisheries worldwide, our knowledge remains however limited. Our objective was to characterise the effects of cyclic hypoxia on growth and metabolism in fish. We monitored growth parameters (specific growth rate, condition factor), hepatosomatic and visceral indexes, relative heart mass and hematocrit of Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus) exposed to thirty days of cyclic hypoxia. We also measured the hepatic protein synthesis rate, hepatic triglycerides as well as muscle glucose, glycogen and lactate, and quantified hepatic metabolites during this treatment. Arctic char appeared to acclimate well to oxygen fluctuations. The first days of cyclic hypoxia induced a profound metabolome reorganisation in the liver. However, fish rebalanced their metabolic activities and successfully maintained their growth and energetic reserves after one month of cyclic hypoxia. These results demonstrate the impressive ability of fish to cope with their changing environment.\n\nSummary statementThis study characterizes the metabolic adjustments performed by Arctic char when coping with one month of cyclic hypoxia. Fish reached a new phenotype by defending their growth and energy stores.",

The abundance of microbial groups along crosss-hore transects was measured based on combined flow cytometry and SSU rRNA gene metabarcoding. Our results show that most groups were depleted (up to 50%) over the hard-bottom compared to the open sea, but unexpectedly we did not observe a clear differential removal of different taxa, SAR 11 notably.

    "abstract": "Species interactions are the backbone of the structure and dynamics of communities. The extensive research into the link between structure and stability has been primarily theoretical and focused on monotrophic networks. Therefore, how the disruption of multitrophic interactions alters communities response to perturbations in nature remains an open question. Here, we explored how non-native ungulates affect pollination-seed dispersal multilayer networks in Patagonia, Argentina. Ungulates disrupt a hummingbird-mistletoe-marsupial keystone interaction, which alters community composition. We calculated interlayer connectivity, modularity, and species roles in connecting modules for intact vs. invaded networks. To link structural changes to stability, we quantified network tolerance to a single random species removal (disturbance propagation) and sequential species removal (robustness) using a stochastic coextinction model. Non-native ungulates reduced the connectivity between pollination and seed dispersal and produced fewer modules with a skewed size distribution. Moreover, species shifted their structural role, primarily from connectors to peripherals, thereby fragmenting the network by reducing the \"bridges\" among modules. These structural changes altered the dynamics of cascading effects in the community, increasing disturbance propagation and reducing network robustness. Our results highlight the importance of understanding the mechanisms that alter the structure and subsequent stability of multitrophic communities in nature.",

    "abstract": "Across the tree of life, species have repeatedly evolved similar phenotypes. While well-studied for ecological traits, there is also evidence for convergent evolution of sexually selected traits. Swordtail fish (Xiphophorus) are a classic model system for studying sexual selection, and female Xiphophorus exhibit strong mate preferences for large male body size and a range of sexually dimorphic ornaments. However, sexually selected traits have been lost multiple times in the genus. Phylogenetic relationships between species in this group have historically been controversial, likely as a result of prevalent gene flow, resulting in uncertainty over the number of losses of ornamentation and large body size. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing approaches to re-examine phylogenetic relationships within a Xiphophorus clade that varies in the presence and absence of sexually selected traits. Using wild-caught individuals, we determine the phylogenetic placement of a small, unornamented species, X. continens, confirming an additional loss of ornamentation and large body size in the clade. With these revised phylogenetic relationships, we analyze evidence for coevolution between body size and other sexually selected traits using a phylogenetically independent contrasts approach. These results provide insights into the evolutionary pressures driving the recurrent loss of suites of sexually selected traits.",

    "abstract": "Salmonid rickettsial syndrome (SRS) remains as one of the most important pathogens for salmon farming. Genetic improvement has proven to be a viable alternative to reduce mortality in breeding stock. Understanding the genetic architecture of resistance has been a matter of ongoing research aimed at establishing the most appropriate method by which genomic information can be incorporated into breeding programs. However, the genetic architecture of complex traits such as SRS resistance may vary due to genetic and environmental background. In this work, we used the genotypes of a total of 5839 Atlantic salmon from 4 different experimental challenges against Piscirickttsia salmonis, which were imputed high density ([~]930K SNP) to perform within-population genomic-association analyses, followed by a meta-analysis of resistance to SRS defined as binary survival and day of death. The objectives of this study were to i) uncover the genomic regions associated with resistance to SRS among multiple populations; and ii) identify candidate genes associated with each trait definition. SNP-based meta-analysis revealed a clear QTL on Ssa02 for both traits while gene-based meta-analysis revealed 16 genes in common for both traits. Our results suggest a polygenic genetic architecture and provide novel insights into the candidate genes underpinning resistance to P. salmonis in Salmo salar.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes in the lamina region of the optic nerve head play vital roles in supporting retinal ganglion cell axon health. In glaucoma, these astrocytes are implicated as early responders to stressors, undergoing characteristic changes in cell function as well as cell morphology. Much of what is currently known about individual lamina astrocyte morphology has been learned from rodent models which lack a defining feature of the human optic nerve head, the collagenous lamina cribrosa (LC). Current methods available for evaluation of collagenous LC astrocyte morphology have significant shortcomings. We aimed to evaluate Multicolor DiOlistic labeling (MuDi) as an approach to reveal individual astrocyte morphologies across the collagenous LC.\n\nGold microcarriers were coated with all combinations of three fluorescent cell membrane dyes, DiI, DiD, and DiO, for a total of seven dye combinations. Microcarriers were delivered to 150m-thick coronal vibratome slices through the LC of pig, sheep, goat, and monkey eyes via MuDi. Labeled tissues were imaged with confocal and second harmonic generation microscopy to visualize dyed cells and LC collagenous beams, respectively. GFAP labeling of DiOlistically-labeled cells with astrocyte morphologies was used to investigate cell identity. 3D models of astrocytes were created from confocal image stacks for quantification of morphological features.\n\nDiOlistic labeling revealed fine details of LC astrocyte morphologies including somas, primary branches, higher-order branches, and end-feet. Labeled cells with astrocyte morphologies were GFAP+. Astrocytes were visible across seven distinct color channels, allowing high labeling density while still distinguishing individual cells from their neighbors. MuDi was capable of revealing tens to hundreds of collagenous LC astrocytes, in situ, with a single application. 3D astrocyte models allowed automated quantification of morphological features including branch number, length, thickness, hierarchy, and straightness as well as Sholl analysis.\n\nMuDi labeling provides an opportunity to investigate morphologies of collagenous LC astrocytes, providing both qualitative and quantitative detail, in healthy tissues. This approach may open doors for research of glaucoma, where astrocyte morphological alterations are thought to coincide with key functional changes related to disease progression.",

    "abstract": "From proteins to chromosomes, polymers fold into specific conformations that control their biological function. Polymer folding has long been studied with equilibrium thermodynamics, yet intracellular organization and regulation involve energy-consuming, active processes. Signatures of activity have been measured in the context of chromatin motion, which shows spatial correlations and enhanced subdiffusion only in the presence of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Moreover, chromatin motion varies with genomic coordinate, pointing towards a heterogeneous pattern of active processes along the sequence. How do such patterns of activity affect the conformation of a polymer such as chromatin? We address this question by combining analytical theory and simulations to study a polymer subjected to sequence-dependent correlated active forces. Our analysis shows that a local increase in activity (larger active forces) can cause the polymer backbone to bend and expand, while less active segments straighten out and condense. Our simulations further predict that modest activity differences can drive compartmentalization of the polymer consistent with the patterns observed in chromosome conformation capture experiments. Moreover, segments of the polymer that show correlated active (sub)diffusion attract each other through effective long-ranged harmonic interactions, whereas anticorrelations lead to effective repulsions. Thus, our theory offers non-equilibrium mechanisms for forming genomic compartments, which cannot be distinguished from affinity-based folding using structural data alone. As a first step toward disentangling active and passive mechanisms of folding, we discuss a data-driven approach to discern if and how active processes affect genome organization.",

    "abstract": "Nek kinases are involved in regulating several different elements of the centrosomal cycle, primary cilia function, and DNA damage responses. Unlike the other members of the Nek family, which are serine-threonine kinases, Nek10 preferentially targets tyrosines. Nek10 appears to have a broad role in DNA damage responses, regulating a MAPK-activated G2/M checkpoint following UV irradiation and influencing the p53-mediated activation induced by genotoxicity. In an attempt to identify additional Nek10 functions, we characterized the effect of Nek10 deletion in lung cancer cells, where it is relatively highly expressed. Nek10 absence led to an increase in both the signaling and adherens junctions pools of {beta}-catenin. Mechanistically, Nek10 associates with the Axin complex where it phosphorylates {beta}-catenin at Tyr30, located within the regulatory region governing {beta}-catenin turnover. In the absence of Nek10 phosphorylation, GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of {beta}-catenin, a prerequisite for its turnover, was significantly impaired. Stabilization of {beta}-catenin driven by Nek10 loss diminished the ability of cells to form tumorspheres in suspension, grow in soft agar, and colonize mouse lung tissue following tail vein injections.",

    "abstract": "A frequently repeated premise is that viruses evolve to become less pathogenic. This appears also to be true for SARS-CoV-2, although the increased level of immunity in human populations makes it difficult to distinguish between reduced intrinsic pathogenicity and increasing protective immunity. The reduced pathogenicity of the omicron BA.1 sub-lineage compared to earlier variants is well described and appears to be due to reduced utilization of TMPRRS2. That this reduced pathogenicity remains true for omicron BA.5 was recently reported. In sharp contrast, we show that a BA.5 isolate was significantly more pathogenic in K18-hACE2 mice than a BA.1 isolate, with BA.5 infection showing increased neurovirulence, encephalitis and mortality, similar to that seen for an original ancestral isolate. BA.5 also infected human cortical brain organoids to a greater extent than a BA.1 and original ancestral isolate. Neurons were the target of infection, with increasing evidence of neuron infection in COVID-19 patients. These results argue that while omicron virus may be associated with reduced respiratory symptoms, BA.5 shows increased neurovirulence compared to earlier omicron sub-variants.",

    "abstract": "Norovirus is a highly diverse RNA virus often implicated in food-borne outbreaks, particularly shellfish. Shellfish are filter feeders, and when harvested in bays exposed to wastewater overflow or storm overflows, they can harbour various pathogens, including human pathogenic viruses. The application of Sanger or amplicon-based High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) technologies to identify human pathogens in shellfish faces two main challenges i) distinguishing multiple genotypes/variants in a single sample and ii) low concentrations of norovirus RNA. Here we have assessed the performance of a novel norovirus capsid amplicon HTS method. We generated a panel of spiked oysters containing various norovirus concentrations with different genotypic compositions. Several DNA polymerase and Reverse Transcriptase (RT) enzymes were compared, and performance was evaluated based on i) the number of reads passing quality filters per sample, ii) the number of correct genotypes identified, and iii) the sequence identity of outputs compared to Sanger-derived sequences. A combination of the reverse transcriptase LunaScript and the DNA polymerase AmpliTaq Gold provided the best results. The method was then employed, and compared with Sanger sequencing, to characterise norovirus populations in naturally contaminated oysters.\n\nImportanceWhile foodborne outbreaks account for approximately 14% of norovirus cases (Verhoef L, Hewitt J, Barclay L, Ahmed S, Lake R, Hall AJ, Lopman B, Kroneman A, Vennema H, Vinje J, Koopmans M. 2015. 1999-2012. Emerg Infect Dis 21:592-599), we do not have standardised high-throughput sequencing methods for genotypic characterisation in foodstuffs. Here we present an optimised amplicon high- throughput sequencing method for the genotypic characterisation of norovirus in oysters. This method can accurately detect and characterise norovirus at concentrations typically detected in oysters. It will permit the investigation of norovirus genetic diversity in complex matrices and contribute to ongoing surveillance of norovirus in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Comorbid proteinopathies are observed in many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease (AD), increase with age, and influence clinical outcomes, yet the mechanisms remain ill-defined. Here, we show that reduction of progranulin (PGRN), a lysosomal protein associated with TDP-43 proteinopathy, also increases tau inclusions, causes concomitant accumulation of -synuclein and worsens mortality and disinhibited behaviors in tauopathy mice. The increased inclusions paradoxically protect against spatial memory deficit and hippocampal neurodegeneration. PGRN reduction with tau pathology attenuates activity of {beta}-glucocerebrosidase (GCase), a protein previously associated with synucleinopathy, while increasing glucosylceramide (GlcCer)-positive tau inclusions. In neuronal culture, GCase inhibition enhances tau aggregation induced by AD-tau. Furthermore, purified GlcCer directly promotes tau aggregation in vitro. Neurofibrillary tangles in human tauopathies are also GlcCer-immunoreactive. Thus, in addition to TDP-43, PGRN regulates tau- and synucleinopathies via GCase and GlcCer. A lysosomal PGRN-GCase pathway may be a common therapeutic target for age-related comorbid proteinopathies.",

    "abstract": "RNA-targeting small molecule therapeutics an emerging field hindered by an incomplete understanding of the basic principles governing RNA-ligand interactions. One way to advance our knowledge in this area is to study model systems where these interactions are better understood, such as riboswitches. Riboswitches bind a wide array of small molecules with high affinity and selectivity, providing a wealth of information on how RNA recognizes ligands through diverse structures. The cobalamin-sensing riboswitch is a particularly useful model system as similar sequences show highly specialized binding preferences for different biological forms of cobalamin. This riboswitch is also widely dispersed across bacteria and therefore holds strong potential as an antibiotic target. Many synthetic cobalamin forms have been developed for various purposes including therapeutics, but their interaction with cobalamin riboswitches is yet to be explored. In this study, we characterize the interactions of eleven cobalamin derivatives with three representative cobalamin riboswitches using in vitro binding experiments (both chemical footprinting and a fluorescence-based assay) and a cell-based reporter assay. The derivatives show productive interactions with two of the three riboswitches, demonstrating simultaneously plasticity and selectivity within these RNAs. The observed plasticity is partially achieved through a novel structural rearrangement within the ligand binding pocket, providing insight into how similar RNA structures can be targeted in the future. As the derivatives also show in vivo functionality, they serve as several potential lead compounds for further drug development.",

    "abstract": "Candida boidinii NAD+-dependent formate dehydrogenase (CbFDH) has gained significant attention for its potential applications in the production of biofuels and various industrial chemicals from inorganic carbon dioxide. In this study, we present an atomic X-ray crystal structure of the apo CbFDH to 1.4 [A] resolution determined at cryogenic temperature at the Turkish Light Source, \"Turkish DeLight\". This structure offers a comprehensive view of the apo enzymes dynamics, filling the gaps in our understanding from previous studies. Also, comparison of our high-resolution apo and previously available holo enzyme structures reveals major conformational changes of this dynamic enzyme in the absence and presence of the coenzyme and substrate/inhibitor complexes. Collectively all these information may provide invaluable insights into future protein engineering efforts that could enhance enzymatic activity and stability, potentially increasing its efficiency and effectiveness of CbFDH in industrial processes.",

    "abstract": "Coordination and cooperation are hallmarks of the behavior of social animals. Coordination requires common choices to obtain maximum benefit, whereas cooperation requires to forgo immediate selfish outcome for later common maximum benefit. A well validated economic game for investigating cooperation is Prisoner Dilemma (PD). Recent studies show that monkeys cooperate to a limited extent when playing an iterated PD. In our experiment, macaque monkeys made choices on a touchscreen to obtain juice reward whose amount depended on the choices of both animals. We designed four coordination games and two cooperation games (iterated PD) that differed only in a single payoff (the so-called temptation) while all other payoffs remained constant. The increasing temptation payoff resulted in performance that varied somewhat in the coordination game (probability of common choice between p = 0.55 and p = 0.70) but dropped in both cooperation games while nevertheless remaining significant (p = 0.28 to p = 0.68). The response time of the second player increased significantly when the first player chose the cooperative option across all games, suggesting reciprocation; further, the animals seemed to benefit from seeing the action of the other player, indicating that the choices incorporated a social component. Taken together, our results demonstrate good cooperation in the iterated PD by macaque monkeys after being primed with coordination games.",

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging data is complex and high-dimensional that poses challenges for machine learning (ML) applications. Of varieties of reasons contributing on accuracy decoding, variable feature selection is one of crucial steps for determining target feature in data analysis, especially in the context of neuroimaging studies where the number of features is often much larger than the number of observations. Therefore, optimization of feature selection from such high-dimensional neuroimaging data has been challenging using conventional ML algorithms. Here, we introduce an efficient ML package incorporating a forward variable selection (FVS) algorithm that optimizes the identification of features for both classification and regression models. In our framework, the best ML model and feature pairs that explain the inputs can be automatically determined. Moreover, the toolbox can be executed in a parallel environment for efficient computation. The parallelized FVS algorithm iteratively selects the best feature pair compared against the previous steps to maximize the predictive performance. The FVS algorithm evaluates the goodness-of-fit across different models using the k-fold cross validation and identifies the best subset of features based on a pre-defined criterion for each model. Furthermore, the hyperparameters of each ML model are optimized at each forward iteration. A final outcome highlights an optimized number of selected features (brain regions of interest) with decoding accuracies. Using our pipeline, we examined the effectiveness of our toolbox on an existing neuroimaging (structural MRI) dataset. Compared ML models with and without FVS approach, we demonstrate that the FVS significantly improved the accuracy of the ML algorithm over the counterpart model without FVS. Furthermore, we confirmed the use of parallel computation considerably reduced the computational burden for the high-dimensional MRI data. This oFVSD toolbox efficiently and effectively improves the performance of both classification and regression models on neuroimaging data and should be applicable to many other neuroimaging data and more. This Python package is open-source and freely available, making it a useful toolbox for neuroimaging communities seeking improvement of decoding accuracy for their datasets.",

    "abstract": "Spatial features of connections, such as topography and divergence/convergence, reflect the information-processing mechanisms crucial for understanding and modeling the brain. However, this has not yet been comprehensively investigated. Using diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) data, we developed a topographic factor (TF) and divergence/convergence factor (DC) to quantitatively explore the spatial connectivity patterns of one entire hemisphere of the human cerebral cortex. In the analysis, the early sensory areas, which are located far away from the center of the cerebral cortex, exhibited high topographic connectivity. In contrast, the limbic system, which is located proximal to the center, showed high divergence/convergence in two types of connectivity: one region to another region at the region-to-region level, and one region to all other regions at the global level. Topography had anti-correlation with divergence/convergence over the cerebral cortex, and the two types of divergence/convergence displayed positive correlation with each other. These results suggest that topographic and divergent/convergent connectivity are spatially organized with respect to cytoarchitecture over the cerebral cortex to optimize energy efficiency and information transfer performance in the cerebral cortex.",

    "abstract": "Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipoprotein, two essential components of the outer membrane (OM) in Gram-negative bacteria, play critical roles in bacterial physiology and pathogenicity. LPS translocation to the OM is mediated by LptDE, yet how lipoproteins sort to the cell surface remains elusive. Here we report the identification of an inventory of lipoproteins that are transported to the cell surface via LptDE. Notably, we determined crystal structures of LptDE from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and its complex with an endogenous Escherichia coli lipoprotein YifL. The paLptDE-YifL structure demonstrates that YifL translocates to the OM via LptDE, in a manner similar to LPS transport. The {beta}-barrel domain serves as a passage for the proteinaceous moiety while its acyl chains are transported outside. Our finding has been corroborated by results from native mass spectrometry, immunofluorescence, and photocrosslinking assays, revealing a unique mechanism through which lipoproteins are translocated across the OM in an ATP- and LPS-dependent manner. Moreover, our study expands the scope of current knowledge of lipoprotein sorting by disclosing a crosstalk between the Lpt and Lol pathways.",

    "abstract": "Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam) is the worlds seventh most important food crop by production quantity. Cultivated sweetpotato is a hexaploid (2n = 6x = 90), and its genome (B1B1B2B2B2B2) is quite complex due to polyploidy, self-incompatibility, and high heterozygosity. Here we established a haploid-resolved and chromosome-scale de novo assembly of autohexaploid sweetpotato genome sequences. Before constructing the genome, we created chromosome-scale genome sequences in I. trifida using a highly homozygous accession, Mx23Hm, with PacBio RSII and Hi-C reads. Haploid-resolved genome assembly was performed for a sweetpotato cultivar, Xushu18 by hybrid assembly with Illumina paired-end (PE) and mate-pair (MP) reads, 10X genomics reads, and PacBio RSII reads. Then, 90 chromosome-scale pseudomolecules were generated by aligning the scaffolds onto a sweetpotato linkage map. De novo assemblies were also performed for chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes in I. trifida and sweetpotato. In total, 34,386 and 175,633 genes were identified on the assembled nucleic genomes of I. trifida and sweetpotato, respectively. Functional gene annotation and RNA-Seq analysis revealed locations of starch, anthocyanin, and carotenoid pathway genes on the sweetpotato genome. This is the first report of chromosome-scale de novo assembly of the sweetpotato genome. The results are expected to contribute to genomic and genetic analyses of sweetpotato.",
