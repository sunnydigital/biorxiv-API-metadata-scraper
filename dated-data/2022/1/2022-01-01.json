    "abstract": "BackgroundOtotoxic chemicals can impair the senses of hearing and balance in mammals through irreversible damage to the mechanosensory bundles of inner ear hair cells. Fish and amphibians are useful models for investigating ototoxicity because their inner ear hair cells, like those of mammals, are susceptible to damage by ototoxins. Moreover, amphibian mechanosensation is augmented by a lateral line organ on the body surface that comprises external mechanosensory hair cells. The lateral line hair cells are arranged in clusters (neuromasts) and are structurally and functionally similar to inner ear hair cells, but are more accessible for experimental manipulation. Herein, we implemented neuromasts of the amphibian (Xenopus) lateral line as an organ system for evaluating the effects of ototoxic chemicals, such as antibiotics, on mechanosensory hair cell bundles.\n\nMethodsWe examined the ultrastructure of larval Xenopus laevis neuromasts with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) after larvae were continuously exposed to ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations (gentamicin; streptomycin; neomycin) for 72 hours.\n\nResultsSEM images demonstrated that 72 hours of exposure to antibiotic concentrations greater than 25 {micro}M reduced the hair cell bundle number in lateral line neuromasts.\n\nConclusionTherapeutic drug studies will benefit from the incorporation of bioassay strategies that evaluate ototoxicity across multiple species including genera of amphibian origin such as Xenopus. Our outcomes support the use of the Xenopus lateral line for identification of potential ototoxic chemicals and suggest that Xenopus neuromast hair cell bundles can withstand antibiotic exposure. The Xenopus bioassay presented here can be incorporated into drug discovery methodology as a high-resolution phenotypic screen for ototoxic effects.\n\nSummary statementDamage to sensory cells of the inner ear by chemical agents such as antibiotics contributes to the growing global prevalence of disorders of hearing and balance. Our results demonstrate that the Xenopus lateral line, in conjunction with SEM, affords an accessible organ system for otoxicity screens during the drug discovery pipeline.",

    "abstract": "To identify conserved components of synapse function that are also associated with human diseases, we conducted a genetic screen. We used the Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) as a model. We employed RNA interference (RNAi) on selected targets and assayed synapse function and plasticity by electrophysiology. We focused our screen on genetic factors known to be conserved from human neurological or muscle functions (300 Drosophila lines screened). From our screen, knockdown of a Mitochondrial Complex I (MCI) subunit gene (ND-20L) lowered levels of NMJ neurotransmission. Due to the severity of the phenotype, we studied MCI function further. Knockdown of core MCI subunits concurrently in neurons and muscle led to impaired neurotransmission. We localized this neurotransmission function to the muscle. Pharmacology targeting MCI phenocopied the impaired neurotransmission phenotype. Finally, MCI subunit knockdowns or pharmacological inhibition led to profound cytological defects, including reduced NMJ growth and altered NMJ morphology. Mitochondria are essential for cellular bioenergetics and produce ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Five multi-protein complexes achieve this task, and MCI is the largest. Impaired Mitochondrial Complex I subunits in humans are associated with disorders such as Parkinsons disease, Leigh syndrome, and cardiomyopathy. Together, our data present an analysis of Complex I in the context of synapse function and plasticity. We speculate that in the context of human MCI dysfunction, similar neuronal and synaptic defects could contribute to pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Dihydroquinine (DHQ), is a quinine-based compound with anti-malarial properties. However, little is known about its mechanism of action against T. gondii inhibition, which shares similar biology with Plasmodium spp. In order to explore DHQ activity as an inhibitor of T. gondii using in vitro assays, we first used an in silico approach to decipher its mechanisms of action based on previous knowledge about its disruption of nucleic acid and protein synthesis. An in silico study was performed on T. gondii parasite replication, transcriptional and translational machinery to decipher the binding potentials of DHQ to some top selected enzymes. We report for the first time, using an in silico analysis that showed that DHQ binds strongly to DNA gyrase, Calcium Dependent Protein Kinase 1 (CDPK 1), and prolyl tRNA synthetase and thus could affect DNA replication, transcriptional and translational activities in T. gondii. Also, we found DHQ to effectively bind to mitochondria detoxifying enzymes (i.e., superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidoxin, and Catalase (CAT)). In conclusion, DHQ could be a lead compound for the treatment of toxoplasmosis when successfully evaluated using in vitro and in vivo models to confirm its effectiveness and safety.",

Here we combine gut microbiota manipulation with automated behavioral tracking of honeybee sub-colonies to show that the microbiota increases the rate and specialization of social interactions. Microbiota colonization was associated with higher abundances of one third of metabolites detected in the brain, including several amino acids, and a subset of these metabolites were significant predictors of social interactions. Colonization also affected brain transcriptional processes related to amino acid metabolism and epigenetic modification in a brain region involved in sensory perception. These results demonstrate that the gut microbiota modulates the emergent colony social network of honeybees, likely via changes in chromatin accessibility and amino acid biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThere is mounting evidence that microbes resident in the human intestine contribute to diverse alcohol-associated liver diseases (ALD) including the most deadly form known as alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH). However, mechanisms by which gut microbes synergize with excessive alcohol intake to promote liver injury are poorly understood. Furthermore, whether drugs that selectively target gut microbial metabolism can improve ALD has never been tested.\n\nMETHODSWe used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry to quantify the levels of microbe and host choline co-metabolites in healthy controls and AH patients, finding elevated levels of the microbial metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) in AH. In subsequent studies, we treated mice with non-lethal bacterial choline TMA lyase (CutC/D) inhibitors to blunt gut microbe-dependent production of TMA in the context of chronic ethanol administration. Indices of liver injury were quantified by complementary RNA sequencing, biochemical, and histological approaches. In addition, we examined the impact of ethanol consumption and TMA lyase inhibition on gut microbiome structure via 16S rRNA sequencing.\n\nRESULTSWe show the gut microbial choline metabolite trimethylamine (TMA) is elevated in AH patients and correlates with reduced hepatic expression of the TMA oxygenase flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO3). Provocatively, we find that small molecule inhibition of gut microbial CutC/D activity protects mice from ethanol-induced liver injury. CutC/D inhibitor-driven improvement in ethanol-induced liver injury is associated with distinct reorganization of the gut microbiome and host liver transcriptome.\n\nCONCLUSIONSThe microbial metabolite TMA is elevated in patients with AH, and inhibition of TMA production from gut microbes can protect mice from ethanol-induced liver injury.",

We showed that folic acid-modified triangular DNA origami nanostructures (FA-tDONs) could reduce ROS and NO simultaneously inside proinflammatory M1 macrophages, leading to their polarization into anti-inflammatory M2 subtype. Further in vivo studies confirmed that FA-tDONs could actively target inflamed joints in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, attenuate inflammatory cytokines and alleviate disease progression. This work demonstrated that DNA origami itself could act as a potential nanomedicine for targeted RA treatment.",

Here, using predicted structural models as a guide, we probed the effects of twelve mutations on the mechanical gating of the transduction currents in native hair cells of Tmc1/2-null mice expressing virally introduced TMC1 variants. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings revealed that mutations within the pore-lining transmembrane (TM) helices 4 and 6 modified gating, reducing the force sensitivity or shifting the open probability of the channels, or both. For some of the mutants, these changes were accompanied by a change in single-channel conductance. Our observations are in line with a model wherein conformational changes in the TM4 and TM6 helices are involved in the mechanical gating of the transduction channel.",

We have identified an intermediate cellular event during pancreatic carcinogenesis in the KPC mouse model of PDA that is represented by a subpopulation of tumor cells that express KrasG12D, p53R172H and one allele of wild-type Trp53. In vivo, these cells represent a histological spectrum of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and rarely proliferate. Following loss of wild-type p53, these precursor lesions undergo malignant de-differentiation and acquire invasive features. We have established matched organoid cultures of pre-invasive and invasive cells from murine PDA. Expression profiling of the organoids led to the identification of markers of the pre-invasive cancer cells in vivo and mechanisms of disease aggressiveness.",

    "abstract": "Mosasaurid squamates were the dominant amniote predators in marine ecosystems during most of the Late Cretaceous. Evidence from multiple sites worldwide of a global mosasaurid community restructuring across the Campanian-Maastrichtian transition may have wide-ranging implications for the evolution of diversity of these top oceanic predators. In this study, we use a suite of biomechanical traits and functionally descriptive ratios to investigate how the morphofunctional disparity of mosasaurids evolved through time and space prior to the Cretaceous-Palaeogene (K/Pg) mass extinction. Our results suggest that the worldwide taxonomic turnover in mosasaurid community composition from Campanian to Maastrichtian is reflected by a notable increase in morphofunctional disparity on a global scale, but especially driven the North American record. Ecomorphospace occupation becomes more polarised during the late Maastrichtian, as the morphofunctional disparity of mosasaurids plateaus in the Southern Hemisphere and decreases in the Northern Hemisphere. We show that these changes are not associated with strong modifications in mosasaurid size, but rather with the functional capacities of their skulls, and that mosasaurid morphofunctional disparity was in decline in several provincial communities before the K-Pg mass extinction. Our study highlights region-specific patterns of disparity evolution, and the importance of assessing vertebrate extinctions both globally and regionally. Ecomorphological differentiation in mosasaurid communities, coupled with declines in other formerly abundant marine reptile groups, indicates widespread restructuring of higher trophic levels in marine food webs was well underway when the K-Pg mass extinction took place.",

    "abstract": "Exchange of molecules between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain cells contributes to brain function and protection from dementia. Despite widespread acceptance of the  glymphatic theory, the route by which CSF is brought close enough to the neural tissue for solutes to be exchanged by extracellular diffusion is not entirely clear. Exogenous molecules injected into CSF are observed to reach the basement lamina that surrounds the dense capillary network. Transport of solutes by diffusion along the basement lamina, a gel of macromolcules about 100 nm thick, would be too slow; bulk flow in a static geometry would require unphysiologically high pressures. However, it is known that the pulsation of blood aids transport of CSF, and we hypothesized that this is because the pulsation intermittently squeezes the pericapillary lamina. In a primitive mimicry, we have tested whether intermittent squeezing increases flow through an agar gel. In all but one of 216 tests, pulsation caused a reversible increase, sometimes by a factor of 100 or more. The enhancement was greatest for frequencies 5-11 Hz and, over the tested range of pressure heads (20 - 50 cmH2O), was greatest for the lowest pressure. The results suggest a reason why exercise slows the aging of the brain.",

    "abstract": "White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a typical feature of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). This condition contributes to about 50% of dementias worldwide, a massive health burden in aging. Microstructural alterations in the deep white matter (DWM) have been widely examined in CSVD. However, little is known about abnormalities in the superficial white matter (SWM) and their relevance for processing speed, the main cognitive deficit in CSVD. In this paper, 141 patients with CSVD were studied. Processing speed was assessed by the completion time of the Trail Making Test Part A. White matter abnormalities were assessed by WMH burden (lesion volume on T2-FLAIR) and diffusion MRI, including DTI and free-water (FW) imaging microstructure measures. The results of our study indicate that the superficial white matter may play a particularly important role in cognitive decline in CSVD. SWM imaging measures resulted in a large contribution to processing speed, despite a relatively small WMH burden in the SWM. SWM FW had the strongest association with processing speed among all imaging markers and, unlike the other diffusion MRI measures, significantly increased between two patient subgroups with the lowest WMH burdens (possibly representing early stages of disease). When comparing two patient subgroups with the highest WMH burdens, the involvement of WMH in the SWM was accompanied by significant differences in processing speed and white matter microstructure. Given significant effects of WMH volume and regional FW on processing speed, we performed a mediation analysis. SWM FW was found to fully mediate the association between WMH volume and processing speed, while no mediation effect of DWM FW was observed. Overall, our findings identify SWM abnormalities in CSVD and suggest that the SWM has an important contribution to processing speed. Results indicate that FW in the SWM is a sensitive marker of microstructural changes associated with cognition in CSVD. This study extends the current understanding of CSVD-related dysfunction and suggests that the SWM, as an understudied region, can be a potential target for monitoring pathophysiological processes in future research.",

However, the synaptic mechanisms involved in persistent depression of synaptic transmission resulting in more prolonged neurological dysfunction following anesthesia are less clear. Here, we show that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a growth factor implicated in synaptic plasticity and dysfunction, enhances glutamate synaptic vesicle exocytosis, and that attenuation of vesicular BDNF release by isoflurane contributes to transient depression of excitatory synaptic transmission in mice. This reduction in synaptic vesicle exocytosis was irreversible in neurons that release less endogenous BDNF due to a polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) compared to wild-type mouse hippocampal neurons following isoflurane exposure. These effects were prevented by exogenous application of BDNF. Our findings identify a role for a common human BDNF single nucleotide polymorphism (Val66Met; rs6265) in persistent changes of synaptic function following isoflurane exposure. These persistent alterations in excitatory synaptic transmission have important implications for the role of genotype in anesthetic effects on synaptic plasticity and neurocognitive function.",

We found that motor neurons derived from the affected twin exhibited increased transcript levels of all three neurofilament isoforms and increased expression of phosphorylated neurofilament puncta. We further found that treatment of the motor neurons with astrocyte conditioned medium and microglial conditioned medium significantly impacted neurofilament deposition.

    "abstract": "The basolateral amygdala (BL) is a major regulator of foraging behavior. Following BL inactivation, rats become indifferent to predators. However, at odds with the view that the amygdala detects threats and generate defensive behaviors, most BL neurons have reduced firing rates during foraging and at proximity of the predator. In search of the signals determining this unexpected activity pattern, this study considered the contribution of the central medial thalamic nucleus (CMT), which sends a strong projection to BL, mostly targeting its principal neurons. Inactivation of CMT or BL with muscimol abolished the rats normally cautious behavior in the foraging task. Moreover, unit recordings revealed that CMT neurons showed large but heterogeneous activity changes during the foraging task, with many neurons decreasing or increasing their discharge rates, with a modest bias for the latter. A generalized linear model revealed that CMT neurons encode many of the same task variables as principal BL cells. However, the nature (inhibitory vs. excitatory) and relative magnitude of the activity modulations seen in CMT neurons differed markedly from those of principal BL cells but were very similar to those of fast-spiking BL interneurons. Together, these findings suggest that, during the foraging task, CMT inputs fire some principal BL neurons, recruiting feedback interneurons in BL, resulting in the widespread inhibition of principal BL cells.",

    "abstract": "Vestibular efferent neurons play an important role in shaping vestibular afferent excitability and, accordingly, on the information encoded by their spike patterns. Efferent- modulation is linked to muscarinic signaling cascades that affect ion channel conductances, most notably low-voltage gated potassium channels such as KCNQ. Here we tested and found that muscarinic signaling cascades also modulate hyperpolarization- activated cyclic-nucleotide gated channels (HCN). HCN channels play a key role in controlling spike-timing regularity and a non-chemical form of transmission between type I hair cells and vestibular afferents. The impact of cholinergic efferent input on HCN channels was assessed using voltage-clamp methods, which measure currents in the disassociated cell bodies of vestibular ganglion neurons (VGN). Membrane properties in VGN were characterized before and after administration of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) agonist oxotremorine-M (Oxo-M). We found that Oxo-M shifted the voltage-activation range of HCN channels in the positive direction by 3.2 {+/-} 0.7 mV, which more than doubled the available current when held near rest at -70 mV (a 139 {+/-} 43% increase, n=12). This effect was not blocked by pre-treating the cells with a KCNQ channel blocker, linopirdine, which suggests that this effect is not dependent on KCNQ currents. We also found that HCN channel properties in the baseline condition and sensitivity to mAChR activation depended on cell size and firing patterns. Large-bodied neurons with onset firing patterns had the most depolarized activation range and least sensitivity to mAChR activation. Together, our results highlight the complex and dynamic regulation of HCN channels in VGN.\n\nSignificance StatementVestibular afferents express a diverse complement of ion channels. This diversity is key to shaping their various response properties, allowing them to encode both fast and slow head movements. In vitro studies that characterized afferent diversity identified low-voltage activated potassium channels and hyperpolarization-activated cyclic- nucleotide gated (HCN) channels as crucial for shaping the timing and sensitivity of afferent responses. Afferent excitability is known to be controlled by a network of acetylcholine-releasing efferent neurons that close a type of low-voltage activated potassium channel found on the afferent neuron. Here, we show that the same efferent signaling cascade that shuts these potassium channels also enhances the activation of HCN channels by depolarizing their voltage-activation range. The size of this effect varies from cell to cell depending on the endogenous properties of the HCN channel and on cell type (as determined by discharge patterns and cell size). Simultaneously controlling two ion-channel groups gives the vestibular efferent system robust and flexible control over the excitability and timing properties vestibular afferent activity.",

    "abstract": "Neurons are characterized by elaborate tree-like dendritic structures that support local computations by integrating multiple inputs from upstream presynaptic neurons. It is less clear if simple neurons, consisting of a few or even a single neurite, may perform local computations as well. To address this question, we focused on the compact neural network of C. elegans animals for which the full wiring diagram is available, including the coordinates of individual synapses. We find that the positions of the chemical synapses along the neurites are not randomly distributed, nor can they be explained by anatomical constraints. Instead, synapses tend to form clusters, an organization that supports local compartmentalized computations. In mutually-synapsing neurons, connections of opposite polarity cluster separately, suggesting that positive and negative feedback dynamics may be implemented in discrete compartmentalized regions along neurites. In triple-neuron circuits, the non-random synaptic organization may facilitate local functional roles, such as signal integration and coordinated activation of functionally-related downstream neurons. These clustered synaptic topologies emerge as a guiding principle in the network presumably to facilitate distinct parallel functions along a single neurite, effectively increasing the computational capacity of the neural network.",

    "abstract": "Chronic stress is a major risk factor for psychiatric illnesses, including depression; however, the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby stress leads to mood disorders remain unclear. The recent FDA approval of antidepressants with novel mechanisms of action, like Zulresso(R), a synthetic neuroactive steroid analog with molecular pharmacology similar to allopregnanolone, has spurred interest in new therapeutic targets and, potentially, novel pathophysiological mechanisms for depression. Allopregnanolone acts as a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors (GABAARS), acting preferentially at {delta} subunit-containing receptors ({delta}-GABAARS). Accumulating clinical and preclinical evidence supports the antidepressant effects of exogenous administration of allopregnanolone and allopregnanolone analogs; however, the role of endogenous neurosteroids in the pathophysiology of depression remains unknown. Here, we examine whether altered neurosteroid signaling may contribute to behavioral deficits following chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) in mice. We first identified reductions in expression of {delta}-GABAARs, the predominant site of action of 5a-reduced neuroactive steroids, following CUS. Additionally, utilizing LC-MS/MS we discovered a decrease in levels of allopregnanolone in the BLA, but not plasma of mice following CUS, an indication of impaired neurosteroid synthesis. CRISPR knockdown the rate-limiting enzymes involved in allopregnanolone synthesis, 5-reductase type 1 and 2, in the BLA mimicked the behavioral deficits associated with CUS in mice. Furthermore, overexpression expression of 5-reductase type 1 and 2 in the BLA improved behavioral outcomes. Collectively, this suggests chronic stress impairs endogenous neurosteroid signaling in the BLA which is sufficient to induce behavioral deficits similar to those observed following CUS. Further, these studies suggest that the therapeutic efficacy of allopregnanolone-based treatments may be due to their ability to directly target the underlying pathophysiology of mood disorders. Therefore, targeting endogenous neurosteroidogenesis may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of mood disorders.",

    "abstract": "The timing of neuronal responses is considered to be important for information transferring and communication across individual neurons. However, the sources of variabilities in the timing of neuronal responses are not well understood and sometimes over-interpreted. A systematic variability in the response latencies of the primary visual cortex has been reported in presence of drifting grating stimulus. Whereas the response latencies are systematically dependent on stimulus orientation. To understand the underlying mechanism of these systematic latencies, we recorded the neuronal response of the cat visual cortex, area 17, and simulated the response latency of V1 neurons, with two geometric models. We showed that outputs of these two models significantly predict the response latencies of the electrophysiology recording during orientation tasks. The periodic patterns created in the raster plots were dependent on the relative position of the stimulus rotation center and the receptive-field sub-regions. We argue the position of stimulus is contributing to systematic response latencies, dependent on drifting orientation. Therefore, we provide a toolbox based on our geometrical model for determining the exact location of RF sub-regions. Our result indicates that a major source of neuronal variability is the lack of fine-tuning in the task parameters. Considering the simplicity of the orientation selectivity task, we argue fine-tuning of stimulus properties is crucial for deduction of neural variability in higher-order cortical areas and understanding their neural dynamics.",

However, organoids usually lack microglia, brain-resident immune cells which are both present in the early human embryonic brain and participate in neuronal circuit development.\n\nHere, we find that microglia innately develop in unguided retinal organoid differentiation between week 3 and 4 in 2.5D culture and appear later in floating, non-pigmented, 3D-cystic compartments. We enriched for cystic structures using a low-dosed BMP4 application and performed mass spectrometry, thus defining the protein composition of microglia-containing compartments. We found that cystic compartments expressed both mesenchymal and epithelial markers with microglia enriched in the mesenchymal region. Interestingly, microglia-like cells started to express the border-associated macrophage marker CD163. The preferential localization of human microglia to a mesenchymal compartment provides insight into the behavior and migration of microglia. The model will ultimately allow detailed study of these enigmatic cells and how they enter and distribute within the human brain.",

Here, we contribute to this framework by examining how OT modulates social brain network correlations during resting and task states, using fMRI. First, we investigated network activation, followed by an analysis of the relationships between networks and individual differences. Subsequently, we evaluated the functional connectivity in both states. Finally, the relationship between networks across states was represented by the predictive power of networks in the resting state for task-evoked activities. The differences in the predicted accuracy between the subjects displayed individual variations in this relationship. Our results showed that the activity of the dorsal default mode network (DDMN) in the resting state had the largest predictive power for task-evoked activation of the precuneus network (PN) only in the OT group. The results also demonstrated that OT reduced the individual variation in PN in the prediction process. These findings suggest a distributed but modulatory effect of OT on the association between resting and task-dependent brain networks.",

    "abstract": "The fungal pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum (Hc) invades, replicates within, and destroys macrophages. To interrogate the molecular mechanisms underlying this interaction, we conducted a host-directed CRISPR-Cas9 screen and identified 361 genes that modify macrophage susceptibility to Hc infection, greatly expanding our understanding of host gene networks targeted by Hc. We identified pathways that have not been previously implicated in Hc interaction with macrophages, including the ragulator complex (involved in nutrient stress sensing), glycosylation enzymes, protein degradation machinery, mitochondrial respiration genes, solute transporters, and the ER membrane complex (EMC). The highest scoring protective hits included the complement C3a receptor (C3aR), a G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that recognizes the complement fragment C3a. Although it is known that the complement system reacts with the fungal surface, leading to opsonization and release of small peptide fragments such as C3a, a role for C3aR in macrophage susceptibility to fungi has not been elucidated. We demonstrated that whereas C3aR is dispensable for macrophage phagocytosis of bacteria and latex beads, it is critical for optimal macrophage capture of pathogenic fungi, including Hc, the ubiquitous fungal pathogen Candida albicans, and the causative agent of Valley Fever Coccidioides posadasii. We showed that C3aR localizes to the early phagosome during H. capsulatum infection where it coordinates the formation of actin-rich membrane protrusions that promote Hc capture. We also showed that the EMC promotes surface expression of C3aR, likely explaining its identification in our screen. Taken together, our results provide new insight into host processes that affect Hc-macrophage interactions and uncover a novel and specific role for C3aR in macrophage recognition of fungi.",

In this study, an India family with CTA was investigated and a novel c.336C>G variation was identified in the exon 3 of PAX9, leading to substitution of evolutionary conserved Cys with Trp at 112 amino acid position located at the functionally significant DNA binding paired domain region. Functional analysis revealed that p.Cys112Trp mutation did not prevent the nuclear localization although mutant protein had higher cytoplasmic retention.

Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate [PI(4)P] at the Golgi is required for the budding to filamentous growth transition in the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans, however the role of plasma membrane PI(4)P is unclear. We have investigated the importance of this phospholipid in C. albicans growth, stress response, and virulence by generating mutant strains with decreased levels of plasma membrane PI(4)P, via deletion of components of the PI-4-kinase complex, i.e. Efr3, Ypp1 and Stt4. The amount of plasma membrane PI(4)P in the efr3{Delta}/{Delta} and ypp1{Delta}/{Delta} mutant was [~]60% and [~]40% of the wild-type strain, respectively, whereas it was nearly undetectable in the stt4{Delta}/{Delta} mutant. All three mutants had reduced plasma membrane phosphatidylserine (PS). Although these mutants had normal yeast phase growth, they were defective in filamentous growth, exhibited defects in cell wall integrity and had an increased exposure of cell wall {beta}(1,3)-glucan, yet they induced a range of hyphal specific genes. In a mouse model of hematogenously disseminated candidiasis, fungal plasma membrane PI(4)P levels directly correlated with virulence; the efr3{Delta}/{Delta} had wild-type virulence, the ypp1{Delta}/{Delta} mutant had attenuated virulence and the stt4{Delta}/{Delta} mutant caused no lethality. In the mouse model of orpharyngeal candidiasis, only the ypp1{Delta}/{Delta} mutant had reduced virulence, indicating that plasma membrane PI(4)P is less important for proliferation in the oropharynx. Collectively, these results demonstrate that plasma membrane PI(4)P levels play a central role in filamentation, cell wall integrity and virulence in C. albicans.\n\nImportanceWhile the PI-4-kinases Pik1 and Stt4 both produce PI(4)P, the former generates PI(4)P at the Golgi and the latter at the plasma membrane and these two pools are functionally distinct. To address the importance of plasma membrane PI(4)P in Candida albicans, we have generated deletion mutants of the three putative plasma membrane PI-4-kinase complex components and quantified the levels of plasma membrane PI(4)P in each of these strains. Our work reveals that this phosphatidylinositol phosphate is specifically critical for the yeast-to-hyphal transition, cell wall integrity and virulence in a mouse systemic infection model. The significance of this work is in identifying a plasma membrane phospholipid that has an infection specific role, which is attributed to the loss of plasma membrane PI(4)P resulting in {beta}(1,3)-glucan unmasking.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional control by distal enhancers is an integral feature of gene regulation. To understand how enhancer-promoter interactions arise and assess the impact of disrupting 3D chromatin structure on gene expression, we generated an allelic series of mouse mutants that perturb the physical structure of the Sox2 locus. We show that in the epiblast and in neuronal tissues, CTCF-mediated loops are neither required for the interaction of the Sox2 promoter with distal enhancers, nor for its expression. Insertion of various combinations of CTCF motifs between Sox2 and its distal enhancers generated ectopic loops with varying degrees of insulation that directly correlated with reduced transcriptional output. Yet, even the mutants exhibiting the strongest insulation, with six CTCF motifs in divergent orientation, could not fully abolish activation by distal enhancers, and failed to disrupt implantation and neurogenesis. In contrast, cells of the anterior foregut were more susceptible to chromatin structure disruption with no detectable SOX2 expression in mutants with the strongest CTCF-mediated boundaries. These animals phenocopied loss of SOX2 in the anterior foregut, failed to separate trachea from esophagus and died perinatally. We propose that baseline transcription levels and enhancer density may influence the tissue-specific ability of distal enhancers to overcome physical barriers and maintain faithful gene expression. Our work suggests that high affinity enhancer-promoter interactions that can overcome chromosomal structural perturbations, play an essential role in maintaining phenotypic robustness.",

To examine the challenges faced by free-ranging R.aegyptiacus living at the northern edge of their distribution, we performed a retrospective analysis of [~]1500 clinical cases reported by a bat rescue NGO over 25 months, from all over Israel. All cases of injured or stranded bats were evaluated and categorized according to date, place, sex, age, and etiology of the morbidity. The analysis of the data showed an increase in all types of morbidity during the wintertime, with more than twice the number of cases in comparison with the summertime, over two consecutive years. Moreover, we found that the number of abandoned pups peaks during spring till autumn when adult morbidity is minimal. We characterize two prominent types of previously undescribed morbidity in R.aegyptiacus, one in the form of bacterial illness, and the other associated with feet deformation which affects bats in addition to major anthropogenic-related threats related to synanthropic predators. We analyze the reasons driving winter morbidity and conclude that winter weather and specifically low temperature best explains this morbidity. We hypothesize that R.aegyptiacus, a fruit-bat of tropical origin is facing major seasonal difficulties near the northern edge of its distribution, probably limiting its further spread northward.",

Although many genomes of fungi in the Ceratocystidaceae are publicly available, it is not known how the genes that encode catechol dioxygenases (CDOs), enzymes involved in the degradation of phenolic plant defence compounds, differ among members of the Ceratocystidaceae. The aim of this study was therefore to identify and characterize the genes encoding CDOs in the genomes of Ceratocystidaceae representatives. We found that genes encoding CDOs are more abundant in pathogenic necrotrophic species of the Ceratocystidaceae and less abundant in saprophytic species. The loss of the CDO genes and the associated 3-oxoadipate catabolic pathway appears to have occurred in a lineage-specific manner. Taken together, this study revealed a positive association between CDO gene copy number and fungal lifestyle in Ceratocystidaceae representatives.",

    "abstract": "Many animals rely on complex sexual signals that target multiple senses to attract mates and repel rivals. These multimodal mating displays can however also attract unintended receivers, which can be an important driver of signal complexity. Despite being taxonomically widespread, we often lack insight into how multimodal signals evolve from unimodal signals and in particular what roles unintended eavesdroppers play. Here we assess whether the physical movements of parasite defense behavior increase the complexity and attractiveness of an acoustic sexual signal in the little torrent frog (Amolops torrentis). Calling males of this species often display limb movements in order to defend against blood-sucking parasites such as frog-biting midges that eavesdrop on their acoustic signal. Through mate choice tests we show that some of these midge-evoked movements influence female preference for acoustic signals. Our data suggest that midge-induced movements may be incorporated into a sexual display, targeting both hearing and vision in the intended receiver. Females may play an important role in incorporating these multiple components because they prefer signals which combine multiple programs. Our results thus help to understand the relationship between ecological and sexual selection pressure operating on signalers and how in turn this may influence multimodal signal evolution.",

Machine learning methods have emerged recently as a powerful tool to solve this problem. State-of-the-art approaches allow prediction of transcriptional and epigenetic effects caused by non-coding mutations. However, these approaches require specific experimental data for training and can not generalize across cell types where required features were not experimentally measured. We show here that available epigenetic characteristics of human cell types are extremely sparse, limiting those approaches that rely on specific epigenetic input. We propose a new neural network architecture, DeepCT, which can learn complex interconnections of epigenetic features and infer unmeasured data from any available input. Furthermore, we show that DeepCT can learn cell type-specific properties, build biologically meaningful vector representations of cell types and utilize these representations to generate cell type-specific predictions of the effects of non-coding variations in the human genome.",

    "abstract": "Human tissue surfaces are coated with mucins, a family of macromolecular sugar-laden proteins serving diverse functions from lubrication to formation of selective biochemical barriers against harmful microorganisms and molecules. Membrane mucins are a distinct group of mucins that are attached to epithelial cell surfaces where they create a dense glycocalyx facing the extracellular environment. All mucin proteins carry long stretches of tandemly repeated sequences that undergo extensive O-linked glycosylation to form linear mucin domains. However, the repetitive nature of mucin domains makes them prone to recombination and render their genetic sequences particularly difficult to read with standard sequencing technologies. As a result, human mucin genes suffer from significant sequence gaps that have hampered investigation of gene function in health and disease. Here we leveraged a recent human genome assembly to identify a previously unmapped MUC3B gene located within a cluster of four structurally related membrane mucin genes that we entitle the MUC3 cluster at q22 locus in chromosome 7. We found that MUC3B shares high sequence identity with the known MUC3A gene, and that the two genes are governed by evolutionarily conserved regulatory elements. Furthermore, we show that MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC12 and MUC17 in the human MUC3 cluster are exclusively expressed in intestinal epithelial cells. Our results complete existing genetic gaps in the MUC3 cluster that is a conserved genetic unit during primate evolution. We anticipate our results to be the starting point for detection of new polymorphisms in the MUC3 cluster associated with human diseases. Moreover, our study provides the basis for exploration of intestinal mucin gene function in widely used experimental models such as human intestinal organoids and genetic mouse models.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic communication is critical during early life phases in precocial birds. For example, adult alarm calls can elicit antipredator behaviour in young, and chick vocalisations can communicate information to parents about chick identity, condition, location, sex, or age. We investigated whether chick calls of two species of Australian Charadriidae vary with sex or body mass. We handled Red-capped Plover Charadrius ruficapillus and Southern Masked Lapwing Vanellus miles novaehollandiae chicks for purposes of measurement, blood sampling, and banding. We opportunistically recorded their distress calls while in the hand, and analysed the calls to determine whether call structure is related to sex or body mass (a proxy for age). We measured five traits per call, plus time intervals between successive calls, for 26 plover chicks (2600 calls) and 95 lapwing chicks (6835 calls). In plovers, inter-call intervals were shorter in males and both inter-call interval and the dominant frequency range of calls decreased with increasing body mass. In lapwings, frequency modulation (computed as the range in the rate of change of the dominant frequency) was lower in male calls. The dominant frequency range of lapwing calls decreased with mass in both sexes, but the decline was greater in males, resulting in a lower dominant frequency range in males. Frequency modulation and entropy of lapwing calls also decreased with increasing body mass. Minimum dominant frequency did not change with body mass or sex in either species. Our study provides the first evidence for charadriid chicks of (a) a sexual difference in call structure and rate and (b) gradual growth-related changes in call structure and rate, across chicks. Studies on calls from a greater range of chick ages and from more species within this large and diverse family would be valuable. We provide a foundation for further studies of shorebird vocalisations during growth, which may elucidate the development and functional significance of such vocalisations.",

In resting cells, P-TEFb is absent, because CycT1 is dephosphorylated, released from CDK9 and rapidly degraded. In this study, we identified the mechanism of this degradation. We mapped the ubiquitination and degradation of free CycT1 to its N-terminal region from positions 1 to 280. This region is ubiquitinated at six lysines, where E3 ligases Siah1 and Siah2 bind and degrade these sequences. Importantly, the inhibition of Siah1/2 rescued the expression of free CycT1 in proliferating as well as resting primary cells. We conclude that Siah1/2 are the E3 ligases that bind and degrade the dissociated CycT1 in resting, terminally differentiated, anergic and/or exhausted cells.",

Oncogenes modify anchorage-dependent mechanisms in cells during cancer progression.

We quantified the critical adhesion strengths of MCF7, MDAMB-231, A549, HPL1D, HeLa, and NIH3T3 cells using a custom fluid shear device. The detachment response was sigmoidal for each cell type. A549 and MDAMB-231 cells had significantly lower adhesion strengths at {tau}50 than their non-invasive counterparts, HPL1D and MCF7. Detachment dynamics was inversely correlated with cell invasion potentials. A theoretical model, based on {tau}50 values and the distribution of cell areas on substrates, provided good fits to data from de-adhesion experiments. Quantification of cell tractions, using the Reg-FTTC method on 10 kPa polyacrylamide gels, showed highest values for invasive, MDAMB-231 and A549, cells compared to non-invasive cells. Immunofluorescence studies show differences in vinculin distributions: non-invasive cells have distinct vinculin puncta, whereas invasive cells have more dispersed distributions. The cytoskeleton in non-invasive cells was devoid of well-developed stress fibers, and had thicker cortical actin bundles in the boundary. These correlations in adhesion strengths with cell invasiveness, demonstrated here, may be useful in cancer diagnostics and other pathologies featuring misregulation in adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic lethality -- a genetic interaction that results in cell death when two genetic deficiencies co-occur but not when either deficiency occurs alone -- can be co-opted for cancer therapeutics. A pair of paralog genes is among the most straightforward synthetic lethal interaction by virtue of their redundant functions. Here we demonstrate a paralog-based synthetic lethality by targeting Vaccinia-Related Kinase 1 (VRK1) in Vaccinia-Related Kinase 2 (VRK2)-methylated glioblastoma (GBM). VRK2 is silenced by promoter methylation in approximately two-thirds of GBM, an aggressive cancer with few available targeted therapies. Genetic knockdown of VRK1 in VRK2-null or VRK2-methylated cells results in decreased activity of the downstream substrate Barrier to Autointegration Factor (BAF), a regulator of post-mitotic nuclear envelope formation. VRK1 knockdown, and thus reduced BAF activity, causes nuclear lobulation, blebbing and micronucleation, which subsequently results in G2/M arrest and DNA damage. The VRK1-VRK2 synthetic lethal interaction is dependent on VRK1 kinase activity and is rescued by ectopic VRK2 expression. Knockdown of VRK1 leads to robust tumor growth inhibition in VRK2-methylated GBM xenografts. These results indicate that inhibiting VRK1 kinase activity could be a viable therapeutic strategy in VRK2-methylated GBM.",

GC-A is activated by endogenous atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), and this activation leads to the production of 3,5-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). This system plays an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis. However, utilization of this receptor as a drug target has so far been limited to peptides, even though small molecule modulators allow oral administration and longer half-life. We have identified small molecular allosteric enhancers of GC-A, which strengthened ANP or BNP activation in various in vitro and ex vivo systems. These compounds do not mediate their actions through previously described allosteric binding sites or via known mechanisms of action. In addition, their selectivity and activity are dependent on only one amino acid in GC-A. Our findings show that there is a novel allosteric binding site on GC-A, which can be targeted by small molecules that increase the signaling effects of ANP and BNP.",

Kisspeptin (KISS1)/kisspeptin receptor (KISS1R) signaling in GnRH neurons plays an essential role in reproductive function. As the kisspeptin receptor is present in the pituitary, kisspeptin signaling via the Kiss1r may regulate reproductive function at the level of pituitary. Using Cre/Lox technology, we deleted the Kiss1r gene in pituitary gonadotropes (PKiRKO). PKiRKO male and females have normal genital development, puberty onset, and fertility. Females have normal LH, FSH and estradiol while males had significantly increased basal serum FSH levels with no differences in basal serum LH, or testosterone levels.

    "abstract": "Land plant chloroplasts differ from algal ones for their thylakoid membranes being organized in grana: piles of vesicles paired by their stromal surface, forming domains including Photosystem (PS) II and its antenna while excluding PS I and ATPase to stroma membranes, connecting grana stacks. The molecular basis of grana stacking remain unclear. We obtained genotypes lacking the trimeric antenna complex (Lhcb1-2-3), the monomeric Lhcb4-5-6, or both. Full deletion caused loss of grana, while either monomers or trimers support 50% stacking. The expression of Lhcb5 alone restored stacking at 50%, while Lhcb2 alone produced huge grana which broke down upon light exposure. Cyclic electron transport was maintained in the lack of stacking, while excitation energy balance between photosystems and the repair efficiency of damaged Photosystem II were affected. We conclude that grana evolved for need of regulating energy balance between photosystems under terrestrial canopy involving rapid changes in photon spectral distribution.",

    "abstract": "The search for effective therapeutic targets in fields like regenerative medicine and cancer research has generated interest in cell fate reprogramming. This cellular reprogramming paradigm can drive cells to a desired target state from any initial state. However, methods for identifying reprogramming targets remain limited for biological systems that lack large sets of experimental data or a dynamical characterization. We present NETISCE, a novel computational tool for identifying cell fate reprogramming targets in static networks. In combination with machine learning algorithms, NETISCE estimates the attractor landscape and predicts reprogramming targets using Signal Flow Analysis and Feedback Vertex Set Control, respectively. Through validations in studies of cell fate reprogramming from developmental, stem cell, and cancer biology, we show that NETISCE can predict previously identified cell fate reprogramming targets and identify potentially novel combinations of targets. NETISCE extends cell fate reprogramming studies to larger-scale biological networks without the need for full model parameterization and can be implemented by experimental and computational biologists to identify parts of a biological system relevant to the desired reprogramming task.",

    "abstract": "The ability to learn new information and behaviors is a vital component of survival in most animal species. This learning can occur via direct experience or through observation of another individual (i.e., social learning). While research focused on understanding the neural mechanisms of direct learning is prevalent, less work has aimed at understanding the brain circuitry mediating the acquisition and recall of socially acquired information. We aimed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying recall of socially acquired information by having rats sequentially recall a socially transmitted food preference (STFP) and a fear association via fear conditioning by-proxy (FCbP). Brain tissue was processed for mRNA expression of the immediate early gene (IEG) Arc, which reliably expresses in the cell nucleus following transcription before migrating to the cytoplasm over the next 25 minutes. Given this timeframe, we were able to identify whether Arc transcription was triggered by STFP recall, FCbP recall, or following recall of both memories. Surprisingly - and contrary to past research examining expression of other IEGs following STFP or FCbP recall separately - we found no differences in any of the Arc expression measures across a number of prefrontal regions and the vCA3 of the hippocampus between controls, demonstrators, and observers, though we did detect an overall effect of sex in a number of regions. We theorize that these results may indicate that relatively little Arc-dependent neural restructuring is taking place in the prefrontal cortices following recall of a recently socially acquired information or directly acquired fear associations in these areas.",

    "abstract": "Structural connectivity of the brain at different ages is analyzed using diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. The largest decrease of the number and average length of streamlines is found for the long inter-hemispheric links, with the strongest impact for frontal regions. From the BOLD functional MRI (fMRI) time series we identify age-related changes of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) and spatial covariation features of the FC links captured by metaconnectivity (MC). They indicate more constant dFC, but wider range and variance of MC. Finally we applied computational whole-brain network model based on oscillators, which mechanistically expresses the impact of the spatio-temporal structure of the brain (weights and the delays) to the dynamics. With this we tested several hypothesis, which revealed that the spatio-temporal reorganization of the brain with ageing, supports the observed functional fingerprints only if the model accounts for: (i) compensation of the individual brains for the overall loss of structural connectivity, and (ii) decrease of propagation velocity due to the loss of myelination. We also show that having these two conditions, it is sufficient to decompose the time-delays as bimodal distribution that only distinguishes between intra- and inter-hemispheric delays, and that the same working point also captures the static FC the best.",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses are distributed throughout various environments, and most RNA viruses have recently been identified by metatranscriptome sequencing. However, due to the high nucleotide diversity of RNA viruses, it is still challenging to identify novel RNA viruses from metatranscriptome data. To overcome this issue, we created a dataset of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domains that are essential for all RNA viruses belonging to Orthornavirae. Genes with RdRp domains from various RNA viruses were clustered based on their amino acid sequence similarity. For each cluster, a multiple sequence alignment was generated, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) profile was created if the number of sequences was greater than three. We further refined the 426 HMM profiles by detecting the RefSeq RNA virus sequences and subsequently combined the hit sequences with the RdRp domains. As a result, a total of 1,182 HMM profiles were generated from 12,502 RdRp domain sequences, and the dataset was named NeoRdRp. Almost all NeoRdRp HMM profiles successfully detected RdRp domains, specifically in the UniProt dataset. Furthermore, we compared the NeoRdRp dataset with two previously reported methods for RNA virus detection using metatranscriptome sequencing data. Our methods successfully identified most of the RNA viruses in the datasets; however, some RNA viruses were not detected, as in the cases of the other two methods. The NeoRdRp can be repeatedly improved by adding new RdRp sequences and is applicable as a system for detecting various RNA viruses from diverse metatranscriptome data.",

    "abstract": "Certain DNA sequences, including mirror-symmetric polypyrimidine/polypurine runs, are capable of folding into a triple-helix-containing non-B-form DNA structure called H-DNA. Such H-DNA-forming sequences are frequent in many eukaryotic genomes, including in mammals, and multiple lines of evidence indicate that these motifs are mutagenic and can impinge on DNA replication, transcription, and other aspects of genome function. In this study, we show that the triplex-forming potential of H-DNA motifs in the mouse genome can be evaluated using S1-sequencing (S1-seq), which uses the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-specific nuclease S1 to generate deep-sequencing libraries that report on the position of ssDNA throughout the genome. When S1-seq was applied to genomic DNA isolated from mouse testis cells and splenic B cells, we observed prominent clusters of S1-seq reads that appeared to be independent of endogenous double-strand breaks, that coincided with H-DNA motifs, and that correlated strongly with the triplex-forming potential of the motifs. Fine-scale patterns of S1-seq reads, including a pronounced strand asymmetry in favor of centrally-positioned reads on the pyrimidine-containing strand, suggested that this S1-seq signal is specific for one of the four possible isomers of H-DNA (H-y5). By leveraging the abundance and complexity of naturally occurring H-DNA motifs across the mouse genome, we further defined how polypyrimidine repeat length and the presence of repeat-interrupting substitutions modify the structure of H-DNA. This study provides a new approach for studying DNA secondary structure genome wide at high spatial resolution.",

Recently described as an NB-appended protein omnipresent in vertebrates, we now show that ZC3HC1, both in vivo and in vitro, enables in a step-wise fashion the recruitment of TPR subpopulations to the NB and their linkage to already NPC-anchored TPR polypeptides. We further demonstrate that the degron-mediated rapid elimination of ZC3HC1 results in the prompt detachment of the ZC3HC1-appended TPR polypeptides from the NB and their release back into the nucleoplasm again, underscoring the role of ZC3HC1 as a natural structural element of the NB. Finally, we show that ZC3HC1 can keep TPR polypeptides positioned even at sites remote from the NB, in line with ZC3HC1 functioning as a protein connecting TPR polypeptides.",

    "abstract": "Acute anemia induces rapid expansion of erythroid precursors and accelerated differentiation to replenish erythrocytes. Paracrine signals - involving cooperation between SCF/c-Kit signaling and other signaling inputs - are required for the increased erythroid precursor activity in anemia. Our prior work revealed that the Sterile Alpha Motif (SAM) Domain 14 (Samd14) gene increases the regenerative capacity of the erythroid system and promotes stress-dependent c-Kit signaling. However, the mechanism underlying Samd14s role in stress erythropoiesis is unknown. We identified a protein- protein interaction between Samd14 and the - and {beta} heterodimers of the F-actin capping protein (CP) complex. Knockdown of the CP {beta} subunit increased erythroid maturation in ex vivo cultures and decreased colony forming potential of stress erythroid precursors. In a genetic complementation assay for Samd14 activity, our results revealed that the Samd14-CP interaction is a determinant of erythroid precursor cell levels and function. Samd14-CP promotes SCF/c-kit signaling in CD71med spleen erythroid precursors. Given the roles of c-Kit signaling in hematopoiesis and Samd14 in c-Kit pathway activation, this mechanism may have pathological implications in acute/chronic anemia.",

    "abstract": "The males of Mexican katydids Nesoecia nigrispina (Stal, 1873) produce calling songs and protest sounds using the same stridulatory apparatus as in most of the other Ensifera at the base of the elytra. It includes pars stridens on the upper elytron and plectrum on the lower. Calling sounds of two types (fast and slow) are 2-pulse series, repeated with a frequency of 1.2-4.5 s-1. Protest signals in the form of short trills from the same pulse duration males produce with tactile stimulation. The pulse repetition rate is more higher than that of the calling sounds - up to 10 (mean c. 8) s-1. The frequency spectra of these signals have maxima in the band of 14-15 kHz. However, in addition to the sounds described, both males and females are capable to produce protest signals of the second type with the help of another sound apparatus, namely with the help of the wings. Insects with removed elytra are unable to produce an audible sound. Thus, the sound is produced by the friction of the wings on the elytra, but there are no specialized stridulatory structures on them. In individuals of both sexes, in response mainly to tactile stimulation, short clicks are recorded, which they make, apparently, by the mandibles. Vibrational signals at tremulation are emitted by individuals of both sexes during courtship and males, completing the calling signal cycle and after copulation. It is possible that vibrational signals are an additional factor in reproductive isolation in sympatric species, since the calling sound signals in representatives of the genus Nesoecia are similar and exhibit significant variability.",

When faced with a mixture of chemoeffectors, it is not obvious which direction the population will migrate. Predicting this direction requires an understanding of how bacteria process information about their surroundings. We used a multiscale mathematical model to relate molecular level details of their two-component signaling system to the probability that an individual cell changes its swimming direction to the chemotactic velocity of a bacterial population. We used a microfluidic device designed to maintain a constant chemical gradient to compare model predictions to experimental observations. We obtained parameter values for the multiscale model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis to individual stimuli, -methylaspartate and nickel ion, separately. Then without any additional fitting parameters, we predicted the response to chemoeffector mixtures. Migration of E. coli toward -methylaspartate was modulated by adding increasing concentrations of nickel ion. Thus, the migration direction was controlled by the relative concentrations of competing chemoeffectors in a predictable way. This study demonstrated the utility of a multiscale model to predict the migration direction of bacteria in the presence of competing chemoeffectors.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation organizes many membraneless structures in cells. The functional consequences of concentrating cellular machinery into biomolecular condensates, however, are largely unclear. One fundamental cellular function that has been linked to condensate formation is transcription. Here, we have reconstituted mitochondrial transcription in condensates from purified components. We find that the core components of the mttranscriptional machinery form multi-phasic, viscoelastic condensates in vitro. Strikingly, the rates of condensate-mediated transcription are substantially lower than equivalent reactions in bulk solution. These condensate-mediated decreases in transcriptional rates are associated with the formation of dynamically arrested vesicular structures that are driven by the production and accumulation of RNA during transcription. Using coarse-grained, equilibrium simulations, we show that the generation of RNA alters the phase behavior and the organization of transcriptional components within condensates and that the in vitro mtcondensates are non-equilibrium structures. Together, our in vitro and in silico approaches shed light on how proteins and (ribo)nucleic acids biophysically self-assemble within mitochondria in vivo. Our results highlight the complex morphologies of transcribing, multicomponent condensates and they illustrate the interdependent structure-function relationships in condensates.\n\nSignificance StatementMitochondria condense their genome into transcriptionally active mt-nucleoids. These structures fit the definition of biomolecular condensates that form via macromolecular phase separation. We take advantage of the ability to reconstitute mitochondrial transcriptional condensates in vitro from minimal components. We find that the production and accumulation of RNA alters the phase behavior of transcriptional condensates. The altered phase behavior is linked to the formation of arrested, non-equilibrium vesicular structures. Similar changes to phase behavior of proteins and (ribo)nucleic acids can be recapitulated in live mitochondria through knockdown of mt-nucleoid core components. Computer simulations help identify biophysical mechanisms that are needed to maintain the steady-state structures of transcriptional condensates.",

We successfully developed SAXS measurement methods for the cross-section aspect ratio and area of the crystalline-ordered CMF core, which showed higher density than the semi-disordered shell. The 1:1 aspect ratio suggested that CMFs remain mostly segregated, not fused. The area measurement revealed the chain number in the core zone (Ncore). The ratio of ordered cellulose over total cellulose, termed Roc, was determined by ssNMR. Using the formula N = Ncore / Roc, we found that the majority of wood CMFs contain 24 chains, conserved between gymnosperm and angiosperm trees. The average wood CMF has a crystalline-ordered core of [~]2.2 nm diameter and a semi-disordered shell of [~]0.5 nm thickness. In naturally and artificially aged wood, we only observed CMF aggregation (contact without crystalline continuity) but not fusion (forming conjoined crystalline unit). This further argued against the existence of partially fused CMFs in new wood, overturning the recently proposed 18-chain fusion hypothesis. Our findings are important for advancing wood structural knowledge and more efficient utilization of wood resources in sustainable bio-economies.",

    "abstract": "Nested hippocampal oscillations in the rodent give rise to temporal dynamics that may underlie learning, memory, and decision making. Although theta/gamma coupling in rodent CA1 occurs during exploration, in contrast to sharp-wave ripples that emerge in quiescence, it is less clear that these oscillatory regimes extend to primates. We, therefore, sought to identify correspondences in frequency bands, nesting, and behavioral coupling taken from the macaque hippocampus. We found that, in contrast to rodent oscillations, theta and gamma frequency bands in macaque CA1 were segregated by behavioral states. Beta2/gamma (15-70 Hz) had greater power during visual search while the theta band (3-10 Hz; peak [~]8 Hz) dominated during quiescence. Moreover, theta band amplitude was strongest when beta2/slow gamma (20-35 Hz) amplitude was weakest, occurring instead concomitant with higher frequencies (60-150 Hz). Spike-field coherence was most frequently seen in these three bands, (3-10 Hz, 20-35 Hz, and 60-150 Hz); however, the theta-band coherence was largely due to spurious coupling during sharp-wave ripples. Accordingly, no intrinsic theta spiking rhythmicity was apparent. These results support a role for beta2/slow gamma modulation in CA1 during active exploration in the primate that is decoupled from theta oscillations. The apparent difference to the rodent oscillatory canon calls for a shift in focus of frequency when considering the primate hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Epilepsy is a widely spread neurological disease, whose treatment often requires resection of the pathological cortical tissue. Interictal spike analysis observed in the non-invasively collected EEG or MEG data offers an attractive way to localize epileptogenic cortical structures for surgery planning purposes. Interictal spike detection in lengthy multichannel data is a daunting task that is still often performed manually. This frequently limits such an analysis to a small portion of the data which renders the appropriate risks of missing the potentially epileptogenic region. While a plethora of automatic spike detection techniques have been developed each with its own assumptions and limitations, non of them is ideal and the best results are achieved when the output of several automatic spike detectors are combined. This is especially true in the low signal-to-noise ratio conditions. To this end we propose a novel biomimetic approach for automatic spike detection based on a constrained mixed spline machinery that we dub as fast parametric curve matching (FPCM). Using the peak-wave shape parametrization, the constrained parametric morphological model is constructed and convolved with the observed multichannel data to efficiently determine mixed spline parameters corresponding to each time-point in the dataset. Then the logical predicates that directly map to verbalized text-book like descriptions of the expected interictal event morphology allow us to accomplish the spike detection task. The results of simulations mimicking typical low SNR scenario show the robustness and high ROC AUC values of the FPCM method as compared to the spike detection performed using more conventional approaches such as wavelet decomposition, template matching or simple amplitude thresholding. Applied to the real MEG and EEG data from the human patients and to rat ECoG data, the FPCM technique demonstrates reliable detection of the interictal events and localization of epileptogenic zones concordant with independent conclusions made by the epileptologist. Since the FPCM is computationally light, tolerant to high amplitude artifacts and flexible to accommodate verbalized descriptions of the arbitrary target morphology, it may complement the existing arsenal of means for analysis of noisy interictal datasets.",
