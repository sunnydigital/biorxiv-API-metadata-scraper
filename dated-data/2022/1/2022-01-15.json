    "abstract": "The Arabidopsis leaf veins bundle sheath cells (BSCs) - a selective barrier to water and solutes entering the mesophyll - increase the leaf radial hydraulic conductance (Kleaf) by acidifying the xylem sap by their plasma membrane H+-ATPase, AHA2. Based on this and on the BSCs expression of PHOT1 and PHOT2, and the known blue-light (BL)-induced Kleaf increase, we hypothesized that, resembling the guard cells, BL perception by the BSCs phots activates its H+-ATPase, which, consequently, upregulates Kleaf. Indeed, under BL, the Kleaf of the knockout mutant lines phot1-5, phot2-1, phot1-5phot2-1, and aha2-4 was lower than that of the WT. BSC-only-directed complementation of phot1-5 or aha2-4 by PHOT1 or AHA2, respectively, restored the BL-induced Kleaf increase. BSC-specific silencing of PHOT1 or PHOT2 prevented such Kleaf increase. A xylem-fed kinase inhibitor (tyrphostin 9) replicated this also in WT plants. White light - ineffective in the phot1-5 mutant - acidified the xylem sap (relative to darkness) in WT and in the PHOT1-complemented phot1-5. These results, supported by BL increase of BSC protoplasts water permeability and cytosolic pH and their hyperpolarization by BL, identify the BSCs as a second phot-controlled water conductance element in leaves, in series with stomatal conductance. Through both, BL regulates the leaf water balance.\n\nOne-Sentence summaryBlue light regulates the leaf hydraulic conductance via the bundle-sheath cells blue light PHOT receptors which, via an autonomous signaling pathway, activate the BSCs AHA2 H+-pump.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIntegrating multimodal data represents an effective approach to predicting biomedical characteristics, such as protein functions and disease outcomes. However, existing data integration approaches do not sufficiently address the heterogeneous semantics of multimodal data. In particular, early and intermediate approaches that rely on a uniform integrated representation reinforce the consensus among the modalities, but may lose exclusive local information. The alternative late integration approach that can address this challenge has not been systematically studied for biomedical problems.\n\nResultsWe propose Ensemble Integration (EI) as a novel systematic implementation of the late integration approach. EI infers local predictive models from the individual data modalities using appropriate algorithms, and uses effective heterogeneous ensemble algorithms to integrate these local models into a global predictive model. We also propose a novel interpretation method for EI models. We tested EI on the problems of predicting protein function from multimodal STRING data, and mortality due to COVID-19 from multimodal data in electronic health records. We found that EI accomplished its goal of producing significantly more accurate predictions than each individual modality. It also performed better than several established early integration methods for each of these problems. The interpretation of a representative EI model for COVID-19 mortality prediction identified several disease-relevant features, such as laboratory test (blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and calcium) and vital sign measurements (minimum oxygen saturation) and demographics (age). These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the EI framework for biomedical data integration and predictive modeling.\n\nAvailabilityCode and data are available at https://github.com/GauravPandeyLab/ensemble_integration.\n\nContactgaurav.pandey@mssm.edu",

    "abstract": "Diverging species are often genetically incompatible upon hybridization. Such incompatibilities are considered important in keeping the integrity of species from the disruption of hybrids. However, recent empirical work has shown that not all incompatibilities are gene-flow-proof, and they can collapse due to continuing hybridization. Counterintuitively, many studies found that incompatible alleles are already segregating within species, whereas they should go extinct quickly in a randomly mating population. Due to the complexity of multilocus epistasis, few general principles explain behaviors of incompatibilities under gene flow both within and between species. In the current work, we argue that the redundancy of genetic mechanisms can robustly determine the dynamics of intrinsic incompatibilities under gene flow. While higher genetic redundancy decreases the stability of incompatibilities during hybridization, it also increases the tolerance of incompatibility polymorphism within each species. We treat two general classes of incompatibilities. In the redundant class, similar to the classical Dobzhansky-Muller system, the collapse is continuous and eventually approaches quasi-neutral polymorphism between broadly-sympatric species, often as a result of isolation-by-distance. In the non-redundant class, analogous to the shifting-balance process, incompatibilities collapse abruptly with spatial traveling waves. We obtained simulated and analytical results for several incompatibility models to demonstrate the differences between the two classes. As both redundant and non-redundant genetic mechanisms of incompatibilities are common, the proposed conceptual framework may help understand the abundance of incompatibilities in natural populations.",

However, the role of the cells mechanical properties in detachment and migration is not well understood. This exploratory study aimed to assess how intracellular stiffness changes these processes.\n\nMethodsMDA-MB-231 cells were embedded as 10,000-cell spheroids in 2 and 4 mg/ml collagen matrices. Intracellular stiffness was assessed with mitochondria tracking microrheology of cells that migrated distances equivalent to four and six times the cell diameter (dC) from the spheroid and compared to cells at the spheroid surface (0dC), representing medium, high and no migration, respectively.\n\nResults and discussionThe mitochondrial mean square displacement and intracellular stiffness decreased during detachment and migration for both collagen concentrations (i.e. rigidities). The mean square displacement of 4dC and 6dC cells was similar, whereas cell stiffness was lower for 4dC than for 6dC cells. With increasing matrix rigidity, the intracellular stiffness decreased for 0dC cells and did not change for 4dC and 6dC cells. It is proposed that decreased cell stiffness drives detachment and migration and increased matrix rigidity physically hinders migration, and cells need to become softer or remodel the environment to migrate. The independence of the stiffness of migrated cells from matrix rigidity suggests that cells remodel their environment through matrix proteins cleavage to migrate.\n\nConclusionsThe study revealed the collective effects of enhanced migratory conditions and increased matrix rigidity on the mechanical properties of the cells. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor {beta} and the role of cell volume on detachment and migration in matrices with varying pore sizes are proposed targets for further studies on metastatic cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Aerial insectivores show worldwide population declines coinciding with shifts in agricultural practices. Increasing reliance on certain agricultural practices is thought to have led to an overall reduction in insect abundance that negatively affects aerial insectivore fitness. The relationship between prey availability and the fitness of insectivores may thus vary with the extent of agricultural intensity. It is therefore imperative to quantify the strength and direction of these associations. Here we used data from an 11-year study monitoring the breeding of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) and the availability of Diptera (their main prey) across a gradient of agricultural intensification in southern Quebec, Canada. This gradient was characterized by a shift in agricultural production, whereby landscapes composed of forage and pastures represented less agro-intensive landscapes and those focusing on large-scale arable row crop monocultures, such as corn (Zea mays) or soybean (Glycine max) that are innately associated with significant mechanization and agro-chemical inputs, represented more agro-intensive landscapes. We evaluated the landscape characteristics affecting prey availability, and how this relationship influences the fledging success, duration of the nestling period, fledgling body mass, and wing length as these variables are known to influence the population dynamics of this species. Diptera availability was greatest within predominately forested landscapes, while within landscapes dominated by agriculture, it was marginally greater in less agro-intensive areas. Of the measured fitness and body condition proxies, both fledging success and nestling body mass were positively related to prey availability. The impact of prey availability varied across the agricultural gradient as fledging success improved with increasing prey levels within forage landscapes yet declined in more agro-intensive landscapes. Finally, after accounting for prey availability, fledging success was lowest, nestling periods were the longest, and wing length of fledglings were shortest within more agro-intensive landscapes. Our results highlight the interacting roles that aerial insect availability and agricultural intensification have on the fitness of aerial insectivores, and by extension how food availability may interact with other aspects of breeding habitats to influence the population dynamics of predators.\n\nOpen ResearchData are not yet provided (option 4) as they are being used for other research projects.

In particular such analysis will be powerful in making inference from publicly available collections of genetic, transcriptomic and epigenetic data sets which are designed to study shared biological processes, but which vary in their target measurements, biological variation, unwanted noise, and batch variation. Thus, methods that enable the joint analysis of multiple data sets are needed to gain insights into shared biological processes that would otherwise be hidden by unwanted intra-data set variation. Here, we propose a method called two-stage linked component analysis (2s-LCA) to jointly decompose multiple biologically related experimental data sets with biological and technological relationships that can be structured into the decomposition. The consistency of the proposed method is established and its empirical performance is evaluated via simulation studies. We apply 2s-LCA to jointly analyze four data sets focused on human brain development and identify meaningful patterns of gene expression in human neurogenesis that have shared structure across these data sets.",

    "abstract": "The historical rise of intensive agricultural practices is hypothesized to be related to declines of grassland and aerial insectivorous birds. Drivers of declines may also influence the overall abundance and spatial distribution of insects within agricultural landscapes. Subsequently, the food provisioning rate of birds breeding within more agro-intensive landscapes may be impacted. Lower provisioning rates in agro-intensive landscapes may lead to reduced growth rate, body condition or fledging success of nestlings but also to diminished body condition of food provisioning adults. Results from a previous study supported this hypothesis as the fledging success and proxies of nestling body condition were lowest for an aerial insectivore breeding in more agro intensive landscapes. Of the multiple hypotheses put forward to explain these correlations, one mechanism may act through variation in food provisioning rates. In this study, we expounded on this hypothesis using data derived from the aforementioned study system and assessed if provisioning rates to nestlings and food provisioning behavior of adults varied across a gradient of agricultural intensification in a declining aerial insectivore, the Tree Swallow (Tachycineta bicolor). We found that the hourly provisioning rate was lower in agro-intensive landscapes, and yet travel distances were longest within less agro-intensive landscapes. Our results highlight that, in order to maximize long term average gain rates, Tree Swallows breeding within agro-intensive landscapes must forage with greater intensity, perhaps at a cost to themselves, or else costs will transfer to growing broods. Our work provides further evidence that agricultural intensification on the breeding grounds can contribute to the declines of aerial insectivores in part through a trophic pathway.",

A commonly used tool to detect geographic patterns from genetic data is principal components analysis (PCA) or the supervised linear discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC). However, genetic features produced from both approaches could fail to correctly characterize population structure for complex scenarios involving admixture. In this study, we introduce Kernel Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (KLFDAPC), a supervised nonlinear approach for inferring individual geographic genetic structure that could rectify the limitations of these approaches by preserving the multimodal space of samples. We tested the power of KLFDAPC to infer population structure and to predict individual geographic origin using neural networks. Simulation results showed that KLFDAPC significantly improved the population separability compared with PCA and DAPC. The application to POPRES and CONVERGE datasets indicated that the first two reduced features of KLFDAPC correctly recapitulated the geography of individuals, and significantly improved the accuracy of predicting individual geographic origin when compared to PCA and DAPC. Therefore, KLFDAPC can be useful for geographic ancestry inference, design of genome scans and correction for spatial stratification in GWAS that link genes to adaptation or disease susceptibility.",

Moreover, such scaffolds possess similar physical properties (porosity, stiffness) that resemble bone tissues and have been explored as potential biomaterials for tissue engineering applications. Here, plant-derived cellulose scaffolds were seeded with MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells. Moreover, to assess the potential of these biomaterials, we also applied cyclic hydrostatic pressure (HP) to the cells and scaffolds over time to mimic a bone-like environment more closely. After one week of proliferation, cell-seeded scaffolds were exposed to HP up to 270 KPa at a frequency of 1Hz, once per day, for up to two weeks. Scaffolds were incubated in osteogenic inducing media (OM) or regular culture media (CM). The effect of cyclic HP combined with OM on cell-seeded scaffolds resulted in an increase of differentiated cells. This corresponded to an upregulation of alkaline phosphatase activity and scaffold mineralization. Importantly, the results reveal that well known mechanosensitive pathways cells which regulate osteogenesis appear to remain functional even on novel plant-derived cellulosic biomaterials.",

    "abstract": "Pain-related sensory input is processed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) before being relayed to the brain. That processing profoundly influences whether stimuli are correctly or incorrectly perceived as painful. Significant advances have been made in identifying the types of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that comprise the SDH, and there is some information about how neuron types are connected, but it remains unclear how the overall circuit processes sensory input or how that processing is disrupted under chronic pain conditions. To explore SDH function, we developed a computational model of the circuit that is tightly constrained by experimental data. Our model comprises conductance-based neuron models that reproduce the characteristic firing patterns of spinal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory neuron populations, defined by their expression of genetic markers, spiking pattern, or morphology, were synaptically connected according to available qualitative data. Using a genetic algorithm, synaptic weights were tuned to reproduce projection neuron firing rates (model output) based on primary afferent firing rates (model input) across a range of mechanical stimulus intensities. Disparate synaptic weight combinations could produce equivalent circuit function, revealing degeneracy that may underlie heterogeneous responses of different circuits to perturbations or pathological insults. To validate our model, we verified that it responded to reduction of inhibition (i.e. disinhibition) and ablation of specific neuron types in a manner consistent with experiments. Thus validated, our model offers a valuable resource for interpreting experimental results and testing hypotheses in silico to plan experiments for examining normal and pathological SDH circuit function.\n\nSignificance StatementWe developed a multiscale computer model of the posterior part of spinal cord gray matter (spinal dorsal horn), involved in perception of touch and pain. The model reproduces several experimental observations and makes predictions about how specific types of spinal neurons and synapses influence projection neurons that send information to the brain. Misfiring of these projection neurons can produce anomalous sensations associated with chronic pain. Our computer model will not only assist in planning future experiments, but will also be useful for developing new pharmacotherapy for chronic pain disorders, connecting the effect of drugs acting at the molecular scale with emergent properties of neurons and circuits that shape the pain experience.",

    "abstract": "Protein structure prediction has recently been revolutionized when AlphaFold2 [1] predicted protein structures with near-experimental accuracy in the latest CASP14 season of critical assessment of methods of protein structure prediction (CASP). Among numerous implications, this breakthrough has led to a rapidly growing number of high-quality structural models [2]. We present a protocol ROPIUS0 for protein structure prediction and model selection and discuss its benefits in the new era of structure prediction. At the core of the ROPIUS0 protocol is the deep learning module developed for the selection of protein structural models. It is shown that the direct use of predicted inter-residue distances may be sufficient to discriminate between correct and incorrect protein folds, considering only a small fraction of predicted distances. We extensively tested the protocol: In the latest CASP14 prediction season, a ROPIUS0 variant based on model selection ranked 13th in the category of tertiary structure prediction. Its performance is on par with top-performing automated prediction servers when tested on the CASP13 dataset, and it performs similarly on a CAMEO dataset. The results suggest ways to improve searching for structurally similar and homologous proteins without considerably increasing speed. Our new open-source threading tool based on comparing a subset of inter-residue distances demonstrates the effectiveness and application of the deep learning module of the ROPIUS0 protocol.",

    "abstract": "Climate change predicts the increased frequency, duration, and intensity of inclement weather periods, such as unseasonably low temperatures (i.e., cold snaps) and prolonged precipitation. Many migratory species have advanced the phenology of important life history stages, and as a result will likely be exposed to these periods of inclement spring weather more often, thus risking reduced fitness and population growth. For declining avian species, including aerial insectivores, anthropogenic landscape changes such as agricultural intensification are another driver of population declines. These landscape changes may affect the foraging ability of food provisioning parents, and reduce the survival of nestlings exposed to inclement weather, through for example pesticide exposure impairing thermoregulation and punctual anorexia. Breeding in agro-intensive landscapes may thus exacerbate the negative effects of inclement weather under climate change. We observed that a significant reduction in the availability of insect prey occurred when daily maximum temperatures fell below 18.3{degrees}C, and thereby defined any day where the maximum temperature fell below this value as a day witnessing a cold snap. We then combined daily information on the occurrence of cold snaps and measures of precipitation to assess their impact on the fledging success of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) occupying a nest box system placed across a gradient of agricultural intensification. Estimated fledging success of this declining aerial insectivore was 36.2% lower for broods experiencing four cold snap days during the 12 days post hatching period versus broods experiencing none, and this relationship was worsened when facing more precipitation. We further found that the overall negative effects of a brood experiencing periods of inclement weather was exacerbated in more agro-intensive landscapes. Our results indicate that two of the primary hypothesized drivers of many avian population declines may interact to further increase the rate of declines in certain landscape contexts.",

The main types of explanatory models proposed so far - static or iterative - mirror this distinction but cannot adequately explain individual biases. Here we propose a new unifying model that explains individual variation as combination of sensory precision and beliefs about temporal continuity and predicts the experimentally found changes in biases when altering temporal continuity. Thus, according to the model, individual differences in perception depend on beliefs about how stimuli are generated in the world.",

    "abstract": "Task processing (e.g., the preparation and execution of responses) and task representation (e.g., the activation and maintenance of stimulus-response and context information) are two facets of cognitive control supported by lateral frontal cortex (LFC). However, the mechanistic overlap (or distinction) between these two facets is unknown. We explored this by combining a complex task mapping with a pre-cueing procedure. Participants made match/non-match judgments on pairs of stimuli during fMRI recording. Pre-cues on each trial gave variable amounts of information to the participant in anticipation of the stimulus. Our results demonstrated that regions throughout LFC were more active at the stimulus (when responses could be executed) than at the cue (when they could only be prepared), indicating that they supported execution of the task agnostic to the specific task representation. A subset of regions in left caudal LFC showed increased activity with more cue information at the cue and the reverse at the stimulus, suggesting their involvement in reducing uncertainty within the task representation. These results suggest that one component of task processing is preparing and executing the task according to the relevant representation, confined to left caudal LFC, while non-representational functions that occur primarily during execution are supported by different regions throughout the rest of LFC. We further conducted an exploratory investigation of connectivity between the two groups of regions in this study and their potential relationship to the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks. Regions with both patterns of activity appear to be part of the fronto-parietal network.",

    "abstract": "The cortico-basal ganglia circuit is needed to suppress prepotent actions and to facilitate controlled behavior. Under conditions of response conflict, the frontal cortex and subthalamic nucleus [STN] exhibit increased spiking and theta band power, which are linked to adaptive regulation of behavioral output. The electrophysiological mechanisms underlying these neural signatures of impulse control remain poorly understood. To address this lacuna, we constructed a novel large-scale, biophysically principled model of the subthalamopallidal [STN-Globus Pallidus externus (GPe)] network, and examined the mechanisms that modulate theta power and spiking in response to cortical input. Simulations confirmed that theta power does not emerge from intrinsic network dynamics but is robustly elicited in response to cortical input as burst events representing action selection dynamics. Rhythmic burst events of multiple cortical populations, representing a state of conflict where cortical motor plans vacillate in the theta range, led to prolonged STN theta and increased spiking, consistent with empirical literature. Notably, theta band signaling required NMDA, but not AMPA, currents, which were in turn related to a triphasic STN response characterized by spiking, silence and bursting periods. Finally, theta band resonance was also strongly modulated by architectural connectivity, with maximal theta arising when multiple cortical populations project to individual STN \"conflict detector\" units, due to an NMDA-dependent supralinear response. Our results provide insights into the biophysical principles and architectural constraints that give rise to STN dynamics during response conflict, and how their disruption can lead to impulsivity and compulsivity.",

Analysis of cryo-EM structures of the Spike (S) from Omicron reveals amino acid substitutions forging new interactions that stably maintain an \"active\" conformation for receptor recognition. The relatively more compact domain organization confers improved stability and enhances attachment but compromises the efficiency of viral fusion step. Alterations in local conformation, charge and hydrophobic microenvironments underpin the modulation of the epitopes such that they are not recognized by most NTD- and RBD-antibodies, facilitating viral immune escape. Apart from already existing mutations, we have identified three new immune escape sites: 1) Q493R, 2) G446S and 3) S371L/S373P/S375F that confers greater resistance to five of the six classes of RBD-antibodies. Structure of the Omicron S bound with human ACE2, together with analysis of sequence conservation in ACE2 binding region of 25 sarbecovirus members as well as heatmaps of the immunogenic sites and their corresponding mutational frequencies sheds light on conserved and structurally restrained regions that can be used for the development of broad-spectrum vaccines and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe muscle wasting disease caused by the lack of dystrophin. Heart failure, driven by cardiomyocyte death, fibrosis, and the development of dilated cardiomyopathy, is the leading cause of death in DMD patients. Current treatments decrease the mechanical load on the heart, but do not address the root cause of dilated cardiomyopathy: cardiomyocyte death. Previously, we showed that telomere shortening is a hallmark of cardiomyocytes in DMD patient cardiac tissues and in a mouse model of DMD we generated that manifests dilated cardiomyopathy. We also found that this telomere shortening is recapitulated in DMD cardiomyocytes differentiated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Here we further characterize that DMD cardiomyocytes exhibit reduced cell size, nuclear size, and sarcomere density compared to healthy isogenic controls. The telomere-binding protein, TRF2, is a core component of the shelterin complex, which protects chromosome ends and is expressed at lower levels in DMD cardiomyocytes compared to controls. We investigated whether preservation of telomere length could be achieved with upregulation of TRF2. We found that TRF2 upregulation in DMD cardiomyocytes increased telomere lengths, cell size, nuclear size, sarcomere density, and cell survival. These data suggest TRF2 gene therapy has the potential to delay the onset of dilated cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the genes LMNA and BANF1 can lead to accelerated aging syndromes called progeria. The protein products of these genes, A-type lamins and BAF, respectively, are nuclear envelope (NE) proteins that interact and participate in various cellular processes, including nuclear envelope rupture and repair. BAF localizes to sites of nuclear rupture and recruits NE-repair machinery, including the LEM-domain proteins, ESCRT-III complex, A-type lamins, and membranes. Here, we show that it is a mobile, nucleoplasmic population of A-type lamins that is rapidly recruited to ruptures in a BAF-dependent manner via BAFs association with the Ig-like {beta} fold domain of A-type lamins. These initially mobile lamins become progressively stabilized at the site of rupture. Farnesylated prelamin A and lamin B1 fail to localize to nuclear ruptures, unless that farnesylation is inhibited. Progeria-associated LMNA mutations inhibit the recruitment affected A-type lamin to nuclear ruptures, due to either permanent farnesylation or inhibition of BAF binding. A progeria-associated BAF mutant targets to nuclear ruptures but is unable to recruit A-type lamins. Together, these data reveal the mechanisms that determine how lamins respond to nuclear ruptures and how progeric mutations of LMNA and BANF1 impair recruitment of A-type lamins to nuclear ruptures.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveRegulation of proteasomal activity is an essential component of cellular proteostasis and function. This is evident in patients with mutations in proteasome subunits and regulators, who suffer from proteasome-associated autoinflammatory syndromes (PRAAS). These patients display lipodystrophy and fevers, which may be partly related to adipocyte malfunction and abnormal thermogenesis in adipose tissue. However, the cell-intrinsic pathways that could underlie these symptoms are unclear. Here, we investigate the impact of two proteasome subunits implicated in PRAAS, Psmb4 and Psmb8, on differentiation, function and proteostasis of brown adipocytes.\n\nMethodsIn immortalized mouse brown pre-adipocytes, levels of Psmb4, Psmb8, and downstream effectors genes were downregulated through reverse transfection with siRNA. Adipocytes were differentiated and analyzed with various assays of adipogenesis, lipogenesis, lipolysis, inflammation, and respiration.\n\nResultsLoss of Psmb4, but not Psmb8, disrupted proteostasis and adipogenesis. Proteasome function was reduced upon Psmb4 loss, but partly recovered by the activation of Nuclear factor, erythroid-2, like-1 (Nfe2l1). In addition, cells displayed higher levels of surrogate inflammation and stress markers, including Activating transcription factor-3 (Atf3). Simultaneous silencing of Psmb4 and Atf3 lowered inflammation and restored adipogenesis.\n\nConclusionsOur study shows that Psmb4 is required for adipocyte development and function in cultured adipocytes. These results imply that in humans with PSMB4 mutations, PRAAS-associated lipodystrophy is partly caused by disturbed adipogenesis. While we uncover a role for Nfe2l1 in the maintenance of proteostasis under these conditions, Atf3 is a key effector of inflammation and blocking adipogenesis. In conclusion, our work highlights how proteasome dysfunction is sensed and mitigated by the integrated stress response in adipocytes with potential relevance for PRAAS patients and beyond.\n\nHighlights- PRAAS-associated PSMB4 is required for brown adipocyte differentiation\n- Loss of PSMB4 activates NFE2L1 to counteract proteasome dysfunction\n- The ATF3 pathway regulates adipocyte dysfunction and inflammation\n- Loss of ATF3 restores adipogenesis in cells with loss of PSMB4\n\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476367v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c9c5eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae0674org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@29c741org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d8a584_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "In-solution enrichment for hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has been the source of >70% of all genome-scale ancient human DNA data published to date. This approach has made it possible to generate data for one to two orders of magnitude lower cost than random shotgun sequencing, making it economical to study ancient samples with low proportions of human DNA, and increasing the rate of conversion of sampled remains into working data thereby facilitating ethical stewardship of human remains. So far, nearly all ancient DNA data obtained using in-solution enrichment has been generated using a set of bait sequences targeting about 1.24 million SNPs (the  1240k reagent). These sequences were published in 2015, but synthesis of the reagent has been cost-effective for only a few laboratories. In 2021, two companies made available reagents that target the same core set of SNPs along with supplementary content. Here, we test the properties of the three reagents on a common set of 27 ancient DNA libraries across a range of richness of DNA content and percentages of human molecules. All three reagents are highly effective at enriching many hundreds of thousands of SNPs. For all three reagents and a wide range of conditions, one round of enrichment produces data that is as useful as two rounds when tens of millions of sequences are read out as is typical for such experiments. In our testing, the \"Twist Ancient DNA\" reagent produces the highest coverages, greatest uniformity on targeted positions, and almost no bias toward enriching one allele more than another relative to shotgun sequencing. Allelic bias in 1240k enrichment has made it challenging to carry out joint analysis of these data with shotgun data, creating a situation where the ancient DNA community has been publishing two important bodes of data that cannot easily be co-analyzed by population genetic methods. To address this challenge, we introduce a subset of hundreds of thousands of SNPs for which 1240k data can be effectively co-analyzed with all other major data types.",

    "abstract": "Stress hormone signaling via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) modulates vulnerability to stress-related disorders, but whether GR influences how the brain encodes contextual experience is unknown. Mice with lifelong GR overexpression in forebrain glutamatergic neurons (GRov) show increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli. This phenotype is developmentally programmed and associated with profound changes in hippocampal gene expression. We hypothesized that GR overexpression influences hippocampal encoding of experiences. To test our hypothesis, we performed in vivo microendoscopic calcium imaging of 1359 dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells in freely behaving male and female WT and GRov mice during exploration of a novel open field. We compared calcium amplitude and event rate as well as sensitivity to center location and mobility between genotypes. GRov neurons exhibited higher average calcium activity than WT neurons in the novel open field. While most neurons showed sensitivity to center location and/or mobility, GRov neurons were more likely to be sensitive to center location and less likely to be sensitive to mobility, as compared to WT neurons. More than one-third of behavior-selective GRov neurons were uniquely sensitive to location without mobility sensitivity; these uniquely center-sensitive neurons were rare in WT. We conclude that dorsal CA1 pyramidal cells in GRov mice show increased activity in a novel environment and preferentially encode emotionally salient behavior. This heightened sensitivity to a novel environment and preferential encoding of emotionally salient elements of experience could underlie differential stress vulnerability in humans with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity.\n\nSignificance Statement (120 words maximum)Endogenous stress hormones, glucocorticoids, are known to alter vulnerability to stress-related disorders. Here, we find that increased sensitivity to glucocorticoid via lifelong overexpression of glucocorticoid receptor in forebrain neurons (GRov) alters the encoding of environmental experiences in the hippocampus. GRov mice showed increased activity of dorsal CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells during exploration of a novel environment and more sensitivity to emotionally relevant behaviors. These changes in how hippocampal neurons encode environmental experiences could underlie the differences in stress vulnerability in humans with genetic and epigenetic differences in glucocorticoid receptor signaling.",

    "abstract": "It is well-established that chronic HIV infection causes persistent low-grade inflammation that induces premature aging of the immune system in HIV patient including senescence of memory and effector CD8 T cells. To uncover the reasons of gradually diminished potency of CD8 T cells from chronically HIV infected people, we have analyzed cellular morphology and dynamics of the synaptic interface followed exposure of peripheral polyclonal CD8 T cells at various differentiation stages to planar lipid bilayers. The above parameters were linked to pattern of degranulation that determines efficiency of CD8 T cells cytolytic response. We found a large fraction of naive T cells from HIV infected people developing mature synapses and demonstrating focused degranulation, a signature of a differentiated T cells. Further differentiation of aberrant naive T cells leads to development of anomalous effector T cells undermining their capacity to control HIV and other viruses that could be contained otherwise.",

    "abstract": "Understanding macroevolution on islands requires knowledge of the closest relatives of is-land species on the mainland. The evolutionary relationships between island and mainland species can be reconstructed using phylogenies, to which models can be fitted to understand the dynamical processes of colonisation and diversification. But how much information on the mainland is needed to gain insight into macroevolution on islands? Here we first test whether species turnover on the mainland and incomplete mainland sampling leave recognis-able signatures in community phylogenetic data. We find predictable phylogenetic patterns: colonisation times become older and the perceived proportion of endemic species increases as mainland turnover and incomplete knowledge increase. We then analyse the influence of these factors on the inference performance of the island biogeography model DAISIE, a whole-island community phylogenetic model that assumes that mainland species do not diversify, and that the mainland is fully sampled in the phylogeny. We find that colonisation and diversification rate are estimated with little bias in the presence of mainland extinction and incomplete sampling. By contrast, the rate of anagenesis is overestimated under high levels of mainland extinction and incomplete sampling, because these increase the perceived level of island endemism. We conclude that community-wide phylogenetic and endemism datasets of island species carry a signature of mainland extinction and sampling. The ro-bustness of parameter estimates suggests that island diversification and colonisation can be studied even with limited knowledge of mainland dynamics.",

    "abstract": "MotivationModern genomic sequencing data is trending toward longer sequences with higher accuracy. Many analyses using these data will center on alignments, but classical exact alignment algorithms are infeasible for long sequences. The recently proposed WFA algorithm demonstrated how to perform exact alignment for long, similar sequences in O(sN) time and O(s2) memory, where s is a score that is low for similar sequences (Marco-Sola et al., 2021). However, this algorithm still has infeasible memory requirements for longer sequences. Also, it uses an alternate scoring system that is unfamiliar to many bioinformaticians.\n\nResultsWe describe variants of WFA that improve its asymptotic memory use from O(s2) to O(s3/2) and its asymptotic run time from O(sN) to O(s2 + N). We expect the reduction in memory use to be particularly impactful, as it makes it practical to perform highly multithreaded megabase-scale exact alignments in common compute environments. In addition, we show how to fold WFAs alternate scoring into the broader literature on alignment scores.\n\nAvailabilityAll code is publicly available for use and modification at https://github.com/jeizenga/wfalm.\n\nContactjeizenga@ucsc.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available online.",

    "abstract": "Banana being a major food crop all around the world, attracts various research interests in crop improvement. In banana, complete genome sequences of Musa accuminata and Musa balbisiana are available. However, the mitochondrial genome is not sequenced or assembled. Mitochondrial (mt) genes play an important role in flower and seed development and in Cytoplasmic Male Sterility. Unraveling banana mt genome architecture will be a foundation for understanding inheritance of traits and their evolution. In this study, the complete banana mt genome is assembled from the whole genome sequence data of the Musa acuminata subsp. malaccensis DH-Pahang. The mt genome sequence acquired by this approach was 409574 bp and it contains, 54 genes coding for 25 respiratory complex proteins 15 ribosomal proteins, 12 tRNA genes and two ribosomal RNA gene. Except atpB, rps11 and rps19 other genes are in multiple copies. The copy number is 12 in tRNA genes. In addition, nearly 25% tandem repeats are also present in it. These mt proteins are identical to the mt proteins present in the other members of AA genome and share 98% sequence similarity with M. balbisiana. The C to U RNA editing is profoundly higher (87 vs 13%) in transcripts of M. balbisiana (BB) compared to M. accuminata (AA). The banana AA mitochondrial genome is tightly packed with 233 genes, with less rearrangements and just 5.3% chloroplast DNA in it. The maintenance of high copy number of functional mt genes suggest that they have a crucial role in the evolution of banana.",

To understand the principles underlying the drastic fold switch in RfaH, we elucidated the thermodynamic stability and the structural dynamics of two RfaH- and four NusG/Spt5-KOW domains by combining biophysical and structural biology methods. We find that the RfaH-KOW {beta}-barrel is thermodynamically less stable than that of most NusG/Spt5-KOWs and we show that it is in equilibrium with a globally unfolded species, which, strikingly, contains two helical regions that prime the transition towards the -hairpin.

    "abstract": "Bone tuberculosis is widely characterized by irreversible bone destruction caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Mycobacterium has the ability to adapt to various environmental stresses by altering its transcriptome in order to establish infection in the host. Thus, it is of critical importance to understand the transcriptional profile of M. tuberculosis during infection in the bone environment compared to axenic cultures of exponentially growing M.tb. In the current study, we characterized the in vivo transcriptome of M. tuberculosis within abscesses or necrotic specimens obtained from patients with bone TB using whole genome microarrays in order to gain insight into the M. tuberculosis adaptive response within this host microenvironment. A total of 914 mycobacterial genes were found to be significantly over-expressed and 1688 were repressed (fold change>2; p-value [&le;]0.05) in human bone TB specimens. Overall, the mycobacteria displayed a hypo-metabolic state with significant (p[&le;]0.05) downregulation of major pathways involved in translational machinery, cellular and protein metabolism and response to hypoxia. However, significant enrichment (p [&le;]0.05) of amino-sugar metabolic processes, membrane glycolipid biosynthesis, amino acid biosynthesis (serine, glycine, arginine and cysteine) and accumulation of mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex suggests possible mycobacterial survival strategies within the bone lesions by strengthening its cell wall and cellular integrity. Data were also screened for M.tb virulence proteins using Virulent Pred and VICM Pred tools, which revealed five genes (Rv1046c, Rv1230c, DppD, PE_PGRS26 and PE_PGRS43) with a possible role in the pathogenesis of bone TB. Next, an osteoblast cell line model for bone TB was developed allowing for significant intracellular multiplication of M.tb. Interestingly, three virulence genes (Rv1046c, DppD and PE_PGRS26) identified from human bone TB microarray data were also found to be overexpressed by intracellular M. tuberculosis in osteoblast cell lines. Overall, these data demonstrate that M. tuberculosis alters its transcriptome as an adaptive strategy to survive in the host and establish infection in bone. Additionally, the in vitro osteoblast model we describe may facilitate our understanding of the pathogenesis of bone TB.\n\nAuthor SummaryMusculoskeletal tuberculosis is the third most common manifestation of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis and massive bone destruction along with vertebral discs are one of the hallmarks of this disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent, has the tremendous potential to adapt itself to different host environments due to its ability to alter the expression of genes/proteins belonging to different pathways. This study shows that the mycobacterial infection in bone is driven by the increased expression of genes belonging to cell wall remodelling and DNA damage repair pathways important for its survival. Further data analysis showed that some of these genes are coding for proteins possessing virulence potential that may be essential for survival of M. tuberculosis under such hostile environment of bone. We also developed an in vitro model of bone tuberculosis using an osteoblast cell line and validated the expression of these virulence factors. Identification of such virulence factors in the bone environment by M. tuberculosis may aid to identify new therapeutic targets for bone TB. Further, development of cell line model for bone TB is important to understand some unknown facets of this disease.",

    "abstract": "Marine phytoplankton are responsible for about half of the photosynthesis on Earth. Many are mixotrophs, combining photosynthesis with heterotrophic assimilation of organic carbon but the relative contribution of these two carbon sources is not well quantified. Here, single-cell measurements reveal that Prochlorococcus at the base of the photic zone in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea are obtaining only ~20% of carbon required for growth by photosynthesis. Consistently, laboratory-calibrated evaluations of Prochlorococcus photosynthesis indicate that carbon fixation is systematically too low to support published in situ growth rates in the deep photic layer of the Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, agent-based model simulations show that mixotrophic cells maintain realistic growth rates and populations 10s of meters deeper than obligate photo-autotrophs, deepening the nutricline and Deep Chlorophyll Maximum by ~20 m. Time-series of Prochlorococcus ecotype-abundance from the subtropical North Atlantic and North Pacific suggest that up to 30% of the Prochlorococcus cells live where light intensity is not enough to sustain obligate photo-autotrophic populations during warm, stratified periods. Together, these data and models suggest that mixotrophy underpins the ecological success of a large fraction of the global Prochlorococcus population and its collective genetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated virus (AAV) is a small ssDNA satellite virus of high interest (in recombinant form) as a safe and effective gene therapy vector. AAVs human cell entry receptor (AAVR) contains Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) domains bound by AAV. Seeking understanding of the spectrum of interactions, goat AAVGo.1 is investigated, because its host is the species most distant from human with reciprocal cross-species cell susceptibility. The structure of AAVGo.1, solved by cryo-EM to 2.9 [A] resolution, is most similar to AAV5. Through ELISA studies, it is shown that AAVGo.1 binds to human AAVR (huAAVR) more strongly than do AAV2 or AAV5, and that it joins AAV5 in a class that binds exclusively to PKD domain 1 (PKD1), in contrast to other AAVs that interact primarily with PKD2. The AAVGo.1 cryo-EM structure of a complex with a PKD12 fragment of huAAVR at 2.4 [A] resolution shows PKD1 bound with minimal change in virus structure, except for disordering of a neighboring surface loop. Only 4 of the 42 capsid protein sequence differences between AAVGo.1 and AAV5 occur at the PKD1 binding interface. These result in only minor conformational changes in AAVR, including a near rigid domain rotation with maximal displacement of the receptor by ~1 [A]. A picture emerges of two classes of AAV with completely different modes of binding to the same AAVR receptor, but within each class atomic interactions are mostly conserved.\n\nIMPORTANCEAdeno-Associated Virus (AAV) is a small ssDNA satellite parvovirus. As a recombinant vector with a protein shell encapsidating a transgene, recombinant AAV (rAAV) is a leading delivery vehicle for gene therapy with two FDA-approved treatments and 150 clinical trials for 30 diseases. The human entry receptor huAAVR has five PKD domains. To date, all serotypes, except AAV5, have interacted primarily with the second PKD domain, PKD2. Goat is the AAV host most distant from human with cross-species cell infectivity. AAVGo.1 is similar in structure to AAV5, the two forming a class with a distinct mode of receptor-binding. Within the two classes, binding interactions are mostly conserved, giving an indication of the latitude available in modulating delivery vectors.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an alphavirus of the Togaviridae family, is the causative agent of the human disease chikungunya fever (CHIKF), which is characterized by debilitating acute and chronic arthralgia. No licensed vaccines or antivirals exist for CHIKV. Preventing the attachment of viral particles to host cells is an attractive intervention strategy. Viral entry of enveloped viruses from diverse families including Filoviridae and Flaviviridae is mediated or enhanced by phosphatidylserine receptors (PSRs). PSRs facilitate the attachment of enveloped viruses to cells by binding to exposed phosphatidylserine (PS) in the viral lipid membrane - a process termed viral apoptotic mimicry. To investigate the role of viral apoptotic mimicry during CHIKV infection, we produced viral particles with discrete amounts of exposed PS on the virion envelope by exploiting the cellular distribution of phospholipids at the plasma membrane. We found that CHIKV particles containing high outer leaflet PS (produced in cells lacking flippase activity) were more infectious in Vero cells than particles containing low levels of outer leaflet PS (produced in cells lacking scramblase activity). However, the same viral particles were similarly infectious in NIH3T3 and HAP1 cells, suggesting PS levels can influence infectivity only in cells with high levels of PSRs. Interestingly, PS-dependent CHIKV entry was observed in mosquito Aag2 cells, but not C6/36 cells. These data demonstrate that CHIKV entry via viral apoptotic mimicry is cell-type dependent. Furthermore, viral apoptotic mimicry has a mechanistic basis to influence viral dynamics in vivo in both the human and mosquito host.\n\nImportanceOutbreaks of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) have occurred throughout Africa, Asia, and Europe. Climate change permits the expansion of Aedes mosquito vectors into more temperate regions, broadening the geographic range and increasing the frequency of future human outbreaks. The molecular basis underlying the broad host and cellular tropism of CHIKV remains unresolved. While several host molecules have been implicated in CHIKV viral attachment and entry, the role of lipid-mediated attachment (viral apoptotic mimicry) is unclear. We observed that higher levels of externalized phosphatidylserine (PS) in the viral lipid bilayer correlated with enhanced CHIKV infectivity in mammalian cells abundant with PS receptors and lacking alternative attachment factors. Interestingly, CHIKV infection in mosquito Aag2 cells was also affected by viral PS accessibility. This study further delineates the role of virus-cell attachment molecules in CHIKV infection. Viral apoptotic mimicry has potential to influence CHIKV dynamics in vivo in both the human and mosquito host.",

Our results showed that tinted EC windows let in higher energy, shorter wavelength daylight than those with clear window and blind. The growth rates of pathogenic bacteria and fungi were significantly lower in spaces with EC windows compared to blinds: nearly 100% growth rate reduction was observed when EC windows were in their clear state followed by 41-100% reduction in bacterial growth rate and 26-42% reduction in fungal growth rate when EC windows were in their darkest tint.

This revealed the packing of Tpp49Aa1 within these nanocrystals, isolated from sporulated bacteria, as a homodimer with a large intermolecular interface, shedding light on natural crystallization. Complementary experiments conducted at varied pH also enabled investigations of the early structural events leading up to the dissolution of natural Tpp49Aa1 crystals. Using modelling, we propose a potential interaction between Tpp49Aa1 and Cry48Aa1 that may play a role in their codependency and broaden our understanding of this two-component system. We expand the known target range, demonstrating Tpp49Aa1/Cry48Aa1 susceptibility of larvae from Anopheles stephensi, Aedes albopictus and Culex tarsalis - substantially increasing the potential use of this toxin pair in mosquito control. Further functional insights are gained using Culex cell lines to characterise cellular models for future investigations into Cry48Aa1/Tpp49Aa1 mechanism of action and to demonstrate transient detrimental effects of individual toxin components.\n\nSignificance StatementThe Tpp49Aa1/Cry48Aa1 protein pair kills mosquito larvae. Innovative use of nano-focused X-ray free electron laser to match the size of natural Tpp49Aa1 nanocrystals and the highest beam intensity available in any XFEL for high-throughput data collection, allowed structural resolution to 1.62 [A].\n\nTpp proteins show a range of interactions with different partners to elicit toxicity. To gain insight into Tpp49Aa1, its interaction with Cry48Aa1 was modelled. We also establish cell-based assays of Tpp49Aa1/Cry48Aa1 activity.\n\nWe expand the known target range to include three more mosquito species: Anopheles stephensi, Aedes albopictus and Culex tarsalis. This study will underpin future Tpp mode of action investigations and aid insecticide optimization against mosquito vectors of emerging diseases such as West Nile Virus and malaria.",

    "abstract": "For decades, it has been assumed that the foreign body response (FBR) to biomedical implants is primarily a reaction to the chemical and mechanical properties of the implant. Here, we show for the first time that a third independent variable, allometric tissue-scale forces (which increase exponentially with body size), can drive the biology of FBR in humans. We first demonstrate that pathological FBR in humans is mediated by immune cell-specific Rac2 mechanotransduction signaling, independent of implant chemistry or mechanical properties. We then show that mice, which are typically poor models of human FBR, can be made to induce a strikingly human-like pathological FBR by altering these extrinsic tissue forces. Altering these extrinsic tissue forces alone activates Rac2 signaling in a unique subpopulation of immune cells and results in a human-like pathological FBR at the molecular, cellular, and local tissue levels. Finally, we demonstrate that blocking Rac2 signaling negates the effect of increased tissue forces, dramatically reducing FBR. These findings highlight a previously unsuspected mechanism for pathological FBR and may have profound implications for the design and safety of all implantable devices in humans.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryAllometric tissue-scale forces at the implant-tissue interface drive pathological foreign body response.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is globally affecting rainfall patterns, necessitating the improvement of drought tolerance in crops. Sorghum bicolor is a drought-tolerant cereal capable of producing high yields under water scarcity conditions. Functional stay-green sorghum genotypes can maintain green leaf area and efficient grain filling in terminal post-flowering water deprivation, a period of ~10 weeks. To obtain molecular insights into these characteristics, two drought-tolerant genotypes, BTx642 and RTx430, were grown in control and terminal post-flowering drought field plots in the Central Valley of California. Photosynthetic, photoprotective, water dynamics, and biomass traits were quantified and correlated with metabolomic data collected from leaves, stems, and roots at multiple timepoints during drought. Physiological and metabolomic data was then compared to longitudinal RNA sequencing data collected from these two genotypes. The metabolic response to drought highlights the uniqueness of the post-flowering drought acclimation relative to pre-flowering drought. The functional stay-green genotype BTx642 specifically induced photoprotective responses in post-flowering drought supporting a putative role for photoprotection in the molecular basis of the functional stay-green trait. Specific genes are highlighted that may contribute to post-flowering drought tolerance and that can be targeted in crops to maximize yields under limited water input conditions.\n\nHighlightPathways contributing to the long-term maintenance of photosynthetic activity in terminal post-flowering drought are revealed by a comprehensive approach combining in-field photosynthetic physiological analysis, metabolomics, and transcriptomics.",

    "abstract": "In recent decades, chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have been successfully used to generate engineered T cells capable of recognizing and eliminating cancer cells. The structure of CARs frequently includes costimulatory domains, which enhance the T cell response upon antigen encounter. However, it is not fully known how the CAR co-stimulatory domains influence T cell activation in the presence of biological variability. In this work, we used mathematical modeling to elucidate how the inclusion of one such co-stimulatory molecule, CD28, impacts the response of a population of engineered T cells under different sources of variability. Particularly, our simulations demonstrate that CD28-bearing CARs mediate a faster and more consistent population response under both target antigen variability and kinetic rate variability. We identify kinetic parameters that have the most impact on mediating cell activation. Finally, based on our findings, we propose that enhancing the catalytic activity of lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) can result in drastically reduced and more consistent response times among heterogeneous CAR T cell populations.",

Caspase recruitment domain 9 (Card9), one of the IBD susceptibility genes, has been shown to protect against intestinal inflammation and fungal infection. However, the cell types and mechanisms involved in the CARD9 protective role against inflammation remain unknown.\n\nDesignWe used dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced and adoptive transfer colitis models in total and conditional CARD9 knock-out mice to uncover which cell types play a role in the CARD9 protective phenotype.

CARD9 expression in neutrophils, but not in epithelial or CD11c+ cells, protects against DSS-induced colitis. In the absence of CARD9, mitochondrial dysfunction in neutrophils leads to their premature death through apoptosis, especially in oxidative environment.

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis and its close relative Mycobacterium marinum infect macrophages and induce the formation of granulomas, organized macrophage-rich immune aggregates. These mycobacterial pathogens can accelerate and co-opt granuloma formation for their benefit, using the specialized secretion system ESX-1, a key virulence determinant. ESX-1-mediated virulence is attributed to the damage it causes to the membranes of macrophage phagosomal compartments, within which the bacteria reside. This phagosomal damage, in turn, has been attributed to the membranolytic activity of ESAT-6, the major secreted substrate of ESX-1. However, mutations that perturb ESAT- 6s membranolytic activity often result in global impairment of ESX-1 secretion. This has precluded an understanding of the causal and mechanistic relationships between ESAT-6 membranolysis and ESX-1-mediated virulence. Here, we identify two conserved residues in the unstructured C-terminal tail of ESAT-6 required for phagosomal damage, granuloma formation and virulence. Importantly, these ESAT-6 mutants have near- normal levels of secretion, far higher than the minimal threshold we establish is needed for ESX-1-mediated virulence early in infection. Unexpectedly, these loss-of-function ESAT-6 mutants retain the ability to lyse acidified liposomes. Thus, ESAT-6s virulence functions in vivo can be uncoupled from this in vitro surrogate assay. These uncoupling mutants highlight an enigmatic functional domain of ESAT-6 and provide key tools to investigate the mechanism of phagosomal damage and virulence.\n\nSignificance StatementTuberculosis (TB), an ancient disease of humanity, continues to be a major cause of worldwide death. The causative agent of TB, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and its close pathogenic relative Mycobacterium marinum, initially infect, evade, and exploit macrophages, a major host defense against invading pathogens. Within macrophages, mycobacteria reside within host membrane-bound compartments called phagosomes.\n\nMycobacterium-induced damage of the phagosomal membranes is integral to pathogenesis, and this activity has been attributed the specialized mycobacterial secretion system ESX-1, and particularly to ESAT-6, its major secreted protein. Here, we show that the integrity of the unstructured ESAT-6 C-terminus is required for macrophage phagosomal damage, granuloma formation, and virulence.",

A Gram-negative, pectinolytic bacterial strain PL65T isolated from an infected taro corm was subjected to polyphasic analysis to determine its genomic and phenotypic characteristics. Multi-locus sequence analyses (MLSA) based on five housekeeping genes (dnaA, gapA, gyrB, atpD, and purA) revealed that Dickeya zeae and D. oryzae, were the closest relatives. Phylogenetic analysis based on 463 core gene sequences clearly showed two potentially new species within Dickeya oryzae. In silico DNA- DNA hybridization value of strain PL65T with 12 Type strains of Dickeya species was <68%. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) analysis revealed that PL65T was at the margin of the species delineation cut-off values with a 96% ANI value. The metabolic profile of strain PL65T using BIOLOG differentiated it from the type strains of all other known species of Dickeya.

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) circulate throughout the body and carry cargo that can be conferred to proximal or distant cells, making them major delivery vehicles for cellular communication. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infected cells release EVs that contain viral proteins such as the major viral oncogene, latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). LMP1 has been shown to regulate the cellular gene expression of programmed cell death protein 1 ligand (PD-L1). PD-L1, a protein that suppresses the immune system by binding to PD-1, (a receptor found on cytotoxic T cells). PD-L1 has been recently found to be packaged into small EVs contributing to immune evasion of lung cancer cells. Recent studies establish that MVs are shed in very large amounts by tumor cells, and that elevated levels of MVs correlate to disease metastasis and cancers being more aggressive. Here, we demonstrate PD-L1 enrichment in MVs released from nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells and an important function of EBV LMP1 in regulating PD-L1 levels in MVs. These PD-L1+ MVs containing LMP1 likely contribute to the immunosuppressive microenvironment found in EBV-associated cancers.\n\nImportanceAccumulating evidence over the past decade supports that viruses utilize EVs and associated pathways to incorporate viral products to evade eliciting an immune response, while concurrently enabling viral spread or persistence within the host. Considering that viral proteins confer very strong antigenic peptides that will be recognized by T cells, the regulation of the PD-1 pathway by the overexpression of MV-associated PD-L1 may be a strong immune evasion tactic utilized by viruses. The discovery that EBV LMP1 increases PD-L1 microvesicle secretion, identifies a new therapeutic target in immune blockade therapy. We expect that our findings will begin to clarify the mechanism of LMP1-mediated enhanced packaging of PD-L1 into MVs and may produce more specific targets to treat EBV-associated cancers. Consequently, identifying whether a disease is of viral origin through predictive MV biomarkers could further allow for more targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Deep mutational scanning studies suggest that synonymous mutations are typically silent and that most exposed, non active-site residues are tolerant to mutations. Here we show that the ccdA antitoxin component of the E.coli ccdAB toxin-antitoxin system is unusually sensitive to mutations when studied in the operonic context. A large fraction ([~]80%) of single-codon mutations, including many synonymous mutations in the ccdA gene shows inactive phenotype, but they retain native-like binding affinity towards cognate toxin, CcdB. Therefore, the observed phenotypic effects are largely not due to alterations in protein structure/stability, consistent with a large region of CcdA being intrinsically disordered. E. coli codon preference and strength of ribosome-binding associated with translation of downstream ccdB gene are found to be major contributors of the observed mutant phenotypes. In select cases, proteomics studies reveal altered ratios of CcdA:CcdB protein levels in vivo, suggesting that the ccdA mutations likely alter relative translation efficiencies of the two genes in the operon. We extend these results by studying single-site synonymous mutations that lead to loss of function phenotypes in the relBE operon upon introduction of rarer codons. Thus, in their operonic context, genes are likely to be more sensitive to both synonymous and non-synonymous point mutations than inferred previously.",

Using CRISPR knockouts we find that RNA targets of HAX1 partially overlap with transcripts downregulated in HAX1 KO, implying a role in mRNA stabilization. Gene ontology analysis demonstrated that genes differentially expressed in HAX1 KO (including genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and translation) are also enriched in a subset of genes whose expression correlates with HAX1 expression in four analyzed neoplasms. Functional connection to ribosome biogenesis was also demonstrated by gradient sedimentation ribosome profiles, which revealed differences in the small subunit:monosome ratio in HAX1 WT/KO.

    "abstract": "Advances in experimental and theoretical work increasingly suggest that parasite interactions within a single host can affect the spread and severity of wildlife diseases. Yet empirical data to support predicted co-infection patterns are limited due to the practical challenges of gathering convincing data from animal populations and the stochastic nature of parasite transmission. Here, we investigated co-infection patterns between micro- (bacteria and protozoa) and macroparasites (gastrointestinal helminths) in natural populations of the multimammate mouse (Mastomys natalensis). Fieldwork was performed in Morogoro (Tanzania), where we trapped 211 individual M. natalensis and tested their behavior using a modified open-field arena. All animals were checked on the presence of helminths in their gastrointestinal tract, three bacteria (Anaplasma, Bartonella, and Borrelia) and two protozoan genera (Piroplasma and Hepatozoon). Besides the presence of eight different helminth genera (reported earlier), we found that 21% of M. natalensis were positive for Anaplasma, 13% for Bartonella, and 2% for Hepatozoon species. Hierarchical modelling of species communities was used to investigate the effect of the different host-related factors on these parasites infection probability and community structure. Our results show that the infection probability of Anaplasma and Bartonella was higher in adults than juveniles. We also observed that females and less explorative individuals had a higher infection probability with Bartonella. We found limited support for within-host interactions between micro-and macroparasites, as only animals infected with Bartonella were significantly more likely to be infected with Protospirura, Trichuris, and Trichostrongylidae helminths.",

    "abstract": "Wild reservoirs of Japanese encephalitis virus are under-studied globally, which presents critical knowledge gaps for JEV infection ecology despite decades of received wisdom regarding this high-impact mosquito-borne virus. As a result, ardeid birds, generally understood to be the primary reservoirs for JEV, as well as other waterbirds occupying landscapes at high risk for spillover to humans, are frequently ignored by current surveillance mechanisms and infrastructure. This is particularly true in India, which experiences a high annual burden of human outbreaks. Incorporating wild reservoirs into surveillance of human and livestock populations is therefore essential but will first require a data-driven approach to target individual host species. The current study sought to define a preliminary ecological profile of JEV hosts based on 1) species ecological traits, and 2) species presence and abundance adjusted for the biotic constraints of sympatry. Optimal host species tended to be generalists and demonstrate regionally-increasing populations. While ardeid bird species richness, abundance, and relative abundance did demonstrate the strongest and most consistent associations with the distribution of human JEV outbreaks, this study also identified several individual species among two other bird families in these landscapes, the Anatidae and the Rallidae, which also exhibited an optimal host profile and were strongly associated with the distribution of outbreaks. The findings from this work provide the first data-driven evidence base to inform wildlife sampling for the monitoring of JEV circulation in outbreak hotspots in India and thus identify good preliminary targets for the development of One Health wildlife JEV surveillance.",

    "abstract": "The relationships between adaptive evolution, phenotypic plasticity, and canalization remain incompletely understood. Theoretical and empirical studies have made conflicting arguments on whether adaptive evolution may enhance or oppose the plastic response. Gene regulatory traits offer excellent potential to study the relationship between plasticity and adaptation, and they can now be studied at the transcriptomic level. Here we take advantage of three closely-related pairs of natural populations of Drosophila melanogaster from contrasting thermal environments that reflect three separate instances of cold tolerance evolution. We measure the transcriptome-wide plasticity in gene expression levels and alternative splicing (intron usage) between warm and cold laboratory environments. We find that suspected adaptive changes in both gene expression and alternative splicing tend to neutralize the ancestral plastic response. Further, we investigate the hypothesis that adaptive evolution can lead to decanalization of selected gene regulatory traits. We find strong evidence that suspected adaptive gene expression (but not splicing) changes in cold-adapted populations are more vulnerable to the genetic perturbation of inbreeding than putatively neutral changes. We find some evidence that these patterns may reflect a loss of genetic canalization accompanying adaptation, although other processes including hitchhiking recessive deleterious variants may contribute as well. Our findings augment our understanding of genetic and environmental effects on gene regulation in the context of adaptive evolution.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is unclear whether adaptive evolution is concordant or discordant with regulatory plasticity, especially for splicing plasticity which is rarely studied. Here we analyzed RNA-seq data from three pairs of natural fly populations that represent separate adaptive evolution to cold climate. We found that adaptive evolution is generally discordant with the ancestral plasticity between cold and warm temperatures for gene expression abundance and splicing. We also investigate the hypothesis that adaptation leads to decanalization of the selected traits. By comparing the expression variance between inbred and outbred samples, we found evidence that adaptation may lead to genetic decanalization for expression abundance but not for splicing. Our study reveals the relationship between adaptation, plasticity and canalization in three instances in nature.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of sex determination (SD) mechanisms in teleost fishes is amazingly dynamic, as reflected by the variety of different master sex-determining genes identified, even sometimes among closely related species. Pangasiids are a group of economically important catfishes in many South-Asian countries, but little is known about their sex determination system. Here, we generated novel genomic resources for 12 Pangasiid species and provided a first characterization of their SD system. Based on an Oxford Nanopore long-read chromosome-scale high quality genome assembly of the striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, we identified a duplication of the anti-Mullerian hormone receptor type II gene (amhr2), which was further characterized as being sex-linked in males and expressed only in testicular samples. These first results point to a male-specific duplication on the Y chromosome (amhr2by) of the autosomal amhr2a. Sequence annotation revealed that the P. hypophthalmus Amhr2by is truncated in its N-terminal domain, lacking the cysteine-rich extracellular part of the receptor that is crucial for ligand binding, suggesting a potential route for its neofunctionalization. Short-read genome sequencing and reference-guided assembly of 11 additional Pangasiid species, along with sex-linkage studies, revealed that this truncated amhr2by duplication is also conserved as a male-specific gene in many Pangasiids. Reconstructions of the amhr2 phylogeny suggested that amhr2by arose from an ancient duplication / insertion event at the root of the Siluroidei radiation that is dated around 100 million years ago. Altogether these results bring multiple lines of evidence supporting that amhr2by is an ancient and conserved master sex-determining gene in Pangasiid catfishes, a finding that highlights the recurrent usage of the transforming growth factor {beta} pathway in teleost sex determination and brings another empirical case towards the understanding of the dynamics or stability of sex determination systems.",

Lineage-specific genes are often thought to represent genetic novelty that underlies unique adaptations. Identification of these genes depends not only on genome sequences, but also on inferred gene annotations. Comparative analyses typically use available genomes that have been annotated using different methods, increasing the risk that orthologous DNA sequences may be erroneously annotated as a gene in one species but not another, appearing lineage-specific as a result. To evaluate the impact of such \"annotation heterogeneity,\" we identified four clades of species with sequenced genomes with more than one publicly available gene annotation, allowing us to compare the number of lineage-specific genes inferred when differing annotation methods are used to those resulting when annotation method is uniform across the clade. In these case studies, annotation heterogeneity increases the apparent number of lineage-specific genes by up to 15-fold, suggesting that annotation heterogeneity is a substantial source of potential artifact.",

Here, we created HIV-specific CAR-T cells using human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and a 3BNC117-E27 CAR (3BE CAR) construct that enables the expression of PD-1 blocking scFv E27 and the single-chain variable fragment of the HIV-1-specific broadly neutralizing antibody 3BNC117 to target native HIV envelope glycoprotein (Env). In comparison with T cells expressing 3BNC117-CAR alone, 3BE CAR-T cells showed greater anti-HIV potency with stronger proliferation capability, higher killing efficiency (up to ~75%) and enhanced cytokine secretion in the presence of HIV envelope glycoprotein-expressing cells. Furthermore, our approach achieved high levels (over 97%) of the TCR-deficient 3BE CAR-T cells with the functional inactivation of endogenous TCR to avoid graft-versus-host disease without compromising their antiviral activity relative to standard anti-HIV CAR-T cells.

    "abstract": "BackgroundLarge scale metagenome assembly and binning to generate metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) has become possible in the past five years. As a result, millions of MAGs have been produced and increasingly included in pan-genomics workflow. However, pan-genome analyses of MAGs may suffer from the known issues with MAGs: fragmentation, incompleteness, and contamination, due to mis-assembly and mis-binning. Here, we conducted a critical assessment of including MAGs in pan-genome analysis, by comparing pan-genome analysis results of complete bacterial genomes and simulated MAGs.\n\nResultsWe found that incompleteness led to more significant core gene loss than fragmentation. Contamination had little effect on core genome size but had major influence on accessory genomes. The core gene loss remained when using different pan-genome analysis tools and when using a mixture of MAGs and complete genomes. Importantly, the core gene loss was partially alleviated by lowering the core gene threshold and using gene prediction algorithms that consider fragmented genes, but to a less degree when incompleteness was higher than 5%. The core gene loss also led to incorrect pan-genome functional predictions and inaccurate phylogenetic trees.\n\nConclusionsWe conclude that lowering core gene threshold and predicting genes in metagenome mode (as Anvio does with Prodigal) are necessary in pan-genome analysis of MAGs to alleviate the accuracy loss. Better quality control of MAGs and development of new pan-genome analysis tools specifically designed for MAGs are needed in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) play critical roles in regulatory protein interactions, but detailed structural/dynamics characterization of their ensembles remain challenging, both in isolation and they form dynamic  fuzzy complexes. Such is the case for mRNA cap-dependent translation initiation, which is regulated by the interaction of the predominantly folded eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) with the intrinsically disordered eIF4E binding proteins (4E-BPs) in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Single-molecule Forster resonance energy transfer showed that the conformational changes of 4E-BP2 induced by binding to eIF4E are non-uniform along the sequence; while a central region containing both motifs that bind to eIF4E expands and becomes stiffer, the C-terminal region is less affected. Fluorescence anisotropy decay revealed a nonuniform segmental flexibility around six different labelling sites along the chain. Dynamic quenching of these fluorescent probes by intrinsic aromatic residues measured via fluorescence correlation spectroscopy report on transient intra- and inter-molecular contacts on ns-s timescales. Upon hyperphosphorylation, which induces folding of ~40 residues in 4E-BP2, the quenching rates decreased at most labelling sites. The chain dynamics around sites in the C-terminal region far away from the two binding motifs significantly increased upon binding to eIF4E, suggesting that this region is also involved in the highly dynamic 4E-BP2:eIF4E complex. Our time-resolved fluorescence data paint a sequence-level rigidity map of three states of 4E-BP2 differing in phosphorylation or binding status and distinguish regions that form contacts with eIF4E. This study adds complementary structural and dynamics information to recent studies of 4E-BP2, and it constitutes an important step towards a mechanistic understanding of this important IDP via integrative modelling.",

    "abstract": "Ehrlichia chaffeensis evades innate host defenses by reprogramming the mononuclear phagocyte through mechanisms that involve exploitation of multiple evolutionarily conserved cellular signaling pathways including Notch. This immune evasion strategy is directed in part by tandem repeat protein (TRP) effectors. Specifically, the TRP120 effector activates and regulates Notch signaling through interactions with the Notch receptor and the negative regulator, F-Box and WD repeat domain-containing 7 (FBW7). However, the specific molecular interactions and motifs required for E. chaffeensis TRP120-Notch receptor interaction and activation have not been defined. To investigate the molecular basis of TRP120 Notch activation, we compared TRP120 with endogenous canonical/non-canonical Notch ligands and identified a short region of sequence homology within the tandem repeat (TR) domain. TRP120 was predicted to share biological function with Notch ligands, and a function-associated sequence in the TR domain was identified. To investigate TRP120-Notch receptor interactions, colocalization between TRP120 and endogenous Notch-1 was observed. Moreover, direct interactions between full length TRP120, the TRP120 TR domain containing the putative Notch ligand sequence, and the Notch receptor LBR were demonstrated. To molecularly define the TRP120 Notch activation motif, peptide mapping was used to identify an 11-amino acid short linear motif (SLiM) located within the TRP120 TR that activated Notch signaling and downstream gene expression. Peptide mutants of the Notch SLiM or anti-Notch SLiM antibody reduced or eliminated Notch activation and NICD nuclear translocation. This investigation reveals a novel molecularly defined pathogen encoded Notch SLiM mimetic that activates Notch signaling consistent with endogenous ligands.\n\nImportanceE. chaffeensis infects and replicates in mononuclear phagocytes, but how it evades innate immune defenses of this indispensable primary innate immune cell is not well understood. This investigation reveals the molecular details of a ligand mimicry cellular reprogramming strategy that involves a short linear motif (SLiM) which enables E. chaffeensis to exploit host cell signaling to establish and maintain infection. E. chaffeensis TRP120 is a moonlighting effector that has been associated with cellular activation and other functions including ubiquitin ligase activity. Herein, we identify and demonstrate that a SLiM present within each tandem repeat of TRP120 activates Notch signaling. Notch is an evolutionarily conserved signaling pathway responsible for many cell functions including cell fate, development, and innate immunity. The proposed study is significant because it reveals the first molecularly defined pathogen encoded SLiM that appears to have evolved de novo to mimic endogenous Notch ligands. Understanding Notch activation during E. chaffeensis infection provides a model in which to study pathogen exploitation of signaling pathways and will be useful in developing molecularly-targeted countermeasures for inhibiting infection by a multitude of disease-causing pathogens that exploit cell signaling through molecular mimicry.\n\nAuthor SummaryE. chaffeensis is a small, obligately intracellular, Gram-negative bacterium that has evolved cellular reprogramming strategies to subvert innate defenses of the mononuclear phagocyte. Ehrlichial TRP effectors interface with the host cell and are involved in pathogen-host interplay that facilitates exploitation and manipulation of cellular signaling pathways; however, the molecular interactions and functional outcomes are not well understood. This study provides molecular insight into a eukaryotic mimicry strategy whereby secreted effectors of obligately intracellular pathogens activate the evolutionarily conserved Notch signaling pathway through a short linear motif ligand mimetic to promote intracellular infection and survival.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (TACS) is commonly used to synchronise the output of a cortical area to other parts of the nervous system, but evidence for this based on brain recordings in humans is challenging. The brain transmits beta oscillations (~21Hz) to tonically contracted limb muscles linearly and through the fastest corticospinal pathways. Therefore, muscle activity may be used as a proxy measure for the level of beta entrainment in the corticospinal tract due to TACS over motor cortex. Here, we assessed if TACS is able to modulate the neural inputs to muscles, which would provide an indirect evidence for TACS-driven neural entrainment. In the first part of this study, we ran a series of simulations of motor neuron (MN) pools receiving inputs from corticospinal neurons with different levels of beta entrainment. Results indicated that MNs should be highly sensitive to changes in corticospinal beta activity. Then, we ran experiments on healthy human subjects (N=10) in which TACS (at 1mA) was delivered over the motor cortex at 21Hz (beta stimulation), or at 7Hz or 40Hz (control conditions) while the abductor digiti minimi (ADM) or the tibialis anterior muscle (TA) were tonically contracted. Muscle activity was measured using high-density electromyography, which allowed us to decompose the spiking activity of pools of motor units innervating the studied muscles. By analysing motor unit pool activity, we observed that none of the tested TACS conditions could consistently alter the spectral characteristics of the common neural inputs received by the muscles. These results suggest that 1mA-TACS over motor cortex given at frequencies in the beta band does not affect corticospinal beta entrainment.\n\nHighlights- TACS is commonly used to entrain the communication between brain regions\n- It is challenging to find direct evidence supporting TACS-driven neural entrainment\n- Simulations show that motor neurons are sensitive to corticospinal beta entrainment\n- Motor unit activity from human muscles does not support TACS-driven entrainment",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFragile X syndrome (FXS), the most prevalent inherited intellectual disability and one of the most common monogenic form of autism, is caused by a loss of FMRP translational regulator 1 (FMR1). We have previously shown that FMR1 represses the levels and activities of ubiquitin ligase MDM2 in young adult FMR1-deficient mice and treatment by a MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3 rescues both hippocampal neurogenic and cognitive deficits in FMR1-deficient mice when analyzed shortly after the administration. However, it is unknown whether Nutlin-3 treatment can have long-lasting therapeutic effects.\n\nMethodsWe treated 2-month-old young adult FMR1-deficient mice with Nutlin-3 for 10 days and then assessed the persistent effect of Nutlin-3 on both cognitive functions and adult neurogenesis when mice were 6-month-old mature adults. To investigate the mechanisms underlying persistent effects of Nutlin-3, we analyzed proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells isolated from these mice and assessed the transcriptome of the hippocampal tissues of treated mice.\n\nResultsWe found that transient treatment with Nutlin-3 of 2-month-old young adult FMR1-deficient mice prevents the emergence of neurogenic and cognitive deficits in mature adult FXS mice at 6-month of age. We further found that the long-lasting restoration of neurogenesis and cognitive function might not be mediated by changing intrinsic properties of adult neural stem cells. Transcriptomic analysis of the hippocampal tissue demonstrated that transient Nultin-3 treatment leads to significant expression changes in genes related to extracellular matrix, secreted factors, and cell membrane proteins in FMR1-deficient hippocampus.\n\nConclusionsOur data indicates that transient Nutlin-3 treatment in young adults leads to long-lasting neurogenic and behavioral changes through modulating adult neurogenic niche rather than intrinsic properties of adult neural stem cells. Our results demonstrate that cognitive impairments in FXS may be prevented by an early intervention through Nutlin-3 treatment.",

    "abstract": "Hexanucleotide G4C2 repeat expansions in the C9ORF72 gene are the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Dipeptide repeat proteins (DPRs) generated by translation of repeat-containing RNAs show toxic effects in vivo as well as in vitro and are key targets for therapeutic intervention. We generated human antibodies that bind DPRs with high affinity and specificity. Anti-GA antibodies engaged extra- and intracellular poly-GA and reduced aggregate formation in a poly-GA over-expressing human cell line. However, antibody treatment in human neuronal cultures synthesizing exogenous poly-GA resulted in the formation of large extracellular immune complexes and did not affect accumulation of intracellular poly-GA aggregates. Treatment with antibodies was also shown to directly alter the morphological and biochemical properties of poly-GA and to shift poly-GA/antibody complexes to more rapidly sedimenting ones. These alterations were not observed with poly-GP and have important implications for accurate measurement of poly-GA levels including the need to evaluate all centrifugation fractions and disrupt the interaction between treatment antibodies and poly-GA by denaturation. Targeting poly-GA and poly-GP in two mouse models expressing G4C2 repeats by systemic antibody delivery for up to 16 months was well-tolerated and led to measurable brain penetration of antibodies. Long term treatment with anti-GA antibodies produced improvement in an open field movement test in aged C9ORF72450 mice. However, chronic administration of anti-GA antibodies in AAV-(G4C2)149 mice was associated with increased levels of poly-GA detected by immunoassay and did not significantly reduce poly-GA aggregates or alleviate disease progression in this model.\n\nSignificanceImmunotherapy has been proposed for neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers or Parkinsons diseases. Recent reports using antibodies against poly-GA or active immunization suggested similar immunotherapy in ALS/FTD caused by repeat expansion in the C9ORF72 gene (1, 2). Here, we systematically characterized human antibodies against multiple DPR species and tested the biological effects of antibodies targeting poly-GA in different cellular and mouse models. Target engagement was shown in three independent cellular models. Anti-GA antibodies reduced the number of intracellular poly-GA aggregates in human T98G cells but not in cultured human neurons. Whereas chronic anti-GA treatment in BAC C9ORF72450 mice did not impact poly-GA levels and modestly improved one behavioral phenotype, poly-GA levels detected by immunoassays were increased and disease progression was unaltered in AAV-(G4C2)149 mice.",

    "abstract": "Chemotherapy is often dose limiting due to the emergence of a debilitating neuropathy. IL-10 and IL-4 are protective against peripheral neuropathy, yet the cell source is unknown. Using flow cytometry, we found that naive females had a greater frequency of anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cells in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) than males. In response to paclitaxel, females had reduced hypersensitivity and a greater frequency of anti-inflammatory CD4+ T cells (FoxP3, IL-10, IL-4) in the DRG than ovariectomized and male mice.

Here, we pave the way towards this goal by analyzing conserved druggable virus-host interactions, mechanisms of action and immunomodulatory properties of broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAs), routes of BSA delivery, and BSA interactions with other antivirals. Based on the analysis we developed scoring systems, which allowed us to predict novel BSAs and BSA-containing drug combinations (BCCs).

    "abstract": "Atmospheric nitrous oxide (N2O) is a potent greenhouse gas thought to be mainly derived from microbial metabolism as part of the denitrification pathway. Here, we report that in unexplored peat soils of Central and South America, N2O production can be driven by abiotic reactions ([&le;] 98 %) highly competitive to their enzymatic counterparts. Extracted soil iron positively correlated with in-situ abiotic N2O production determined by isotopic tracers. Moreover, we found that microbial N2O reduction accompanied abiotic production, essentially closing a coupled abiotic-biotic N2O cycle. Anaerobic N2O consumption occurred ubiquitously (pH 6.4-3.7), with proportions of diverse clade II N2O-reducers increasing with consumption rates. Our findings show denitrification in tropical peat soils is not a purely biological process, but rather a \"mosaic\" of abiotic and biotic reduction reactions. We predict hydrological and temperature fluctuations differentially affect abiotic and biotic drivers and further contribute to the high N2O flux variation in the region.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas has revolutionized genome editing and has a great potential for applications, such as correcting human genetic disorders. To increase the safety of genome editing applications, CRISPR-Cas may benefit from strict control over Cas enzyme activity. Previously, anti-CRISPR proteins and designed oligonucleotides have been proposed to modulate CRISPR-Cas activity. Here we report on the potential of guide-complementary DNA oligonucleotides as controlled inhibitors of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein complexes. First, we show that DNA oligonucleotides down-regulate Cas9 activity in human cells, reducing both on and off-target cleavage. We then used in vitro assays to better understand how inhibition is achieved and under which conditions. Two factors were found to be important for robust inhibition: the length of the complementary region, and the presence of a PAM-loop on the inhibitor. We conclude that DNA oligonucleotides can be used to effectively inhibit Cas9 activity both ex vivo and in vitro.",

However, techniques that monitor the in situ TF-promoter interactions in living bacteria are lacking. Herein, we developed a whole-cell TF-promoter binding assay based on the intermolecular Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a fluorescent unnatural amino acid CouA which is genetically encoded into defined sites in TFs and the live cell fluorescent nucleic acid stain SYTO 9. We show that this new FRET pair monitors the intricate TF-promoter interactions elicited by various types of signal transduction systems with specificity and sensitivity. Furthermore, the assay is applicable to identify novel modulators of the regulatory systems of interest and monitor TF activities in bacteria colonized in C. elegans. In conclusion, we established a tractable and sensitive TF-promoter binding assay in living bacteria which not only complements currently available approaches for DNA-protein interactions but also provides novel opportunities for functional annotation of bacterial signal transduction systems and studies of the bacteria-host interface.",

Field studies of model species groups help reveal the roles of these factors. Species of Caenorhabditis nematodes are highly divergent at the sequence level but exhibit highly conserved morphological uniformity, and many of these species live in sympatry on microbe-rich patches of rotten material. Here, we use field experiments and large-scale opportunistic collections to investigate species composition, abundance, and colonization efficiency of Caenorhabditis in two of the worlds best studied lowland tropical field sites: Barro Colorado Island in Panama and La Selva in Sarapiqui, Costa Rica. We observed seven species of Caenorhabditis, four of them known only from these collections. While these localities contain species from many parts of the phylogeny, both localities were dominated by globally distributed androdiecious species. We found that Caenorhabditis were able to colonize baits accessible only by phoresy, preferring to colonize baits making direct contact with the ground. We estimate founder numbers per colonization event to be low.",

Here we present the first published estimates of genome size of the ecologically and economically important ectoparasite, Lepeophtheirus salmonis (Copepoda, Caligidae). Four independent L. salmonis genome assemblies of the North Atlantic subspecies Lepeophtheirus salmonis salmonis, including two chromosome level assemblies, yield assemblies ranging from 665 - 790 Mbps. These genome assemblies are congruent in their findings, and appear very complete with Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs analyses finding >92% of expected genes and transcriptome datasets routinely mapping >90% of reads. However, two cytometric techniques, flow cytometry and Feulgen image analysis densitometry, yield measurements of 1.3-1.6 Gb in the haploid genome. Interestingly, earlier cytometric measurements reported genome sizes of 939 and 567 Mbps in L. salmonis salmonis samples from Bay of Fundy and Norway, respectively. Available data thus suggest that the genome sizes of salmon lice are variable. Current understanding of eukaryotic genome dynamics suggests that the most likely explanation for such variability involves repetitive DNA, which for L. salmonis makes up {approx}60% of the genome assemblies.",

However, the impact of sexual reproduction has remained unclear. Here, we show that meiosis in A. fumigatus involves the highest known recombination rate, producing ~29 crossovers per chromosome. This represents the highest known crossover rate for any Eukaryotic species. We validate this recombination rate by mapping resistance to acriflavine, a common genetic marker. We further show that this recombination rate can produce the commonly encountered TR34/L98H azole-resistant cyp51A haplotype in each sexual event, facilitating its rapid and global spread. Understanding the consequences of this unparalleled crossover rate will not only enrich our genetic understanding of this emergent human pathogen, but of meiosis in general.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryGenetic exchange between chromosomes during sex in Aspergillus fumigatus is higher than in any other known organism.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulation plays a critical role in many neurodevelopmental disorders, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). In particular, many such disorders are the result of mutations in genes that encode chromatin modifying proteins. However, while these disorders share many features, it is unclear whether they also share gene expression disruptions resulting from the aberrant regulation of chromatin. We examined 5 chromatin modifiers that are all linked to ASD despite their different roles in regulating chromatin. Specifically, we depleted Ash1L, Chd8, Crebbp, Ehmtl, and Nsd1 in parallel in a highly controlled neuronal culture system. We then identified sets of shared genes, or transcriptional signatures, that are differentially expressed following loss of multiple ASD-linked chromatin modifiers. We examined the functions of genes within the transcriptional signatures and found an enrichment in many neurotransmitter transport genes and activity-dependent genes. In addition, these genes are enriched for specific chromatin features such as bivalent domains that allow for highly dynamic regulation of gene expression. The downregulated transcriptional signature is also observed within multiple mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders that result in ASD, but not those only associated with intellectual disability. Finally, the downregulated transcriptional signature can distinguish between neurons generated from iPSCs derived from healthy donors and idiopathic ASD patients through RNA-deconvolution, demonstrating that this gene set is relevant to the human disorder. This work identifies a transcriptional signature that is found within many neurodevelopmental syndromes, helping to elucidate the link between epigenetic regulation and the underlying cellular mechanisms that result in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Translation is a highly energy consumptive process1 tightly regulated for optimal protein quality2 and adaptation to energy and nutrient availability. A key facilitator of this process is the -kinase eEF-2K that specifically phosphorylates the GTP-dependent translocase eEF-2, thereby reducing its affinity for the ribosome and suppressing the elongation phase of protein synthesis3,4. eEF-2K activation requires calmodulin binding and auto-phosphorylation at the primary stimulatory site, T348. Biochemical studies have predicted that calmodulin activates eEF-2K through a unique allosteric process5 mechanistically distinct from other calmodulin-dependent kinases6. Here we resolve the atomic details of this mechanism through a 2.3 [A] crystal structure of the heterodimeric complex of calmodulin with the functional core of eEF-2K (eEF-2KTR). This structure, which represents the activated T348-phosphorylated state of eEF-2KTR, highlights how through an intimate association with the calmodulin C-lobe, the kinase creates a \"spine\" that extends from its N-terminal calmodulin-targeting motif through a conserved regulatory element to its active site. Modification of key spine residues has deleterious functional consequences.",

We constructed drug target networks (DTNs) and examined their enrichment among genes in disease A/B PPI networks, expressed across 53 tissues and involved in ~1000 pathways. To pinpoint the biological features characterizing the DTNs, we performed principal component analysis and computed the Euclidean distance between DTN component scores and feature loading values. DTNs of disease A drugs not contraindicated in B were affiliated with proteins common to A/B networks or uniquely found in the B network, similarly regulated common pathways, and disease-B specific pathways and tissues. DTNs of disease A drugs contraindicated in B were affiliated with common proteins or those uniquely found in the A network, differentially regulated common pathways, and disease A-specific pathways and tissues.

    "abstract": "Proximity pharmacology (ProxPharm) is a novel paradigm in drug discovery where a small molecule brings two proteins in close proximity to elicit a signal, generally from one protein onto another. The potential of ProxPharm compounds as a new therapeutic modality is firmly established by proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that bring an E3 ubiquitin ligase in proximity to a target protein to induce ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of the target protein. The concept can be expanded to induce other post-translational modifications via the recruitment of different types of protein-modifying enzymes. To survey the human proteome for opportunities in proximity pharmacology, we systematically mapped non-catalytic drug binding pockets on the structure of protein-modifying enzymes available from the Protein Databank. In addition to binding sites exploited by previously reported ProxPharm compounds, we identified putative ligandable non-catalytic pockets in 188 kinases, 42 phosphatases, 26 deubiquitinases, 9 methyltransferases, 7 acetyltransferases, 7 glycosyltransferases, 4 deacetylases, 3 demethylases and 2 glycosidases, including cavities occupied by chemical matter that may serve as starting points for future ProxPharm compounds.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe use of shotgun metagenomics for AMR detection is appealing because data can be generated from clinical samples with minimal processing. Detecting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in clinical genomic data is an important epidemiological task, yet a complex bioinformatic process. Many software tools exist to detect AMR genes, but they have mostly been tested in their detection of genotypic resistance in individual bacterial strains. Further, these tools use different databases, or even different versions of the same databases. Understanding the comparative performance of these bioinformatics tools for AMR gene detection in shotgun metagenomic data is important because this data type is increasingly used in public health and clinical settings.\n\nMethodsWe developed a software pipeline, hAMRoaster (Harmonized AMR Output compAriSon Tool ER; https://github.com/ewissel/hAMRoaster), for assessing accuracy of prediction of antibiotic resistance phenotypes. For evaluation purposes, we simulated a highly resistant mock community and several low resistance metagenomic short read (Illumina) samples based on sequenced strains with known phenotypes. We benchmarked nine open source bioinformatics tools for detecting AMR genes that 1) were conda or Docker installable, 2) had been actively maintained, 3) had an open source license, and 4) took FASTA or FASTQ files as input. hAMRoaster calculated sensitivity, specificity, precision, and accuracy for each tool, comparing detected AMR genes to susceptibility testing.\n\nConclusionOverall, all tools were precise and accurate at all genome coverage levels tested (5x, 50x, 100x sequenced bases / genome length) in the highly resistant mock community with more variability in the low resistance community (1x coverage). This study demonstrated that different bioinformatic tools and pipelines yield differences in AMR gene identification across drug classes, and that these differences become important if researchers are interested in resistance to specific drug classes.\n\nSignificanceSoftware selection for metagenomic AMR prediction should be driven by the context of the clinical/research questions and tolerance for true and false negative results. The ability to assess which bioinformatics tool best fits a particular dataset prior to beginning a large-scale project allows for more efficient processing and analysis using optimal tools for a particular research question. As prediction software and databases are in a state of constant refinement, the approach used here--creating synthetic communities containing taxa and phenotypes of interest along with using hAMRoaster to assess performance of candidate software--offers a template to aid researchers in selecting the most appropriate strategy at the time of analysis.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial microcompartments are substrate specific metabolic modules that are conditionally expressed in certain bacterial species. These all protein structures have size in the range of 100-150 nm and are formed by the self-assembly of thousands of protein subunits, all encoded by genes belonging to a single operon. The operon contains genes that encode for both enzymes and shell proteins. The shell proteins self-assemble to form the outer coat of the compartment and enzymes are encapsulated within. A perplexing question in MCP biology is to understand the mechanism which governs the formation of these small yet complex assemblages of proteins. In this work we use 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartments (PduMCP) as a paradigm to identify the factors that drive the self-assembly of MCP proteins. We find that a major shell protein PduBB tend to self-assemble under macromolecular crowded environment and suitable ionic strength. Microscopic visualization and biophysical studies reveal phase separation to be the principle mechanism behind the self-association of shell protein in the presence of salts and macromolecular crowding. The shell protein PduBB interacts with the enzyme diol-dehydratase PduCDE and co-assemble into phase separated liquid droplets. The co-assembly of PduCDE and PduBB results in the enhancement of catalytic activity of the enzyme. A combination of spectroscopic and biochemical techniques shows the relevance of divalent cation Mg2+ in providing stability to intact PduMCP in vivo. Together our results suggest a combination of protein-protein interactions and phase separation guiding the self-assembly of Pdu shell protein and enzyme in solution phase.\n\nSignificance StatementPresent work shows how surrounding environment modulates the self-assembly behavior of a major shell protein of 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment (PduMCP). Appropriate ionic strength and macromolecular crowding bring about liquid-liquid phase separation of the shell protein. Under crowded environment Mg2+ displayed unique property to drive the formation of shell protein liquid condensates. The co-phase separation of a native enzyme along with the shell protein enables it to outperform the enzyme in isolation. This adds on to the existing concept of phase separation being the underlying principle behind the genesis of lipid free organelles in prokaryotes. Further, our results indicate that the divalent metal ion Mg2+ plays an intricate role in the outfitting of the structure-function integrity of PduMCPs.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476392v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (48K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b95271org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d3a5b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2432eaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8aad07_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Circadian Clock (CC) drives the normal cell cycle and reciprocally regulates telomere elongation. However, it can be deregulated in cancer, embryonic stem cells (ESC), and the early embryo. Here, its role in the resistance of cancer cells to genotoxic treatments was assessed in relation to whole-genome duplication (WGD) and telomere regulation. We first evaluated the DNA damage response of polyploid cancer cells and observed a similar impact on the cell cycle to that seen in ESC - overcoming G1/S, adapting DNA damage checkpoints, tolerating DNA damage, and coupling telomere erosion to accelerated cell senescence, favouring transition by mitotic slippage into the ploidy cycle (reversible polyploidy). Next, we revealed a positive correlation between cancer WGD and deregulation of CC assessed by bioinformatics on 11 primary cancer datasets (rho=0.83; p<0.01). As previously shown, the cancer cells undergoing mitotic slippage cast off telomere fragments with TERT, restore the telomeres by recombination and return their depolyploidised mitotic offspring to TERT-dependent telomere regulation. Through depolyploidisation and the CC \"death loop\" the telomeres and Hayflick limit count are thus again renewed. This mechanism along with similar inactivity of the CC in early embryos support a life-cycle (embryonic) concept of cancer.",

    "abstract": "Defects in mitochondrial function and mitochondrial-related redox deregulation have been attributed to Huntingtons disease (HD), a genetic neurodegenerative disorder largely affecting the striatum. However, whether these changes occur in early stages of the disease and can be detected in vivo is still unclear. Thus, in the present study, we analyzed changes in mitochondrial function and overreduced states associated with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at early stages and along disease progression. Studies were performed in vivo in human brain using positron emission tomography (PET) using [64Cu]-ATSM and ex vivo in human skin fibroblasts of premanifest and prodromal (Pre-M) and manifest HD patients; in vivo brain [64Cu]-ATSM PET and isolated mitochondria derived from striatum and cortex were also analyzed in YAC128 transgenic mouse at pre-symptomatic (3 month-old, mo) and symptomatic (6 to 12 mo) stages. Oxygen consumption rates were assessed by Seahorse analysis, hydrogen peroxide levels were determined using fluorescent probes and mitochondrial morphology by transmission electron microscopy in human skin fibroblasts and mouse striatal and cortical isolated mitochondria. Pre-M HD carriers exhibited enhanced whole-brain (with exception of caudate) [64Cu]-ATSM labelling, correlating with CAG repeat number. Fibroblasts from Pre-M showed enhanced basal and maximal respiration, proton (H+) leak and increased hydrogen peroxide levels, the later progressing to manifest HD; mitochondria from fibroblasts of Pre-M HD carriers also showed reduced roundness, while higher number of mitochondrial DNA copies correlated with maximal respiratory capacity. In vivo animal PET analysis showed increased accumulation of [64Cu]-ATSM in YAC128 mouse striatum. Pre-symptomatic YAC128 mouse striatal isolated mitochondria exhibited a rise in basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration and in ATP production, along with increased complex II and III activities; mouse HD mitochondria also showed enhanced mitochondrial hydrogen peroxide levels and roundness, as revealed by brain ultrastructure analysis, and defects in Ca2+ handling, supporting increased striatal susceptibility in YAC128 mouse brain. Data demonstrate both human and mouse mitochondrial overactivity and altered morphology at early HD stages, facilitating redox unbalance, the latter extending over manifest disease stages.",

    "abstract": "Despite the essential role of plasma cells in health and disease, the cellular mechanisms controlling their survival and secretory capacity are still poorly understood. Here, we identified the SNARE Sec22b as a unique and critical regulator of plasma cell maintenance and function. In absence of Sec22b, plasma cells were barely detectable and serum antibody titres were dramatically reduced. Accordingly, Sec22b deficient mice fail to mount a protective immune response. At the mechanistic level, we demonstrated that Sec22b is indispensable for efficient antibody secretion but also for plasma cell fitness through the regulation of the morphology of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Altogether, our results unveil a critical role for Sec22b-mediated regulation of plasma cell biology through the control of organelle dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants (SVs) can promote speciation by directly causing reproductive isolation or by suppressing recombination across large genomic regions. Whereas examples of each mechanism have been documented, systematic tests of the role of SVs in speciation are lacking. Here, we take advantage of long-read (Oxford nanopore) whole-genome sequencing and a hybrid zone between two Lycaeides butterfly taxa (L. melissa and Jackson Hole Lycaeides) to comprehensively evaluate genome-wide patterns of introgression for SVs and relate these patterns to hypotheses about speciation. We found >100,000 SVs segregating within or between the two hybridizing species. SVs and SNPs exhibited similar levels of genetic differentiation between species, with the exception of inversions, which were more differentiated. We detected credible variation in patterns of introgression among SV loci in the hybrid zone, with 562 of 1419 ancestry-informative SVs exhibiting genomic clines that deviating from null expectations based on genome-average ancestry. Overall, hybrids exhibited a directional shift towards Jackson Hole Lycaeides ancestry at SV loci, consistent with the hypothesis that these loci experienced more selection on average then SNP loci. Surprisingly, we found that deletions, rather than inversions, showed the highest skew towards excess introgression from Jackson Hole Lycaeides. Excess Jackson Hole Lycaeides ancestry in hybrids was also especially pronounced for Z-linked SVs and inversions containing many genes. In conclusion, our results show that SVs are ubiquitous and suggest that SVs in general, but especially deletions, might contribute disproportionately to hybrid fitness and thus (partial) reproductive isolation.",

    "abstract": "Femtosecond lasers are capable of precise ablation that produce surgical dissections in vivo. The transverse and axial resolution of the laser damage inside the bulk are important parameters of ablation. The transverse resolution is routinely quantified, but the axial resolution is more difficult to measure and is less commonly performed. In some in vivo samples, fine dissections can also be difficult to visualize, but in vitro samples may allow clear imaging. Using a 1040-nm, 400-fs pulsed laser, we performed ablation inside agarose and glass, producing clear and persistent damage spots. Near the ablation threshold of both media, we found that the axial resolution is similar to the transverse resolution. We also ablated neuron cell bodies and fibers in C. elegans and demonstrate submicrometer resolution in both the transverse and axial directions, consistent with our results in agarose and glass. Using simple yet rigorous methods, we define the resolution of laser ablation in transparent media along all directions.",
