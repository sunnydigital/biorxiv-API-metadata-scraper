    "abstract": "The Type VII secretion system (T7SS) is found in many Gram-positive firmicutes and secretes protein toxins that mediate bacterial antagonism. Two T7SS toxins have been identified in Staphylococcus aureus, EsaD a nuclease toxin that is counteracted by the EsaG immunity protein, and TspA, which has membrane depolarising activity and is neutralised by TsaI. Both toxins are polymorphic, and strings of non-identical esaG and tsaI immunity genes are encoded in all S. aureus strains. To investigate the evolution of esaG repertoires, we analysed the sequences of the tandem esaG genes and their encoded proteins. We identified three blocks of high sequence similarity shared by all esaG genes and identified evidence of extensive recombination events between esaG paralogues facilitated through these conserved sequence blocks. Recombination between these blocks accounts for loss and expansion of esaG genes in S. aureus genomes and we identified evidence of such events during evolution of strains in clonal complex 8. TipC, an immunity protein for the TelC lipid II phosphatase toxin secreted by the streptococcal T7SS, is also encoded by multiple gene paralogues. Two blocks of high sequence similarity locate to the 5 and 3 end of tipC genes, and we found strong evidence for recombination between tipC paralogues encoded by Streptococcus mitis BCC08. By contrast, we found only a single homology block across tsaI genes, and little evidence for intergenic recombination within this gene family. We conclude that homologous recombination is one of the drivers for the evolution of T7SS immunity gene clusters.\n\nDATA SUMMARYAll sequence data for strains used in this study are available on NCBI under BioProject PRJNA789916. Sequences from the NCTC3000 project are available on NCBI under BioProject PRJEB6403. Supplementary data 2 and all custom scripts are available on Github: https://github.com/GM110Z/Garret-et-al.-recombination-paper.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTThe type VII secretion system (T7SS) in firmicutes secretes polymorphic toxins that target other bacteria. To protect from the action of these toxins, bacteria carry multiple paralogous copies of immunity protein-encoding genes that are sequence-related but non-identical. To date, little is known about how T7 immunity gene families evolve. In this study we analysed a cluster of EsaG-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus which are found at the ess/T7 secretion locus and provide immunity against the T7 secreted nuclease toxin, EsaD. We identified three homology blocks covering esaG genes and their downstream intergenic regions, which are separated by two variable regions. We have shown that recombination can occur between these homology blocks, leading to loss or expansion of esaG genes at this locus. Using a historical dataset of closely related S. aureus strains from clonal complex 8, we identified several independent recombination events leading to changes in the esaG repertoire. We further showed that similar events are observed for an immunity protein encoded by Group B Streptococcus spp. suggesting that recombination plays a broader role in the evolution of T7SS immunity-encoding genes. We speculate that gain and loss of T7 immunity genes is weighed in response to environmental pressure and metabolic burden.",

    "abstract": "Accurate chromosome segregation, controlled by kinetochore-mediated chromatid attachments to the mitotic spindle, ensures the faithful inheritance of genetic information. Kinetochores assemble onto specialized CENP-A nucleosomes (CENP-ANuc) of centromeric chromatin. In humans, this is mostly organized as thousands of copies of an [~]171 bp -satellite repeat. Here, we describe the cryo-EM structure of the human inner kinetochore CCAN (Constitutive Centromere Associated Network) complex bound to CENP-ANuc reconstituted onto -satellite DNA. CCAN forms edge-on contacts with CENP-ANuc, while a linker DNA segment of the -satellite repeat emerges from the fully-wrapped end of the nucleosome to thread through the central CENP-LN channel which tightly grips the DNA. The CENP-TWSX histone-fold module, together with CENP-HIKHead, further augments DNA binding and partially wraps the linker DNA in a manner reminiscent of canonical nucleosomes. Our study suggests that the topological entrapment of the -satellite repeat linker DNA by CCAN provides a robust mechanism by which the kinetochore withstands the pushing and pulling of centromeres associated with chromosome congression and segregation forces.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe human inner kinetochore CCAN complex tightly grips the linker DNA of the -satellite CENP-A nucleosome.",

    "abstract": "Spelling errors are ubiquitous in all writing systems. Most studies exploring spelling errors focused on the phonological plausibility of errors. However, unlike typical pseudohomophones, spelling errors occur in naturally produced written language with variable frequencies. We investigated the time course of recognition of the most frequent orthographic errors in Russian (error in an unstressed vowel at the root) and the effect of word frequency on this process. During ERP recording, 26 native Russian speakers silently read high-frequency correctly spelled words, low-frequency correctly spelled words, high-frequency words with errors, and low-frequency words with errors. The amplitude of P200 was more positive for correctly spelled words than for misspelled words and did not depend on the frequency of the words. Word frequency affected spelling recognition in the later stages of word processing (350-700 ms): high-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater P300 than high-frequency correctly spelled words, and low-frequency misspelled words elicited a greater N400 than low-frequency correctly spelled words. We observe spelling effects in the same time window for both the P300 and N400, which may reflect temporal overlap between mainly categorization processes based on orthographic properties for high-frequency words and phonological processes for low-frequency words. We concluded that two independent pathways can be active simultaneously during spelling recognition: one reflects mainly orthographic processing of high-frequency words and the other is the phonological processing of low-frequency words. Our findings suggest that these pathways are associated with different ERP components. Therefore, our results complement existing reading models and demonstrate that the neuronal underpinnings of spelling error recognition during reading depend on word frequency.",

    "abstract": "The goal of auditory attention decoding (AAD) is to determine to which speaker out of multiple competing speakers a listener is attending based on the brain signals recorded via, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG). AAD algorithms are a fundamental building block of so-called neuro-steered hearing devices that would allow identifying the speaker that should be amplified based on the brain activity. A common approach is to train a subject-specific stimulus decoder that reconstructs the amplitude envelope of the attended speech signal. However, training this decoder requires a dedicated  ground-truth EEG recording of the subject under test, during which the attended speaker is known. Furthermore, this decoder remains fixed during operation and can thus not adapt to changing conditions and situations. Therefore, we propose an online time-adaptive unsupervised stimulus reconstruction method that continuously and automatically adapts over time when new EEG and audio data are streaming in. The adaptive decoder does not require ground-truth attention labels obtained from a training session with the end-user and instead can be initialized with a generic subject-independent decoder or even completely random values. We propose two different implementations: a sliding window and recursive implementation, which we extensively validate on three independent datasets based on multiple performance metrics. We show that the proposed time-adaptive unsupervised decoder outperforms a time-invariant supervised decoder, representing an important step toward practically applicable AAD algorithms for neuro-steered hearing devices.",

    "abstract": "The pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of a specific immunological niche is not fully understood. Here, we used a golden Syrian hamster model to systematically evaluate the kinetics of host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, following disease pathology, viral loads, antibody responses, and inflammatory cytokine expression in multiple organs. The kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and genomewide lung transcriptome was also compared between immunocompetent and immunocompromised hamsters. We observed that the body weight loss was proportional to the SARS-CoV-2 infectious dose and lasted for a short time only in immunocompetent hamsters. Body weight loss was more prominent and prolonged in infected immunocompromised hamsters. While the kinetics of viral replication and peak live viral loads were not significantly different at low and high infectious doses (LD and HD), the HD-infected immunocompetent animals developed severe lung disease pathology. The immunocompetent animals cleared the live virus in all tested tissues by 12 days post-infection and generated a robust serum antibody response. In contrast, immunocompromised hamsters mounted an inadequate SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response, and the virus was detected in the pulmonary and multiple extrapulmonary organs until 16 days post-infection. These hamsters also had prolonged moderate inflammation with severe bronchiolar-alveolar hyperplasia/metaplasia. Consistent with the difference in disease presentation, distinct changes in the expression of inflammation and immune cell response pathways and network genes were seen in the lungs of infected immunocompetent and immunocompromised animals. This study highlights the interplay between the kinetics of viral replication and the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis at organ-level niches and maps how COVID-19 symptoms vary in different immune contexts. Together, our data suggest that the histopathological manifestations caused by progressive SARS-CoV-2 infection may be a better predictor of COVID-19 severity than individual measures of viral load, antibody response, and cytokine storm at the systemic or local (lungs) levels in the immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts.",

    "abstract": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) were identified about 20 years ago, based on their unique ability to rapidly produce copious amounts of all subsets of type I and type III interferon (IFN-I/III) upon virus sensing, while being refractory to infection. Yet, the identity and physiological functions of pDC are still a matter of debate, in a large part due to their lack of specific expression of any single cell surface marker or gene that would allow to track them in tissues and to target them in vivo with high specificity and penetrance. Indeed, recent studies showed that previous methods that were used to identify or deplete pDC also targeted other cell types, including pDC-like cells and transitional DC (tDC) that were proposed to be responsible for all the antigen presentation ability previously attributed to steady state pDC. Hence, improving our understanding of the nature and in vivo choreography of pDC physiological functions requires the development of novel tools to unambiguously identify and track these cells, including in comparison to pDC-like cells and tDC. Here, we report successful generation of a pDC-reporter mouse model, by using an intersectional genetic strategy based on the unique co-expression of Siglech and Pacsin1 in pDC. This pDC-Tomato mouse strain allows specific ex vivo and in situ detection of pDC. Breeding them with Zbtb46GFP mice allowed side-by-side purification and transcriptional profiling by single cell RNA sequencing of bona fide pDC, pDC-like cells and tDC, in comparison to type 1 and 2 conventional DC (cDC1 and cDC2), both at steady state and during a viral infection, revealing diverging activation patterns of pDC-like cells and tDC. Finally, by breeding pDC-Tomato mice with Ifnb1EYFP mice, we determined the choreography of pDC recruitment to the micro-anatomical sites of viral replication in the spleen, with initially similar but later divergent behaviors of the pDC that engaged or not into IFN-I production. Our novel pDC-Tomato mouse model, and newly identified gene modules specific to combinations of DC types and activations states, will constitute valuable resources for a deeper understanding of the functional division of labor between DC types and its molecular regulation at homeostasis and during viral infections.",

    "abstract": "Rapid ecological speciation along depth gradients has taken place independently and repeatedly in freshwater fishes. While the extent of genomic divergence between ecomorphs is often well understood, the molecular mechanisms facilitating such rapid diversification are typically unclear. In Lake Masoko, an East African crater lake, the cichlid Astatotilapia calliptera has diverged into shallow littoral and deep benthic ecomorphs with strikingly different jaw structures within the last 1,000 years. Using genome-wide transcriptome data from jaw tissue, we explore two major regulatory transcriptional mechanisms, expression and splicing QTL variants and examine their contribution to differential gene expression underpinning functional phenotypes. We identified 7,550 genes with significant differential expression between ecomorphs, of which 4.2% were regulated by cis-regulatory expression QTLs, and 6.4% were regulated by cis-regulatory splicing QTLs. There were also strong signals of divergent selection of differentially expressed genes that showed divergent regulation from expression, splicing or both QTL variants, including genes associated with major jaw plasticity and adaptation networks, adaptive immune system response, and oxidoreductase processes. These results suggest that transcriptome plasticity and modification have important roles during early-stage ecological speciation and demonstrate the role of regulatory-variants as important targets of selection driving ecologically-relevant divergence in gene expression that is associated with adaptive diversification.",

The mechanisms of EGFR endocytosis and its crosstalk with signaling are poorly understood.

Using this approach, we identified a network of signaling proteins, which remain associated with the receptor during its internalization and trafficking through the endosomal system. We showed that Trk-fused gene (TFG), a protein known to function at the endoplasmic reticulum exit sites, was enriched in the proximity proteome of EGFR in early/sorting endosomes and localized in these endosomes, and demonstrated that TFG regulates endosomal sorting of EGFR. This study provides a comprehensive resource of time-dependent nanoscale environment of EGFR, thus opening avenues to discovering new regulatory mechanisms of signaling and intracellular trafficking of receptor tyrosine kinases.",

These effects are examined both separately and in combination to demonstrate how many digenic traits, especially double homozygous ones, can show significant, sometimes unexpected, changes in population frequency with inbreeding, linkage, and linkage disequilibrium. The effects of selection on deleterious digenic traits are also detailed.

As such, understanding how cells and organisms respond to hypoxia is of great importance. The family of transcription factors called Hypoxia Inducible Factors (HIFs) coordinate a transcriptional programme required for survival and adaptation to hypoxia. The effects of hypoxia and HIF on the chromatin accessibility landscape are still unclear. Here, using genome wide mapping of chromatin accessibility via ATAC-seq, we find hypoxia induces loci specific changes in chromatin accessibility enriched at hypoxia transcriptionally responsive genes. These changes are predominantly HIF dependent, reversible upon reoxygenation and partially mimicked by chemical HIF stabilisation independent of molecular dioxygenase inhibition. This work demonstrates that indeed, HIF stabilisation is necessary and sufficient to alter chromatin accessibility in hypoxia, with implications for our understanding of gene expression regulation by hypoxia and HIF.",

    "abstract": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism of small RNA-mediated genome regulation commonly involved in suppression of transposable elements (TEs) through both post-transcriptional silencing, and transcriptional repression via heterochromatin assembly. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been extensively utilised as a model for studying RNAi pathways. However, this species is somewhat atypical in that TEs are not major targets of RNAi, and instead small RNAs correspond primarily to non-coding pericentromeric repeat sequences, reflecting a specialised role for the pathway in promoting heterochromatin assembly in these regions. In contrast, in the related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, sequenced small RNAs correspond primarily to TEs. This suggests there may be fundamental differences in the operation of RNAi pathways in these two related species. To investigate these differences, we probed RNAi function in S. japonicus. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to S. pombe, we found that RNAi is essential in this species. Moreover, viability of RNAi mutants can be rescued by mutations implicated in enhanching RNAi-independent heterochromatin propagation. These rescued strains retain heterochromatic marks on TE sequences, but exhibit derepression of TEs at the post-transcriptional level. Our findings indicate that S. japonicus retains the ancestral role of RNAi in facilitating suppression of TEs via both post-transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin assembly, with specifically the heterochromatin pathway being essential for viability, likely due to a function in genome maintenance. The specialised role of RNAi in heterochromatin assembly in S. pombe appears to be a derived state that emerged after the divergence of S. japonicus.",

    "abstract": "Cells use signal relay to transmit information across tissue scales. However, the production of information carried by signal relay remains poorly characterised. To determine how the coding features of signal relay are generated, we used the classic system for long-range signalling: the periodic cAMP waves that drive Dictyostelium collective migration. Combining imaging and optogenetic perturbation of cell signalling states, we find that migration is triggered by an increase in wave frequency generated at the signalling centre. Wave frequency is regulated by cAMP wave circulation, which organises the long-range signal. To determine the mechanisms modulating wave circulation, we combined mathematical modelling, the general theory of excitable media and mechanical perturbations to test competing models. Models in which cell density and spatial patterning modulate the wave frequency cannot explain the temporal evolution of signalling waves. Instead, our evidence leads to a model where wave circulation increases the ability for cell to relay the signal, causing further increase in the circulation rate. This implies that information driving a morphogenetic transition gradually unfolds due to positive feedback between cell signalling state and signalling pattern. This demonstrates how the coding properties of a long-range signal arise from self-organised wave dynamics at the signalling centre.",

The IMD correlates both temporally and spatially with the polar cell envelope elongation in M. smegmatis. Whether or not a similar membrane domain exists in pathogenic species remains unknown. Here we show that the IMD is a conserved membrane structure found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We used two independent approaches, density gradient fractionation of membrane domains and visualization of IMD-associated proteins through fluorescence microscopy, to determine the characteristics of the plasma membrane compartmentalization in M. tuberculosis. Proteomic analysis revealed that the IMD is enriched in metabolic enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of conserved cell envelope components such as peptidoglycan, arabinogalactan, and phosphatidylinositol mannosides. Using a fluorescent protein fusion of IMD-associated proteins, we demonstrated that this domain is concentrated in the polar region of the rod-shaped cells, where active cell envelope biosynthesis is taking place. Proteomic analysis further revealed the enrichment of enzymes involved in synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosates and phenolic glycolipids in the IMD. We validated the IMD association of two enzymes, 1,3-fucosyltransferase and fucosyl 4- O-methyltransferase, which are involved in the final maturation steps of phenolic glycolipid biosynthesis. Taken together, these data indicate that functional compartmentalization of membrane is an evolutionarily conserved feature found in both M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis, and M. tuberculosis utilizes this membrane location for the synthesis of its surface- exposed lipid virulence factors.\n\nIMPORTANCEM. tuberculosis remains an important public health threat, with more than one million deaths every year. The pathogens ability to survive in the human host for decades highlights the importance of understanding how this bacterium regulates and coordinates its metabolism, cell envelope elongation, and growth. The IMD is a membrane structure that associates with the subpolar growth zone of actively growing mycobacteria, but its existence is only known in a non- pathogenic model, M. smegmatis. Here, we demonstrated the presence of the IMD in M. tuberculosis, making the IMD an evolutionarily conserved plasma membrane compartment in mycobacteria. Furthermore, our study revealed that the IMD is the factory for synthesizing phenolic glycolipids, virulence factors produced by slow-growing pathogenic species.",

    "abstract": "Wnt11 family proteins are ligands that activate a type of Dishevelled-mediated, non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway. Loss of function causes defects in gastrulation and/or anterior-posterior axis extension in all vertebrates. Non-mammalian vertebrate genomes encode two Wnt11 family proteins whose distinct functions have been unclear. We knocked down zygotic Wnt11b and Wnt11, separately and together, in Xenopus laevis. Single morphants exhibited very similar phenotypes of delayed blastopore closure, but they had different phenotypes at the tailbud stage. In response to their very similar gastrulation phenotypes, we chose to characterize dual morphants. Using dark field illuminated time-lapse imaging and kymograph analysis, we identified a failure of dorsal blastopore lip maturation that correlated with slower blastopore closure and failure to internalize the endoderm at the dorsal blastopore lip. We connected these externally visible phenotypes to cellular events in the internal tissues - including the archenteron - by imaging intact embryos stained for anillin and microtubules. The cleavage furrow protein anillin provided an exceptional cytological marker for blastopore lip and archenteron morphogenesis and the consequent disruption through loss of Wnt 11 signaling. These cytological changes suggest a novel role for the regulation of contractility and stiffness of the epithelial cells that result in dramatic shape changes and are important in gastrulation.",

    "abstract": "Selective allosteric modulators bear great potential to fine-tune neurotransmitter-induced brain receptor responses. Promising targets are metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors, which are associated to different brain diseases. These multidomain class C GPCRs experience concerted structural rearrangements and rely on allosteric modulation of agonist action to be fully activated. Here we establish live cell compatible fluorescence labeling of mGlu2 by click chemistry through genetic code expansion. Using lanthanide resonance energy transfer, we establish multiple FRET sensors to monitor ligand effects on conformational changes in mGlu2 extracellular domain and subsequently dissect the underlying conformational states by smFRET. Using three distinct FRET sensors, we demonstrate that mGlu activation relies on a ligand-induced sampling of three conformational states. Orthosteric agonists act by promoting the closure of the mGlu2 ligand binding domains, leading to an equilibrium between an inactive intermediate and the active state. Allosteric modulator further push this equilibrium toward the active state, promoting and stabilizing the relative reorientation of the mGlu protomers. These results underline the complex and dynamic nature of such type of neuroreceptors, pointing out that ligands fine-tune activation by differentially acting on the equilibria between multiple states.",

    "abstract": "The Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling pathway regulates multiple cellular processes during development and many diseases, including cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Despite their hydrophobic nature, Wnt proteins exert their function over long distances to induce paracrine signalling. Recent studies have identified several factors involved in Wnt secretion, however, our understanding of how Wnt ligands are transported between cells to interact with their cognate receptors is still debated. Here, we demonstrate that gastric cancer cells utilise cytonemes to transport Wnt3 intercellularly to promote proliferation. Furthermore, we identify the membrane-bound scaffolding protein Flotillin-2 (Flot2), frequently overexpressed in gastric cancer, as a regulator of these cytonemes. Together with the Wnt co-receptor and cytoneme initiator Ror2, Flot2 determines the number and length of Wnt3 cytonemes in gastric cancer. Finally, we show that Flot2 is necessary for Wnt8a cytonemes during zebrafish embryogenesis, suggesting a conserved mechanism for Flot2-mediated Wnt transport on cytonemes in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Archaeal pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetases (PylRSs) have been used to genetically encode over 200 distinct noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) in proteins in E. coli and mammalian cells. This vastly expands the range of chemical functionality accessible within proteins produced in these organisms. Despite these clear successes, explorations of PylRS function in yeast remains limited. In this work, we demonstrate that the Methanomethylophilus alvus PylRS (MaPylRS) and its cognate tRNACUA support the incorporation of ncAAs into proteins produced in S. cerevisiae using stop codon suppression methodologies. Additionally, we prepared three MaPylRS mutants originally engineered in E. coli and determined that all three were translationally active with one or more ncAAs, although with low efficiencies of ncAA incorporation in comparison to the parent MaPylRS. Alongside MaPylRS variants, we evaluated the translational activity of previously reported Methanosarcina mazei, Methanosarcina barkeri, and chimeric M. mazei and M. barkeri PylRSs. Using the yeast strain RJY100, and pairing these aaRSs with the M. barkeri tRNACUA, we did not observe any detectable stop codon suppression activity under the same conditions that produced moderately efficient ncAA incorporation with MaPylRS. The addition of MaPylRS to the orthogonal translation machinery toolkit in yeast potentially opens the door to hundreds of ncAAs that have not previously been genetically encodable using other aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs. Extending the scope of ncAA incorporation in yeast could powerfully advance chemical and biological research for applications ranging from basic biological discovery to enzyme engineering and therapeutic protein lead discovery.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=164 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475408v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (25K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@606cceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@874cadorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bb2c99org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6cf963_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Close analysis of an extensive data set combined with independent evidence prompts our proposal to view human lifetimes as individually finite but collectively unbounded. We formulate a model incorporating this idea whose predictions agree very well with the observed data. In the model, human lifetimes are theoretically unbounded, but the probability of an individual living to an extreme age is negligible, so lifetimes are effectively limited. Our model incorporates a mortality hazard rate plateau and a late-life mortality deceleration effect in conjunction with a newly observed advanced age mortality acceleration. This reconciles many previously observed effects. The model is temporally stable: consistent with observation, parameters do not change over time. As an application, assuming no major medical advances, we predict the emergence of many individuals living past 120, but due to accelerating mortality find it unlikely that any will subsequently survive to an age of 125.",

Further, due to the diverse signals implicated in naive T cell survival, it has been a long-held and conceptually attractive view that they are sustained by active homeostatic control as thymic activity wanes. Here we employ multiple experimental systems to identify a unified model of naive CD4 and CD8 T cell population dynamics across the mouse lifespan. We infer that both subsets divide rarely and progressively increase their survival capacity with cell age. Strikingly, this simple model captures naive CD4 T cell dynamics throughout life. In contrast, we find that newly generated naive CD8 T cells are lost more rapidly during the first 3-4 weeks of life, likely due to increased recruitment into memory. We find no evidence for elevated division rates in neonates, or for feedback regulation of naive T cell numbers at any age. We show how confronting mathematical models with diverse datasets can reveal a quantitative and remarkably simple picture of naive T cell dynamics from birth into old age.",

    "abstract": "Currently, treatments for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are focussed on treatment of disease symptoms rather than addressing the cause of disease, which could lead to remission and cure. Central to disease development is the induction of autoimmunity through a breach of self-tolerance. There is considerable research in RA focussed on antigens and approaches to re-establish antigen specific tolerance. A crucial step in this research is to employ appropriate animal models to test prospective antigen specific immunotherapies, preferably in the context of joint inflammation.\n\nIn this short communication, we use our previously developed model of antigen specific inflammatory arthritis in which OVA-specific TcR tg T cells drive breach of tolerance to endogenous antigens to determine the impact that the timing of therapy administration has upon disease progression. Using antigen feeding to induce tolerance we demonstrate that administration prior to articular challenge results in a reduced disease score as evidenced by pathology and serum antibody responses. By contrast, feeding antigen after articular challenge had the opposite effect and resulted in the exacerbation of pathology.\n\nAlthough preliminary, these data suggest that the timing of antigen administration may be key to the success of tolerogenic immunotherapies. This has important implications for the timing of potential tolerogenic therapies in patients.",

    "abstract": "Winter wheat is a major crop with a rich selection history in the modern era of crop breeding. Genetic gains across economically important traits like yield have been well characterized and are the major force driving its production. Winter wheat is also an excellent model for analyzing historical genetic selection. As a proof of concept, we analyze two major collections of winter wheat varieties that were bred in western Europe from 1916 to 2010, namely the Triticeae Genome (TG) and WAGTAIL panels, which include 333 and 403 varieties respectively. We develop and apply a selection mapping approach, Regression of Alleles on Years (RALLY), in these panels, as well as in simulated populations. RALLY maps loci under sustained historical selection by using a simple logistic model to regress allele counts on years of variety release. To control for drift-induced allele frequency change, we develop a hybrid approach of genomic control and delta control. Within the TG panel, we identify 22 significant RALLY quantitative selection loci (QSLs) and estimate the local heritabilities for 12 traits across these QSLs. By correlating predicted marker effects with RALLY regression estimates, we show that alleles whose frequencies have increased over time are heavily biased towards conferring positive yield effect, but negative effects in flowering time, lodging, plant height and grain protein content. Altogether, our results (1) demonstrate the use of RALLY to identify selected genomic regions while controlling for drift, and (2) reveal key patterns in the historical selection in winter wheat and guide its future breeding.\n\nKey MessageModelling of the distribution of allele frequency over year of variety release identifies major loci involved in historical breeding of winter wheat.",

    "abstract": "Cohesin folds mammalian interphase chromosomes by extruding the chromatin fiber into numerous loops. \"Loop extrusion\" can be impeded by chromatin-bound factors, such as CTCF, which generates characteristic and functional chromatin organization patterns. It has been proposed that transcription relocalizes or interferes with cohesin, and that active promoters are cohesin loading sites. However, the effects of transcription on cohesin have not been reconciled with observations of active extrusion by cohesin. To determine how transcription modulates extrusion, we studied mouse cells in which we could alter cohesin abundance, dynamics, and localization by genetic  knockouts of the cohesin regulators CTCF and Wapl. Through Hi-C experiments, we discovered intricate, cohesin-dependent contact patterns near active genes. Chromatin organization around active genes exhibited hallmarks of interactions between transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) and extruding cohesins. These observations could be reproduced by polymer simulations in which RNAPs were \"moving barriers\" to extrusion that obstructed, slowed, and pushed cohesins. The simulations predicted that preferential loading of cohesin at promoters is inconsistent with our experimental data. Additional ChIP-seq experiments showed that the putative cohesin loader Nipbl is not predominantly enriched at promoters. Therefore, we propose that cohesin is not preferentially loaded at promoters and that the barrier function of RNAP accounts for cohesin accumulation at active promoters. Altogether, we find that RNAP is a new type of extrusion barrier that is not stationary, but rather, translocates and relocalizes cohesin. Loop extrusion and transcription might interact to dynamically generate and maintain gene interactions with regulatory elements and shape functional genomic organization.\n\nSignificance StatementLoop extrusion by cohesin is critical to folding the mammalian genome into loops. Extrusion can be halted by CTCF proteins bound at specific genomic loci, which generates chromosomal domains and can regulate gene expression. However, the process of transcription itself can modulate cohesin, thus refolding chromosomes near active genes. Through experiments and simulations, we show that transcribing RNA polymerases (RNAPs) act as \"moving barriers\" to loop-extruding cohesins. Unlike stationary CTCF barriers, RNAPs actively relocalize cohesins, which generates characteristic patterns of spatial organization around active genes. Our model predicts that the barrier function of RNAP can explain why cohesin accumulates at active promoters and provides a mechanism for clustering active promoters. Through transcription-extrusion interactions, cells might dynamically regulate functional genomic contacts.",
