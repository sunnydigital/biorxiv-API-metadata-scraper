    "abstract": "Whooping cough (pertussis) is a highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the bacterium Bordetella pertussis. Despite high vaccine coverage, pertussis has re-emerged in many countries and caused two large epidemics in Australia since 2007. Here, we undertook a genomic and phylogeographic study of 385 Australian B. pertussis isolates collected from 2008 to 2017. The Australian B. pertussis population was found to be composed of mostly ptxP3 strains carrying different fim3 alleles, with ptxP3-fim3A genotype expanded far more than ptxP3-fim3B. Within the former, there were six co-circulating epidemic lineages (EL1 to EL6). The multiple ELs emerged, expanded, and then declined at different time points over the two epidemics, likely driven by immune selection from pertussis vaccination and natural infection in addition to local and global transmission events. Both hard and soft selective sweeps through vaccine selection pressures determined the current B. pertussis population dynamics. Relative risk analysis found that once a new B. pertussis lineage emerged, it was more likely to spread locally within the first 1.5 years. However, after 1.5 years, any new lineage was likely to expand to a wider region and became no longer spatially structured across the country. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the expansion of ptxP3 strains was also associated with replacement of the type III secretion system allele bscI1 with bscI3. This study advanced our understanding of the epidemic population structure and spatial and temporal dynamics of B. pertussis in a highly immunised population.",

    "abstract": "Massively-parallel measurements of dominant negative inhibition by protein fragments have been used to map protein interaction sites and discover peptide inhibitors. However, the underlying principles governing fragment-based inhibition have thus far remained unclear. Here, we adapt a high-throughput inhibitory fragment assay for use in Escherichia coli, applying it to a set of ten essential proteins. This approach yielded single amino acid-resolution maps of inhibitory activity, with peaks localized to functionally important interaction sites, including oligomerization interfaces and folding contacts. Leveraging these data, we perform a systematic analysis to uncover principles of fragment-based inhibition. We determine a robust negative correlation between susceptibility to inhibition and cellular protein concentration, demonstrating that inhibitory fragments likely act primarily by titrating native protein interactions. We also characterize a series of trade-offs related to fragment length, showing that shorter peptides allow higher-resolution mapping but suffer from lower inhibitory activity. We employ an unsupervised statistical analysis to show that the inhibitory activities of protein fragments are largely driven not by generic properties such as charge, hydrophobicity, and secondary structure, but by the more specific characteristics of their bespoke macromolecular interactions. AlphaFold computational modeling of peptide complexes with one protein shows that the inhibitory activity of peptides is associated with their predicted ability to form native-like interactions. Overall, this work demonstrates fundamental characteristics of inhibitory protein fragment function and provides a foundation for understanding and controlling protein interactions in vivo.\n\nSignificance StatementPeptide fragments derived from protein sequences can inhibit interactions of their parental proteins, providing a promising avenue for drug development. Here we employ a massively-parallel assay to measure in vivo inhibition by fragments that tile the full sequences of ten essential bacterial proteins. We leverage these data to decipher principles of fragment-based inhibition, showing how parental protein concentration drives activity and how protein fragment length interplays with activity and specificity. We employ statistical analysis to parse the roles of biophysical properties in fragment-to-fragment variation, and AlphaFold modeling to determine the relationship between measured inhibitory activity and predicted native-like binding. These results provide a path towards rational design of peptide inhibitors and broader principles of protein-protein interactions in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Adult mammals are incapable of multi-tissue regeneration and augmentation of this potential may drastically shift current therapeutic paradigms. Here, we found that a common co-receptor of IL-6 cytokines, glycoprotein 130 (gp130), serves as a major nexus integrating various context-specific signaling inputs to either promote regenerative outcomes or aggravate disease progression. Via genetic and pharmacological experiments in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrated that a signaling tyrosine 814 (Y814) within gp130 serves as a major cellular stress sensor. Mice with constitutively inactivated Y814 (F814) exhibit regenerative, not reparative, responses after wounding in skin and anti-degenerative responses in the synovial joint. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of gp130 Y814 results in regeneration of multiple tissues in several species as well as disease modification in animal models of osteoarthritis. Our study characterizes a novel molecular mechanism that, if selectively manipulated, enhances the intrinsic regenerative capacity while preventing pathological outcomes in injury and disease.\n\nSummaryGp130 Y814 signaling module serves as a cellular stress sensor responsible for hindering tissue regeneration while triggering pathological outcomes after injury.",

    "abstract": "Small RNAs are known to mediate silencing of transposable elements and other genomic loci, increasing nucleosome density and preventing undesirable gene expression. Post-zygotic development of the Paramecium somatic genome requires elimination of thousands of transposon remnants (IESs) and transposable elements that are scattered throughout the germline genome (Garnier et al. 2004). The elimination process is guided by Piwi-associated small RNAs and leads to precise cleavage at IES boundaries (Bouhouche et al. 2011; Furrer et al. 2017). Previous research suggests that small RNAs induce heterochromatin formation within IESs, which, in turn, is required for DNA elimination (Liu et al. 2007). Here we show that IES recognition and precise excision is facilitated by recruitment of a homolog of a chromatin remodeler ISWI, which depletes target genomic regions of nucleosomes, making the chromatin accessible for DNA cleavage. ISWI knockdown in Paramecium leads to pronounced inhibition of DNA elimination. Furthermore, nucleosome profiling indicates that ISWI is required for IES elimination in nucleosome-dense genomic regions, while other IESs do not require small RNAs or ISWI for excision. ISWI silencing notably also reduces DNA elimination precision, resulting in aberrant excision at alternative IES boundaries. In summary, we demonstrate that chromatin remodeling that increases DNA accessibility together with small RNAs are necessary for efficient and precise DNA elimination in Paramecium.",

    "abstract": "Mycoviruses are widely distributed across fungi, including yeasts of the Saccharomycotina subphylum. It was recently discovered that the yeast species Pichia membranifaciens contained double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that were predicted to be of viral origin. The fully sequenced dsRNA is 4,578 bp in length, with RNA secondary structures similar to the packaging, replication, and frameshift signals of totiviruses of the family Totiviridae. This novel virus has been named Pichia membranifaciens virus L-A (PmV-L-A) and is related to other totiviruses previously described within the Saccharomycotina yeasts. PmV-L-A is part of a monophyletic subgroup within the I-A totiviruses, implying a common ancestry between mycoviruses isolated from the Pichiaceae and Saccharomycetaceae yeasts. Energy minimized AlphaFold2 molecular models of the PmV-L-A Gag protein revealed structural conservation with the previously solved structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae virus L-A (ScV-L-A) Gag protein. The predicted tertiary structure of the PmV-L-A Pol and its homologs provide details of the potential mechanism of totivirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps) because of structural similarities to the RdRps of mammalian dsRNA viruses. Insights into the structure, function, and evolution of totiviruses gained from yeasts is important because of their parallels with mammalian viruses and the emerging role of totiviruses in animal disease.",

    "abstract": "Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists are effective in treating type 2 diabetes and obesity with proven cardiovascular benefits. However, most of them are peptides and require subcutaneous injection except for orally available semaglutide. Boc5 was identified as the first orthosteric non-peptidic agonist of GLP-1R that mimics a broad spectrum of bioactivities of GLP-1 in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of Boc5 and its analog WB4-24 in complex with the human GLP-1R and Gs protein. Bound to the extracellular domain, extracellular loop 2, and transmembrane (TM) helices 1, 2, 3 and 7, one arm of both compounds inserted deeply into the bottom of the orthosteric binding pocket that is usually accessible by peptidic agonists, thereby partially overlapping with the residues A8-D15 in GLP-1. The other three arms, meanwhile, extended to the TM1-TM7, TM1-TM2, and TM2-TM3 clefts showing an interaction feature substantially similar to a previously known small molecule agonist LY3502970. Such a unique binding mode creates a distinct conformation that confers both peptidomimetic agonism and biased signaling induced by non-peptidic modulators at GLP-1R. Further, the conformational difference between Boc5 and WB4-24, two closed related compounds, provides a structural framework for fine tuning of pharmacological efficacy in the development of future small molecule therapeutics targeting GLP-1R.\n\nSignificanceGLP-1R agonists are efficacious in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. While most clinically used agents require subcutaneous injection, Boc5, as the first orthosteric non-peptidic agonist of GLP-1R, suffers from poor oral bioavailability that hinders its therapeutic development. The cryo-electron microscopy structures of Boc5 and its closely related analog WB4-24 presented here reveal a previously unknown binding pocket located deeper in the transmembrane domain for non-peptidic GLP-1R agonists. Molecular interaction with this site may facilitate a broad spectrum of in vivo agonistic activities, in addition to that with the upper helical bundles presumably responsible for biased signaling. These findings deepen our understanding of peptidomimetic agonism at GLP-1R and may help design better drug leads against this important target.",

Here, we report 16 novel reprogramming roadblock genes identified by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome-wide knockout (KO) screening. Of these, depletion of the predicted KRAB zinc finger protein (KRAB-ZFP) Zfp266 strongly and consistently enhanced iPSC generation in several iPSC reprogramming settings, emerging as the most robust roadblock. Further analyses revealed that ZFP266 binds Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements (SINEs) adjacent to binding sites of pioneering factors, OCT4 (POU5F1), SOX2 and KLF4, and impedes chromatin opening. Replacing the KRAB co-suppressor with a co-activator domain converted ZFP266 from a reprogramming inhibitor to a potent reprogramming facilitator. This work proposes SINE-KRAB-ZFP interaction to be a critical regulator of chromatin accessibility at enhancers for efficient cellular identity changes and also serves as a resource to further illuminate molecular mechanisms hindering reprogramming.",

Here, we adapt and refine 16 biophysical guidelines for climate-smart marine reserves for the transboundary California Bight ecoregion. We link several climate-adaptation strategies (e.g., maintaining connectivity, representing climate refugia, and forecasting effectiveness of protection) by focusing on kelp forests and associated species. We quantify transboundary larval connectivity along [~]800 km of coast and find that the number of connections and the average density of larvae dispersing through the network under future climate scenarios could decrease by [~]50%, highlighting the need to protect critical steppingstone nodes. We also find that although focal species will generally recover with 30% protection, marine heatwaves could hinder subsequent recovery in the following 50 years, suggesting that protecting climate refugia and expanding the coverage of marine reserves is a priority. Together, these findings provide a first comprehensive framework for integrating climate resilience for networks of marine reserves and highlight the need for a coordinated approach in the California Bight ecoregion.",

    "abstract": "The animal gut microbiome has been implicated in a number of key biological processes, ranging from digestion to behavior, and has also been suggested to facilitate local adaptation. However, studies in wild animals rarely compare multiple populations that differ ecologically, which is the level at which local adaptation may occur. Further, few studies simultaneously characterize diet and the gut microbiome from the same sample, despite the likely presence of co-dependencies. Here, we investigate the interplay between diet and gut microbiome in three geographically isolated populations of the critically endangered Grauers gorilla, which we show to be genetically differentiated. We find population- and social group-specific dietary and gut microbial profiles and co-variation between diet and gut microbiome, despite the presence of core microbial taxa. There was no detectable effect of age, sex, or genetic relatedness on the microbiome. Diet differed considerably across populations, with the high-altitude population consuming a lower diversity of plants compared to low-altitude populations, consistent with food plant availability constraining diet. The observed pattern of covariation between diet and gut microbiome is likely a result of long-term social and ecological factors. Our study suggests that the gut microbiome is sufficiently plastic to support flexible food selection and hence contribute to local adaptation.",

At the core of this technique are two essential steps: (1) a system of ODEs that approximate spatial interactions among neighboring individuals must be solved; (2) the time-variable has to be rescaled with a factor (called \"\") that depends on the kinetic parameters of the wild type and mutant individuals. An explicit formula for  is derived, which is a power law of division and death rates of the two types. The method is relatively fast and provides excellent time-series agreement with the stochastic simulation results for the spatial agent-based model.

Here, we quantified social associations and their link to fitness annually and over lifetime, using a multi-generational, genetic pedigree. We used social network analysis to calculate variables representing different aspects of an individuals sociality. Sociality showed high within-individual repeatability. We found that birds with more opposite-sex associates had higher annual fitness than those with fewer, but this did not translate to lifetime fitness. Instead, for lifetime fitness, we found evidence for stabilizing selection on opposite-sex sociality, and sociality in general, suggesting that reported benefits are only short-lived in a wild population, and that selection favours an average sociality.",

    "abstract": "Multiple metaxin-like proteins are shown to exist in fungi, as also found for the metaxin proteins of vertebrates and invertebrates. In vertebrates, metaxins 1 and 2 are mitochondrial membrane proteins that function in the import of proteins into mitochondria. Fungal metaxin-like proteins were identified by criteria including their homology with human metaxins and the presence of characteristic GST_N_Metaxin, GST_C_Metaxin, and Tom37 protein domains. Fungi in different taxonomic divisions (phyla) were found to possess multiple metaxin-like proteins. These include the Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Chytridiomycota, Mucoromycota, Neocallimastigomycota, and Zoopagomycota divisions. Most fungi with multiple metaxin-like proteins contain two proteins, designated MTXa and MTXb. Amino acid sequence alignments show a high degree of homology among MTXa proteins, with over 60% amino acid identities, and also among MTXb proteins of fungi in the same division. But very little homology is observed in aligning MTXa with MTXb proteins of the same or different fungi. Both the MTXa proteins and MTXb proteins have the protein domains that characterize the metaxins and metaxin-like proteins: GST_N_Metaxin, GST_C_Metaxin, and Tom37. The metaxins and metaxin-like proteins of vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, protists, and bacteria all possess these domains. The secondary structures of MTXa and MTXb proteins are both dominated by similar patterns of -helical segments, but extensive {beta}-strand segments are absent. Nine highly conserved -helical segments are present, the same as other metaxins and metaxin-like proteins. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that MTXa and MTXb proteins of fungi form two separate and distinct groups. These groups are also separate from the groups of vertebrate metaxins, metaxin-related Sam37 proteins of yeasts, and metaxin-like FAXC proteins.",

    "abstract": "Many physical, epidemiological, or physiological dynamical processes on networks support front-like propagation, where an initial localized perturbation grows and systematically invades all nodes in the network. A key question is then to extract estimates for the dynamics. In particular, if a single node is seeded at a small concentration, when will other nodes reach the same initial concentration? Here, motivated by the study of toxic protein propagation in neurodegenerative diseases, we present and compare three different estimates for the arrival time in order of increasing analytical complexity: the linear arrival time, obtained by linearizing the underlying system; the Lambert time, obtained by considering the interaction of two nodes; and the nonlinear arrival time, obtained by asymptotic techniques. We use the classic Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov equation as a paradigm for the dynamics and show that each method provides different insight and time estimates. Further, we show that the nonlinear asymptotic method also gives an approximate solution valid in the entire domain and the correct ordering of arrival regions over large regions of parameters and initial conditions.",

    "abstract": "Proteins are the main structural and functional components of cells, and their dynamic regulation and post-translational modifications (PTMs) underlie cellular phenotypes. Next-generation DNA sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of heredity and gene regulation, but the complex and dynamic states of cells are not fully captured by the genome and transcriptome. Sensitive measurements of the proteome are needed to fully understand biological processes and changes to the proteome that occur in disease states. Studies of the proteome would benefit greatly from methods to directly sequence and digitally quantify proteins and detect PTMs with single-molecule sensitivity and precision. However current methods for studying the proteome lag behind DNA sequencing in throughput, sensitivity, and accessibility due to the complexity and dynamic range of the proteome, the chemical properties of proteins, and the inability to amplify proteins. Here, we demonstrate single-molecule protein sequencing on a compact benchtop instrument using a dynamic sequencing by stepwise degradation approach in which single surface-immobilized peptide molecules are probed in real-time by a mixture of dye-labeled N-terminal amino acid recognizers and simultaneously cleaved by aminopeptidases. By measuring fluorescence intensity, lifetime, and binding kinetics of recognizers on an integrated semiconductor chip we are able to annotate amino acids and identify the peptide sequence. We describe the expansion of the number of recognizable amino acids and demonstrate the kinetic principles that allow individual recognizers to identify multiple amino acids in a highly information-rich manner that is sensitive to adjacent residues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method is compatible with both synthetic and natural peptides, and capable of detecting single amino acid changes and PTMs. We anticipate that with further development our protein sequencing method will offer a sensitive, scalable, and accessible platform for studies of the proteome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPrior research has identified altered brain structure and function in individuals at risk for self-directed violence thoughts and behaviors. However, these studies have largely utilized healthy controls and findings have been inconsistent. Thus, this study examined differences in resting-state functional network connectivity among individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) versus lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone.\n\nMethodsUsing data from the UK Biobank, this study utilized a series of linear regressions to compare individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) (n = 566) versus lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone (n = 3,447) on within- and between-network resting-state functional connectivity subnetworks.\n\nResultsThere were no significant between-group differences for between-network, within-network, or whole-brain functional connectivity after adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, and body mass index and performing statistical corrections for multiple comparisons.\n\nConclusionsResting-state network measures may not differentiate between individuals with lifetime suicide attempt(s) and lifetime self-directed violence thoughts alone. Null findings diverge from results reported in smaller neuroimaging studies of suicide risk, but are consistent with null findings in other large-scale studies and meta-analyses. Strengths of the study include its large sample size and stringent control group. Future research on a wider array of imaging, genetic, and psychosocial risk factors can clarify relative contributions of individual and combined variables to suicide risk and inform scientific understanding of ideation-to-action framework.",

    "abstract": "Sleep is the brain state when cortical activity decreases and memory consolidates. However, in human epileptic patients, including genetic epileptic seizures such as Dravet syndrome, sleep is the preferential period when epileptic spike-wave discharges (SWDs) appear, with more severe epileptic symptoms in female patients than male patients, which influencing patient sleep quality and memory. Currently, seizure onset mechanisms during sleep period still remain unknown. Our previous work has shown that the sleep-like state-dependent synaptic potentiation mechanism can trigger epileptic SWDs(Zhang et al., 2021). In this study, using one heterozygous (het) knock-in (KI) transgenic mice (GABAA receptor {gamma}2 subunit Gabrg2Q390X mutation) and an optogenetic method, we hypothesized that slow-wave oscillations (SWOs) themselves in vivo could trigger epileptic seizures. We found that epileptic SWDs in het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice exhibited preferential incidence during NREM sleep period, accompanied by motor immobility/ facial myoclonus/vibrissal twitching, with more frequent incidence in female het KI mice than male het KI mice. Optogenetic induced SWOs in vivo significantly increased epileptic seizure incidence in het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice with increased duration of NREM sleep or quiet-wakeful states. Furthermore, suppression of SWO-related homeostatic synaptic potentiation by 4- (diethylamino)-benzaldehyde (DEAB) injection (i.p.) greatly decreased seizure incidence in het KI mice, suggesting that SWOs did trigger seizure activity in het KI mice. In addition, EEG delta-frequency (0.1-4 Hz) power spectral density during NREM sleep was significantly larger in female het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice than male het Gabrg2+/Q390X KI mice, which likely contributes to the gender difference in seizure incidence during NREM sleep/quiet-wake as that in human patients.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus (S.) aureus is an important pathogen causing various infections including - as most frequently isolated bacterium - cutaneous infections. Keratinocytes as the first barrier cells of the skin respond to S. aureus by the release of defense molecules such as cytokines and antimicrobial peptides. Although several pattern recognition receptors expressed in keratinocytes such as Toll-like and NOD-like receptors have been reported to detect the presence of S. aureus, the mechanisms underlying the interplay between S. aureus and keratinocytes are still emerging. Here we report that S. aureus induced gene expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1, responsive genes of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). AhR activation by S. aureus was further confirmed by AhR gene reporter assays. AhR activation was mediated by factor(s) < 2 kDa secreted by S. aureus. Whole transcriptome analyses and real-time PCR analyses identified IL-24, IL-6 and IL-1beta as cytokines induced in an AhR-dependent manner in S. aureus-treated keratinocytes. AhR inhibition in a 3D organotypic skin equivalent confirmed the crucial role of the AhR in mediating the induction of IL-24, IL-6 and IL-1beta upon stimulation with living S. aureus. Taken together, we further highlight the important role of the AhR in cutaneous innate defense and identified the AhR as a novel receptor mediating the sensing of the important skin pathogen S. aureus in keratinocytes.",

    "abstract": "Persons with cystic fibrosis, starting in early life, have intestinal microbiome dysbiosis characterized in part by a decreased relative abundance of the genus Bacteroides. Bacteroides is a major producer of the intestinal short chain fatty acid (SCFA) propionate. We demonstrate here that CFTR-/- Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells are responsive to the anti-inflammatory effects of propionate. Furthermore, Bacteroides isolates inhibit the IL-1{beta}-induced inflammatory response of CFTR-/- Caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells and do so in a propionate-dependent manner. Bacteroides isolates also produce low levels of butyrate; this SCFA is positively correlated with inhibition of the inflammatory response. Finally, the introduction of Bacteroides-supplemented stool from infants with CF into the gut of CftrF508del mice results in an increase in propionate in the stool as well as the reduction in several systemic pro-inflammatory cytokines. Bacteroides supplementation also reduced the fecal relative abundance of E. coli, indicating a potential interaction between these two microbes, consistent with previous clinical studies. Together, our data indicate the important role of Bacteroides and Bacteroides-derived propionate in the context of the developing microbiome in infants and children with CF, which could help explain the observed gut-lung axis in CF.",

Using a modified peptide microarray approach termed Linear motif discovery using rational design (LOCATE), we characterized the interaction of the disordered negative-arm clock protein FREQUENCY to its partner protein FREQUENCY-Interacting RNA helicase. LOCATE identified a specific Short Linear Motif (SLiM) and interaction \"hotspot\" as well as positively charged \"islands\" that mediate electrostatic interactions, suggesting a model where negative arm proteins form a \"fuzzy\" complex essential for clock timing and robustness. Further analysis revealed that the positively charged islands were an evolutionarily conserved feature in higher eukaryotes and contributed to proper clock function.",

We found that when GJA1-20k is present, bands of actin surround mitochondria at locations enriched with GJA1-20k, inducing mitochondrial fission which generates less oxygen free radicals, protecting hearts subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury. Here, we report that GJA1-20k is a direct actin binding protein and thereby identify the mechanism by which GJA1-20k is able to recruit and stabilize actin filaments around the mitochondria. Surprisingly, GJA1-20k functions as a canonical actin capping protein, producing both truncated actin puncta and stabilized actin filaments. GJA1-20k contains an RPEL-like actin binding motif, and we confirm with both computational modeling and biochemistry, that this domain is crucial for actin capping. The actin capping functionality of GJA1-20k adds GJA1-20k to the family of proteins that regulate actin dynamics. As a stress responsive protein, GJA1-20k can help explain cytoskeletal dependent responses to cellular stress, from delivery of channels to affecting mitochondrial size and function.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic analyses of local ancestry tracts routinely assume that the ancestral admixture process is identical for both parents of an individual, an assumption that may be invalid when considering recent admixture. Here we present Parental Admixture Proportion Inference (PAPI), a Bayesian tool for inferring the admixture proportions and admixture times for each parent of a single admixed individual. PAPI analyzes unphased local ancestry tracts and has two components models: a binomial model that exploits the informativeness of homozygous ancestry regions to infer parental admixture proportions, and a hidden Markov model (HMM) that infers admixture times from tract lengths. Crucially, the HMM employs an approximation to the pedigree crossover dynamics that accounts for unobserved within-ancestry recombination, enabling inference of parental admixture times. We compared the accuracy of PAPIs admixture proportion estimates with those of ANCESTOR in simulated admixed individuals and found that PAPI outperforms ANCESTOR by an average of 46% in a representative set of simulation scenarios, with PAPIs estimates deviating from the ground truth by 0.047 on average. Moreover, PAPIs admixture time estimates were strongly correlated with the ground truth in these simulations (R = 0.76), but have an average downward bias of 1.01 generations that is partly attributable to inaccuracies in local ancestry inference. As an illustration of its utility, we ran PAPI on real African Americans from the PAGE study (N = 5, 786) and found strong evidence of assortative mating by ancestry proportion: couples ancestry proportions are closer to each other than expected by chance (P < 10-6), and are highly correlated (R = 0.87). We anticipate that PAPI will be useful in studying the population dynamics of admixture and will also be of interest to individuals seeking to learn about their personal genealogies.",

    "abstract": "The ability of trypanosome parasites to survive and sustain infections is dependent on diverse and intricate immune evasion mechanisms. Pathogenic trypanosomes often have broad host niches that preclude identification of host specific adaptations. In contrast, some non-pathogenic species of the genus Trypanosoma have highly specific hosts and vectors. Trypanosoma theileri, a non-pathogenic parasite of bovines, has a predicted surface protein architecture that likely aids survival in its mammalian host, distinct from the dominant variant surface glycoprotein coat of pathogenic African trypanosomes. In both species, their surface proteins are encoded by genes which account for [~]10% of their genome. A non-pathogenic parasite of sheep, Trypanosoma melophagium, is transmitted by the sheep ked and is closely related to T. theileri. To explore host and vector specificity between these closely related species, we sequenced the T. melophagium genome and transcriptome and an annotated draft genome was assembled. T. melophagium was compared to 43 kinetoplastid genomes, including T. theileri. T. melophagium and T. theileri have an AT biased genome, the greatest bias of publicly available trypanosomatids. This trend may result from selection acting to decrease the genome nucleotide cost. The T. melophagium genome is 6.3Mb smaller than T. theileri and large families of proteins, characteristic of the predicted surface of T. theileri, were found to be absent or greatly reduced in T. melophagium. Instead, T. melophagium has modestly expanded protein families associated with the avoidance of complement-mediated lysis. The genome of T. melophagium contains core genes required for development, glycolysis, RNA interference, and meiotic exchange, each being shared with T. theileri. Comparisons between T. melophagium and T. theileri provide insight into the specific adaptations of these related trypanosomatids to their distinct mammalian hosts and arthropod vectors.\n\nAuthor summaryNon-pathogenic trypanosomes can have narrow host niches, with closely related trypanosome species expanding into distinct mammalian host and insect vectors. T. theileri, a non-pathogenic trypanosome of bovines, is predicted to have an intricate cell surface which allows it to evade the immune response of its mammalian host. In contrast, T. melophagium is closely related to T. theileri but infects sheep and is transmitted by the sheep ked rather than tabanid flies that transmit T. theileri. Here, we sequence and assemble the T. melophagium genome to identify the genomic basis of host and vector specificity in these non-pathogenic trypanosomes. We confirm the two species are closely related, however, T. melophagium has a smaller genome than T. theileri. Most of the discrepancy in genome size is due to an expansion of putative cell surface genes in T. theileri. The differential investment in cell surface proteins could be due to a focus on adaptation to the mammalian host in T. theileri and the insect host in T. melophagium.\n\nData summaryThe genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes used in this study were accessed from the TriTrypDB repository or NCBI. T. theileri genome sequencing data was downloaded from NCBI SRA (SRR13482812). T. melophagium data generated during this study is available from the NCBI BioProject PRJNA786535.\n\nRepositoriesT. melophagium DNA and RNA sequencing data, along with the draft genome assembly and its annotation, can be found under the NCBI BioProject PRJNA786535.",

In here, we combined biochemical and biophysical approaches to determine the factors influencing iM stability in a wide range of experimental conditions. By using high resolution primer extension assays, circular dichroism and absorption spectroscopies, we demonstrate that the stability of three different biologically relevant iMs are not dependent on molecular crowding agents. Instead, some of the crowding agents affected overall DNA synthesis. We also tested a range of small molecules to determine their effect on iM stabilization at physiological temperature, and demonstrated that the G-quadruplex-specific molecule, CX-5461, is also a promising candidate for selective iM stabilization. This work provides important insights into the requirements needed for different assays to accurately study iM stabilization, which will serve as important tools for understanding iMs biological roles and their potential as therapeutic targets.",

Here we report the discovery of Sirt3 modulators, including activators, through the use of DNA encoded library technology (DEL). The most enriched compounds after DEL selection against SIRT3 were evaluated according to their activity and affinity. Our best activator seems at least as potent as Honokiol (HKL) while the docking studies suggest that our modulators interact with Sirt3 at an atypical site.

    "abstract": "Cargo adaptors are crucial in coupling motor proteins with their respective cargos and regulatory proteins. BicD2 is a prominent example within the cargo adaptor family. BicD2 is able to recruit the microtubule motor dynein to RNA, viral particles and nuclei. The BicD2-mediated interaction between the nucleus and dynein is implicated in mitosis, interkinetic nuclear migration (INM) in radial glial progenitor cells, and neuron precursor migration during embryonic neocortex development. In vitro studies involving full-length cargo adaptors are difficult to perform due to the hydrophobic character, low-expression levels, and intrinsic flexibility of cargo adaptors. Here we report the recombinant production of full-length human BicD2 and confirm its biochemical activity by interaction studies with RanBP2. We also describe pH-dependent conformational changes of BicD2 using cryoEM, template-free structure predictions, and biophysical tools. Our results will help define the biochemical parameters for the in vitro reconstitution of higher order BicD2 protein complexes.",

    "abstract": "A family of cytosolic copper (Cu) storage proteins (the Csps) are widespread in bacteria. The Csps can bind large quantities of Cu(I) via their Cys-lined four-helix bundles, and the majority are cytosolic (Csp3s). This is inconsistent with the current dogma that bacteria, unlike eukaryotes, have evolved not to maintain intracellular pools of Cu due to its potential toxicity. Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis has been used to investigate if a Csp3 can store Cu(I) in the cytosol for a target enzyme. The activity of the Cu-requiring endospore multi-Cu oxidase BsCotA (a laccase) increases under Cu-replete conditions in wild type B. subtilis, but not in the strain lacking BsCsp3. Cuprous ions readily transfer from BsCsp3, but not from the cytosolic copper metallochaperone BsCopZ, to BsCotA in vitro producing active enzyme. Both BsCsp3 and BsCotA are upregulated during late sporulation. The hypothesis we propose is that BsCsp3 acquires and stores Cu(I) in the cytosol for BsCotA.",

    "abstract": "Identifying genetic and chemical perturbations with similar impacts on cell morphology can reveal compounds mechanisms of action or novel regulators of genetic pathways. Research on methods for identifying such similarities has lagged due to a lack of carefully designed and well-annotated image sets of cells treated with chemical and genetic perturbations. Here, we create such a Resource dataset, CPJUMP1, where each perturbed gene is a known target of at least two chemical compounds in the dataset. We systematically explore the directionality of correlations among perturbations that target the same gene, and we find that identifying matches between chemical perturbations and genetic perturbations is a challenging task. Our dataset and baseline analyses provide a benchmark for evaluating methods that measure perturbation similarities and impact, and more generally, learn effective representations of cellular state from microscopy images. Such advancements would accelerate the applications of image-based profiling, such as functional genomics and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric fusion transcription factors are oncogenic hallmarks of several devastating cancer types including pediatric sarcomas, such as Ewing sarcoma (EwS) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS). Despite their exquisite specificity, these driver oncogenes have been considered largely undruggable due to their lack of enzymatic activity.\n\nHere, we show in the EwS model that - capitalizing on neomorphic DNA-binding preferences - the addiction to the respective fusion transcription factor EWSR1-FLI1 can be leveraged to express therapeutic genes.\n\nWe genetically engineered a de novo enhancer-based, synthetic and highly potent expression cassette that can elicit EWSR1-FLI1-dependent expression of a therapeutic payload as evidenced by episomal and CRISPR-edited genomic reporter assays. Combining in silico screens and immunohistochemistry, we identified GPR64 as a highly specific cell surface antigen for targeted transduction strategies in EwS. Functional experiments demonstrated that anti-GPR64-pseudotyped lentivirus harboring our expression cassette can specifically transduce EwS cells to promote the expression of viral thymidine kinase sensitizing EwS for treatment to the otherwise relatively non-toxic (Val)ganciclovir and leading to strong anti-tumorigenic, but no adverse effects in vivo. Further, we prove that similar vector designs can be applied in PAX3-FOXO1-driven ARMS, and to express immunomodulatory cytokines, such as IL-15 and XCL1, in tumor types typically considered to be immunologically  cold.\n\nCollectively, these results generated in pediatric sarcomas indicate that exploiting, rather than suppressing, the neomorphic functions of chimeric transcription factors may open inroads to innovative and personalized therapies, and that our highly versatile approach may be translatable to other cancers addicted to oncogenic transcription factors with unique DNA-binding properties.",

    "abstract": "KRAS signaling has been extensively studied, yet the clarification between KRAS-autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms are still less explored. Understanding how KRAS signaling and effects are affected by exogenous stimuli can provide valuable insights not only to understand resistance mechanisms that justify pathway inhibition failure, but also to uncover novel therapeutic targets for mutant KRAS patients. Hence, aiming at understanding KRAS-autonomous versus non autonomous mechanisms, we studied the response of two mutant KRAS colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and LS174T) - control and KRAS silenced- to TGF{beta}1-activated fibroblasts secretome. By performing a total proteome analysis, we observed that TGF{beta}1-activated fibroblast-secreted factors triggered cell line-specific proteome alterations and that mutant KRAS governs approximately 1/3 of those alterations. Moreover, the analysis of the impact of exogenous factors on the modulation of KRAS proteome revealed that, in both cell lines, more than 2/3 of the KRAS-associated proteome is controlled in a KRAS-non-autonomous manner and dependent on the exogenous factors. This work highlights the context-dependency of KRAS-associated signaling and reinforces the importance of establishing more integrative models resembling the complexity of the tumor microenvironment to study KRAS-associated signals.",

    "abstract": "The Domains Rearranged Methyltransferases (DRMs) are crucial for RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plant species. Setaria viridis is a model monocot species with a relatively compact genome that has limited transposable element content. CRISPR-based genome editing approaches were used to create loss-of-function alleles for the two putative functional DRM genes in S. viridis to probe the role of RdDM. The analysis of drm1ab double mutant plants revealed limited morphological consequences for the loss of RdDM. Whole-genome methylation profiling provided evidence for wide-spread loss of methylation in CHH sequence contexts, particularly in regions with high CHH methylation in wild-type plants. Evidence was also found for locus-specific loss of CG and CHG methylation, even in some regions that lack CHH methylation. Transcriptome profiling identified a limited number of genes with altered expression in the drm1ab mutants. The majority of genes with elevated CHH methylation directly surrounding the transcription start site or in nearby promoter regions do not have altered expression in the drm1ab mutant even when this methylation is lost, suggesting limited regulation of gene expression by RdDM. Detailed analysis of the expression of transposable elements identified several transposons that are transcriptionally activated in drm1ab mutants. These transposons likely require active RdDM for maintenance of transcriptional repression.\n\nSignificance statementMethylation profiling of Setaria viridis plants that lack functional Domains Rearranged Methyltransferase genes reveal widespread loss of DNA methylation in the CHH sequence context. Transcriptome analysis reveals a small set of genes and transposons that are silenced by RNA-directed DNA methylation.",

    "abstract": "Review, promotion, and tenure (RPT) processes at universities typically assess candidates along three dimensions: research, teaching, and service. In recent years, some have argued for the inclusion of a controversial fourth criterion: collegiality. While collegiality plays a role in the morale and effectiveness of academic departments, it is amorphic and difficult to assess, and could be misused to stifle dissent or enforce homogeneity. Despite this, some institutions have opted to include this additional element in their RPT documents and processes, but it is unknown the extent of this practice and how it varies across institution type and disciplinary units. This study is based on two sets of data: survey data collected as part of a project that explored the publishing decisions of faculty and how these related to perceived importance in RPT processes, and 864 RPT documents collected from 129 universities from the United States and Canada. We analysed these RPT documents to determine the degree to which collegiality and related terms are mentioned, if they are defined, and if and how they may be assessed during the RPT process. Results show that when collegiality and related terms appear in these documents they are most often just briefly mentioned. It is less common for collegiality and related terms to be defined or assessed in RPT documents. Although the terms are mentioned across all types of institutions, there is a statistically significant difference in how prevalent they are at each. Collegiality is more commonly mentioned in the documents of doctoral research-focused universities (60%), than of masters universities and colleges (31%) or baccalaureate colleges (15%). Results from the accompanying survey of faculty also support this finding: individuals from R-Types were more likely to perceive collegiality to be a factor in their RPT processes. We conclude that collegiality likely plays an important role in RPT processes, whether it is explicitly acknowledged in policies and guidelines or not, and point to several strategies in how it might be best incorporated in the assessment of academic careers.",

    "abstract": "In mammalian cell nuclei, the nuclear lamina (NL) underlies the nuclear envelope (NE) to maintain nuclear structure. The nuclear lamins, the major structural components of the NL, are involved in the protection against NE rupture induced by mechanical stress. However, the specific role of the lamins in repair of NE ruptures has not been fully determined. Our analyses using immunofluorescence and live-cell imaging revealed that lamin C but not the other lamin isoforms rapidly accumulated at sites of NE rupture induced by laser microirradiation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. The immunoglobulin-like fold domain and the NLS were required for the recruitment from the nucleoplasm to the rupture sites with the Barrier-to-autointegration factor (BAF). The accumulation of nuclear BAF and cytoplasmic cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) at the rupture sites was in part dependent on lamin A/C. These results suggest that nucleoplasmic lamin C, BAF and cGAS concertedly accumulate at sites of NE rupture for repair.\n\nSummaryKono et al. show the rapid recruitment of nucleoplasmic lamin C to sites of nuclear envelope rupture with Barrier-to-autointegration factor.

Recombination is initiated by double strand breaks (DSBs) catalyzed by the conserved enzyme Spo11. How this crucial event is connected to other meiotic processes is surprisingly variable depending on the species. Here, we knocked down Spo11 by CRISPR in the jellyfish Clytia hemisphaerica, belonging to Cnidaria, the sister group to Bilateria (where classical animal models are found). Spo11 mutants fail to assemble synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata, and in consequence homologous chromosome pairs disperse during oocyte growth, creating aneuploid but fertilizable eggs that develop into viable larvae. Clytia thus shares an ancient eukaryotic dependence of synapsis and chromosome segregation on Spo11-generated DSBs, and provides new evolutionary perspectives on meiosis regulation.",

    "abstract": "Anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) regulates a wide array of cellular functions involved in cell death, cell survival decisions and autophagy. Bcl-2 acts by both direct interaction with different components of the pathways involved and by intervening in intracellular Ca2+ signalling. The function of Bcl-2 is in turn regulated by post-translational modifications including phosphorylation at different sites by various protein kinases. Besides functions in cell death and apoptosis, Bcl-2 regulates cell differentiation processes, including of cardiomyocytes, although its mechanism of action in this process is not fully elucidated. To further address the role of Bcl-2 in cardiomyocyte differentiation, we investigated the effect of its genetic knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 on the differentiation and functional maturation trajectory of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to cardiomyocytes. Our results indicate that differentiation of hiPSC to cardiomyocytes is delayed by Bcl-2 KO. This effect was associated with smaller areas of spontaneously beating cells. At the cell population level this exhibited in reduced expression and activity of the cardiomyocyte Ca2+ toolkit. However, when restricting the comparison to the active areas exclusively Bcl-2 KO did not show to significantly alter the functionality of the differentiated cardiomyocytes. Finally, Bcl-2 KO reduced c-Myc expression early in the cardiac differentiation process which may account at least in part for the here observed delay in cardiac differentiation resulting reduced efficiency of the differentiation process. These data are supportive of a pivotal role for Bcl-2 in cardiomyocyte differentiation and maturation.",

By mining transcriptomic data comparing juvenile and adult HSPCs and reconstructing coordinately activated gene regulatory networks, we uncover the Polycomb repressor complex 1 (PRC1) component Cbx2 as an effector of Lin28b/let-7s control of hematopoietic maturation. We find that juvenile Cbx2-/- hematopoietic tissues show impairment of B-lymphopoiesis and a precocious adult-like myeloid bias and that Cbx2/PRC1 regulates developmental timing of expression of key hematopoietic transcription factors.

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic dynein is essential for intracellular transport, but because of its complexity, we still do not fully understand how this 1.5 megadalton protein works. Here, we used novel optical probes that enable single-particle tracking (SPT) of individual cargos transported by dynein motors in live neurons over 900 m. Analyses using the Fluctuation Theorem (FT) showed that the number of dynein molecules switches between 1-5 motors during the transport. Clearly resolved single-molecular steps revealed that the dwell times between individual steps were accurately described by an enzymatic cycle dominated by two equal and thermally-activated rate constants. Based on these data, we propose a new molecular model whereby each step requires the hydrolysis of 2 ATPs. The model is consistent with extensive structural, single-molecule and biochemical measurements.",

    "abstract": "We previously found that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) requires support from tumor-associated myeloid cells, which activate IGF1R signaling in the leukemic blasts. However, IGF1 is not sufficient to sustain T-ALL survival in vitro, implicating additional myeloid-mediated signals in T-ALL progression. Here, we find that T-ALL cells require close contact with myeloid cells to survive. Transcriptional profiling and in vitro assays demonstrate that integrin-mediated cell adhesion and activation of the downstream FAK/PYK2 kinases are required for myeloid-mediated support of T-ALL cells and promote IGF1R activation. Consistent with these findings, inhibition of integrins or FAK/PYK2 signaling diminishes leukemia burden in multiple organs and confers a survival advantage in a mouse model of T-ALL. Inhibiting integrin-mediated cell adhesion or FAK/PYK2 also diminishes survival of primary patient T-ALL cells co-cultured with myeloid cells. Furthermore, elevated integrin pathway gene signatures correlate significantly with myeloid enrichment and an inferior prognosis in pediatric T-ALL patients.\n\nStatement of significanceAlthough tumor-associated myeloid cells provide critical support for T-ALL, our understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. This study reveals that integrin-mediated adhesion and signaling are key mechanisms by which myeloid cells promote survival and progression of T-ALL blasts in the leukemic microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Many everyday tasks require people to solve computationally complex problems. However, little is known about the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving such problems. Here, we draw on computational complexity theory to address this issue. We performed an experiment in which participants solved several instances of the 0-1 knapsack problem, a combinatorial optimization problem, while undergoing ultra-high field (7T) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Instances varied in two task-independent measures of intrinsic computational hardness: complexity and proof hardness. We characterise a network of brain regions whose activation was correlated with both measures but in distinct ways, including the anterior insula, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and the intra-parietal sulcus/angular gyrus. Activation and connectivity changed dynamically as a function of complexity and proof hardness, in line with theoretical computational requirements. Overall, our results suggest that computational complexity theory provides a suitable framework to study the effects of computational hardness on the neural processes associated with solving complex cognitive tasks.",

    "abstract": "The characteristic endogenous circadian rhythm of plasma glucocorticoid concentrations is made up from an underlying ultradian pulsatile secretory pattern. Recent evidence has indicated that this ultradian cortisol pulsatility is crucial for normal emotional response in man. In this study, we investigate the anatomical transcriptional and cell type signature of brain regions sensitive to a loss of ultradian rhythmicity in the context of emotional processing. We combine human cell type and transcriptomic atlas data of high spatial resolution with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. We show that the loss of cortisol ultradian rhythm alters emotional processing response in cortical brain areas that are characterized by transcriptional and cellular profiles of GABAergic function. We find that two previously identified key components of rapid non-genomic GC signaling - the ANXA1 gene and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling - show top differential expression and the most significant enrichment. Our results further indicate that specific cell types, including a specific NPY-expressing GABAergic neuronal cell type, and specific G protein signaling cascades underly the cerebral effects of a loss of ultradian cortisol rhythm. Our results provide a biological mechanistic underpinning of our fMRI findings, indicating specific cell types and cascades as a target for manipulation in future experimental studies.",
