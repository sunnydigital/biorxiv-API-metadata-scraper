    "abstract": "The new SARS-CoV-2 variant Omicron is characterised, among others, by more than 30 amino acid changes (including 4 deletions and 1 insertion) occurring on the spike glycoprotein.\n\nWe report a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the Omicron spike amino acid changes in the interaction with human ACE2 receptor or with human antibodies, obtained by analysing the publicly available resolved 3D structures. Our analysis predicts that amino acid changes occurring on amino acids interacting with the ACE2 receptor may increase Omicron transmissibility. The interactions of Omicron spike with human antibodies can be both negatively and positively affected by amino acid changes, with a predicted total loss of interactions only in few complexes. We believe that such an approach can be used to better understand SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility, detectability, and epidemiology, especially when extended to other than spike proteins.",

    "abstract": "Gut metabolites are pivotal mediators of host-microbiome interactions and provide an important window on human physiology and disease. However, current methods to monitor gut metabolites rely on heavy and expensive technologies such as liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). In that context, robust, fast, field-deployable, and cost-effective strategies for monitoring fecal metabolites would support large-scale functional studies and routine monitoring of metabolites biomarkers associated with pathological conditions. Living cells are an attractive option to engineer biosensors due to their ability to detect and process many environmental signals and their self-replicating nature. Here we optimized a protocol for feces processing and gut metabolites detection using bacterial biosensors (bactosensors), enabling rapid evaluation of their operational capacity in these samples. We show that a simple filtration step is enough to remove host microbes and reproducibly obtain a physiological-derived media retaining important characteristics of human feces, such as matrix effects and endogenous metabolites. We measured how fecal samples affect the performance of biosensors for benzoate, lactate, anhydrotetracycline, and bile acids, and found that bactosensors are highly sensitive to fecal matrices. Sensitivity to the matrix is biosensor-dependent but also varies between individuals, highlighting the need for case-by-case optimization for bactosensors operation in feces. Finally, by detecting endogenous bile acids, we demonstrate that bactosensor can be used for metabolites monitoring in feces. This work lays the foundation for the optimization and use of bacterial biosensors for fecal metabolites monitoring. In the future, our method could also allow rapid pre-prototyping of engineered bacteria designed to operate in the gut, with applications to in situ diagnostics and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "A strong epidemiologic link exists between exposure to cigarette smoke (CS) and increased susceptibility to tuberculosis (TB). In vitro macrophage and in vivo murine studies showed that CS and nicotine impair host-protective immune cells against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. However, little is known about how CS may affect immunosuppressive cells in the context of MTB infection. Thus, we investigated whether CS-exposed T regulatory cells (Tregs) could exacerbate MTB infection in co-culture with human macrophages and in the adoptive transfer of Tregs from air- and CS-exposed mice. We found that exposure of primary human Tregs to CS extract impaired the ability of human monocyte-derived macrophages to control an MTB infection by inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagosome formation. Neutralization of CTLA-4 on the CS extract-exposed Tregs abrogated the impaired control of MTB infection in macrophage and Treg co-cultures. In Foxp3+GFP+DTR+ (Thy1.2) mice depleted of endogenous Tregs, adoptive transfer of Tregs from donor CS-exposed B6.PL(Thy1.1) mice with subsequent MTB infection of the recipient Thy1.2 mice resulted in a greater burden of MTB in the lungs and spleens than those that received Tregs from airexposed mice. Mice that received Tregs from CS-exposed mice and then infected with MTB had modest but significantly reduced numbers of interleukin-12-positive dendritic cells and interferon-gamma-positive CD4+ T cells in the lungs and increased number of programmed cell death protein-1 positive CD4+ T cells in both the lungs and spleens.",

We studied T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 and HCoVs in convalescent COVID-19 donors, and identified a highly conserved SARS-CoV-2 sequence S811-831, with two overlapping epitopes presented by common MHC-II proteins HLA-DQ5 and HLA-DP4. These epitopes were recognized by CD4+ T cells from convalescent COVID-19 donors, mRNA vaccine recipients, and by low-abundance CD4+ T cells in uninfected donors. TCR sequencing revealed a diverse repertoire with public TCRs. CD4+ T cell cross-reactivity was driven by the remarkably strong conservation of T cell contact residues in both HLA-DQ5 and HLA-DP4 binding frames, with distinct patterns of HCoV cross-reactivity explained by MHC-II binding preferences and substitutions at secondary TCR contact sites. These data highlight S811-831 as a highly-conserved CD4+ T cell epitope broadly recognized across human populations.",

    "abstract": "Construction and remodeling of the bacterial peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall must be carefully coordinated with cell growth and division. Central to cell wall construction are hydrolases that cleave bonds in peptidoglycan. These enzymes also represent potential new antibiotic targets. One such hydrolase, the amidase LytH in Staphylococcus aureus, acts to remove stem peptides from PG, controlling where substrates are available for insertion of new PG strands and consequently regulating cell size. When it is absent, cells grow excessively large and have division defects. For activity, LytH requires a protein partner, ActH, that consists of an intracellular domain, a large rhomboid protease domain, and three extracellular tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). Here we demonstrate that the amidase-activating function of ActH is entirely contained in its extracellular TPRs. We show that ActH binding stabilizes metals in the LytH active site, and that LytH metal binding in turn is needed for stable complexation with ActH. We further present a structure of a complex of the extracellular domains of LytH and ActH. Our findings suggest that metal cofactor stabilization is a general strategy used by amidase activators and that ActH houses multiple functions within a single protein.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of antibiotic resistance-associated death in the United States. Many antibiotics used to treat S. aureus, including the beta-lactams, target biogenesis of the essential peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall. Some hydrolases play important roles in cell wall construction and are potential antibiotic targets. The amidase LytH, which requires a protein partner, ActH, for activity, is one such hydrolase. Here, we uncover how the extracellular domain of ActH binds to LytH to stabilize metals in the active site for catalysis. This work advances our understanding of how hydrolase activity is controlled to contribute productively to cell wall synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Peptide hormones and neuropeptides are complex signaling molecules that predominately function through G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Two fundamental questions remained in the field of peptide-GPCR signaling systems are the basis for the diverse binding mode of peptide ligands and the specificity of G protein coupling. Here we report the structures of a neuropeptide, galanin, bound to its receptors, GAL1R and GAL2R, in complex with their primary G protein subtypes Gi and Gq, respectively. The structures reveal a unique binding pose of galanin, which almost  lay flat on the top of the receptor transmembrane domain pocket in an -helical conformation, and acts as an  allosteric-like agonist via a distinct signal transduction cascade. The structures also uncover the important features of intracellular loop 2 (ICL2) that mediate specific interactions with Gq, thus determining the selective coupling of Gq to GAL2R. ICL2 replacement in Gi-coupled GAL1R, OR, 5-HT1AR, and Gs-coupled b2AR and D1R with that of GAL2R promotes Gq coupling of these receptors, highlighting the dominant roles of ICL2 in Gq selectivity. Together our results provide important insights into peptide ligand recognition and allosteric activation of galanin receptors and uncover a general structural element for Gq coupling selectivity.",

Many piRNA factors are enriched in perinuclear germ granules, but whether their localization is required for piRNA biogenesis or function is not known. Here we show that GLH/VASA helicase mutants exhibit defects in forming perinuclear condensates containing PIWI and other small RNA cofactors. These mutant animals produce largely normal levels of piRNA but are defective in triggering piRNA silencing. Strikingly, while many piRNA targets are activated in GLH mutants, we observed that hundreds of endogenous genes are aberrantly silenced by piRNAs. This defect in self versus non-self recognition was also observed in other mutants where perinuclear P granules are disrupted. Together, our results argue that perinuclear germ granules function critically to promote the fidelity of piRNA- based transcriptome surveillance in C. elegans and preserve self versus non-self distinction.",

Yet, our understanding of this important biological process remains incomplete. To search for novel regulators of efferocytosis, we performed a FACS-based genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in primary murine macrophages. We identified a novel role for WDFY3 in efferocytosis by macrophages. WDFY3 deficiency in macrophages specifically impaired uptake, not binding, of apoptotic cells due to defective actin depolymerization. We further revealed that WDFY3 directly interacts with GABARAP, thus facilitating LC3 lipidation and subsequent lysosomal acidification to permit the degradation of apoptotic cell components. Although the C-terminus of WDFY3 was sufficient to rescue impaired degradation, full-length WDFY3 is still required for regulating uptake. Finally, WDFY3 is required for efficient efferocytosis in vivo in mice and in primary human macrophages.

    "abstract": "MotivationThe ability to generate sample-specific protein sequences is a crucial step in neo-antigen discovery, cancer vaccine development, and proteogenomics. The revolutionary increase in the throughput of sequencers has fueled large-scale genomic and transcriptomic studies, holding great promises for the emerging field of personalized medicine. However, most sequencing projects store their sequencing data in an abbreviated variant calling format (VCF) that is not immediately amenable to subsequent proteomic and peptidomic analyses. Furthermore, data processing of such increasingly massive genome-scale datasets calls for parallel and concurrent programming, and consequently refactoring of existing algorithms and/or the development of new parallel algorithms.\n\nResultsHere, we introduce sequence intermediate representation (SIR), a novel and generic algorithm for generating personalized or sample-specific protein sequences from a consequence-called VCF file and the corresponding reference proteome. An implementation of SIR, named VCF2Prot, was developed to aid personalized medicine and proteogenomics by generating personalized proteomes in FASTA format from a collection of consequence-called genomic alterations stored in a VCF file. Benchmarking VCF2Prot against the recently published PrecisionProDB showed an ~1000-fold improvement in runtime (depending on the input size). Furthermore, in a scale-up study VCF2Prot processed a VCF file containing 99,254 variants observed across 8,192 patients in ~ 11 minutes, demonstrating the massive improvement in the execution speed and the utility of SIR and VCF2prot in bridging large-scale genomic and proteomic studies.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationVCF2Prot comes with a permissive MIT-license, enabling the commercial and non-commercial utilization of the tool. The source code along with precompiled versions for Linux/Mac OS are available at https://github.com/ikmb/vcf2prot.

    "abstract": "Brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are a disorder wherein abnormal, enlarged blood vessels connect arteries directly to veins, without an intervening capillary bed. AVMs are one of the leading causes of hemorrhagic stroke in children and young adults. Most human sporadic brain AVMs are associated with genetic activating mutations in the KRAS gene. Our goal was to develop an in vitro model that would allow for simultaneous morphological and functional phenotypic data capture in real time during AVM disease progression. By generating human endothelial cells harboring a clinically relevant mutation found in most human patients (activating mutations within the small GTPase KRAS) and seeding them in a dynamic microfluidic cell culture system that enables vessel formation and perfusion, we demonstrate that vessels formed by KRAS4AG12V mutant endothelial cells (ECs) were significantly wider and more leaky than vascular beds formed by wild-type ECs, recapitulating key structural and functional hallmarks of human AVM pathogenesis. Immunofluorescence staining revealed a breakdown of adherens junctions in mutant KRAS vessels only, leading to increased vascular permeability, a hallmark of hemorrhagic stroke. Finally, pharmacological blockade of MEK kinase activity, but not PI3K inhibition, improved endothelial barrier function (decreased permeability) without affecting vessel diameter. Collectively, our studies describe the creation of human KRAS-dependent AVM-like vessels in vitro in a self-assembling microvessel platform that is amenable to phenotypic observation and drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "Cancer occurs as a consequence of multiple somatic mutations that lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Mutual exclusivity and co-occurrence of mutations imply--but do not prove--that they can exert synergistic or antagonistic epistatic effects on oncogenesis. Knowledge of these interactions, and the consequent trajectories of mutation and selection that lead to cancer has been a longstanding goal within the cancer research community. Recent research has revealed mutation rates and scaled selection coefficients for specific recurrent variants across many cancer types. However, estimation of pairwise and higher-order effects--essential to estimation of the trajectory of likely cancer genotoypes--has been a challenge. Therefore, we have developed a continuous-time Markov chain model that enables the estimation of mutation origination and fixation (flux), dependent on somatic cancer genotype. Coupling the continuous-time Markov chain model with a deconvolution approach provides estimates of underlying mutation rates and selection across the trajectory of oncogenesis. We demonstrate computation of fluxes and selection coefficients in a somatic evolutionary model for the four most frequently variant driver genes (TP53, LRP1B, KRAS and STK11) from 565 cases of lung adenocarcinoma. Our analysis reveals multiple antagonistic epistatic effects that reduce the possible routes of oncogenesis, and inform cancer research regarding viable trajectories of somatic evolution whose progression could be forestalled by precision medicine. Synergistic epistatic effects are also identified, most notably in the somatic genotype TP53+LRP1B for mutations in the KRAS gene, and in somatic genotypes containing KRAS or TP53 mutations for mutations in the STK11 gene. Large positive fluxes of KRAS variants were driven by large selection coefficients, whereas the flux toward LRP1B mutations was substantially aided by a large mutation rate for this gene. The approach enables inference of the most likely routes of site-specific variant evolution and estimation of the strength of selection operating on each step along the route, a key component of what we need to know to develop and implement personalized cancer therapies.",

Such heterologous suppressor tRNAs often show poor intrinsic activity, presumably due to the failure to optimally interact with a non-native translation system. This limitation can be addressed in E. coli using directed evolution. However, no suitable selection system is currently available to do the same in mammalian cells. Here we report virus-assisted directed evolution of tRNAs (VADER) in mammalian cells, which employs a double-sieve selection scheme to facilitate single-step enrichment of active-yet-orthogonal tRNA mutants from naive libraries. Using VADER, we developed improved mutants of M. mazei pyrrolysyl-tRNA, the most popular Uaa mutagenesis platform in eukaryotes. We also show that the higher activity of the most efficient mutants is specific for mammalian cells, alluding to an improved interaction with the unique mammalian translation system.",

Here we compare pandemic HIV-1(M) and non-pandemic HIV-(O) and HIV-2 strains finding that non-pandemic HIV replicate poorly in myeloid cell models due to activation of cGAS and TRIM5, and ensuing antiviral responses. We use phylogenetics and viral capsid structural biology to define specific differences between pandemic and non-pandemic HIV capsids and demonstrate that their genetic reversal in HIV-1(M) mutants causes TRIM5, cGAS and innate immune activation. We propose a model in which the parental lineage of pandemic HIV-1(M) has uniquely evolved a dynamic capsid that avoids activation of cGAS and TRIM5 to establish cloaked replication in myeloid cells. The unique adaptations of the pandemic virus lineage suggests a role in effective human-to-human transmissibility and highlight the importance of avoiding innate immune activation during pandemic human-to-human viral transmission.",

    "abstract": "The proliferation and differentiation of antigen-specific B cells, including the generation of germinal centers (GC), are prerequisites for long-lasting, high-affinity antibody-mediated immune protection. Affinity for antigen determines B cell recruitment, proliferation, differentiation and competitiveness in the response, largely through determining access to T cell help. However, how T cell derived signals contribute to these outcomes is incompletely understood. Here we report how the signature cytokine of follicular helper T cells, IL-21, acts as a key regulator of the initial B cell response. By activating AKT and S6, IL-21 accelerates cell cycle progression and the rate of cycle entry of B cells, increasing their contribution to the ensuing GC. This effect occurs over a wide range of initial B cell receptor affinities and the resultant increased proliferation can explain the IL-21-mediated promotion of plasma cell differentiation. Collectively, our data establish that IL-21 acts from the outset of a T cell dependent immune response to increase cell cycle progression and fuel cyclic re-entry of B cells thereby regulating the initial GC size and early plasma cell output.\n\nSummaryThe cytokine IL-21 is a regulator of B cell responses, increasing antibody quantity and quality. Here, we report that during germinal center initiation, IL-21 acts to increase the response magnitude by accelerating cell cycle speed and rate of entry.",

    "abstract": "Temperate coastal marine waters are often thermally stratified from spring through fall but can be dynamic and disrupted by tidal currents and wind-driven upwelling. These mixing events introduce deeper, cooler water with a higher partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2), and its associated microbial communities to the surface. Anecdotally, these events impact shellfish hatcheries and farms, warranting improved understanding of changes in composition and activity of marine microbial communities in relation to environmental processes. To characterize both compositional and functional changes associated with abiotic factors, here we generate a reference metatranscriptome from the Strait of Georgia over representative seasons and analyze metatranscriptomic profiles of the microorganisms present within intake water containing different pCO2 levels at a shellfish hatchery in British Columbia from June through October. Abiotic factors studied include pH, temperature, alkalinity, aragonite, calcite and pCO2. Community composition changes were observed to occur at broad taxonomic levels, and most notably to vary with temperature and pCO2. Functional gene expression profiles indicated a strong difference between early (June-July) and late summer (August-October) associated with viral activity. The taxonomic data suggests this could be due to the termination of cyanobacteria and phytoplankton blooms by viral lysis in the late season. Functional analysis indicated fewer differentially expressed transcripts associated with abiotic variables (e.g., pCO2) than with the temporal effect. Microbial composition and activity in these waters varies with both short-term effects observed alongside abiotic variation as well as long-term effects observed across seasons. The analysis of both taxonomy and functional gene expression simultaneously in the same samples by environmental RNA (eRNA metatranscriptomics) provided a more comprehensive view for monitoring water bodies than either would in isolation.",

    "abstract": "Recently, polygenic risk score (PRS) has gained significant attention in studies involving complex genetic diseases and traits. PRS is often derived from summary statistics, from which the independence between discovery and replication sets cannot be monitored. Prior studies, in which the independence is strictly observed, report a relatively low gain from PRS in predictive models of binary traits. We hypothesize that the independence assumption may be compromised when using the summary statistics, and suspect an overestimation bias in the predictive accuracy. To demonstrate the overestimation bias in the replication dataset, prediction performances of PRS models are compared when overlapping subjects are either present or removed. We consider the task of Alzheimers disease (AD) prediction across genetics datasets, including the International Genomics of Alzheimers Project (IGAP), AD Sequencing Project (ADSP), and Accelerating Medicine Partnership - Alzheimers Disease (AMP-AD). PRS is computed from either sequencing studies for ADSP and AMP-AD (denoted as rPRS) or the summary statistics for IGAP (sPRS). Two variables with the high heritability in UK Biobank, hypertension, and height, are used to derive an exemplary scale effect of PRS. Based on the scale effect, the expected performance of sPRS is computed for AD prediction. Using ADSP as a discovery set for rPRS on AMP-AD, {Delta}AUC and {Delta}R2 (performance gains in AUC and R2 by PRS) record 0.069 and 0.11, respectively. Both drop to 0.0017 and 0.0041 once overlapping subjects are removed from AMP-AD. sPRS is derived from IGAP, which records {Delta}AUC and {Delta}R2 of 0.051{+/-}0.013 and 0.063{+/-}0.015 for ADSP and 0.060 and 0.086 for AMP-AD, respectively. On UK Biobank, rPRS performances for hypertension assuming a similar size of discovery and replication sets are 0.0036{+/-}0.0027 ({Delta}AUC) and 0.0032{+/-}0.0028 ({Delta}R2). For height, {Delta}R2 is 0.029{+/-}0.0037. Considering the high heritability of hypertension and height of UK Biobank, we conclude that sPRS results from AD databases are inflated. The higher performances relative to the size of the discovery set were observed in PRS studies of several diseases. PRS performances for binary traits, such as AD and hypertension, turned out unexpectedly low. This may, along with the difference in linkage disequilibrium, explain the high variability of PRS performances in cross-nation or cross-ethnicity applications, i.e., when there are no overlapping subjects. Hence, for sPRS, potential duplications should be carefully considered within the same ethnic group.",

    "abstract": "It is currently accepted that activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) participate in T cell exclusion from tumor nests, but it remains unclear how they promote barrier phenotypes, and whether specific subsets are involved. Here, using single-cell RNA sequencing coupled with multiplex imaging on a large cohort of lung tumors, we identify four main CAF populations, of which only two are associated with T cell exclusion: (i) MYH11+SMA+ CAF, which are present in early-stage tumors and form a single-cell layer lining cancer aggregates, and (ii) FAP+SMA+ CAF, which appear in more advanced tumors and organize in patches within the stroma or in multiple layers around tumor nests. Both CAF populations show a contractility phenotype together with dense and aligned matrix fiber deposition compared to the T cell-permissive CAF. Yet they express distinct matrix genes, including COL4A1/COL9A1 (MYH11+SMA+ CAF) and COL11A1/COL12A1 (FAP+SMA+ CAF). Hereby, we uncovered unique molecular programs of CAF driving T cell marginalization, whose targeting should increase immunotherapy efficacy in patients bearing T cell-excluded tumors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe cellular and molecular programs driving T cell marginalization in solid tumors remain unclear.

Recent evidence suggests that the androgen receptor (AR) can promote tumor progression in DSRCTs. However, the mechanism of AR-induced oncogenic stimulation remains undetermined. Herein, we demonstrate that enzalutamide and AR-directed antisense oligonucleotides (AR-ASO) block 5-dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced DSRCT cell proliferation and reduce xenograft tumor burden. Gene expression analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) were performed to elucidate how AR signaling regulates cellular epigenetic programs. Remarkably, ChIP-seq revealed novel DSRCT-specific AR DNA binding sites adjacent to key oncogenic regulators, including WT1 (the C-terminal partner of the pathognomonic fusion protein) and FOXF1. Additionally, AR occupied enhancer sites that regulate the Wnt pathway, neural differentiation, and embryonic organ development, implicating AR in dysfunctional cell lineage commitment. Our findings have immediate clinical implications given the widespread availability of FDA-approved androgen-targeted agents used for prostate cancer.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYWe demonstrate that DSRCT, an aggressive pediatric cancer, is an AR-driven malignancy capable of responding to androgen deprivation therapy.",

    "abstract": "Enteric viruses encounter various bacteria in the host which can impact infection outcomes. The interactions between noroviruses and enteric bacteria are not well understood. Previous work determined that murine norovirus (MNV), a model norovirus, had decreased replication in antibiotic-treated mice compared with conventional mice. Although this suggests that microbiota promote MNV infection, the mechanisms are not completely understood. Additionally, prior work with other enteric viruses such as poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 demonstrated that virions bind bacteria, and exposure to bacteria stabilizes viral particles and limits premature RNA release. Therefore, we examined interactions between MNV and specific bacteria and the consequences of these interactions. We found that the majority of Gram-positive bacteria tested stabilized MNV, while Gram-negative bacteria did not stabilize MNV. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria bound to MNV. However, bacterial binding alone was not sufficient for virion stabilization since Gram-negative bacteria bound MNV but did not stabilize virions. Additionally, we found that bacterial conditioned media also stabilized MNV and this stabilization may be due to a small heat stable molecule. Overall this work identifies specific bacteria and bacterial components that stabilize MNV and may impact virion stability in the environment.\n\nImportanceEnteric viruses are exposed to a wide variety of bacteria in the intestine, but effects of bacteria on viral particles are incompletely understood. We found that murine norovirus (MNV) virion stability is enhanced in the presence of several Gram-positive bacterial strains. Virion stabilizing activity was also present in bacterial culture medium, and activity was retained upon heat or protease treatment. These results suggest that certain bacteria and bacterial products may promote MNV stability in the environment, which could influence viral transmission.",

    "abstract": "Predicting range expansion dynamics is a challenge for both fundamental and applied research in conservation and global change biology. However, if ecological and evolutionary processes occur on the same time scale, predictions are challenging to make. Combining experimental evolution and mathematical modelling, we assessed the predictability of independent realisations of range expansions in a laboratory model system, the freshwater protozoan Paramecium caudatum. We followed ecological dynamics and evolutionary change in range core and front populations in the experiment. These settings were recreated in a predictive mathematical model, parametrized with dispersal and growth data of the of the 20 founder strains in the experiment. We find that short-term evolution was driven by selection for increased dispersal at the front and general selection for higher growth rates in all treatments. There was a good quantitative match of predicted and observed trait changes. Phenotypic divergence was mirrored by a complete genotypic divergence, indicating the highly repeatable fixation of strains that also were the most likely winners in our model. Long-term evolution in the experimental range front lines resulted in the emergence of a dispersal syndrome, namely a competition - colonisation trade-off. Altogether, both model and experiment highlight the importance of dispersal evolution as a driver of range expansions. Our study suggests that evolution at range fronts may follow predictable trajectories, at least for simple scenarios, and that predicting these dynamics may be possible from knowledge of few key parameters.",

These genomes are often quite complex, e.g., harboring many duplicated genes, which were the main source of genetic innovation and often the results of recurrent polyploidization. Deciphering the complex genome structure and linking duplicated genes to specific polyploidization events are important to understand the biology and evolution of plants. However, the effort has been held back due to its high complexity in analyzing these genomes. Here, by hierarchically relating duplicated genes in colinearity to each polyploidization or speciation event, we analyzed 29 well-assembled and up-to-date Gramineae genome sequences, separated duplicated genes produced by each event, established lists of paralogous and orthologous genes, and eventually constructed an on-line database, GGDB (http://www.grassgenome.com/). Homologous gene lists from each plant and between them can be displayed, searched, and downloaded from the database. Interactive comparison tools were deployed to demonstrate homology among user-selected plants, to draw genome-scale or local alignment figures, phylogenetic trees of genes corrected by exploiting gene colinearity, etc. Using these tools and figures, users can easily observe genome structural changes, and explore the effects of paleo-polyploidy on crop genome structure and function.

    "abstract": "Progressively acquired somatic mutations in hematopoietic stem cells are central to pathogenesis in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). They can lead to proliferative advantages, impaired differentiation and progressive cytopenias. MDS or CMML patients with high-risk disease are treated with hypomethylating agents including 5-azacytidine (AZA). Clinical improvement does not require eradication of mutated cells and may be related to improved differentiation capacity of mutated hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). However, the contribution of mutated HSPCs to steadystate hematopoiesis in MDS and CMML is unclear. To address this, we characterised the somatic mutations of individual stem, progenitor (common myeloid progenitor, granulocyte monocyte progenitor, megakaryocyte erythroid progenitor), and matched circulating (monocyte, neutrophil, naive B cell) haematopoietic cells in treatment naive and AZA-treated MDS and CMML via high-throughput single cell genotyping. The mutational burden was similar across multiple hematopoietic cell types, and even the most mutated stem and progenitor clones maintained their capacity to differentiate to mature myeloid and, in some cases, lymphoid cell types in vivo. Our data show that even highly mutated HSPCs contribute significantly to circulating blood cells in MDS and CMML, prior to and following AZA treatment.\n\nKey points* Highly mutated HSPCs contribute significantly to circulating blood cells in MDS and CMML, prior to and following AZA treatment.\n* The mutational burden in matched bone marrow and peripheral blood cells in MDS and CMML was similar throughout myelopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is the epicenter of cellular aerobic metabolism. TCA cycle intermediates facilitate energy production and provide anabolic precursors, but also function as intra- and extracellular metabolic signals regulating pleiotropic biological processes. Despite the importance of circulating TCA cycle metabolites as signaling molecules, the source of circulating TCA cycle intermediates remains uncertain. We observe that in mice, the concentration of TCA cycle intermediates in the portal blood exceeds that in tail blood indicating that the gut is a major contributor to circulating TCA cycle metabolites. With a focus on succinate as a representative of TCA cycle intermediate with signaling activities and using a combination of germ-free mice and isotopomer tracing, we demonstrate that intestinal microbiota are not major contributors to circulating TCA cycle metabolites. Moreover, we demonstrate that the endogenous succinate production is markedly higher than intestinal succinate absorption in normal physiological conditions. Altogether, these results indicate that endogenous succinate production within the intestinal tissue is a major physiological source of circulating succinate. These results provide a foundation for investigation into the role of intestine in regulating circulating TCA cycle metabolites and related signaling effects in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Aversive responses to bright light (photoaversion) require signaling from the eye to the brain. Melanopsin-expressing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) encode absolute light intensity and are thought to provide the light signals for photoaversion. Consistent with this, neonatal mice exhibit photoaversion prior to the developmental onset of image vision, and melanopsin deletion abolishes photoaversion in neonates. It is not well understood how the population of ipRGCs, which constitutes multiple physiologically distinct types (denoted M1-M6 in mouse) encodes light stimuli to produce an aversive response. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that M1 ipRGCs that lack the Brn3b transcription factor drive photoaversion in neonatal mice. First, neonatal mice lacking TRPC6 and TRPC7 ion channels failed to turn away from bright light, while two photon Ca2+ imaging of their acutely isolated retinas revealed reduced photosensitivity in M1 ipRGCs, but not other ipRGC types. Second, mice in which all ipRGC types except for Brn3b-negative M1 ipRGCs are ablated, exhibited normal photoaversion. Third, pharmacological blockade or genetic knockout of gap junction channels expressed by ipRGCs, which reduces the light sensitivity of M2-M6 ipRGCs in the neonatal retina, had small effects on photoaversion only at the brightest light intensities. Finally, M1s were not strongly depolarized by spontaneous retinal waves, a robust source of activity in the developing retina that depolarizes all other ipRGC types. M1s therefore constitute a separate information channel between the neonatal retina and brain that could ensure behavioral responses to light but not spontaneous retinal waves.",

    "abstract": "Spreading depolarization (SD) is a slow-moving wave of neuronal depolarization accompanied by a breakdown of ion concentration homeostasis, followed by long periods of neuronal silence (spreading depression), and associated with several neurological conditions. We developed multiscale (ions to tissue slice) computer models of SD in brain slices using the NEURON simulator: 36,000 neurons (2 voltage-gated ion channels; 3 leak channels; 3 ion exchangers/pumps) in the extracellular space (ECS) of a slice (1 mm sides, varying thickness) with ion (K+, Cl-, Na+) and O2 diffusion and equilibration with a surrounding bath. Glia and neurons cleared K+ from the ECS via Na+/K+ pumps. SD propagated through the slices at realistic speeds of 2-4 mm/min, which increased by as much as 50% in models incorporating the effects of hypoxia or propionate. In both cases, the speedup was mediated principally by ECS shrinkage. Our model allows us to make testable predictions, including: 1. SD can be inhibited by enlarging ECS volume; 2. SD velocity will be greater in areas with greater neuronal density, total neuronal volume, or larger/more dendrites; 3. SD is all-or-none: initiating K+ bolus properties have little impact on SD speed; 4. Slice thickness influences SD due to relative hypoxia in the slice core, exacerbated by SD in a pathological cycle; 5. SD and high neuronal spike rates will be observed in the core of the slice. Cells in the periphery of the slice near an oxygenated bath will resist SD.\n\nSignificanceSpreading depolarization (SD) is a slow moving wave of electrical and ionic imbalances in brain tissue and is a hallmark of several neurological disorders. We developed a multiscale computer model of brain slices with realistic neuronal densities, ions, and oxygenation. Our model shows that SD is exacerbated by and causes hypoxia, resulting in strong SD dependence on slice thickness. Our model also predicts that the velocity of SD propagation is not dependent on its initiation, but instead on tissue properties, including the amount of extracellular space and the total area of neuronal membrane, suggesting faster SD following ischemic stroke or traumatic brain injury.",

Two convolutional neural networks (CNN) were developed to automatically segment PAs and exclude surface vessels. Real-life scans with MC and without MC (NoMC) were performed to evaluate the MC performance. Motion score was calculated from the range of translational and rotational motion parameters. MC vs NoMC pairs were divided according to their score differences into groups with similar, less, or more motions during MC. Data reacquisition was also performed to evaluate whether it can further improve PA visualization.\n\nResultsIn the group with similar motion, more PA counts (NPA) were obtained with MC in 9 (60%) cases, significantly more than the number of cases (1) with less PAs (p = 0.011; binomial test). In the group with less motion during MC, MC images had more or similar NPA in all cases, while in the group with more motion during MC, the numbers of cases with less and more NPA during MC were not significantly different (3 vs 0). Data reacquisition did not further increase NPA. CNNs had higher sensitivity (0.85) and accuracy (Dice coefficient 0.85) of detecting PAs than a threshold based method.\n\nConclusionsProspective MC and CNN based segmentation improved the visualization and delineation of PAs in PC MRI at 7 T.",

In that context, this paper illustrates the development of a high accuracy algorithm for the detection of right whales in sub-meter resolution multispectral satellite imagery with the constraint of a relatively small sample support of 580 southern right whale images. A significant space is devoted to exploratory data analysis to describe the statistical structure of right whale pixels and ocean surface pixels across multispectral bands.\n\nObservations of southern right whale in satellite imagery are divided into typical and atypical right whale forms and the first observations of right whale mother and calf pairs in satellite imagery are presented. Measurements of whales are furthermore automatically extracted from whale observations (major axis length, minor axis length, etc). A significant space is also devoted to statistical data exploration, a step frequently overlooked in machine learning solutions, that yet offers interesting insight into the structure of animal detection in satellite imagery. The extracted statistics can readily be used by researchers to develop detection solutions even with low sample support. The adopted solution for detection consists of feature extraction with a convolutional neural network followed by classification with a support vector machine. 20 different convolutional neural networks were tested for feature extraction. Biostatistics parameters (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision) were measured for comparison. Most architectures generally achieved high performance with low false positive and false negative rates. 100% accuracy is achieved in the case of 2 convolutional neural networks, Nasnet Large and Inception V3, and only with a specific selection of multispectral bands.\n\nNB: This is a preprint that does not include satellite imagery due recent reviews",

    "abstract": "Burgeoning pieces of evidence support the idea that differences in the properties of large-scale cortical networks underlie perceptual variability. Here, employing psychophysical experiments in tandem with electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, we explored the inter-individual and inter-trial differences in McGurk percept to probe the underlying brain dynamics before (prestimulus) and after (poststimulus) the stimulus presentation. Initially, based on our participants (n = 18) overall susceptibility to the McGurk effect, we categorized them into two groups - rare and frequent groups of perceivers. Subsequently, we investigated the differences in their neuronal dynamics manifested in the oscillatory properties of the prestimulus and compared it with the poststimulus EEG signals during the McGurk perception (audio- /pa/, video- /ka/) and, also during the perception of the congruent audiovisual (AV) stimuli (syllables /pa/, /ta/, and /ka/). We primarily focused on the power spectrum components (periodic oscillations and aperiodic components) and global coherence. At the inter-individual and inter-trial level, we observed that for the prestimulus duration, the rare perceivers aperiodic (or \"background\" 1/f) component elicited a lower beta band (15-30 Hz) and gamma band (31-45 Hz) activity than the frequent group of perceivers. Moreover, the periodic oscillations for the rare group showed significance in the alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta bands during the prestimulus time window. Rare perceivers also showed an increased global coherence in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha, and beta bands but a lower gamma band activity than the frequent perceivers. Finally, rare perceivers elicited higher cross-hemispheric connectivity (imaginary coherence) than the frequent group at the source across different frequency bands, supporting the notion that the fluctuations in the distributed large-scale network underlie the perceptual variability in speech across individuals.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in memory are seen as a canonical sign of ageing and a prodrome to dementia in older adults. However, the nature of cognitive and brain changes across a wider aperture of adulthood is not well known. We quantify the relationship between cognitive function and brain morphology from mid-life to older adulthood, and the influence of age, sex, amyloid and genetic risk for dementia. We analyzed three observational cohorts (PISA, AIBL, ADNI) with cognitive, genetic and neuroimaging measures comprising a total of 1570 healthy mid-life and older adults (mean age 72, range 49-90 years, 1330 males) and 1365 age- and sex-matched adults with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimers disease. Among healthy adults, we find robust modes of co-variation between regional sulcal width and multidomain cognitive function that change from mid-life to the older age range. The most prominent cortical changes in mid-life are predominantly associated with changes in executive functions, whereas they are most strongly associated with poorer memory function in older age. These cognitive changes are accompanied by an age-dependent pattern of sulcal widening. Amyloid exerts a weak, but significant, influence on cognition, but not on sulcal width. The APOE {varepsilon}4 allele also exerts a weak influence on cognition, but only significantly in the (larger and older) AIBL cohort. These findings provide new insights into brain and cognition in mid-life and older adults, suggesting that cognitive screening in mid-life cohorts should encompass executive functions as well as memory.",

Immune cell activation requires increased glucose consumption, consequently limiting glucose availability for other cell types like keratinocytes. In psoriasis Hsa-microRNA-31-5p (miR-31) is highly expressed in keratinocytes. Here we show that miR-31 expression in keratinocytes is induced by limited glucose availability and increases survival under limiting glucose conditions, by increasing glutamine metabolism. In addition, miR-31 induced glutamine metabolism results in secretion of specific metabolites (aspartate and glutamate) but also immuno-modulatory factors. We show that this miR-31-induced secretory phenotype is sufficient to induce Th17 cell differentiation, a hallmark of psoriasis. Inhibition of glutaminase (GLS) using CB-839 impedes miR31-induced metabolic rewiring and secretion of immuno-modulatory factors. Concordantly, pharmacological targeting of GLS alleviated psoriasis pathology in a mouse model of psoriasis. Together our data illustrate an emerging concept of metabolic interaction across cell compartments that characterizes disease development, which can be employed to design effective treatment options for disease, as shown here for psoriasis.",

    "abstract": "Butterfly wings exhibit a diversity of patterns which can vary between forewings and hindwings and spatially across the same wing. Regulation of morphological variation involves changes in how genes are expressed across different spatial scales which is driven by chromatin dynamics during development. How patterns of chromatin dynamics correspond to morphological variation remains unclear. Here we compared the chromatin landscape between forewings and hindwings and also across the proximal and distal regions of the hindwings in two butterfly species, Bicyclus anynana and Danaus plexippus. We found that the chromatin profile varied significantly between the different wing regions, however, there was no clear correspondence between the chromatin profile and the wing patterns. In some cases, wing regions with different phenotypes shared the same chromatin profile whereas those with a similar phenotype had a different profile. We also found that in the forewing, open chromatin regions (OCRs) were AT rich whereas those in the hindwing were GC rich. GC content of the OCRs also varied between the proximal and hindwing regions. These differences in GC content were also reflected in the transcription factor binding motifs that were differentially enriched between the wings and wing regions. Our results suggest that distinct wing patterns may result from the interaction of pioneer factors, including Hox genes, differentially opening chromatin in different wings and wing regions and cooperating with other transcriptions factors, that show preferences for specific GC content, to function either as activator or repressors of nearby genes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable scientists to measure molecular data at high-resolutions and hold the promise to substantially improve clinical outcomes through personalised medicine. However, due to a lack of tools specifically designed to represent each sample (e.g. patient) from the collection of cells sequenced, disease outcome prediction on the sample level remains a challenging task. Here, we present scFeatures, a tool that creates interpretable molecular representation of single-cell and spatial data using 17 types of features motivated by current literature. The feature types span across six distinct categories including cell type proportions, cell type specific gene expressions, cell type specific pathway scores, cell type specific cell-cell interaction scores, overall aggregated gene expressions and spatial metrics. By generating molecular representation using scFeatures for single-cell RNA-seq, spatial proteomic and spatial transcriptomic data, we demonstrate that different types of features are important for predicting different disease outcomes in different datasets and the downstream analysis of features uncover novel biological discoveries.",

    "abstract": "Iron deficiency is linked to worse clinical status and outcomes in heart failure. Although metabolic syndrome contributes to the development of heart failure, the impact of iron deficiency in heart failure complicated with metabolic syndrome remains obscure. KKAy mice were used as a model of metabolic syndrome. Four-week-old male C57BL/6J and KKAy mice were fed either a normal diet or iron-restricted (IR) diet for 12 weeks. During the experiment, 40% of mice died due to pulmonary congestion in KKAy mice with IR diet (KKAy-IR), while no mice died in other groups. Necropsy showed the presence of multiple white lesions on the cardiac surface in those KKAy-IR mice. Echocardiography and histological analyses revealed that KKAy-IR mice exhibited cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac dysfunction with cardiac calcification. Cardiac mRNA of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase-1 (Enpp1), a key enzyme for bone mineralization, was highly abundant in KKAy-IR mice. Of note, iron restriction-induced cardiac calcification and dysfunction were attenuated by etidronate, an inhibitor of bone mineralization, with decreased cardiac Enpp1 mRNA abundance in KKAy-IR mice. In conclusion, iron deficiency leads to ectopic cardiac calcification and dysfunction with the increase of Enpp1 in metabolic syndrome model mice.",

    "abstract": "Increasing evidence suggests the protein arginine methyltransferase PRMT5 as a contributor to tumorigenesis in various cancer types and several inhibitors have entered clinical trials. Robust assays to determine cellular target engagement and selectivity are an important asset for the optimisation of inhibitors and the design of relevant in vivo studies. Here we report a suite of chemical biology assays enabling quantitative assessment of PRMT5 inhibitor in-cell target engagement and global selectivity profiling using a representative set of inhibitors. With the help of a bespoke cellular probe, we assess inhibitor target occupancy in cells in relation to biochemical and functional cellular assays. Investigating the influence of SAM, the natural cofactor of PRMT5, our results support the hypothesis that SAM positively contributes to the engagement of substrate-competitive inhibitors via a PRMT5:SAM:inhibitor ternary complex. Extensive proteomic profiling studies by drug affinity chromatography and thermal profiling further indicate high specificity of the clinical PRMT5 inhibitor GSK3326595 (pemrametostat).\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=65 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/477145v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (16K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11e448org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a27194org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cec270org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3f76aa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The human brain is a complex, three-dimensional structure. To better recapitulate brain complexity, recent efforts have focused on the development of human specific midbrain organoids. Human iPSC-derived midbrain organoids consist of differentiated and functional neurons, which contain active synapses, as well as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. However, the absence of microglia, with their ability to remodel neuronal networks and phagocytose apoptotic cells and debris, represents a major disadvantage for the current midbrain organoid systems. Additionally, neuro-inflammation related disease modeling is not possible in the absence of microglia. So far, no studies about the effects of human iPSC-derived microglia on midbrain organoid neural cells have been published. Here we describe an approach to derive microglia from human iPSCs and integrate them into iPSC-derived midbrain organoids. Using single nuclear RNA Sequencing, we provide a detailed characterization of microglia in midbrain organoids as well as the influence of their presence on the other cells of the organoids. Furthermore, we describe the effects that microglia have on cell death and oxidative stress- related gene expression. Finally, we show that microglia in midbrain organoids affect synaptic remodeling and increase neuronal excitability. Altogether, we show a more suitable system to further investigate brain development, as well as neurodegenerative diseases and neuro- inflammation.\n\nMain Points- Macrophage precursors can be efficiently co-cultured with midbrain organoids, they integrate into the tissue and differentiate into microglia in 3D.\n- Organoids containing microglia have a smaller size and show a down-regulation of oxidative stress-related genes.\n- Organoids co-cultured with microglia show differences in genes related to synaptic remodeling and action potential, as well as a more spontaneous action potential firing.",

    "abstract": "Upon activation, mast cells rapidly release preformed inflammatory mediators from large cytoplasmic granules via regulated exocytosis. This acute degranulation is followed by a late activation phase involving synthesis and secretion of cytokines, growth factors and other inflammatory molecules via the constitutive pathway that remains ill-defined. Here we describe a role for an insulin-responsive vesicle-like endosomal compartment, marked by insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP), in the secretion of TNF-- and IL-6 in mast cells and macrophages. IRAP-deficient mice are protected from TNF--dependent kidney injury and inflammatory arthritis. In the absence of IRAP, TNF- fails to be efficiently exported from the Golgi. Subsequently, reduced co-localization of VAMP3+ endosomes with Stx4 was observed, while VAMP8-dependent exocytosis of secretory granules was facilitated. Chemical targeting of IRAP+ endosomes reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion thereby highlighting this compartment as a promising target for the therapeutic control of inflammation.",

    "abstract": "In contrast to ecological speciation, where reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of divergent natural selection, speciation by parallel natural selection has been less thoroughly studied. To test whether parallel evolution drives speciation, we leveraged the repeated evolution of benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine stickleback fish and estimated fitness for pure crosses and within-ecotype hybrids in semi-natural ponds and in laboratory aquaria. In ponds, we detected hybrid breakdown in both ecotypes but this was counterbalanced by heterosis and the strength of post-zygotic isolation was nil. In aquaria, we detected heterosis only in limnetic crosses and breakdown in neither ecotype, suggesting that hybrid incompatibilities are environment-dependent for both ecotypes and that heterosis is environment-dependent in benthic crosses. Heterosis and breakdown were 3x greater in limnetic crosses than in benthic crosses, contrasting the prediction that the fitness consequences of hybridization should be greater in crosses among more derived ecotypes. Consistent with a primary role for stochastic processes, patterns differed among crosses between populations from different lakes. Yet, we observed qualitatively similar patterns of heterosis and hybrid breakdown in benthic crosses and limnetic crosses when averaging the lake pairs, suggesting that the outcome of hybridization is repeatable in a general sense.",

    "abstract": "Abstract / SummaryThe absence of dystrophin in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) disrupts the dystrophin dystroglycan glycoprotein complex (DGC) resulting in fibers fragility and atrophy, associated with fibrosis and microtubules and neuromuscular junction (NMJ) disorganization. The specific non-conventional cytoplasmic histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) was previously shown to regulate acetylcholine receptor distribution and muscle atrophy. Here we show that administration of the HDAC6 specific inhibitor tubastatin A to the DMD mouse model mdx improves muscle strength, restores microtubules, NMJ and DGC organization, and reduces muscle atrophy and fibrosis. These effects involve the known action of HDAC6 on microtubules acetylation and muscle atrophy but also involve a yet undiscovered action of HDAC6 on transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) signaling. Conversely, to inhibitors of nuclear HDACs that regulate TGF-{beta} signaling via the activation of Follistatin expression, HDAC6 inhibition acts downstream of TGF-{beta} ligands and receptors by increasing Smad2/3 acetylation in the cytoplasm which in turn inhibits its phosphorylation and transcriptional activity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA-seq has emerged as an innovative technology used to study complex tissues and characterize cell types, states, and lineages at a single-cell level. Classification of bulk tumors by their individual cellular constituents has also created new opportunities to generate single-cell atlases for many organs, cancers, and developmental models. Despite the tremendous promise of this technology, recent evidence studying epithelial tissues and diverse carcinomas suggests the methods used for tissue processing, cell disaggregation, and preservation can significantly bias gene expression and alter the observed cell types. To determine whether sarcomas - tumors of mesenchymal origin - are subject to the same technical artifacts, we profiled patient-derived tumor explants (PDXs) propagated from three aggressive subtypes: osteosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma (ES), desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). Given the rarity of these sarcoma subtypes, we explored whether single-nuclei RNA-seq from more widely available archival frozen specimens could accurately be identified by gene expression signatures linked to tissue phenotype or pathognomonic fusion proteins.\n\nResultsWe systematically assessed dissociation methods across different sarcoma subtypes. We compared gene expression from single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-sequencing of 125,831 whole-cells and nuclei from ES, DSRCT, and osteosarcoma PDXs. We detected warm dissociation artifacts in single-cell samples and gene length bias in single-nucleus samples. Classic sarcoma gene signatures were observed regardless of dissociation method. In addition, we showed that dissociation method biases can be computationally corrected.\n\nConclusionsWe highlighted transcriptional biases, including warm dissociation and gene-length biases, introduced by the dissociation method for various sarcoma subtypes. This work is the first to characterize how the dissociation methods used for sc/snRNA-seq may affect the interpretation of the molecular features in sarcoma PDXs.",
