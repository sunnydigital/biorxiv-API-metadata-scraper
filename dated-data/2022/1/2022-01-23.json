    "abstract": "Antigen presenting cells (APCs) have been extensively studied for treating cancers and autoimmune diseases. Dendritic cells (DCs) are potent APCs that uptake and present antigens (Ags) to activate immunity or tolerance. Despite their active use in cellular immunotherapies, DCs face several challenges that hinder clinical translation, such as inability to control Ag dosing for tuning immune responses and low abundance in peripheral blood. B cells are a potential alternative to DCs, but their poor non-specific Ag uptake capabilities compromise controllable priming of T cells. We developed phospholipid-conjugated Ags (L-Ags) and lipid-polymer hybrid nanoparticles (L/P-Ag NPs) as Ag delivery platforms to expand the range of accessible APCs for use in priming CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. These delivery platforms were evaluated using DCs, CD40-activated B cells, and resting B cells as a diverse set of APCs to understand the impact of various Ag delivery mechanisms for generation of Ag-specific T cell responses. L-Ag delivery (termed depoting) of MHC class I and II-restricted Ags successfully loaded all APC types in a tunable manner and primed both Ag-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respectively. Incorporating L-Ags and polymer-conjugated Ags (P-Ag) into NPs can direct Ags to different uptake pathways to engineer the dynamics of presentation and shape T cell responses. DCs were capable of processing and presenting Ag delivered from both L- and P-Ag NPs yet B cells could only utilize Ag delivered from L-Ag NPs. Multivariate analysis of cytokines secreted from APC:T cell co-cultures indicated that L-Ag NPs primed different T cell responses than P-Ag NPs. Altogether, we show that L-Ags and P-Ags can be rationally paired within a single NP to leverage distinct delivery mechanisms to access multiple Ag processing pathways in two APC types, offering a modular delivery platform for engineering immunotherapies.",

    "abstract": "Alphaviruses are a diverse genus of arboviruses capable of infecting many vertebrates including humans. Human infection is common in equatorial and subtropical regions and is often accompanied by arthralgia or encephalitis depending on viral lineage. No antivirals or vaccines have been approved, and many alphavirus lineages have only recently been discovered and classified. Alphavirus nsP2 protease is an important virulence factor yet is commonly thought to be a simple papain-like protease which only cleaves viral polyproteins. Here, I reveal novel molecular mechanisms of these proteases via sequence and predicted structure alignment and propose novel cellular mechanisms for the pathogenesis of viral arthritis by predicting which human proteins are likely cleaved by these proteases. In addition to the known primary cysteine mechanism in all alphaviruses and a secondary serine mechanism documented in chikungunya virus (CHIKV), I discovered secondary cysteine and threonine mechanisms exist in many other alphaviruses and that these secondary mechanisms coevolve with their viral polyprotein cleavages. As for cleavage prediction, neural networks trained on 93 different putative viral polyprotein cleavages achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.965, and, when applied to the human proteome, predicted that hundreds of proteins may be vulnerable. Notable pathways likely affected by cleavages include the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, antiproteases, protein translation/folding/glycosylation/ubiquitination, cellular differentiation, inflammation, and vesicle trafficking, hinting that this viral protease is a more important virulence factor than previously believed.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells in similar functional states are found in all glioblastoma, despite the genomic heterogeneity observed between and within these brain tumors. Metabolism being downstream of all signaling pathways regulating cell behaviors, we looked for metabolic weaknesses in link with motility, a key functional state for glioblastoma aggressiveness. A signature-driven data reduction approach highlighted motile cells present in thirty tumors from four independent single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Analyses integrating trajectory modeling disclosed, as characteristic of motile cells, enhanced oxidative stress coupled with mobilization of the cysteine metabolism enzyme 3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST). The soundness of this prediction was verified using migration and invasion assays with patient-derived cells and tissue organoids. Pharmacological and genetic manipulations showed that enhanced ROS production and MPST activity are required for the cells motility. Biochemical assays indicated that MPST acts by protecting protein cysteine residues from dismal hyperoxidation. In vivo, MPST knockdown translated in reduced tumor burden, and a robust increase in mice survival. These results show that enhanced oxidative stress coupled with MPST mobilization plays a key role in glioblastoma cell motility.",

Moreover, other useful factors such as Critical Rate (CR) and Warning Rate (WR) are defined to determine the status of AD progression. To get exact insight into the neuron-to-neuron communications, the model is obtained for a 3x3 neuron system to investigate the influence of drug injection on the reduction of AR, CR, and WR factors. It is shown that using drugs can decrease AR and CR factors and also enhance the WR.

    "abstract": "Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (7nAChRs) are activated in response to inflammation and modulate pain in humans and rodent models. The use of 7nAChRs agonists as a therapeutic option for inflammation and pain is challenged by unwanted effects resulting from constant activation and/or desensitization of 7nAChRs. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) represent a compelling alternative as they increase endogenous nicotinic transmission but do not result in progressive desensitization or loss of receptor function. In the present study, we evaluated the function of the 4R tobacco cembranoid (4R) as a PAM of 7nAChR that reduces inflammation and pain-related behaviors in mouse models of inflammatory pain. Our electrophysiological experiments show that 4R potentiates choline-evoked currents in SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing 7nAChRs in a dose-dependent manner. At the behavioral level, we show that subcutaneous administration of 4R decreases inflammation-induced thermal but not tactile hypersensitivity or formalin-induced spontaneous nociceptive responses in both male and female mice. We further show reduced inflammation-induced paw edema in 4R-treated males, with no measurable effect observed in female mice. Altogether, the results from the experiments in this study identify 4R as a PAM of 7nAChRs that reduces thermal hypersensitivity in male and female mice and inflammation in a sex-specific manner. These findings highlight the use of 4R as a potential novel treatment strategy for pain and inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic stimulation efficacy is largely dependent upon coil position and orientation. A good method for describing coil placement is required for both computational optimization (planning) and actual placement (implementation). In coordinate dependent parameter-spaces (CDPs), three-dimensional coordinates are used to represent coil position and three orthogonal unit vectors are used to represent coil orientation. A CDP can precisely describe arbitrary coil placement; therefore it offers great advantage in computational optimization which checks through all possible placements. However, a neuronavigation system is usually required to accurately implement the optimized CDP parameters on a participants head. Routine clinical practice, on the other hand, often uses the International 10-20 system to describe coil placement. Although the 10-20 system can only perform modeling and placement at limited scalp landmarks, it allows the synthesis of different individuals targeting effects to find group-optimal parameters; it also allows manual placement, which is important for commonly-seen use cases without individual MRI scans and navigation devices. This study proposes a new scalp geometry based parameter-space (SGP), integrating the advantages of CDP and 10-20 methods. Our SGP 1) can quantitatively specify all possible conventional coil positions and orientations on an individuals scalp, which is important for electrical modeling and optimization, 2) maintains inter-individual correspondence, which is important for synthesizing TMS effects from different individuals and studies. 3) enables fast and simple manual implementation. Demonstration experiments were conducted to illustrate the application of an SGP-based framework for both individual and group-based optimization. A measurement experiment was performed to evaluate speed, precision and reliability of SGP-based manual implementation; results show it surpasses previous manual placement methods.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that some personality traits may link to the vulnerability to or protection for Alzheimers disease (AD). A causal mechanism underlying this relationship, however, remains largely unknown. Using 18F-Florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) binding to beta-amyloid (A{beta}) plaques, a pathological feature of AD, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we investigated pathological and functional correlates of extraversion and neuroticism in a group of healthy young and older subjects. We quantified a level of brain A{beta} deposition in older individuals. Brain activity was measured in young adults using a task-switching fMRI paradigm. When we correlated personality scores of extraversion and neuroticism with these pathological and functional measures, higher extraversion, but not neuroticism, was significantly associated with lower global A{beta} measures among older adults, accounting for age and sex. This association was present across widespread brain regions. Among young subjects, higher extraversion was associated with lower activity during task switching in anterior cingulate cortex, left anterior insular cortex, left putamen, and middle frontal gyrus bilaterally, while higher neuroticism was associated with increased activity throughout the brain. The present results suggest that possibly via efficient neuronal activity, extraversion, one of lifelong personality traits, may confer the protective mechanism against the development of A{beta} pathology during aging.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMarburg virus (MARV), an Ebola-like virus, remains an eminent threat to public health as demonstrated by its high associated mortality rate (23-90%) and recent emergence in West Africa for the first time. Although a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccine (Ervebo) is licensed for Ebola virus disease (EVD), no approved countermeasures exist against MARV. Results from clinical trials indicate Ervebo prevents EVD in 97.5-100% of vaccinees 10 days onwards post-immunization.\n\nMethodology/FindingsGiven the rapid immunogenicity of the Ervebo platform against EVD, we tested whether a similar, but highly attenuated, rVSV-based Vesiculovax vector expressing the glycoprotein (GP) of MARV (rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP) could provide swift protection against Marburg virus disease (MVD). Here, groups of cynomolgus monkeys were vaccinated 7, 5, or 3 days before exposure to a lethal dose of MARV (Angola variant). All subjects (100%) immunized one week prior to challenge survived; 80% and 20% of subjects survived when vaccinated 5- and 3-days pre-exposure, respectively. Lethality was associated with higher viral load and aberrant innate immunity signaling, whereas survival correlated with development of MARV GP-specific antibodies and early expression of NK cell-, B-cell-, and cytotoxic T-cell-related transcriptional signatures.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThese results emphasize the utility of Vesiculovax vaccines for MVD outbreak management. The highly attenuated nature of rVSV-N4CT1 vaccines, which are clinically safe in humans, may be preferable to vaccines based on the same platform as Ervebo (rVSV \"delta G\" platform), which in some trial participants induced vaccine-related adverse events in association with viral replication including arthralgia/arthritis, dermatitis, and cutaneous vasculitis.\n\nAuthor SummaryMarburg virus (MARV) is one of the deadliest viruses known to man. One of the most effective vaccines against this pathogen uses a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) platform to express MARV glycoprotein (GP) immunogen. As rVSV-based vaccines may be used as medical interventions to mitigate or prevent outbreaks of MARV, defining the time window needed to elicit protection is vital. Here, a rVSV vector expressing MARV glycoprotein (rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP) fully protected nonhuman primates from lethality and disease when given as soon as 1 week prior to exposure. At 5- and 3-days pre-exposure, partial protection (80% and 20% survival, respectively) was achieved. Vaccination with rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP appears to \"jump-start\" the immune system to allow sufficient time for MARV-specific adaptive responses to form. This fast- acting vaccine is based on a similar platform as Ervebo, the only FDA- and EU-approved vaccine for preventing Ebola virus infection. The rVSV-N4CT1-MARV-GP vaccine features additional attenuations in the rVSV backbone that may contribute to a more acceptable safety profile in vaccinees, as Ervebo in some recipients induced vaccine- related adverse events including rashes and joint pain.",

RPOC can automatically probe and control biomolecular activities and chemical processes in dynamic living samples with submicron spatial accuracy, nanoseconds response time, and high chemical specificity.",

    "abstract": "PurposeIn neurosurgery, image guidance is provided based on the patient to pre-operative data registration with a neuronavigation system. However, the brain shift phenomena invalidate the accuracy of the navigation system during neurosurgery. One of the most common approaches for brain shift compensation is using intra-operative ultrasound (iUS) imaging followed by registration of iUS with pre-operative magnetic resonance (MR) images. While, due to the unpredictable nature of brain deformation and the low quality of ultrasound images, finding a satisfactory multimodal image registration approach remains a challenging task.\n\nMethodsWe proposed a new automatic unsupervised end-to-end MR-iUS registration approach based on the Dual Discriminator Bayesian Generative Adversarial Network (D2BGAN). The proposed network consists of two discriminators and is optimized by introducing a Bayesian loss function to improve the generator functionality and adding a mutual information loss function to the discriminator for similarity measurement. An evaluation was performed using the RESECT training dataset based on the organizers manual landmarks.\n\nResultsThe mean Target Registration Error (mTRE) after MR-iUS registration using D2BGAN reached 0.75{+/-}0.3 mm. The D2BGAN illustrated a clear advantage by 85% improvement in the mTRE of MR-iUS registration over the initial error. Also, the results confirmed that the proposed Bayesian loss function rather than the typical loss function outperforms the accuracy of MR-iUS registration by 23%.\n\nConclusionThe D2BGAN improved the registration accuracy while allowing us to maintain the intensity and anatomical information of the input images in the registration process. It promotes the advancement of deep learning-based multi-modality registration techniques.",

    "abstract": "Ivermectin is a widely used antiparasitic drug and shows promising anticancer activity in various cancer types. Although multiple signaling pathways modulated by ivermectin have been identified, few studies have focused on the exact target of ivermectin. Herein, we report the pharmacological effects and direct targets of ivermectin in prostate cancer (PCa). Ivermectin caused G0/G1 arrest, induced cell apoptosis, DNA damage, and decreased androgen receptor (AR) signaling in PCa cells. Using integrated omics profiling, including RNA-seq and thermal proteome profiling, we found that the forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) repair executer Ku70/Ku80 were the direct targets of ivermectin. The binding of ivermectin and FOXA1 reduced the chromatin accessibility of AR and the G0/G1 cell cycle regulator E2F1, leading to cell proliferation inhibition. The binding of ivermectin and Ku70/Ku80 impaired the NHEJ repair ability. Cooperating with the downregulation of homologous recombination repair after AR inhibition, ivermectin triggered synthetic lethality. Our findings demonstrate the anticancer effect of ivermectin in prostate cancer, indicating that its use may be a new therapeutic approach for PCa.",

    "abstract": "Stellate cells in the medial entorhinal cortex manifest peri-threshold oscillatory patterns in their membrane voltage. Although different theoretical frameworks have been proposed to explain these activity patterns, these frameworks do not jointly account for heterogeneities in intrinsic properties of stellate cells and stochasticity in ion-channel and synaptic physiology. In this study, we first performed in vitro patch-clamp electrophysiological recordings from rat MEC stellate cells and found pronounced cell-to-cell variability in their characteristic physiological properties. We demonstrate that stochasticity introduced into either a simple nonlinear dynamical system (Hopf bifurcation) or into heterogeneous biophysical models yielded activity patterns that were qualitatively similar to peri-threshold oscillations in stellate cells. We developed five quantitative metrics for identification of valid oscillatory traces and confirmed that these metrics reliably captured the variable amplitude and non-rhythmic oscillatory patterns observed in our electrophysiological recordings. We analyzed traces from a stochastic Hopf bifurcation system for further confirmation on the reliability of these quantitative metrics in detecting oscillatory patterns. Apart from providing confirmation, these analyses provided a key insight about the manifestation of stochastic resonance in the stochastic bifurcation system, but not with theta-filtered noise. We then validated peri-threshold activity patterns obtained from a heterogeneous population of stellate cell models, with each model assessed with multiple trials of different levels and forms of noise (ion-channel, synaptic, and additive) at different membrane depolarizations. Strikingly, the validation process confirmed the manifestation of heterogeneous stochastic bifurcations across all models and revealed the detection of the highest number of valid oscillatory traces at an optimal level of each form of noise. The manifestation of stochastic resonance in this heterogeneous model population explained why intrinsic theta oscillations might not be observed under in vivo conditions where noise levels are typically high. Together, we provide several lines of evidence that demonstrate heterogeneous stochastic bifurcations as a unifying framework that fully explains peri-threshold oscillatory patterns in stellate cells and argue for state-dependence in the manifestation of these oscillations.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac manifestations are commonly observed in COVID-19 patients and prominently contributed to overall mortality. Human myocardium could be infected by SARS-CoV-2, and human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, molecular mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 gene-induced injury and dysfunction of human CMs remain elusive. Here, we find overexpression of three SARS-CoV-2 coding genes, Nsp6, Nsp8 and M, could globally compromise transcriptome of hPSC-CMs. Integrated transcriptomic analyses of hPSC-CMs infected by SARS-CoV-2 with hPSC-CMs of Nsp6, Nsp8 or M overexpression identified concordantly activated genes enriched into apoptosis and immune/inflammation responses, whereas reduced genes related to heart contraction and functions. Further, Nsp6, Nsp8 or M overexpression induce prominent apoptosis and electrical dysfunctions of hPSC-CMs. Global interactome analysis find Nsp6, Nsp8 and M all interact with ATPase subunits, leading to significantly reduced cellular ATP level of hPSC-CMs. Finally, we find two FDA-approved drugs, ivermectin and meclizine, could enhance the ATP level, and ameliorate cell death and dysfunctions of hPSC-CMs overexpressing Nsp6, Nsp8 or M. Overall, we uncover the global detrimental impacts of SARS-CoV-2 genes Nsp6, Nsp8 and M on the whole transcriptome and interactome of hPSC-CMs, define the crucial role of ATP level reduced by SARS-CoV-2 genes in CM death and functional abnormalities, and explore the potentially pharmaceutical approaches to ameliorate SARS-CoV-2 genes-induced CM injury and abnormalities.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogens, especially those responsible for emerging infectious diseases, are transmitted in a host community. How the host community structure affects an epidemic is still debated, particularly whether increasing the host community complexity would tend to amplify or dilute the incidence of an epidemic in a target population, e.g. humans or cattle. In this paper, we build a stochastic SIR model and compare epidemiological dynamics in a target population between three simple host community structures with an increasing complexity. Globally, our results show two possible main outcomes. First, an intermediate host can have a diluting effect by preventing the direct transmission from hosts to the target population, thus reducing the prevalence of infection. Second, when two sources of infection are considered, the effects of the epidemic are generally amplified. By highlighting that the structure of the ecological hosts network can dramatically affect epidemics, our results may have implications for the control of emerging infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "The sensory epithelium of the inner ear, found in all extant lineages of vertebrates, has been subjected to over 500 million years of evolution, resulting in the complex inner ear of modern vertebrates. Inner-ear adaptations are as diverse as the species in which they are found, and such unique anatomical variations have been well studied. However, the evolutionary details of the molecular machinery that are required for hearing are less well known. Two molecules that are essential for hearing in vertebrates are cadherin-23 and protocadherin-15, proteins whose interaction with one another acts as the focal point of force transmission when converting sound waves into electrical signals that the brain can interpret. This interaction exists in every lineage of vertebrates, but little is known about the structure or mechanical properties of these proteins in most non-mammalian lineages. Here, we use various techniques to characterize the evolution of this protein interaction. Results show how evolutionary sequence changes in this complex affect its biophysical properties both in simulations and experiments, with variations in interaction strength and dynamics among extant vertebrate lineages. Evolutionary simulations also characterize how the biophysical properties of the complex in turn constrain its evolution and provide a possible explanation for the increase in deafness-causing mutants observed in cadherin-23 relative to protocadherin-15. Together, these results suggest a general picture of tip-link evolution in which selection acted to modify the tip-link interface, while subsequent neutral evolution combined with varying degrees of purifying selection drove additional diversification in modern tetrapods.",

    "abstract": "Classic population genetics theory has been fundamental to understanding the evolution of sex-differences and the maintenance of sexually antagonistic (SA) genetic variation, but these models have rarely considered the demographic consequences of intralocus sexual antagonism. In this paper we develop a stage-structured mendelian matrix model and jointly analyze the evolutionary and demographic consequences of SA selection in obligately outcrossing (i.e., dioecious/gonochorous) and partially selfing hermaphrodite populations. We focus on identifying parameter conditions under which SA polymorphism is maintained and the population growth rate remains positive. Additionally, we analyze the effects of inbreeding depression manifesting at different life-history stages and give an illustrative example of the potential for SA polymorphism in real populations using empirically estimated demographic rates for the hermaphroditic flowering plant Mimulus guttatus. Our results show that when population intrinsic growth rates approach one, extinction occurs across large swathes of parameter space favoring SA polymorphism or the fixation of male-beneficial alleles, and that inbreeding depression is a significant problem for maintaining SA polymorphism in partially selfing populations. Despite these demographic challenges, our example with M. guttatus appears to show that demographic rates observed in some real populations are capable of sustaining large regions of viable SA polymorphic space.",
