    "abstract": "Neuronal ensembles are coactive groups of cortical neurons, found in spontaneous and evoked activity, that can mediate perception and behavior. To understand the mechanisms that lead to the formation of ensembles, we co-activated optogenetically and electrically layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices from mouse visual cortex, in animals from both sexes, replicating in vitro an optogenetic protocol to generate ensembles in vivo. Using whole-cell and perforated patch-clamp pair recordings we find that, after optogenetic or electrical stimulation, coactivated neurons increase their correlation in spontaneous activity, a hallmark of ensemble formation. Coactivated neurons showed small biphasic changes in presynaptic plasticity, with an initial depression followed by a potentiation after a recovery period. Unexpectedly, optogenetic and electrical stimulation-induced significant increases in frequency and amplitude of spontaneous EPSPs, even after single-cell stimulation. In addition, we observed strong and persistent increases in neuronal excitability after stimulation, with increases in membrane resistance and reduction in spike threshold. A pharmacological agent that blocks changes in membrane resistance can revert this effect. These significant increases in excitability may partly explain the observed biphasic synaptic plasticity. We propose that cell-intrinsic changes in excitability are involved in the formation of neuronal ensembles. We propose an \"iceberg\" model, by which increased neuronal excitability makes subthreshold connections suprathreshold, enhancing the effect of already existing synapses, and generating a new neuronal ensemble.\n\nSignificance StatementWe investigated the synaptic and cellular mechanisms underlying the formation of neuronal ensembles, i.e., spontaneously coactive groups of neurons. Using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetic in slices of mouse neocortex we replicated a protocol that generates ensembles in vivo. After optogenetic and electrical stimulation, we observed biphasic synaptic plasticity and, unexpectedly, major increases in excitability, input resistance, and reductions in firing threshold. The increased excitability can explain the observed synaptic plasticity. Our results reveal a major role for intrinsic excitability in the establishment of neuronal ensembles.",

    "abstract": "Background and PurposeP2X receptors (P2XRs) are trimeric ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) that open a cation-selective pore in response to ATP binding to their large extracellular domain (ECD). The seven known P2XR subtypes can assemble as homo- or heterotrimeric complexes and contribute to numerous physiological functions, including nociception, inflammation and hearing. The overall structure of P2XRs is well established, but little is known about the spectrum and prevalence of human genetic variations and the functional implications in specific domains.\n\nExperimental ApproachHere we examine the impact of P2X2 receptor (P2X2R) inter-subunit interface missense variants identified in the human population or through structural predictions. We test both single and double mutants through electrophysiological and biochemical approaches.\n\nKey resultsWe demonstrate that predicted ECD inter-subunit interfaces display a higher-than-expected density of missense variations and that the majority of mutations that disrupt putative inter-subunit interactions result in channels with higher apparent ATP affinity. Lastly, we show that double mutants at the subunit interface show significant energetic coupling, especially if located in close proximity.\n\nConclusions and ImplicationsWe provide the first structural mapping of the mutational burden across the human population in a LGIC and show that the density of missense mutations is constrained between protein domains, indicating evolutionary selection at the domain level. Our data may indicate that, unlike other LGICs, P2X2Rs have evolved an intrinsically high threshold for activation, possibly to allow for additional modulation or as a cellular protection mechanism against overstimulation.\n\nBullet point summary What is already known: O_LIP2X2 receptors are ATP-activated ion channels implicated in hearing and nociceptice pathways\nC_LI\n What this study adds: O_LIA structural mapping of missense variants observed in the human population\nC_LIO_LIWe identify the intersubunit-interface as a variant hotspot and decipher functional impact of mutations\nC_LI\n Clinical significance: O_LIThe development of both inhibitors and activators of P2X2 receptor function may be required\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "How concepts are coded in the brain is a core issue in cognitive neuroscience. Studies have focused on how individual concepts are processed, but the way in which conceptual representation changes to suit the context is unclear. We parametrically manipulated the association strength between words, presented in pairs one word at a time using a slow event-related fMRI design. We combined representational similarity analysis and computational linguistics to probe the neurocomputational content of these trials. Individual word meaning was maintained in supramarginal gyrus (associated with verbal short-term memory) when items were judged to be unrelated, but not when a linking context was retrieved. Context-dependent meaning was instead represented in left lateral prefrontal gyrus (associated with controlled retrieval), angular gyrus and ventral temporal lobe (regions associated with integrative aspects of memory). Analyses of informational connectivity, examining the similarity of activation patterns across trials between sites, showed that control network regions had more similar multivariate responses across trials when association strength was weak, reflecting a common controlled retrieval state when the task required more unusual associations. These findings indicate that semantic control and representational sites amplify contextually-relevant meanings in trials judged to be related.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental principle of biological motor control is that the neural commands driving movement must conform to the response properties of the motor plants they control. In the oculomotor system, characterizations of oculomotor plant dynamics traditionally supported models in which the plant responds to neural drive to extraocular muscles on exclusively short, subsecond timescales. These models predict that the stabilization of gaze during fixations between saccades requires neural drive that approximates eye position on longer timescales and is generated through the temporal integration of brief eye velocity-encoding signals that cause saccades. However, recent measurements of oculomotor plant behaviour have revealed responses on longer timescales. Furthermore, measurements of firing patterns in the oculomotor integrator have revealed a more complex encoding of eye movement dynamics. Yet, the link between these observations has remained unclear. Here we use measurements from the larval zebrafish to link dynamics in the oculomotor plant to dynamics in the neural integrator. The oculomotor plant in both anaesthetized and awake larval zebrafish was characterized by a broad distribution of response timescales, including those much longer than one second. Analysis of the firing patterns of oculomotor integrator neurons, which exhibited a broadly distributed range of decay time constants, demonstrates the sufficiency of this activity for stabilizing gaze given an oculomotor plant with distributed response timescales. This work suggests that leaky integration on multiple, distributed timescales by the oculomotor integrator reflects an inverse model for generating oculomotor commands, and that multi-timescale dynamics may be a general feature of motor circuitry.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LIRecent observations of oculomotor plant response properties and neural activity across the oculomotor system have called into question classical formulations of both the oculomotor plant and the oculomotor integrator.\nC_LIO_LIHere we use measurements from new and published experiments in the larval zebrafish together with modelling to reconcile recent oculomotor plant observations with oculomotor integrator function.\nC_LIO_LIWe developed computational techniques to characterize oculomotor plant responses over several seconds in awake animals, demonstrating that long timescale responses seen in anesthetized animals extend to the awake state.\nC_LIO_LIAnalysis of firing patterns of oculomotor integrator neurons demonstrates the sufficiency of this activity for stabilizing gaze given an oculomotor plant with multiple, distributed response timescales.\nC_LIO_LIOur results support a formulation of gaze stabilization by the oculomotor system in which commands for stabilizing gaze are generated through integration on multiple, distributed timescales.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Fluctuations in strategy, attention, or motivation can cause large variability in performance across task trials. Typically, this variability is treated as noise, and assumed to cancel out, leaving supposedly stable relationships among behavior, neural activity, and experimental task conditions. Those relationships, however, could change with a participants internal cognitive states, and variability in performance may carry important information regarding those states, which cannot be directly measured. Therefore, we used a mathematical, state-space modeling framework to estimate internal states from measured behavioral data, quantifying each participants sensitivity to factors such as past errors or distractions, to predict their reaction time fluctuations. We show how modeling these states greatly improves trial-by-trial prediction of behavior. Further, we identify EEG functional connectivity features that modulate with each state. These results illustrate the potential of this approach and how it could enable quantification of intra- and inter-individual differences and provide insight into their neural bases.\n\nStatement of RelevanceCognitive behavioral performance and its neural bases vary both across individuals and within individuals over time. Understanding this variability may be key to the success of clinical or educational interventions. Internal cognitive states reflecting differences in strategy, attention, and motivation may drive much of these inter- and intra-individual differences, but often cannot be reliably controlled or measured in cognitive neuroscience research. The mathematical modeling framework developed here uses measured data to estimate a participants dynamic, internal cognitive states, with each state derived from specific factors hypothesized to affect attention, motivation or strategy. The results highlight potential sources of behavioral variability and reveal EEG features that modulate with each state. Our method quantifies and characterizes individual behavioral differences and highlights their underlying neural mechanisms, which could be used for future targeted training or neuromodulation therapies to improve cognitive performance.",

    "abstract": "The general mechanisms by which ESCRTs are specifically recruited to various membranes, and how ESCRT subunits are spatially organized remain central questions in cell biology. At the endosome and lysosomes, ubiquitination of membrane proteins triggers ESCRT-mediated substrate recognition and degradation. Using the yeast lysosome/vacuole, we define the principles by which substrate engagement by ESCRTs occurs at this organelle. We find that multivalent interactions between ESCRT-0 and polyubiquitin is critical for substrate recognition at yeast vacuoles, with a lower-valency requirement for cargo engagement at endosomes. Direct recruitment of ESCRT-0 induces dynamic foci on the vacuole membrane, and forms fluid condensates in vitro with polyubiquitin. We propose that self-assembly of early ESCRTs induces condensation, an initial step in ESCRT-assembly/nucleation at membranes. This property can be tuned specifically at various organelles by modulating the number of binding interactions.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCondensation of multivalent ESCRT-0/polyubiquitin assemblies organizes cargo sorting reactions at lysosomes",

    "abstract": "iCn3D was initially developed as a web-based 3D molecular viewer. It then evolved from visualization into a full-featured interactive structural analysis software. It became a collaborative research instrument through the sharing of permanent, shortened URLs that encapsulate not only annotated visual molecular scenes, but also all underlying data and analysis scripts in a FAIR manner. More recently, with the growth of structural databases, the need to analyze large structural datasets systematically led us to use Python scripts and convert the code to be used in Node.js scripts. We showed a few examples of Python scripts at https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d/tree/master/icn3dpython to export secondary structures or PNG images from iCn3D. Users just need to replace the URL in the Python scripts to export other annotations from iCn3D. Furthermore, any interactive iCn3D feature can be converted into a Node.js script to be run in batch mode, enabling an interactive analysis performed on one or a handful of protein complexes to be scaled up to analysis features of large ensembles of structures. Currently available Node.js analysis scripts examples are available at https://github.com/ncbi/icn3d/tree/master/icn3dnode. This development will enable ensemble analyses on growing structural databases such as AlphaFold or RoseTTAFold on one hand and Electron Microscopy on the other. In this paper, we also review new features such as DelPhi electrostatic potential, 3D view of mutations, alignment of multiple chains, assembly of multiple structures by realignment, dynamic symmetry calculation, 2D cartoons at different levels, interactive contact maps, and use of iCn3D in Jupyter Notebook as described at https://pypi.org/project/icn3dpy.",

Herein, we examined the role of autotaxin in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), utilizing data from ImmuNexUT, a comprehensive database consisting of transcriptome data and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data of immune cells from patients with immune-mediated disorders.\n\nMethodsSerum autotaxin concentrations in patients with SLE and healthy controls (HCs) were compared. The transcriptome data of patients with SLE and age-and sex-matched HCs were obtained from ImmuNexUT. The expression of ENPP2, the gene encoding autotaxin, was examined in peripheral blood immune cells. Next, weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to identify genes with expression patterns similar to ENPP2. The ImmuNexUT eQTL database and public epigenomic databases were used to infer the relationship between autotaxin and pathogenesis of SLE.\n\nResultsAutotaxin levels were elevated in the serum of patients with SLE compared to HCs. Furthermore, the expression of ENPP2 was higher in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) than in other immune cell subsets, and its expression was elevated in pDCs of patients with SLE compared to HCs. In WGCNA, ENPP2 belonged to a module that correlated with disease activity. This module was enriched in interferon-associated genes and included genes whose expression was influenced by single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with SLE, suggesting that it is a key module connecting genetic risk factors of SLE with disease pathogenesis. Analysis utilizing the ImmuNexUT eQTL database and public epigenomic databases suggested that the increased expression of ENPP2 in pDCs from patients with SLE may be caused by increased expression of interferon-associated genes and increased binding of STAT3 complexes to the regulatory region of ENPP2.\n\nConclusionsAutotaxin may play a critical role in connecting genetic risk factors of SLE to disease pathogenesis in pDCs.",

To estimate the relative denoising performance differences between various approaches, we compared this technique to a classic Wiener filter and to a convTasNet. Speech enhancement performance was assessed by means of signal-to-noise-ratio improvement and the short-time objective speech intelligibility measure. Additionally, 5 CI users were evaluated for speech intelligibility in noise to assess the potential benefits of each algorithm.

    "abstract": "The microbial interactions within the human microbiome are complex and temporally dynamic, but few methods are available to model this system within a longitudinal network framework. Based on general longitudinal 16S rRNA sequence data, we propose a stationary Gaussian graphical model (SGGM) for microbial interaction networks (MIN) which can accommodate the possible correlations between the high-dimensional observations. For SGGM, an EM-type algorithm is devised to compute the L1-penalized maximum likelihood estimate of MIN which employs the classic graphical LASSO algorithm as the building block and can therefore be implemented easily. Simulation studies show that the proposed algorithms can significantly outperform the conventional algorithms when the correlations between measurements grow large. The algorithms are then applied to a real 16S rRNA gene sequence data set for gut microbiome. With the estimated MIN in hand, module-preserving permutation test is proposed to test the independence of the MIN and the corresponding phylogenetic tree. The results demonstrate strong evidence of an association between the MIN and the phylogenetic tree which indicates that the genetically related taxa tend to have more/stronger interactions.

Single-channel physiology recordings at the output of the Antenna Lobe (AL) exhibit concentration-invariance and contrast-boosting properties, indicating a decoupling of the odorant object identity from the concentration waveform in steady-state while responding strongly to odorant concentration onset and offset in transient states.\n\nThrough exhaustive computational explorations of the AL circuits, we show that the steady-state and transient response features of the AL are, respectively, due to presynaptic and postsynaptic Local Neurons (LNs). Theoretical analysis reveals that the LN pathways can be modeled as parallel differential Divisive Normalization Processors (DNPs). Differential DNPs robustly extract odorant identity (semantic information) and ON/OFF odorant event-timing (syntactic information), thereby providing for the AL the functional logic of ON-OFF odorant identity recovery.",

    "abstract": "Study DesignPreclinical animal study\n\nObjectiveEvaluation of the degenerative progression resulting from either a partial- or full- width injury to the mouse lumbar intervertebral disc (IVD) using contrast-enhanced micro-computed tomography and histological analyses. We utilized a lateral-retroperitoneal surgical approach to access the lumbar IVD, and the injuries to the IVD were induced by either incising one side of the annulus fibrosus or puncturing both sides of the annulus fibrosus. The full-width injury caused dramatic reduction in nucleus pulposus hydration and significant degeneration. A partial-width injury produces localized deterioration around the annulus fibrosus that resulted in local tissue remodeling without gross degeneration to the IVD.\n\nMethodsFemale C57BL/6J mice of 3-4 months age were used in this study. They were divided into three groups to undergo partial-width, full-width, or sham injuries. The L5/L6 and L6/S1 lumbar IVDs were surgically exposed using a lateral-retroperitoneal approach. The L6/S1 IVDs were injured using either a surgical scalpel (partial-width) or a 33G needle (full-width), with the L5/L6 serving as an internal control. These animals were allowed to recover and then sacrificed at 2-, 4-, or 8-weeks post-surgery. The IVDs were assessed for degeneration using contrast-enhanced microCT (CE{micro}CT) and histological analysis.\n\nResultsThe high-resolution 3D evaluation of the IVD confirmed that the respective injuries localized within one side of the annulus fibrosus or spanned the full width of the IVD. The full-width injury caused deteriorations in the nucleus pulposus after 2 weeks and progressed to significant degeneration at 8 weeks, while the partial width injury caused localized disruptions that remained limited to the annulus fibrosus.\n\nConclusionThe use of CE{micro}CT revealed distinct IVD degeneration profiles resulting from partial- and full- width injuries. The partial width injury may serve as an alternative for IVD degeneration resulting from localized annulus fibrosus injuries in humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWithdrawal of problematic scientific articles after publication is one of the mechanisms for correcting the literature available to publishers, especially in the conditions of the ever-increasing trend of publishing activity in the medical field. The market volume and the business model justify publishers involvement in the post-publication quality control(QC) of scientific production. The limited information about this subject determined us to analyze retractions and the main retraction reasons for publishers with many withdrawn articles. We also propose a score to measure the evolution of their performance. The data set used for this article consists of 4844 PubMed retracted papers published between 1.01.2009 and 31.12.2020.\n\nMethodsWe have analyzed the retraction notes and retraction reasons, grouping them by publisher. To evaluate performance, we formulated an SDTP score whose calculation formula includes several parameters: speed (article exposure time(ET)), detection rate (percentage of articles whose retraction is initiated by the editor/publisher/institution without the authors participation), transparency (percentage of retracted articles available online and clarity of retraction notes), precision (mention of authors responsibility and percentage of retractions for reasons other than editorial errors).\n\nResultsThe 4844 withdrawn articles were published in 1767 journals by 366 publishers, the average number of withdrawn articles/journal being 2.74. Forty-five publishers have more than ten withdrawn articles, holding 88% of all papers and 79% of journals. Combining our data with data from another study shows that less than 7% of PubMed journals withdrew at least one article. Only 10.5% of the withdrawal notes included the individual responsibility of the authors. Nine of the top 11 publishers had the largest number of articles withdrawn in 2020, in the first 11 places finding, as expected, some big publishers. Retraction reasons analysis shows considerable differences between publishers concerning the articles ET: median values between 9 and 43 months (mistakes), 9 and 73 months (images), 10 and 42 months (plagiarism & overlap).\n\nThe SDTP score shows, between 2018 and 2020, an improvement in QC of four publishers in the top 11 and a decrease in the gap between 1st and 11th place. The group of the other 355 publishers also has a positive evolution of the SDTP score.\n\nConclusionsPublishers have to get involved actively and measurably in the post-publication evaluation of scientific products. The introduction of reporting standards for retraction notes and replicable indicators for quantifying publishing QC can help increase the overall quality of scientific literature.",

While the mouse model has been instrumental for our understanding of mammalian development, comparatively little is known about human and non-human primate gastrulation due to the restriction of both technical and ethical issues. Here, we present a morphological and molecular survey of spatiotemporal dynamics of cell types populating the non-human primate embryos during gastrulation. We performed serial sections of Cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) gastrulating embryos at 1-day temporal resolution from E17 to E21, and reconstructed three-dimensional digital models based on high-resolution anatomical atlas that revealed the dynamic changes in the geography of the mesoderm and primitive streaks. Spatial transcriptomics identified unique gene profiles that correspond to distinct germ layers and cross-species spatiotemporal transcriptome analysis revealed a developmental coordinate of germ layer segregation between mouse and primate. Furthermore, we identified species-specific transcription programs during gastrulation. These results offer important insights into evolutionarily conserved and divergent processes during mammalian gastrulation.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=196 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474719v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1058f45org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@105cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12362d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2e2346_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightO_LIA high-resolution anatomical atlas of Cynomolgus gastrulation embryos\nC_LIO_LICreated a three-dimensional digital template from serial sections of five developmental stages\nC_LIO_LIA two-dimensional spatiotemporal transcriptome of the germ layers of gastrulating embryos\nC_LIO_LICross-species comparison infers conservation of functional attributes of regulome and signaling activity in germ layer formation\nC_LI",

Functional fMRI studies have shown that these images activate a large-scale distributed brain network that encompasses areas in visual, temporal, and frontal cortices. The underlying spatial and temporal dynamics among these network structures, however, remain to be characterized. We recorded simultaneous EEG-fMRI data while participants passively viewed affective images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Applying multivariate pattern analysis to decode EEG data, and representational similarity analysis to fuse EEG data with simultaneously recorded fMRI data, we found that: (1) ~100 ms after picture onset, perceptual processing of complex visual scenes began in early visual cortex, proceeding to ventral visual cortex at ~160 ms, (2) between ~200 and ~300 ms (pleasant pictures: ~200 ms; unpleasant pictures: ~260 ms), affect-specific neural representations began to form, supported mainly by areas in occipital and temporal cortices, and (3) affect-specific neural representations, lasting up to ~2 s, were stable and exhibited temporally generalizable activity patterns. These results suggest that affective scene representations in the brain are formed in a valence-dependent manner and are sustained by recurrent neural interactions among distributed brain areas.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by the progressive degeneration of motor neurons accompanied by the accumulation of the morphologically and functionally altered glial cells. Reactive astrocytes and microglia secrete pro-inflammatory mediators and contribute to disease progression. Notably, oligodendrocyte functions are disrupted in ALS, including trophic support, myelination, and oligodendrocyte differentiation. ALS patients and mutant SOD1 mice models display reduced levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) contributing to impairment of oligodendrocyte function. Lactate, an active metabolite capable of moving into or out of cells, acts as a signaling molecule, transported exclusively by monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs). We showed previously, that AMD3100 increases the lactate transporter MCT1 in an animal models of Alzheimers disease (AD) and ALS.\n\nMethods and ResultsAMD3100 is a reversible antagonist of CXCR4, and therefore inhibits the CXCR4/CXCL12 axis. AMD3100 was shown to have beneficial effects on extension of SOD1G93A mice life-span and enabling migration of hematopoietic stem cells (HSPCs) from bone marrow to periphery. The low content of lactate and transporters in SOD1G93A mice model led us to propose a combined treatment with AMD3100 and exogeneous L-lactate.\n\nConclusionsThe combined treatment attenuated neuroinflammation and remyelination but did not have a significant extension of SOD1G93A mice life-span compared with AMD3100 treatment alone.",

    "abstract": "Malaria is caused by infection of the erythrocytes by the parasites Plasmodium. Inside the erythrocytes, the parasites multiply via schizogony, an unconventional cell division mode. The Inner Membrane Complex (IMC), an organelle located beneath the parasite plasma membrane, serving as the platform for protein anchorage, is essential for schizogony. So far, complete repertoire of IMC proteins and their localization determinants remain unclear. Here we used biotin ligase (TurboID)-based proximity labelling to compile the proteome of the schizont IMC of rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii. In total, 300 TurboID-interacting proteins were identified. 19 of the 22 selected candidates were confirmed to localize in the IMC, indicating good reliability. In light of the existing palmitome of Plasmodium falciparum, 83 proteins of the P. yoelii IMC proteome are potentially palmitoylated. We further identified DHHC2 as the major resident palmitoyl-acyl-transferase of the IMC. Depletion of DHHC2 led to defective schizont segmentation and growth arrest both in vitro and in vivo. DHHC2 was found to palmitoylate two critical IMC proteins CDPK1 and GAP45 for their IMC localization. In summary, this study reports an inventory of new IMC proteins and demonstrates a central role of DHHC2 in governing IMC localization of proteins during the schizont development.",

    "abstract": "Immune cells activate in a binary, switch-like fashion that involves proteins polymerizing into large complexes known as signalosomes. The switch-like nature of signalosome formation has been proposed to result from large energy barriers to polymer nucleation. Whether such nucleation barriers indeed drive binary immune responses has not yet been shown. Here, we employed an in-cell biophysical approach to dissect the assembly mechanism of the CARD-BCL10-MALT1 (CBM) signalosome, a key determinant of transcription factor NF-{kappa}B activation in both innate and adaptive immunity. We found that the adaptor protein BCL10 encodes an intrinsic nucleation barrier, and that this barrier has been conserved from cnidaria to humans. Using optogenetic tools and a single-cell transcriptional reporter of NF-{kappa}B activity, we further revealed that endogenous human BCL10 is supersaturated even in unstimulated cells, indicating that the nucleation barrier operationally stores energy for subsequent activation. We found that upon stimulation, BCL10 nucleation by CARD9 multimers triggers self-templated polymerization that saturates NF-{kappa}B activation to produce a binary response. Pathogenic mutants of CARD9 that cause human immunodeficiencies eliminated nucleating activity. Conversely, a hyperactive cancer-causing mutation in BCL10 increased its spontaneous nucleation. Our results indicate that unassembled CBM signalosome components function analogously to a spring-loaded mousetrap, constitutively poised to activate NF-{kappa}B through irrevocable polymerization. This finding may inform our understanding of the root causes and progressive nature of pathogenic and age-associated inflammation.",

Within this space, the amino acid sequence design of protein-protein interactions has still been a rather challenging sub-problem with very low success rates - yet it is central for the most biological processes.\n\nResultsWe developed an attention-based deep learning model inspired by algorithms used for image-caption assignments for sequence design of peptides or protein fragments. These interaction fragments are derived from and represent core parts of protein-protein interfaces. Our trained model allows the one-sided design of a given protein fragment which can be applicable for the redesign of protein-interfaces or the de novo design of new interactions fragments. Here we demonstrate its potential by recapitulating naturally occurring protein-protein interactions including antibody-antigen complexes. The designed interfaces capture essential native interactions with high prediction accuracy and have native-like binding affinities. It further does not need precise backbone location, making it an attractive tool for working with de novo design of protein-protein interactions.\n\nAvailabilityThe source code of the method is available at https://github.com/strauchlab/iNNterfaceDesign\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity exhibits a near perfect inverse correlation with the glycocalyx thickness of target cells regardless of the specific glycan structures present. NK cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) have an enhanced ability to breach the glycocalyx and kill target cells. Equipping the NK cell surface with a mucin-digesting enzyme also improves killing with a performance enhancement that rivals or exceeds CARs in some cases.

    "abstract": "The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri is an invasive insect 1 and a vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), a bacterium whose growth in Citrus species results in citrus greening disease 2,3. Methods to enrich and sequence CLas from D. citri often rely on biased genome amplification 4 and nevertheless contain significant quantities of host DNA 5,6. To overcome these hurdles, we developed a simple pre-treatment DNase and filtration (hereafter PDF) protocol to directly sequence CLas and the complete, primarily uncultivable, microbiome from D. citri adults. The PDF protocol yielded CLas abundances upwards of 60% and enabled detection of 156 genetic variants in these strains compared to progenitor strains in Florida, which included prophage encoding regions with key functions in CLas pathogenesis, putative antibiotic resistance loci, and a single secreted effector. These variants suggest laboratory propagation of CLas may result in different phenotypic trajectories among laboratories, and may confound CLas physiology or therapeutic design and evaluation if these differences remain undocumented. Finally, we obtained genetic signatures affiliated with Citrus nuclear and organellar genomes, entomopathogenic fungal mitochondria, and commensal bacteria from laboratory-reared and field-collected D. citri adults. Hence, the PDF protocol can inform agricultural management strategies related to pathogen evolution 7, insect microbiome surveillance 8, antibiotic resistance screening 9, and gut content analysis 10.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of mitochondria and regulates a plethora of cellular functions including mitochondrial energy production. There is little knowledge of how CL regulates uptake and membrane transport processes in mammalian cells. Endothelial cells of the blood brain barrier (BBB) play a vital role in uptake of metabolites into the brain and are enriched in mitochondria compared with peripheral endothelial cells. We examined how deficiency in BBB endothelial CL regulates the expression of selected drug and metabolite transporters and their function.\n\nMethodsCardiolipin synthase-1 (hCLS1) was knocked down in a human brain microvessel endothelial cell line, hBMEC/D3, by Lipofectamine(R) transfection with hCLS1 siRNA and CL levels, CL synthase activity and the mRNA expression of selected blood brain barrier drug and metabolite transporters examined. Mock transfected hBMEC/D3 cells served as controls. The incorporation of [14C]creatine and [14C]oleate into hBMEC/D3 cells was determined as a measure of solute metabolite transport and protein expression of the creatine transporter determined.\n\nResultsKnockdown of the CL biosynthetic enzyme hCLS1 in hBMEC/D3 reduced CL and CL synthase activity and the mRNA expression of creatine transporter-1, p-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein compared to controls. In contrast, mRNA expression of ATP binding cassette subfamily C members-1, -3, multidrug resistance-associated protein-4 variants 1, -2, and fatty acid transport protein-1 were unaltered. Although ATP production was unaltered by hCLS1 knockdown, incorporation of [14C]creatine into hBMEC/D3 cells was reduced compared to controls. The reduction in [14C]creatine incorporation was associated with a reduction in creatine transporter-1 protein expression. In contrast, incorporation of [14C]oleic acid into hBMEC/D3 cells and the mRNA expression of fatty acid transport protein-1 was unaltered by knockdown of hCLS1 compared to controls.\n\nConclusionKnockdown of hCLS1 in hBMEC/D3, with a corresponding reduction in CL, results in alteration in expression of specific solute membrane transporters.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies to deamidated gluten peptides are accurate diagnostic markers of celiac disease (CeD). However, antibody binding to all possible gluten epitopes has not previously been investigated. To map antibody reactivity in detail and to understand the connection between disease-relevant B-cell and T-cell epitopes, we took advantage of a high-density peptide array for assessment of serum antibody specificity in CeD across the wheat gluten proteome. We confirm the importance of peptide deamidation for antibody binding, and we show that the response is remarkably focused on the known epitope QPEQPFP (where E results from deamidation of Q). In addition, we describe a new epitope in native (non-deamidated) gluten, QQPEQII (where E is gene encoded), which was associated with both B-cell and T-cell reactivity. By generating monoclonal antibodies from peptide-binding gut plasma cells of CeD patients, we show that antibodies to this native gluten epitope are cross-reactive with the major deamidated epitope due to recognition of the shared PEQ motif. Hence, antibodies to native gluten appear to arise from cross-reactive B cells that are generated as a side effect of the immune response to deamidated gluten. Since cross-reactive B cells could present peptides to different gluten-specific T cells, we suspect that such B cells can play a role in epitope spreading by engaging T cells with multiple specificities.",

    "abstract": "Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore {beta}-lactam with improved hydrolytic stability toward {beta}-lactamases, including carbapenemases, achieved by combining structural moieties of two clinically efficient cephalosporins, ceftazidime and cefepime. Consequently, cefiderocol represents a treatment alternative for infections caused by multi-drug resistant Gram-negatives. Using directed evolution on a wide variety of different {beta}-lactamases, such as KPC-2 and CTX-M-15 (Ambler class A), NDM-1 (class B), CMY-2 (class C) and OXA-48 (class D), we studied the role of cefiderocol during {beta}-lactamase-mediated resistance development. First, we investigated how the expression of different {beta}-lactamases causes changes in cefiderocol susceptibility. In a low-copy number vector, we found that OXA-48 and KPC-2 conferred non or marginal decreases in cefiderocol susceptibility, respectively. On the contrary, CMY-2, CTX-M-15 and NDM-1 substantially decreased cefiderocol susceptibility by 16-, 8- and 32-fold, respectively. Second, we determined the evolutionary potential of these enzymes to adapt to increasing concentrations of cefiderocol. Our data show that with the acquisition of only 1 to 2 mutations, all {beta}-lactamases were evolvable to further cefiderocol resistance by 2- (NDM-1, CTX-M-15), 4- (CMY-2), 8- (OXA-48) and 16-fold (KPC-2). Cefiderocol resistance development was often associated with collateral susceptibility changes including increased resistance to ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam as well as functional trade-offs against different {beta}-lactam drugs. Taken together, contemporary {beta}-lactamases of all Ambler classes can potentially contribute to cefiderocol resistance development and can acquire mutations allowing them to adapt to increasing cefiderocol concentration. At the same time, resistance development caused clinically important cross-resistance, especially against ceftazidime combinations.\n\nSummaryDespite the reported higher stability of cefiderocol against {beta}-lactamase hydrolysis, we show that the expression of {beta}-lactamases from different Ambler classes significantly contributes to cefiderocol resistance and that these enzymes have the evolutionary potential to evolve towards increasing cefiderocol concentrations.",

    "abstract": "Human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) E2 is a DNA binding protein that regulates transcription, replication and potentially, segregation of the HPV16 genome during the viral life cycle. In the segregation model, E2 simultaneously binds to viral and host chromatin, acting as a bridge to ensure that viral genomes reside in daughter nuclei following cell division. The host chromatin receptor for E2 mediating this function is unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that CK2 phosphorylation of E2 on serine 23 (S23) is required for interaction with TopBP1, and that this interaction promotes E2 and TopBP1 recruitment to mitotic chromatin. Here, we demonstrate that in U2OS and N/Tert-1 cells expressing wild type E2 and a non-TopBP1 binding mutant (S23A, serine 23 mutated to alanine), interaction with TopBP1 is essential for E2 recruitment of plasmids to mitotic chromatin. Using a novel quantitative segregation assay, we demonstrate that interaction with TopBP1 is required for E2 plasmid segregation. The interaction of E2 with TopBP1 promotes increased levels of E2 protein during mitosis in U2OS and N/Tert-1 cells, as well as in human foreskin keratinocytes immortalized by the HPV16 genome. Additionally, interaction with TopBP1 is required for expression of the E2 protein during the viral life cycle. Overall, our results demonstrate that E2 has plasmid segregation activity, and that the E2-TopBP1 interaction is essential for this E2 function and for E2 expression during the viral life cycle.\n\nImportanceHPV16 causes 3-4% of all human cancers. During the viral life cycle, it is proposed that the viral genome is actively segregated into daughter nuclei, ensuring viral replication in the subsequent S phase. The E2 protein potentially bridges the viral and host genomes during mitosis to mediate segregation of the circular viral plasmid. Here, we demonstrate that E2 has the ability to mediate plasmid segregation, and that this function is dependent upon interaction with the host protein TopBP1. Additionally, we demonstrate that the E2-TopBP1 interaction promotes enhanced E2 expression during mitosis which likely promotes the plasmid segregation function of E2. Overall, our results present a mechanism of how HPV16 can segregate its viral genome during an active infection, a critical aspect of the viral life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthesis is a biophysical and biochemical process that plays a key role in sustaining plant and human life, being the first step in the production of energy-rich molecules and oxygen in the biosphere. Improving the photosynthetic capacity of agricultural crops is highly desirable to increase their yields. While the core mechanisms of photosynthesis are highly conserved, certainly in higher plants, plants that can maintain a high photosynthetic light-use efficiency at high irradiance are exceptional and may be useful to understand and improve high irradiance photosynthesis of crops. One such exceptional species is Hirschfeldia incana, a member of the well-studied Brassicaceae family that is easy to grow under standard laboratory conditions, providing an excellent resource for studying the genetic and physiological basis of this trait. Here, we present a reference assembly of H. incana and affirm its high photosynthetic efficiency relative to the Brassicaceae species Brassica rapa, Brassica nigra, and Arabidopsis thaliana. We estimate that it diverged from B. rapa and B. nigra 10-11 million years ago and that its genome has diversified from that of the latter two species through large chromosomal rearrangements, species-specific transposon activity, and differential retention of duplicated genes. Genes present at copy numbers different from B. rapa and B. nigra include those involved in photosynthesis and/or abiotic stress, which may mediate the high photosynthetic efficiency of H. incana. We expect the reference assembly of H. incana to be a valuable genomic resource for identifying ways to enhance photosynthetic rates in crop species.",

Predominantly, neural activity in these circuits are interpreted in the context of a rate code, where information is conveyed by changes in the number of spikes over a given time. However, such a description of neuronal activity is difficult to achieve in real-world, real-time scenarios.

    "abstract": "Molecular hydrogen (H2) and carbon monoxide (CO) are supersaturated in seawater relative to the atmosphere and hence are readily accessible energy sources for marine microbial communities. Yet while marine CO oxidation is well-described, it is unknown whether seawater communities consume H2. Here we integrated genome-resolved metagenomics, biogeochemistry, thermodynamic modelling, and culture-based analysis to profile H2 and CO oxidation by marine bacteria. Based on analysis of 14 surface water samples, collected from three locations spanning tropical to subantarctic fronts, three uptake hydrogenase classes are prevalent in seawater and encoded by major marine families such as Rhodobacteraceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Sphingomonadaceae. However, they are less abundant and widespread than carbon monoxide dehydrogenases. Consistently, microbial communities in surface waters slowly consumed H2 and rapidly consumed CO at environmentally relevant concentrations, with H2 oxidation most active in subantarctic waters. The cell-specific power from these processes exceed bacterial maintenance requirements and, for H2, can likely sustain growth of bacteria with low energy requirements. Concordantly, we show that the polar ultramicrobacterium Sphingopyxis alaskensis grows mixotrophically on H2 by expressing a group 2a [NiFe]-hydrogenase, providing the first demonstration of atmospheric H2 oxidation by a marine bacterium. Based on TARA Oceans metagenomes, genes for trace gas oxidation are globally distributed and are fourfold more abundant in deep compared to surface waters, highlighting that trace gases are important energy sources especially in energy-limited waters. Altogether, these findings show H2 is a significant energy source for marine communities and suggest that trace gases influence the ecology and biogeochemistry of oceans globally.",

Herein, we show an emergent property of bistability arising from feedback among the Wnt destruction complex proteins that target the key transcriptional co-activator {beta}-catenin for degradation. Using biochemical reconstitution, we identified positive feedback between the scaffold protein Axin and the kinase GSK3. Theoretical modeling of this feedback between Axin and GSK3 predicted that the activity of the destruction complex exhibits bistable behavior. We experimentally confirmed these predictions by demonstrating that cellular cytoplasmic {beta}-catenin concentrations exhibit an \"all-or-none\" response with sustained memory (hysteresis) of the signaling input. This bistable behavior was transformed into a graded response and memory was lost through inhibition of GSK3. These findings provide a mechanism for establishing decisive, switch-like cellular response and memory upon Wnt pathway stimulation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPositive feedback within the {beta}-catenin destruction complex gives rise to bistability and memory in response to Wnt stimulation, imparting signal transduction accuracy and insulation.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors read the genome, fundamentally connecting DNA sequence to gene expression across diverse cell types. Determining how, where, and when TFs bind chromatin will advance our understanding of gene regulatory networks and cellular behavior. The 2017 ENCODE-DREAM in vivo Transcription-Factor Binding Site (TFBS) Prediction Challenge highlighted the value of chromatin accessibility data to TFBS prediction, establishing state-of-the- art methods for TFBS prediction from DNase-seq. However, the more recent Assay-for- Transposase-Accessible-Chromatin (ATAC)-seq has surpassed DNase-seq as the most widely- used chromatin accessibility profiling method. Furthermore, ATAC-seq is the only such technique available at single-cell resolution from standard commercial platforms. While ATAC-seq datasets grow exponentially, suboptimal motif scanning is unfortunately the most common method for TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq. To enable community access to state-of-the-art TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq, we (1) curated an extensive benchmark dataset (127 TFs) for ATAC-seq model training and (2) built \"maxATAC\", a suite of user-friendly, deep neural network models for genome-wide TFBS prediction from ATAC-seq in any cell type. With models available for 127 human TFs, maxATAC is the first collection of high-performance TFBS prediction models for ATAC-seq. maxATAC performance extends to primary cells and single-cell ATAC-seq, enabling improved TFBS prediction in vivo. We demonstrate maxATACs capabilities by identifying TFBS associated with allele-dependent chromatin accessibility at atopic dermatitis genetic risk loci.\n\nAuthor SummaryProteins called transcription factors interpret the genome, reading both DNA sequence and chromatin state, to orchestrate gene expression across the diversity of human cell types. In any given cell type, most chromatin is \"inaccessible\", and only those parts of the genetic code needed or likely to be needed soon are \"accessible\" for transcription factor binding to affect gene expression and cellular behavior. Hundreds of transcription factors are expressed in a given cell type and context (e.g., age, disease), and knowledge of their context-specific DNA binding sites is key to uncovering how transcription factors regulate cellular behaviors in health or disease. However, experimentally profiling the >1,600 human transcription factors across all cell types and contexts is infeasible. We built a suite of computational models \"maxATAC\" to predict transcription factor binding from a measurement of accessible chromatin, ATAC-seq. Importantly, ATAC-seq is feasible even at single-cell resolution. Thus, this data type, in combination with maxATAC, can be used to infer transcription factor binding sites in directly-relevant cell types isolated from physiological and disease settings, enabling insights into disease mechanisms, including how genetic variants and cellular context impact transcription factor binding, gene expression patterns and disease risk.",

In this work, we studied elongation factor SPT5 and explored protein nucleic acid interactions for the isolated systems of KOW1 and KOW4 domains of SPT5 with DNA and RNA, respectively. We performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using three commonly used force fields that are CHARMM c36m, AMBER ff14sb and ff19sb. These simulations showed that most of the protein-nucleic acid interactions in the native state were retained with an increased electrostatic binding free energy for all force fields used. RNA was found highly dynamic with all force fields while DNA had relatively more stable conformations with the AMBER force fields compared to CHARMM. Furthermore, we performed MD simulations of the complete elongation complex using CHARMM c36m force field to compare the dynamics and interactions in the isolated systems. Similar strong KOW1 and DNA interactions were observed in the complete elongation complex simulations and DNA was further stabilized by a network of interactions involving SPT5-KOW1, SPT4 and rpb2 of Pol II. Overall, our study showed that the accuracy of force fields and the presence of the entire interaction network are important for elucidating the dynamics of protein-nucleic acid systems.",

    "abstract": "BK type Ca2+-activated K+ channels activate in response to both the membrane voltage and intracellular Ca2+ with distinct mechanisms. Ca2+ binds to the cytosolic domain (CTD) to open the pore across the membrane, but the mechanism that couples Ca2+ binding to pore opening is not clear. Here we show that a compound, BC5, identified using in silico screening, interacts with BK channels at the interface between the CTD and the transmembrane voltage sensing domain (VSD) and enhances channel activity by specifically affecting the Ca2+ dependent mechanism. BC5 activates the channel in the absence of Ca2+ binding but Ca2+ binding inhibits BC5 effects. Thus, BC5 perturbs the pathway that couples Ca2+ binding to pore opening to allosterically affect both, which is supported by atomistic simulations and mutagensis. The results suggest that the CTD- VSD interaction makes a major contribution to the mechanism of Ca2+ dependent activation and is an important site for allosteric agonists to modulate BK channel activation.",

    "abstract": "Short-lived or transient interactions of macromolecules at and with lipid membranes, an interface where a multitude of essential biological reactions take place, are inherently difficult to assess with standard biophysical methods. The introduction of mass-sensitive particle tracking (MSPT) constitutes an important step towards a thorough quantitative characterization of such processes. Technically, this was made possible through the advent of interferometric scattering microscopy (iSCAT)-based mass photometry (MP). When the background removal strategy is optimized to reveal the two-dimensional motion of membrane-associated particles, this technique allows the real-time analysis of both diffusion and molecular mass of unlabeled macromolecules on biological membranes. Here, a detailed protocol to perform and analyze mass-sensitive particle tracking of membrane-associated systems is described. Measurements performed on a commercial mass photometer achieve time resolution in the millisecond regime and, depending on the MP system, a mass detection limit down to 50 kDa. To showcase the potential of MSPT for the in-depth analysis of membrane-catalyzed macromolecule dynamics in general, results obtained for exemplary protein systems such as the native membrane interactor annexin V are presented.\n\nSUMMARYThis protocol describes an iSCAT-based image processing and single-particle tracking approach that enables the simultaneous investigation of the molecular mass and the diffusive behavior of macromolecules interacting with lipid membranes. Step-by-step instructions for sample preparation, mass-to-contrast conversion, movie acquisition, and post-processing are provided along-side directions to prevent potential pitfalls.",

    "abstract": "One century after the first report of Dutch Elm Disease (DED), there is still no practical solution for this problem threatening European and American elms (Ulmus spp.). The long breeding cycles needed to select resistant genotypes and the lack of efficient treatments keep disease incidence at high levels. In the present work, the expression of defense-related genes to the causal agent of DED, Ophiostoma novo-ulmi, were analyzed in in vitro clonal plantlets from two DED-resistant and two DED-susceptible U. minor trees. In addition, the effect of the inoculation of an endophytic pink-pigmented yeast (Cystobasidium sp.) on the plants defense system was tested both individually and in combination with O. novo-ulmi. The multifactorial nature of the resistance to DED was confirmed, as no common molecular response was found in the two resistant genotypes. However, the in vitro experimental system allowed to discriminate the susceptible from the resistant genotypes, showing higher levels of oxidative stress and phenolic compounds in the susceptible genotypes after pathogen inoculation. Inoculation of the endophyte before O. novo-ulmi attenuated the plant molecular response induced by the pathogen and moderated oxidative stress levels. Niche competition, endophyte-pathogen antagonism, and molecular crosstalk between the host and the endophyte are discussed as possible mechanisms of stress reduction. In sum, our results confirm the multifactorial nature of DED resistance mechanisms and highlight the possibility of using certain endophytic yeasts as biological tools to improve tree resilience against biotic stress.",

    "abstract": "Complex brain functions, including learning and memory, arise in part from the modulatory role of astrocytes on neuronal circuits. Functionally, the dentate gyrus (DG) exhibits differences in the acquisition of long-term potentiation (LTP) between day and night. We hypothesize that the dynamic nature of astrocyte morphology plays an important role in the functional circuitry of hippocampal learning and memory, specifically in the DG. Standard microscopy techniques, such as differential interference contrast (DIC), present insufficient contrast for detecting changes in astrocyte structure and function and are unable to inform on the intrinsic structure of the sample in a quantitative manner. Recently, gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) has been developed to upgrade a DIC microscope with quantitative capabilities such as single-cell dry mass and volume characterization. Here, we present a methodology for combining GLIM and electrophysiology to quantify the astrocyte morphological behavior over the day-night cycle. Colocalized measurements of GLIM and fluorescence allowed us to quantify the dry masses and volumes of hundreds of astrocytes. Our results indicate that, on average, there is a 25% cell volume reduction during the nocturnal cycle. Remarkably, this cell volume change takes place at constant dry mass, which suggests that the volume regulation occurs primarily through aqueous medium exchange with the environment.",

    "abstract": "The use of spatial maps to navigate through the world requires a complex ongoing transformation of egocentric views of the environment into position within the allocentric map. Recent research has discovered neurons in retrosplenial cortex and other structures that could mediate the transformation from egocentric views to allocentric views. These egocentric boundary cells respond to the egocentric direction and distance of barriers relative to an animals point of view. This egocentric coding based on the visual features of barriers would seem to require complex dynamics of cortical interactions. However, computational models presented here show that egocentric boundary cells can be generated with a remarkably simple synaptic learning rule that forms a sparse representation of visual input as an animal explores the environment. Simulation of this simple sparse synaptic modification generates a population of egocentric boundary cells with distributions of direction and distance coding that strikingly resemble those observed within the retrosplenial cortex. This provides a framework for understanding the properties of neuronal populations in the retrosplenial cortex that may be essential for interfacing egocentric sensory information with allocentric spatial maps of the world formed by neurons in downstream areas including the grid cells in entorhinal cortex and place cells in the hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Many species, including humans and non-human primates, react differently to threatening or pleasant situations. Because of its adaptiveness, recognizing affective signals is likely to be reflected in a capability of modern humans to recognize other closely related species call content. However, at both behavioural and neural levels, only few studies have used a comparative approach to understand affective decoding processes in humans, particularly with respect to affective vocalizations. Previous research in neuroscience about the recognition of human affective vocalizations has shown the critical involvement of temporal and frontal regions. In particular, frontal regions have been reported as crucial in the explicit decoding of vocal emotions especially in different task complexity such as discrimination or categorization. The aim of this study using functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) was to specifically investigate the neural activity of the inferior frontal cortex pars triangularis (IFGtri) and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underlying categorization (A versus B) and discrimination (A versus non-A) mechanisms of positive and negative affects in human, great apes (chimpanzee and bonobo), and monkey (rhesus macaque) vocalizations. We also analysed participants behavioural responses and correlated them with the recorded frontal activations. While performing the tasks, fNIRS data revealed a clear distinction between the two frontal regions, with a general positive activation of IFGtri compared to a decrease of PFC activity. We also found a modulation of IFGtri and PFC activations depending on both the species considered and on task complexity; with generally more activity in the IFGtri during discrimination compared to categorization, and a more intense decrease of the PFC in categorization compared to discrimination. Behaviourally, participants recognized almost all affective cues in all species vocalizations at above chance levels in the discrimination task (except for threatening bonobo calls). For categorization, they mostly correctly identified at levels significantly above chance affective contents in human and great ape vocalizations but not in macaque calls. Overall, these findings support the hypothesis of a pre-human origin of affective recognition processing inherited from our common ancestor with other great apes and processed in the frontal cortex. Our results also highlight behavioural differences related to task complexity, i.e. between categorization and discrimination processes, and the differential involvement of the PFC and the IFGtri, which seems necessary to explicitly decode affects in all primate vocalizations.",

To this end, a number of clinical trials are investigating the potential of existing drugs to enhance oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, the process that fails in chronic MS lesions. As we previously reported that oligodendroglia lineage cells express GABAB receptors (GABABRs) both in vitro and in vivo, and that GABABR-mediated signaling enhances OPC differentiation and myelination in vitro, here we focused on the remyelinating potential of the best-known GABABR agonist baclofen (Bac), already approved to treat spasticity in MS. We demonstrated that Bac increases myelin protein production following lysolecithin (LPC)-induced demyelination in cerebellar ex vivo slices. In addition, Bac administration enhanced OPC differentiation and remyelination in LPC-induced spinal cord lesions in adult mice. Thus, our results suggest that Bac should be considered as a potential therapeutic agent, not only to treat spasticity, but also to improve remyelination in patients with MS.",

Therefore, there is an urgent unmet need for identifying cell populations capable of cardiac regeneration that we will be able to trace and monitor. Injury to the adult mammalian cardiac muscle, often leads to a heart attack through the irreversible loss of a large number of cardiomyocytes, due to an idle regenerative capability. Recent reports in zebrafish indicate that Tbx5a is a vital transcription factor for cardiomyocyte regeneration. Preclinical data underscore the cardioprotective role of Tbx5 upon heart failure. Data from our earlier murine developmental studies have pinpointed a prominent unipotent Tbx5-expressing embryonic cardiac precursor cell population able to form cardiomyocytes, in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo.\n\nUsing a developmental approach to an adult heart injury model and by employing a lineage-tracing mouse model as well as the use of single-cell RNA-seq technology, we identify a Tbx5-expressing ventricular cardiomyocyte-like precursor population, in the injured adult mammalian heart. The transcriptional profile of that precursor cell population is closer to that of neonatal than embryonic cardiomyocyte precursors. Tbx5, a cardinal cardiac development transcription factor, lies in the centre of a ventricular adult precursor cell population, which seems to be affected by neurohormonal spatiotemporal cues.\n\nThe identification of a Tbx5-specific cardiomyocyte precursor-like cell population, which is capable of dedifferentiating and potentially deploying a cardiomyocyte regenerative program, provides a clear target cell population for translationally-relevant heart interventional studies.",

A massive wildfire occurred in this ecosystem in August 2021. Here, this study aims to detect the burnt areas and assess the ecosystem covariates related to the wildfire occurrences. Wildfire assessments were conducted using remote sensing (RS) analysis. Measured ecosystem covariates include vegetation cover, moisture, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The RS analysis confirms at least 17090 ha of vegetation cover were damaged. The burnt vegetation cover was associated with the vegetation moisture and NDVI. The result shows 61.93% of burnt areas were observed within areas that had low vegetation moisture. While 51.75% of burnt areas occurred within areas that had low NDVI values. Naive Bayes classifier confirms that vegetation moisture and NDVI covariates can be used to estimate the presences of wildfires with values of Kappa, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are 0.7, 0.85, 0.89, 0.8, and 0.84. The area under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve values for vegetation moisture and NDVI covariates were 0.945 and 0.399. This value indicates that low vegetation moisture contributes more to the wildfire presences than low NDVI.",

Attention has focussed chiefly on how sociality and sensory systems have evolved together. In the Hymenoptera, the antennal sensilla are important for optimising the perception of olfactory social information. Social species have denser antennal sensilla than solitary species, which is thought to enhance social cohesion through nest-mate recognition. In the current study, we test whether sensilla numbers vary between populations of the socially plastic sweat bee Halictus rubicundus from regions that vary in climate and the degree to which sociality is expressed. We found region level differences in both olfactory and hygro/thermoreceptive sensilla numbers. We also found evidence that olfactory sensilla density is developmentally plastic: when we transplanted bees from Scotland to the south-east of England, their offspring (which developed in the south) had more olfactory hairs than the transplanted individuals themselves (which developed in Scotland). The transplanted bees displayed a mix of social (a queen plus workers) and solitary nesting, but neither individual nor nest phenotype was related to sensilla density. We suggest that this general, rather than caste-specific sensory plasticity provides a flexible means to optimise sensory perception according to the most pressing demands of the environment. Sensory plasticity may support social plasticity in H. rubicundus but does not appear to be causally related to it.",

    "abstract": "GPS-based tracking is widely used for studying wild social animals. Much like traditional observational methods, using GPS devices requires making a number of decisions about sampling that can affect the robustness of a studys conclusions. For example, sampling fewer individuals per group across more distinct social groups may not be sufficient to infer group- or subgroup-level behaviours, while sampling more individuals per group across fewer groups limits the ability to draw conclusions about populations. Here, we provide quantitative recommendations when designing GPS-based tracking studies of animal societies. We focus on the trade-offs between three fundamental axes of sampling effort: 1) sampling coverage--the number and allocation of GPS devices among individuals in one or more social groups; 2) sampling duration--the total amount of time over which devices collect data; 3) sampling frequency--the temporal resolution at which GPS devices record data. We first test GPS tags under field conditions to quantify how these aspects of sampling design can affect both GPS accuracy (error in absolute positional estimates) and GPS precision (error in the estimate relative position of two individuals), demonstrating that GPS error can have profound effects when inferring distances between individuals. We then use data from whole-group tracked vulturine guineafowl (Acryllium vulturinum) to demonstrate how the trade-off between sampling frequency and sampling duration can impact inferences of social interactions and to quantify how sampling coverage can affect common measures of social behaviour in animal groups, identifying which types of measures are more or less robust to lower coverage of individuals. Finally, we use data-informed simulations to extend insights across groups of different sizes and cohesiveness. Based on our results, we are able to offer a range of recommendations on GPS sampling strategies to address research questions across social organizational scales and social systems--from group movement to social network structure and collective decision-making.

    "abstract": "Owing to the unique combination of electrical conductivity and tissue-like mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have emerged as a promising candidate for bioelectronic interfacing with biological systems. However, despite the recent advances, the development of hydrogels with both excellent electrical and mechanical properties in physiological environments remains a lingering challenge. Here, we report a bi-continuous conducting polymer hydrogel (BC-CPH) that simultaneously achieves high electrical conductivity (over 11 S cm-1), stretchability (over 400%) and fracture toughness (over 3,300 J m-2) in physiological environments, and is readily applicable to advanced fabrication methods including 3D printing. Enabled by the BC-CPH, we further demonstrate multi-material 3D printing of monolithic all-hydrogel bioelectronic interfaces for long-term electrophysiological recording and stimulation of various organs. This study may offer promising materials and a platform for future bioelectronic interfacing.",

Improving outcomes for recurrent cancers requires a better understanding of cancer cell populations that expand from the post-therapy, minimal residual disease (MRD) state. We profiled barcoded tumor stem cell populations through therapy at tumor initiation/engraftment, MRD and recurrence in our therapy-adapted, patient-derived xenograft models of glioblastoma (GBM). Tumors showed distinct patterns of recurrence in which clonal populations exhibited either an a priori, pre-existing fitness advantage, or a priori equipotency fitness acquired through therapy. Characterization of the MRD state by single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing revealed a tumor-intrinsic immunomodulatory signature with strong prognostic significance at the transcriptomic level and in proteomic analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collected from GBM patients at all stages of disease. Our results provide insight into the innate and therapy-driven dynamics of human GBM, and the prognostic value of interrogating the MRD state in solid cancers.",

    "abstract": "Diets regulate animal development, reproduction, and lifespan. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive. A chemically defined CeMM diet attenuates development and promotes longevity of C. elegans, but whether it impact on other nematodes is unknown. Here, we studied the effect of the CeMM diet on the development and longevity of the marine nematode Litoditis marina, which belongs to the same family as C. elegans. We further investigated genome-wide transcriptional responses to CeMM and OP50 diet for both nematodes, respectively. We observed that the CeMM diet attenuated L. marina development but did not extend its lifespan. We found that many of the FOXO DAF-16 target genes, lysosome and xenobiotic metabolism related genes were significantly increased on the CeMM, which might contribute to the lifespan extension of C. elegans. Notably, we found that the expression of lysosome and xenobiotic metabolism pathway genes was significantly down regulated in L. marina on CeMM, which might explain why the CeMM diet could not promote the lifespan of L. marina compared to bacterial feeding. Additionally, down-regulation of several RNA transcription and protein generation and related processes genes might not only be involved in extending longevity but also contribute to attenuating development of C. elegans on CeMM, while down-regulation of unsaturated fatty acids synthesis genes might contribute to slow down the growth of L. marina on CeMM. Further genetic analysis of candidate gene(s) of longevity and development in C. elegans and L. marina will provide the molecular mechanisms underlying how diets regulate animal physiology and health in the context of global climate change with variable nutritional environments.",

    "abstract": "Optical (fluorescence) imaging of ionic dynamics has revolutionized neuroscience as it allows the study of neural activity across spatially identified populations. Quantification of fluorescence signals is commonly performed using ratiometric measures, like the {Delta}F/F. Although these measures are robust and easy to implement, they do not take advantage of the temporal information available in time-varying signals. Moreover, since a baseline (reference) period needs to be selected, their application is often limited to the quantification of stimulus-evoked activity. Here, we present a new approach, called ARES, based on the quantification of residuals after linear autoregression. We demonstrate the utility of ARES to quantify the functional dynamics of stimulus representation in cortical networks and show that it improves the spatial and temporal resolution with respect to {Delta}F/F. We further show that ARES can be used to study subcellular calcium dynamics and exemplify its utility to describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium signal localization in compartmental network recordings. ARES offers a novel method for quantitative analysis of optical imaging data\n\nAuthor summaryTwo-photon calcium imaging is a powerful and non-invasive method to measure and visualize the activity of neural populations in single cell and subcellular resolution. However, the slow dynamics of both the calcium signal itself and its indicators make it difficult to relate the timing and origin of the neural activity to the calcium signal. The most commonly used analysis method, {Delta}F/F, uses a reference baseline to quantify signal ratiometrically. This results in several limitations, especially in accounting for the time varying fluctuations in fluorescence values. Here we present a new method for the analysis of calcium signals, called ARES, in which a sliding window is used to predict the future values of the signal and deviations from this prediction are recorded as the signal. This has the advantage that shifts in baseline do not affect the processing, and that the method has an improved spatial and temporal resolution with respect to {Delta}F/F.",

    "abstract": "Externalizing behaviours in childhood often predict impulse control disorders in adulthood; however, the underlying biobehavioural risk factors are incompletely understood. In animals, the propensity to signtrack, or the degree to which incentive motivational value is attributed to reward cues, is associated with externalizing-type behaviours and deficits in executive control. Using a Pavlovian conditioned approach paradigm, we quantified sign-tracking in healthy 9-12-year-olds. We also measured parent-reported externalizing behaviours and anticipatory neural activations to outcome-predicting cues using the monetary incentive delay fMRI task. Sign-tracking was associated with attentional and inhibitory control deficits and the degree of amygdala, but not cortical, activation during reward anticipation. These findings support the hypothesis that youth with a propensity to sign-track are prone to externalizing tendencies, with an over-reliance on subcortical cue-reactive brain systems. This research highlights sign-tracking as a promising experimental approach delineating the behavioural and neural circuitry of individuals at risk for externalizing disorders.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is the major filamentous fungal pathogen in humans. The gold standard treatment of A. fumigatus is based on azole drug use but the appearance of azole-resistant isolates is increasing at an alarming rate. The cyp51A gene encodes the enzymatic target of azole drugs and azole-resistant alleles of cyp51A often have an unusual genetic structure containing a duplication of a 34 or 46 bp region in the promoter causing enhanced gene transcription. These tandem repeats are called TR34/TR46 and produce duplicated binding sites for the SrbA and AtrR transcription factors. Using site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that both the SrbA (sterol response element: SRE) and AtrR binding sites (AtrR response element: ATRE) are required for normal cyp51A gene expression. Loss of either the SRE or ATRE from the distal 34 bp repeat of the TR34 promoter (further 5 from the transcription start site) caused loss of expression of cyp51A and decreased voriconazole resistance. Surprisingly, loss of these same binding sites from the proximal 34 or 46 bp repeat led to increased cyp51A expression and voriconazole resistance. These data indicate that these duplicated regions in the cyp51A promoter function differently. Our findings suggest that the proximal 34 or 46 bp repeat in cyp51A recruits a corepressor that requires multiple factors to act while the distal repeat is free of this repression and provides the elevated cyp51A expression caused by these promoter duplications.\n\nImportanceAspergillus fumigatus is the most common human filamentous fungal pathogen. Azole drugs are the current therapy of choice for A. fumigatus but the prevalence of azole resistance is increasing. The main genetic alteration causing azole resistance is a change in the cyp51A gene that encodes the target of these drugs. Azole-resistant cyp51A alleles routinely contain duplications in their promoter regions that cause increased gene transcription. Here, we demonstrate that clinical isolates containing a 34 or 46 bp duplication in the cyp51A promoter required the presence of the transcription factor-encoding atrR gene to exhibit elevated azole resistance. Elimination of transcription factor binding sites in the cyp51A gene have differential actions on expression of the resulting mutant allele. These data dissect the molecular inputs to cyp51A transcription and reveal a complicated function of the promoter of this gene that is critical in azole resistance.",

In glioblastoma (GBM), ecDNA copy number correlates with poor prognosis. It is hypothesized that their copy number, size and chromatin accessibility facilitate clustering of ecDNA and colocalization with transcriptional condensates, and that this underpins their elevated transcriptional activity. Here, we use super-resolution imaging and quantitative image analysis to evaluate GBM stem cells harboring distinct ecDNA species (EGFR, MYC, PDGFR). We found no evidence that ecDNA cluster with one another or closely interact with transcriptional condensates. Cells with EGFR-containing ecDNA have increased EGFR transcriptional output, but transcription per gene copy was similar in ecDNA compared to the endogenous chromosomal locus. These data suggest that is the increased copy number of oncogene-harbouring ecDNA that primarily drives high levels of oncogene transcription, rather than specific interactions of ecDNA with the cellular transcriptional machinery.",

    "abstract": "Mesangial cells (MCs) in the kidney are central to maintaining glomerular integrity, and their impairment leads to major glomerular diseases including diabetic nephropathy (DN). Although high blood glucose elicits abnormal alterations in MCs, the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here, we show that YAP and TAZ, the final effectors of the Hippo pathway, are highly increased in MCs of patients with DN and of Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Moreover, high glucose directly induces activation of YAP/TAZ through the canonical Hippo pathway in cultured MCs. Hyperactivation of YAP/TAZ in mouse model MCs recapitulates the hallmarks of DN, including excessive proliferation of MCs and extracellular matrix deposition, endothelial cell impairment, glomerular sclerosis, albuminuria, and reduced glomerular filtration rate. Mechanistically, activated YAP/TAZ bind and stabilize N-Myc protein, one of the Myc family of oncogenes. N-Myc stabilization leads to aberrant enhancement of its transcriptional activity and eventually to MC impairments and DN pathogenesis. Together, these findings shed light on how high blood glucose in diabetes mellitus leads to DN and support a rationale that lowering blood glucose in diabetes mellitus could delay DN pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The nucleoside analog remdesivir (RDV) is an FDA-approved antiviral for the treatment of SARS- CoV-2 infections, and as such it is critical to understand potential genetic determinants and barriers to RDV resistance. In this study, SARS-CoV-2 was subjected to 13 passages in cell culture with increasing concentrations of GS-441524, the parent nucleoside of RDV. At passage 13 the RDV resistance of the lineages ranged from 2.7-to 10.4-fold increase in EC50. Sequence analysis of the three lineage populations identified non-synonymous mutations in the nonstructural protein 12 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12-RdRp): V166A, N198S, S759A, V792I and C799F/R. Two of the three lineages encoded the S759A substitution at the RdRp Ser759-Asp-Asp active motif. In one lineage, the V792I substitution emerged first then combined with S759A. Introduction of the S759A and V792I substitutions at homologous nsp12 positions in viable isogenic clones of the betacoronavirus murine hepatitis virus (MHV) demonstrated their transferability across CoVs, up to 38-fold RDV resistance in combination, and a significant replication defect associated with their introduction. Biochemical analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp encoding S759A demonstrated a [~]10- fold decreased preference for RDV-triphosphate (RDV-TP) as a substrate, while nsp12-V792I diminished the UTP concentration needed to overcome the template-dependent inhibition associated with RDV. The in vitro selected substitutions here identified were rare or not detected in the >6 million publicly available nsp12-RdRp consensus sequences in the absence of RDV selection. The results define genetic and biochemical pathways to RDV resistance and emphasize the need for additional studies to define the potential for emergence of these or other RDV resistance mutations in various clinical settings.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySARS-CoV-2 develops in vitro resistance to remdesivir by distinct and complementary mutations and mechanisms in the viral polymerase",

Meningeal immunity conditions the immune reflection and immune defense in the meningeal area involving meningeal lymphatic organization, glymphatic structure, immune cells, and cytokines. The development of meningeal immunity dysfunction might be the leading cause for many neural diseases including ASD. The inbred mouse strain BTBRT+Itpr3tf/J (BTBR) shows multiple ASD-like behavioral phenotypes, thus making this strain a widely used animal model for ASD. In our previous study, we reported an altered peripheral immune profile in BTBR mice. Herein, we are investigating immunological and neural interactions associated with the aberrant behavior of BTBR mice. BTBR mice have an increased level of immune cell deposition in the meninges along with a higher level of CD4+ T cells expressing CD25 and of B and myeloid cells expressing more MHCII than C57BL/6 (B6) mice, which have normal behaviors. BTBR mice also have higher levels of autoantibodies to dsDNA, Aquaporin-4, NMDAR1, Pentraxin/SAP and Caspr2 than B6 mice, which may affect neural functions.

    "abstract": "Massive bleeding is a leading cause of deaths in trauma, surgeries, wartime injuries, and childbirth. In these situations of ongoing blood loss, it is critical for patients to be rapidly resuscitated. Currently, patients who require major transfusions are given cold and concentrated blood from the blood bank. This blood does not flow fast due to its viscosity. Equipment for rapid resuscitation such as rapid transfusers are very costly and are not accessible everywhere. Additionally, specialized training is required to operate these machines. Therefore, it is necessary to determine simple, quick, and effective ways to increase the flow rate of blood. The flow rate can be increased by warming and hemodilution. The purpose of this study was to quantify the effects of these simple and quick methods since they can be implemented anywhere with easily accessible equipment. In this experiment, expired packed red blood cells were warmed and diluted. The time the blood took to flow through the tubing was measured and a flow rate was calculated for each trial. The research hypothesis stated that diluted blood at 39{degrees}C would have the fastest flow rate. The research hypothesis was supported and there was a 366% in flow rate by warming and diluting blood. There was a 232% increase by simply diluting the blood and a 170% increase by warming. Six t-tests were conducted for this data and they were all significant at a level of 0.001. These results indicate the significant effects of warming and diluting blood and this research could improve patient care during emergencies and massive blood loss.",
