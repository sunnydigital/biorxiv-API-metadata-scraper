    "abstract": "Timing is essential for survival and reproduction of organisms across the tree of life. The core circadian clock gene Clk has been implicated in annual timing and shows highly conserved sequence homology across vertebrates except for one variable region of poly Glutamine repeats. Clk genotype varies in some species with latitude, seasonal timing and migration. However, findings are inconsistent, difficult to disentangle from environmental responses, and biased towards high latitudes. Here we combine field data with a common-garden set up to study associations of Clk with latitude, migration and annual-cycle timing within the stonechat species complex with trans-equatorial distribution range. Including 950 individuals from nine populations with diverse migratory strategies. Gene diversity was lowest in resident African and Canary Island populations and increased with latitude, independently of migration distance. Repeat length and annual-cycle timing was linked in a population-specific way. Specifically, equatorial African stonechats showed delayed timing with longer repeat length for all annual-cycle stages. Our data suggest that at low latitudes with constant photoperiod, Clk genotype might orchestrate a range of consistent, individual chronotypes. In contrast, the influence of Clk on annual-cycle timing at higher latitudes might be mediated by its interactions with genes involved in (circadian) photoperiodic pathways.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe corn leafhopper Dalbulus maidis is the main vector of three important stunting pathogens that affect maize production. The most common control strategy against this species is the use of insecticides that provide minimal, short-term protection. In this context, genomic-based technologies such as RNA interference (RNAi) could be a suitable approach to control this pest in a highly specific manner, avoiding the adverse effects associated with insecticide misuse. Therefore, the objective of the present work was to assess the application of RNAi on D. maidis through different dsRNA delivery methods and known the function of target gene, Bicaudal C (BicC).\n\nRESULTSWe have identified and characterized the core components of the RNAi machinery in silico and established two methods of exogenous double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) delivery to D. maidis. BicC -an important regulator of insect oogenesis-dsRNA was successfully delivered via injection or ingestion to adult females, causing significant reductions in the transcript levels and ovipositions and observable phenotypes in the ovaries when compared to control females. The small doses of dsRNABicC administered were enough to trigger a strong RNAi response, demonstrating that D. maidis is highly sensitive to RNAi.\n\nCONCLUSIONThis is, to our knowledge, the first report describing RNAi application in D. maidis, a tool that can be used to advance towards a novel, insecticide-free control strategy against this pest.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe false clownfish Amphiprion ocellaris is a popular fish species and an emerging model organism for studying the ecology, evolution, adaptation, and developmental biology of reef fishes. Despite this, high-quality genomic resources for this species are scarce, hindering advanced genomic analyses. Leveraging the power of PacBio long-read sequencing and Hi-C chromosome conformation capture techniques, we constructed a high-quality chromosome-scale genome assembly for the clownfish A. ocellaris.\n\nResultsThe initial genome assembly comprised of 1,551 contigs of 861.42 Mb, with an N50 of 863.85 kb. Hi-C scaffolding of the genome resulted in 24 chromosomes containing 856.61 Mb. The genome was annotated with 26,797 protein-coding genes and had 96.62 % completeness of conserved actinopterygian genes, making this genome the most complete and high quality among published anemonefish genomes. Transcriptomic analysis identified tissue-specific gene expression patterns, with the brain and optic lobe having the largest number of expressed genes. Further, comparative genomic analysis revealed 91 genome elements conserved only in A. ocellaris and its sister species Amphiprion percula, and not in other anemonefish species. These elements are close to genes that are involved in various nervous system functions and exhibited distinct expression patterns in brain tissue, potentially highlighting the genetic toolkits involved in lineage-specific divergence and behaviors of the clownfish branch.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our study provides the highest quality A. ocellaris genome assembly and annotation to date, whilst also providing a valuable resource for understanding the ecology and evolution of reef fishes.",

We demonstrated that ISSAAC-seq is sensitive and provides high quality data with orders of magnitude more features than existing methods. Using the joint profiles from over 10,000 nuclei from the mouse cerebral cortex, we uncovered major and rare cell types and cell-type specific regulatory elements and identified heterogeneity at the chromatin level within established cell types defined by gene expression. Finally, we revealed distinct dynamics and relationships of gene expression and chromatin accessibility during an oligodendrocyte maturation trajectory.",

    "abstract": "Copy-number aberrations (CNAs) are genetic alterations that amplify or delete the number of copies of large genomic segments. Although they are ubiquitous in cancer and, thus, a critical area of current cancer research, CNA identification from DNA sequencing data is challenging because it requires partitioning of the genome into complex segments with the same copy-number states that may not be contiguous. Existing segmentation algorithms address these challenges either by leveraging the local information among neighboring genomic regions, or by globally grouping genomic regions that are affected by similar CNAs across the entire genome. However, both approaches have limitations: overclustering in the case of local segmentation, or the omission of clusters corresponding to focal CNAs in the case of global segmentation. Importantly, inaccurate segmentation will lead to inaccurate identification of important CNAs. For this reason, most pan-cancer research studies rely on manual procedures of quality control and anomaly correction. To improve copy-number segmentation and their control, we introduce CNAVO_SCPLOWIZC_SCPLOW, a web-based tool that enables the user to simultaneously perform local and global segmentation, thus overcoming the limitations of each approach. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that by several metrics, CNAVO_SCPLOWIZC_SCPLOW allows the user to obtain more accurate segmentation relative to existing local and global segmentation methods. Moreover, we analyze six bulk DNA sequencing samples from three breast cancer patients. By validating with parallel singlecell DNA sequencing data from the same samples, we show that by using CNAVO_SCPLOWIZC_SCPLOW, our user was able to obtain more accurate segmentation and improved accuracy in downstream copy-number calling. CNAVO_SCPLOWIZC_SCPLOW is available at https://github.com/elkebir-group/cnaviz.",

    "abstract": "The global banana industry is threatened by one of the most devastating diseases: Fusarium wilt (FWB). FWB is caused by the soil-borne fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), which almost annihilated the banana production in the late 1950s. A new strain of Foc, known as tropical race 4 (TR4), attacks a wide range of banana varieties including Cavendish clones which are the source of 99% of banana exports. In 2019, Foc TR4 was reported in Colombia, and more recently (2021) in Peru. In this study, we sequenced three fungal isolates identified as Foc TR4 from La Guajira (Colombia) and compared them against 19 whole-genome sequences of Foc TR4 publicly available, including four genome sequences recently released from Peru. To understand the genetic relatedness of the Colombian Foc TR4 isolates and those from Peru, we conducted a phylogenetic analysis based on a genome-wide set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Additionally, we compared the genomes of the 22 available Foc TR4 isolates looking for the presence-absence of gene polymorphisms and genomic regions. Our results reveal that (i) the Colombian and Peruvian isolates are genetically distant, which could be better explained by independent incursions of the pathogen to the continent, and (ii) there is a high correspondence between the genetic relatedness and geographic origin of Foc TR4. The profile of present/absent genes and the distribution of missing genomic regions showed a high correspondence to the clades recovered in the phylogenetic analysis, supporting the results obtained by SNP-based phylogeny.",

The relationship between lifespan and health, and the influence of genetic background on that relationship, has important implications in the development of anti-aging interventions. Here we combined survival under thermal and oxidative stress with swimming performance, to evaluate health effects across a nematode genetic diversity panel for three compounds previously studied in the Caenorhabditis Intervention Testing Program - NP1, propyl gallate, and resveratrol. We show that oxidative stress resistance and thermotolerance vary with compound intervention, genetic background, and age. The effects of tested compounds on swimming locomotion, in contrast, are largely species-specific. Additionally, thermotolerance, but not oxidative stress or swimming ability, correlates with lifespan. Our results demonstrate the importance of assessing health and lifespan across genetic backgrounds in the effort to identify reproducible aging interventions.",

Recent studies indicate that NRP1, an important receptor of the natural peptide tuftsin, facilitates SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, tuftsin is a natural human molecule released from IgG. Here, we found 91 overlapping genes between tuftsin targets and COVID-19-associated genes. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that tuftsin could also target ACE2 and exert some immune-related functions to treat COVID-19. Using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis, we confirmed that tuftsin can bind ACE2 and NRP1 directly. Moreover, tuftsin effectively impairs the binding of SARS-CoV-2 S1 to ACE2. Thus, tuftsin is an attractive drug against COVID-19. And tuftsin as natural immunostimulating peptide in human, we speculate that tuftsin may has crucial roles in asymptomatic carriers or mild cases of COVID-19.",

Motility is frequently characterized by qualitative analysis of macroscopic colonies, yet the standard quantification method has mainly been limited to manual measurement. Recent studies have applied deep learning for classification and segmentation of specific microbial species in microscopic images, but less work has focused on macroscopic colony analysis. Here, we advance computational tools for analyzing colonies of Proteus mirabilis, a bacterium that produces a macroscopic bullseye-like pattern via periodic swarming, a process implicated in its virulence. We present a dual-task pipeline for segmenting (1) the macroscopic colony including faint outer swarm rings, and (2) internal ring boundaries, unique features of oscillatory swarming. Our convolutional neural network for patch-based colony segmentation and U-Net with a VGG-11 encoder for ring boundary segmentation achieved test Dice scores of 93.28% and 83.24%, respectively. The predicted masks at times improved on the ground truths from our automated annotation algorithms. We demonstrate how application of our pipeline to a typical swarming assay enables ease of colony analysis and precise measurements of more complex pattern features than those which have been historically quantified.",

    "abstract": "Simple feature detectors in the visual system, such as edge-detectors, are likely to underlie even the most complex visual processing, so understanding the limits of these systems is crucial for a fuller understanding of visual processing. We investigated the ability of bumblebees (Bombus terrestris) to discriminate between differently angled edges. In a multiple-choice, \"meadow-like\" scenario, bumblebees successfully discriminated between angled bars with 7{degrees} differences, significantly exceeding the previously reported performance of eastern honeybees (Apis cerana, limit: 15{degrees}). Neither the number of choices required to learn, nor the bees final discrimination performance were affected by the angular orientation of the training bars, indicating a uniform performance across the visual field. Previous work has found that, in dual-choice tests, eastern honeybees cannot reliably discriminate between angles with less than 25{degrees} difference, suggesting that performance in discrimination tasks is affected by the training regime, and doesnt simply reflect the perceptual limitations of the visual system. We used high resolution LCD monitors to investigate the limits of bumblebees angular resolution in dual-choice experiments. Bumblebee could still discriminate 7{degrees} angle differences under such conditions (exceeding the previously reported limit for Apis mellifera, of 10{degrees}, as well as that of A. cerana), eventually reaching similar levels of accuracy, but required longer learning periods than under multiple-choice conditions. Bumblebees show impressive abilities to discriminate between angled edges, performing better than two previously tested species of honeybee. This high performance may, in turn, support complex visual processing in the bumblebee brain.",

    "abstract": "The HTLV-1 protease is one of the major antiviral targets to overwhelm this virus. Several research groups have been developing protease inhibitors over the years, but none has been successful. In this regard, the development of new HTLV-1 protease inhibitors based on fixing the defects of previous inhibitors will overcome the absence of curative treatment for this oncovirus. Thus, we decided to study the unbinding pathways of the most potent (compound 10, Ki = 15 nM) and one of the weakest (compound 9, Ki = 7900 nM) protease inhibitors, which are very structurally similar, with the PDB IDs: 4YDG, 4YDF, using the Supervised Molecular Dynamics (SuMD) method. In this project, we had various short and long-time-scale simulations, that in total, we could have 12 successful unbindings (a total of 14.8 s) for the two compounds in both mp forms. This comparative study measured all the essential factors simultaneously in two different inhibitors, which improved our results. This study revealed that Asp32 or Asp32' in the two forms of mp state similarly exert super power effects on maintaining both potent and weak inhibitors in the binding pocket of HTLV-1 protease. In parallel with the important impact of these two residues, in the potent inhibitors unbinding process, His66' was a great supporter, that was absent in the weak inhibitors unbinding pathway. In contrast, in the weak inhibitors unbinding process, Trp98/Trp98' by pi-pi stacking interactions were unfavorable for the stability of the inhibitor in the binding site. In our opinion, these results will assist in designing more potent and effective inhibitors for the HTLV-1 protease.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus agalactiae (a group B streptococcus; GBS) is an important human pathogen causing pneumonia, sepsis and meningitis in neonates, as well as infections in pregnant women, immunocompromised individuals, and the elderly. For the future control of GBS-inflicted disease, GBS surface exposed proteins are particularly relevant as they may act as antigens for vaccine development and/or as serosubtype markers in epidemiological settings. Even so, the genes encoding some of the surface proteins established as serosubtype markers by antibody-based methods are still unknown. Here, we identify sar5 as the gene encoding the R3 surface protein, a serosubtype marker of hitherto unknown genetic origin.",
