    "abstract": "All caspases evolved from a common ancestor and subsequently developed into two general classes, inflammatory or apoptotic caspases. The caspase-hemoglobinase fold has been conserved throughout nearly one billion years of evolution and is utilized for both the monomeric and dimeric subfamilies of apoptotic caspases, called initiator and effector caspases, respectively. We compared the folding and assembly of procaspase-3b from zebrafish to that of human effector procaspases in order to examine the conservation of the folding landscape. Urea-induced equilibrium folding/unfolding of procaspase-3b showed a minimum three-state folding pathway, where the native dimer isomerizes to a partially folded dimeric intermediate, which then unfolds. A partially folded monomeric intermediate observed in the folding landscape of human procaspase-3 is not well-populated in zebrafish procaspase-3b. By comparing effector caspases from different species, we show that the effector procaspase dimer undergoes a pH-dependent conformational change, and that the conformational species in the folding landscape exhibit similar free energies. Together, the data show that the landscape for the caspase-hemoglobinase fold is conserved, yet it provides flexibility for species-specific stabilization or destabilization of folding intermediates resulting in changes in stability. The common pH-dependent conformational change in the native dimer, which yields an enzymatically inactive species, may provide an additional, albeit reversible, mechanism for controlling caspase activity in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Overexpression of Arabidopsis Dehydration Response Element Binding 1a (DREB1a) is a well-known approach for developing salinity, cold and/or drought stress tolerance. However, understanding of the genetic mechanisms associated with DREB1a expression in rice is generally limited. In this study, DREB1a associated early responses were investigated in a transgenic rice line harboring cold-inducible DREB1a at a gene stacked locus. While the function of other genes in the stacked locus was not relevant to stress tolerance, this study demonstrates DREB1a can be colocalized with other genes for multigenic trait enhancement. As expected, the transgenic lines displayed improved tolerance to salinity stress and water withholding when compared to non-transgenic controls. RNA sequencing and transcriptome analysis showed upregulation of complex transcriptional networks and metabolic reprogramming as DREB1a expression led to the upregulation of multiple transcription factor gene families, suppression of photosynthesis and induction of secondary metabolism. In addition to the detection of previously described mechanisms such as production of protective molecules, potentially novel pathways were also revealed. These include jasmonate, auxin, and ethylene signaling, induction of JAZ and WRKY regulons, trehalose synthesis and polyamine catabolism. These genes regulate various stress responses and ensure timely attenuation of the stress signal. Furthermore, genes associated with heat stress response were downregulated in DREB1a overexpressing lines, suggesting antagonism between heat and dehydration stress pathways. In summary, through a complex transcriptional network, multiple stress signaling pathways are induced by DREB1a that presumably lead to early perception and rapid response towards stress tolerance as well as attenuation of the signal to prevent deleterious effects of the runoff response.",

    "abstract": "The liver has a remarkable capacity to regenerate and thus compensates for repeated injuries through toxic chemicals, drugs, alcohol or malnutrition for decades. However, largely unknown is how and when alterations in the liver occur due to tolerable damaging insults. To that end, we induced repeated liver injuries over ten weeks in a mouse model injecting carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) twice a week. We lost 10% of the study animals within the first six weeks, which was accompanied by a steady deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) regardless of metabolic activity of the liver. From week six onwards, all mice survived, and in these mice ECM deposition was rather reduced, suggesting ECM remodeling as a liver response contributing to better coping with repeated injuries. The data of time-resolved paired transcriptome and proteome profiling of 18 mice was subjected to multi-level network inference, using Knowledge guided Multi-Omics Network inference (KiMONo), identified multi-level key markers exclusively associated with the injury-tolerant liver response. Interestingly, pathways of cancer and inflammation were lighting up and were validated using independent data sets compiled of 1034 samples from publicly available human cohorts. A yet undescribed link to lipid metabolism in this damage-tolerant phase was identified. Immunostaining revealed an unexpected accumulation of small lipid droplets (microvesicular steatosis) in parallel to a recovery of catabolic processes of the liver to pre-injury levels. Further, mild inflammation was experimentally validated. Taken together, we identified week six as a critical time point to switch the liver response program from an acute response that fosters ECM accumulation to a tolerant \"survival\" phase with pronounced deposition of small lipid droplets in hepatocytes potentially protecting against the repetitive injury with toxic chemicals. Our data suggest that microsteatosis formation plus a mild inflammatory state represent biomarkers and probably functional liver requirements to resist chronic damage.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/476054v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ecc7aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1027df5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9ba0f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@164f80a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG The datasets generated via transcriptomics, proteomics as well as blood, histopathological and biochemical analysis were analyzed in an independent and integrative manner.

    "abstract": "Chromatin-based mechanisms regulating developmental transitions during meiosis are fundamental but understudied aspects of male gametogenesis. Indeed, chromatin undergoes extensive remodeling during meiosis, leading to specific patterns of gene expression and chromosome organization, which ultimately controls fundamental meiotic processes such as recombination and homologous chromo-some associations. Recent game-changing advances have been made by analysis of chromatin binding sites of meiotic specific proteins genome-wide in mouse spermatocytes. However, further progress is still highly dependent on the reliable isolation of sufficient quantities of spermatocytes at specific stages of prophase I. Here, we describe a combination of methodologies adapted for rapid and reliable isolation of synchronized fixed mouse spermatocytes. We show that chromatin isolated from these cells can be used to study chromatin binding sites by ChIP-seq. High quality data we obtained from INO80 ChIP-seq in zygotene cells was used for functional analysis of chromatin binding sites.",

    "abstract": "Multi-Parameter Mapping (MPM) is a comprehensive quantitative neuroimaging protocol that enables estimation of four physical parameters (longitudinal and effective transverse relaxation rates R1 and [Formula], proton density PD, and magnetization transfer saturation MTsat) that are sensitive to microstructural tissue properties such as iron and myelin content. Their capability to reveal microstructural brain differences, however, is tightly bound to controlling random noise and artefacts (e.g. caused by head motion) in the signal. Here, we introduced a method to estimate the local error of PD, R1 and MTsat maps that captures both noise and artefacts on a routine basis without requiring additional data. To investigate the methods sensitivity to random noise, we calculated the model-based signal-to-noise ratio (mSNR) and showed in measurements and simulations that it correlated linearly with an experimental raw-image-based SNR map. We found that the mSNR varied with MPM protocols, magnetic field strength (3T vs. 7T) and MPM parameters: it halved from PD to R1 and decreased from PD to MTsat by a factor of 3-4. Exploring the artefact-sensitivity of the error maps, we generated robust MPM parameters using two successive acquisitions of each contrast and the acquisition-specific errors to down-weight erroneous regions. The resulting robust MPM parameters showed reduced variability at the group level as compared to their single-repeat or averaged counterparts. The error and mSNR maps may better inform power-calculations by accounting for local data quality variations across measurements. Code to compute the mSNR maps and robustly combined MPM maps is available in the open-source hMRI toolbox.",

    "abstract": "Stop-signal tasks (SSTs) combined with human electro-cortical recordings (Event-Related Potentials, ERPs) have revealed mechanisms associated with successful stopping (relative to failed), presumably contributing to inhibitory control. The corresponding ERP signatures have been labeled stop N1 (+/- 100-ms latency), stop N2 (200 ms), and stop P3 (160-250 ms), and argued to reflect more proactive (N1) versus more reactive (N2, P3) mechanisms. However, stop N1 and stop N2, as well as latencies of stop-P3, appear to be quite inconsistent across studies. The present work addressed the possible influence of stop-signal salience, expecting high salience to induce clear stop N1s but reduced stop N2s, and short-latency stop P3s.\n\nThree SST varieties were combined with high-resolution EEG. An imperative visual (go) stimulus was occasionally followed by a subsequent (stop) stimulus that signalled to withhold the just initiated response. Stop-Signal Reaction Times (SSRTs) decreased linearly from visual-low to visual-high-salience to auditory. Auditory Stop N1 was replicated. A C1-like visual evoked potential (latency < 100 ms) was observed only with high salience, but not robustly associated with successful versus failed stops. Using the successful-failed contrast a visual stop-N1 analogue (112-156 ms post-stop-signal) was identified, as was right-frontal stop N2, but neither was sensitive to salience. Stop P3 had shorter latency for high than for low salience, and the extent of the early high-salience stop P3 correlated inversely with SSRT. These results suggest that salience-enhanced inhibitory control as manifest in SSRTs is associated with reactive rather than proactive electrocortical mechanisms.",

In this article, we introduce a unique approach that combines dynamics and electrophoresis light scattering experiments, an extended semiflexible worm-like chain model, and an asymmetric polymer length distribution theory to characterize the polyelectrolyte and hydrodynamic properties of actin filaments in aqueous electrolyte solutions. A fitting approach was used to optimize the theories and filament models for hydrodynamic conditions. We used the same sample and experimental conditions and considered several g-actin and polymerization buffers to elucidate the impact of their chemical composition, reducing agents, pH values, and ionic strengths on the filament translational diffusion coefficient, electrophoretic mobility, structure factor, asymmetric length distribution, effective filament diameter, electric charge, zeta potential, and semiflexibility. Compared to those values obtained from molecular structure models, our results revealed a lower value of the effective G-actin charge and a more significant value of the effective filament diameter due to the formation of the double layer of the electrolyte surrounding the filaments. Contrary to the data usually reported from electron micrographs, the lower values of our results for the persistence length and average contour filament length agree with the significant difference in the association rates at the filament ends that shift to sub-micro lengths, the maximum of the length distribution.",

    "abstract": "GABAergic interneurons within the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus regulate adult neurogenesis, including proliferation, migration, and maturation of new granule cells born in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG). In temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), some adult-born granule cells migrate ectopically into the hilus, and these cells contribute to increased hyperexcitability and seizures. Yet, transplanting embryonic day 13.5 fetal mouse medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) GABAergic progenitors into the hippocampus of mice with TLE ameliorates spontaneous seizures, due in part, to increased postsynaptic inhibition of adult-born granule cells. Here, we asked whether MGE progenitor transplantation affects earlier stages of adult neurogenesis, by comparing patterns of neurogenesis in naive mice and epileptic (TLE) mice, with or without MGE transplants. In naive and TLE mice, transplanted MGE cells showed comparable migration and process outgrowth. However, in TLE mice with MGE transplants, fewer adult-born Type 3 progenitors migrated ectopically. Furthermore, more Type 3 progenitors survived and migrated into the granule cell layer (GCL), as determined by immunostaining for doublecortin or the thymidine analogue, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). To determine whether MGE transplants affected earlier stages of adult neurogenesis, we compared proliferation in the SGZ two-hours after pulse labeling with BrdU in Naive vs. TLE mice and found no significant differences. Furthermore, MGE progenitor transplantation had no effect on cell proliferation in the SGZ. Moreover, when compared to naive mice, TLE mice showed increases in inverted Type 1 progenitors and Type 2 progenitors, concomitant with a decrease in the normally oriented radial Type 1 progenitors. Strikingly, these alterations were abrogated by MGE transplantation. Thus, MGE transplants appear to reverse seizure-induced abnormalities in adult neurogenesis by increasing differentiation and radial migration of adult-born granule cell progenitors, outcomes that may ameliorate seizures.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the UBQLN2 gene cause X-linked dominant amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and/or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) characterised by ubiquilin 2 aggregates in neurons of the motor cortex, hippocampus, and spinal cord. However, ubiquilin 2 neuropathology is also seen in sporadic and familial ALS or FTD cases not caused by UBQLN2 mutations, particularly C9orf72-linked cases. This makes the mechanistic role of ubiquilin 2 mutations and the value of ubiquilin 2 pathology for predicting genotype unclear. Here we examine a cohort of 41 genotypically diverse ALS cases with or without FTD, including five cases with UBQLN2 variants (resulting in p.S222G, p.P497H, p.P506S, and two cases with p.T487I). Using multiplexed (5-label) fluorescent immunohistochemistry, we mapped the co-localisation of ubiquilin 2 with phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43), dipeptide repeat aggregates, and p62, in the hippocampus of controls (n=5), or ALS with or without FTD in sporadic (n=20), unknown familial (n=3), SOD1-linked (n=1), FUS-linked (n=1), C9orf72-linked (n=5), and UBQLN2-linked (n=5) cases. We differentiate between i) ubiquilin 2 aggregation together with pTDP-43 or dipeptide repeat proteins, and ii) ubiquilin 2 self-aggregation promoted by UBQLN2 gene mutations that cause ALS/FTD. Overall, we describe a hippocampal protein aggregation signature that fully distinguishes mutant from wildtype ubiquilin 2 in ALS with or without FTD, whereby mutant ubiquilin 2 is more prone than wildtype to aggregate independently of driving factors. This neuropathological signature can be used to assess the pathogenicity of UBQLN2 gene variants and to understand the mechanisms of UBQLN2-linked disease.",

    "abstract": "Responses to visually-presented objects along the cortical surface of the human brain have a large-scale organization reflecting the broad categorical divisions of animacy and object size. Mounting evidence indicates that this topographical organization is driven by differences between objects in mid-level perceptual features. With regard to the timing of neural responses, images of objects quickly evoke neural responses with decodable information about animacy and object size, but are mid-level features sufficient to evoke these rapid neural responses? Or is slower iterative neural processing required to untangle information about animacy and object size from mid-level features? To answer this question, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to measure human neural responses to images of objects and their texform counterparts - unrecognizable images which preserve some mid-level feature information about texture and coarse form. We found that texform images evoked neural responses with early decodable information about both animacy and real-world size, as early as responses evoked by original images. Further, successful cross-decoding indicates that both texform and original images evoke information about animacy and size through a common underlying neural basis. Broadly, these results indicate that the visual system contains a mid-level feature bank carrying linearly decodable information on animacy and size, which can be rapidly activated without requiring explicit recognition or protracted temporal processing.",

Recent studies show that propofol, a widely used anesthetic, dramatically alters cortical oscillations by increasing slow-delta oscillatory power and coherence. It is not known how this affects traveling waves. We compared traveling waves across the cortex of non-human primates (NHPs) before, during, and after propofol-induced loss-of-consciousness (LOC). After LOC, traveling waves in the slow-delta ([~] 1Hz) range increased, grew more organized, and travelled in different directions relative to the awake state. Higher frequency (8-30 Hz) traveling waves, by contrast, decreased, lost structure, and switched to directions where the slow-delta waves were less frequent. The results suggest that LOC may be due, in part, to changes in slow-delta traveling waves that, in turn, alter and disrupt traveling waves in the higher frequencies associated with cognition.",

Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, clones of the MDA-MB-231 line knockout for the GPR55, CB1, CB2, GPR18, and TRPV1 receptor genes were obtained. On clones of the MDA-MB-231 line with a knockout CB2 receptor, the cytotoxic activity of the pro-apoptotic ligand docosahexaenoyldopamine (DHA-DA) did not change or slightly increased, while the pro-proliferative activity of the most active synthetic ligand of the GPR55 receptor (ML-184) completely disappeared. On the original line MDA-MB-231, the stimulatory effect of ML-184 is removed by the CB2 receptor blocker, but not by GPR55. At the same time, the stimulating effect of ML-184 is practically not manifested on cell lines knockout at the GPR55 receptor. Thus, it can be confidently assumed that when proliferation is stimulated with the participation of the GPR55 receptor, a signal is transmitted from the CB2 receptor to the GPR55 receptor due to the formation of a heterodimer. GPR18 and TRPV1 receptors are additionally involved in the implementation of the cytotoxic effect of DHA-DA, while the CB1 receptor is not involved. In the implementation of the cytotoxic action of DHA-DA, the predominant participation of one of the G subunits was not found, but the G13 subunit plays a decisive role in the implementation of the proproliferative action.",

    "abstract": "Metabarcoding analysis of environmental DNA samples is a promising new tool for marine biodiversity and conservation. Typically, seawater samples are obtained using Niskin bottles and filtered to collect eDNA. However, standard sample volumes are small relative to the scale of the environment, conventional collection strategies are limited, and the filtration process is time consuming. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new large - volume eDNA sampler with in situ filtration, capable of taking up to 12 samples per deployment. We conducted three deployments of our sampler on the robotic vehicle Mesobot in the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and collected samples from 20 to 400 m depth. We compared the large volume ([~]40 - 60 liters) samples collected by Mesobot with small volume ([~]2 liters) samples collected using the conventional CTD - mounted Niskin bottle approach. We sequenced the V9 region of 18S rRNA, which detects a broad range of invertebrate taxa, and found that while both methods detected biodiversity changes associated with depth, our large volume samples detected approximately 66% more taxa than the CTD small volume samples. We found that the fraction of the eDNA signal originating from metazoans relative to the total eDNA signal decreased with sampling depth, indicating that larger volume samples may be especially important for detecting metazoans in mesopelagic and deep ocean environments. We also noted substantial variability in biological replicates from both the large volume Mesobot and small volume CTD sample sets. Both of the sample sets also identified taxa that the other did not - although the number of unique taxa associated with the Mesobot samples was almost four times larger than those from the CTD samples. Large volume eDNA sampling with in situ filtration, particularly when coupled with robotic platforms, has great potential for marine biodiversity surveys, and we discuss practical methodological and sampling considerations for future applications.",

    "abstract": "O_LISoundscape studies are increasingly common to capture landscape-scale ecological patterns. Yet, several aspects of soundscape diversity quantification remain unexplored. Although some processes influencing acoustic niche usage may operate in the 24h domain, most acoustic indices only capture the diversity of sounds co-occurring in sound files at a specific time of day. Moreover, many indices do not consider the relationship between the spectral and temporal traits of sounds simultaneously. To provide novel insights into landscape-scale patterns of acoustic niche usage at broader temporal scales, we present a workflow to quantify soundscape diversity through the lens of functional ecology.\nC_LIO_LIOur workflow quantifies the functional diversity of sound in the 24-hour acoustic trait space. We put forward an entity, the Operational Sound Unit (OSU), which groups sounds by their shared functional properties. Using OSUs as our unit of diversity measurement, and building on the framework of Hill numbers, we propose three metrics that capture different aspects of acoustic trait space usage: (i) soundscape richness; (ii) soundscape diversity; (iii) soundscape evenness. We demonstrate the use of these metrics by (a) simulating soundscapes to assess if the indices possess a set of desirable behaviours; and (b) quantifying the soundscape richness and evenness along a gradient in species richness to illustrate how these metrics can be used to shed unique insights into patterns of acoustic niche usage.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that: (a) the indices outlined herein have desirable behaviours; and (b) the soundscape richness and evenness are positively correlated with the richness of soniferous species. This suggests that the acoustic niche space is more filled where taxonomic richness is higher. Moreover, species-poor acoustic communities have a higher proportion of rare sounds and use the acoustic space less effectively. As the correlation between the soundscape and taxonomic richness is strong (>0.8) and holds at low sampling intensities, soundscape richness could serve as a proxy for taxonomic richness.\nC_LIO_LIQuantifying the soundscape diversity through the lens of functional ecology using the analytical framework of Hill numbers generates novel insights into acoustic niche usage at a landscape scale and provides a useful proxy for taxonomic richness measurement.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The kidney is an essential organ that ensures bodily fluid homeostasis and removes soluble waste products from the organism. The functional units within the kidneys are epithelial tubules called nephrons. These tubules take in filtrate from the blood or coelom and selectively reabsorb nutrients through evolutionarily conserved nephron segments, leaving waste product to be eliminated in the urine. Genes coding for functional transporters are segmentally expressed, enabling nephrons to function as selective filters. The developmental patterning program that generates these segments is of great interest. The Xenopus embryonic kidney, the pronephros, has served as a valuable model to identify genes involved in nephron formation and patterning. Prior work has defined the gene expression profiles of Xenopus epithelial nephron segments via in situ hybridization strategies, but our understanding of the cellular makeup of the Xenopus pronephric kidney remains incomplete. Here, we scrutinize the cellular composition of the Xenopus pronephric nephron through comparative analyses with previous Xenopus studies and single-cell mRNA sequencing of the adult mouse kidney, this study reconstructs the cellular makeup of the pronephric kidney and identifies conserved cells, segments, and expression profiles. The data highlight significant conservation in podocytes, proximal and distal tubule cells and divergence in cellular composition underlying the evolution of the corticomedullary axis, while emphasizing the Xenopus pronephros as a model for physiology and disease.\n\nSummary StatementAssessment of the conservation of gene expression between functional Xenopus laevis pronephric and mouse metanephric nephrons through single-cell RNA sequencing.",

    "abstract": "The reliable mapping of species richness is a crucial step for the identification of areas of high conservation priority, alongside other value considerations. This is commonly done by overlapping range maps of individual species, which requires dense availability of occurrence data or relies on assumptions about the presence of species in unsampled areas deemed suitable by environmental niche models. Here we present a deep learning approach that directly estimates species richness, skipping the step of estimating individual species ranges. We train a neural network model based on species lists from inventory plots, which provide ground truthing for supervised machine learning. The model learns to predict species richness based on spatially associated variables, including climatic and geographic predictors, as well as counts of available species records from online databases. We assess the empirical utility of our approach by producing independently verifiable maps of alpha, beta and gamma plant diversity at high spatial resolutions for Australia, a continent with highly contrasting diversity patterns. Our deep learning framework provides a powerful and flexible new approach for estimating biodiversity patterns.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of gene expression via cis-regulatory changes is well established as a major driver of phenotypic evolution. However, relatively little is known about the influence of enhancer architecture and intergenic interactions on regulatory evolution. We address this question by examining chemosensory system evolution in Drosophila. D. prolongata males show a massively increased number of chemosensory bristles compared to females and males of sibling species. This increase is driven by sex-specific transformation of ancestrally mechanosensory organs. Consistent with this phenotype, the Pox neuro transcription factor (Poxn), which specifies chemosensory bristle identity, shows expanded expression in D. prolongata males. Poxn expression is controlled by non-additive interactions among widely dispersed enhancers. Although some D. prolongata Poxn enhancers show increased activity, the additive component of this increase is slight, suggesting most changes in Poxn expression are due to epistatic interactions between Poxn enhancers and trans-regulatory factors. Indeed, the expansion of D. prolongata Poxn enhancer activity is only observed in cells that express doublesex (dsx), the gene that controls sexual differentiation in Drosophila and also shows increased expression in D. prolongata males due to cis-regulatory changes. Although expanded dsx expression may contribute to increased activity of D. prolongata Poxn enhancers, this interaction is not sufficient to explain the full expansion of Poxn expression, suggesting that cis-trans interactions between Poxn, dsx, and additional unknown genes are necessary to produce the derived D. prolongata phenotype. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of epistatic gene interactions for evolution, particularly when pivotal genes have complex regulatory architecture.\n\nResearch HighlightsIn Drosophila prolongata males, many mechanosensory organs are transformed into chemosensory. This is due in part to interacting regulatory changes in Poxn, which controls chemosensory organ development, and dsx, which controls sexual differentiation.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=194 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/475924v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (65K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b5b5borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ac2ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b6db0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15e4c6b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Many traits of industrial and basic biological interest arose long ago, and manifest now as fixed differences between a focal species and its reproductively isolated relatives. In these systems, extant individuals can hold clues to the mechanisms by which phenotypes evolved in their ancestors. We harnessed yeast thermotolerance as a test case for such molecular-genetic inferences. In viability experiments, we showed that extant Saccharomyces cerevisiae survived at temperatures where cultures of its sister species S. paradoxus died out. Then, focusing on loci that contribute to this difference, we found that the genetic mechanisms of high-temperature growth changed with temperature. We also uncovered an enrichment of low-frequency variants at thermotolerance loci in S. cerevisiae population sequences, suggestive of a history of non-neutral selective forces acting at these genes. We interpret our results in light of a model of gradual acquisition of thermotolerance in the S. cerevisiae lineage by positive selection along a temperature cline. We propose that in an ancestral S. cerevisiae population, alleles conferring defects at a given temperature would have been resolved by adaptive mutations, expanding the range and setting the stage for further temperature advances. Together, our results and interpretation underscore the power of genetic approaches to explore how an ancient trait came to be.",

    "abstract": "Circadian clocks are highly conserved transcriptional regulators that control 24-hour oscillations in gene expression, physiological function, and behavior. Circadian clocks exist in almost every tissue and are thought to control tissue-specific gene expression and function, synchronized by the brain clock. Many disease states are associated with loss of circadian regulation. How and when circadian clocks fail during pathogenesis remains largely unknown because it is currently difficult to monitor tissue-specific clock function in intact organisms. Here, we developed a method to directly measure the transcriptional oscillation of distinct neuronal and peripheral clocks in live, intact Drosophila, which we term Locally Activatable BioLuminescence or LABL. Using this method, we observed that specific neuronal and peripheral clocks exhibit distinct transcription properties. Loss of the receptor for PDF, a circadian neurotransmitter critical for the function of the brain clock, disrupts circadian locomotor activity but not all tissue-specific circadian clocks; we found that, while peripheral clocks in non-neuronal tissues were less stable after the loss of PDF signaling, they continued to oscillate. This result suggests that the presumed dominance of the brain clock in regulating peripheral clocks needs to be re-examined. This result further demonstrates that LABL allows rapid, affordable, and direct real-time monitoring of clocks in vivo.",

    "abstract": "We propose MT-MAG, a novel machine learning-based software tool for the complete or partial hierarchically-structured taxonomic classification of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs). MT-MAG is alignment-free, with k-mer frequencies being the only feature used to distinguish a DNA sequence from another (herein k = 7). MT-MAG is capable of classifying large and diverse metagenomic datasets: a total of 245.68 Gbp in the training sets, and 9.6 Gbp in the test sets analyzed in this study. In addition to complete classifications, MT-MAG offers a \"partial classification\" option, whereby a classification at a higher taxonomic level is provided for MAGs that cannot be classified to the Species level. MT-MAG outputs complete or partial classification paths, and interpretable numerical classification confidences of its classifications, at all taxonomic ranks. To assess the performance of MT-MAG, we define a \"weighted classification accuracy,\" with a weighting scheme reflecting the fact that partial classifications at different ranks are not equally informative. For the two benchmarking datasets analyzed (genomes from human gut microbiome species, and bacterial and archaeal genomes assembled from cow rumen metagenomic sequences), MT-MAG achieves an average of 87.32% in weighted classification accuracy. At the Species level, MT-MAG outperforms DeepMicrobes, the only other comparable software tool, by an average of 34.79% in weighted classification accuracy. In addition, MT-MAG is able to completely classify an average of 67.70% of the sequences at the Species level, compared with DeepMicrobes which only classifies 47.45%. Moreover, MT-MAG provides additional information for sequences that it could not classify at the Species level, resulting in the partial or complete classification of 95.13%, of the genomes in the datasets analyzed. Lastly, unlike other taxonomic assignment tools (e.g., GDTB-Tk), MT-MAG is an alignment-free and genetic marker-free tool, able to provide additional bioinformatics analysis to confirm existing or tentative taxonomic assignments.",

Here we use multiplexed tissue imaging and single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize the composition, spatial organization, and clinical significance of extracellular purinergic signaling in glioblastoma. We show that glioblastoma exhibit strong expression of CD39 and CD73 ectoenzymes, correlating with increased adenosine levels. Microglia are the predominant source of CD39, while CD73 is principally expressed by tumor cells, particularly in tumors with amplification of EGFR and astrocyte-like differentiation. Spatially-resolved single-cell analyses demonstrate strong spatial correlation between tumor CD73 and microglial CD39, and that their spatial proximity is associated with poor clinical outcomes. Together, this data reveals that tumor CD73 expression correlates with tumor genotype, lineage differentiation, and functional states, and that core purine regulatory enzymes expressed by neoplastic and tumor-associated myeloid cells interact to promote a distinctive adenosine-rich signaling niche and immunosuppressive microenvironment potentially amenable to therapeutic targeting.",

    "abstract": "Anemia is a clinical hallmark and independent risk factor of malaria mortality, the disease caused by Plasmodium spp. infection. While malarial anemia arises from parasite-induced hemolysis, whether and how host metabolic adaptation to malaria regulates anemia severity is less understood. Here we demonstrate that reprogramming of organismal iron (Fe) metabolism by the kidneys is a central component of the host metabolic response regulating the pathogenesis of life-threatening malarial anemia. Renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) are the main cell compartment responsible for Fe storage and recycling during Plasmodium infection in mice. Transcriptional reprogramming of RPTEC couples immune resistance to Plasmodium infection to renal Fe export via the induction of the cellular Fe exporter SLC40A1/ferroportin 1. This integrated defense strategy is essential to deliver Fe to erythroblasts and support compensatory erythropoiesis to prevent the development of life-threatening anemia. Failure to mobilize Fe from RPTEC causes acute kidney injury (AKI) and is associated with life-threatening anemia in P. falciparum-infected individuals. These findings reveal an unexpected role of the kidneys in the control of organismal Fe metabolism and anemia severity during malaria.",

    "abstract": "Sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) is an important commercial citrus fruit crop, cultivated in India and across the world. In India most of the cultivated sweet orange species were introduced varieties. In this study, we used two molecular markers,SSR and InDels, to understand the genetic diversity and population structure of seventy-two sweet orange genotypes. Genetic parameters consisted of total number of alleles, number of polymorphic alleles (effective alleles); genetic diversity (G.D.), expected heterozygosity (He) and polymorphic information content (PIC) were calculated based on molecular data. Two dendrograms were constructed based on the InDels and SSR. In the both the cases they formed three major clusters showing various degrees of variations with respect to members of the clusters. Population structure analysis revealed presence of two distinct sub populations. Therefore, in order to address various challenges and develop sweet orange varieties with desirable traits, there is a need to broaden the genetic base of sweet orange through intensive collection in the northeastern region. These results of intra-specific genetic variability of the collections will dictate the path for the sweet orange breeding and conservation programs in India.",

    "abstract": "Petal senescence is controlled by a complex regulatory network. Epigenetic regulation like histone modification influences chromatin state and gene expression. However, involvement of histone methylation in regulating petal senescence is still largely unknown. Here, we found that the trimethylation of histone H3 at Lysine 4 (H3K4me3) is increased during the ethylene induced petal senescence in carnation (Dianthus caryophyllus L.). The H3K4me3 levels are positively associated with the expression of transcription factor DcWRKY75, ethylene biosynthetic genes DcACS1 and DcACO1, and senescence associated genes (SAGs) DcSAG12 and DcSAG29. Further, we identified that carnation DcATX1 (ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG OF TRITHORAX1) encodes a histone lysine methyltransferase which can methylate H3K4. Knockdown of DcATX1 delays ethylene induced petal senescence in carnation, which is associated with the downregulated expression of DcWRKY75, DcACO1 and DcSAG12. While overexpression of DcATX1 exhibits the opposite effects. DcATX1 promotes the transcription of DcWRKY75, DcACO1 and DcSAG12 by targeting to their promoters to elevate the H3K4me3 levels. Overall, our results demonstrate that DcATX1 is a H3K4 methyltransferase that promotes the expression of DcWRKY75, DcACO1 and DcSAG12 by regulating H3K4me3 levels, thereby accelerating ethylene induced petal senescence in carnation. This study further indicates that epigenetic regulation is important for plant senescence process.\n\nOne sentence summaryA histone methyltransferase promotes ethylene induced petal senescence in cut flower",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe sequential activity of gut microbial and host processes can exert a powerful modulatory influence on dietary components, as exemplified by the metabolism of the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine to p-cresol by gut microbes, and then to p-cresol glucuronide (pCG) by host enzymes. Although such glucuronide conjugates are classically thought to be biologically inert, there is accumulating evidence that this may not always be the case. We investigated the activity of pCG, studying its interactions with the cerebral vasculature and the brain in vitro and in vivo.\n\nMethodsMale C57Bl/6J mice were used to assess blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability and whole brain transcriptomic changes in response to pCG treatment. Effects were then further explored using the human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3, assessing paracellular permeability, transendothelial electrical resistance and barrier protein expression.\n\nResultsMice exposed to pCG showed reduced BBB permeability and significant changes in whole brain transcriptome expression. Surprisingly, treatment of hCMEC/D3 cells with pCG had no notable effects until co-administered with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, at which point it was able to prevent the permeabilising effects of endotoxin. Further analysis suggested that pCG acts as an antagonist at the principal lipopolysaccharide receptor TLR4.\n\nConclusionThe amino acid phase II metabolic product pCG is biologically active at the BBB, highlighting the complexity of gut microbe to host communication and the gut-brain axis.",

    "abstract": "Periodic gene expression dynamics are key to cell and organism physiology. Studies of oscillatory expression have focused on networks with intuitive regulatory negative feedback loops, leaving unknown whether other common biochemical reactions can produce oscillations. Oscillation and noise have been proposed to support mammalian progenitor cells capacity to restore heterogenous, multimodal expression from extreme subpopulations, but underlying networks and specific roles of noise remained elusive. We use mass-action-based models to show that regulated RNA degradation involving as few as two RNA species--applicable to nearly half of human protein-coding genes--can generate sustained oscillations without imposed feedback. Diverging oscillation periods synergize with noise to robustly restore cell populations bimodal expression. The global bifurcation organizing this divergence relies on an oscillator and bistable switch which cannot be decomposed into two structural modules. Our work reveals surprisingly rich dynamics of post-transcriptional reactions and a potentially widespread mechanism useful for development and regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The study of pattern formation has benefited from reverse-engineering gene regulatory network (GRN) structure from spatio-temporal quantitative gene expression data. Traditional approaches omit tissue morphogenesis, hence focusing on systems where the timescales of pattern formation and morphogenesis can be separated. In such systems, pattern forms as an emergent property of the underlying GRN. This is not the case in many animal patterning systems, where patterning and morphogenesis are simultaneous. To address pattern formation in these systems we need to adapt our methodologies to explicitly accommodate cell movements and tissue shape changes. In this work we present a novel framework to reverse-engineer GRNs underlying pattern formation in tissues experiencing morphogenetic changes and cell rearrangements. By combination of quantitative data from live and fixed embryos we approximate gene expression trajectories (AGETs) in single cells and use a subset to reverse-engineer candidate GRNs using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach. GRN fit is assessed by simulating on cell tracks (live-modelling) and comparing the output to quantitative data-sets. This framework outputs candidate GRNs that recapitulate pattern formation at the level of the tissue and the single cell. To our knowledge, this inference methodology is the first to integrate cell movements and gene expression data, making it possible to reverse-engineer GRNs patterning tissues undergoing morphogenetic changes.",

We compared two strains of hydra, a strain of hydra that was capable of regenerating from aggregates and a strain of hydra that was deficient in this type of regeneration. We observed unique actin cytoskeletal arrangements that were present in the regenerates of regeneration-competent strain but not in the regeneration-deficient strain. Concomitantly, the regeneration-deficient strain failed to organise the extracellular cytoskeleton of laminin and collagen between ectodermal and endodermal epithelial cells. These interesting preliminary observations highlight the importance of the cytoskeletal organisation in regeneration of hydra and suggest that regeneration from the aggregates of dissociated cells through de novo patterning requires correct structural organisation of cytoskeletal elements.",

    "abstract": "Substance abuse and addiction represent a significant public health problem that impacts multiple dimensions of society, including healthcare, the economy, and the workforce. In 2021, over 100,000 drug overdose deaths were reported in the US, with an alarming increase in fatalities related to opioids and psychostimulants. Understanding the fundamental gene regulatory mechanisms underlying addiction and related behaviors could facilitate more effective treatments. To explore how repeated drug exposure alters gene regulatory networks in the brain, we combined capped small (cs)RNA-seq, which accurately captures nascent-like initiating transcripts from total RNA, with Hi-C and single nuclei (sn)ATAC-seq. We profiled initiating transcripts in two addiction-related brain regions, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), from rats that were never exposed to drugs or were subjected to prolonged abstinence after oxycodone or cocaine intravenous self-administration (IVSA). Interrogating over 100,000 active transcription start regions (TSRs) revealed that most TSRs had hallmarks of bonafide enhancers and highlighted the KLF/SP1, RFX, and AP1 transcription factors families as central to establishing brain-specific gene regulatory programs. Analysis of rats with addiction-like behaviors versus controls identified addiction-associated repression of transcription at regulatory enhancers recognized by nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C (NR3C) factors, which include glucocorticoid receptors. Cell-type deconvolution analysis using snATAC-seq uncovered a potential role of glial cells in driving the gene regulatory programs associated with addiction-related phenotypes. These findings highlight the power of advanced transcriptomics methods to provide insight into how addiction perturbs gene regulatory programs in the brain.",

    "abstract": "The dentate gyrus is a key relay station that controls information transfer from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus proper. This process heavily relies on dendritic integration by dentate granule cells (GCs) of excitatory synaptic inputs from medial and lateral entorhinal cortex via medial and lateral perforant paths (MPP and LPP, respectively). N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) can contribute significantly to the integrative properties of neurons. While early studies reported that excitatory inputs from entorhinal cortex onto GCs can undergo activity-dependent long-term plasticity of NMDAR-mediated transmission, the input-specificity of this plasticity along the dendritic axis remains unknown. Here, we examined the NMDAR plasticity rules at MPP-GC and LPP-GC synapses using physiologically relevant patterns of stimulation in acute rat hippocampal slices. We found that MPP-GC, but not LPP-GC synapses, expressed homosynaptic NMDAR-LTP. In addition, induction of NMDAR-LTP at MPP-GC synapses heterosynaptically potentiated distal LPP-GC NMDAR plasticity. The same stimulation protocol induced homosynaptic -amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-LTP at MPP-GC but heterosynaptic AMPAR-LTD at distal LPP synapses, demonstrating that NMDAR and AMPAR are governed by different plasticity rules. Remarkably, heterosynaptic but not homosynaptic NMDAR-LTP required Ca2+ release from intracellular, ryanodine-dependent Ca2+ stores. Lastly, the induction and maintenance of both homo- and heterosynaptic NMDAR-LTP were blocked by GluN2D antagonism, suggesting the recruitment of GluN2D-containing receptors to the synapse. Our findings uncover a mechanism by which distinct inputs to the dentate gyrus may interact functionally and contribute to hippocampal-dependent memory formation.\n\nSignificance StatementNMDARs are key players in synaptic plasticity. In addition to their classical role as coincidence detectors and triggers of AMPAR plasticity, there is compelling evidence that NMDARs can undergo activity-dependent plasticity independent of AMPAR plasticity. However, whether NMDAR-plasticity is expressed heterosynaptically remains unclear. Here, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, we show that the induction of burst timing-dependent LTP of NMDAR-mediated transmission at proximal medial perforant path synapses is accompanied by heterosynaptic NMDAR-LTP at lateral perforant path synapses. These findings provide the first evidence for heterosynaptic NMDAR plasticity, which may have important consequences on the dendritic integration of functionally distinct excitatory inputs by dentate granule cells.",

    "abstract": "Functional forms of biophysically-realistic neuron models are constrained by neurobiological and anatomical considerations, such as cell morphologies and the presence of known ion channels. Despite these constraints, neurons models still contain unknown static parameters which must be inferred from experiment. This inference task is most readily cast into the framework of state-space models, which systematically takes into account partial observability and measurement noise. Inferring only dynamical state variables such as membrane voltages is a well-studied problem, and has been approached with a wide range of techniques beginning with the well-known Kalman filter. Inferring both states and fixed parameters, on the other hand, is less straightforward. Here, we develop a method for joint parameter and state inference that combines traditional state space modeling with chaotic synchronization and optimal control. Our methods are tailored particularly to situations with considerable measurement noise, sparse observability, very nonlinear or chaotic dynamics, and highly uninformed priors. We illustrate our approach both in a canonical chaotic model and in a phenomenological neuron model, showing that many unknown parameters can be uncovered reliably and accurately from short and noisy observed time traces. Our method holds promise for estimation in larger-scale systems, given ongoing improvements in calcium reporters and genetically-encoded voltage indicators.",

To understand the underlying neural computations, we recorded brain activity in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of monkeys navigating by optic flow to a hidden target location within a virtual environment, without explicit position cues. In addition to sequential neural dynamics and strong interneuronal interactions, we found that the hidden state - monkeys displacement from the goal - was encoded in single neurons, and could be dynamically decoded from population activity. The decoded estimates predicted navigation performance on individual trials. Task manipulations that perturbed the world model induced substantial changes in neural interactions, and modified the neural representation of the hidden state, while representations of sensory and motor variables remained stable. The findings were recapitulated by a task-optimized recurrent neural network model, suggesting that neural interactions in PPC embody the world model to consolidate information and track task-relevant hidden states.",

De novo assembled TZTs amongst germline-soma and oocytes accumulated mtDNA amounts of the oocytes in vitro. However, mitochondrial supplement from germline-soma gradually diminished along with oocyte growth and was terminated by meiosis resumption, in line with a decrease in the proportion of germline-soma with thriving mtDNA replication and FSH capture capability.

    "abstract": "Momilactone A, an important plant labdane-related diterpenoid, functions as a phytoalexin against pathogens and an allelochemical against neighboring plants. The genes involved in biosynthesis of momilactone A are found in clusters, i.e., MABGCs (Momilactone A biosynthetic gene clusters), in the rice and barnyardgrass genomes. How MABGCs originate and evolve is still not clear. Here, we integrated results from comprehensive phylogeny and comparative genomic analyses of the core genes of MABGC-like clusters and MABGCs in 40 monocot plant genomes, providing convincing evidence for the birth and evolution of MABGCs in grass species. The MABGCs found in the PACMAD clade of the core grass lineage (including Panicoideae and Chloridoideae) originated from a MABGC-like cluster in Triticeae (BOP clade) via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and followed by recruitment of MAS and CYP76L1 genes. The MABGCs in Oryzoideae originated from PACMAD through another HGT event and lost CYP76L1 afterwards. The Oryza MABGC and another Oryza diterpenoid cluster c2BGC are two distinct clusters, with the latter being originated from gene duplication and relocation within Oryzoideae. Further comparison of the expression patterns of the MABGC genes between rice and barnyardgrass in response to pathogen infection and allelopathy provides novel insights into the functional innovation of MABGCs in plants. Our results demonstrate HGT-mediated origination of MABGCs in grass and shed lights into the evolutionary innovation and optimization of plant biosynthetic pathways.",

    "abstract": "The extent to which horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has shaped eukaryote evolution remains an open question. Two recent studies reported four plant-like genes acquired through two HGT events by the whitefly Bemisia tabaci, a major agricultural pest (Lapadula et al. 2020; Xia et al. 2021). Here, we uncovered a total of 49 plant-like genes deriving from at least 24 independent HGT events in the genome of the MEAM1 whitefly. Orthologs of these genes are present in three cryptic B. tabaci species, they are phylogenetically nested within plant sequences, and expressed and under purifying selection. The predicted functions of these genes suggest that most of them are involved in plant-insect interactions. Thus, substantial plant-to-insect HGT may have facilitated the evolution of B. tabaci towards adaptation to a large host spectrum. Our study shows that eukaryote-to-eukaryote HGT may be relatively common in some lineages and it provides new candidate genes that may be targeted to improve current control strategies against whiteflies.",

    "abstract": "Local adaptation can lead to elevated genetic differentiation at the targeted genetic variant and nearby sites. Selective sweeps come in different forms, and depending on the initial and final frequencies of a favored variant, very different patterns of genetic variation may be produced. If local selection favors an existing variant that had already recombined onto multiple genetic backgrounds, then the width of elevated genetic differentiation (high FST) may be too narrow to detect using a typical windowed genome scan, even if the targeted variant becomes highly differentiated. We therefore used a simulation approach to investigate the power of SNP-level FST (specifically, the maximum SNP FST value within a window) to detect diverse scenarios of local adaptation, and compared it against whole-window FST and the Comparative Haplotype Identity statistic. We found that SNP FST had superior power to detect complete or mostly complete soft sweeps, but lesser power than window-wide statistics to detect partial hard sweeps. To investigate the relative enrichment and nature of SNP FST outliers from real data, we applied the two FST statistics to a panel of Drosophila melanogaster populations. We found that SNP FST had a genome-wide enrichment of outliers compared to demographic expectations, and though it yielded a lesser enrichment than window FST, it detected mostly unique outlier genes and functional categories. Our results suggest that SNP FST is highly complementary to typical window-based approaches for detecting local adaptation, and merits inclusion in future genome scans and methodologies.\n\nSignificance statementStudies that use genetic variation to search for genes evolving under population-specific natural selection tend to analyze data at the level of genomic windows that may each contain hundreds of variable sites. However, some models of natural selection (e.g. favoring an existing genetic variant) may result in genetic signals of local adaptation that are too narrow to be detected by such approaches. Here we use both simulations and empirical data analysis to show that searching for a site-specific signal of elevated genetic differentiation can find instances of local adaptation that other approaches miss, and therefore the integration of this signal into future studies may significantly improve our understanding of adaptive evolution and its genetic targets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn breeding programmes, the observed genetic change is a sum of the contributions of different groups of individuals. Quantifying these sources of genetic change is essential for identifying the key breeding actions and optimizing breeding programmes. However, it is difficult to disentangle the contribution of individual groups due to the inherent complexity of breeding programmes. Here we extend the previously developed method for partitioning genetic mean by paths of selection to work both with the mean and variance of breeding values.\n\nMethodsWe first extended the partitioning method to quantify the contribution of different groups to genetic variance assuming breeding values are known. Second, we combined the partitioning method with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to draw samples from the posterior distribution of breeding values and use these samples for computing the point and interval estimates of partitions for the genetic mean and variance. We implemented the method in the R package AlphaPart. We demonstrated the method with a simulated cattle breeding programme.\n\nResultsWe showed how to quantify the contribution of different groups of individuals to genetic mean and variance. We showed that the contributions of different selection paths to genetic variance are not necessarily independent. Finally, we observed some limitations of the partitioning method under a misspecified model, suggesting the need for a genomic partitioning method.\n\nConclusionWe presented a partitioning method to quantify sources of change in genetic mean and variance in breeding programmes. The method can help breeders and researchers understand the dynamics in genetic mean and variance in a breeding programme. The developed method for partitioning genetic mean and variance is a powerful method for understanding how different paths of selection interact within a breeding programme and how they can be optimised.",

    "abstract": "We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) scores administered in 4207 family members of the Long Life Family Study (LLFS). Genotype data were imputed to the HRC panel of 64,940 haplotypes resulting in ~15M genetic variants with quality score > 0.7. The results were replicated using genetic data imputed to the 1000 Genomes phase 3 reference panel from two Danish twin cohorts: the study of Middle Aged Danish Twins and the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins. The GWAS in LLFS discovered 20 rare genetic variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1.0%) that reached genome-wide significance (p-value < 5x10-8). Among these, 18 variants had large protective effects on the processing speed, including rs7623455, rs9821776, rs9821587, rs78704059 on chromosome 3, which were replicated in the combined Danish twin cohort. These SNPs are located in/near two genes, THRB and RARB, that belonged to thyroid hormone receptors family that may influence speed of metabolism and cognitive aging. The gene-level tests in LLFS confirmed that these two genes are associated with processing speed.",

    "abstract": "A short non-coding sequence present between the gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1) and gamma-glutamyltransferase 5 (GGT5) genes, termed a spacer sequence has been detected in the genomes of Mus musculus, the house mouse and in Philippine tarsier, a primitive ancestral primate. It is highly conserved during primate evolution with certain sequences being totally invariant from mouse to humans. Evidence is presented to show this intergenic sequence serves as a nucleation site for the initiation of diverse genes. We also outline the birth of the human lincRNA gene BCRP3 (BCR activator of RhoGEF and GTPase 3 pseudogene) during primate evolution. The gene developmental process involves sequence initiation, addition of a complex of tandem transposable elements and addition of a segment of another gene. The sequence, initially formed in the Old World Monkeys such as the Rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) and the baboon (Papio anubis), develops into different primate genes before evolving into the human BCRP3 gene; it appears to also include trial and error during sequence/gene formation. The protein gene, GGT5 may have also formed by spacer sequence initiation in an ancient ancestor such as zebrafish, but spacer and GGT5 gene sequence drift during evolution produced a divergence that precludes further assessment.\n\nAuthor summaryFor a number of decades researchers have been interested in how genes evolve and a number of mechanisms of gene formation have been defined. This manuscript describes a different process of gene formation, that of a small DNA sequence that does not code for a gene but serves as a nucleation site for the initiation of de novo gene formation. This non-coding DNA sequence appears to have been in existence for about hundred million years or more and has formed the basis for the birth of diverse genes during evolution of the primates. The questions of how and why new genes are born are important in terms of revealing how organisms, especially primates, progress to greater complexity during evolution; the question of \"how\" is particularly relevant to the creation of biological information ab initio during prebiotic and early cellular evolution.",

    "abstract": "Maintaining stability during perturbed locomotion requires coordinated responses across multiple levels of organization (e.g., legs, joints, muscle-tendon units). However, current approaches to investigating such responses lack a \"common currency\" that is both shared across scales and can be directly related to perturbation demands. We used mechanical energetics to investigate the demands imposed on a leg by a transient increase in unilateral treadmill belt speed targeted to either early or late stance. We collected full body kinematics and kinetics from 7 healthy participants during 222 total perturbations. From across-subject means, we found early stance perturbations elicited no change in net work exchanged between the perturbed leg and the treadmill but net positive work at the overall leg level, and late stance perturbations elicited positive work at the leg/treadmill interface but no change in net work at the overall leg level. Across all perturbations, changes in ankle and knee work from steady state best reflected changes in overall leg work on the perturbed and contralateral sides, respectively. Broadening this paradigm to include joint level (vs. leg level) perturbations and including muscle-tendon unit mechanical energetics may reveal neuromechanical responses used in destabilizing environments which could inform design of balance-assisting devices and interventions.\n\nSubject Areasbiomechanics, biomedical engineering, bioengineering",

    "abstract": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) and epigenetic alterations are characteristics of advanced and metastatic cancers [1-4], yet whether they are mechanistically linked is unknown. Here we show that missegregation of mitotic chromosomes, their sequestration in micronuclei [5, 6], and subsequent micronuclear envelope rupture [7] profoundly disrupt normal histone post-translational modifications (PTMs), a phenomenon conserved across humans and mice as well as cancer and non-transformed cells. Some of the changes to histone PTMs occur due to micronuclear envelope rupture whereas others are inherited from mitotic abnormalities prior to micronucleus formation. Using orthogonal techniques, we show that micronuclei exhibit extensive differences in chromatin accessibility with a strong positional bias between promoters and distal or intergenic regions. Finally, we show that inducing CIN engenders widespread epigenetic dysregulation and that chromosomes which transit in micronuclei experience durable abnormalities in their accessibility long after they have been reincorporated into the primary nucleus. Thus, in addition to genomic copy number alterations, CIN can serve as a vehicle for epigenetic reprogramming and heterogeneity in cancer.",

    "abstract": "SAN failure, aka sick-sinus syndrome, which features sinus bradycardia, SAN impulse pauses, and irregularity of RR interval rhythms are manifestations of SAN cell dysfunction that increases exponentially with advanced age, i.e., SAN frailty. Abnormalities in intrinsic RR interval variability may be the earliest signatures of SAN cell dysfunction leading to SAN frailty in late life. We measured RR interval variability within EKG timeseries prior to and during double autonomic blockade in long-lived C57/BL6 mice at 3 month intervals from 6 months of age until the end of life.\n\nLong-lived mice (those that achieved the median cohort lifespan of 24 months and beyond) displayed relatively minor changes in intrinsic RR interval variability prior to 21 months of age. Between 21 and 30 months of age, marked changes in intrinsic RR interval variability signatures in time, frequency, non-linear, and fragmentation domains result in a marked increase in the mean intrinsic RR interval. The effects of autonomic input partially compensated for the prolongation of the mean RR interval by impacting the age-associated deterioration in the RR interval variability signatures toward a youthful pattern. Cross-sectional analyses of other subsets of mice at ages at or beyond the median life span of our longitudinal cohort demonstrated increased non-cardiac, constitutional, whole body frailty, a decrease in energetic efficiency, and an increase in respiratory exchange ratio. In this context, we interpret the progressive increase in intrinsic RR interval variability beyond 21 months of age to be an indication of heartbeat frailty.",
