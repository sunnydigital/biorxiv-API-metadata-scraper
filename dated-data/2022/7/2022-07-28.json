    "abstract": "Cell-free transcription-translation (TXTL) is an in vitro protein expression platform. In synthetic biology, TXTL is utilized for a variety of technologies, such as genetic circuit construction, metabolic pathway optimization, and building prototypes of synthetic cells. For all these purposes, the ability to precisely control gene expression is essential. Various strategies to control gene expression in TXTL have been developed; however, further advancements on gene-specific and straightforward regulation methods are still demanded. Here, we designed a novel method to control gene expression in TXTL, called a \"silencing oligo.\" The silencing oligo is a short oligonucleotide that binds to the target mRNA. We demonstrated that addition of the silencing oligo inhibits eGFP expression in TXTL in a sequence-dependent manner. We investigated one of the silencing oligos inhibitory mechanisms and confirmed that silencing is associated with RNase H activity in bacterial TXTL reactions. We also engineered a transfection system that can be used in synthetic cells. We screened two dozen different commercially available transfection reagents to identify the one that works most robustly in our system. Finally, we combined the silencing oligo with the transfection technology, demonstrating that we can control the gene expression by transfecting silencing oligo-containing liposomes into the synthetic cells.",

    "abstract": "Engineering immune cells with chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) is a promising technology in cancer immunotherapy. Besides classical cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, innate cell types such as NK cells have also been used to generate CAR-T or CAR-NK cells. Here we devised an approach to program a non-classical cytotoxic T cell subset called Mucosal Associated Invariant T (MAIT) cells into effective CAR-T cells against B cell lymphoma and breast cancer cells. Accordingly, we expressed anti-CD19 and anti-Her2 CARs in activated primary human MAIT cells and CD8+ T cells, expanded them in vitro and compared their cytotoxicity against tumor cell targets. We show upon activation through CARs, CAR-MAIT cells exhibit high levels of cytotoxicity towards target cells, comparable to CD8+ CAR-T cells, but interestingly expressed lower levels of IFN-{gamma} than conventional CAR CD8+ T cells. Additionally, in the presence of vitamin B2 metabolite 5-ARU, which is a conserved compound that activates MAIT cells through MHC-I related (MR1) protein, MAIT cells killed MR1-expressing target breast cancer and B cell lymphoma cell lines in a dose dependent manner. Thus, MAIT cells can be genetically edited as CAR-T cells or mobilized and expanded by MR1 ligands as an off-the-shelf novel approach to cell-based cancer immunotherapy strategies while being comparable to conventional methods in effectivity.\n\nKey PointsO_LIMAIT cells expressing CARs effectively kill CD19 and Her2 expressing targets\nC_LIO_LICAR-MAITs display strong cytotoxicity with lower TNF-{gamma} compared to CD8+ CAR-T cells\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The extraordinary diversity of viruses infecting bacteria and archaea is now primarily studied through metagenomics. While metagenomes enable high-throughput exploration of the viral sequence space, metagenome-derived genomes lack key information compared to isolated viruses, in particular host association. Different computational approaches are available to predict the host(s) of uncultivated viruses based on their genome sequences, but thus far individual approaches are limited either in precision or in recall, i.e. for a number of viruses they yield erroneous predictions or no prediction at all. Here we describe iPHoP, a two-step framework that integrates multiple methods to provide host predictions for a broad range of viruses while retaining a low (<10%) false-discovery rate. Based on a large database of metagenome-derived virus genomes, we illustrate how iPHoP can provide extensive host prediction and guide further characterization of uncultivated viruses. iPHoP is available at https://bitbucket.org/srouxjgi/iphop, through a Bioconda recipe, and a Docker container.",

In this work, we reveal a cell cycle regulator (aCcr1) carrying a ribbon-helix-helix (RHH) domain and ubiquitous in the crenarchaeal order Sulfolobales and their viruses. Overexpression of several aCcr1 members including gp21 of rudivirus SIRV2 and its host homolog SiL_0190 of S. islandicus LAL14/1 results in impairment of cell division, evidenced by growth retardation, cell enlargement and an increase in cellular DNA content. Additionally, both gp21 and SiL_0190 can bind to the motif AGTATTA conserved in the promoter of several genes involved in cell division, DNA replication and cellular metabolism thereby repressing or inducing their transcription. Our results suggest that aCcr1 silences cell division and drives progression to the S-phase in Sulfolobales, a function exploited by viruses to facilitate viral propagation.",

It proceeds through RecA assembly into a dynamic filament on ssDNA, the presynaptic filament, which mediates DNA homology search and ordered DNA strand exchange. Here, we combined structural, single molecule and biochemical approaches to characterize the ATP-dependent assembly mechanism of the presynaptic filament of RecA from Streptococcus pneumoniae (SpRecA), in comparison to the Escherichia coli RecA (EcRecA) paradigm. EcRecA polymerization on ssDNA is assisted by the Single-Stranded DNA Binding (SSB) protein, which unwinds ssDNA secondary structures that block EcRecA nucleofilament growth. We report that neither of the two paralogous pneumococcal SSBs could assist SpRecA polymerization on ssDNA. Instead, we found that the conserved RadA helicase promotes this SpRecA nucleofilamentation in an ATP-dependent manner. This allowed us to solve the atomic structure of such a long native SpRecA nucleopolymer by cryoEM stabilized with ATP{gamma}S. It was found to be equivalent to the crystal structure of the EcRecA filament with a marked difference in how RecA mediates nucleotide orientation in the stretched ssDNA. Then, our results show that SpRecA and EcRecA HR activities are different, in correlation with their distinct ATP-dependent ssDNA binding modes.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances and lower costs in rapid high-throughput sequencing have engendered hope that whole genome sequencing (WGS) might afford complete resistome characterization in clinical bacterial isolates. Despite its potential, several challenges should be addressed before adopting WGS to detect antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes in the clinical laboratory. Here, with three distinct ESKAPE bacteria, we compared different approaches to identify best practices for detection of AMR genes, including: total genomic DNA and plasmid DNA extractions, solo assembly of Illumina short-reads and of ONT long-reads, two hybrid assembly pipelines, and three in silico AMR databases. We also determined the susceptibility of each strain to 21 antimicrobials. We found that all AMR genes detected in pure plasmid DNA were also detectable in total genomic DNA indicating that, at least in these three enterobacterial genera, purification of plasmid DNA was not necessary to detect plasmid-borne AMR genes. We also found that Illumina short-reads used with ONT long-reads in either hybrid or polished assemblies of total genomic DNA enhanced sensitivity and accuracy of AMR gene detection. Phenotypic susceptibility corresponded well with genotypes identified by sequencing, but the three AMR databases differed significantly in distinguishing mobile dedicated AMR genes from non-mobile chromosomal housekeeping genes in which rare spontaneous resistance mutations might occur. This study reveals the need for standardized biochemical and informatic procedures and database resources for consistent, reliable AMR genotyping to take full advantage of WGS to expedite patient treatment and to track AMR genes within the hospital and community.",

Putative virophages infecting algal hosts are classified together with polinton-like viruses, transposable elements widely found in algal genomes, yet the lack of isolated strains raises questions about their existence as independent entities. In this work we isolated and characterized a virophage (PgVV-14T) co-infecting Phaeocystis globosa with the Phaeocystis globosa virus-14T (PgV-14T). PgVV-14T decreases the fitness of its PgV-14T viral host, yet it does not salvage the cellular host population. We found viral-like elements resembling PgVV-14T in Phaeocystis genomes, suggesting that these virophages are capable of integrating to the cellular host genome, bridging the gap between Polinton-like viruses and virophages. This system, with a giant virus, a virophage and endogenous viral elements preying on an algal host, presents an opportunity to gain a better understanding on the evolution of eukaryotes and their viruses.",

    "abstract": "The RNA interference (RNAi) pathway has evolved numerous functionalities in eukaryotes, with many on display in Kingdom Fungi. RNAi can regulate gene expression, facilitate drug resistance, or even be altogether lost to improve growth potential in some fungal pathogens. In the WHO fungal priority pathogen, Aspergillus fumigatus, the RNAi system is known to be intact and functional. To extend our limited understanding of A. fumigatus RNAi, we first investigated the genetic variation in RNAi-associated genes in a collection of 217 environmental and 83 clinical genomes, where we found that RNAi components are conserved even in clinical strains. Using endogenously expressed inverted-repeat transgenes complementary to a conditionally essential gene (pabA) or a nonessential gene (pksP), we determined that a subset of the RNAi componentry is active in inverted-repeat transgene silencing in conidia and mycelium. Analysis of mRNA-seq data from RNAi double-knockout strains linked the A. fumigatus dicer-like enzymes (DclA/B) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RrpA/B) to regulation of conidial ribosome biogenesis genes; however, surprisingly few endogenous small RNAs were identified in conidia that could explain this broad change. Although RNAi was not clearly linked to growth or stress response defects in the RNAi knockouts, serial passaging of RNAi knockout strains for six generations resulted in lineages with diminished spore production over time, indicating that loss of RNAi can exert a fitness cost on the fungus. Cumulatively, A. fumigatus RNAi appears to play an active role in defense against double-stranded RNA species alongside a previously unappreciated housekeeping function in regulation of conidial ribosomal biogenesis genes.",

CPF contains endonuclease, poly(A) polymerase and protein phosphatase activities that cleave and polyadenylate the pre-mRNA, and dephosphorylate Pol II to control transcription. Exactly how the RNA 3'-end processing machinery is coupled to transcription remains unclear. Here, we combine in vitro reconstitution, electron cryo-microscopy and X-ray crystallography to show that CPF physically and functionally interacts with Pol II. Surprisingly, CPF-mediated dephosphorylation promotes the formation of a Pol II stalk-to-stalk homodimer. This dimer is compatible with transcription (unlike other Pol II dimers) but not with the binding of transcription elongation factors. We show that the Ref2 subunit of CPF contributes directly to the interaction with Pol II and also regulates the Glc7/PP1 CPF phosphatase. We hypothesize that Pol II dimerization may play a role in gene looping and may provide a mechanistic basis for the allosteric model of transcription termination.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional gene regulation is accomplished by the interplay of the transcriptome with RNA-binding proteins, which occurs in a dynamic manner in response to altered cellular conditions. Recording the combined occupancy of all proteins binding to the transcriptome offers the opportunity to interrogate if a particular treatment leads to any interaction changes, pointing to sites in RNA that undergo post-transcriptional regulation. Here, we establish a method to monitor protein occupancy in a transcriptome-wide fashion by RNA sequencing. To this end, peptide-enhanced pull-down for RNA sequencing (or PEPseq) uses metabolic RNA labelling with 4-thiouridine (4SU) for light-induced protein-RNA crosslinking, and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) chemistry to isolate protein-crosslinked RNA fragments across all long RNA biotypes. We use PEPseq to investigate changes in protein occupancy during the onset of arsenite-induced translational stress in human cells and reveal evidence for ribosome stalling and depletion from stress granules for a distinct set of mRNAs, many coding for ribosomal proteins. We use quantitative proteomics to demonstrate that translation of these mRNAs remains repressed during the initial hours of recovery after arsenite stress. Thus, we present PEPseq as a discovery platform for the unbiased investigation of post-transcriptional regulation.",

The centromere chromatin similar to the bulk chromatin consist of nucleosomes, but H3 histone of the bulk chromatin nucleosomes (H3 nucleosomes) is replaced with CENP-A histone. Additionally, the centromere comprises tandem repeats of -satellite DNA which CENP-A nucleosomes assemble upon. However, the effect of the DNA sequence on the nucleosome assembly and centromere formation remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the structure of nucleosomes assembled with the CENP-A variant using Atomic Force Microscopy. We assembled both CENP-A nucleosomes and H3 nucleosomes on a DNA substrate containing an -satellite motif and characterized their positioning and wrapping efficiency. We also studied CENP-A nucleosomes on the 601-positioning motif and non-specific DNA to compare their relative positioning and stability. CENP-A nucleosomes assembled on -satellite DNA did not show any positional preference along the substrate, which is similar to H3 nucleosomes and CENP-A nucleosomes on non-specific DNA. The range of nucleosome wrapping efficiency was narrower on -satellite DNA compared with non-specific DNA, suggesting a more stable complex.

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species are ubiquitous in cells, where they damage RNA and protein. While relief mechanisms, including effects on translation, have been described, whether ribosomes are functionally compromised by oxidation, and how this damage is mitigated, remains unknown. Here we show that cysteines in ribosomal proteins, including Rps26, are readily oxidized and rendered non-functional, which is exacerbated when yeast are exposed to H2O2. Oxidized Rps26 is released from ribosomes by its chaperone Tsr2, which allows for repair of the damaged ribosomes with newly made Rps26. Ribosomes containing damaged Rpl10 or Rpl23 are similarly repaired by their chaperones, Sqt1 and Bcp1. Ablation of this pathway impairs growth, which is exacerbated under oxidative stress. These findings reveal a novel mechanism for chaperone-mediated ribosome repair with implications for aging and health.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryChaperones repair thiol-oxidized ribosomes by release of damaged components and incorporation of newly made ribosomal proteins.",

    "abstract": "Members of the insulin superfamily regulate a variety of biological processes through two types of target-specific but structurally conserved peptides, insulin/insulin-like growth factors and relaxin/insulin-like peptides. The latter bind to the human relaxin family peptide receptors (RXFPs), which are class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), to exert pleiotropic actions. Here, we report three cryo-electron microscopy structures of RXFP4-Gi protein complexes in the presence of the endogenous ligand insulin-like peptide 5 (INSL5) or one of the two small molecule agonists, compound 4 and DC591053, both were discovered through medicinal chemistry efforts. The B chain of INSL5 adopts a single -helix that penetrates into the orthostatic pocket, while the A chain sits above the orthosteric pocket to interact with the extracellular surface of RXFP4, revealing a unique peptide-binding mode previously unknown. Together with mutagenesis and functional analyses, the key determinants responsible for the peptidomimetic agonism and subtype selectivity were identified. DC591053 selectively mimicked the action of INSL5 at RXFP4 whereas compound 4 activated both RXFP3 and RXFP4. Comparison of peptide binding modes within the insulin superfamily displayed diverse interaction mechanisms distinct to each type of the peptides. Our findings not only provide valuable insights into ligand recognition and subtype selectivity among class A GPCRs, but also expand the knowledge of signaling mechanisms in the insulin superfamily.",

    "abstract": "Targeted therapies have increased the treatment options for triple-negative breast cancer patients. However, the paucity of targetable biomarkers and tumour heterogeneity have limited the ability of precision-guided interventions to live up to their full potential. As affinity targeting ligands, aptamers show high selectivity towards target molecules. Compared to antibodies, aptamers have lower molecular weight, increased stability during transportation, reduced immunogenicity, and increased tissue uptake. Recently, we reported the discovery of GreenB1 aptamer that is internalized in cultured triple-negative MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. We show that the GreenB1 aptamer specifically targets {beta}1-integrin, a protein previously linked to breast cancer cell invasiveness and migration. Aptamer binds to {beta}1-integrin with low nanomolar affinity. GreenB1 homes in the orthotopic 4T1 triple-negative breast cancer lesions modelled in mice. Our findings suggest potential applications for the GreenB1-guided precision agents for the diagnosis and therapy of triple-negative breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Nanodiscs have become a popular tool in structure determination of membrane proteins using cryogenic electron microscopy and single particle analysis. However, the structure determination of small membrane proteins remains challenging. When the embedded protein is in the same size range as the nanodisc, the nanodisc can significantly contribute to the alignment and classification during the structure determination process. In those cases, it is crucial to minimize the heterogeneity in the nanodisc preparations to assure maximum accuracy in the classification and alignment steps of single particle analysis. Here, we introduce a new in-silico method for the characterization of nanodisc samples that is based on analyzing the Feret diameter distribution of their particle projection as imaged in the electron microscope. We validated the method with comprehensive simulation studies and show that Feret signatures can detect subtle differences in nanodisc morphologies and composition that might otherwise go unnoticed. We used the method to identify a specific biochemical nanodisc preparation with low size variations, allowing us to obtain a structure of the 23-kDa single-span membrane protein Bcl-xL while embedded in a nanodisc. Feret signature analysis can steer experimental data collection strategies, allowing more efficient use of high-end data collection hardware, as well as image analysis investments in studies where nanodiscs significantly contribute to the total volume of the full molecular species.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=88 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/501900v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19ea37aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fed1aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@781962org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ca7859_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LINew methodology to characterize nanodiscs based on Feret signatures\nC_LIO_LIFeret signatures distinguish nanodisc morphologies and compositions\nC_LIO_LIAnalysis is highly sensitive to sample quality\nC_LIO_LIMethod selected condition to solve structure of small membrane protein Bcl-xL\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mosquito-borne diseases are a major global public health concern and mosquito surveillance systems are essential for the implementation of effective mosquito control strategies. The objective of our study is to determine the spatiotemporal distribution of vector mosquito species in Maricopa County, AZ from 2011 to 2021, and to identify the hotspot areas for West Nile virus (WNV) and St. Louis Encephalitis virus (SLEV) transmission in 2021. The Maricopa County Mosquito Control surveillance system utilizes BG-Sentinel and EVS-CDC traps throughout the entire urban and suburban areas of the county. We estimated specific mosquito species relative abundance per unit area using the Kernel density estimator in ArcGIS 10.2. We calculated the distance between all traps in the surveillance system and created a 4 km buffer radius around each trap to calculate the extent to which each trap deviated from the mean number of Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tarsalis collected in 2021. Our results show that vector mosquito species are widely distributed and abundant in the urban areas of Maricopa County. A total of 691,170 Culex quinquefasciatus, 542,733 Culex tarsalis, and 292,305 Aedes aegypti were collected from 2011 to 2022. The relative abundance of Ae. aegypti was highly seasonal peaking in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Culex quinquefasciatus, on the other hand, was abundant throughout the year with several regions consistently yielding high numbers of mosquitoes. Culex tarsalis was abundant but it only reached high numbers in well-defined areas bordering natural and rural areas. We also detected high levels of heterogeneity in the risk of WNV and SLEV transmission to humans disregarding traps geographical proximity. The well-defined species-specific spatiotemporal and geographical patterns found in this study can be used to inform vector control operations.",

    "abstract": "Single particle reconstruction (SPR) in cryoEM is an image processing task with an elaborate hierarchy that starts with a large number of very noisy multi-frame images. Efficient representation of the intermediary image structures is critical for keeping the calculations manageable. One such intermediary structure is called a particle stack and contains cut-out images of particles in square boxes of predefined size. The micrograph that is the source of the boxed images is usually corrected for motion between frames prior to particle stack creation. However, the contrast transfer function (CTF) or its Fourier Transform point spread function (PSF) are not considered at this step. Historically, the particle stack was intended for large particles and for a tighter PSF, which is characteristic of lower resolution data. The field now performs analyses of smaller particles and to higher resolution, and these conditions result in a broader PSF that requires larger padding and slower calculations to integrate information for each particle. Consequently, the approach to handling structures such as the particle stack should be reexamined to optimize data processing.\n\nHere we propose to use as a source image for the particle stack an exit-wave-reconstruction-based image, in which CTF correction is implicitly applied as a real component of the image. The final CTF correction that we later refine and apply has a very narrow PSF, and so cutting out particles from micrographs that were approximately corrected for CTF does not require extended buffering, i.e. the boxes during the analysis only have to be large enough to encompass the particle. The Fourier Transform of an exit-wave reconstruction creates an image that has complex values. This is a complex value image considered in real space, opposed to standard SPR data processing where complex numbers appear only in Fourier space. This extension of the micrograph concept provides multiple advantages because the particle box size can be small while calculations crucial for high resolution reconstruction such as Ewald sphere correction, aberration refinement, and particlespecific defocus refinement can be performed on the small box data.\n\nHighlights{blacksquare} A complex-valued particle stack facilitates flexible and fast data processing\n{blacksquare}A real-valued, compact particle stack can be used at intermediate steps\n{blacksquare}Whole micrograph padding is used from the beginning of data analysis",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsPregnancy induces reprogramming of maternal physiology to support fetal development and growth. Maternal hepatocytes undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia to drive maternal liver growth and alter their gene expression profiles simultaneously. This study aimed to further understand maternal hepatocyte adaptation to pregnancy.\n\nMethodsTimed pregnancies were generated in mice.\n\nResultsIn a non-pregnant state, most hepatocytes expressed Cd133, -fetalprotein (Afp,) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (Epcam) mRNAs, whereas overall, at the protein level, they exhibited a CD133-/AFP- phenotype; however, pericentral hepatocytes were EpCAM+. As pregnancy advanced, while most maternal hepatocytes retained Cd133, Afp, and Epcam mRNA expression, they generally displayed a phenotype of CD133+/AFP+, and EpCAM protein expression was switched from pericentral to periportal maternal hepatocytes. In addition, we found that the Hippo/yes-associated protein (YAP) pathway does not respond to pregnancy. Yap1 gene deletion specifically in maternal hepatocytes did not affect maternal liver growth or metabolic zonation. However, the absence of Yap1 gene eliminated CD133 protein expression without interfering with Cd133 transcript expression in maternal livers.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrated that maternal hepatocytes acquire heterogeneous and dynamic developmental phenotypes, resembling fetal hepatocytes, partially via YAP1 through a post-transcriptional mechanism. Moreover, maternal liver is a new source of AFP. In addition, maternal liver grows and maintains its metabolic zonation independent of the Hippo/YAP1 pathway. Our findings revealed a novel and gestation-dependent phenotypic plasticity in adult hepatocytes.\n\nSynopsisWe found that maternal hepatocytes exhibit developmental phenotypes in a temporal and spatial manner, similarly to fetal hepatocytes.

    "abstract": "Plants involve a fine modulation of pectin methylesterase (PME) activity against microbes. PME activity can promote the cell wall stiffening and the production of damage signals able to induce defense responses. However, to date, the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms triggering PME activity during disease remains largely unknown. In this study, we explored the role of subtilases (SBTs), serine proteases consisting of 56 isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana, as activators of PME activity in plant immunity. By using biochemical and reverse genetic approaches, we found that SBT3.3 and SBT3.5 are required to control PME activity and resistance to the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Arabidopsis sbt3.3 and sbt3.5 knockout mutants showed a reduced induction of PME activity and an increased susceptibility to B. cinerea. SBT3.3 expression is controlled by the damage-associated molecular patterns Oligogalacturonides. The SBT3.3 overexpression overactivates PME activity, but only during fungal infection, resulting in an increased expression of the defense-related genes and in an enhanced resistance to B. cinerea. We revealed that SBT3.3 and the Pro-PME17 isoforms are both secreted in the cell wall exploiting distinct protein secretion pathways and a different kinetic. Our findings point to SBTs as a mechanism to switch on PME activity and the related pectin integrity signaling to strengthen plant immunity against pests, in a timely manner to avoid the growth-defense trade-off.\n\nOne sentence SummarySubtilases arm pectin methylesterase activity against pathogens to switch on pectin integrity signalling, reinforcing plant immunity and avoiding the growth-defense trade-offs",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 envelope (Env), a heterotrimer of gp120-gp41 subunits, mediates fusion of the viral and host cell membranes after interactions with the host receptor CD4 and a coreceptor. CD4 binding induces rearrangements in Env trimer, resulting in a CD4-induced (CD4i) open Env conformation. Structural studies of antibodies isolated from infected donors have defined antibody-Env interactions, with one class of antibodies specifically recognizing the CD4i open Env conformation. Here, we characterize a group of monoclonal antibodies isolated from HIV-1 infected donors (V2i mAbs) that display characteristics of CD4i antibodies. Binding experiments demonstrate that the V2i mAbs preferentially recognize CD4-bound open Env trimers. Structural characterizations of V2i mAb-Env-CD4 trimer complexes using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy show recognition by V2i mAbs using different angles of approach to the gp120 V1V2 domain and the {beta}2/{beta}3 strands on a CD4i open conformation Env with no direct interactions of the mAbs with CD4. We also characterize CG10, a CD4i antibody that was raised in mice immunized with a gp120-CD4 complex, complexed with Env trimer and CD4. CG10 exhibits similar characteristics to the V2i antibodies: i.e., recognition of the open Env conformation, but shows direct contacts to both CD4 and gp120. Structural comparisons of these and previously characterized CD4i antibody interactions with Env provide a suggested mechanism for how these antibodies are elicited during HIV-1 infection.\n\nImportanceThe RV144 HIV-1 clinical vaccination trial showed mild protection against viral infection. Antibody responses to the V1V2 region of HIV-1 Env gp120 were correlated inversely with the risk of infection. In addition, antibodies targeting V1V2 have been correlated with protections from SIV and SHIV infections in non-human primates. We structurally characterized V2i antibodies directed against V1V2 isolated from HIV-1 infected humans in complex with open Env trimers bound to the host receptor CD4. We also characterized a CD4i antibody that interacts with CD4 as well as the gp120 subunit of an open Env trimer. Our study suggests how V2i and CD4i antibodies were elicited during HIV-1 infection.",

    "abstract": "The rice pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae causes severe losses to rice production. Previous studies have shown protein kinase MoCK2 essential for pathogenesis, and this ubiquitous eukaryotic might affect several processes in the fungus needed for infection. To better understand which cellular processes are affected by the MoCK2 activity, we performed a detailed RNAseq analysis of deletions MoCK2-beta1 and beta2 components in relation to the background strain Ku80 and connected this analysis with the abundance of substrates for proteins in a previous pulldown of the essential CKa subunit of CK2 to estimate effects on proteins directly interacting with CK2. The results showed that MoCK2 seriously affected carbohydrate metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, amino acid metabolism and related transporters and reduced acetyl-CoA production. CK2 phosphorylation can affect the folding of proteins and especially the effective formation of protein complexes by intrinsically disordered or mitochondrial import by destabilizing soluble alpha helixes. Upregulated genes found in the pulldown of the b1 and b2 mutants indicate that proteins directly interacting with CK2 are compensatory upregulated depending on their pulldown. A similar correlation was found for mitochondrial proteins. Taken together, the classes of proteins and the change in regulation in the b1 and b2 mutants suggest that CK2 has a central role in mitochondrial metabolism, secondary metabolism, and ROS resistance, in addition to the previously suggested role in the formation of new ribosomes, all processes central to efficient non-self responses as innate immunity.\n\nImportanceThe protein kinase CK2 is highly expressed and essential for plants, animals, and fungi affecting fatty acid-related metabolism. In addition, it directly affects the import of essential mitochondrial proteins into mitochondria. These effects mean CK2 is essential for lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function and, as shown before, crucial for making new translation machinery proteins. Taken together, our new results combined with previous published indicate that CK2 is an essential protein necessary for the capacity to launch efficient innate immunity responses and withstand the negative effect of such responses necessary for general resistance against invading bacteria and viruses as well as to interact with plants and withstand plant immunity responses and kill plant cells.\n\nProtein kinase CK2, highly expressed and essential for plants, animals, and fungi, affects fatty acid-related metabolism and mitochondrial proteins, making it essential for the capacity to launch efficient innate immunity responses and plant pathogenicity",

Here, we examined this during the first hours of Drosophila embryogenesis.

Most newly formed boundaries are occupied by combinations of CTCF, BEAF- 32 and/or CP190. Depleting each insulator from chromatin revealed that TADs can still establish during ZGA, although with lower insulation, with particular boundaries being more sensitive. Some weakened boundaries have aberrant gene expression, however the majority of mis-expressed genes have no obvious relationship to changes in domain-boundary insulation. Deletion of an active promoter (thereby blocking transcription) at one boundary had a greater impact compared to deleting the insulator-bound region itself.

    "abstract": "Identification of Plasmodium-resistance genes in malaria vectors remains an elusive goal despite the recent availability of high-quality genomes of several mosquito vectors. An. stephensi, with its three distinctly-identifiable forms at the egg stage, correlating with varying vector competence, offers an ideal species to discover functional mosquito genes implicated in Plasmodium resistance. Recently, the genomes of several strains of An. stephensi of the type-form, known to display high vectorial capacity, have been reported. Here, we report a chromosomal-level assembly of an intermediate-form of An. stephensi strain (IndInt), shown to have reduced vectorial capacity relative to a strain of type-form (IndCh). The contig level assembly with a L50 of 4 was scaffolded into chromosomes by using the genome of IndCh as the reference. The final assembly shows a heterozygous paracentric inversion, 3Li, involving 8 Mbp, which is syntenic to the extensively-studied 2La inversion implicated in Plasmodium resistance in An. gambiae involving 21 Mbp. Deep annotation of genes within the 3Li region in IndInt assembly using the state-of-the-art protein-fold prediction and other annotation tools reveals the presence of a TNF-like gene, which is the homolog of the eiger gene in Drosophila. Subsequent chromosome-wide searches revealed homologs of wengen (wgn) and grindelwald (grnd) genes in IndInt, which are known to be the receptors for eiger in Drosophila. We have identified all the genes in IndInt required for eiger-mediated signaling by analogy to TNF-TNFR system, suggesting the presence of a functionally active eiger signaling pathway present in IndInt. Comparative genomics of high-quality genome assemblies of the three type-forms with that of IndInt, reveals structurally disruptive mutations in eiger gene in all three strains of the type-form, alluding to compromised innate immunity in the type-form as the cause of high vectorial capacity in these strains. This is the first report of the presence of an intact evolutionarily-conserved TNF-TNFR signaling system in malaria vectors, with a potential role in Plasmodium resistance.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic polymers that undergo stochastic transitions between growing and shrinking phases. The structural and chemical properties of these phases remain poorly understood. The transition from growth to shrinkage, termed catastrophe, is not a first-order reaction but is rather a multi-step process whose frequency increases with the growth time: the microtubule ages as the older microtubule tip becomes more unstable. Aging shows that the growing phase is not a single state but comprises several substates of increasing instability. To investigate whether the shrinking phase is also multi-state, we characterized the kinetics of microtubule shrinkage following catastrophe using an in vitro reconstitution assay with purified tubulins. We found that the shrinkage speed is highly variable across microtubules and that the shrinkage speed of individual microtubules slows down over time by as much as several fold. The shrinkage slowdown was observed in both fluorescently labeled and unlabeled microtubules as well as in microtubules polymerized from tubulin purified from different species, suggesting that the shrinkage slowdown is a general property of microtubules. These results indicate that microtubule shrinkage, like catastrophe, is time-dependent and that the shrinking microtubule tip passes through a succession of states of increasing stability. We hypothesize that the shrinkage slowdown is due to destabilizing events that took place during growth which led to multi-step catastrophe. This suggests that the aging associated with growth is also manifest during shrinkage with the older, more unstable growing tip being associated with a faster depolymerizing shrinking tip.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe dynamics of the microtubule cytoskeleton is crucial for several functions in eukaryotic cells. Microtubule dynamics is traditionally described by constant growth and shrinkage speeds with first order transitions between the growth and shrinkage phases. However, catastrophe, the transition from growth to shrinkage, increases with microtubule age and is not a first order process. In contrast to the common assumption that microtubules shrink with constant speed, here we show that shrinking microtubule tips undergo step-wise slowdown during depolymerization. Our results suggest that microtubule shrinkage, like catastrophe, is a multi-step process. This finding is important for understanding the molecular nature of microtubule dynamic instability and how microtubule shrinkage can be modulated by microtubule associated proteins.",
