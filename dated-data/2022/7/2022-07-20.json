    "abstract": "ADP-heptose activates the protein kinase ALPK1 triggering TIFA phosphorylation at Thr9, the recruitment of TRAF6 and the subsequent production of inflammatory mediators. Here, we demonstrate that ADP-heptose also stimulates the formation of Lys63- and Met1-linked ubiquitin chains to activate the TAK1 and canonical IKK complexes, respectively. We further show that the E3 ligases TRAF6 and c-IAP1 operate redundantly to generate the Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains required for pathway activation, which we demonstrate are attached to TRAF6, TRAF2 and c-IAP1, and that c-IAP1 is recruited to TIFA by TRAF2. ADP-heptose also induces activation of the kinase TBK1 by a TAK1-independent mechanism, which require TRAF2 and TRAF6. We establish that ALPK1 phosphorylates TIFA directly at Thr177 as well as Thr9 in vitro. Thr177 is located within the TRAF6-binding motif and its mutation to Asp prevents TRAF6 but not TRAF2 binding, indicating a role in restricting ADP-heptose signalling. We conclude that ADP-heptose signalling is controlled by the combined actions of TRAF2/c-IAP1 and TRAF6.",

    "abstract": "The genus Girardia (Platyhelminthes: Tricladida) comprises several species of which some have spread from their original areas of distribution in the Americas to other parts of the globe. Due to great anatomical similarities between species, morphology-based phylogenetic analyses struggled to resolve the affinities between species and species-groups. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that populations of Girardia may show only asexual reproduction by fissiparity and, thus, do not exhibit a copulatory apparatus, which hampers taxonomic identification and extraction of phylogenetic characters. In the present work this problem has been resolved by constructing a molecular phylogeny of the genus. Although our samples do not include representatives of all known species, they cover a large part of the original distributional range of the genus Girardia. Our phylogenetic results suggest the presence of two main clades, which are genetically and karyologically highly differentiated. North and South American nominal G. tigrina actually constitute two sibling species that are not even closely related. The South American form is here described as a new species. The phylogenetic tree brings to light that Girardia arose on the South American portion of Gondwanaland, from which it, subsequently, dispersed to the Nearctic Region, probably more than once.",

Here, we implement, evaluate, and provide a digital frailty index composed entirely of computational analyses of home-cage video and compare it to manually obtained frailty scores in genetically diverse mice. We show that the frailty scores assigned by our digital index correlate with both manually obtained frailty scores and chronological age.

    "abstract": "Chronic skin wounds place a high burden on patients and health care systems. The use of angiogenic and mitogenic growth factors (GF) can facilitate the healing but GF are quickly inactivated by the wound environment if added exogenously. Here, free-standing multilayer films (FSF) are fabricated from chitosan (CHI) and alginate (ALG) as opposing polyelectrolytes in an alternating manner using layer-by-layer technique (LbL). One hundred bilayers form an about 450 {micro}m thick, detachable free-standing film (N-FSF) that is subsequently crosslinked by either ethyl (dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) combined with N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) (E-FSF) or genipin (G-FSF). The characterization of swelling, oxygen permeability and crosslinking density shows reduced swelling and oxygen permeability for both crosslinked films compared to N-FSF. Loading of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) into the films results in a sustained release of GF from crosslinked in comparison to N-FSF. Biocompatibility studies in vitro with human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) cultured underneath the films demonstrate increased cell growth and cell migration for all films with and without FGF2. Especially G-FSF loaded with FGF2 greatly increases cell proliferation and migration. In vivo biocompatibility studies by subcutaneous implantation in mice show that E-FSF causes a strong inflammatory response while G-FSF is of high biocompatibility. N-FSF also represents a biocompatible film but shows early degradation. All FSF possess antibacterial properties against gram+ and gram-bacteria demonstrated by an agar diffusion disc assay. In summary, FSF made of ALG and CHI crosslinked with genipin can act as a reservoir for the sustained release of FGF2, possessing high biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, G-FSF promotes growth and migration of HDF and has antibacterial properties which makes it an interesting candidate for bioactive wound dressings.",

    "abstract": "Medial knee contact force (MCF) is related to the pathomechanics of medial knee osteoarthritis. However, MCF cannot be directly measured in the native knee, making it difficult for therapeutic gait modifications to target this metric. Static optimization, a musculoskeletal simulation technique, can estimate MCF, but there has been little work validating its ability to detect changes in MCF induced by gait modifications. In this study, we quantified the error in MCF estimates from static optimization compared to measurements from instrumented knee replacements during normal walking and seven different gait modifications. We then identified minimum magnitudes of simulated MCF changes for which static optimization correctly identified the direction of change at least 70% of the time. A full-body musculoskeletal model with a multi-compartment knee and a custom static optimization implementation was used to estimate MCF. Simulations were evaluated using experimental data from three subjects for a total of 115 steps. Static optimization underpredicted the first peak (mean absolute error = 0.16 bodyweights) and overpredicted the second peak (mean absolute error = 0.31 bodyweights) of MCF. Average root mean square error in MCF over stance phase was 0.32 bodyweights. Static optimization detected the direction of change with at least 70% accuracy for early-stance reductions, late-stance reductions, and early-stance increases in peak MCF of 0.10 bodyweights and greater. These results suggest that a simple static optimization approach accurately detects directional effects on early-stance medial knee loading, potentially making it a valuable tool for evaluating the biomechanical efficacy of gait modifications for knee osteoarthritis.",

However, over time, communication deteriorates, thereby disrupting effective information flow and compromising cellular health. To quantify the age-related loss of molecular communication, we applied information theory to quantify communication efficiency between transcription factors (TF) and corresponding target genes (TGs). Using single cell RNA-seq data from the limb muscle of young, middle-aged, and aged mice, we found that the precision with which TFs regulate TGs diminished with age, but that information transfer was preferentially preserved in a subset of gene pairs associated with homeostasis--a phenomenon we termed \"age-based canalization\". Collectively, these data suggest that aging may be accompanied by a reallocation of resources that favor messages crucial to maintenance of stability and survival.\n\nOne sentence summaryAs communication efficiency in the regulatory network diminishes, aged cells prioritize homeostatic over adaptive functions.",

    "abstract": "The spatial architecture of the tumour microenvironment and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells have been shown to be associated with cancer prognosis and clinical outcomes, including survival. Recent advances in highly multiplexed imaging, including imaging mass cytometry (IMC), capture spatially resolved, high-dimensional maps that quantify dozens of disease-relevant biomarkers at single-cell resolution, that contain potential to inform patient-specific prognosis. However, existing automated methods for predicting survival typically do not leverage spatial phenotype information captured at the single-cell level, and current methods tend to focus on a single modality, such as patient variables (PVs). There is no end-to-end method designed to leverage the rich information in whole IMC images and all marker channels, and aggregate this information with PVs in a complementary manner to predict survival with enhanced accuracy. We introduce a deep multimodal graph-based network (DMGN) that integrates entire IMC images and multiple PVs for end-to-end survival prediction of breast cancer. We propose a multimodal graph-based module that considers relationships between spatial phenotype information in all image regions and all PVs, and scales each region-PV pair based on its relevance to survival. We propose another module to automatically generate embeddings specialised for each PV to enhance multimodal aggregation. We show that our modules are consistently effective at improving survival prediction performance using two public datasets, and that DMGN can be applied to an independent validation dataset across the same antigens but different antibody clones. Our DMGN outperformed state-of-the-art methods at survival prediction.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWRecent advances in single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing have opened a multitude of possibilities to study tissues down to the level of cellular populations. Subsequently, this enabled various scRNA studies that reported novel or previously undetected subpopulations and their functions by integrating multiple datasets. However, the heterogeneity in single-cell sequencing data makes it unfeasible to adequately integrate multiple datasets generated from different studies. This heterogeneity originates from various sources of noise due to technological limitations. Thus, particular procedures are required to adjust such effects prior to further integrative analysis. Over the last years, numerous single-cell data analysis workflows have been introduced, implementing various read-count transformation methods for de-noising and batch correction. A detailed review of recent single-cell studies shows while many analysis procedures employ various preprocessing steps, they often neglect the importance of a well-chosen and optimized data transformation. This fact is particularly alarming since these data transformations can alter data distribution and thus have a crucial impact on subsequent downstream cell clustering results. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of the various data transformation methods on three different public data scenarios and evaluates them with the most commonly used dimensionality reduction and clustering analysis. Additionally, we discuss its implications for the subsequent application of different deep neural network approaches, such as auto encoders and transfer learning. In summary, our benchmark analysis shows that a large portion of batch effects and noise can be mitigated by simple but well-chosen data transformation methods. We conclude that such optimized preprocessing is crucial and should be the baseline for all comparative single-cell sequencing studies, particularely for integrative analysis of multiple data sets.",

Such similarities exist between the dorsal and anal fins of living actinopterygians: (1) both fins differentiate in the same direction [dorsal and anal fin patterning module (DAFPM)], and (2) radials and lepidotrichia differentiate in the same direction [endoskeleton and exoskeleton module (EEM)]. To infer the evolution of these common developmental patternings among osteichthyans, we address (1) the complete description and quantification of the DAFPM and EEM in a living actinopterygian (the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) and (2) the presence of these modules in fossil osteichthyans (coelacanths, lungfishes, porolepiforms and  osteolepiforms). In Oncorhynchus, sequences of skeletal elements are determined based on (1) apparition (radials and lepidotrichia), (2) chondrification (radials), (3) ossification (radials and lepidotrichia), and (4) segmentation plus bifurcation (lepidotrichia). Correlations are then explored between sequences. In fossil osteichthyans, sequences are determined based on (1) ossification (radials and lepidotrichia), (2) segmentation, and (3) bifurcation of lepidotrichia. Segmentation and bifurcation patterns were found crucial for comparisons between living and extinct taxa. Our data suggest that the EEM is plesiomorphic at least for actinopterygians, and the DAFPM is plesiomorphic for osteichthyans, with homoplastic dissociation. Finally, recurrent patterns suggest the presence of a Lepidotrichia Patterning Module (LPM).",

In this study, we performed dose-response analysis across 23 environmental toxicants using eight C. elegans strains representative of species-wide genetic diversity. We observed substantial variation in EC10 estimates and slope parameter estimates of dose-response curves of different strains, demonstrating that genetic background is a significant driver of differential toxicant susceptibility. We also showed that, across all toxicants, at least one C. elegans strain exhibited a significantly different EC10 or slope estimate compared to the reference strain, N2 (PD1074), indicating that population-wide differences among strains are necessary to understand responses to toxicants. Moreover, we quantified the heritability of responses to each toxicant dose and observed a correlation between the dose closest to the species-agnostic EC10 estimate and the dose that exhibited the most heritable response. Taken together, these results provide robust evidence that heritable genetic variation explains differential susceptibility across an array of environmental pollutants and that genetically diverse C. elegans strains should be deployed to aid high-throughput toxicological screening efforts.",

    "abstract": "Frizzleds (FZD1-10) are G protein-coupled receptors containing an extracellular cysteine-rich-domain (CRD) that presents the orthosteric binding site of the 19 mammalian WNTs, the endogenous agonists of FZDs. FZDs signal via a diverse set of effector proteins, of which Dishevelled (DVL1-3) is the most well studied and which acts as a hub for several FZD-mediated signaling pathways. However, the mechanistic details of how FZD-DVL interaction mediate pathway initiation and provide pathway selectivity remain an enigma. Here, we use bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assays employing Venus-tagged DVL2 together with NanoLuciferase-tagged FZD5 to investigate the WNT-3A- and WNT-5A-induced dynamics of the FZD-DVL interaction. Our biophysical assessment suggests that the ligand-induced BRET changes over time originate from conformational dynamics in the FZD5-DVL2 complex rather than recruitment dynamics of DVL2 to FZD5. Thus, we suggest that extracellular agonist and intracellular transducers could cooperate with each other through allosteric interaction with FZDs in a ternary complex reminiscent of that of classical GPCRs.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAnalysis of the interaction of FZD5 and DVL2 uncovers WNT-induced conformational dynamics of a WNT-FZD5-DVL2 complex.",

    "abstract": "Everyday life experiences are composed of sequences of events determined by changes of contexts, layered with more rapidly changing occurrences that unfold within each event. A major challenge of our memory systems is how the brain integrates these occurrences within events while also maintaining their distinct details and avoiding over-integration across different contexts. Here we asked if and how distinct hippocampal subfields come to hierarchically represent both event context and subevents occurrences with learning. Participants learned repeating events, defined as sequences of objects superimposed on shared color frames, while undergoing high-resolution fMRI. Behavioral markers and consequences of event boundaries were evident across all repetitions. After learning, hippocampal CA3 multivoxel activation patterns reflected the event context and the strength of event representations in CA3 correlated with behavioral facilitation during event transitions. In contrast to CA3, dentate gyrus activation patterns became more differentiated through learning, specifically for objects that were close in time and belonged to the same event. This is a form temporal pattern separation that is sensitive to context, to facilitate distinct representations of subevent occurrences. A computational model explained these results by dynamic inhibition in dentate gyrus. We also adopted to fMRI novel similarity measures that are sensitive to the overlap in the population of activated voxels and show that CA3 representations of different contexts, and dentate gyrus distinct item representations, likely result from different populations of voxels. These findings suggest an interplay between the representations of event context that shapes temporal pattern separation in dentate gyrus, and attractor dynamics in CA3. The results advance our knowledge of how the hippocampus represents context and time.",

    "abstract": "Due to postmortem DNA degradation, most ancient genomes sequenced to date have low depth of coverage, preventing the true underlying genotypes from being recovered. Genotype imputation has been put forward to improve genotyping accuracy for low-coverage genomes. However, it is unknown to what extent imputation of ancient genomes produces accurate genotypes and whether imputation introduces bias to downstream analyses. To address these questions, we downsampled 43 ancient genomes, 42 of which are high-coverage (above 10x) and three constitute a trio (mother, father and son), from different times and continents to simulate data with coverage in the range of 0.1x-2.0x and imputed these using state-of-the-art methods and reference panels. We assessed imputation accuracy across ancestries and depths of coverage. We found that ancient and modern DNA imputation accuracies were comparable. We imputed most of the 42 high-coverage genomes downsampled to 1x with low error rates (below 5%) and estimated higher error rates for African genomes, which are underrepresented in the reference panel. We used the ancient trio data to validate imputation and phasing results using an orthogonal approach based on Mendels rules of inheritance. This resulted in imputation and switch error rates of 1.9% and 2.0%, respectively, for 1x genomes. We further compared the results of downstream analyses between imputed and high-coverage genomes, notably principal component analysis (PCA), genetic clustering, and runs of homozygosity (ROH). For these three approaches, we observed similar results between imputed and high-coverage genomes using depths of coverage of at least 0.5x, except for African genomes, for which the decreased imputation accuracy impacted ROH estimates. Altogether, these results suggest that, for most populations and depths of coverage as low as 0.5x, imputation is a reliable method with potential to expand and improve ancient DNA studies.",

We show that these protein-targeted drugs pervasively interact with the human transcriptome and can exert unintended biological effects on RNA function. In addition, we show that many off-target interactions occur at RNA loci associated with protein binding and structural changes, allowing us to generate hypotheses to infer the biological consequences of RNA off-target binding.

    "abstract": "BackgroundHigh-throughput phenotyping platforms allow the study of the form and function of a large number of genotypes subjected to different growing conditions (GxE). A number of image acquisition and processing pipelines have been developed to automate this process, for micro-plots in the field and for individual plants in controlled conditions. Capturing shoot development requires extracting from images both the evolution of the 3D plant architecture as a whole, and a temporal tracking of the growth of its organs.\n\nResultsWe propose PhenoTrack3D, a new pipeline to extract a 3D+t reconstruction of maize at organ level from plant images. It allows the study of plant architecture and individual organ development over time during the entire growth cycle. PhenoTrack3D improves a former method limited to 3D reconstruction at a single time point [Artzet et al., 2019] by (i) a novel stem detection method based on deep-learning and (ii) a new and original multiple sequence alignment method to perform the temporal tracking of ligulated leaves. Our method exploits both the consistent geometry of ligulated leaves over time and the unambiguous topology of the stem axis. Growing leaves are tracked afterwards with a distance-based approach. This pipeline is validated on a challenging dataset of 60 maize hybrids imaged daily from emergence to maturity in the PhenoArch platform (ca. 250,000 images). Stem tip was precisely detected over time (RMSE < 2.1cm). 97.7% and 85.3% of ligulated and growing leaves respectively were assigned to the correct rank after tracking, on 30 plants x 43 dates. The pipeline allowed to extract various development and architecture traits at organ level, with good correlation to manual observations overall, on random subsets of 10 to 355 plants.\n\nConclusionsWe developed a novel phenotyping method based on sequence alignment and deep-learning. It allows to characterise automatically and at a high-throughput the development of maize architecture at organ level. It has been validated for hundreds of plants during the entire development cycle, showing its applicability to the GxE analyses of large maize datasets.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn recent years, a new class of small 21- to 24-nt-(s)RNAs has been discovered from microbial pathogens that interfere with their hosts gene expression during infection, reducing the hosts defence in a process called cross-kingdom RNA interference (ckRNAi). According to this model, microbial sRNAs should exert selection pressure on plants so that gene sequences that reduce complementarity to sRNAs are preferred. In this paper, we test this consequence of the ckRNA model by analyzing changes to target sequences considering codon usage and allele frequencies in the model system Arabidopsis thaliana (At) - Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Ha) and Hordeum vulgare (Hv) - Fusarium graminearum (Fg). In both pathosystems, some selected sRNA and their corresponding target have been described and experimentally validated, while the lengthy methodology prevents the analysis of all discovered sRNAs. To expand the understanding of ckRNAi, we apply a new in silico approach that integrates the majority of sRNAs.\n\nResultsWe calculated the probability (PCHS) that synonymous host plant codons in a predicted sRNA target region would show the same or stronger complementarity as actually observed and compared this probability to sets of virtual analogous sRNAs. For the sets of Ha and Fg sRNAs, there was a significant difference in codon usage in their plant gene target regions (for Ha: PCHS 24.9% lower than in the virtual sets; for Fg: PCHS 19.3% lower than in the virtual sets), but unexpectedly for both sets of microbial sRNA we found a tendency towards codons with an unexpectedly high complementarity. To distinguish between complementarity caused by balancing sRNA-gene coevolution and directional selection we estimated Wrights F-statistic (FST), a measurement of population structure, in which positive deviations from the background indicate directional and negative deviations balancing selection at the respective loci. We found a negative correlation between PCHS and FST (p=0.03) in the At-Ha system indicating deviations from codon usage favoring complementarity are generally directionally selected.\n\nConclusionThe directional selection of complementary codons in host plants suggests an evolutionary pressure to facilitate silencing by exogenous microbial sRNAs, which is not consistent with the anticipated biological role of pathogen sRNAs as exclusively effectors in cross-kingdom RNAi. To resolve this conflict, we propose an extended model in which microbial sRNAs are perceived by plants via RNA interference and, via coevolution, primarily help to fine-tune plant gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The search for genetic regulators of leaf venation patterning started over thirty years ago, primarily focussed on mutant screens in the eudicotyledon Arabidopsis thaliana. Developmental perturbations in either cotyledons or true leaves led to the identification of transcription factors required to elaborate the characteristic reticulated vein network. An ortholog of one of these, the C2H2 Zn finger protein DEFECTIVELY ORGANIZED TRIBUTARIES 5 (AtDOT5), was recently identified through transcriptomics as a candidate regulator of parallel venation in maize leaves. To elucidate how AtDOT5 orthologs regulate vein patterning, we generated three independent loss of function mutations by gene editing in Arabidopsis. Surprisingly, none of them exhibited any obvious phenotypic perturbations. To reconcile our findings with earlier reports, we re-evaluated the original Atdot5-1 and Atdot5-2 alleles. By genome sequencing, we show that reported mutations at the Atdot5-1 locus are actually polymorphisms between Landsberg erecta and Columbia ecotypes, and that other mutations present in the background most likely cause the pleiotropic mutant phenotype observed. We further show that a T-DNA insertion in the Atdot5-2 locus has no impact on leaf venation patterns when segregated from other T-DNA insertions present in the original line. We thus conclude that AtDOT5 plays no role in leaf venation patterning in Arabidopsis.\n\nSignificance statementAn understanding of gene function is often derived on the basis of loss of function mutant phenotypes and thus correct identification of mutated loci is crucial. Through gene editing we reveal previous mis-identification of a causative mutation that led to inappropriate functional assignation for the DEFECTIVELY ORGANIZED TRIBUTARIES 5 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana.",

We found that harvested and commercially valuable species were at significantly greater risk of exposure to hazardous climate conditions than non-harvested species, and emissions mitigation disproportionately reduced their projected exposure risk and cumulative climate risk. Of the 90 fish stocks we evaluated, 41% were at high climate risk, but this proportion dropped to 25% under emissions mitigation.

    "abstract": "The widely overlapping physicochemical properties of lipoproteins (LPs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) represents one of the main obstacles for the isolation and characterization of these pervasive biogenic lipid nanoparticles. We herein present the application of an atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based quantitative morphometry assay to the rapid nanomechanical screening of mixed LPs and EVs samples.\n\nThe method can determine the diameter and the mechanical stiffness of hundreds of individual nanometric objects within few hours. The obtained diameters are in quantitative accord with those measured via cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM); the assignment of a specific nanomechanical readout to each object enables the simultaneous discrimination of co-isolated EVs and LPs even if they have overlapping size distributions. EVs and all classes of LPs are shown to be characterized by specific combinations of diameter and stiffness, thus making it possible to estimate their relative abundance in EV/LP mixed samples in terms of stoichiometric ratio, surface area and volume. As a side finding, we show how the mechanical behaviour of specific LP classes is correlated to distinctive structural features revealed by cryo-EM. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first systematic single-particle mechanical investigation of lipoproteins.\n\nThe described approach is label-free, single-step and relatively quick to perform. Importantly, it can be used to analyze samples which prove very challenging to assess with several established techniques due to ensemble-averaging, low sensibility to small particles, or both, thus providing a very useful tool for quickly assessing the purity of EV/LP isolates including plasma- and serum-derived preparations.",

    "abstract": "The single-step approach has become the most widely-used methodology for genomic evaluations when only a subset of phenotyped individuals in the pedigree are genotyped, where the genotypes for non-genotyped individuals are imputed based on gene contents of genotyped individuals through their pedigree relationships. We proposed a new method named single-step NN-MM to represent the single-step genomic evaluations as mixed effects neural networks of three sequential layers: pedigree, genotypes, and phenotypes, where the gene contents of non-genotyped individuals are sampled based on pedigree, genotypes, and phenotypes. In simulation analysis, the single-step NN-MM had similar or better prediction performance than the conventional single-step approach. In addition to imputation of genotypes using three sources of information including phenotypes, genotypes, and pedigree, single-step NN-MM provides a more flexible framework to allow nonlinear relationships between genotypes and phenotypes, and individuals being genotyped with different SNP panels. The single-step NN-MM has been implemented in a package called \"JWAS\".",

    "abstract": "The rich variety of behaviors observed in animals arises through the complex interplay between sensory processing and motor control [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. To understand these sensorimotor transformations, it is useful to build models that predict not only neural responses to sensory input [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] but also how each neuron causally contributes to behavior [11, 12]. Here we demonstrate a novel modeling approach to identify a one-to-one mapping between internal units in a deep neural network and real neurons by predicting the behavioral changes arising from systematic perturbations of more than a dozen neuron types. A key ingredient we introduce is \"knockout training\", which involves perturbing the network during training to match the perturbations of the real neurons during behavioral experiments. We apply this approach to model the sensorimotor transformation of Drosophila melanogaster males during a complex, visually-guided social behavior [13, 14, 15, 16]. Contrary to prevailing views [17, 18, 19], our model suggests that visual projection neurons at the interface between the eye and brain form a distributed population code that collectively sculpts social behavior. Overall, our framework consolidates behavioral effects elicited from various neural perturbations into a single, unified model, providing a detailed map from stimulus to neuron to behavior.",

Whether these influences reflect active visual processing in human ACs, which drives neuronal firing and concurrent broadband high-frequency activity (BHFA; >70 Hz), or whether they merely modulate sound processing is still debatable. Here, we presented auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli to 16 participants with stereo-EEG depth electrodes implanted near ACs for presurgical monitoring. Anatomically normalized group analyses were facilitated by inverse modeling of intracranial source currents. Cross-correlation and spatiotemporal pattern similarity analyses suggested cross-sensory visual influences, which lagged auditory responses by several tens of milliseconds in ACs. Visual stimuli also modulated the phase of intrinsic low-frequency oscillations and triggered 15-30-Hz event-related desynchronization in ACs. However, BHFA, a putative correlate of neuronal firing, was not significantly increased in ACs after visual stimuli, not even when they coincided with auditory stimuli. Intracranial recordings demonstrate cross-sensory modulations, but no indication of active visual processing in human ACs.",

    "abstract": "Hantaviruses are high-priority emerging pathogens carried by rodents and transmitted to humans by aerosolized excreta or, in rare cases, person-to-person contact. While sporadic in North and South America, many infections occur in Europe and Asia, with mortality ranging from 1 to 40% depending on the hantavirus species. There are currently no FDA-approved vaccines or therapeutics for hantaviruses, and the only treatment for infection is supportive care for respiratory or kidney failure. Additionally, the humoral immune response to hantavirus infection is incompletely understood, especially the location of major antigenic sites on the viral glycoproteins and conserved neutralizing epitopes. Here, we report antigenic mapping and functional characterization for four neutralizing hantavirus antibodies. The broadly neutralizing antibody SNV-53 targets an interface between Gn/Gc, neutralizes through fusion inhibition and cross-protects against the Old World hantavirus species Hantaan virus when administered pre- or post-exposure. Another broad antibody, SNV-24, also neutralizes through fusion inhibition but targets domain I of Gc and demonstrates weak neutralizing activity across hantavirus species. ANDV-specific, neutralizing antibodies (ANDV-5 and ANDV-34) neutralize through attachment blocking and protect against hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) in animals but target two different antigenic faces on the head domain of Gn. Determining the antigenic sites for neutralizing antibodies will contribute to further therapeutic development for hantavirus-related diseases and inform the design of new broadly protective hantavirus vaccines.",

    "abstract": "1.NeuVue is a software platform created for large-scale proofreading of machine segmentation and neural circuit reconstruction in high-resolution electron microscopy connectomics datasets. The NeuVue platform provides a robust web-based interface for proofreaders to collaboratively view, annotate, and edit segmentation and connectivity data. A backend queuing service organizes proofreader tasks into purpose-driven task types and increases proofreader throughput by limiting proofreader actions to simple, atomic operations. A collection of analytical dashboards, data visualization tools, and Application Program Interface (API) capabilities provide stakeholders real-time access to proofreading progress at an individual proofreader level as well as insights on task generation priorities. NeuVue is agnostic to the underlying data being proofread and improves upon the traditional proofreader experience through quality-of-life features that streamline complex editing operations such as splitting and merging objects in dense nanoscale segmentation.\n\nNeuVue heavily leverages cloud resources to enable proofreaders to simultaneously access and edit data on the platform. Production-quality features such as load-balancing, auto-scaling, and pre-deployment testing are all integrated into the platforms cloud architecture. Additionally, NeuVue is powered by well-supported open-source connectomics tools from the community such as Neuroglancer, PyChunkedGraph, and Connectomics Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE). The modular design of NeuVue facilitates easy integration and adoption of useful community tools to allow proofreaders to take advantage of the latest improvements in data visualization, processing, and analysis.\n\nWe demonstrate our framework through proofreading of the mouse visual cortex data generated on the IARPA MICrONS Project. This effort has yielded over 40,000 proofreader edits across the 2 petavoxels of \"Minnie\" neuroimaging data. 44 unique proofreaders of various skill levels have logged a cumulative 3,740 proofreading hours, and we have been able to validate the improved connectivity of thousands of neurons in the volume. With sustained development on the platform, new integrated error detection and error correction capabilities, and continuous improvements to the proofreader model, we believe that the NeuVue framework can enable high-throughput proofreading for large-scale connectomics datasets of the future.",

    "abstract": "Several studies suggest that the menstrual cycle affects emotional processing. However, these results may be biased by including women with premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in the samples. PMS is characterized by negative emotional symptomatology, such as depression and/or anxiety, during the luteal phase. This study aimed to explore the modulation of exogenous attention to emotional facial expressions as a function of the menstrual cycle in women without PMS. For this purpose, 55 women were selected (from an original volunteer sample of 790) according to rigorous exclusion criteria. Happy, angry, and neutral faces were presented as distractors, while both behavioral performance in a perceptual task and event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. This task was applied during both phases of the menstrual cycle (luteal and follicular, counterbalanced), and premenstrual symptomatology was monitored daily. Traditional and Bayesian ANOVAs on behavioral data (reaction times and errors in the task) and ERP indices (P1, N170, N2, and LPP amplitudes) confirmed the expected lack of an interaction of phase and emotion. Taken together, these results indicate that women free of PMS present steady exogenous attention levels to emotionally positive and negative stimuli regardless of the menstrual phase.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent disease impeding vision. More recently, AMD has also been linked to cognitive impairment, such as deficits in language and memory skills. In order to better understand the extent of AMD-related changes in the whole brain structure and connectivity, we have conducted an MRI diffusion acquisition study on 40 participants (20 diagnosed with AMD and 20 controls). These acquisitions were then performed again in a follow up two years later. We developed novel analysis methods for diffusion based tractography and connectomes to better determine which, if any, brain region connections saw the greatest changes between the AMD and the age-matched control groups. Using voxel-based analysis, we identified atrophy in AMD participants in the cuneate gyrus, which has been associated with vision, and the left superior temporal gyrus, which has been associated with language, while later acquisitions compounded this with a deficiency in the bilateral cingulate gyrus, itself linked to higher cognition and memory. These regional atrophy findings support that people with AMD experience widespread neuronal degradation that is not limited to retinal neurons. Regions that saw drastically lowered fractional anisotropy among AMD vs. control included the visual cortex, such as the bilateral occipital lobe and the frontoparietal cortex. Tensor Network Principal Component Analysis (TN-PCA) isolated lingual and temporal connections as important differentiators of AMD connectomes compared to controls, thus supporting our morphometric and texture findings in regions related to vision, but also connectopathies of language and memory brain regions. Bundle based analyses in baseline data revealed that the lingual gyrus had greater spread of tracts overall in the AMD participants, which may be explained by prior reorganization in this area, demonstrating a connection between retinal health and lingual structure. Moreover, we noted group differences in the interhemispheric temporal connections, and lingual cerebellar connections, supporting extensive downstream effects of vision loss. Our bundle-based analyses expand the toolset available for neuroimaging-based phenotyping, and reveal widespread changes in AMD participants beyond brain regions and tractography networks directly involved in vision processing, including those involved in language and memory.",

    "abstract": "Many everyday tasks require us to integrate information from multiple steps to make a decision. Dominant accounts of flexible cognition suggest that we are able to navigate such complex tasks by attending to each step in turn, yet few studies measure how we direct our attention to immediate and future task steps. Here, we used a two-step task to test whether participants are sensitive to information that is currently irrelevant, but will be relevant in a future task step. Participants viewed two displays in sequence, each containing two superimposed moving dot clouds of different colours. Participants attended to one cued target colour in each display and reported the average direction of the two target dot clouds. In a subset of trials, we presented a \"decoy\" distractor: the second target colour appeared as the distractor in the first display. We regressed behavioural responses on the dot clouds motion directions to track how this future-relevant \"decoy\" distractor influenced participants reporting of the average target direction. We compared the influence of decoy distractors to never-relevant, recently relevant, and globally relevant distractor baselines. Across four experiments, we found that responses reflected what was immediately relevant, as well as the broader historical relevance of the distractors. However, relevance for a future task step did not reliably influence attention. We propose that attention in multi-step tasks is shaped by what has been relevant in the current setting, and by the immediate demands of each task step.\n\nPublic SignificanceOur everyday functioning depends on our ability to piece together information to make coherent decisions. Understanding how we efficiently select and integrate goal-relevant information is critical if we wish to anticipate how decision-making can go wrong, whether because of fatigue, mental load, or illness. This study shows that decisions in multi-step tasks reflect two distinct processes: narrow focus on what is relevant in each step, alongside broader awareness of what has been relevant in this setting.",

    "abstract": "Complex bidirectional crosstalk between adipocytes and adipose tissue immune cells plays an important role in regulating adipose function, inflammation, and insulin responsiveness. Adipocytes secrete the pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 in response to both inflammatory and catabolic stimuli. Previous studies suggest that IL-6 secretion from adipocytes in obesity may promote adipose tissue inflammation. Here we investigated catabolic stimulation of adipocyte IL-6 secretion and its impact on adipose tissue immune cells. In obesity, catecholamine resistance reduces cAMP-driven adipocyte IL-6 secretion in response to catabolic signals. By restoring adipocyte catecholamine sensitivity in obese adipocytes, amlexanox stimulates adipocyte-specific IL-6 secretion. Here we report that in this context, adipocyte secreted IL-6 activates local macrophage STAT3 to promote Il4ra expression, thereby sensitizing them to IL-4 signaling, and promoting an anti-inflammatory gene expression pattern. Supporting a paracrine adipocyte to macrophage mechanism, these effects could be recapitulated using adipocyte conditioned media to pretreat bone marrow derived macrophages prior to polarization with IL-4. The effects of IL-6 signaling in the adipose tissue are complex and context specific. These results suggest that cAMP driven IL-6 secretion from adipocytes sensitizes adipose tissue macrophages to IL-4 signaling.",

Here, we show that the movement of mast cells (MCs), leukocytes with important roles during allergies and anaphylaxis, fundamentally differs from this rapid adhesion-free leukocyte migration. We identify a crucial role for integrin-dependent adhesion in controlling slow MC movement, which shapes the positioning and network-like tissue distribution of this long-lived immune cell type. In contrast to other immune and non-immune cells, MCs cannot compensate for the lack of integrin function by switching to another migration mode. Single-cell RNA-sequencing revealed a special role for integrins in defining a mature MC phenotype in the periarteriolar tissue space where several stromal cell types provide an anatomical niche rich in Kit ligand, the major MC growth and survival factor. Collectively, this study highlights substrate-dependent haptokinesis as an important mechanism for MC network formation and the tissue organization of resident immune cells.",

Although the desired outputs are highly structure-dependent, the lack of protein structures often makes structure-free methods rely on protein sequence inputs alone. The scarcity of compound-protein pairs with affinity and contact labels further limits the accuracy and the generalizability of CPAC models.\n\nResultsTo overcome the aforementioned challenges of structure naivety and labelled-data scarcity, we introduce cross-modality and self-supervised learning, respectively, for structure-aware and task-relevant protein embedding. Specifically, protein data are available in both modalities of 1D amino-acid sequences and predicted 2D contact maps, that are separately embedded with recurrent and graph neural networks, respectively, as well as jointly embedded with two cross-modality schemes. Furthermore, both protein modalities are pretrained under various self-supervised learning strategies, by leveraging massive amount of unlabelled protein data. Our results indicate that individual protein modalities differ in their strengths of predicting affinities or contacts. Proper cross-modality protein embedding combined with self-supervised learning improves model generalizability when predicting both affinities and contacts for unseen proteins.\n\nAvailabilityData and source codes are available at https://github.com/Shen-Lab/CPAC.\n\nContactyshen@tamu.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are included.",

XPO1 is overexpressed in various cancers and small inhibitors of nuclear export (SINEs) have been developed to inhibit XPO1. In primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL) and classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL), the XPO1 gene may be mutated on one nucleotide and encodes the mutant XPO1E571K. To understand the impact of mutation on protein function, we studied the response of PMBL and cHL cells to selinexor, a SINE, and ibrutinib, an inhibitor of Bruton tyrosine kinase. XPO1 mutation renders lymphoma cells more sensitive to selinexor due to a faster degradation of mutant XPO1 compared to the wild-type. We further showed that a mistrafficking of p65 (RELA) and p52 (NF{kappa}B2) transcription factors between the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments accounts for the response towards ibrutinib. XPO1 mutation may be envisaged as a biomarker of the response of PMBL and cHL cells and other B-cell hemopathies, to SINEs and drugs that target even indirectly the NF{kappa}B signaling pathway.",

    "abstract": "Use of prescription opioids, particularly oxycodone is an initiating factor driving the current opioid epidemic. There are several challenges with modeling oxycodone abuse. First, prescription opioids including oxycodone are orally self-administered and have different pharmacokinetics and dynamics than morphine or fentanyl which have been more commonly used in rodent research. This oral route of administration determines the pharmacokinetic profile, which then influences the establishment of drug-reinforcement associations in animals. Moreover, the pattern of intake and the environment in which addictive drugs are self-administered are critical determinants of the levels of drug intake, of behavioral sensitization, and of propensity to relapse behavior. These are all important considerations when modeling prescription opioid use, which is characterized by continuous drug access in familiar environments. Thus, to model features of prescription opioid use and the transition to abuse, we designed an oral, homecage-based oxycodone self-administration paradigm. Mice voluntarily self-administer oxycodone in this paradigm without any taste modification such as sweeteners, and the majority exhibit preference for oxycodone, escalation of intake, physical signs of dependence, and reinstatement of seeking after withdrawal. In addition, a subset of animals demonstrate drug taking that is resistant to aversive consequences. This model is therefore translationally relevant and useful for studying the neurobiological substrates of prescription opioid abuse.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAlzheimers disease (AD) is characterized by loss of smell and olfactory system pathology that precedes the diagnosis of dementia. Understanding these early processes can potentially identify diagnostic and therapeutic targets to slow AD progression. Here we analyzed differential gene and protein expression in the olfactory bulb (OB) and olfactory tract (OT) of familial AD (FAD) individuals carrying the autosomal dominant presenilin 1 E280A paisa mutation and age-matched controls.\n\nMethodsFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections containing both the OB and OT from 6 FAD individuals and 6 age-matched controls were obtained. Tissue morphology and composition were characterized by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against the myelin marker proteolipid protein (PLP), amyloid-beta (A{beta}), and microglia/macrophage markers Iba1 and CD68, respectively. OB and OT were analyzed separately by targeted RNA sequencing of the whole human transcriptome (BioSpyder TempO-Seq); ingenuity pathway analysis and R-computational program were used to identify differentially expressed genes and pathways between groups. The nanoString spatial proteomics assay for 88 proteins, including markers for AD and immune responses, was used to complement gene expression findings.\n\nResultsCompared to control OT, FAD OT had significantly increased immunostaining for A{beta} and CD68 in the high and low myelinated regions, as well as increased immunostaining for Iba1 in the high myelinated region only; both control and FAD OT samples had similar total area of high and low myelinated regions. In FAD samples, RNA sequencing showed a transcription profile consistent with: (1) viral infection in the OB; (2) inflammation in the OT that carries information via entorhinal cortex from the OB to hippocampus, a brain region essential for learning and memory; and (3) decreased oligodendrocyte deconvolved transcripts, indicating dysregulation of myelination. Interestingly, spatial proteomic analysis confirmed altered myelination in the OT of FAD individuals, implying dysfunction of communication between the OB and hippocampus.\n\nConclusionsThese findings raise the possibility that viral infection and associated inflammation and dysregulation of myelination of the olfactory system may disrupt downstream hippocampal function, contributing to acceleration of FAD progression.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning (ML) is increasingly used in cognitive, computational and clinical neuroscience. The reliable and efficient application of ML requires a sound understanding of its subtleties and limitations. Training ML models on datasets with imbalanced classes is a particularly common problem, and it can have severe consequences if not adequately addressed. With the neuroscience ML user in mind, this paper provides a didactic assessment of the class imbalance problem and illustrates its impact through systematic manipulation of data imbalance ratios in (i) simulated data and (ii) brain data recorded with electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). Our results illustrate how the widely-used Accuracy (Acc) metric, which measures the overall proportion of successful predictions, yields misleadingly high performances, as class imbalance increases. Because Acc weights the per-class ratios of correct predictions proportionally to class size, it largely disregards the performance on the minority class. A binary classification model that learns to systematically vote for the majority class will yield an artificially high decoding accuracy that directly reflects the imbalance between the two classes, rather than any genuine generalizable ability to discriminate between them. We show that other evaluation metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC), and the less common Balanced Accuracy (BAcc) metric - defined as the arithmetic mean between sensitivity and specificity, provide more reliable performance evaluations for imbalanced data. Our findings also highlight the robustness of Random Forest (RF), and the benefits of using stratified cross-validation and hyperprameter optimization to tackle data imbalance. Critically, for neuroscience ML applications that seek to minimize overall classification error, we recommend the routine use of BAcc, which in the specific case of balanced data is equivalent to using standard Acc, and readily extends to multi-class settings. Importantly, we present a list of recommendations for dealing with imbalanced data, as well as open-source code to allow the neuroscience community to replicate and extend our observations and explore alternative approaches to coping with imbalanced data.",

    "abstract": "Cortical function emerges from the interactions of multi-scale networks that may be studied at a high level using neural mass models (NMM), representing the mean activity of large numbers of neurons. In order to properly reproduce experimental data, these models require the addition of further elements. Here we provide a framework integrating conduction physics that can be used to simulate cortical electrophysiology measurements, particularly those obtained from multi-contact laminar electrodes. This is achieved by endowing NMMs with basic physical properties, such as the average laminar location of the apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cell populations. We call this framework laminar NMM, or LaNMM for short. We then employ this framework to infer the location of oscillatory generators from laminar-resolved data collected from the prefrontal cortex in the macaque monkey. Based on the literature on columnar connectivity, we define a minimal neural mass model capable of generating amplitude and phase coupled slow (alpha/beta, 4-22 Hz) and fast (gamma, 30-250 Hz) oscillations. The synapse layer locations of the two pyramidal cell populations are treated as optimization parameters, together with two more LaNMM-specific parameters, to compare the models with the multi-contact recordings. We rank the candidate models using an optimization function that evaluates the match between the functional connectivity (FC) of the model and data, where the FC is defined by the covariance between bipolar voltage measurements at different cortical depths. The family of best solutions reproduces the FC of the observed electrophysiology while selecting locations of pyramidal cells and their synapses that result in the generation of fast activity at superficial layers and slow activity across most depths, in line with recent literature proposals.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe provide a neural mass modeling formalism that includes a physical layer to simulate electrophysiology measurements.\nC_LIO_LITo analyze in-vivo data collected in the macaque monkey during a memory task, we propose a specific model with two coupled main circuits that can generate realistic electrophysiological signals in two important oscillatory regimes--the alpha/beta and the gamma bands.\nC_LIO_LIPhysical elements in the model shed light on the generation of oscillations in the two regimes and on the relative power distribution of fast and slow oscillatory signals across cortical depth, which we show can be altered by the choice of the reference location or method.\nC_LIO_LIThe model is contrasted with in-vivo data, with parameters adjusted by matching voltage statistics in the alpha/beta and gamma bands, leading to a solution with slow frequency components generated by synapses spanning most cortical layers and fast oscillations in superficial layers.\nC_LIO_LIThe resulting formalism provides useful tools and concepts to analyze and model data, with implications for understanding altered oscillatory EEG activity in dementia, Alzheimers disease and other disorders with oscillatory features.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Post-learning sleep contributes to memory consolidation. Yet, it remains contentious whether sleep affords opportunities to modify or update emotional memories, such as those people would prefer to forget. Here we attempted to update memories during sleep using spoken positive emotional words paired with cues to recent memories for aversive events. Affect updating using positive words during human non-rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, compared with using neutral words instead, reduced negative affect judgments in post-sleep tests, suggesting that the recalled events were perceived as less aversive. EEG analyses showed that emotional words modulated theta and spindle/sigma activity. Specifically, to the extent that theta power was larger for the positive word than for the following memory cue, participants judged the memory cues less negatively. Moreover, to the extent that sigma power was larger for the emotional word than for the following memory cue, participants showed higher forgetting of unwanted memories. Notably, when the onset of individual positive word coincided with the upstate of slow oscillations, a state characterized by increased cortical excitability during NREM sleep, affective updating was more successful. In sum, the affect content of memories was altered via strategic spoken words presentations during sleep, in association with theta power increases and slow-oscillation upstates. These findings offer novel possibilities for modifying unwanted memories during sleep, without requiring conscious confrontations with aversive memories that people would prefer to avoid.",

    "abstract": "Germinal centre (GC) B cells undergo proliferation at very high rates in a hypoxic microenvironment, but the cellular processes driving this are incompletely understood. Here we show that the mitochondria of GC B cells are highly dynamic, with significantly upregulated transcription and translation rates associated with the activity of transcription factor mitochondrial A (TFAM). TFAM, whilst also necessary for normal B cell development, is required for entry of activated GC-precursor B cells into the germinal centre reaction, and deletion of Tfam significantly impairs GC formation, function, and output. Loss of TFAM in B cells compromises the actin cytoskeleton and impairs cellular motility of GC B cells in response to chemokine signalling, leading to their spatial disorganisation. We show that B cell lymphoma substantially increases mitochondrial translation, and deletion of Tfam in B cells is protective against the development of lymphoma in a c-Myc transgenic model. Finally, we show that pharmacologic inhibition of mitochondrial transcription and translation inhibits growth of GC-derived human lymphoma cells, and induces similar defects in the actin cytoskeleton.",

    "abstract": "West Nile virus (WNV) and Usutu virus (USUV) are mosquito-borne flaviviruses causing world-wide numerous cases in animals and humans. In Italy, both viruses have been associated with neurological diseases in humans and wild birds. Wild bird rescue centers where support in emergency and care of diseased animals are provided, are potential significant hot spots for avian infection surveillance, as recognized in the Italian Integrate National Surveillance Plan for Arboviruses. Here we report the results of a post-mortem active monitoring study conducted from November 2017 to October 2020 on animals hosted in five wild bird rescue centers of Central Italy. Five hundred seventy-six (n = 576) wild birds were tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence of WNV or USUV RNA fragments. No birds tested positive for USUV RNA (n = 0; 0.00 %). Evidence of WNV RNA (Ct value = 34.36) was found in one bird (n = 1; 0.17 %), an adult little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis subsp. ruficollis), that tested WNV positive on December 2019 and died due to traumatic injuries. The main pathological findings consisted in mild CD3+ lymphocytic tubulo-interstitial nephritis, meningoencephalitis, and cardiomyocytes loss and interstitial oedema of the heart. This study highlights the strategic role of wildlife rescue centers in monitoring both the introduction and circulation of avian emerging zoonotic diseases. Also, the presence of WNV during the cold season evidences the possible role of birds in overwintering mechanisms in the Italian territory and requires further investigations.",

    "abstract": "As a spatial subsidy, which is the phenomenon of transferring resources from a donor system to a recipient system, anadromous salmonids contribute to the supply of marine-derived nutrients to freshwater and terrestrial systems. Live salmon and salmon carcasses and eggs are utilized by various organisms and affect their abundance and distribution. However, the evaluation of the effect of salmon subsidies on the abundance and distribution of terrestrial animals is biased towards predators or scavengers that utilize spawning adults and carcasses, and few studies have focused on the effect of salmon eggs as a subsidy. To avoid underestimating the function of salmon subsidies, the response to the availability of salmon eggs in various systems should be investigated. Here, we investigated the abundance and feeding behaviour of the brown dipper Cinclus pallasii, as salmon egg a consumer, based on the hypothesis that the availability of salmon eggs affects the diet composition and stream distribution of this small predator. In addition, to test whether changes in the abundance of brown dippers are determined by salmon spawning, their abundance was compared upstream and downstream of the dam. Brown dippers used salmon eggs during the spawning season (53.7% of diet composition), and their abundance increased as the number of spawning redds increased. In contrast, this pattern was not observed upstream of the dam. These results suggested that the abundance and stream distribution of brown dippers vary according to the variation in the spatiotemporal availability of salmon eggs.",

The PGCs in C. elegans are embedded in a somatic niche that regulates its DNA damage response (DDR). Here, we show that the AMPK-like kinases KIN-29 and AAK-2 are required for arresting PGCs carrying persistent DNA damage. We determined that the ASI neurons, which sense environmental conditions such as nutrient availability, secrete the TGF-beta-like ligand DAF-7 that is recognized by the DAF-1 receptor in PGCs. ASI-dependent DAF-7 signaling regulates the induction of CEP-1/p53 in the PGCs amid persistent DNA damage. Using single worm whole genome sequencing, we establish that defective ASI control of the CEP-1/p53-regulated DDR in PGCs ultimately results in the inheritance of de novo germline mutations. Our results indicate that sensory neurons safeguard from the inheritance of germline mutations suggesting the possibility that perception of the environment could direct genetic inheritance.\n\nOne sentence summaryThe ASI sensory neurons regulate the CEP-1/p53-dependent DNA damage response of primordial germ cells via TGF-beta signaling and influence inherited mutational burden.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and colocalization analysis are complementary integrative genetic association approaches routinely used to identify functional units underlying complex traits in post-genome-wide association study (post-GWAS) analyses. Recent studies suggest that both approaches are individually imperfect, but joint usage can yield robust and powerful inference results. This paper introduces a new statistical framework, INTACT, to perform probabilistic integration of TWAS and colocalization evidence for implicating putative causal genes. This procedure is flexible and can work with a wide range of existing TWAS and colocalization approaches. It has the unique ability to quantify the uncertainty of implicated genes, enabling rigorous control of false-positive discoveries. Taking advantage of this highly-desirable feature, we describe an efficient algorithm, INTACT-GSE, for gene set enrichment analysis based on the integrated TWAS and colocalization analysis results. We examine the proposed computational methods and illustrate their improved performance over the existing approaches through simulation studies. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to the GTEx data and a variety of GWAS summary statistics derived from complex and molecular traits previously analyzed by Hukku et al. and Sinnott-Armstrong et al. We find empirical evidence that the proposed methods improve and complement existing putative gene implication methods and are advantageous in evaluating and identifying key gene sets and biological pathways.",

    "abstract": "To understand mechanisms and identify potential targets for intervention in the current crisis of opioid use disorder (OUD), postmortem brains represent an under-utilized resource. To refine previously reported gene signatures of neurobiological alterations in OUD from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 9, BA9), we explored the role of microRNAs (miRNA) as powerful epigenetic regulators of gene function. Building on the growing appreciation that miRNAs can cross the blood-brain barrier, we carried out miRNA profiling in same-subject postmortem samples from BA9 and blood tissues. miRNA-mRNA network analysis showed that even though miRNAs identified in BA9 and blood were fairly distinct, their target genes and corresponding enriched pathways were highly overlapping, with tube development and morphogenesis, and pathways related to endothelial cell function and vascular organization, among the dominant enriched biological processes. These findings point to robust, redundant, and systemic opioid-induced miRNA dysregulation with potential functional impact on transcriptomic changes. Further, using correlation network analysis we identified cell-type specific miRNA targets, specifically in astrocytes, neurons, and endothelial cells, associated with OUD transcriptomic dysregulation. Our refined miRNA-mRNA networks enabled identification of novel pharmaco-chemical interventions for OUD, particularly targeting the TGF beta-p38MAPK signaling pathway. Finally, leveraging a collection of control brain transcriptomes from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project, we identified correlation of OUD miRNA targets with TGF beta, hypoxia, angiogenesis, coagulation, immune system and inflammatory pathways. These findings support previous reports of neurovascular and immune system alterations as a consequence of opioid abuse.",

However, there isnt any systematic research to characterize aberrant R-loops at the whole genome level at a large scale. Here, we identified aberrant R-loops, including proliferative and suppressive R-loops of 5 end, body, 3 end respectively for the first time, which are found prevalent and vary across diverse physiological conditions. After that, we proposed a deep neural network-based framework, named Deep R-looper Discriminant to identify aberrant R-loops against housekeeping R-loops. To evaluate the predictive performance of the deep learning framework, we constructed multiple prediction models as benchmarks and it showed our framework achieves robust performance for identifying aberrant R-loops against those normal R-loops. Furthermore, we found the customized Deep R-looper Discriminant was capable of distinguishing between proliferative and suppressive R-loops at 5 end, body, 3 end respectively, outperforming baselines. When inspecting the contribution of epigenetic marks to aberrant R-loops of each class, we inferred landmark epigenetic modifications which play a crucial role in the differentiated formation of those aberrant R-loops, and cell line specificity of epigenetic marks map was found as well. To explore the characteristics of these aberrant R-loops, we depicted the histone landscapes for aberrant R-loops. Finally, we integrated omics and identified target genes regulated directly by aberrant R-loops and found key transcription factors involved in R-loop regulation, which may be implicated in conferring cell-specificity and cancer development and progression.",

    "abstract": "MotivationGene regulatory network (GRN) reconstruction from gene expression profiles is a compute- and data-intensive problem. Numerous methods based on diverse approaches including mutual information, random forests, Bayesian networks, correlation measures, as well as their transforms and filters such as data processing inequality, have been proposed. However, an effective GRN reconstruction method that performs well in all three aspects of computational efficiency, data size scalability, and output quality remains elusive. Simple techniques such as Pearson correlation are fast to compute but ignore indirect interactions, while more robust methods such as Bayesian networks are prohibitively time consuming to apply to tens of thousands of genes.\n\nResultsWe developed MCP Score, a novel maximum-capacity-path based metric to quantify the relative strengths of direct and indirect gene-gene interactions. We further present MCPNet, an efficient, parallelized GRN reconstruction software based on MCP Score, to reconstruct networks in unsupervised and semi-supervised manners. Using synthetic and real S. cervisiae datasets as well as real A. thaliana datasets, we demonstrate that MCPNet produces better quality networks as measured by AUPR, is significantly faster than all other GRN inference software, and also scales well to tens of thousands of genes and hundreds of CPU cores. Thus, MCPNet represents a new GRN inferencing tool that simultaneously achieves quality, performance, and scalability requirements.\n\nAvailabilitySource code freely available for download at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6499748 and https://github.com/AluruLab/MCPNet, implemented in C++ and supported on Linux.\n\nContactaluru@cc.gatech.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

The telecentric DHM (TDHM) is a configuration of DHM that lightens the computation load with a priori aberration corrections. However, TDHM requires a well-aligned optical pipeline to optimize its resolution and image quality (IQ), which has traditionally complicated the alignment process. Further deriving from the optical interference functions, we offer a set of methodologies to simplify TDHM design and alignment by determining the optimal +1 order position, which depends on the object-reference beam angle and the interference plane rotation angle. The methods are then experimentally tested and verified on a TDHM system by imaging living HeLa cells in suspension.",

    "abstract": "Studies focused solely on single organisms can fail to identify the networks underlying host-pathogen gene-for-gene interactions. Here, we integrate genetic analyses of rice (Oryza sativa, host) and rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe oryzae, pathogen) and uncover a new pathogen recognition specificity of the rice nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) immune receptor Pik, which mediates resistance to M. oryzae expressing the avirulence effector gene AVR-Pik. Rice Piks-1, encoded by an allele of Pik-1, recognizes a previously unidentified effector encoded by the M. oryzae avirulence gene AVR-Mgk1, which is found on a mini-chromosome. AVR-Mgk1 has no sequence similarity to known AVR-Pik effectors, and is prone to deletion from the mini-chromosome mediated by repeated Inago2 retrotransposon sequences. AVR-Mgk1 is detected by Piks-1 and by other Pik-1 alleles known to recognize AVR-Pik effectors; recognition is mediated by AVR-Mgk1 binding to the integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain of Piks-1 and other Pik-1 alleles. Our findings highlight how complex gene-for-gene interaction networks can be disentangled by applying forward genetics approaches simultaneously to the host and pathogen. We demonstrate dynamic co-evolution between an NLR integrated domain and multiple families of effector proteins.",

    "abstract": "Arms race co-evolution of plant-pathogen interactions evolved sophisticated recognition mechanisms between host immune receptors and pathogen effectors. Different allelic haplotypes of an immune receptor in host mount distinct recognition against sequence or non-sequence related effectors in pathogens. We report the molecular characterization of the Piks allele of the rice immune receptor Pik against rice blast pathogen, which requires two head-to-head arrayed nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat proteins. Like other Pik genes, both Piks-1 and Piks-2 are necessary and sufficient for Piks-mediated resistance. However, unlike other Pik alleles, Piks does not recognize any known AvrPik variants of M. oryzae. Sequence analysis of the genome of an avirulent isolate V86010 further revealed that its cognate avirulence (Avr) gene most likely has no significant sequence similarity to known AvrPik variants. We conclude that Piks breaks the canonical Pik/AvrPik recognition pattern. Piks-1 and Pikm-1 have only two amino acid differences within the integrated heavy metal-associated (HMA) domain. Pikm-1-HMA interact with AvrPik-A, -D and -E in vitro and in vivo, whereas Piks-1-HMA does not bind any AvrPik variants. Reciprocal exchanges of single amino acid residues between Piks-1 and Pikm-1 further reveal a dynamic recognition mechanism between Piks/Pikm alleles and their respective effectors. Piks-1E229Q/Pikm-1V261A can only activate immunity to AvrPik-D but not to other effectors, indicating that the amino acid change of E to Q at position 229 leads to its gain of a partial recognition spectrum of Pikm. By contrast, Piks-1A261V/Pikm-1Q229E confers immunity to the Piks cognate effector, indicating that the amino acid change of Q to E at position 229 leads to its shifts of the recognition from Pikm to Piks. Intriguingly, binding activities in both Y2H and analytical gel filtration assays are illustrated between Piks-1A261V/Pikm-1Q229E and AvrPik-D. However, it is unable to mount immunity against AvrPik-D, suggesting that biochemical activities based on in vitro and in vivo assays could be insufficient for sustaining biological function of receptor and effector pairs.",

    "abstract": "The NPR proteins function as salicylic acid (SA) receptors in Arabidopsis thaliana. AtNPR1 plays a central role in SA-induced transcriptional reprogramming whereby positively regulates SA-mediated defense. NPRs are found in the genomes of nearly all land plants. However, we know little about the molecular functions and physiological roles of NPRs in most plant species. Our phylogenetic and alignment analyses show that Brassicaceae NPR1-like proteins have characteristically gained or lost functional residues or motifs identified in AtNPRs, pointing to the possibility of a unique evolutionary trajectory for the Brassicaceae NPR1-like proteins that has resulted in peculiar functions. In line with this observation, we find that the only NPR in Marchantia polymorpha, MpNPR, is not the master regulator of SA-induced transcriptional reprogramming and negatively regulates bacterial resistance in this species. Interspecies complementation analysis indicated that the molecular properties of AtNPR1 and MpNPR are partially conserved, implying the diversification of NPR-associated pathways contributed to distinct roles of NPR in different species. The Mpnpr transcriptome suggested potential roles of MpNPR in heat and far-red light responses. We identify both Mpnpr and Atnpr1-1 display enhanced thermomorphogenesis. NPRs and NPR-associated pathways clearly have evolved distinctively in diverged land plant lineages to cope with different terrestrial environments.",

We also identify seven major classes of four-node circuits from clustering analysis of state distributions.

    "abstract": "Open-source, publicly available neuroimaging datasets--whether from large-scale data collection efforts or pooled from multiple smaller studies--offer unprecedented sample sizes and promote generalization efforts. Releasing data can democratize science, increase the replicability of findings, and lead to discoveries. Due to patient privacy and data storage concerns, researchers typically release preprocessed data with the voxelwise time series parcellated into a map of predefined regions, known as an atlas. However, releasing preprocessed data also limits the choices available to the end-user. This is especially true for connectomics, as connectomes created from different atlases are not directly comparable. Since there exist several atlases with no gold standards, it is unrealistic to have processed, open-source data available from all atlases. Together, these limitations directly inhibit the potential benefits of open-source neuroimaging data. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross Atlas Remapping via Optimal Transport (CAROT) to find a mapping between two atlases. This approach allows data processed from one atlas to be directly transformed into a connectome based on another atlas without the need for raw data access. To validate CAROT, we compare reconstructed connectomes against their original counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas), demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes in downstream analyses, and show how a connectome-based predictive model can generalize to publicly available data that was processed with different atlases. Overall, CAROT can reconstruct connectomes from an extensive set of atlases--without ever needing the raw data--allowing already processed connectomes to be easily reused in a wide range of analyses while eliminating redundant processing efforts. We share this tool as both source code and as a stand-alone web application (http://carotproject.com/).",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveWe provide a systematic framework for quantifying the effect of externally applied weak electric fields on realistic neuron compartment models as captured by physiologically relevant quantities such as the membrane potential or transmembrane current as a function of the orientation of the field.\n\nApproachWe define a response function as the steady-state change of the membrane potential induced by a canonical external field of 1 V/m as a function of its orientation. We estimate the function values through simulations employing reconstructions of the rat somatosensory cortex from the Blue Brain Project. The response of different cell types is simulated using the NEURON simulation environment. We represent and analyze the angular response as an expansion in spherical harmonics.\n\nMain resultsWe report membrane perturbation values comparable to those in the literature, extend them to different cell types, and provide their profiles as spherical harmonic coefficients. We show that at rest, responses are dominated by their dipole terms ({ell} = 1), in agreement with experimental findings and compartment theory. Indeed, we show analytically that for a passive cell, only the dipole term is nonzero. However, while minor, other terms are relevant for states different from resting. In particular, we show how{ell} = 0 and{ell} = 2 terms can modify the function to induce asymmetries in the response.\n\nSignificanceThis work provides a practical framework for the representation of the effects of weak electric fields on different neuron types and their main regions--an important milestone for developing micro- and mesoscale models and optimizing brain stimulation solutions.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder with no effective cure. Cerebrovascular and neurovascular pathology are early and causal hallmarks of AD, where cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), the deposition of amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) at the cerebral vasculature, is present in about 90% of cases. Our previous work has uncovered the protective effect of carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition against A{beta}-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and apoptosis in vascular, glial and neuronal cells in culture. Here, we tested for the first time in a transgenic model of AD and cerebrovascular amyloidosis, the TgSwDI mice, a therapeutic regimen employing the FDA-approved CA inhibitors (CAIs), methazolamide (MTZ) and acetazolamide (ATZ). These drugs are used in humans for glaucoma, high altitude sickness, and other disorders, and can cross the blood-brain barrier. We found that both CAIs were non- toxic, significantly reduced cerebral amyloidosis, vascular, microglial and astrocytic A{beta} accumulation, and ameliorated cognition. MTZ and ATZ treatment prevented caspase-3 activation in endothelial cells, microglia and astrocytes, reverted capillary constriction and microhemorrhages, reduced gliosis, and induced glial pro-clearance pathways, which are likely responsible for the reduction of A{beta} deposition. Notably, we unveiled a critical new druggable target, revealing that the mitochondrial isozyme CA-VB is specifically upregulated in TgSwDI mouse brains, as well as in human brains of CAA and AD (with CAA) patients. Importantly, A{beta} challenge induced CA-VB overexpression in human cerebral endothelial cells, and CA-VB silencing, mimicking CAIs effects, reduced A{beta}-mediated endothelial apoptosis. This work paves the way for the application of CAIs in clinical trials for AD and CAA and uncovers CA-VB as a mediator of cerebral amyloid toxicity.",

    "abstract": "The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a hub for cognitive control, and dopamine profoundly influences its functions. In other brain regions, astrocytes sense diverse neurotransmitters and neuromodulators and, in turn, orchestrate regulation of neuroactive substances. However, basic physiology of PFC astrocytes, including which neuromodulatory signals they respond to and how they contribute to PFC function, is lacking. Here, we characterize divergent signaling signatures in astrocytes of PFC and primary sensory cortex in mice, which are linked to differential responsivity to locomotion. We find that PFC astrocytes express receptors for dopamine, but are unresponsive through the Gs/Gi-cAMP pathway. Instead, fast calcium signals in PFC astrocytes are time-locked to dopamine release, and are mediated by 1-adrenergic receptors both ex vivo and in vivo. Further, we describe dopamine-triggered regulation of extracellular ATP at PFC astrocyte territories. Thus, we identify astrocytes as active players in dopaminergic signaling in PFC, contributing to PFC function though neuromodulator receptor crosstalk.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=195 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500710v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (55K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e71858org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ef506forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89e4edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11483e1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, while functional diversity among PVT circuits has often been linked to cellular differences, the molecular identity and spatial distribution of PVT cell types remains unclear. To address this gap, here we used single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and identified five molecularly distinct PVT neuronal subtypes. Additionally, multiplex fluorescent in situ hybridization of top marker genes revealed that PVT subtypes are organized by a combination of previously unidentified molecular gradients. Lastly, comparing our dataset with a recently published single-cell sequencing atlas of thalamus yielded novel insight into the PVTs connectivity with cortex, including unexpected innervation of auditory and visual areas. This comparison also revealed that our data contains a largely non-overlapping transcriptomic map of multiple midline thalamic nuclei. Collectively, our findings uncover previously unknown features of the molecular diversity and anatomical organization of the PVT and provide a valuable resource for future investigations.",

    "abstract": "The blockade of the immune checkpoints PD-1 and CTLA-4 enhances T cell response. However, it is largely unknown how antigen-reactive T cells regulate their checkpoint expression in vivo and whether and how the checkpoint blockade can change activation dynamics of tumour-reactive T cells. To address this, here we used Nr4a3-Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity (Tocky), which allows analysis of temporal changes of activated T cells following TCR signalling in vivo. By analysing melanoma-bearing Nr4a3 Tocky mice, we elucidate hidden dynamics of tumour-reactive T cells in the steady-state. Checkpoint blockade depleted highly activated effector Treg, while promoting unique effector T cell populations, and thus differentially modulating activation of tumour-reactive T cell populations. Furthermore, multidimensional analysis and seamless analysis of Tocky and scRNA-seq revealed a full spectrum of T cell dynamics in response to tumour burden and treatment with checkpoint blockade. Lastly, we propose a rational design of combinatorial therapy to further enhance T cell activities.",

    "abstract": "Dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae are crucial photosymbionts in corals and other marine organisms. Of these algae, Cladocopium goreaui is one of the most dominant symbiont species in the Indo-Pacific. Here, we present an improved genome assembly of C. goreaui combining new long-read sequence data with earlier generated short-read data. Incorporating new full-length transcripts to guide gene prediction, the C. goreaui genome (1.2 Gb) exhibits a high extent of completeness (82.4% based on BUSCO protein recovery) and better resolution of repetitive sequence regions; 45,322 gene models were predicted, and 327 putative, topologically associated domains of the chromosomes were identified. Comparison with other Symbiodiniaceae genomes revealed a prevalence of repeats and duplicated genes in C. goreaui, and lineage-specific genes indicating functional innovation. Incorporating 2,841,408 protein sequences from 96 broadly sampled eukaryotes and representative prokaryotes in a phylogenomic approach, we assessed the evolutionary history of C. goreaui genes. Of the 5,246 phylogenetic trees inferred from homologous protein sets containing two or more phyla, 35-36% have putatively originated via horizontal gene transfer (HGT), predominantly (19-23%) via an ancestral Archaeplastida lineage implicated in the endosymbiotic origin of plastids: 10-11% are of green algal origin, including genes encoding photosynthetic functions. Our results demonstrate the utility of long-read sequence data in resolving structural features of a dinoflagellate genome and highlight how genetic transfer has shaped genome evolution of a facultative symbiont, and more broadly of dinoflagellates.",

Using persistent homology statistics with a signed Euclidean distance transform filtration on binary patches of images, we are able to quantify the number, size, distribution, and crowding of holes within and across samples imaged at the microscale.

We show significant differences in topological statistics between the OcnVEGFKO and WT groups and, when classifying the males, or females respectively, into OcnVEGFKO or WT groups, we obtain high prediction accuracies of 98.7% (74.2%) and 77.8% (65.8%) respectively for SHG (TPaF) images.

    "abstract": "The serpin plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) spontaneously undergoes a massive structural change from a metastable, active conformation, with a solvent accessible reactive center loop (RCL), to a stable, inactive or latent conformation in which the RCL has inserted into the central {beta} sheet. Physiologically, conversion to the latent state is regulated by the binding of vitronectin which retards the rate of this latency transition approximately 2-fold. We investigated the effects of vitronectin on the PAI-1 latency transition using all-atom path sampling simulations in explicit solvent. In simulated latency transitions of free PAI-1, the RCL is quite mobile as is the gate, the region that impedes RCL access to the central {beta} sheet. This mobility allows the formation of a transient salt bridge that facilitates the transition, and this finding rationalizes existing mutagenesis results. Vitronectin binding reduces RCL and gate mobility by allosterically rigidifying structural elements over 40 [A] away from the binding site thus blocking the transition to the latent conformation. The effects of vitronectin are propagated by a network of dynamically correlated residues including a number of conserved sites that have previously been identified as important for PAI-1 stability. Simulations also revealed a transient pocket populated only in the vitronectin bound state which corresponds to a cryptic drug binding site identified by crystallography. Overall, these results shed new light on regulation of the PAI-1 latency transition by vitronectin and illustrate the potential of path sampling simulations for understanding functional conformational changes in proteins and for facilitating drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "Growth in most spring ephemerals is decreased under warmer temperatures. Although photosynthetic activities are improved at warmer temperatures, leaves senesce earlier, which prevents the bulb from reaching a larger size. A longer leaf life duration during a warm spring, therefore, may improve bulb mass. We tested this hypothesis by modulating leaf life span of Erythronium americanum through the application of Promalin(R) (PRO; cytokinins and gibberellins) that prolonged, or silver thiosulphate (STS) that reduced leaf duration. Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured along with leaf and bulb carbohydrate concentrations. Plants were also pulse labelled with 13CO2 to monitor sugar transport to the bulb. Lower photosynthetic rates and shorter leaf life span of STS plants reduced the quantity of C that they assimilated during the season, resulting in a smaller bulb compared to Control plants. PRO plants maintained their photosynthetic rates for a longer period than Control plants, yet final bulb biomass did not differ between them. We conclude that seasonal growth for E. americanum is not limited by leaf life duration under warm growing conditions, but rather by limited sink growth capacity. Under global warming, spring geophytes might be at risk of being reduced in size and eventually, reproducing less frequently.\n\nHighlightWarmer springs negatively affect trout lily growth and delaying leaf senescence in this spring ephemeral does not translate into a larger bulb if temperatures remain high during springtime.",

    "abstract": "Mechanosensory feedback of internal reproductive state drives decisions about when and where to reproduce.1 For instance, stretch in the Drosophila reproductive tract produced by artificial distention or from accumulated eggs regulates the attraction to acetic acid to ensure optimal oviposition.2 How such mechanosensory feedback modulates neural circuits to coordinate reproductive behaviors is incompletely understood. We previously identified a stretch-dependent homeostat that regulates egg laying in Caenorhabditis elegans. Sterilized animals lacking eggs show reduced Ca2+ transient activity in the presynaptic HSN command motoneurons that drive egg-laying behavior while animals forced to accumulate extra eggs show dramatically increased circuit activity that restores egg laying.3 Interestingly, genetic ablation or electrical silencing of the HSNs delays, but does not abolish, the onset of egg laying3-5 with animals recovering vulval muscle Ca2+ transient activity upon egg accumulation.6 Using an acute gonad microinjection technique to mimic changes in pressure and stretch resulting from germline activity and egg accumulation, we find that injection rapidly stimulates Ca2+ activity in both neurons and muscles of the egg-laying circuit. Injection-induced vulval muscle Ca2+ activity requires L-type Ca2+ channels but is independent of presynaptic input. Conversely, injection-induced neural activity is disrupted in mutants lacking the vulval muscles, suggesting  bottom-up feedback from muscles to neurons. Direct mechanical prodding activates the vulval muscles, suggesting they are the proximal targets of the stretch-dependent stimulus. Our results show that egg-laying behavior in C. elegans is regulated by a stretch-dependent homeostat that scales postsynaptic muscle responses with egg accumulation in the uterus.",

    "abstract": "Most vertebrates and invertebrates such as Drosophila melanogaster are able to move in complex environments due to their ability to integrate sensory information along with motor commands. Mechanosensory structures exist along each leg to assist in motor coordination by transmitting external cues or proprioceptive information to motor centers in the central nervous system. Nevertheless, how different mechanosensory structures engage these locomotor centers and their underlying circuits remains poorly understood.\n\nHere, we tested the role of mechanosensory structures in movement initiation by optogenetically stimulating specific classes of leg sensory structures. We found that stimulation of leg Mechanosensory Bristles (MsB) and femoral Chordotonal Organ (ChO) is sufficient to initiate forward movement in immobile animals. While the stimulation of the ChO required brain centers to induce forward movement, unexpectedly, brief stimulation of leg MsB triggered sustained cyclic motor activity dependent only on circuits within the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC). The duration of the MsB-induced movement was dependent on the number of excited cells and specific to leg afferents, since stimulation of MsB in other segments lead to different motor outcomes. MsB-mediated movement lacked inter and intra-leg coordination, but preserved antagonistic muscle activity within joints. Our data shows that sensory stimulation can act in combination with descending commands in order to elicit a faster response to mechanical stimulation. In addition, it sheds light on the ability of specific sensory circuits to modulate motor control, including initiation of movement, presenting a new system to better understand how different levels of coordination are controlled by VNC and central brain locomotor circuits.\n\nSignificance StatementSensory feedback is critical to allow smooth and stable locomotion. Proprioceptors interact directly with pre-motor centers optimizing and sustaining coordinated movement. However, initiation of moment is considered to be triggered by higher-order centers in the brain. Here we took advantage of the genetic toolkit provided by the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to optogenetically activate different classes of leg sensory cells in immobile animals. We found that leg mechanosensory bristles can specifically trigger sustained leg activity independently of higher-order centers as headless flies could sustain prolonged leg movement upon mechanosensory stimulation. Moreover, while this sensory-evoked movement lacks intra- and inter-leg coordination, it still preserved basic antagonistic muscle activity. These findings suggest a parallel mechanism to trigger fast movement upon sensory stimulation. In addition, it provides a new model for movement initiation and a point-of-entry to define pre-motor circuits.",

NK cells can be obtained from various sources, including umbilical cord blood (UCB) and adult peripheral blood (APB). Understanding the diversity of NK cell populations and their receptor expression in both UCB and APB will guide future therapeutic designs. In this study, we used a 20-colour flow cytometry panel to compare unstimulated and cytokine-activated UCB and APB NK cells. Our analysis showed that UCB NK cells express slightly higher levels of the immune checkpoints PD-1, TIGIT and CD96 compared to their APB counterparts. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering and principal component analyses revealed previously unappreciated differences in NK cell populations from UCB and APB. UCB was characterised by an enrichment in CD56neg as well as mature NKp46neg and CD56+CD16+ NK cell populations whereas CD57+ terminally differentiated NK cells with variable expression of KIRs and CD16 were found in APB. These populations were conserved following two-days of IL-15 culture as well as overnight stimulation with IL-12, IL-15, and IL-18. Interestingly, cytokine stimulation was associated with the up-regulation of LAG-3 and DNAM-1 together with the downregulation of NKG2D, TIGIT and CD16 on multiple NK cell subsets in both UCB and APB. TIM-3 was also up-regulated with activation, but only in UCB. Overall, our data indicate that NK cells in UCB have a more immature phenotype than APB NK cells and UCB NK cells might be more amenable to immune checkpoint therapy.",

    "abstract": "Neutrophils are short-lived cells of the innate immune system that play numerous roles in defense against infection, regulation of immune responses, tissue damage and repair, autoimmunity, and other non-communicable diseases. Understanding neutrophil function at a mechanistic level has been hampered by the difficulty of working with primary neutrophils, which die rapidly upon isolation, and the relative paucity of neutrophil cell lines. Murine neutrophil progenitors that are immortalized with estrogen-regulated expression of Hoxb8 differentiate into neutrophils upon withdrawal of estrogen and facilitate the quantitative production of neutrophils in vitro. Here we report the creation of a Cas9+ER-Hoxb8 neutrophil progenitor cell line that enables both forward and reverse genetic analysis of neutrophils for the first time. By editing progenitors via transduction with sgRNAs, and then withdrawing estrogen, Cas9 edited neutrophils are produced with high efficiency. Importantly, neutrophil differentiation of edited progenitors occurs both in vitro in cell culture and when transferred into murine recipients. To demonstrate the utility of Cas9+ER-Hoxb8 progenitors for forward genetics, we performed a pooled CRISPR screen to identify factors required for survival during neutrophil differentiation. This screen identified hundreds of genes both negatively and positively selected under differentiation conditions. One of the top hits from this screen was Cebpe, a transcription factor known to be required for neutrophil differentiation from pre-neutrophils to immature neutrophils. Using the progenitor cell line, we also confirmed that Cepbe is required for neutrophil differentiation in vivo, validating the utility of this cell line both for screening and for studying in vivo phenotypes. The genome-wide screen also identified all components of the WASH complex as being required for neutrophil differentiation, a finding that extends the known role of WASH in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation to later stages of neutrophil development. Taken together, we demonstrate that Cas9+ER-Hoxb8 immortalized neutrophils can be used to study neutrophil function both in vitro and in vivo. This new resource will enable the analysis of the role of neutrophils in numerous disease states using genetics for the first time.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of the sensory organ precursor (SOP) from the proneural equivalence group in Drosophila melanogaster is a paradigm for studying single cell fate specification through the process of lateral inhibition. Classical lateral inhibition models describing this selection process are based on a transcriptional feedback mechanism where inhibitory signals between neighbouring cells, mediated by Notch pathway, are coupled to an intracellular circuit regulating the expression of the Notch ligand Delta (Dl). It was previously shown that in addition to its ability to trans-activate Notch in neighbouring cells, Dl can also cis-inhibit Notch in the same cell. However, it remains unclear what role does cis-inhibition play during SOP selection, and how it contributes to the selection of only one SOP. Here we address these questions using the unexpected observation that the mammalian ligand Delta-like 1 (Dll1) can trans-activate but not cis-inhibit Notch in Drosophila. We develop a mathematical model for SOP selection, termed the two-channel SOP (TCS) model, where Dl activity, but not its expression, is regulated by two channels associated with the two E3 ubiquitin ligases Neuralized (Neur) and Mindbomb1 (Mib1). While the Neur-dependent channel is regulated by Notch signalling, the Mib1-dependent channel is not, leading to tissue-wide basal inhibitory activity. We show theoretically and experimentally that cis-inhibition is required for suppressing Mib1-dependent basal Notch activity. Thus, our results highlight the trade-off between basal Notch activity and cis-inhibition as a mechanism for singling out an SOP from the proneural equivalence group.",

    "abstract": "Invasive pond sliders (Trachemys scripta) have been released in thousands of freshwaters within Europe and reproduce in the southern states and even in warm areas of Germany. All member states of the European Union must have an action plan how to fight this invasive species. The German action plan focusses on informing the public, but to date no study investigated the impact of such actions. Instead, NGOs setting up information signs report that this does not stop the release of exotic pond turtles, but without any quantitative measure. In 2019, we put up an information sign at the Althrein of Kehl, an oxbow lake where for the first time it had been shown that T. scripta is breeding in Germany. I performed interviews with people walking along the oxbow lake before the sign was pit up in 2019, and again in 2022. Counts of exotic pond turtles still increased, but this was mainly due to an increased number of small pond turtles, while numbers of very large ones did not further increase. This indicates that the increase in peak counts might be rather due to local reproduction than additional release. After the information sign was set up, more people responded that the presence of exotic pond turtles is problematic for nature conservation and animal welfare, that its illegal to release them, and that they should be removed. This response was especially strong in people who had read the information sign. Independent of the information sign, most interviewed people stated that one should not release pond turtles into the wild, but bring them to animal shelters. While the data here only represent one single case study that might not be representative, its the first study showing that putting up information signs is effective in changing the attitude of people who had read it. This indicates that investment into informing the public is worthwhile, but also that at the same time evaluations of the impact of the measures are important. National action plans should focus on a combination of informing the public and removing the exotic pond turtles, but also on providing keepers of these animals the option to leave the animals at an animal shelter instead of releasing them into the wild.",

    "abstract": "A selective sweep occurs when positive selection drives an initially rare allele to high population frequency. In nature, the precise parameters of a sweep are seldom known: How strong was positive selection? Did the sweep involve only a single adaptive allele (hard sweep) or were multiple adaptive alleles at the locus sweeping at the same time (soft sweep)? If the sweep was soft, did these alleles originate from recurrent new mutations (RNM) or from standing genetic variation (SGV)? Here, we present a method based on supervised machine learning to infer such parameters from the patterns of genetic variation observed around a given sweep locus. Our method is trained on sweep data simulated with SLiM, a fast and flexible framework that allows us to generate training data across a wide spectrum of evolutionary scenarios and can be tailored towards the specific population of interest. Inferences are based on summary statistics describing patterns of nucleotide diversity, haplotype structure, and linkage disequilibrium, which are estimated across systematically varying genomic window sizes to capture sweeps across a wide range of selection strengths. We show that our method can accurately infer selection coefficients in the range 0.01 < s < 100 and classify sweep types between hard sweeps, RNM soft sweeps, and SGV soft sweeps with accuracy 69 % to 95 % depending on sweep strength. We also show that the method infers the correct sweep types at three empirical loci known to be associated with the recent evolution of pesticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster. Our study demonstrates the power of machine learning for inferring sweep parameters from present-day genotyping samples, opening the door to a better understanding of the modes of adaptive evolution in nature.\n\nAuthor summaryAdaptation often involves the rapid spread of a beneficial genetic variant through the population in a process called a selective sweep. Here, we develop a method based on machine learning that can infer the strength of selection driving such a sweep, and distinguish whether it involved only a single adaptive variant (a so-called hard sweep) or several adaptive variants of independent origin that were simultaneously rising in frequency at the same genomic position (a so-called soft selective sweep). Our machine learning method is trained on simulated data and only requires data sampled from a single population at a single point in time. To address the challenge of simulating realistic datasets for training, we explore the behavior of the method under a variety of testing scenarios, including scenarios where the history of the population of interest was misspecified. Finally, to illustrate the accuracy of our method, we apply it to three known sweep loci that have contributed to the evolution of pesticide resistance in Drosophila melanogaster.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila melanogaster has proven an effective system with which to understand the evolutionary genetics and molecular mechanisms of insecticide resistance. Insecticide use has left signatures of selection in the fly genome, and both functional and quantitative genetics studies in the system have identified genes and variants associated with resistance. Here, we use D. melanogaster and leverage a bulk phenotyping and pooled sequencing \"extreme QTL\" approach to genetically dissect variation in resistance to malathion, an organophosphate insecticide. We resolve two QTL (Quantitative Trait Loci), one of which implicates allelic variation at the cytochrome P450 gene Cyp6g1, a strong candidate based on previous work. The second shows no overlap with hits from a previous genomewide association study (GWAS) for malathion resistance, recapitulating other studies showing that different strategies for complex trait dissection in flies can yield apparently different architectures. Notably, we see no genetic signal at the Ace gene. Ace encodes the target of organophosphate insecticide inhibition, and GWAS have identified strong Ace-linked associations with resistance. The absence of QTL implicating Ace here is most likely because our mapping population does not segregate for several of the known functional polymorphisms impacting resistance at Ace, perhaps because our population is derived from flies collected prior to the widespread use of organophosphate insecticides. Our fundamental approach can be an efficient, powerful strategy to dissect genetic variation in resistance traits. Nonetheless, studies seeking to interrogate contemporary insecticide resistance variation may benefit from deriving mapping populations from more recently collected strains.",

    "abstract": "Supercritical angle fluorescence (SAF) microscopy is a novel imaging tool based on the use of distance-dependent fluorophore emission patterns to provide accurate locations of fluorophores relative to a surface. This technique has been used extensively to construct accurate cellular images and to detect surface phenomena in a static environment. However, the capability of SAF microscopy in monitoring dynamic surface phenomena and changes in millisecond intervals is underexplored. Here we report on a hardware add-on for a conventional inverted microscope coupled with a post-processing Python module that extends the capability of SAF microscopy to monitor dynamic surface phenomena thereby greatly expanding the range of potential applications of this tool. We first assessed the performance of the system by probing the specific binding of biotin-fluorescein conjugates to a neutravidin-coated cover glass in the presence of non-binding fluorescein. The SAF emission was observed to increase with the quantity of bound fluorophore on the cover glass. However, high concentration of unbound fluorophore also contributed to overall SAF emission, leading to over-estimation in surface-bound fluorescence. To expand the applications of SAF in monitoring surface phenomena, we monitored the non-specific surface adsorption of BSA and non-ionic surfactants on a Teflon-AF surface. Solution mixtures of BSA and nine Pluronic/Tetronic surfactants were exposed to a Teflon-AF surface. No significant BSA adsorption was observed in all BSA-surfactant solution mixture with negligible SAF intensity. Finally, we monitored the adsorption dynamics of BSA onto the Teflon-AF surface and observed rapid BSA adsorption on Teflon-AF surface within 10 seconds of addition. The adsorption rate constant (ka) and half-life of BSA adsorption on Teflon-AF were determined to be 0.2093{+/-}0.002 s-1 and 3.312{+/-}0.032 s respectively using a pseudo-first-order adsorption equation.",

The present study aimed to examine the trichome diversity and acylsugar concentration of 26 accessions of S. galapagense along with one cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum) and one cherry tomato (S. l. cerasiforme) cultivar. The results revealed large genetic variation among S. galapagense accessions for all studied traits. The S. galapagense accessions had significantly higher trichome types IV on the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of the leaf and greater acylsugar concentration but smaller leaflet area than cultivated tomato. The selected cherry tomato line represents greater trichome type IV and acylsugar than other groups. The acylsugar concentration was positively associated with trichome type IV but negatively associated with trichome type V on both leaf surfaces. Leaflet area was negatively associated with trichome IV density and acylsugar concentration. Analysis of DNA markers revealed the presence of two previously identified whitefly-resistance alleles in S. galapagense accessions.

By combining TRNs and chromatin interaction data of E. coli and B. subtilis, we explored the spatial organization characteristics of bacterial TRNs in many aspects such as regulation directions (positive and negative), central nodes (hubs, bottlenecks), hierarchical levels (top, middle, bottom) and network motifs (feed-forward loops and single input modules) of the TRNs and found that the bacterial TRNs have a variety of stable spatial organization features under different physiological conditions which may be closely related with basic life activities. Our findings provided new insights into the connection between transcriptional regulation and the spatial organization of chromosome in bacteria, and might serve as a foundation for spatial-distance-based gene circuit design in synthetic biology.",

    "abstract": "As a gateway for projections entering and exiting the cerebral cortex, the human thalamus processes information from sensory to cognition relevant to various neuropsychiatric disorders. It is composed of dozens of nuclei, which have been difficult to identify with clinical MR sequences. However, delineating thalamic nuclei accurately at an individual level is essential for precise neuromodulation treatment. Here, we not only identified the fine-grained thalamic nuclei using local diffusion properties in vivo but also employed a deep learning strategy to achieve highly reproducible individual-level parcellation. Using High-quality diffusion MRI (dMRI), we first constructed a fine-grained group thalamus atlas based on thalamic local diffusion features. Then, the high-probability core area of the group thalamus atlas was wrapped into the native space as prior guidance for individualized thalamus construction. Finally, we trained the semi-supervised multiple classification models to accurately construct the individualized thalamus atlas with single-subject local diffusion characteristics. Compared to group atlas registration and single-subject clustering strategies, our individualized thalamus atlas combines population commonality and individual specificity and is superior in depicting the individual thalamic nuclei boundaries. Besides, our atlas provides a more conspicuous capacity to capture the individual specificity of thalamic nuclei. Through the evaluation by 3.0T\\7.0T and test-retest dMRI datasets, the proposed high-probability group prior guided individualized thalamus construction pipeline is robust and repeatable in different magnetic field strengths and scanning batches. In addition, the individual parcellation of the thalamic nuclei has a good correspondence with the histological atlas and captured both higher group consistency and inter-subjects variations, which could be a valuable solution for precision clinical treatment.",

It remains unknown, if asthma or allergen- and virus-induced airway inflammation are risk factors or can constitute some forms of protection against COVID-19. ACE2 and other SARS-CoV-2-related host proteins are limiting factors of an infection, expression of which is regulated in a more complex way than previously anticipated. Hence, we studied the expression of ACE2 mRNA and protein isoforms, together with its glycosylation and spatial localization in house dust mite (HDM)-, interleukin-13 (IL-13)- and human rhinovirus (RV)-induced inflammation in the primary human bronchial airway epithelium of healthy subjects and patients with asthma. IL-13 decreased the expression of long ACE2 mRNA and glycosylation of full-length ACE2 protein via alteration of the N-linked glycosylation process, limiting its availability on the apical side of ciliated cells. RV infection increased short ACE2 mRNA, but it did not influence its protein expression. HDM exposure did not affect ACE2 mRNA or protein. IL-13 and RV significantly regulated mRNA, but not protein expression of TMPRSS2 and NRP1. Regulation of ACE2 and other host proteins was similar in healthy and asthmatic epithelium, underlining the lack of intrinsic differences, but rather the dependence on the inflammatory milieu in the airways.",

    "abstract": "As the world braces to enter its third year in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the need for accessible and effective antiviral therapeutics continues to be felt globally. The recent surge of Omicron variant cases has demonstrated that vaccination and prevention alone cannot quell the spread of highly transmissible variants. A safe and nontoxic therapeutic with an adaptable design to respond to the emergence of new variants is critical for transitioning to treatment of COVID-19 as an endemic disease. Here, we present a novel compound, called SBCoV202, that specifically and tightly binds the translation initiation site of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase within the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome, inhibiting viral replication. SBCoV202 is a Nanoligomer, a molecule that includes peptide nucleic acid sequences capable of binding viral RNA with single-base-pair specificity to accurately target the viral genome. The compound has been shown to be safe and nontoxic in mice, with favorable biodistribution, and has shown efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Safety and biodistribution were assessed after three separate administration methods, namely intranasal, intravenous, and intraperitoneal. Safety studies showed the Nanoligomer caused no outward distress, immunogenicity, or organ tissue damage, measured through observation of behavior and body weight, serum levels of cytokines, and histopathology of fixed tissue, respectively. SBCoV202 was evenly biodistributed throughout the body, with most tissues measuring Nanoligomer concentrations well above the compound KD of 3.37 nM. In addition to favorable availability to organs such as the lungs, lymph nodes, liver, and spleen, the compound circulated through the blood and was rapidly cleared through the renal and urinary systems. The favorable biodistribution and lack of immunogenicity and toxicity set Nanoligomers apart from other antisense therapies, while the adaptability of the nucleic acid sequence of Nanoligomers provides a defense against future emergence of drug resistance, making these molecules an attractive potential treatment for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Widespread antimicrobial resistance generates an urgent need to develop better disease prophylaxis for intestinal bacterial pathogens. While the first phase of infection with any bacterial pathogen is typically colonization of the mucosal surfaces, current vaccine strategies typically target invasive stages of disease. Here we demonstrate the ability to specifically generate sterilizing immunity against Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.Tm) at the level of gut lumen colonization using a combination of oral vaccination and a rationally-designed niche competitor strain. This is based on the proven ability of specific secretory IgA to generate a fitness disadvantage for a targeted bacterium, allowing a non-targeted competitor to rapidly overtake its niche. By hugely decreasing the population size of an intestinal pathogen during the early stages of infection, this improves protection of gut tissue compared to standard licensed animal vaccines. We demonstrate that most effective protection is generated when the niche competitor is derived from the pathogen and therefore occupies an identical niche. However, as this is unrealistic in real-world infections, we further demonstrate that robust protection can also be generated with a more distantly related \"probiotic\" niche competitor from a distinct species. Interestingly, focusing prophylaxis on the gut lumen reveals an uncoupling of protective mechanisms required for protection in the gut and gut tissues and those required for protecting against colonization of the spleen and liver. Therefore, while there is still potential to improve this approach by adding systemic immune activation, we nevertheless believe this is a fundamental step forward in our ability to manipulate colonization of intestinal bacteria with potential application to a wide-range of entero-pathogens, as well as to manipulation of microbiota composition.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial restriction-modification (R-M) systems are a first line immune defense against foreign DNA from viruses and other bacteria. While R-M systems are critical in maintaining genome integrity, R-M nucleases unfortunately present significant barriers to targeted genetic modification. Bacteria of the genus Fusobacterium are oral, Gram-negative, anaerobic, opportunistic pathogens that are implicated in the progression and severity of multiple cancers and tissue infections, yet our understanding of their direct roles in disease have been severely hindered by their genetic recalcitrance. Here, we demonstrate a path to overcome these barriers in Fusobacterium by using native DNA methylation as a host mimicry strategy to bypass R-M system cleavage of user introduced plasmid DNA. We report the identification, characterization, and successful use of Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) Type II and III DNA methyltransferase (DMTase) enzymes to produce a multi-fold increase in gene knockout efficiency in the strain Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum 23726 (Fnn 23726), as well as the first efficient gene knockouts and complementations in Fnn 25586. We show plasmid protection can be accomplished in vitro with purified enzymes, as well as in vivo in an E. coli host that constitutively expresses Fnn DMTase enzymes. By characterizing specific DMTases that are critical for bypassing R-M systems, we have enhanced our understanding of potential enzyme combinations, with the goal of expanding these studies to genetically modify clinical isolates of Fusobacterium that have thus far been inaccessible to molecular characterization. This proof-of-concept study provides a roadmap to guide molecular microbiology efforts of the scientific community to facilitate the discovery of new Fusobacterium virulence genes, thereby leading to a new era of characterizing how an oral opportunistic pathogen contributes to an array of human infections and diseases.\n\nIMPORTANCEFusobacterium nucleatum is an oral opportunistic pathogen associated with diseases including cancer and preterm birth. Our understanding of how this bacterium modulates human disease has been hindered by a lack of genetic systems. Here we show that F. nucleatum DNA methyltransferase modified plasmid DNA overcomes the transformation barrier and allows the development of genetic systems in previously inaccessible strains. We present a strategy that can be expanded to enable the genetic modification of clinical isolates, thereby fostering investigational studies to uncover novel host-pathogen interactions in Fusobacterium.",

    "abstract": "Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (Mimivirus) is a giant virus that infects Acanthamoeba species - opportunistic human pathogens. We applied long- and short-read sequencing to generate a de novo transcriptome of the host and followed the dynamics of both host and virus transcriptomes over the course of infection. The assembled transcriptome of the host included 22,604 transcripts and 13,043 genes, with N50 = 2,372 nucleotides. Functional enrichment analysis revealed major changes in the host transcriptome, namely, enrichment in downregulated genes associated with cytoskeleton homeostasis and DNA replication, repair, and nucleotide synthesis. These modulations, together with those implicated by other enriched processes, indicate cell cycle arrest, an event we demonstrated experimentally. We also observed upregulation of host genes associated with transcription, secretory pathways and, as reported here for the first time, peroxisomes and the ubiquitin-proteasome system. In Mimivirus, the early stages of infections were marked by upregulated genes related to DNA replication, transcription, translation, and nucleotide metabolism, and the later stages, by enrichment in genes associated with lipids metabolism, carbohydrates, and proteases. Some of the changes observed in the amoebal transcriptome likely point to Mimivirus infection causing the dismantling of the host cytoskeleton, the translocation of endoplasmic reticulum membranes to viral factory areas, and cell cycle arrest.",

    "abstract": "Abnormally high circulating androgen levels have been considered a causative factor for benign prostatic hypertrophy and prostate cancer. Recent studies suggested that gut bacteria can alter sex steroid profile of host; however, the underlying mechanisms and bacterial taxa remain elusive. Thauera sp. strain GDN1 is an unusual betaproteobacterium capable of aerobic and anaerobic androgen catabolism in environmental conditions (37{degrees}C) resembling the mammalian gut. The strain GDN1 administration to C57BL/6J mice through oral gavage profoundly affected gut bacterial community, along with an approximately 50% reduction in serum androgen level in male mice. Our RT-qPCR results revealed the differential expression of aerobic and anaerobic androgen catabolic genes in the mouse ileum (microaerobic) and caecum (anaerobic), respectively. Furthermore, androgenic ring-cleaved metabolites were detected in the mouse fecal extract. This study discovered that androgen serves as a carbon source of gut microbes and that androgen-catabolizing gut bacteria can modulate host circulating androgen levels.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThauera sp. strain GDN1 administration through oral gavage regulated mouse serum androgen levels.\nC_LIO_LIThe biochemical, genetic, and metabolite profile analyses revealed the occurrence of bacterial androgen catabolism in the mouse gut.\nC_LIO_LIAndrogen catabolism proceeds through the O2-dependent and O2-independent catabolic pathways in mouse ileum and caecum, respectively.\nC_LIO_LIA possibility to harness Thauera sp. strain GDN1 as a functional probiotic to treat hyperandrogenism.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=89 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500890v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@515126org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a696faorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1020beforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15da175_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In briefHsiao et al. found that oral administration of androgen-catabolizing Thauera species regulated mouse serum androgen level.
