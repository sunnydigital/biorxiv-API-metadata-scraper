    "abstract": "The protease caspase-3 is a key mediator of apoptotic programmed cell death. But weak or transient caspase activity can contribute to neuronal differentiation, axonal pathfinding, and synaptic long-term depression. Despite the importance of sublethal, or nonapoptotic, caspase activity in neurodevelopment and neural plasticity, there has been no simple method for mapping and quantifying nonapoptotic caspase activity in rodent brains. We therefore generated a transgenic mouse expressing a highly sensitive and specific fluorescent reporter of caspase activity, with peak signal localized to the nucleus. As a proof of concept, we first obtained evidence that nonapoptotic caspase activity influences neurophysiology in an amygdalar circuit. Then focusing on the amygdala, we were able to quantify a sex-specific persistent elevation in caspase activity in females after restraint stress. This simple in vivo caspase activity reporter will facilitate systems-level studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic phenomena in behavioral and pathological models.\n\nSignificance StatementCaspase-3 is an enzyme that can cause cell death when highly active but can also perform important cellular functions, such as maturation and structural changes, when only weakly or transiently active. Despite the importance of this nonlethal type of caspase activity, there is no straightforward method to measure it in live rodents. We therefore developed mice that have a fluorescent reporter that is sensitive enough to detect nonlethal caspase activity. Surprisingly, we found that weak caspase activity influences the synchrony of neuronal firing across different brain regions. We also observed increased caspase activity in female mice after severe stress. This simple caspase activity reporter can subserve multiple applications in behavior and pathology research.",

    "abstract": "The capacity to navigate by layout geometry has been widely recognized as a robust navigational strategy. It was reported in various species, albeit most studies were performed with vision-based paradigms. In the presented study, we aimed to investigate layout symmetry-based navigation in the house cricket, Acheta domesticus, in the absence of visual cues. For this purpose, we used a non-visual paradigm modeled on the Tennessee Williams setup. We also verified the inaccessibility of visual cues for tested insects using antennal positioning reflex towards looming stimulus and by testing the performance of blinded crickets. In the main experiment, we tested the crickets capacity to learn to find a cool spot positioned centrally in heated arenas of different shapes (i.e., circular, square, triangular, and asymmetric quadrilateral). We found that the symmetry of the arena significantly facilitates crickets learning to find the cool spot, indicated by the increase of time spent on the cool spot and decrease of the latency of locating it in subsequent trials. To investigate possible mechanisms utilized by crickets during the experiment, we analyzed insects approach paths to the spot. The trajectories were grouped in four distinct clusters corresponding to both heuristic and directed strategies of approaching the target, with the dominance of a semi-directed strategy (thigmotactic phase preceding direct navigation to the target). Against these results, we discuss the possibility of insects navigation by using a non-visual space representation and possible limitations of navigation capacities in such conditions in relation to multimodally-guided navigation.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have provided successful targeted therapies for patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Osimertinib (AZD9291) is a third-generation irreversible EGFR TKI that has received regulatory approval for overcoming resistance mediated by the EGFR T790M mutation as well as a first-line treatment targeting EGFR activating mutations. However, a significant fraction of patients cannot tolerate the adverse effect associated with AZD9291. In addition, brain metastases are common in patients with NSCLN and remain a major clinical challenge. Here, we report the development of a novel third-generation EGFR TKI, CM93. Compared to AZD9291, CM93 exhibits improved lung cancer targeting and brain penetration and has demonstrated promising antitumor efficacy in mouse models of both EGFR-mutant NSCLC orthotopic and brain metastases. In addition, we find that CM93 confers superior safety benefits in mice. Our results demonstrate that further evaluations of CM93 in clinical studies for patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC and brain metastases are warranted.",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays) starch is an important agricultural commodity that serves as food, feed, and a raw material for industrial purposes. It is organized into starch granules (SG) inside amyloplasts and is highly accumulated in endosperms. Maize hybrids, which exhibits heterosis over their parents, are globally grown due to higher vigor of the F1 plants. However, the parental effect on the size of SG in F1 hybrid seeds remains unclear. Here we compared the seed SG sizes among two parental inbred lines (Chang7-2 and Zheng58) as well as their reciprocal hybrids. SG was observed in situ and in vitro with SEM. The size of seed SG in hybrids was more like that of female parents, especially for large SG population. Thus, the control of SG size exhibits a maternal inheritance trend in the context of plastid (amyloplast) inheritance. Our results provide some insight on selecting parental inbred lines for breeding maize hybrids with different SG sizes.",

    "abstract": "Bone health is determined by factors including bone metabolism or remodeling. Wnt-10b alters osteoblastogenesis through pre-osteoblast proliferation and differentiation and osteoblast apoptosis rate, which collectively lead to the increase of bone density. To model this, we adapted a previously published model of bone remodeling. The resulting model for the bone compartment includes differential equations for active osteoclasts, pre-osteoblasts, osteoblasts, osteocytes, and the amount of bone present at the remodeling site. Our alterations to the original model consist of extending it past a single remodeling cycle and implementing a direct relationship to Wnt-10b. Four new parameters were estimated and validated using normalized data from mice. The model connects Wnt-10b to bone metabolism and predicts the change in trabecular bone volume caused by a change in Wnt-10b input. We find that this model predicts the expected increase in pre-osteoblasts and osteoblasts while also pointing to a decrease in osteoclasts when Wnt-10b is increased.",

    "abstract": "The pituitary gland produces and secretes a variety of hormones that are essential to life, such as for the regulation of growth and development, metabolism, reproduction, and the stress response. This is achieved through an intricate signalling interplay between the brain and peripheral feedback signals that shapes pituitary cell excitability by regulating ion channel properties of these cells. In addition, endocrine anterior pituitary cells fire action potentials spontaneously to regulate intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) level, an essential signalling conduit for hormonal secretion. To this end, pituitary cells have to critically regulate their resting membrane potential (RMP) close to firing threshold, but the molecular identity of the ionic mechanisms involved remains largely unknown. Here, we revealed that the sodium leak channel NALCN, known to modulate neuronal excitability elsewhere in the brain, acts to regulate excitability in the mouse anterior endocrine pituitary cells. Using viral transduction combined with powerful electrophysiology methods and calcium imaging, we show that NALCN forms the major Na+ leak conductance in these cells, appropriately tuning cellular RMP for sustaining spontaneous firing activity. Genetic interruption of NALCN channel activity drastically hyperpolarised the cells, suppressing firing and ([Ca2+]i) oscillations. Remarkably, we uncover that NALCN conductance formed a very small fraction of the total cell conductance, but yet had a profound impact on pituitary cell excitability. Our results also provide a possible mechanism through which hypothalamic and hormone feedback signals can powerfully affect pituitary activity to influence hormonal function.",

    "abstract": "Speciation, the continuous process by which new species form, is often investigated by looking at the variation of nucleotide diversity and differentiation across the genome (hereafter genomic landscapes). A key challenge lies in how to determine the main evolutionary forces at play shaping these patterns. One promising strategy, albeit little used to date, is to comparatively investigate these genomic landscapes as a progression through time by using a series of species pairs along a divergence gradient. Here, we resequenced 201 whole-genomes from eight closely related Populus species, with pairs of species at different stages along the divergence gradient to learn more about speciation processes. Using population structure and ancestry analyses, we document extensive introgression between some species pairs, especially those with parapatric distributions. We further investigate genomic landscapes, focusing on within-species (nucleotide diversity and recombination rate) and among-species (relative and absolute divergence) summary statistics of diversity and divergence. We observe highly conserved patterns of genomic divergence across species pairs. Independent of the stage across the divergence gradient, we find support for signatures of linked selection (i.e., the interaction between natural selection and genetic linkage) in shaping these genomic landscapes, along with gene flow and standing genetic variation. We highlight the importance of investigating genomic patterns on multiple species across a divergence gradient and discuss prospects to better understand the evolutionary forces shaping the genomic landscapes of diversity and differentiation.",

    "abstract": "BRAF is frequently mutated in human cancer and the RASopathy syndromes, with RASopathy mutations often observed in the cysteine-rich domain (CRD). Although the CRD participates in phosphatidylserine (PS) binding, the RAS-RAF interaction, and RAF autoinhibition, the impact of these activities on RAF function in normal and disease states is not well-characterized. Here, we analyze a panel of CRD mutations and show that they increase BRAF activity by relieving autoinhibition and/or enhancing PS binding, with relief of autoinhibition being the major factor determining mutation severity in zebrafish models. Further, we show that CRD-mediated autoinhibition is essential for preventing the constitutive plasma membrane localization of BRAF and increased RAS-dependent and RAS-independent function. Comparison of the BRAF- and CRAF-CRDs also indicates that the BRAF-CRD is a stronger mediator of autoinhibition and PS binding, and given the increased catalytic activity of BRAF, our studies reveal a more critical role for CRD-mediated autoinhibition in BRAF regulation.",

    "abstract": "Layer 6 corticothalamic (L6 CT) neurons are in a strategic position to control sensory input to the neocortex, yet we understand very little about their functions. Apart from studying their anatomical, physiological and synaptic properties, most recent efforts have focused on the activity-dependent influences CT cells can exert on thalamic and cortical neurons through causal optogenetic manipulations. However, few studies have attempted to study them during behavior. To address this gap, we performed juxtacellular recordings from optogenetically identified CT neurons in whisker-related primary somatosensory cortex (wS1) of awake, head-fixed mice (either sex) free to rest quietly or self-initiate bouts of whisking and locomotion. We found a rich diversity of response profiles exhibited by CT cells. Their spiking patterns were either modulated by whisking-related behavior ([~]28%) or not ([~]72%). Whisking-responsive neurons exhibited either increases, activated-type, or decreases in firing rates, suppressed-type, that aligned with whisking onset better than locomotion. We also encountered responsive neurons with preceding modulations in firing rate before whisking onset. Overall, whisking better explained these changes in rates than overall changes in arousal. Whisking-unresponsive CT cells were generally quiet, with many having low spontaneous firing rates, sparse-type, and others being completely silent. Remarkably, the sparse firing CT population preferentially spiked at the state transition point when pupil diameter constricted and the mouse entered quiet wakefulness. Thus, our results demonstrate that L6 CT cells in wS1 show diverse spiking patterns, perhaps subserving distinct functional roles related to precisely timed responses during complex behaviors and transitions between discrete waking states.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTLayer 6 corticothalamic neurons provide a massive input to the sensory thalamus and local connectivity within cortex, but their role in thalamocortical processing remains unclear due to difficulty accessing and isolating their activity. Although several recent optogenetic studies reveal that the net influence of corticothalamic actions, suppression versus enhancement, depends critically on the rate these neurons fire, the factors that influence their spiking are poorly understood, particularly during wakefulness. Using the well-established Ntsr1-Cre line to target this elusive population in the whisker somatosensory cortex of awake mice, we found that corticothalamic neurons show diverse state-related responses and modulations in firing rate. These results suggest separate corticothalamic populations can differentially influence thalamocortical excitability during rapid state transitions in awake, behaving animals.",

KMTs in mammalian cells are organized into bundles, so-called kinetochore-fibers (k-fibers), but the ultrastructure of these fibers is currently not well characterized. Here we show by large-scale electron tomography that each k-fiber in HeLa cells in metaphase is composed of approximately nine KMTs, only half of which reach the spindle pole. Our comprehensive reconstructions allowed us to analyze the three-dimensional (3D) morphology of k-fibers and their surrounding MTs in detail. We found that k-fibers exhibit remarkable variation in circumference and KMT density along their length, with the pole-proximal side showing a broadening. Extending our structural analysis then to other MTs in the spindle, we further observed that the association of KMTs with non-KMTs predominantly occurs in the spindle pole regions. Our 3D reconstructions have implications for KMT growth and k-fiber self-organization models as covered in a parallel publication applying complementary live-cell imaging in combination with biophysical modeling (Conway et al., 2022). Finally, we also introduce a new visualization tool allowing an interactive display of our 3D spindle data that will serve as a resource for further structural studies on mitosis in human cells.",

    "abstract": "Going beyond the traditional sparse multichannel peripheral human-machine interface that has been used widely in neurorobotics, high-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) has shown significant potential for decoding upper-limb motor control. We have recently proposed heterogeneous temporal dilation of LSTM in a deep neural network architecture for a large number of gestures (>60), securing spatial resolution and fast convergence. However, several fundamental questions remain unanswered. One problem targeted explicitly in this paper is the issue of \"electrode shift,\" which can happen specifically for high-density systems and during doffing and donning the sensor grid. Another real-world problem is the question of transient versus plateau classification, which connects to the temporal resolution of neural interfaces and seamless control. In this paper, for the first time, we implement gesture prediction on the transient phase of HD-sEMG data while robustifying the human-machine interface decoder to electrode shift. For this, we propose the concept of deep data augmentation for transient HD-sEMG. We show that without using the proposed augmentation, a slight shift of 10mm may drop the decoders performance to as low as 20%. Combining the proposed data augmentation with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we recovered the performance to 84.6% while securing a high spatiotemporal resolution, robustifying to the electrode shift, and getting closer to large-scale adoption by the end-users, enhancing resiliency.",

Global change can alter community assembly at both local and regional levels, potentially shifting communities into disequilibrium with their local environmental conditions. In this study, we evaluated the spatial variation in environmental filtering and habitat matching of 1078 riverine macroinvertebrate communities distributed across nine ecoregions within the conterminous United States.\n\nLocationConterminous United States.\n\nTaxonFreshwater macroinvertebrates.\n\nMethodsWe first quantified spatial patterns in environmental filtering, habitat matching, and functional trait diversity. We then used boosted regression trees to identify (1) functional trait predictors of environmental filtering and habitat matching and (2) environmental, landscape, and network variables that predict functional trait abundances.\n\nResultsOur results demonstrated that environmental filtering but not habitat matching varied strongly by ecoregion. We also found that functional trait diversity varied by ecoregion, but not as strongly as the signatures of environmental filtering. We did not identify consistent functional trait predictors for both environmental filtering and habitat matching, with trait predictors instead varying by individual traits, trait categories, and ecoregions. Notwithstanding inconsistent trait predictors, environmental filtering was primarily influenced by habitat preference traits while habitat matching was primarily influenced by both habitat preference and dispersal traits. Predictors of functional traits also varied by trait category and ecoregion, with habitat preference and dispersal traits primarily influenced by network variables.\n\nMain conclusionsOur study demonstrates the contingent patterns and drivers of environmental filtering and habitat matching on a macroecological scale. We aim for this work to provide the foundation on which trait-environment relationships can be further quantified and causal explanations established in the context of community disequilibrium and applied to conservation and management of freshwater systems.",

    "abstract": "Modern oncology offers a wide range of treatments and therefore choosing the best option for particular patient is very important for optimal outcomes. Multi-omics profiling in combination with AI-based predictive models have great potential for streamlining these treatment decisions. However, these encouraging developments continue to be hampered by very high dimensionality of the datasets in combination with insufficiently large numbers of annotated samples. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning-based method to predict patient-specific anticancer drug response from three types of multiomics data. The proposed DeepInsight-3D approach relies on structured data-to-image conversion that then allows use of convolutional neural networks, which are particularly robust to high dimensionality of the inputs while retaining capabilities to model highly complex relationships between variables. Of particular note, we demonstrate that in this formalism additional channels of an image can be effectively used to accommodate data from different  omics layers while explicitly encoding the connection between them. DeepInsight-3D was able to outperform two other state-of-the-art methods proposed for this task. These advances can facilitate the development of better personalized treatment strategies for different cancers in the future.",

    "abstract": "The pelagic longline fishery, in an effort to reduce bycatch of sea turtles, have developed and deployed fisheries bycatch mitigation techniques such as replacing J/tuna hooks and squid bait with circle hooks and whole fish bait. However, little emphasis has been placed on the side effects of bycatch mitigation measures on endangered species other than target bycatch species. Several previous studies of the side effects have been marred by lack of control for the covariates. Here, based on long-term data obtained from research cruises by a pelagic longline vessel, we examined the effects of using circle hooks and whole fish bait to replace squid bait on the fishing mortality of target and non-target fishes, and also bycatch species. A quantitative evaluation analysis of our results, based on a Bayesian approach, showed the use of circle hooks to increase mouth hooking in target and bycatch species, and their size to be proportional to the magnitude of the effect. Although deploying circle hooks increased fishing mortality per unit effort (MPUE) for shortfin mako shark, the magnitude of changing the bait species from squid to fish clearly had a far greater impact on MPUE than the use of circle hooks. Because the impact of the introduction of bycatch mitigation measures on species other than the focused bycatch species is non-negligible, a quantitative assessment of bycatch mitigation-related fishing mortality is critical before introducing such measures.",

    "abstract": "Reliable, easy-to-handle phenotypic screening platforms are needed for the identification of anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds. Here, we present caspase 3/7 activity as a read-out for monitoring the replication of SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different variants, including a remdesivir-resistant strain, and of other coronaviruses in a broad range of cell culture models, independently of cytopathogenic effect formation. Compared to other cell culture models, the Caco-2 subline Caco-2-F03 displayed superior performance, as it possesses a stable SARS-CoV-2 susceptible phenotype and does not produce false-positive hits due to drug-induced phospholipidosis. A proof-of-concept screen of 1796 kinase inhibitors identified known and novel antiviral drug candidates including inhibitors of PHGDH, CLK-1, and CSF1R. The activity of the PHGDH inhibitor NCT-503 was further increased in combination with the HK2 inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose, which is in clinical development for COVID-19. In conclusion, caspase 3/7 activity detection in SARS-CoV-2-infected Caco-2F03 cells provides a simple phenotypic high-throughput screening platform for SARS-CoV-2 drug candidates that reduces false positive hits.",

However, no one has systematically evaluated their regulatory effects. To facilitate rational selection of theophylline riboswitches, we examined 25 theophylline riboswitches in Escherichia coli and surprised to find that none of the five repressive riboswitches were more than 2-fold effective. To solve this problem, we rationally designed a transcriptional repressive riboswitch and demonstrated its effect not only in various bacterial strains but also in different growth media or different temperatures. By introducing two copies of theophylline riboswitches and a RepA protein degradation tag coding sequence at the 5-end of a reporter gene, we successfully constructed a dual gene expression regulatory system with up to 150-fold potency, namely the R2-RepA system. R2-RepA system is only 218 bp in length, expression of any protein could be repressed efficiently by simply inserting this system upstream of the target protein-coding sequence. This study represented a crucial step toward harnessing theophylline riboswitches and expanding the synthetic biology toolbox.",

Here we use Perturb-seq, combining genetic perturbations with a single-cell readout, to investigate how inactivation of host factors changes the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the host response in human lung epithelial cells. Our high-dimensional data resolve complex phenotypes such as shifts in the stages of infection and modulations of the interferon response. However, only a small percentage of host factors showed such phenotypes upon perturbation. We further identified the NF-{kappa}B inhibitor I{kappa}B (NFKBIA), as well as the translation factors EIF4E2 and EIF4H as strong host dependency factors acting early in infection. Overall, our study provides massively parallel functional characterization of host factors of SARS-CoV-2 and quantitatively defines their roles both in virus-infected and bystander cells.",

However, after a third dose of NVX-CoV2373, we observed high titers against Omicron BA.1 (GMT: 1,197) and BA.4 (GMT: 582), with responses similar in magnitude to those triggered by three doses of an mRNA vaccine.

Although mounting evidence has revealed the critical function of the gut bacteriome in the progression of CRC, the contribution of gut viral community to CRC is rarely studied.\n\nObjectivesThe present study aimed to reveal the gut virome signatures of colorectal adenoma patients and CRC patients and decipher the potential viral markers to build clinical predictive models for diagnosis.\n\nMethods1,282 available fecal metagenomes data from 9 published CRC studies were collected. A new virus database was constructed based on a reference-independent virome approach for further analysis. Viral markers were filtered by statistical methods and used to build machine learning models such as Random Forest and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) to distinguish patients from controls. New fecal samples were collected to validate the generalization of predictive model.\n\nResultsThe gut viral composition of CRC patients was drastically altered compared with healthy, as evidenced by changes in several Siphoviridae viruses and a reduction of Microviridae, whereas the virome variation in adenoma patients was relatively low. The viral markers contained the phages of Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium, Hungatella, and Ruminococcaceae. In 9 cohorts and independent validation cohorts, a random forest (RF) classifier and LASSO model got the optimal AUC 0.830 and 0.906, respectively. While the gut virome analysis of adenoma patients identified 88 differential viruses and achieved an optimal AUC of 0.772 for discriminating patients from controls.\n\nConclusionOur findings demonstrate the distinctly different composition of gut virome between healthy controls and CRC patients, and highlight the potential of viral markers for clinical diagnosis.",

The subcellular localization of fourteen lncRNAs associated with sarcomas were examined in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. We used 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to assay uncapped forms of these lncRNAs.

Different feeding habits, such as hematophagy, can shape gene functions to meet the challenges of each type of diet. A comparison of transcriptomic and proteomic data indicates that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is crucial in triatomines, so we evaluated the impact of RNAi silencing of the eukaryotic translation initiation factors 3 subunit m (eIF3m) in R. prolixus physiology. We showed that eIF3m is essential for correct digestion, affecting the processes triggered by a blood meal. The silencing of this gene inhibited moulting and caused the premature death of nymphs, while in adult females inhibited oviposition and increased resistance to starvation. Male survival was not affected by eIF3m knockdown. The information regarding the eIF3m function in insects is scarce. The phenotypes observed in R. prolixus upon eIF3m gene silencing are different and more severe than those described in Drosophila melanogaster, pointing to the particular importance of this gene in triatomines.\n\nSummary statementThe information provided here indicates the importance of mRNA translation in modulating growth, reproduction, lifespan and starvation resistance in triatomine vectors.",

Here, we show that in quiescent mouse splenocytes, AGO2 localizes almost exclusively to the nucleus. AGO2 subcellular localization is modulated by the Pi3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, a well-established regulator of quiescence. Signaling through this pathway in proliferating cells promotes AGO2 cytoplasmic accumulation, at least in part by stimulating the expression of TNRC6, an essential AGO2 binding partner in the miRNA pathway. In quiescent cells where mTOR signaling is low, AGO2 accumulates in the nucleus where it binds to young mobile transposons co-transcriptionally to repress their expression via its catalytic domain. Our data point to an essential but previously unrecognized nuclear role for AGO2 during quiescence as part of a genome-defense system against young mobile elements and provide evidence of RNA interference in the soma of mammals.",

How mutant clones, carrying an oncogenic mutation that often drives unchecked proliferation leads to controlled and coordinated overgrowth is unknown. We use the zebrafish to explore growth dynamics of oncogenic clones during development. In subset of clones, we observe a local increase in proportion of the fin skeleton closely resembling patient overgrowth phenotypes. We unravel the cellular and developmental mechanisms of these overgrowths and pinpoint the cell type and timing of clonal expansion. Coordinated overgrowth is associated with rapid clone expansion during early pre-chondrogenic phase of bone development inducing a heterochronic shift that drives the change in bone size. Our study details how development integrates and translates growth potential of oncogenic clones, thereby shaping the phenotypic consequences of somatic mutations.",

    "abstract": "Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is life-threatening severe dengue with a hallmark of vascular leakage. A mast cell protease, {beta}-tryptase, has been found to promote vascular leakage in DHF patients, which could be a potential target for the treatment of DHF. This study aims to develop a theoretical background for the design and selection of {beta}-tryptase inhibitors through these approaches: two-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationships (2D-QSAR) study, molecular docking analysis, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and structure-based pharmacophore modelling (PM). A total of 34 a-keto-[1,2,3]-oxadiazoles scaffold-based compounds, obtained from a past study, were used to generate 2D-QSAR models by Genetic Function Approximation (GFA). The generated 2D-QSAR models were used to investigate the relationships between the molecular structure and the potency of {beta}-tryptase inhibition. Molecular docking explores the binding affinities and binding interactions of the a-keto-[1,2,3]-oxadiazoles scaffold-based compounds with {beta}-tryptase (PDB Code 4A6L) by the CDOCKER tool in Discovery Studio. In addition, MD simulation was performed using GROMACS on the docked complex of the reported most active compound, compound 11e, to study the binding mechanism of the compound towards {beta}-tryptase. Finally, a structure-based pharmacophore model was generated from the same docked complex to identify the important features that contribute positively to the inhibitory activity of the compound towards {beta}-tryptase. The best 2D-QSAR model has demonstrated statistically significant results through its r2, q2, and r2 (pred) values of 0.9077, 0.733, and 0.8104, respectively. The docking results of compound 11e showed lower CDOCKER energy than the 4A6L co-crystallised ligand, indicating good binding affinity. Furthermore, compound 11e has a similar binding pattern as the 4A6L co-crystallised ligand, which involves the binding of active residues such as Asp207, SER208, and GLY237. The MD simulation shows that the 4A6L-compound 11e complex has RMSD below 2[A] throughout the 100ns of simulation, indicating that the docked complex is stable. Besides, MD simulation showed that the inhibitory potency of compound 11e is contributed by hydrogen bonding with 4A6L active site residues, which are ASP207, SER208, and GLY237. The best pharmacophore model identified features that contribute to the inhibitory potency of a compound, which included hydrogen bond acceptor, ionic interaction, hydrophobic interaction, and aromatic ring. This study has fundamentally supplied valuable insight and knowledge for developing novel chemical compounds with improved inhibitory ability against human {beta}-tryptase.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=91 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500327v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e277c4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1250185org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@86fed8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c54035_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG DENV induces mast cell degranulation to release mediators, such as {beta}-tryptase. {beta}-Tryptase has been reported to promote plasma leakage, which is the hallmark of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF).

    "abstract": "Disruption of the transverse-axial tubule system (TATS) in diseases such as heart failure and atrial fibrillation occurs in combination with changes in the expression and distribution of key Ca2+- handling proteins. Together this ultrastructural and ionic remodeling is associated with aberrant Ca2+ cycling and electrophysiological instabilities that underly arrhythmic activity. However, due to the concurrent changes in TATs and Ca2+-handling protein expression and localization that occur in disease it is difficult to distinguish their individual contributions to the arrhythmogenic state. To investigate this, we applied our novel 3D human atrial myocyte model with spatially detailed Ca2+ diffusion and TATS to investigate the isolated and interactive effects of changes in expression and localization of key Ca2+-handling proteins and variable TATS density on Ca2+- handling abnormality driven membrane instabilities. We show that modulating the expression and distribution of the sodium-calcium exchanger, ryanodine receptors, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ buffer calsequestrin have varying pro and anti-arrhythmic effects depending on the balance of opposing influences on SR Ca2+ leak-load and Ca2+-voltage relationships. Interestingly, the impact of protein remodeling on Ca2+-driven proarrhythmic behavior varied dramatically depending on TATS density, with intermediately tubulated cells being more severely affected compared to detubulated and densely tubulated myocytes. This work provides novel mechanistic insight into the distinct and interactive consequences of TATS and Ca2+-handling protein remodeling that underlies dysfunctional Ca2+ cycling and electrophysiological instability in disease.\n\nKey PointsO_LIIn our companion paper we developed a 3D human atrial myocyte model, coupling electrophysiology and Ca2+ handling with subcellular spatial details governed by the transverse-axial tubule system (TATS).\nC_LIO_LIHere we utilize this model to mechanistically examine the impact of TATS loss and changes in the expression and distribution of key Ca2+-handling proteins known to be remodeled in disease on Ca2+ homeostasis and electrophysiological stability.\nC_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that varying the expression and localization of these proteins has variable pro- and anti-arrhythmic effects with outcomes displaying dependence on TATS density.\nC_LIO_LIWhereas detubulated myocytes typically appear unaffected and densely tubulated cells seem protected, the arrhythmogenic effects of Ca2+ handling protein remodeling are profound in intermediately tubulated cells.\nC_LIO_LIOur work shows the interaction between TATS and Ca2+-handling protein remodeling that underlies the Ca2+-driven proarrhythmic behavior observed in AF and may help to predict the effects of antiarrhythmic strategies at varying stages of ultrastructural remodeling.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Sleep plays a critical role in consolidating many forms of hippocampus-dependent memory. While various classes of hypnotic drugs have been developed in recent years, it remains unknown whether, or how, some of them affect sleep-dependent memory consolidation mechanisms. We find that ML297, a recently-developed candidate hypnotic agent targeting a new mechanism (activating GIRK1-subunit containing G-protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium [GIRK] channels), alters sleep architecture in mice over the first 6 h following a single-trial learning event. Following contextual fear conditioning (CFC), ML297 reversed post-CFC reductions in NREM sleep spindle power and REM sleep amounts and architecture, renormalizing sleep features to what was observed at baseline, prior to CFC. Renormalization of post-CFC REM sleep latency, REM sleep amounts, and NREM spindle power were all associated with improved contextual fear memory (CFM) consolidation. We find that improvements in CFM consolidation due to ML297 are sleep-dependent, and are associated with increased numbers of highly-activated dentate gyrus (DG), CA1, and CA3 neurons during CFM recall. Together our findings suggest that GIRK1 channel activation restores normal sleep architecture - including REM sleep, which is normally suppressed following CFC - and increases the number of hippocampal neurons incorporated into the CFM engram during memory consolidation.\n\nSignificance StatementBoth REM and NREM sleep are thought to be important for consolidating hippocampus-dependent memories. We find that GIRK1 activator ML297, administered after single-trial fear learning, restores REM sleep that is normally suppressed after learning fearful associations. This restoration is associated with improvements in fear memory storage, resulting in more robust hippocampus activation in the context of subsequent memory recall. Thus this drug, which also has antiepileptic and anxiolytic properties, may be useful for promoting normal, restorative sleep that benefits memory storage.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of translation in astrocytes, the main glial cells in the brain, remains poorly characterized. We developed a high-throughput proteomic screen for polysome-associated proteins in astrocytes and focused on the ribosomal protein receptor of activated protein C kinase 1 (RACK1), a critical factor in translational regulation. In astrocyte somata and perisynaptic astrocytic processes (PAPs), RACK1 preferentially bound to a number of mRNAs, including Kcnj10, encoding the inward rectifying potassium (K+) channel KIR4.1, a critical astrocytic regulator of neurotransmission. By developing an astrocyte-specific, conditional RACK1 knock-out mouse model, we showed that RACK1 repressed the production of KIR4.1 in hippocampal astrocytes and PAPs. Reporter-based assays revealed that RACK1 controlled Kcnj10 translation through the transcripts 5 untranslated region. Upregulation of KIR4.1 in the absence of RACK1 modified the astrocyte territory volume and neuronal activity attenuatin burst frequency and duration in the hippocampus. Hence, astrocytic RACK1 represses KIR4.1 translation and influences neuronal activity.",

    "abstract": "Physiological and pathological pain exhibits striking diurnal variation, but the underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. We now describe an independent molecular clock in peripheral sensory neurons and satellite glial cells of sensory ganglia. We show that it is the sensory neuron transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs) that are responsible for diurnal pain behaviors. This clock regulates diurnal neurophysiological responses to a range of ligands, as well as synaptic activities of primary nociceptors. Furthermore, we find that loss of Cry1 and Cry2, the repressive arm of the core TTFLs, intensifies pain responses associated with increased voltage-gated sodium channel currents. Conversely, stabilization of CRY1 and CRY2 using the small molecule KL001, reduces pain sensitivity. Our results highlight novel opportunities to address chronic pain by directly harnessing circadian mechanisms.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA peripheral pain clock governs daily pain fluctuations, which can be harnessed for treating pain disorders.",

    "abstract": "Real-space refinement of atomic models improves them by their fit to experimental scattering electrostatic potential maps in cryo electron microscopy and to electron density maps in crystallography. This procedure has a number of advantages in comparison with reciprocal-space refinement, is complementary to it in crystallographic studies and is the principal technique in cryo EM. An accurate real-space refinement of atomic models can be done by comparison of the model maps, calculated according to the respective theory, with the experimental ones, when the former mimic imperfections of the latter, mainly a limited resolution and an atomic disorder. Calculation of model maps as a sum of contributions of individual atoms means that these contributions - atomic images in the given map - should also be affected by the resolution and positional disorder. This blurs atomic images and surrounds their central peak by Fourier ripples. These ripples can be described by a specially designed function which allows combining both principal effects of map imperfection in an analytic way. The atomic images, at any resolution and with any value of the atomic displacement parameter, can be decomposed into a linear combination of such functions with the precalculated parameter values. As a consequence, each map value becomes an analytic function of atomic parameters including displacement parameter and a local resolution if required. Using the chain rule for the score function which compares the maps, such model results in analytic expressions for its partial derivatives with respect to all atomic parameters allowing an efficient real-space refinement. At the same time, for practical calculations atomic images are cut at some truncation distance, i.e., include a limited number of ripples. This introduced in the model maps errors which are not present in the experimental maps. Due to oscillating behavior of the atomic images, the choice of the value of this truncation distance is not straightforward and discussed in this work.\n\nSynopsisA new method is suggested to calculate maps of a limited and eventually inhomogeneous resolution as an analytic function of all atomic parameters, including local resolution.",

    "abstract": "Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are widely used in agriculture. While acute cholinergic toxicity has been extensively studied, chronic effects on other neurons are less understood. Here, we demonstrated that the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and its oxon metabolite are dopaminergic neurotoxicants in Caenorhabditis elegans. CPF treatment led to inhibition of mitochondrial complex II, II + III, and V in rat liver mitochondria, while CPF oxon did not (complex II + III, and IV inhibition observed only at high doses). While the effect on C. elegans cholinergic behavior was mostly reversible with toxicant washout, dopamine-associated deficits persisted, suggesting dopaminergic neurotoxicity was irreversible. CPF reduced the mitochondrial content in a dose-dependent manner and the fat modulatory genes cyp-35A2 and cyp-35A3 were found to have a key role in CPF neurotoxicity. These findings were consistent with in vitro effects of CPF and CPF oxon on nuclear receptor signaling and fatty acid/steroid metabolism observed in ToxCast assays. Two-way hierarchical analysis revealed in vitro effects on estrogen receptor (ER,) pregnane X receptor (PXR), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) pathways as well as neurotoxicity of chlorpyrifos, malathion, and diazinon, while these effects were not detected in malaoxon and diazoxon. Taken together, our study suggests that mitochondrial toxicity and metabolic effects of CPF, but not CPF-oxon, have a key role of CPF neurotoxicity in the low-dose, chronic exposure. Further mechanistic studies are needed to examine mitochondria as a common target for all OP pesticide parent compounds, since this has important implications on cumulative pesticide risk assessment.",

    "abstract": "Cocaine use disorder occurs in an environment where cocaine and other nondrug commodities are concurrently available. Preclinical drug-vs-nondrug choice procedures are one simplified method of modeling this complex clinical environment. The present study established a discrete-trial progressive-ratio (PR) cocaine-vs-social interaction choice procedure in male and female rats and determined sensitivity of choice behavior to manipulations of reinforcer magnitude and non-contingent \"sample\" reinforcer presentation. Rats could make up to nine discrete choices between an intravenous cocaine infusion (0.1 - 1.0 mg/kg/inf) and social interaction with a same-sex social \"Partner\" rat. Cocaine infusions were available under a PR schedule of reinforcement, and social interaction was available under a fixed-ratio (FR) 3 schedule. Social interaction was chosen over no or small cocaine doses (saline, 0.01 mg/kg/inf) and behavior was reallocated away from social and towards cocaine at larger cocaine doses (1.0 mg/kg/inf). Manipulating social interaction time as one method to alter social reinforcer magnitude did not significantly alter cocaine-vs-social choice. Removing the non-contingent reinforcer presentations before the discrete choice trials also failed to affect cocaine-vs-social choice, suggesting the time interval was sufficient to minimize any potential influence of the non-contingent cocaine infusions on subsequent choice behavior. Overall, the present results were consistent with previous drug-vs-social choice studies and extend our knowledge of environmental factors impacting drug-vs-social choice. Future studies determining the pharmacological sensitivity of cocaine-vs-social choice will be important in expanding the preclinical utility of these procedures for candidate medication drug development.",

    "abstract": "Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTI) are a recently available class of antiretroviral therapy (ART) medications with a good tolerability profile and a high genetic barrier to HIV drug resistance. However, several studies report more significant weight gain among persons receiving INSTI-based ART regimens for initial therapy compared to protease inhibitors (PIs) and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI)-based regimens. In our experimental setting, we used the in vitro model of adipogenesis of 3T3-L1 cells to investigate the effects of the NRTIs tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), alone or in combination with four integrase strand transfer inhibitors: raltegravir (RAL), elvitegravir (ELV), dolutegravir (DTG) and bictegravir (BIC) on adipose differentiation. In addition, protein expression levels of PPAR{gamma} and C/EBP, and the intracellular lipid accumulation by Red Oil staining, were used to monitor adipocyte differentiation. Compared to control, RAL, ELV, DTG, and BIC were all able to increase adipogenesis, being in this, RAL and ELV more efficient. On the other hand, TAF and TDF inhibited adipogenesis. Moreover, when used in combination with the other INSTI molecules, TAF and TDF were able to reduce the adipogenic effects of all four drugs. This ability was more evident when TAF was used in combination with DTG and BIC. All these data suggest that TAF and TDF have an inhibitory effect on adipogenesis in vitro and that they could also effectively counteract the increased adipogenesis caused by the treatment with INSTIs. Finally, to evaluate if the 3T3-L1 cell could express fibroblast-like features following INSTIs treatment, we evaluated the immunohistochemical expression of ER-TR7, a well-known fibroblastic marker. This last assay showed that treatment with INSTIs increased the expression of ER-TR7 compared to control and to cells treated with TAF o TDF.\n\nIn conclusion, our experimental data support the evidence that in vitro challenge of 3T3-L1 cells with INSTIs is able to increase adipocytic differentiation and to drive a number of these cells toward the expression of fibroblastic features, with a different degree according to the various drugs used, while TAF and TDF have an antagonistic role on this phenomenon.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular calcium (Ca2+) cycling is tightly regulated in the healthy heart ensuring effective contraction. This is achieved by transverse (t)-tubule membrane invaginations that facilitate close coupling of key Ca2+-handling proteins such as the L-type Ca2+ channel (LCC) and Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) on the cell surface with ryanodine receptors (RyRs) on the intracellular Ca2+ store. Though less abundant and regular than in the ventricle, t-tubules also exist in atrial myocytes as a network of transverse invaginations with axial extensions known as the transverse-axial tubule system (TATS). In heart failure and atrial fibrillation there is TATS remodeling that is associated with aberrant Ca2+-handling and Ca2+-induced arrhythmic activity, however the mechanism underlying this is not fully understood. To address this, we developed a novel 3D human atrial myocyte model that couples electrophysiology and Ca2+-handling with variable TATS organization and density. We extensively parameterized and validated our model against experimental data to build a robust tool examining TATS regulation of subcellular Ca2+ release. We found that varying TATS density and thus the localization of key Ca2+-handling proteins has profound effects on Ca2+ handling. Following TATS loss there is reduced NCX that results in increased cleft Ca2+ concentration through decreased Ca2+ extrusion. This elevated Ca2+ increases RyR open probability causing spontaneous Ca2+ releases and promotion of arrhythmogenic waves (especially in the cell interior) that leads to voltage instabilities through delayed afterdepolarizations. In summary, this study demonstrates a mechanistic link between TATS remodeling and Ca2+-driven proarrhythmic behavior that likely reflects the arrhythmogenic state observed in disease.\n\nKey PointsO_LITransverse-axial tubule systems (TATS) modulate Ca2+ handling and excitation-contraction coupling in atrial myocytes, with TATS remodeling in heart failure and atrial fibrillation associated with altered Ca2+ cycling and subsequent arrhythmogenesis.\nC_LIO_LITo investigate the poorly understood mechanisms linking TATS variation and spontaneous Ca2+ release, we built, parameterized and validated a 3D human atrial myocyte model coupling electrophysiology and spatially-detailed subcellular Ca2+ handling governed by the TATS.\nC_LIO_LISimulated TATS loss causes diastolic Ca2+ and voltage instabilities through reduced NCX-mediated Ca2+ removal, cleft Ca2+ accumulation and increased RyR open probability, resulting in spontaneous Ca2+ release and promotion of arrhythmogenic waves and delayed afterdepolarizations.\nC_LIO_LIAt fast electrical rates typical of atrial tachycardia/fibrillation, spontaneous Ca2+ releases are larger and more frequent in the cell interior than at the periphery.\nC_LIO_LIOur work provides mechanistic insight into how atrial TATS remodeling can lead to Ca2+- driven instabilities that may ultimately contribute to the arrhythmogenic state in disease.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The stomatal complex of grasses consists of two guard cells and two adjacent subsidiary cells that cooperate during stomatal closure. Zymoseptoria tritici, the main causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch in wheat, enters the host via stomata. Here we test the hypothesis that the stomatal complex shows focused sub-cellular responses to invading Z. tritici hyphae.\n\nWe have combined live-cell transmission light microscopy, immunofluorescence and CRS microscopy to identify cell wall modifications triggered by hyphal invasion. Furthermore, we have used confocal fluorescence microscopy and automated quantitative image analysis to assess whether host cells respond to hyphae through spatial redistribution of organelles.\n\nWe find that subsidiary cells construct papillae that are accurately aligned with hyphal position even when hyphae are occluded by guard cells. These are distinct from those induced by powdery mildew, with callose restricted to a crust that surrounds content with a high-amplitude Raman signal in the CH-band. Peroxisome populations in subsidiary cells show distributions with modes weakly correlated with hyphal position but do not differ significantly between compatible and incompatible interactions.\n\nOur data suggest local changes to cell wall architecture and focal accumulation of organelles in subsidiary cells could play roles in crop defence during host leaf penetration by Z. tritici. Molecular strategies to amplify these responses may provide novel routes for crop protection.",

    "abstract": "Y900 is one of the top hybrid rice varieties with a yield exceeding 15 t/hm2. To dissect the mechanism of heterosis, the male parent line R900 and female parent line Y58S were sequenced using long-read and Hi-C technology. High-quality reference genomes of sizes of 396.41 Mb and 398.24 Mb were obtained for R900 and Y58S, respectively. Genome-wide variations between the parents were systematically identified, including 1,367,758 SNPs and 299,149 Indels. No megabase level structural variations exist. >75% of genes exhibited variation between the two parents. Compared with other two-line hybrids sharing the same female parent, the Geng/japonica-type genetic components from different male parents showed an increasing trend from phase 2-4 super-hybrid rice; Transcriptome analysis revealed that additive and dominance effects are the main genetic effects that constitute the heterosis of Y900. Allele-specific expression patterns and expression regulation patterns are quite dynamic in different tissues. For young panicle tissues, cis-regulation is dominant, while trans-regulation is more popular in leaf issues. Overdominance is more likely regulated by the trans-regulation mechanism. The differential gene expression and regulation pattern are closely related to Geng/japonica introgression. Additionally, R900 contained several excellent japonica haplotypes, such as NAL1, OsSPL13, Ghd8, OsBRI1, and DTH2, which make a good complement to Y58S. The fine tune mechanism through dynamic expression or regulation pattern change, especially on some key functional genes, is the base for heterosis.",

    "abstract": "Milk production loss due to mastitis in dairy herds is economically important. Before estimating the economic impacts of mastitis, it is crucial to quantify the association between mastitis and milk production. The objective of this study was to estimate the association between somatic cell count (SCC, as an indicator of intramammary infection due to mastitis) and milk production for dairy cows in Lombardy (Italy). The test-day (TD) records data of 3,816 dairy herds located in 3 different geographical areas of Lombardy from January 2016 to December 2018 were used. After data editing, the final dataset comprised 10,445,464 TD records from 2,970 farms and 826,831 cows. The analysis was carried out by using a mixed-effects model with seven fixed effects (geographical area, breed, days in milk, parity, season and year) and nested random effects for each cow and herd. The results indicated that the SCC had a negative association with milk production. When the SCC increased every two-fold, the milk production lost 0.830 (95% CI: -0.832, -0.828) kg/cow/day in the whole Lombardy. These results can be used for economic calculations on the costs of mastitis",

    "abstract": "Giant kelp forests off the west coast of North America are maintained primarily by sea otter (Enhydra lutris) and sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) predation of sea urchins. Human hunting of sea otters in historic times, together with a marine heat wave and sea star wasting disease epidemic in the past decade, have devastated these predators, leading to widespread occurrences of urchin barrens. Since the late Neogene, species of the megaherbivorous sirenian Hydrodamalis ranged throughout North Pacific giant kelp forests. The last species, H. gigas, was driven to extinction by human hunting in the mid-18th century. H. gigas was an obligate kelp canopy browser, and its body size implies that it would have had a significant impact on the system. Here we hypothesize that sea cow browsing would have promoted a denser understory algal assemblage than is typical today, thereby providing an alternative food resource for urchins, resulting in enhanced forest resilience. We tested this hypothesis with a mathematical model, comparing historical and modern community responses to marine heat waves, sea star wasting disease, and the presence of sea otters. We found that forest communities were highly resistant to marine heat waves, yet susceptible to sea star wasting disease, and to disease in combination with warming. Resistance was greatest among systems with both sea cows and sea otters present. Most simulations that transitioned to barrens did so temporarily, recovering after about 10 years. Historical communities, however, exhibited delayed transitions after perturbation relative to modern communities and faster recovery times. Sea cow browsing facilitated denser algal understories, enhancing resilience against modern perturbations. We propose that operationalizing these findings by mimicking the ecological impact of sea cow herbivory could enhance kelp forest resilience.",

    "abstract": "Michigans water-quality standards specify that E. coli concentrations at bathing beaches must not exceed 300 E. coli per 100 mL, as determined by the geometric mean of culture-based concentrations in three or more representative samples from a given beach on a given day. Culture-based analyses require 18-24 h to complete, so results are not available for issuing beach notifications (advisories or closings) until the day following collection. This one-day delay is problematic because E. coli concentrations at beaches can change markedly from one day to the next. qPCR-based E. coli concentrations, by contrast, can be obtained in only 3-4 h, making same-day beach notifications possible. Michigan has proposed a qPCR threshold value (qTV) for E. coli of 1.863 log10 gene copies per reaction as a potential equivalent value to the state standard, based on statistical analyses of a set of training data from 2016-2018. The main purpose of the present study is to assess the validity of the proposed qTV by determining whether the implied qPCR-based beach notification decisions agree well with culture-based decisions on two sets of test data (from 2016-2018 and 2019-2020), and whether performance of the proposed threshold is similar on the test and training data. The results show that performance of the proposed qTV on both sets of test data was consistently good (e.g., 95% agreement with culture-based beach notification decisions during 2019-2020) and was at least as good as its performance on the training data set, supporting its use as an equivalent value to the state standard.",

    "abstract": "The ability to distinguish imported cases from locally acquired cases has important consequences for the selection of public health control strategies. Genomic data can be useful for this, for example using a phylogeographic analysis in which genomic data from multiple locations is compared to determine likely migration events between locations. However, these methods typically require good samples of genomes from all locations, which is rarely available. Here we propose an alternative approach that only uses genomic data from a location of interest. By comparing each new case with previous cases from the same location we are able to detect imported cases, as they have a different genealogical distribution than that of locally acquired cases. We show that, when variations in the size of the local population are accounted for, our method has good sensitivity and excellent specificity for the detection of imports. We applied our method to data simulated under the structured coalescent model and demonstrate relatively good performance even when the local population has the same size as the external population. Finally, we applied our method to several recent genomic datasets from both bacterial and viral pathogens, and show that it can, in a matter of seconds or minutes, deliver important insights on the number of imports to a geographically limited sample of a pathogen population.",

    "abstract": "While early genetic and low resolution structural observations suggested that extracellular conductive filaments on metal reducing organisms such as Geobacter were composed of Type IV pili, it has now been established that bacterial c-type cytochromes can polymerize to form extracellular filaments capable of long-range electron transport. Atomic structures exist for two such cytochrome filaments, formed from the hexaheme cytochrome OmcS and the tetraheme cytochrome OmcE. Due to the highly conserved heme packing within the central OmcS and OmcE cores, and shared pattern of heme coordination between subunits, it has been suggested that these polymers have a common origin. We have now used cryo-EM to determine the structure of a third extracellular filament, formed from the Geobacter sulfurreducens octaheme cytochrome, OmcZ. In contrast to the linear heme chains in OmcS and OmcE, the packing of hemes, heme:heme angles, and between-subunit heme coordination is quite different in OmcZ. A branched heme arrangement within OmcZ leads to a highly surface exposed heme in every subunit, which may account for the formation of conductive biofilm networks, and explain the higher measured conductivity of OmcZ filaments. This new structural evidence suggests that conductive cytochrome polymers arose independently on more than one occasion from different ancestral multiheme proteins.",
