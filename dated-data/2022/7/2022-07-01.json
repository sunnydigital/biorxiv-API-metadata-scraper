    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWJapanese eels (Anguilla japonica) are commercially important species that have been harvested extensively for foods. Currently, this and related species (American and European eels) are difficult to breed on a commercial basis. Wild stock is used for aquaculture. Due to pollution, overfishing, and international trafficking, eel populations are declining. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists Japanese eels as critically endangered and on its red list. Here we presented a high-quality genome assembly for Japanese eels and demonstrated that large chromosome reorganizations occurred in the events of third-round whole-genome duplications (3R-WRD). Following multiple chromosomal fusion and fission rearrangement, the Anguilla lineage has reduced the haploid chromosomal number of 19 from the ancestral proto-chromosomal number of 25. Phylogenetic analysis of expanded gene families showed the gene families of olfactory receptors and voltage-gated Ca2+-channel expanded significantly. The expansion of olfactory receptors (group {delta} and {zeta} genes) and voltage-gated Ca2+-channel gene families are important for olfaction and neurophysiological functions. Following 3R-WGD, additional tandem (TD) and proximal (PD) duplications occurred to acquire immune-related genes for adaptation. The Japanese eel assembly presented here can be used to study other Anguilla species that are related to evolution and conservation.",

    "abstract": "Autotaxin is primarily known for the formation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). LPA is an important signaling phospholipid that can bind to six G-protein coupled receptors (LPA1-6). The ATX-LPA signaling axis is a critical component in many physiological and pathophysiological conditions. Here, we describe a potent inhibition of {Delta}9-trans-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive compound of medicinal cannabis and related cannabinoids, on the catalysis of two isoforms of ATX with nanomolar EC50 values. Furthermore, we decipher the binding interface of ATX to THC, and its derivative 9(R)-{Delta}6a,10a-THC (6a10aTHC), by X-ray crystallography. Cellular experiments confirm this inhibitory effect, revealing a significant reduction of internalized LPA1 in the presence of THC with simultaneous ATX and LPC stimulation. Our results establish a functional interaction of THC with autotaxin-lysophosphatidic acid signaling and highlight novel aspects of medicinal cannabis therapy.",

    "abstract": "Highly acidic, D/E-rich peptides or proteins are difficult to identify by positive-ion-mode mass spectrometry (MS), and negative-ion-mode MS is an attractive but insufficiently explored alternative. Based on high-resolution and accurate-mass MS analysis of 115 synthetic peptides of 5-28 amino acids, we confirmed that higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) of deprotonated peptides induced abundant backbone or side-chain neutral losses (NL), and updated the ranking list of NLs by abundance. The most abundant fragment ion types are y- > x-, z- > c- if the NL ions are included, or c- > y- > z- > b- if not. The most frequent side-chain NLs involve amino acids C, S, T, D, E, N, Q, and R. Although NL of CO2 is common for all peptides, it is markedly enhanced in D/E-containing peptides. Long peptides and D/E-rich peptides are prone to carrying multiple negative charges. HCD spectra produced from multiply deprotonated peptides have a lower fraction of sequencing ions (i.e., a-, b-, c-, x-, y-, z- ions) than those produced from 1- ([M-H]-) and 2- ([M-2H]2-) precursors. Based on the above findings, we predict that under negative-ion HCD, D/E-rich peptides should be difficult to identify and that choosing a protease to generate peptides containing fewer D/E residues will improve identification of highly acidic proteins.",

    "abstract": "Understanding where in the cytoplasm mRNAs are translated is increasingly recognised as being as important as knowing the timing and level of protein expression. mRNAs are localised via active motor-driven transport along microtubules (MTs) but the underlying essential factors and dynamic interactions are largely unknown. Using biochemical in vitro reconstitutions with purified mammalian proteins, multi-colour TIRF-microscopy (TIRF-M), and interaction kinetics measurements, we show that adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) enables kinesin-1- and kinesin-2-based mRNA transport, and that APC is an ideal adaptor for long-range mRNA transport as it forms highly stable complexes with 3UTR fragments of several neuronal mRNAs (APC-RNPs). The kinesin-1 KIF5A binds and transports several neuronal mRNP components such as FMRP, PUR, and mRNA fragments weakly, whereas the transport frequency of the mRNA fragments is significantly increased by APC. APC-RNP-motor complexes can assemble on MTs, generating highly processive mRNA transport events. We further find that EB1 recruits APC-RNPs to dynamically growing MT ends and APC-RNPs track shrinking MTs, producing MT minus-end-directed RNA motility due to the high dwell times of APC on MTs. Our findings establish APC as a versatile mRNA-kinesin adaptor and a key factor for the assembly and bidirectional movement of neuronal transport mRNPs.",

    "abstract": "The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a protection mechanism against transposons in animal germ cells. Most PIWI proteins possess piRNA-guided endonuclease activity, which is critical for silencing transposons and producing new piRNAs. Gametocyte-specific factor 1 (Gtsf1), an evolutionarily conserved zinc finger protein, promotes catalysis by PIWI proteins. Many animals have multiple Gtsf1 paralogs; however, their respective roles in the piRNA pathway are not fully understood. Here, we dissected the roles of Gtsf1 and its paralog Gtsf1-like (Gtsf1L) in the silkworm piRNA pathway. We found that Gtsf1 and Gtsf1L preferentially bind the two silkworm PIWI paralogs, Siwi and BmAgo3, respectively, and facilitate the endonuclease activity of each PIWI protein. This orthogonal activation effect was further supported by specific reduction of BmAgo3-bound Masculinizer piRNA and Siwi-bound Feminizer piRNA, the unique piRNA pair required for silkworm feminization, upon depletion of Gtsf1 and Gtsf1L, respectively. Our results indicate that the two Gtsf paralogs in silkworms activate their respective PIWI partners, thereby facilitating the amplification of piRNAs.",

In these systems, cardiomyocyte (CM) contractility is an important functional metric, but current measurement methods are inaccurate, low-throughput, or require complex set-ups. To address this need, we developed a standalone non-invasive, label-free ultrasound technique operating at 40-200 MHz to measure the beat rate, beat rhythm, and force of contraction of cardiac models, ranging from single adult CMs to 3D microtissue constructs in standard cell culture formats. The high temporal resolution of 1000 fps resolved the beat profile of single mouse CMs paced at up to 9 Hz, revealing limitations of lower speed optical based measurements to resolve beat kinetics or characterize aberrant beats. Coupling of ultrasound with traction force microscopy enabled the measurement of CM longitudinal modulus and facile estimation of adult mouse CM contractile forces of 2.34 {+/-} 1.40 N, comparable to more complex measurement techniques. Similarly, measurements of beat rate, rhythm, and drug responses of CM spheroid and microtissue models were demonstrated. In conclusion, ultrasound can be used for the rapid characterization of CM contractile function in a wide range of commonly-studied configurations ranging from single cells to 3D tissue constructs using standard well plates, with applications in cardiac drug discovery and cardiotoxicity evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors regulate gene expression by binding to transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Most models for predicting TFBSs are based on position weight matrices (PWMs), which require a specific motif to be present in the DNA sequence and do not consider interdependencies of nucleotides. Novel approaches such as Transcription Factor Flexible Models or recurrent neural networks consequently provide higher accuracies. However, it is unclear whether such approaches can uncover novel non-canonical, hitherto unexpected TFBSs relevant to human transcriptional regulation. In this study, we trained a convolutional recurrent neural network with HT-SELEX data for GRHL1 binding and applied it to a set of GRHL1 binding sites obtained from ChIP-Seq experiments from human cells. We identified 46 non-canonical GRHL1 binding sites, which were not found by a conventional PWM approach. Unexpectedly, some of the newly predicted binding sequences lacked the CNNG core motif, so far considered obligatory for GRHL1 binding. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, we experimentally confirmed binding between the GRHL1-DNA binding domain and predicted GRHL1 binding sites, including a non-canonical GRHL1 binding site. Mutagenesis of individual nucleotides revealed a correlation between predicted binding strength and experimentally validated binding affinity across representative sequences. This correlation was neither observed with a PWM-based nor another deep learning approach. Our results show that convolutional recurrent neural networks may uncover unanticipated binding sites and facilitate quantitative transcription factor binding predictions.",

Single-cell transcriptomic analysis of tumor cells from the primary tumors revealed a distinct transcriptional signature that was predictive of metastatic potential and patient survival. Analysis of supporting stromal cells within the tumor environment demonstrated vascular remodeling within the endothelial cells and a proliferative signature within the fibroblasts that was associated with poor survival. An in silico cell-to-cell interaction analysis highlighted the CXCL9/CXCL10-CXCR3 axis and the CD70-CD27 axis as potential therapeutic targets.

Here, we analyzed the effects of an immunotherapeutic agent, the IL-15 superagonist N-803, on MAIT cell activation, trafficking, and cytolytic function in macaques. We found that N-803 could activate MAIT cells in vitro and increase their ability to produce IFN{gamma} in response to bacterial stimulation. To expand upon this, we examined the phenotypes and function of MAIT cells present in samples collected from PBMC, airways (BAL), and lymph nodes (LN) from rhesus macaques that were treated in vivo with N-803. N-803 treatment led to a transient 6-7 fold decrease in the total number of MAIT cells in the peripheral blood relative to pre N-803 timepoints. Concurrent with the decrease in cells in the peripheral blood, we observed a rapid decline in the frequency of CXCR3+CCR6+ MAITs. This corresponded with an increase in the frequency of CCR6+ MAITs in BAL, and higher frequencies of ki-67+ and granzyme B+ MAITs in blood, LN, and BAL. Finally, N-803 improved the ability of MAIT cells collected from PBMC and airways to produce IFN{gamma} in response to bacterial stimulation. Overall, N-803 shows the potential to transiently alter the trafficking and enhance the antibacterial activity of MAIT cells which could be combined with other strategies to combat bacterial infections.",

The role of the microbiome in weight gain in avian hosts is unresolved, but there is substantial evidence to support the hypothesis that the microbiome is involved with host weight from mammalian microbiome literature. Here, we collected 100 fecal samples of Ruddy Turnstones to investigate microbiome composition and function during stopover weight gain in Delaware Bay, USA. Using 16S rRNA sequencing on 90 of these samples and metatranscriptomic sequencing on 22, we show that taxonomic composition of the microbiome shifts during weight gain, as do functional aspects of the metatranscriptome. We identified ten genes that are associated with weight class and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis in the microbiota is significantly increasing as birds gain weight. Our results support that the microbiome is a dynamic feature of host biology that interacts with both the host and the environment and may be involved in the rapid weight gain of shorebirds.",

    "abstract": "Tricarboxylates such as citrate are the preferred carbon sources for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic human infections. However, the membrane transport process for the TCA cycle intermediates citrate and cis-aconitate is poorly characterized. Transport is thought to be controlled by the TctDE two-component system, which mediates transcription of the putative major transporter OpdH. Loss of tctDE has been associated with sensitization to aminoglycosides, possibly linking tricarboxylate transport to enhanced antimicrobial resistance. In this work, we search for previously unidentified transporters of citrate and cis-aconitate using both protein homology and RNA sequencing approaches. We uncover new transporters and show that OpdH is not the major citrate porin; instead, citrate transport primarily relies on the tripartite TctCBA system, which is encoded in the opdH operon. Deletion of tctA causes a growth lag on citrate and loss of growth on cis-aconitate. Combinatorial deletion of newly discovered transporters can fully block citrate utilization. We then characterize transcriptional control of the opdH operon in tctDE mutants and show that loss of tctD blocks citrate utilization due to its inability to express opdH-tctCBA. However, tctE and tctDE mutants evolve heritable adaptations that restore growth on citrate as the sole carbon source.\n\nAuthor SummaryPseudomonas aeruginosa is a bacterium that infects hospitalized patients and is often highly resistant to antibiotic treatment. It preferentially uses small organic acids called tricarboxylates rather than sugars as a source of carbon for growth. The transport of many of these molecules from outside the cell to the interior occurs through unknown channels. In some cases, there may be links between antibiotic uptake and the transport of metabolic molecules, making cross-membrane transport medically important. In this work we examined how the tricarboxylates citrate and cis-aconitate are transported in P. aeruginosa. We then sought to understand how production of proteins that permit citrate and cis-aconitate transport is regulated by a signaling system called TctDE. We identified new transporters for these molecules, clarified the function of a known transport system, and directly tied transporter expression to the presence of an intact TctDE system.",

Growth is usually assumed to occur by cellular replication, despite microorganisms capacity to increase biomass by synthesizing storage compounds.

Together these compounds accounted for 19.1 {+/-} 1.7% to 46.4 {+/-} 8.0% of extractable soil microbial biomass, and revealed up to 279 {+/-} 72% more biomass growth than observed by a DNA-based method alone. Even under C limitation, storage represented an additional 16 - 96% incorporation of added C into microbial biomass. These findings encourage greater recognition of storage synthesis and degradation as key pathways of biomass change and as mechanisms underlying resistance and resilience of microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke, caused by vessel blockage, results in cerebral infarction; the death of brain tissue. Previously, quantitative trait locus mapping (QTL) of cerebral infarct volume and collateral vessel number identified a single, strong genetic locus regulating both phenotypes. Additional studies identified the causative gene, encoding RAB GTPase Binding Effector Protein 2 (Rabep2). However, there is yet no evidence that variation in the human ortholog of this gene plays any role in ischemic stroke outcomes. We established an in vivo evaluation platform in mice using adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene replacement and verified that both mouse and human RABEP2 rescue the mouse Rabep2 KO ischemic stroke volume and collateral vessel phenotypes. Importantly, this cross-species complementation enabled us to experimentally investigate the functional effects of coding sequence variation in the human RABEP2 gene. We chose four coding variants from the human population that are predicted by multiple in silico algorithms to be damaging to RABEP2 function. In vitro and in vivo analyses verify that all four led to decreased collateral vessel connections and increased infarct volume. Thus, there are naturally occurring loss-of-function alleles. This cross-species approach will expand the number of targets for therapeutics development for ischemic stroke.",

    "abstract": "Gaining insight into the genetic regulation of gene expression in human brain is key to the interpretation of genome-wide association studies for major neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses have largely been used to achieve this, providing valuable insights into the genetic regulation of steady-state RNA in human brain, but not distinguishing between molecular processes regulating transcription and stability. RNA quantification within cellular fractions can disentangle these processes in cell types and tissues which are challenging to model in vitro. We investigated the underlying molecular processes driving the genetic regulation of gene expression specific to a cellular fraction using allele-specific expression (ASE). Applying ASE analysis to genomic and transcriptomic data from paired nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of anterior prefrontal cortex, cerebellar cortex and putamen tissues from 4 post-mortem neuropathologically-confirmed control human brains, we demonstrate that a significant proportion of genetic regulation of gene expression occurs post-transcriptionally in the cytoplasm, with genes undergoing this form of regulation more likely to be synaptic. These findings have implications for understanding the structure of gene expression regulation in human brain, and importantly the interpretation of rapidly growing single-nucleus brain RNA-sequencing and eQTL datasets, where cytoplasm-specific regulatory events could be missed.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) holoenzymes target broad substrates by recognizing short motifs via regulatory subunits. PP2A methylesterase 1 (PME-1) is a cancer-promoting enzyme and undergoes methylesterase activation upon binding to the PP2A core enzyme. Here we showed that PME-1 readily demethylates different families of PP2A holoenzymes and blocks substrate recognition in vitro. The high-resolution cryo-EM structure of a PP2A-B56 holoenzyme-PME-1 complex reveals that PME-1 disordered regions, including a substrate-mimicking motif, tether to the B56 regulatory subunit at remote sites. They occupy the holoenzyme substrate-binding groove and allow large structural shifts in both holoenzyme and PME-1 to enable multi-partite contacts at structured cores to activate the methylesterase. B56-interface mutations selectively block PME-1 activity toward PP2A-B56 holoenzymes and affect the methylation of a fraction of total cellular PP2A. The B56-interface mutations allow us to uncover B56-specific PME-1 functions in p53 signaling. Our studies reveal multiple mechanisms of PME-1 in suppressing holoenzyme functions and versatile PME-1 activities derived from coupling substrate-mimicking motifs to dynamic structured cores.",

    "abstract": "The lipid molecule phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) controls all aspects of plasma membrane (PM) function in animal cells, from its selective permeability to the attachment of the cytoskeleton. Although disruption of PI(4,5)P2 is associated with a wide range of diseases, it remains unclear how cells sense and maintain PI(4,5)P2 levels to support various cell functions. Here, we show that the PIP4K family of enzymes that synthesize PI(4,5)P2 via a minor pathway, also function as sensors of tonic PI(4,5)P2 levels. PIP4Ks are recruited to the PM by elevated PI(4,5)P2 levels, where they inhibit the major PI(4,5)P2-synthesizing PIP5Ks. Perturbation of this simple homeostatic mechanism reveals differential sensitivity of PI(4,5)P2-dependent signaling to elevated PI(4,5)P2 levels. These findings reveal that a subset of PI(4,5)P2-driven functions may drive disease associated with disrupted PI(4,5)P2 homeostasis.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryThe enzyme PIP4K functions as both a sensor and negative regulator of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis by the closely related PIP5K enzymes, tuning the activity of numerous membrane functions.",
