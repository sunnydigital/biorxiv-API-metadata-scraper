    "abstract": "Hyphessobrycon is one of the most species rich and widely distributed genera in the family Characidae, with more than 160 species ranging from Veracruz, Mexico to Argentina. The majority of the diversity of Hyphessobrycon shows a cis-Andean distribution; only nine species are trans-Andean including H. compressus (Meek 1908). It is well established that Hyphessobrycon is not monophyletic but has been suggested that natural groups can be identified within the larger Hyphessobrycon species group. In this study, we test the monophyly of trans-Andean species of Hyphessobrycon and investigate the placement of H. compressus. We have inferred the first phylogenomic hypothesis of trans-Andean Hyphessobrycon that includes nearly complete taxonomic sampling (eight of nine valid species) using ultraconserved elements (UCEs). We analyzed 75% (1682 UCEs), 90% (1258 UCEs), and 95% (838 UCEs) complete data matrices, and inferred phylogenomic hypotheses under concatenation and coalescent approaches. In all cases, we recovered the monophyly of trans-Andean Hyphessobrycon inclusive of H. compressus, and strong support for three species groups and evidence of cryptic diversity within the widespread H. compressus and H. condotensis. We used our phylogenomic hypothesis to investigate the biogeographic history of Hyphessobrycon in Middle America. Our ancestral range estimation analysis suggests a single event of cis- to trans-Andean colonization followed by stepwise colonization from the Pacific slope of northwestern South America (Choco block) to northern Middle America (Maya block). Our work supports the recognition of the trans-Andean species as Hyphessobrycon sensu stricto and provides a robust evolutionary template to examine morphological characters that will allow us to better understand the diversity of Hyphessobrycon in Middle America.",

    "abstract": "One strategy to electrically stimulate nerves utilizes the interference of multiple high frequency waveforms. This technique has recently gained significant attention as a method to improve the state-of-the-art in neurostimulation. Here we report our investigation into the fundamental properties of the neuronal response to these types of waveforms. Our data suggest, contrary to the currently accepted explanation, that neurons do not extract envelopes at all, and that the response to these signals is well explained by a resistor-capacitor (i.e., integrator) membrane with a fixed firing threshold. This new understanding of the fundamental mechanism of interferential neural stimulation changes how we should model and evaluate the safety and efficacy of these signals. Utilizing this new understanding, we develop several novel interferential stimulation techniques. Interferential strategies demonstrate promising results and may improve many neuromodulation therapies.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) and its related diseases, including obesity and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), have become a public health issue due to their increasing prevalence. Polyphenols, such as grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE), are bioactive compounds present in fruits and vegetables that show promise for MS treatment. We have previously demonstrated that the efficacy of this phenolic extract in the modulation of liver circadian clocks was affected by the time of the day at which it was ingested. Thus, we wondered if the beneficial effects of GSPE consumption in NAFLD could be mediated by diurnal modulation of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism and whether GSPE effects on liver metabolism are impacted by the timing of administration. Results from hepatic lipid profiling, expression rhythm analysis of metabolic genes together with liver metabolomics in rats revealed that the CAF diet impaired glucose homeostasis and enhanced lipogenesis in the liver, leading to the generation of hepatosteatosis. Chronic consumption of GSPE at the onset of the active phase was able to restore the daily oscillation of liver mass and of key lipogenic and glycogenic genes, along with the reestablishment of liver metabolite rhythms, demonstrating hepatoprotective properties by decreasing triglyceride accumulation and lipid droplet formation in the liver, thus mitigating the development of CAF-induced NAFLD. Furthermore, in vitro data suggest that catechin, one of the main phenolic compounds found in the GSPE extract, may be involved in the ameliorating effects of GSPE against NAFLD.",

    "abstract": "Pleiotropy - when a single gene controls two or more seemingly unrelated traits - has been shown to impact genes with effects on flowering time, leaf architecture, and inflorescence morphology in maize. However, the genome-wide impact of true biological pleiotropy across all maize phenotypes is largely unknown. Here we investigate the extent to which biological pleiotropy impacts phenotypes within maize through GWAS summary statistics reanalyzed from previously published metabolite, field, and expression phenotypes across the Nested Association Mapping population and Goodman Association Panel. Through phenotypic saturation of 120,597 traits, we obtain over 480 million significant quantitative trait nucleotides. We estimate that only 1.56-32.3% of intervals show some degree of pleiotropy. We then assessed the relationship between pleiotropy and various biological features such as gene expression, chromatin accessibility, sequence conservation, and enrichment for gene ontology terms. We find very little relationship between pleiotropy and these variables when compared to permuted pleiotropy. We hypothesize that biological pleiotropy of common alleles is not widespread in maize and is highly impacted by nuisance terms such as population structure and linkage disequilibrium. Natural selection on large standing natural variation in maize populations may target wide- and large-effect variants, leaving the prevalence of detectable pleiotropy relatively low.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe genetic basis of complex traits has been thought to exhibit pleiotropy, which is the notion that a single locus can control two or more unrelated traits. Widespread reports in the human disease literature show genomic signatures of pleiotropic loci across many traits. However, little is known about the prevalence and behavior of pleiotropy in maize across a large number of phenotypes. Using association mapping of common alleles in over one hundred thousand traits, we determine how pleiotropic each region was and use these quantitative scores to functionally characterize each region of the genome. Our results show little evidence that pleiotropy is a common phenomenon in maize. We observed that maize does not exhibit the same pleiotropic characteristics as human diseases in terms of prevalence, gene expression, chromatin accessibility, or sequence conservation. Rather than pervasive pleiotropy, we hypothesize that strong selection on large and wide effect loci and the need for trait independence at the gene level keep the prevalence of pleiotropy low, thus, allowing for the adaptation of maize varieties to novel environments and conditions.",

In order to exploit this knowledge base, researchers target individual neurons and study their function. Therefore, vast libraries of fly driver lines expressing fluorescent reporter genes in sets of neurons have been created and imaged using confocal light microscopy (LM). However, creating a fly line for driving gene expression within a single neuron found in the EM connectome remains a challenge, as it typically requires identifying a pair of fly lines where only the neuron of interest is expressed in both.

    "abstract": "IntroductionDeep brain stimulation (DBS) is a common treatment for a variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Recent studies have highlighted the role of neuroimaging in localizing the position of electrode contacts relative to target brain areas in order to optimize DBS programming. Among different imaging methods, postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for DBS electrode localization; however, the geometrical distortion induced by the lead limits its accuracy. In this work, we investigated to what degree the difference between the actual location of the leads tip and the location of the tip estimated from the MRI artifact varies depending on the MRI sequence parameters such as acquisition plane and phase encoding direction, as well as the leads extracranial configuration. Accordingly, an imaging technique to increase the accuracy of lead localization was devised and discussed.\n\nMethodsWe designed and constructed an anthropomorphic phantom with an implanted DBS system following 18 clinically relevant configurations. The phantom was scanned at a Siemens 1.5 Tesla Aera scanner using a T1MPRAGE sequence optimized for clinical use and a T1TSE sequence optimized for research purposes. We varied slice acquisition plane and phase encoding direction and calculated the distance between the caudal tip of the DBS lead MRI artifact and the actual tip of the lead, as estimated from MRI reference markers.\n\nResultsImaging parameters and lead configuration substantially altered the difference in the depth of the lead within its MRI artifact on the scale of several millimeters - with a difference as large as 4.99 millimeters. The actual tip of the DBS lead was found to be consistently more rostral than the tip estimated from the MR image artifact. The smallest difference between the tip of the DBS lead and the tip of the MRI artifact using the clinically relevant sequence (i.e., T1MPRAGE) was found with the sagittal acquisition plane and anterior-posterior phase encoding direction.\n\nDiscussion/ConclusionThe actual tip of an implanted DBS lead is located up to several millimeters rostral to the tip of the leads artifact on postoperative MR images. This distance depends on the MRI sequence parameters and the DBS systems extracranial trajectory. MRI parameters may be altered to improve this localization.",

    "abstract": "AimsEpigenetic clocks are widely applied as surrogates for biological age in different tissues and/or diseases, including several neurodegenerative diseases. Despite white matter (WM) changes often being observed in neurodegenerative diseases, no study has investigated epigenetic ageing in white matter.\n\nMethodsWe analysed the performances of two DNA methylation-based clocks, DNAmClockMulti and DNAmClockCortical, in post-mortem WM tissue from multiple subcortical regions and the cerebellum, and in oligodendrocyte-enriched nuclei. We also examined epigenetic ageing in control and multiple system atrophy (MSA) (WM and mixed WM and grey matter), as MSA is a neurodegenerative disease comprising pronounced WM changes and -synuclein aggregates in oligodendrocytes.\n\nResultsEstimated DNA methylation (DNAm) ages showed strong correlations with chronological ages, even in WM (e.g., DNAmClockCortical, r = [0.80-0.97], p<0.05). However, performances and DNAm age estimates differed between clocks and brain regions. DNAmClockMulti significantly underestimated ages in all cohorts except in the MSA prefrontal cortex mixed tissue, whereas DNAmClockCortica tended towards age overestimations. Pronounced age overestimations in the oligodendrocyte-enriched cohorts (e.g., oligodendrocyte-enriched nuclei, p=6.1x10-5) suggested that this cell-type ages faster. Indeed, significant positive correlations were observed between estimated oligodendrocyte proportions and DNAm age acceleration estimated by DNAmClockCortica (r>0.31, p<0.05), and similar trends with DNAmClockMulti. Although increased age acceleration was observed in MSA compared to controls, no significant differences were observed upon adjustment for possible confounders (e.g., cell-type proportions).\n\nConclusionsOur findings show that oligodendrocyte proportions positively influence epigenetic age acceleration across brain regions and highlight the need to further investigate this in ageing and neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders are thought to initiate focally and then spread over time through neural circuits. A mechanism that has been proposed to explain this is the inter-cellular movement of misfolded \"prion-like\" proteins that then recruit normally folded proteins in recipient cells to also adopt pathological conformations. Such a mechanism has been proposed, for example, to explain the propagation of abnormally phosphorylated cytoplasmic inclusions of TAR-DNA-Binding protein (TDP-43) during the progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). But unlike transmissible prion diseases such as mad cow disease, which can be caused by ingestion or by injection into animal brains of misfolded PrP, ALS and FTD are not infectious and the injection of phosphorylated and aggregated TDP-43 protein into rodent brains is not sufficient to cause disease phenotypes unless those animals also express high levels of transgenic TDP-43 protein. This suggests a missing component of a positive feedback that is necessary to sustain disease progression. We provide evidence that endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are that missing component. We demonstrate that ERV expression and TDP-43 proteinopathy are mutually reinforcing. Expression of either the Drosophila ERV, gypsy (mdg4) or the human ERV, HERV-K (HML-2) are each sufficient to stimulate cytoplasmic aggregation of human TDP-43. Importantly. We also demonstrate that viral ERV transmission causes propagation of such TDP-43 pathology to cells that express physiological levels of TDP-43, whether they are in contact or at a distance. This mechanism underlies the toxicity of glial cells to neurons and other glia in a Drosophila in vivo model.",

    "abstract": "We describe a blood test that exploits differences in the abundance of diagnostic miRNA biomarkers associated with prion infections in cervids. Using sera from 93 pen-raised white-tailed deer euthanized after unintentional exposure to Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD), quantification of candidate reference and diagnostic miRNAs revealed sensitivity of the q-RT-PCR method to interference from sample degradation, requiring exclusion of 60 specimens that exhibited excessive hemolysis or yielded poor amplification of reference or diagnostic miRNAs. Subsequent quantification of three potentially diagnostic and two control miRNAs in the 33 remaining, minimally degraded sera established diagnostic criteria congruent (100% sensitivity, 92.3% specificity, 93.9% accuracy) with results from standard CWD diagnosis by microscopic detection of immunoreactivity in obex and/or medial retropharyngeal lymph nodes (conducted by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory, NVSL, Ames, IA). Overall, the miRNA assay proved to be at least as accurate and sensitive as other CWD testing alternatives to immunohistochemical diagnosis, albeit supported by data from relatively few animals owing to the challenge of acquiring usable specimens from animals euthanized in a mass depopulation. Nevertheless, for sera acquired antemortem, this biomarker-based test may represent a useful new resource for managing spread of CWD that offers the advantages of being rapid, sensitive, non-invasive, and amenable to high throughput scaling.",

    "abstract": "During tendon healing, macrophages are thought to be a key mediator of scar tissue formation, which prevents successful functional restoration of the tendon. However, macrophages are critical for successful tendon healing as they aid in wound debridement, extracellular matrix deposition, and promote fibroblast proliferation. Recent work has sought to better define the multi-faceted functions of macrophages using depletion studies, while other studies have identified a tendon resident macrophage population. To begin to delineate the functions of tendon-resident versus circulation-derived macrophages, we examined the tendon healing phenotype in Chemokine Receptor 2 (CCR2) reporter (CCR2GFP/+), and knockout mice. CCR2 is a chemokine receptor primarily found on the surface of circulating bone marrow derived monocytes, with CCR2 being an important mediator of macrophage recruitment to wound environments. Surprisingly, CCR2GFP/+ cells were present in the tendon during adult homeostasis, and single cell RNA sequencing identified these cells as tendon-resident macrophages and T cells. During both homeostasis and healing, CCR2 knockout resulted in a substantial decrease in CCR2GFP+ cells and pan-macrophages. Additionally, loss of CCR2 resulted in reduced numbers of myofibroblasts and impeded functional recovery during late healing. This study highlights the heterogeneity of tendon-resident and recruited immune cells and their contributions following injury, and establishes an important role for CCR2 in modulating both the adult tendon cell environment and tendon healing process.",

Here, we determine the spatial resolution of eDNA in dendritic freshwater networks that are typical of aquatic habitats. Our intensive sampling campaign comprised over 430 eDNA samples across 21 connected lakes, allowing us to analyse detections at a variety of scales, from different habitats within a lake to entire lake networks. We found strong signals of within-lake variation in eDNA distribution reflective of typical habitat use by both fish and zooplankton. Most importantly, we also found that connecting channels between lakes resulted in an accumulation of downstream eDNA detections in lakes with a higher number of inflows, and as networks increased in length. These findings have profound implications for the interpretation of eDNA detections in aquatic ecosystems in global-scale biodiversity monitoring observations.",

    "abstract": "In group-living species, evolution puts a premium on the ability of individuals to track the state, whereabouts, and interactions of others. The value of social information might vary with the degree of competition within and between groups, however. We investigated male monitoring of female location in wild Guinea baboons (Papio papio). Guinea baboons live in socially tolerant multi-level societies with one-male-units comprising 1-6 females and young at the core. Using field playback experiments, we first tested whether male Guinea baboons (N=14) responded more strongly to playbacks of associated vs. non-associated females, which was the case. In the second and core experiment, we tested whether males (N=22 males, N=62 trials) keep track of the whereabouts of associated females by playing back unit females calls from locations that were either consistent or inconsistent with the actual position of the female. Contrary to predictions, males responded equally strongly in both conditions. While males seem to recognize their females by voice, they might lack the attention or motivation to track their females movement patterns. These results reinforce the view that the value of social information may vary substantially with the distribution of power in a society. While highly competitive regimes necessitate high attention to deviations from expected patterns, egalitarian societies allow for a certain degree of obliviousness.",

    "abstract": "The question how proteins fold is especially pointed for large multidomain, multispanning membrane proteins with complex topologies. We have uncovered the sequence of events that encompass proper folding of the ABC transporter CFTR in live cells, by combining kinetic radiolabeling with protease-susceptibility assays. We found that CFTR folds in two clearly distinct stages. The first, co-translational, stage involves folding of the 2 transmembrane domains TMD1 and TMD2, plus one nucleotide-binding domain, NBD1. The second stage is a simultaneous, post-translational increase in protease resistance for both TMDs and NBD2 caused by assembly of these domains onto NBD1.\n\nOur technology probes every 2-3 residues (on average) in CFTR. This in-depth analysis at amino-acid level allows detailed analysis of domain folding and importantly also the next level: the assembly of the domains to native, folded CFTR. Defects and changes brought about by medicines, chaperones or mutations also are amenable to analysis. We here show that the DXD motif in NBD1 that was identified to be required for export of CFTR from the ER turned out to be required for proper domain folding and assembly instead, upstream of transport. CFTR mutated in this motif phenocopies the misfolding and degradation of the well-known disease-causing mutant F508del that established cystic fibrosis as protein-folding disease. The highly modular process of domain folding and stepwise domain assembly explains the relatively high fidelity of folding and the importance of a step-wise folding process for such complex proteins.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of global mortality and morbidity. Cardiac dysrhythmias contribute significantly to this disease burden. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common chronic dysrhythmia. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived atrial cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-AMs) present an exciting new model for AF but currently fail to reach maturity and so are limited in translational potential currently. We report a new approach using a combination of Gremlin 2 and retinoic acid treatment of human iPSCs for generating cardiomyocytes resembling atrial cells. More than 40% of myocytes generated by this approach showed rod-shaped morphology, expression of cardiomyocyte proteins (including RyR2 receptors, a-actinin-2, F-actin) and typically a striated appearance, all of which were broadly similar to the characteristics of adult atrial myocytes. Isolated myocytes were electrically quiescent until stimulated to fire action potentials with an atrial myocyte profile and an amplitude of approximately 100 mV, arising from a resting potential of approximately -70 mV. Single-cell RNA sequence (scRNASeq) analysis showed a high level of expression of several atrial specific transcripts including NPPA, MYL7, HOXA3, SLN, KCNJ4, KCNJ5 and KCNA5. Amplitudes of calcium transients recorded from spontaneously beating cultures were increased by the stimulation of -adrenoceptors (activated by phenylephrine and blocked by prazosin) or {beta}-adrenoceptors (activated by isoproterenol and blocked by CGP20712A). Thus, our new method provides an efficient approach for differentiating human atrial myocytes with mature characteristics from hiPSCs. This preparation will be very useful for studying signalling pathways in human atrial myocytes, and provides a valuable model for investigating atrial fibrillation and drug discovery.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs genome sequencing becomes a more integral part of scientific research, government policy, and personalized medicine, the primary challenge for researchers is shifting from generating raw data to analyzing these vast datasets. Although much work has been done to reduce compute times using various configurations of traditional CPU computing infrastructures, Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) offer the opportunity to accelerate genomic workflows by several orders of magnitude. Here we benchmark one GPU-accelerated software suite called NVIDIA Parabricks on Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and an NVIDIA DGX cluster. We benchmarked six variant calling pipelines, including two germline callers (HaplotypeCaller and DeepVariant) and four somatic callers (Mutect2, Muse, LoFreq, SomaticSniper).\n\nResultsFor germline callers, we achieved up to 65x acceleration, bringing HaplotypeCaller runtime down from 36 hours to 33 minutes on AWS, 35 minutes on GCP, and 24 minutes on the NVIDIA DGX. Somatic callers exhibited more variation between the number of GPUs and computing platforms. On cloud platforms, GPU-accelerated germline callers resulted in cost savings compared with CPU runs, whereas somatic callers were often more expensive than CPU runs because their GPU acceleration was not sufficient to overcome the increased GPU cost.\n\nConclusionsGermline variant callers scaled with the number of GPUs across platforms, whereas somatic variant callers exhibited more variation in the number of GPUs with the fastest runtimes, suggesting that these workflows are less GPU optimized and require benchmarking on the platform of choice before being deployed at production scales. Our study demonstrates that GPUs can be used to greatly accelerate genomic workflows, thus bringing closer to grasp urgent societal advances in the areas of biosurveillance and personalized medicine.",

Over the last decade, the HPO has been used to accelerate the implementation of precision medicine into clinical practice. In addition, recent research in representation learning, specifically in graph embedding, has led to notable progress in automated prediction via learned features. Here, we present a novel approach to phenotype representation by incorporating phenotypic frequencies based on 53 million full-text health care notes from more than 1.5 million individuals. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed phenotype embedding technique by comparing our work to existing phenotypic similarity-measuring methods. Using phenotype frequencies in our embedding technique, we are able to identify phenotypic similarities that surpass the current computational models. In addition, we show that our embedding technique aligns with domain experts judgment at a level that exceeds their agreement. We show that our proposed technique efficiently represents complex and multidimensional phenotypes in HPO format, which can then be used as input for various downstream tasks that require deep phenotyping, including patient similarity analyses and disease trajectory prediction.",

    "abstract": "Superficial white matter (SWM) represents a significantly understudied part of the human brain, despite comprising a large portion of brain volume and making up a majority of cortical structural connections. Using multiple, high-quality, datasets with large sample sizes (N=2421, age range 5-100) in combination with methodological advances in tractography, we quantified features of SWM volume and thickness across the brain and across the lifespan. We address four questions: (1) How does U-fiber volume change with age? (2) What does U-fiber thickness look like across the brain? (3) How does SWM thickness change with age? (4) Are there relationships between SWM thickness and cortical features? Our main findings are that (1) SWM volume shows unique volumetric trajectories with age that are distinct from gray matter and other white matter trajectories; (2) SWM thickness varies across the brain, with patterns robust across individuals and across the population at the region-level and vertex-level; (3) SWM shows nonlinear changes across the lifespan that vary across regions; and (4) SWM thickness is associated with cortical thickness and curvature. For the first time, we show that SWM volume follows a similar trend as overall white matter volume, peaking at a similar time in adolescence, leveling off throughout adulthood, and decreasing with age thereafter. Notably, the relative fraction of total brain volume of SWM continuously increases with age, and consequently takes up a larger proportion of total white matter volume, unlike the other tissue types that decrease with respect to total brain volume. This study represents the first characterization of SWM features across the lifespan and provides the background for characterizing normal aging and insight into the mechanisms associated with SWM development and decline.",

    "abstract": "Most multicellular organisms, including fruit flies, possess an innate immune response, but lack an adaptive immune response. Even without adaptive immunity, \"immune priming\" allows organisms to survive a second infection more effectively after an initial, non-lethal infection. We used Drosophila melanogaster to study the transcriptional program that underlies priming. Using an insect-derived strain of Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis, we found a low dose infection enhances survival of a subsequent high dose infection. The enhanced survival in primed animals does not correlate with a decreased bacterial load, implying that the organisms tolerate, rather than resist the infection. We measured the transcriptome associated with immune priming in the fly immune organs: the fat body and hemocytes. We found many genes that were only upregulated in re-infected flies. In contrast, there are very few genes that either remained transcriptionally active throughout the experiment or more efficiently re-activated upon reinfection. Measurements of priming in immune deficient mutants revealed IMD signaling is largely dispensable for responding to a single infection, but needed to fully prime; while Toll signaling is required to respond to a single infection, but dispensable for priming. Overall, we found a primed immune response to E. faecalis relies on immune tolerance rather than bacterial resistance and drives a unique transcriptional response.",

    "abstract": "Over the past few decades, daily exposure to radiofrequency (RF) fields has been increasing due to the rapid development of wireless and medical imaging technologies. Under extreme circumstances, exposure to very strong RF energy can lead to heating of body tissue, even resulting in tissue injury. The presence of implanted devices, moreover, can amplify RF effects on surrounding tissue. Therefore, it is important to understand the interactions of RF fields with tissue in the presence of implants, in order to establish appropriate wireless safety protocols, and also to extend the benefits of medical imaging to increasing numbers of people with implanted medical devices. This study explored the neurological effects of RF exposure in rodents implanted with neuronal recording electrodes. We exposed freely moving and anesthetized rats and mice to 950 MHz RF energy while monitoring their brain activity, temperature, and behavior. We found that RF exposure could induce fast onset firing of single neurons without heat injury. In addition, brain implants enhanced the effect of RF stimulation resulting in reversible behavioral changes. Using an optical temperature measurement system, we found greater than tenfold increase in brain temperature in the vicinity of the implant. On the one hand, our results underline the importance of careful safety assessment for brain implanted devices, but on the other hand, we also show that metal implants may be used for neurostimulation if brain temperature can be kept within safe limits.",

We performed single-cell RNA-sequencing on these populations and found that previously annotated Adamts2 and Rrad layer 2/3 cell types were enriched when photolabeling for negative or positive prediction error responses respectively. Finally, we validated these results functionally by designing artificial promoters for use in AAV vectors to express genetically encoded calcium indicators.

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are increasingly being analyzed by flow cytometry. Yet, their miniscule size and low refractive index, causes the scatter intensity of most EVs to fall below the detection limit of most flow cytometers. A new class of devices, known as spectral flow analyzers, are becoming standards in cell phenotyping studies. Largely, due to their unique capacity of detecting a vast panel of markers with higher sensitivity for light scatter detection. Another class of devices, known as nano-analyzers, provides high resolution detection of sub-micron sized particles. Here, we aim to compare the EVs phenotyping performance between the Aurora (Cytek) spectral cell analyzer and the NanoFCM (nFCM) nanoflow analyzer. These two devices were specifically chosen given their lead in becoming gold standards in their respective fields. Immune cell-derived EVs remain poorly characterized despite their clinical potentials. We therefore, used B- and T- cell line-derived EVs and donor-matched human biofluid-derived EVs from serum, urine, and saliva in combination with a panel of established immune markers for this comparative study. A comparative evaluation of both cytometry platforms was performed, discussing their potential and suitability for different applications. We found that nFCM can accurately i) analyze small EVs (40 to 200 nm) matching the size accuracy of electron microscopy; ii) measure concentration of single EV particle per volume; iii) identify underrepresented EV marker subsets; and iv) provide co-localization of EV surface markers. We could also show that human sample biofluids have unique EV marker signatures that could have future clinical relevance.",

Second, we develop an improved deep learning method that can be directly applied to 3D SIM data, obviating the need for additional hardware. This procedure results in [~]120 nm isotropic resolution and can be combined with denoising to facilitate volumetric imaging spanning dozens of time points. We demonstrate the potential of these advances by imaging a variety of cellular samples, delineating the nanoscale distribution of vimentin and microtubule filaments, observing the relative positions of caveolar coat proteins and lysosomal markers, and visualizing rich cytoskeletal dynamics within T-cells in the early stages of immune synapse formation.",

There is extensive evidence of phenolological shifts in flowering time over the past 50 years in response to increasing temperatures in temperate regions, but far less is known about tropical regions where seasonality is less temperature driven. We examined historical datasets of flowering patterns in two guilds of ornithophilous plants in the montane cloud forests of Monteverde, Costa Rica in order to identify environmental cues for flowering in nine species of plant that are important resources for hummingbirds. Bimonthly censuses of flower production were used to quantify flower production during two sampling periods:1981-1983, 1986-1991., the species studied here appear to cue flowering patterns to either accumulated drought units or a combination of accumulated drought units and chill units prior to flowering. These results have implications for how tropical cloud forest plants will respond to climate change to the extent that drought and chill patterns are changing with time.",

However, the rarity of these events and the restructuring of diversity that they cause complicate direct comparisons between the current extinction crisis and earlier mass extinctions. Among animals, turtles (Testudinata) are one of few groups which both have a sufficient fossil record and a sufficiently stable ecological importance to enable meaningful comparisons between the end Cretaceous mass extinction and the ongoing extinction event. In this paper we analyze the fossil record of turtles and recover three significant peaks in extinction rate. Two of these are in the Cretaceous, the second of these took place at the Cretaceous-Paleogene transition (K-Pg), reflecting the overall patterns previously reported for many other taxa. The third major extinction event started in the Pliocene and continues until now. This peak only affected terrestrial turtles and started much earlier in Eurasia and Africa lineages than elsewhere. This suggests that it may be linked to co-occurring hominins rather than having been caused by global climate change.",

    "abstract": "The Coorgs, also known as Kodavas, are one of the smallest religious and socio-culturally homogenous communities in the world, currently residing in the state of Karnataka, India. Due to a stark contrast with the surrounding subpopulations, their genetic architecture and population & demographic history have been a matter of debate for long. To better understand the population structure and demographic history of this caste group, we analysed the population, using high-resolution autosomal (n=70) as well uniparentally inherited markers (Y-chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA) (n=144). Our first ever findings elucidate that origin of Coorgs traces back to early or middle Bronze Age. We further found population substructure among Coorgs, which manifested as three distinct clusters in a Principal component analysis. One of these subgroups has undergone a rare and immense amount of population-specific drift but all three eventually admixed, both genetically and socio-culturally. The mtDNA analysis showed 40% South Asian-specific mitochondrial lineages among Coorgs; while the Y-chromosomal analysis revealed predominant presence of Eurasian, Middle-Eastern and Indian-specific haplogroups suggesting male-centric migration and eventual assimilation with local females. Our results for the first time identify these ancient and distinct genealogies that make up the contemporary Coorgs and may explain the socio-cultural differences with their immediate and distant neighbours in the country and the prevalent narrative history. In a wider context, the study also reveals an ancient, yet unknown, Middle Eastern source population that might have contributed to an early west to east migration into India.",

Here, we used single-cell RNA-sequencing of embryoid bodies (EBs) to collect transcriptomic data from over 70 cell types in three humans and three chimpanzees. We found hundreds of genes whose regulation is conserved across cell types, as well as genes whose regulation likely evolves under directional selection in one or a handful of cell types. Using EBs from a human-chimpanzee fused cell line, we also inferred the proportion of inter-species regulatory differences due to changes in cis and trans elements between the species.

    "abstract": "Comparisons of intraspecific genetic diversity across species can reveal the roles of geography, ecology, and life history in shaping biodiversity. The wide availability of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences in open-access databases makes this marker practical for conducting analyses across several species in a common framework, but patterns may not be representative of overall species diversity. Here, we gather new and existing mtDNA sequences and genome-wide nuclear data (genotyping-by-sequencing; GBS) for 30 North American squamate species sampled in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States. We estimated mtDNA nucleotide diversity for two mtDNA genes, COI (22 species alignments; average 16 sequences) and cytb (22 species; average 58 sequences), as well as nuclear heterozygosity and nucleotide diversity from GBS data for 118 individuals (30 species; four individuals and 6,820-44,309 loci per species). We showed that nuclear genomic diversity estimates were highly consistent across individuals for some species, while other species showed large differences depending on the locality sampled. Range size was positively correlated with both cytb diversity (Phylogenetically Independent Contrasts: R2 = 0.31, p = 0.007) and GBS diversity (R2 = 0.21; p = 0.006), while other predictors differed across the top models for each dataset. Mitochondrial and nuclear diversity estimates were not correlated within species, although sampling differences in the data available made these datasets difficult to compare. Further study of mtDNA and nuclear diversity sampled across species ranges is needed to evaluate the roles of geography and life history in structuring diversity across a variety of taxonomic groups.",

    "abstract": "Spheroids, organoids, or highly-dense cell-laden droplets are often used as building blocks for bioprinting, but so far little is known about the spatio-temporal cellular interactions post printing. We present a drop-on-demand approach to study the biological interactions of such building blocks in micrometer dimensions. Droplets (containing approximately 700 cells in 10 nl) of multiple cell types are patterned in a 3D hydrogel matrix with a precision of less than 70 m. It is applied to investigate interactions of cell types relevant for vascularization approaches. We show that a gap of 200 m between droplets containing endothelial cells (HUVECs) and adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) leads to decreased sprouting of HUVECs towards ASCs and increased growth from ASCs towards HUVECs. For mixed aggregates containing both cell types, cellular interconnections of ASCs with up to approximately 0.8 millimeter length and inhibition of HUVEC sprouting are observed. When ASCs are differentiated into smooth muscle cells (SMCs), HUVECs display decreased sprouting towards SMCs in separate aggregates, whereas no cellular interconnections or inhibition of HUVEC sprouting are detected for mixed aggregates. These findings demonstrate that this approach acts as a new tool to investigate cell-cell interactions of different cell types in 3D bioprinted constructs.",

    "abstract": "Codons are the repeats of three nucleic acids in genetic material read during translation. 64 total codons exist at different frequencies known to vary between organisms. Codon usage frequencies (CUFs) have recently been used for phylogenetic classification at different discrimination levels. However, the accuracy of phylogenetic classification and applications of this predictive power are not fully elucidated in the current literature. The goal of this project was two-fold: 1.) To increase the accuracy and depth of phylogenetic classification models using CUFs in literature. 2.) To explore the potential application of identifying open reading frames (ORFs) with CUFs. To increase the accuracy of classification models GridSearchCV, TensorFlow, and keras were used to design an improved Artificial Neural Network than the relevant example in the literature. Commonly used predictors were explored in an ensemble format that performs even better than the improved neural network. To explore a more discriminatory and phylogenetically deep classification K Means was used to look at possible clustering structures in the CUF data. To identify ORFs the codon frequencies of each potential ORF are compared to the frequencies of an organism of choice with a multinomial goodness-of-fit test. With correct optimization, these tests can reject possible ORFs with high confidence. In addition to these goals, the codons were ranked in terms of importance for classification with lasso regression and random forests feature ranking. This not only highlights exciting biology related to tRNA concentrations and the variance thereof, but is also helpful for optimizing the statistical tests for ORF identification.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular phase separation has emerged as an essential mechanism for cellular organization. How cells respond to environmental stimuli in a robust and sensitive manner to build functional condensates at the proper time and location is only starting to be understood. Recently, lipid membranes have been recognized as an important regulatory center for biomolecular condensation. However, how the interplay between the phase behaviors of cellular membranes and surface biopolymers may contribute to the regulation of surface condensation remains to be elucidated. Using simulations and a mean-field theoretical model, we show that two key factors are the membranes tendency to phase separate and the surface polymers ability to reorganize local membrane composition. Surface condensate forms with high sensitivity and selectivity in response to features of biopolymer when positive co-operativity is established between coupled growth of the condensate and local lipid domains. This effect relating the degree of membrane-surface polymer co-operativity and condensate property regulation is shown to be robust by different ways of tuning the co-operativity, such as varying membrane protein obstacle concentration, lipid composition and the affinity between lipid and polymer. The general physical principle emerged from the current analysis may have implications in other biological processes and beyond.",

    "abstract": "The Sar1 GTPase initiates Coat Protein II (COPII)-mediated protein transport by generating membrane curvature at subdomains on the Endoplasmic Reticulum, where it is activated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Sec12. Crystal structures of GDP- and GTP-bound forms of Sar1 suggest that it undergoes a conformational switch in which GTP binding enhances the exposure of an amino-terminal amphipathic helix necessary for efficient membrane penetration. However, key residues in the amino-terminus were not resolved in crystal structures, and experimental studies have suggested that the amino-terminus of Sar1 is solvent-exposed in the absence of membrane, even in the GDP-bound state. Therefore, the molecular mechanism by which GTP binding activates the membrane remodeling activity of Sar1 remains unclear. Using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we compare the membrane binding and curvature generation activities of Sar1 in its GDP- and GTP-bound states. We show that in the GTP-bound state, Sar1 inserts into the membrane with its complete (residues 1-23) amphipathic amino-terminal helix, while Sar1-GDP binds to the membrane only through its first 12 residues. Such differential membrane binding modes translate into significant differences in the protein volume inserted into the membrane. As a result, Sar1-GTP generates positive membrane curvature 10-20 times higher than Sar1-GDP. Dimerization of the GTP-bound form of Sar1 further amplifies curvature generation. Taken together, our results present a detailed molecular mechanism for how the nucleotide-bound state of Sar1 regulates its membrane binding and remodeling activities in a concentration dependent manner, paving the way toward a better understanding COPII-mediated membrane transport.\n\nSignificance StatementAmphipathic helices play established roles in penetrating lipid bilayers to produce local membrane curvature. The degree of curvature generated has been suggested to depend on the penetration depth of the amphipathic helix, its amino acid sequence, and the protein volume inserted into the membrane. However, the relative contributions of each of these factors in membrane bending remain unclear. Using the Sar1 protein monomer bound to different nucleotides (GDP vs. GTP) and its GTP-bound dimeric form as examples, we explicitly show that while the precise amino acid sequence and insertion depth of the amphipathic helix are relevant, the generated membrane curvature is most correlated with the volume of protein insertion into the membrane.",

However, the molecular underpinnings by which PVNOT neurons orchestrate gut-to-brain feeding control remain unclear. Here, we show that mice undergoing selective ablation of PVNOT neurons fail to reduce food intake in response to CCK and develop hyperphagic obesity on chow diet. Notably, exposing wildtype mice to a high-fat/high-sugar (HFHS) diet recapitulates this insensitivity towards CCK, which is linked to diet-induced transcriptional and electrophysiological aberrations specifically in PVNOT neurons. Restoring OT pathways in DIO mice via chemogenetics or polypharmacology sufficiently re-establishes CCKs anorexigenic effects. Lastly, by single-cell profiling, we identify a specialized PVNOT neuronal subpopulation with increased {kappa}-opioid signaling under HFHS diet, which restrains their CCK-evoked activation. In sum, we here document a novel (patho)mechanism by which PVNOT signaling uncouples a gut-brain satiation pathway under obesogenic conditions.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian brain contains numerous neurons distributed across forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain that project axons to the lower spinal cord and work in concert to control movement and achieve homeostasis. Extensive work has mapped the anatomical location of supraspinal cell types and continues to establish specific physiological functions. The patterns of gene expression that typify and distinguish these disparate populations, however, are mostly unknown. Here we combined retrograde labeling of supraspinal cell nuclei with fluorescence activated nuclei sorting and single nuclei RNA sequencing analyses to transcriptionally profile neurons that project axons from the mouse brain to lumbar spinal cord. We identified fourteen transcriptionally distinct cell types and used a combination of established and newly identified marker genes to assign an anatomical location to each. To validate the putative marker genes, we visualized selected transcripts and confirmed selective expression within lumbar-projecting neurons in discrete supraspinal regions. Finally, we illustrate the potential utility of these data by examining the expression of transcription factors that distinguish different supraspinal cell types and by surveying the expression of receptors for growth and guidance cues that may be present in the spinal cord. Collectively these data establish transcriptional differences between anatomically defined supraspinal populations, identify a new set of marker genes of use in future experiments, and provide insight into potential differences in cellular and physiological activity across the supraspinal connectome.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTThe brain communicates with the body through a wide variety of neuronal populations with distinct functions and differential sensitivity to damage and disease. We have employed single nuclei RNA sequencing technology to distinguish patterns of gene expression within a diverse set of neurons that project axons from the mouse brain to the lumbar spinal cord. The results reveal transcriptional differences between populations previously defined on the basis of anatomy, provide new marker genes to facilitate rapid identification of cell type in future work, and suggest distinct responsiveness of different supraspinal populations to external growth and guidance cues.",

    "abstract": "Flagellar motility is critical to natural and many forms of assisted reproduction. The rhythmic beating and wave propagation by the flagellum propels sperm through fluid and enables modulation between penetrative progressive motion, activated side-to-side yaw and hyperactivated movement associated with detachment from epithelial binding. These changes occur in response to the properties of the surrounding fluid environment, biochemical activation state, and physiological ligands, however a parsimonious mechanistic explanation of flagellar beat generation that can explain motility modulation is lacking. In this paper we present the Axonemal Regulation of Curvature, Hysteretic model (ARCH), a curvature control-type model based on switching of active moment by local curvature, embedded within a geometrically nonlinear elastic model of the flagellum exhibiting planar flagellar beats, together with nonlocal viscous fluid dynamics. The biophysical system is parameterised completely by four dimensionless parameter groupings. The effect of parameter variation is explored through computational simulation, revealing beat patterns that are qualitatively representative of penetrative (straight progressive), activated (highly yawing) and hyperactivated (non-progressive) modes. Analysis of the flagellar limit cycles and associated swimming velocity reveals a cusp catastrophe between progressive and non-progressive modes, and hysteresis in the response to changes in critical curvature parameter. Quantitative comparison to experimental data on human sperm exhibiting typical penetrative, activated and hyperactivated beats shows a good fit to the time-average absolute curvature profile along the flagellum, providing evidence that the model is capable of providing a framework for quantitative interpretation of imaging data.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome alignment to the spindle equator is a hallmark of mitosis that is thought to promote chromosome segregation fidelity in metazoans. Yet, chromosome alignment is only indirectly supervised by the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) as a byproduct of chromosome bi-orientation, and the consequences of defective chromosome alignment remain unclear. Here we investigated how human cells respond to chromosome alignment defects of distinct molecular nature by following the fate of live HeLa cells after RNAi-mediated depletion of 120 proteins previously implicated in chromosome alignment. Surprisingly, in all cases, cells frequently entered anaphase after a delay with chronically misaligned chromosomes. Using depletion of key proteins as prototypes for defective chromosome alignment, we show that chronically misaligned chromosomes often satisfy the SAC and directly missegregate. In-depth analysis of specific molecular perturbations that prevent proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments revealed that chronically misaligned chromosomes that missegregate frequently result in micronuclei. Higher-resolution live-cell imaging indicated that, contrary to most anaphase lagging chromosomes that correct and reintegrate the main nuclei, chronically misaligned chromosomes are a strong predictor of micronuclei formation in a cancer cell model of chromosomal instability, but not in normal near-diploid cells. We provide evidence supporting that intrinsic differences in kinetochore-microtubule attachment stability on misaligned chromosomes account for this distinct outcome. Thus, chronically misaligned chromosomes that satisfy the SAC may represent a previously overlooked mechanism driving chromosomal/genomic instability during cancer cell division, and we unveil genetic conditions predisposing for these events.",

    "abstract": "The development of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has revolutionized multiple fields of Biology. The ability to sequence DNA and RNA in an automated, parallel and low-cost approach, was key to boost the applicability and acquisition efficiency of omics resources. In this context, the availability of these tools has become indispensable towards our understanding of biodiversity, deepening our knowledge on the distinct complexity levels, from cells to ecosystems.\n\nIn this study we comprehensively characterised and annotated a whole-body transcriptome of Hediste diversicolor. This annelid worm species belongs to the family Nereididae and inhabits estuarine and lagoon areas on the Atlantic coasts of Europe and North America. Ecologically, this species plays an important role in benthic food webs. The ability of rework sediments through bioturbation activity makes this species essential to the estuarine mechanisms.\n\nHere, we used Illumina next-generation sequencing technology, to sequence a total 105 million (M) paired-end (PE) raw reads and produce the first multi-tissue transcriptome assembly of an adult of H. diversicolor. This transcriptome contains 69,335 transcripts with a N50 transcript length of 2,313 bp and a BUSCO gene completeness of 97.7% and 96% (S: 88.2%; D: 7.8%) in Eukaryota and Metazoa lineage-specific profile libraries. Our findings offer a valuable resource for multiple biological studies using this species.",

    "abstract": "Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are chaperones known for their response to heat stress. While sHSPs have well-characterized roles in heat tolerance, potential roles for sHSPs in desiccation tolerance have not been as thoroughly explored. We identified nine sHSPs from the genome of the tardigrade Hypsibius exemplaris, each containing a conserved alpha-crystallin domain flanked by disordered regions. Many of these sHSPs are highly expressed and in some cases are upregulated during desiccation. We found that tardigrade sHSPs were sufficient to improve desiccation tolerance when expressed in E. coli. Purification and subsequent analysis of two sHSPs, HSP21 and HSP24.6, revealed that these proteins can form large complexes in vitro, similar to oligomeric assemblies documented for other sHSPs. These proteins limited heat-induced aggregation of the model enzyme citrate synthase. Heterologous expression of HSP24.6 improved bacterial heat shock survival, and the protein significantly reduced heat-induced aggregation of soluble bacterial protein. Thus, HSP24.6 likely chaperones against protein aggregation to promote survival of heat stress. Furthermore, HSP21 and HSP24.6 also limited desiccation-induced aggregation and loss of function of citrate synthase. This suggests a mechanism by which tardigrade sHSPs promote desiccation tolerance: by limiting desiccation-induced protein aggregation, thereby maintaining proteostasis and supporting survival. These results suggest that sHSPs, classical chaperones, provide a mechanism of general stress resistance that can also be deployed to support survival during anhydrobiosis.",

We present PerturbNet, a deep generative model for predicting the distribution of cell states induced by unseen chemical or genetic perturbations. Our key innovation is to use high-throughput perturbation response data such as Perturb-Seq to learn a continuous mapping between the space of possible perturbations and the space of possible cell states.\n\nUsing Sci-Plex and LINCS datasets, PerturbNet can accurately predict the distribution of gene expression changes induced by unseen small molecules given only their chemical structures. PerturbNet also accurately predicts gene expression changes induced by shRNA, CRISPRi, or CRISPRa perturbations using a perturbation network trained on gene functional annotations. Furthermore, self-supervised sequence embeddings allow PerturbNet to predict gene expression changes induced by missense mutations. We also use PerturbNet to attribute cell state shifts to specific perturbation features, including atoms and functional gene annotations. Finally, we leverage PerturbNet to design perturbations that achieve a desired cell state distribution. PerturbNet holds great promise for understanding perturbation responses and ultimately designing novel chemical and genetic interventions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundNetwork studies of host-pathogen interactions (HPI) are critical in understanding the mechanisms of pathogenesis. However, accessible HPI data for agriculturally important pathogens are limited. This lack of HPI data impedes network analysis to study agricultural pathogens, for preventing and reducing the severity of diseases of relevance to agriculture.\n\nResultsTo rapidly provide HPIs for a broad range of pathogens, we use an interolog-based approach. This approach uses sequence similarity to transfer known HPIs from better studied host-pathogen pairs and predicts 389,878 HPIs for 23 host-pathogen systems of relevance to US agriculture. Each predicted HPI is qualitatively assessed using co-localization, infection related processes, and interacting domains and this information is provided as a confidence indicator for the prediction. Evaluation of predicted HPIs demonstrates that the host proteins predicted to be involved in pathogen interactions include hubs and bottlenecks in the network, as reported in curated host proteins. Moreover, we demonstrate that the use of the predicted HPIs adds value to network analysis and recapitulates known aspects of host-pathogen biology. Access to the predicted HPIs for these agricultural host-pathogen systems is available via the Host Pathogen Interaction Database (HPIDB, hpidb.igbb.msstate.edu), and can be downloaded in standard MITAB file format for subsequent network analysis.\n\nConclusionsThis core set of interolog-based HPIs will enable animal health researchers to incorporate network analysis into their research and help identify host-pathogen interactions that may be tested and experimentally validated. Moreover, the development of a larger set of experimentally validated HPI will inform future predictions. Our approach of transferring biologically relevant HPIs based on interologs is broadly applicable to many host-microbe systems and can be extended to support network modeling of other pathogens, as well as interactions between non-pathogenic microbes.",

Foxp3+ regulatory T-cells (Treg) are dependent on TCR signals for their differentiation and suppressive function. However, it is not fully known how TCR signalling controls the differentiation of polyclonal CD4 T-cells upon antigen recognition at the single-cell level in vivo. In this study, using Nr4a3-Tocky (Timer-of-cell-kinetics-and-activity), which analyses temporal changes of antigen-reactive T-cells following TCR signalling, we investigated T-cell response to Spike protein fragments (S1a, S1b, S2a, and S2b) upon immunisation. We show that S1a and S2a induced the differentiation of PD1hiCXCR5+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which is related to CD4 T-cell immunogenicity. In contrast, S1b induced CD25hiGITRhiPD-1int Treg, which intermittently received TCR signalling. Using Foxp3-Tocky, which analyses Foxp3 transcriptional dynamics, the S1b-reactive Treg sustained Foxp3 transcription over time, which is a hallmark of activated Treg. Foxp3 fate-mapping showed that the S1b-reactive Treg were derived not from pre-existing thymic Treg, suggesting Foxp3 induction in non-Treg cells. Thus, the current study reveals temporally dynamic differentiation of CD4 T-cells and Treg upon immunisation in the polyclonal TCR repertoire.",

    "abstract": "We present a novel framework facilitating the rapid detection of variants of interest (VOI) and concern (VOC) in a viral multiple sequence alignment (MSA). The framework is purely based on the genomic sequence data, without requiring prior established biological analysis. The frameworks building blocks are sets of co-evolving sites (motifs), identified via co-evolutionary signals within the MSA. Motifs form a weighted simplicial complex, whose vertices are sites that satisfy a certain nucleotide diversity. Higher dimensional simplices are constructed using distances quantifying the co-evolutionary coupling of pairs and in the context of our method maximal motifs manifest as clusters. The framework triggers an alert via a cluster with a significant fraction of newly emerging polymorphic sites. We apply our method to SARS-CoV-2, analyzing all alerts issued from November 2020 through August 2021 with weekly resolution for England, USA, India and South America. Within a week at most a handful of alerts, each of which involving on the order of 10 sites are triggered. Cross referencing alerts with a posteriori knowledge of VOI/VOC-designations and lineages, motif-induced alerts detect VOIs/VOCs rapidly, typically weeks earlier than current methods. We show how motifs provide insight into the organization of the characteristic mutations of a VOI/VOC, organizing them as co-evolving blocks. Finally we study the dependency of the motif reconstruction on metric and clustering method and provide the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of our alert criterion.",

    "abstract": "Flagella are multiprotein complexes whose assembly and positioning requires complex spatiotemporal control. Flagellar assembly is thought to be controlled by several transcriptional tiers, which is mediated through various master regulators. Here, we revisited the regulation of flagellar genes in polarly flagellated gammaproteobacteria by the regulators FlrA, RpoN ({sigma}54) and FliA ({sigma}28) in Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32 at the transcript and protein level. As expected, strict control at both levels occurred for for highly abundant flagellar proteins, including the building blocks for the outer rings, rod, hook and filament. In contrast, a number of regulatory and structural proteins were always present also in the absence of the main regulators. Initiation of flagella assembly and motor activation likely relies on the abundance control of only few structural key components required for formation of the MS- and C-ring and the flagellar type III secrection system. We identified {sigma}70-dependent promoters driving constitutive expression of some flagellar genes including the regulators of flagellar number and positioning, FlhF and FlhG. Reduction of the constitutive expression levels resulted in emergence of hyperflagellation. Thus, basal expression and presence of flagellar proteins is required for proper flagellation, which adds a deeper layer to the regulation of flagellar synthesis and assembly.\n\nSignificanceThe tier-based transcriptional regulation underlying bacterial flagella synthesis is - with certain variations - well-established in various species. Here we show that initiation and proceeding of flagellar synthesis can be simply based on the control of some key components and highly abundant building blocks. We further identified a 'tier zero, a set of constitutively produced flagellar regulators and building blocks, which is required, for example, to maintain the flagellar counter. We expect this not only to apply to our model species Shewanella, but also to other flagella regulation systems in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a food-borne pathogen that causes severe bacterial gastroenteritis, with high rates of hospitalization and mortality. Lm is ubiquitous in soil, water and livestock, and can survive and proliferate at low temperatures. Following oral ingestion of contaminated food, Lm crosses the epithelial through intestinal goblet cells in a mechanism depending on Lm InlA and host E-cadherin. Importantly, human infections typically occur with Lm growing at or below room temperature, which are flagellated and motile. Even though many important human bacterial pathogens are flagellated, little is known regarding the effect of bacterial motility on invasion and immune evasion.\n\nHere, we used complementary imaging and computer modeling approaches to test the hypothesis that bacterial motility helps Lm locate and engage target cells permissive for invasion. Imaging explanted mouse and human intestine, we confirmed that Lm grown at room temperature uses motility to scan the epithelial surface and preferentially attach to target cells. Furthermore, we integrated quantitative parameters from our imaging experiments to construct a versatile \"layered\" cellular Potts model (L-CPM) that simulates host-pathogen dynamics. Simulated data are consistent with the hypothesis that bacterial motility enhances invasion by allowing bacteria to search the epithelial surface for their preferred invasion targets. Indeed, our model consistently predicts that motile bacteria have invaded [~]2-fold more at the 1-hour mark. This invasion advantage persists even in the presence of host phagocytes, with the balance between invasion and phagocytosis governed almost entirely by bacterial motility.\n\nIn conclusion, our simulations provide insight into host pathogen interactions and challenge fundamental assumptions regarding how phagocytes might limit bacterial invasion early during infection.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) morphogenesis is characterized by a large over-production of subviral particles and recently described new forms in parallel of complete viral particles (VP). This study was designed to depict circulating viral forms in HBV infected patient plasmas, using velocity gradients and most sensitive viral markers.\n\nPlasmas from chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients, HBeAg positive or negative, genotype D or E, were fractionated on velocity and equilibrium gradients with or without detergent treatment. Antigenic and molecular markers were measured in plasma and in each collected fraction.\n\nFast Nycodenz velocity gradients revealed good reproducibility and provided additional information to standard equilibrium sucrose gradients. HBV-RNAs circulated as enveloped particles in all plasmas, except one, and at lesser concentrations than VP. Calculations based on standardized measurements and relative virion and subviral particle molecular stoichiometry allowed to refine the experimental approach. For the HBeAg-positive plasma, VP were accompanied by an overproduction of enveloped capsids, either containing HBs, likely corresponding to empty virions, or for the main part, devoid of this viral envelope protein. Similarly, in the HBeAg-negative sample, HBs enveloped capsids, likely corresponding to empty virions, were detected and the presence of enveloped capsids devoid of HBs protein was suspected but not clearly evidenced due to the presence of contaminating high-density subviral particles. While HBeAg largely influences HBcrAg measurement and accounts for two-thirds of HBcrAg reactivity in HBeAg-positive patients, it remains a 10 times more sensitive marker than HBsAg to characterize VP containing fractions.\n\nUsing Nycodenz velocity gradients and standardized biomarkers, our study proposes a detailed characterization of circulating viral forms in chronically HBV infected patients. We provide evidence for an excess of capsids in DNA enriched fractions, likely due to the presence of empty virions but also by capsids enveloped by an HBs free lipid layer. Identification of this new circulating viral particle sets the basis for studies around the potential role of these entities in hepatitis B pathogeny and their physiological regulation.",

    "abstract": "A transition to ammonia recovery from wastewater has started; however, a technology for sustainable nitrogen retention in the form of ammonia is still in development. This study validated a microaerophilic activated sludge (MAS) system to efficiently retain ammonia from high-strength nitrogenous wastewater. The MAS is based on conventional activated sludge (CAS) with aerobic and settling compartments. Low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (<0.1 mg/L) and short solid retention times (SRTs) (<5 d) eliminated nitrifying bacteria. The two parallel MASs were successfully operated for 300 d and had ammonia retention of 101.7 {+/-} 24.9% and organic carbon removal of 85.5 {+/-} 8.9%. The MASs mitigated N2O emissions with an emission factor of <0.23%, much lower than the default value of CAS (1.6%). A short-term step-change test demonstrated that N2O indicated the initiation of nitrification and the completion of denitrification in the MAS. The parallel MASs had comparable microbial diversity, promoting organic carbon oxidation while inhibiting ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (AOMs), as revealed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, qPCR of functional genes, and fluorescent in situ hybridization of {beta}-Proteobacteria AOB. The microbial analyses also uncovered that filamentous bacteria were positively correlated with effluent turbidity. Together, controlling DO and SRT achieved successful ammonia retention, mainly by suppressing AOM activity. This process represents a new nitrogen management paradigm.\n\nSynopsisMoving from nitrogen removal to nitrogen recovery is critical for establishing a sustainable society. We provided proof-of-the-concept for a novel ammonia retention technology by retrofitting an activated sludge system.",

Then, we tested whether plant genotype influences the structure of seed fungal communities across different cultivars of T. aestivum (Aristato, Bologna, Rosia, and Vernia) and T. turgidum (Capeiti, Cappelli, Mazzancoio, Trinakria, and Timilia). We found that cultivar influences the seed fungal microbiome in both species. We found that in T. aestivum the seed fungal microbiota is more influenced by stochastic processes, while in T. turgidum selection plays a major role. Collectively, our results contribute in filling the knowledge gap on the wheat seed microbiome assembly and might help in understanding how we can manipulate this process to improve agriculture sustainability.",

    "abstract": "2Mobile genetic elements (MGEs), such as phages and plasmids, often possess accessory genes encoding bacterial functions, facilitating bacterial evolution. Are there evolutionary rules governing the arsenal of accessory genes MGEs carry? If such rules exist, they might be reflected in the types of accessory genes different MGEs carry. To test this hypothesis, we compare prophages and plasmids with respect to the frequencies at which they carry antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and virulence factor genes (VFGs) in the genomes of 21 pathogenic bacterial species using public databases. Our results indicate that prophages tend to carry VFGs more frequently than ARGs in three species, whereas plasmids tend to carry ARGs more frequently than VFGs in nine species. In Escherichia coli, where these trends are detected, prophage-borne VFGs encode a much narrower range of functions than do plasmid-borne VFGs, typically involved in damaging host cells or modulating host immunity. In the species where the above trends were not detected, ARGs and VFGs are barely found in prophages and plasmids. These results indicate that MGEs differentiate in the types of accessory genes they carry depending on their infection strategies, suggesting an evolutionary rule governing horizontal gene transfer mediated by MGEs.",

    "abstract": "Aquatic bacteria frequently are divided into lifestyle categories oligotroph or copiotroph. Oligotrophs have proportionately fewer transcriptional regulatory genes than copiotrophs and are generally non-motile/chemotactic. We hypothesized that the absence of chemotaxis/motility in oligotrophs prevents them from occupying nutrient patches long enough to benefit from transcriptional regulation. We first confirmed that marine oligotrophs are generally reduced in genes for transcriptional regulation and motility/chemotaxis. Next, using a non-motile oligotroph (Ca. Pelagibacter st. HTCC7211), a motile copiotroph (Alteromonas macleodii st. HOT1A3), and [14C]L-alanine, we confirmed that L-alanine catabolism is not transcriptionally regulated in HTCC7211 but is in HOT1A3. We then found that HOT1A3 took 2.5-4 min to initiate L-alanine oxidation at patch L-alanine concentrations, compared to <30s for HTCC7211. By modeling cell trajectories, we predicted that, in most scenarios, non-motile cells spend <2 min in patches, compared to >4 mins for chemotactic/motile cells. Thus, the time necessary for transcriptional regulation to initiate prevents transcriptional regulation from being beneficial for non-motile oligotrophs. This is supported by a mechanistic model we developed, which predicted that HTCC7211 cells with transcriptional regulation of L-alanine metabolism would produce 12% of their standing ATP stock upon encountering an L-alanine patch, compared to 880% in HTCC7211 cells without transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "The most virulent human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, has a complex life cycle between its human host and mosquito vector. Each stage is driven by a specific transcriptional program, but with a relatively high ratio of genes to specific transcription factors, it is unclear how genes are activated or silenced at specific times. The P. falciparum genome is relatively euchromatic compared to the mammalian genome, except for specific genes that are uniquely heterochromatinized via HP1. There seems to be an association between gene activity and spatial organization; however, the molecular mechanisms behind genome organization are unclear. While P. falciparum lacks key genome-organizing proteins found in metazoans, it does have all core components of the cohesin complex. In other eukaryotes, cohesin is involved in sister chromatid cohesion, transcription, and genome organization. To investigate the role of cohesin in P. falciparum, we combined genome editing, mass spectrometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing (ChIP-seq), and RNA sequencing to functionally characterize the cohesin subunit Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes protein 3 (SMC3). SMC3 knockdown in early stages of the intraerythrocytic developmental cycle (IDC) resulted in significant upregulation of a subset of genes involved in erythrocyte egress and invasion, which are normally expressed at later stages. ChIP-seq of SMC3 revealed that over the IDC, enrichment at the promoter regions of these genes inversely correlates with their expression and chromatin accessibility levels. These data suggest that SMC3 binding helps to repress specific genes until their appropriate time of expression, revealing a new mode of stage-specific, HP1-independent gene repression in P. falciparum.",

    "abstract": "Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) is a metabolic hub in virtually all living cells, serving as both a key precursor of essential biomass components and a metabolic sink for catabolic pathways of a large variety of substrates. Owing to this dual role, tight growth-production coupling schemes can be implemented around the AcCoA node. Inspired by this concept, a synthetic C2 auxotrophy was implemented in the platform bacterium Pseudomonas putida through an in silico-guided engineering approach. A growth-coupling strategy, driven by AcCoA demand, allowed for direct selection of an alternative sugar assimilation route--the phosphoketolase (PKT) shunt from bifidobacteria. Adaptive laboratory evolution forced the synthetic auxotroph to integrate the PKT shunt to restore C2 prototrophy. Large-scale structural chromosome rearrangements were identified as possible mechanisms for adjusting the network-wide proteome profile, resulting in improved PKT-dependent growth phenotypes. 13C-based metabolic flux analysis revealed an even split between the native Entner-Doudoroff and the synthetic PKT pathway for glucose processing, leading to enhanced carbon conservation. These results demonstrate that the P. putida metabolism can be radically rewired to incorporate a synthetic C2 metabolism, creating novel network connectivities and highlighting the importance of unconventional engineering strategies to support efficient microbial production.",

    "abstract": "The intrinsic, and the Rho-dependent mechanisms of transcription termination are conserved in bacteria. Generally, the two mechanisms have been illustrated as two independent pathways occurring in the 3 ends of different genes with contrasting requirements to halt RNA synthesis. However, a majority of the intrinsic terminators terminate transcription inefficiently leading to transcriptional read-through. The unwanted transcription in the downstream region beyond the terminator would have undesired consequences. To prevent such transcriptional read-through, bacteria must have evolved ways to terminate transcription more efficiently at or near the termination sites. We describe the participation of both the mechanisms, where intrinsic terminator and Rho factor contribute to prevent transcriptional read-through. Contribution from both the termination processes is demonstrated at the downstream regions of the genes both in vitro and in vivo in mycobacteria. Distinct patterns of cooperation between the two modes of termination were observed at the 3 untranslated regions of the genes to ensure efficient termination. We demonstrate similar mode of operation between the two termination processes in Escherichia coli suggesting a likely prevalence of this cooperation across bacteria. The reporter system developed to assess the Rho - intrinsic termination collaboration in vivo for mycobacteria and E. coli can readily be applied to other bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Hypoxia induces profound modifications in gene expression program enabling eukaryotic cells to adapt to lowered ATP supply resulting from the blockade of oxidative phosphorylation. One major consequence of oxygen deprivation is the massive repression of protein synthesis, leaving a limited set of mRNAs to be translated. D. melanogaster is strongly resistant to oxygen fluctuations, however the mechanisms allowing specific mRNA to be translated in hypoxia are still unknown. Here, we show that Ldh mRNA encoding lactate dehydrogenase is highly translated in hypoxia by a mechanism involving its 3 untranslated region. Furthermore, we identified the cap-binding protein eiF4HP as a main factor involved in 3UTR-dependent translation under hypoxia. In accordance with this observation, we show that eiF4EHP is necessary for Drosophila development under low oxygen concentrations and contributes to Drosophila mobility after hypoxic challenge. Altogether, our data bring new insight into mechanisms contributing to Drosophila adaptation to oxygen variations.",

    "abstract": "Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) grows in soils with widespread phosphate (Pi) deficiency, resulting in low shoot yield. While it also suffers from high Pi due to heavy fertilization, which causes the degradation of bamboo forest. A novel plant hormone, strigolactone (SL), plays a key role in root growth and development under Pi stress, but its regulatory mechanism has not been systematically reported. Our study investigated SL-mediated mechanism in response to Pi stress in moso bamboo. We compared the root growth under low, sufficient and high Pi, and analyzed the temporary trends of gene expression in primary root tip region and lateral root primordium zone. The effects of SL-analog (GR24) and SL-inhibitor (TIS108) on root architecture at low and high Pi were evaluated. SL biosynthesis and signaling are the main pathways of root response to Pi stress. With the decrease of Pi level, 5-deoxystrigol and strigol in the root exudates increase significantly. Under low Pi, SL is indispensable for the maintenance of root cell morphology, and promotes primary root elongation and reduces lateral root formation by upregulating the expression of phosphorous starvation response genes and downregulating the expression of abscisic acid response genes. The absence of SL at high Pi releases the inhibition of ethylene responsive genes expression to inhibit root elongation and promote branching. In general, SL mediates the response of bamboo roots to Pi stress by regulating its biosynthesis and signal transduction and influencing other hormone pathways.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), such as those produced by radiation and radiomimetics, are amongst the most toxic forms of cellular damage, in part because they involve extensive oxidative modifications at the break termini. Prior to completion of DSB repair, the chemically modified termini must be removed. Various DNA processing enzymes have been implicated in the processing of these  dirty ends, but molecular knowledge of this process is limited. Here, we demonstrate a role for the metallo-{beta}-lactamase fold 5'-3' exonuclease SNM1A in this vital process. Cells disrupted for SNM1A manifest increased sensitivity to radiation and radiomimetic agents and show defects in DSB damage repair. SNM1A is recruited and is retained at the sites of DSB damage via the concerted action of its three highly conserved PBZ, PIP box and UBZ interaction domains, which mediate interactions with poly-ADP-ribose chains, PCNA and the ubiquitinated form of PCNA, respectively. SNM1A can resect DNA containing oxidative lesions induced by radiation damage at break termini. The combined results reveal a crucial role for SNM1A to digest chemically modified DNA during the repair of DSBs and imply that the catalytic domain of SNM1A is an attractive target for potentiation of radiotherapy.",
