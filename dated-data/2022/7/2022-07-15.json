    "abstract": "The existence of purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn based on the most common supersweet mutation, shrunken2 (sh2), has not been previously reported, partly due to its extremely tight genetic linkage to a non-functional anthocyanin biosynthesis gene, anthocyaninless1 (a1). Generally, both aleurone- and pericarp-pigmented purple corn is starchy, the latter of which contains significantly higher anthocyanin compared to the former. The development of purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn is dependent on breaking the a1-sh2 tight genetic linkage, which occurs at a very low frequency of <1 in 1000 meiotic crossovers. Here, to develop purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn, an initial cross between a male purple-pericarp maize (purple-round seed),  Costa Rica (A1Sh2.A1Sh2) and a female white shrunken2 super-sweetcorn (white-shrunken seed),  Tims-white (a1sh2.a1sh2), was conducted. Subsequent self-pollination based on purple-pericarp-shrunken kernels identified a small frequency (0.08%) of initial heterozygous F3 segregants (A1a1.sh2sh2) producing a fully sh2 cob with a purple-pericarp phenotype, enabled by breaking the close genetic linkage between the a1 and sh2 genes. Resulting rounds of self-pollination generated a F6 homozygous purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn (A1A1.sh2sh2) line,  Tim1. Genome sequencing revealed a recombination break between the a1 and yz1 genes of the a1-yz1-x1-sh2 multigenic interval, with the sequence pattern of  Tim1 similar to the  Costa Rica parent, and after the linkage break, similar to the  Tims-white parent. The novel purple-pericarp super-sweetcorn produced a similar concentration of anthocyanin and sugar as in its purple-pericarp maize and white super-sweetcorn parents, respectively, potentially adding a broader range of health benefits than currently exists with standard yellow/white sweetcorn.",

    "abstract": "During growth and division, the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) is remodelled, resulting in the liberation of PG muropeptides which are typically reinternalized and recycled. Bacteria belonging to the Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales orders of the Alphaproteobacteria lack the canonical muropeptide transporter AmpG, despite having other key PG recycling enzymes. Here, we show that an alternative transporter, YejBEF-YepA, takes over this role in the Rhizobiales phytopathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Muropeptide import by YejBEF-YepA governs expression of the {beta}-lactamase AmpC in A. tumefaciens, contributing to {beta}-lactam resistance. However, we show that the absence of YejBEF-YepA causes severe cell wall defects that go far beyond lowered AmpC activity. Thus, contrary to previously established Gram-negative models, PG recycling is vital for cell wall integrity in A. tumefaciens. YepA is widespread in the Rhizobiales and Rhodobacterales, suggesting that YejBEF-YepA-mediated PG recycling could represent an important but overlooked aspect of cell wall biology in these bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs) are widely used as active agents in disinfectants, antiseptics, and preservatives. Despite being in use since the 1940s, there remain multiple open questions regarding their detailed mode-of-action and the mechanisms, including phenotypic heterogeneity, that can make bacteria less susceptible to QACs. To facilitate mode-of-action studies, we synthesized a fluorescent analogue of the quaternary ammonium compound benzalkonium chloride, namely N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-[2-[(4-nitro-2,1,3-benzoxadiazol-7-yl)amino]ethyl]azanium-iodide (NBD-DDA). NBD-DDA is readily detected by flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy with standard GFP/FITC-settings, making it suitable for molecular and single-cell studies. NBD-DDA was then used to investigate resistance mechanisms which can be heterogeneous among individual bacterial cells. Our results reveal that the antimicrobial activity of NBD-DDA against E. coli, S. aureus and P. aeruginosa is comparable to that of benzalkonium chloride (BAC), a widely used QAC. Characteristic time-kill kinetics and increased tolerance of a BAC tolerant E. coli strain against NBD-DDA suggest that the mode of action of NBD-DDA is similar to that of BAC. Leveraging these findings and NBD-DDAs fluorescent properties, we show that reduced cellular adsorption is responsible for the evolved BAC tolerance in the BAC tolerant E. coli strain. As revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), NBD-DDA is preferentially localized in the cell envelope of E. coli, which is a primary target of BAC and other QACs. Overall, NBD-DDAs antimicrobial activity, its fluorescent properties, and its ease of detection render it a powerful tool to study the mode-of-action and the resistance mechanisms of QACs in bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare hereditary disease caused by mutations in the CFTR gene. Recent therapies enable effective restoration of CFTR function of the most common F508del CFTR mutation. This shifts the unmet clinical need towards people with rare CFTR mutations such as nonsense mutations, of which G542X and W1282X are most prevalent. CFTR function measurements in patient-derived cell-based assays played a critical role in preclinical drug development for CF and may play an important role to identify new drugs for people with rare CFTR mutations.\n\nHere, we miniaturized the previously described forskolin induced swelling (FIS) assay in intestinal organoids from a 96-wells to a 384-wells plate screening format. Using this novel assay, we tested CFTR increasing potential of a 1400-compound FDA-approved drug library in organoids from donors with W1282X/W1282X CFTR nonsense mutations.\n\nThe 384-wells FIS-assay demonstrated uniformity and robustness based on CV and Z-factor calculations. In the primary screen, the top 5 compound combinations that increased CFTR function all contained at least one statin. In the secondary screen, we indeed verified that four out of the five statins, Mevastatin; Lovastatin; Simvastatin and Fluvastatin increased CFTR function when combined with CFTR modulators. Statin-induced CFTR rescue was W1282X specific, as increased CFTR function was not shown for patient-derived organoids harbouring R334W/R334W and F508del/F508del mutations.\n\nFuture studies should focus on elucidating genotype specificity and mode-of-action of statins into more detail. This study exemplifies proof-of-principle of large-scale compound screening in a functional assay using patient derived organoids.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500147v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fccbfdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b459ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7414fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10d9c35_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Intestinal epithelium dysfunction causes barrier defects, malabsorption and dysbiosis, predicting local and systemic disease, morbidity and mortality in humans. However, the underlying causes are not well understood. Here we show that telomere shortening is a host intrinsic factor that impairs enterocyte differentiation. The presence of such undifferentiated enterocytes is associated with barrier disruption and malabsorption of nutrients, such as fructose. A fructose-rich diet causes increased fructose spillover to the colon and induces colitis in a microbiome-dependent manner. The microbiome uses fructose to synthesize essential metabolites, including NAD precursors, that complement the hosts low NAD pool in the inflamed colon. Thus, telomere shortening drives enterocyte dysfunction and predisposes to diet-induced colitis through barrier disruption, increased nutrient flux to the colon and modulation of the microbiome. This differerentiation defect expands the canonical stem cell failure-centered view of how telomere shortening impacts the intestine and predisposes to intestinal disease in conditions associated with short telomeres.",

    "abstract": "The intracellular domains of connexins are essential for the assembly of gap junctions. For connexin 36 (Cx36), the major neuronal connexin, it has been shown that a dysfunctional PDZ binding motif interferes with electrical synapse formation. However, it is still unknown how this motif coordinates the transport of Cx36. In the present study, we characterize a phenotype of Cx36 mutants that lack a functional PDZ binding motif using HEK293T cells as an expression system. We provide evidence that an intact PDZ binding motif is critical for proper ER export of Cx36. Removing the PDZ binding motif of Cx36 results in ER retention and the formation of multi-membrane vesicles containing gap junction-like connexin aggregates. Using a combination of site directed mutagenesis and electron micrographs we reveal that these vesicles consist of Cx36 channels that docked prematurely in the ER. Our data suggest a model in which ER-retained Cx36 channels reshape the ER membrane into concentric whorls that are released into the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "{beta}-arrestins are master regulators of cellular signaling that operate by desensitizing ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) at the plasma membrane and promoting their subsequent endocytosis. The endocytic activity of {beta}-arrestins is ligand-dependent, triggered by GPCR binding, and increasingly recognized to have a multitude of downstream signaling and trafficking consequences that are specifically programmed by the bound GPCR. However, only one biochemical  mode for GPCR-mediated triggering of the endocytic activity is presently known- displacement of the {beta}-arrestin C-terminus (CT) to expose CCP-binding determinants that are masked in the inactive state. Here we revise this view by uncovering a second mode of GPCR-triggered endocytic activity that is independent of the {beta}-arrestin CT and, instead, requires the cytosolic base of the {beta}-arrestin C-lobe (CLB). We further show each of the discrete endocytic modes is triggered in a receptor-specific manner, with GPCRs that bind {beta}-arrestin transiently ( class A) primarily triggering the CLB-dependent mode and GPCRs that bind more stably ( class B) triggering both the CT and CLB-dependent modes in combination. Moreover, we show that each mode has opposing effects on the net signaling output of receptors- with the CLB-dependent mode promoting rapid signal desensitization and the CT-dependent mode enabling prolonged signaling. Together, these results fundamentally revise understanding of how {beta}-arrestins operate as efficient endocytic adaptors while facilitating diversity and flexibility in the control of cell signaling.",

    "abstract": "AimBrain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) supplementation after infarction increases heart function and decreases heart remodeling. BNP receptors, NPR-A and NPR-B, are expressed on adult cardiomyocytes (CMs). We thus investigated whether a part of the BNP cardioprotective effect in infarcted and unmanipulated hearts is due to modulation of the CM fate.\n\nMethods and ResultsBNP was injected in infarcted adult mice and in unmanipulated neonatal and adult mice. CMs were isolated, counted and characterized.\n\nIncreased number of CMs was detected in the hypoxic area of infarcted hearts, and in unmanipulated neonatal and adult hearts after BNP treatment. Accordingly, Troponin T plasma concentration was significantly reduced 1 and 3 days after infarction in BNP-treated mice, demonstrating less CM death. Furthermore, higher number of small, dedifferentiated and mononucleated CMs were identified in adult BNP-treated hearts when compared to saline-treated hearts. BNP-treated CMs express higher levels of mRNAs coding for hif1 alpha and for the different cyclins than CMs isolated from saline-treated hearts. Higher percentages of CMs undergoing DNA synthesis, expressing Ki67, phospho histone3 and Aurora B were detected in all BNP-treated hearts, which suggests that BNP stimulates CMs to re-enter to the cell cycle. Results in vitro confirmed that BNP stimulates the proliferation of the neonatal CMs and the dedifferentiation of the adult CMs.\n\nBNP effect on adult CMs in vivo is mediated by NPR-A binding and activation of the ERK MAP kinase pathway. Interestingly, increased number of CMs was also detected in adult infarcted hearts treated with LCZ696, which inhibits all natriuretic peptide degradations.\n\nConclusionsAltogether, our results identified BNP and all therapies aimed to increase BNPs bioavailability (such as LCZ696 treatment) as new targets to increase heart regeneration. By protecting CMs from cell death, and by stimulating their proliferation, BNP treatment leads to increased number of CMs in neonatal, adult unmanipulated and infarcted hearts.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate skin appendages are incredibly diverse. This diversity, which includes structures such as scales, feathers, and hair, likely evolved from a shared anatomical placode, suggesting broad conservation of the early development of these organs. Some of the earliest known skin appendages are dentine and enamel-rich tooth-like structures, collectively known as odontodes. These appendages evolved over 450 million years ago. Elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays) have retained these ancient skin appendages in the form of both dermal denticles (scales) and oral teeth. Despite our knowledge of denticle function in adult sharks, our understanding of their development and morphogenesis is less advanced. Even though denticles in sharks appear structurally similar to oral teeth, there has been limited data directly comparing the molecular development of these distinct elements. Here, we chart the development of denticles in the embryonic small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) and characterise the expression of conserved genes known to mediate dental development. We find that shark denticle emergence shares a vast gene expression signature with developing teeth. However, denticles have restricted regenerative potential, as they lack a sox2+ stem cell niche associated with the maintenance of a dental lamina, an essential requirement for continuous tooth replacement. We compare developing denticles to other skin appendages, including both sensory skin appendages and avian feathers. This reveals that denticles are not only tooth-like in structure, but that they also share an ancient developmental gene set that is likely common to all epidermal appendages.",

    "abstract": "Selfish genetic elements can promote their transmission at the expense of individual survival, creating conflict between the element and the rest of the genome. Recently, a large number of toxin-antidote (TA) post-segregation distorters have been identified in non-obligate outcrossing nematodes. Their origin and the evolutionary forces that keep them at intermediate population frequencies are poorly understood. Here, we study a TA element in C. elegans called peel-1/zeel-1. Two major haplotypes of this locus, with and without the selfish element, segregate in C. elegans. Here we study the fitness consequences of the peel-1/zeel-1 element outside of its role in gene drive in non-outcrossing animals. We demonstrate that loss of the toxin peel-1 decreased fitness of hermaphrodites and resulted in reductions in fecundity and body size. This fitness advantage is independent of the antidote zeel-1, suggesting that a distinct peel-1 pathway plays a biological role. This work demonstrates that a TA element can provide a fitness benefit to its hosts, either during their initial evolution or by being co-opted by the animals following their selfish spread. These findings guide our understanding on how TA elements can remain in a population where gene drive is minimized, helping resolve the mystery of prevalent TA elements in selfing animals.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression undergoes considerable changes during the aging process. The mechanisms regulating the transcriptional response to cellular aging remain poorly understood. Here, we employ the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to better understand how organisms adapt their transcriptome to promote longevity. Chronological lifespan (CLS) assays in yeast measure the survival of non-dividing cells at stationary phase over time, providing insights into the aging process of post-mitotic cells. Tra1 is an essential component of both the yeast SAGA/SLIK and NuA4 complexes, where it recruits these complexes to acetylate histones at targeted promoters. Importantly, Tra1 regulates the transcriptional response to multiple stresses. To evaluate the role of Tra1 in chronological aging, we took advantage of a previously characterized mutant allele that carries mutations in the TRA1 PI3K domain (tra1Q3). We found that loss of functions associated with tra1Q3 sensitized cells to growth media acidification and shortens lifespan. Transcriptional profiling reveals that genes differentially regulated by Tra1 during the aging process are enriched for components of the response to stress. Notably, expression of catalases (CTA1, CTT1) involved in hydrogen peroxide detoxification decreases in chronologically aged tra1Q3 cells. Consequently, they display increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. tra1Q3 cells are unable to grow on glycerol indicating a defect in mitochondria function. Aged tra1Q3 cells also display reduced expression of peroxisomal genes, exhibit decreased numbers of peroxisomes and cannot grow on media containing oleate. Thus, Tra1 emerges as an important regulator of longevity in yeast via multiple mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Post brain colonization, cancer cells may adhere to and spread along the abluminal surface of the vasculature providing advantageous access to oxygen, nutrients, and vessel-derived paracrine factors. For example, brain-tropic melanoma cells are well-known to invade along or within blood vessels at the invasive front, but the molecular mechanisms that guide this process are not well-characterized. We have used melanoma cells of different phenotypic states (melanocytic versus mesenchymal) to characterize different modes of perivascular invasion in the brain. We find that Sox9hi mesenchymal state melanoma cells undergo pericyte-like spreading along brain blood vessels via a Snail1-dependent process; in contrast, Sox10hi melanocytic state melanoma form proliferative, perivascular clusters. Snai1 deletion in mesenchymal-state melanoma cells diminishes Tgf{beta}-induced expression of Pdgfr{beta} which impairs Tgf{beta}/Pdgf ligand-driven motility along the brain microvasculature and dramatically reduces perivascular dispersal of melanoma cells throughout the brain post-colonization. These data suggest that, depending on their transcriptional/phenotypic state, some melanoma cells may appropriate signals that typically mediate endothelial cell:pericyte cross talk as an adaptive mechanism for maintaining vessel proximity and motility within the brain microenvironment.",
