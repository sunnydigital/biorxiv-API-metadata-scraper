    "abstract": "Chronic infections of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) create a very complex co-evolutionary process, where the virus tries to escape the continuously adapting host immune system. Quantitative details of this process are largely unknown and could help in disease treatment and vaccine development. Here we study a longitudinal dataset of ten HIV-infected people, where both the B-cell receptors and the virus are deeply sequenced. We focus on simple measures of turnover, which quantify how much the composition of the viral strains and the immune repertoire change between time points. At the single-patient level, the viral-host turnover rates do not show any statistically significant correlation, however they correlate if the information is aggregated across patients. In particular, we identify an anti-correlation: large changes in the viral pool composition come with small changes in the B-cell receptor repertoire. This result seems to contradict the naive expectation that when the virus mutates quickly, the immune repertoire needs to change to keep up. However, we show that the observed anti-correlation naturally emerges and can be understood in terms of simple population-genetics models.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing has led to a dramatic improvement in molecular diagnoses of serious pediatric disorders caused by apparently de novo mutations (DNMs); by contrast, clinicians ability to counsel the parents about the risk of recurrence in a future child has lagged behind. Owing to the possibility that one of the parents could be mosaic in their germline, a recurrence risk of 1-2% is frequently quoted, but for any specific couple, this figure is usually incorrect. We present a systematic approach to providing individualized recurrence risk stratification, by combining deep-sequencing of multiple tissues in the mother-father-child trio with haplotyping to determine the parental origin of the DNM. In the first 58 couples analysed (total of 59 DNMs in 49 different genes), the risk for 35 (59%) DNMs was decreased below 0.1% but for 6 (10%) couples it was increased owing to parental mosaicism - that could be quantified in semen (recurrence risks of 5.6-12.1%) for the paternal cases. Deep-sequencing of the DNM efficiently identifies couples at greatest risk for recurrence and may qualify them for additional reproductive technologies. Haplotyping can further reassure many other couples that their recurrence risk is very low, but its implementation is more technically challenging and will require better understanding of how couples respond to information that reduces their risks.",

Multibody kinematic optimisation methods are a critical aspect of movement analysis using musculoskeletal modelling software. By minimising soft tissue artefacts, they help in achieving higher fidelity joint kinematics and dynamics analyses. Prior studies have not examined the performance of multibody kinematic optimisation on subjects of varying body fat percentages. Herein, we: 1) have analysed the efficacy of three different multibody kinematic optimisation methods on varying body fat percentages, 2) implemented a novel weighting scheme to reduce error irrespective of body fat percentages. Residual error using gait data of 50 participants of varying body fat percentages was calculated through inverse kinematic analysis using OpenSim(c) musculoskeletal modelling software. The analysis was repeated using a time-based weighting scheme. The residual error of participants with higher body fat percentages was greater by 30% when compared to residual error of participants of lower body fat percentages. Additionally, time-based weighting scheme reduced residual error by 20% on average compared to constant-value weighting scheme. Our results indicate that multibody kinematic optimisation methods are adversely affected by higher body fat percentages and that time-based weighting can provide higher fidelity movement analysis irrespective of body fat percentages. Through our results we aim to develop tools which provide greater precision in obesity-related movement analysis. Such tools could also help address the disparities in rates of obesity associated with different ethnic or socioeconomic background.",

    "abstract": "Irreversible methylation of arginine residues generates asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). ADMA is a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Plasma ADMA concentrations increase with obesity and fall following weight loss. Here, we demonstrate that ADMA drives lipid accumulation through a newly identified NO-independent pathway via the amino-acid sensitive calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR). ADMA treatment of 3T3-L1 and HepG2 cells activates mTOR signalling and upregulates a suite of lipogenic genes with an associated increase in triglyceride content. Pharmacological blockade of CaSR inhibits ADMA driven lipid accumulation and ADMA treatment potentiates CaSR signalling via both Gq and Gi/o pathways. Impairment of ADMA metabolism in adipocytes in vivo, by dimethylamine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH1) deletion, increases visceral adiposity and adipocyte hypertrophy. This study identifies a signalling mechanism for ADMA as an endogenous ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor CaSR that potentially contributes to the impact of ADMA in cardiometabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "The mesolimbic dopamine system is implicated in signaling reward-related information as well as in actions that generate rewarding outcomes. These implications are commonly investigated in either Pavlovian or operant reinforcement paradigms, where only the latter requires instrumental action. To parse contributions of reward- and action-related information to dopamine signals, we directly compared the two paradigms: rats underwent either Pavlovian or operant conditioning while dopamine release was measured in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region central for processing this information. Task conditions were identical with the exception of the operant-lever response requirement. Rats in both groups released the same quantity of dopamine at the onset of the reward-predictive cue. However, only the operant-conditioning group showed a subsequent, sustained plateau in dopamine concentration throughout the entire five-second cue presentation (preceding the required action). This dopamine \"ramp\" was unaffected by probabilistic reward delivery, occurred exclusively prior to operant actions, and was not related to task performance or task acquisition, as it persisted throughout the two-week daily behavioral training. Instead, the ramp flexibly increased in duration with longer cue presentation, seemingly modulating the initial cue-onset triggered dopamine release (i.e., the reward-prediction error (RPE) signal), as both signal amplitude and sustain diminished when reward timing was made more predictable. Thus, our findings suggest that RPE and action components of dopamine release can be differentiated temporally into phasic and ramping/sustained signals, respectively, where the latter depends on the former and presumably reflects the anticipation or incentivization of appetitive action, conceptually akin to motivation.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is unclear whether the components of dopamine signals that are related to reward-associated information and reward-driven approach behavior can be separated. Most studies investigating the dopamine system utilize either Pavlovian or operant conditioning, which both involve the delivery of reward and necessitate appetitive approach behavior. Thus, used exclusively, neither paradigm can disentangle the contributions of these components to dopamine release. However, by combining both paradigms in the same study, we find that anticipation of a reward-driven operant action induces a modulation of reward-prediction-associated dopamine release, producing so-called \"dopamine ramps\". Therefore, our findings provide new insight into dopamine ramps, and suggest that dopamine signals integrate reward and appetitive action in a temporally distinguishable, yet dependent, manner.",

    "abstract": "Neural trajectories constitute propagating sequences of activity that are essential to cognitive representations. Understanding how neural trajectories overcome the disorganizing influence of neural noise in the awake state remains challenging. Theoretical and artificial network models have focused on optimizing the synaptic pathways underlying trajectory propagation. However, in a biophysical network with synaptic plasticity, solely altering synaptic connectivity induces a tight tradeoff between spurious trajectory interruptions and inductions by noise. Formal analysis predicts that separating the inhibitory fluctuations-driven spontaneous activity from the excitatory-driven trajectory propagation is key to reliable triggering and propagation. Amongst biophysical solutions, calcium-activated suprathreshold intrinsic conductances provided the best trajectory reliability by mitigating the reliance of propagation on connectivity. These mechanisms display parametric robustness and generalize to a variety of static and dynamic attractors with uni- and bidirectional propagation. Thus, we provide a unified framework for cognitive-associated neural trajectories robust to neural noise in the awake state.",

    "abstract": "Brain oscillations are produced by the coordinated activity of large groups of neurons and different rhythms are thought to reflect different modes of information processing. These modes, in turn, are known to occur at different spatial scales. Nevertheless, how these rhythms support different modes of information processing at the brain scale is not yet fully understood. Here we present \"Joint Time-Vertex Connectome Spectral Analysis\", a framework for characterizing the spectral content of brain activity both in time (temporal frequencies) and in space (spatial connectome harmonics). This method allows us to estimate the contribution of integration (global communication) and segregation (functional specialization) mechanisms at different temporal frequency bands in source-reconstructed M/EEG signals, thus providing a better understanding of the complex interplay between different information processing modes. We validated our method on two different datasets, an auditory steady-state response (ASSR) and a visual grating task. Our results suggest that different information processing mechanisms are carried out at different frequency channels: while integration seems to be a specific mechanism occurring at low temporal frequencies (alpha and theta), segregation is only observed at higher temporal frequencies (high and low gamma). Crucially, the estimated contribution of the integration and segregation mechanisms predicts performance in a behavioral task, demonstrating the neurophysiological relevance of this new framework.",

We conduct a computational and graph-theoretical study of the human structural connectome incorporating a variety of subcortical structures including the brainstem, which is typically not considered in similar studies. Our computational scheme involves the use of Python DIPY and Nibabel libraries to develop an averaged structural connectome comprised of 100 healthy adult subjects. We then compute degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centralities to identify several highly connected structures and find that the brainstem ranks highest across all examined metrics. Our results highlight the importance of including the brainstem in structural network analyses.

Integrating this meta-analytic information with public databases, biobehavioral and brain-functional association analyses suggested that INS involves sensory-integrative hubs with functional connections to mentalizing and attention networks. On the molecular and genetic levels, we found INS to be associated with GABAergic neurotransmission and layer IV/V neuronal circuits, protracted developmental gene expression patterns, and disorders of neurodevelopment. Although limited by the indirect nature of phenotypic-molecular association analyses, our findings generate new testable hypotheses on the neurobiological basis of INS.",

    "abstract": "Sub-millimeter functional imaging has the potential to capture cortical layer-specific functional information flow within and across brain systems. Recent sequence advancements of fMRI signal readout and contrast generations resulted in wide adaptation of layer-fMRI protocols across the global ultra-high-field (UHF) neuroimaging community. However, most layer-fMRI applications are confined to one of {approx}100 privileged UHF imaging centers, and sequence contrasts with unwanted sensitivity to large draining veins. In this work, we propose the application of vein-signal free vascular space occupancy (VASO) layerfMRI sequences at widely accessible 3T scanners. Specifically, we implement, characterize, and apply a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-sensitive VASO fMRI at a 3T scanner setup, as it is typically used in the majority of cognitive neuroscience and clinical neuroscience fMRI studies. We find that the longer [Formula], and stronger relative T1 contrast at 3T can account for some of the lower z-magnetization in the inversion-recovery VASO sequence compared to 7T and 9.4T. In the main series of experiments (N=16), we test the utility of this setup for motor tasks and find that-while being limited by thermal noise-3T layer-fMRI VASO is feasible within conventional scan durations. In a series of auxiliary studies, we furthermore explore the generalizability of the developed layer-fMRI protocols for a larger range of study designs including: visual stimulation, whole brain movie watching paradigms, and cognitive tasks with weaker effect sizes. We hope that the developed imaging protocols will help to increase accessibility of vein-signal free layer-fMRI imaging tools to a wider community of neuroimaging centers.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/501554v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b2c6b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@139b13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@129ff82org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@45e9d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Although much has been written on the topic of social behavior, many terms referring to different aspects of social behavior have become inappropriately conflated and the specific mechanisms governing them remains unclear. It is therefore critical that we disentangle the pro- and anti-social elements associated with different forms of social behavior to fully understand the social brain. The lateral septum (LS) mediates social behaviors, emotional processes, and stress responses necessary for individuals to navigate day-to-day social interactions. The LS is particularly important in general and selective prosocial behavior (monogamy) but its role in how these two behavioral domains intersect is unclear. Here, we investigate the effects of chemogenetic-mediated LS activation on social responses in male prairie voles when they are 1) sex-naive and generally affiliative and 2) after they become pair-bonded and display selective aggression. Amplifying neural activity in the LS augments same-sex social approach behaviors. Despite partner preference formation remaining unaltered, LS activation in pair-bonded males leads to reduced selective aggression while increasing social affiliative behaviors. These results suggest that LS activation alters behavior within certain social contexts, by increasing sex-naive affiliative behaviors and reducing pair bonding-induced selective aggression with same-sex conspecifics, but not altering bonding with opposite-sex individuals.",

The method is able to predict affinities obtained with techniques as different as uPBM, gcPBM and HT-SELEX with an excellent performance, much better than existing algorithms. Due to its nature, the method can be extended to epigenetic variants, mismatches, mutations, or any non-coding nucleobases. When complemented with chromatin structure information, our in vitro trained method provides also good estimates of in vivo binding sites in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Lake deoxygenation is of growing concern because it threatens ecosystem services delivery. Complete deoxygenation, anoxia, is projected to prolong and expand in lakes, promoting the production or release of nutrients, greenhouse gases and metals from water column and the sediments. Accumulation of these compounds cannot be easily predicted thus hindering our capacity to forecast the ecological consequences of global changes on aquatic ecosystems. Here, we used lakes Arendsee and Mendota monitoring data to develop a novel metric, anoxic age, characterizing lake hypolimnetic anoxia. Anoxic age explained, as a single predictor, 44% to 58% of the variation for ammonium, soluble reactive phosphorus and a dissolved organic matter fluorophore. Anoxic age could be modelled using only two oxygen profiles and lake bathymetry, making it an easily applicable tool to interpret and extrapolate biogeochemical data. This novel metric thus has the potential to transform widely available oxygen profiles into an ecologically meaningful variable.\n\nScientific Significance StatementOxygen depletion in deep water layers of lakes is of growing concern as it expands due to eutrophication and climate change. Anoxia is deleterious to benthic invertebrates and fishes, enables the production of potent greenhouse gases and releases stored phosphorus from sediments, among others. However, quantitatively forecasting the consequences of anoxia remains a challenge. Here, we developed a novel metric, anoxic age, which may be derived from oxygen profiles to predict end-of-summer concentration of various water chemical parameters. We argue that all by-products of anaerobic microbial metabolism should be related to anoxic age as they are released or processed continuously during anoxia. We believe that anoxic age can be used to predict the ecological consequences of temporally and spatially growing anoxia.",

    "abstract": "An individuals lifetime reproductive success (LRS) measures its realised genetic contributions to the next generation, but how well does it predict these over longer periods? Here we use human genealogical data to estimate expected individual genetic contributions (IGC) and quantify the degree to which LRS, relative to other fitness proxies, predicts IGC over longer periods in natural populations. This allows an identification of the life-history stages that are most important in shaping variation in IGC. We use historical genealogical data from two non-isolated local populations in Switzerland to estimate the stabilised IGC for 2,230 individuals ~10 generations after they were born. We find that LRS explains 30% less variation in IGC than the best predictor of IGC, the number of grandoffspring. However, albeit less precise than the number of grandoffspring, we show that LRS does provide an unbiased prediction of IGC and overall predicts IGC better than lifespan and similarly when accounting for offspring survival to adulthood. Overall, our findings demonstrate the value of human genealogy data to evolutionary biology and showing that reproduction - more than lifespan or offspring survival - impacts the long-term genetic contributions of historic humans, even in a population with appreciable migration.",

    "abstract": "This study sought to examine the association between DNA methylation and body mass index (BMI) and the potential utility of these cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites in predicting metabolic health. We pooled summary statistics from six trans-ethnic EWAS of BMI representing nine cohorts (n=17058), replicated these findings in the Womens Health Initiative (WHI, n=4822) and developed an epigenetic prediction score of BMI. In the pooled EWAS, 1265 CpG sites were associated with BMI (p<1E-7), and 1238 replicated in the WHI (FDR < 0.05). We performed several stratified analyses to examine whether these associations differed between individuals of European descent and individuals of African descent. We found five CpG sites had a significant interaction with BMI by race/ethnicity. To examine the utility of the significant CpG sites in predicting BMI, we used elastic net regression to predict log normalized BMI in the WHI (80% training/20% testing). This model found 397 sites could explain 32% of the variance in BMI in the WHI test set. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI overestimated their BMI (high epigenetic BMI) had significantly higher glucose and triglycerides, and lower HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol compared to accurately predicted BMI. Individuals whose methylome-predicted BMI underestimated their BMI (low epigenetic BMI) had significantly higher HDL-cholesterol and lower glucose and triglycerides. This study identified 553 previously identified and 685 novel CpG sites associated with BMI. Participants with high epigenetic BMI had poorer metabolic health suggesting that the overestimation may be driven in part by cardiometabolic derangements characteristic of metabolic syndrome.",

Using real data from thousands of human gut and vaginal microbiota, we demonstrate phylogenetic placement, but not closed OTUs, were able to group communities by origin (stool vs vaginal) without being confounded by technique and integrate new data into existing ordination/clustering models for precision medicine.

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, with the majority of cases initiated by inactivation of the APC tumor suppressor. This results in the constitutive transcriptional activation of the canonical WNT signal transduction pathway effector {beta}-Catenin, along with induction of WNT feedback inhibitors, including the extracellular palmitoleoyl-protein carboxylesterase NOTUM. Here, we show that NOTUM retains cell-autonomous tumor suppressive activity in APC-null adenomatous lesions despite constitutive {beta}-Catenin activation. Strikingly, we find that NOTUM becomes an obligate oncogene upon subsequent P53 inactivation during the adenoma-adenocarcinoma transition, and that these phenotypes are WNT-independent, resulting from differential activity of NOTUM upon its enzymatic targets Glypican 1 and 4 in early vs. late-stage disease, respectively. Ultimately, preclinical mouse models of CRC and human tumoroid cultures demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of NOTUM is highly effective in arresting primary adenocarcinoma growth and inhibiting metastatic colonization of distal organs. The finding that a single agent targeting an extracellular enzyme is effective in treating highly aggressive tumors make NOTUM a novel therapeutic vulnerability in advanced colorectal adenocarcinomas.",

    "abstract": "Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria (PGPR) dwell in the rhizosphere, the area surrounding the root of plants, and enhance growth of the host through different mechanisms: they can protect plants against pathogens, assist in nutrient gathering, and in increasing stress tolerance. Hence, developing strategies to enhance their performance is important to increase crop productivity. Specific solutions are necessary to enhance the performance of the beneficials while simultaneously avoiding nurturing of pathogens. This requires insights into the mechanisms underlying these microbials interactions. Pseudomonas is one of the most studied genera and contains both beneficials and pathogenic species. Hence, we used comparative genome-scale constraint-based metabolic modeling to reveal key features of both classes of Pseudomonads and which can provide leads for the possible interventions regarding these solutions. Models of 75 plant-growth promoting rhizosphere and 33 epiphytic pathogenic Pseudomonas strains were automatically reconstructed and validated using phenotype microarray (Biolog) data. The models were used for compositional analysis and 12 representative strains, 6 of each group, were further selected for extensive simulation. The analyses reveal differences in the potential for metabolite uptake and transport between these two distinct classes that suggest their nutrient preferences and their differences in, among other, D-ornithine acquisition mechanisms. The models enable simulation of metabolic state of root exudates. Simulations highlighted and summarized the differences in pathway utilization and intracellular states between two groups. The insights obtained will be very valuable to broader such studies of rhizobiome and to possibly develop strategies to improve crop productivity by supporting the beneficial microbiome while reducing pathogen activities.",

Differentially expressed genes and differentially accessible motifs were used to examine transcriptional pathways and transcription factor (TF) activities across the cell population.

Repurposing of known drugs can be a fast route to obtain molecules that inhibit viral infection and/or modulate pathogenic host responses. Honokiol is a small molecule from Magnolia trees, for which several biological effects have been reported,, including anticancer and anti-inflammatory activity. Honokiol has also been shown to inhibit several viruses in cell culture. In this study, we show that honokiol protected Vero E6 cells from SARS-CoV-2-mediated cytopathic effect with an EC50 of 7.8 {micro}M. In viral load reduction assays we observed that honokiol decreased viral RNA copies as well as viral infectious progeny titers. The compound also inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in the more relevant A549 cells, expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2. A time-of-addition assay showed that honokiol inhibited virus replication even when added post infection, suggesting it acts at a post-entry step of the replication cycle. Honokiol was also effective against more recent variants of SARS-CoV-2, including omicron and it inhibited other human coronaviruses as well. Our study suggests that honokiol is an interesting molecule to evaluate in animal studies and clinical trials to investigate its effect on virus replication and pathogenic (inflammatory) host responses.",

    "abstract": "Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) and its most abundant component, 2-Fucosyllactose (2-FL), are known to be immunomodulatory. Previously, it was shown that HMOs and 2-FL bind to the C-type lectin receptor DC-SIGN. Here we show, using a ligand-receptor competition assay, that a whole mixture of HMOs from pooled human milk (HMOS) and 2-FL inhibit the binding of the carbohydrate-binding receptor DC-SIGN to its prototypical ligands, fucose and the oligosaccharide Lewis-B, (Leb) in a dose-dependent way. Interestingly, such inhibition by HMOS and 2-FL was not detected for another C-type lectin, Langerin, evolutionary similar to DC-SIGN. The cell-ligand competition assay using DC-SIGN expressing cells confirmed that 2-FL inhibits the binding of DC-SIGN to Leb. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations show that 2-FL exists in a preorganized bioactive conformation before binding to DC-SIGN and this conformation is retained after binding to DC-SIGN. Leb has more flexible conformations and utilizes two binding modes, which operate one at a time via its two fucoses to bind to DC-SIGN. 2-FL may have a reduced entropic penalty due to its preorganized state compared to Leb, and it has lower binding enthalpy, suggesting better binding to DC-SIGN. Thus, due to the better binding to DC-SIGN, 2-FL may replace Leb from its binding pocket in DC-SIGN. MD simulations also showed that 2-FL does not bind to Langerin. Our studies confirm 2-FL as a specific ligand for DC-SIGN and suggest that 2-FL can replace other DC-SIGN ligands from its binding pocket during ligand-receptor interactions in possible immunomodulatory processes.",

    "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is well known as a component in the exhaled breath of humans. It has been assumed for a long time that formation of CH4 in humans occurs exclusively by anaerobic microbial activity (methanogenesis) in the gastrointestinal tract. A fraction of the produced CH4 is excreted via the lungs and can then be detected in the breath. However, recent studies challenge this view by showing that CH4 might also be produced endogenously in cells by oxidative-reductive stress reactions. Thus, an increased and fluctuating level of breath CH4 compared to the base level of an individual might also indicate enhanced oxidative stress levels. Thus, monitoring breath CH4 levels might have great potential for  in vivo diagnostics.\n\nGenerally, vaccines generate a strong immune response including the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. To evaluate the effect from current vaccines against COVID-19 on breath CH4 dynamics, breath CH4 was monitored from 12 subjects prior and after the injection of several COVID-vaccines. Prior to COVID-19 vaccination the concentration of breath CH4 was frequently measured by gas chromatograph flame ionization detection (GC-FID, with analytical precision better than 10 parts per billion, ppbv) to obtain the individual variation range of breath CH4 for each subject. Following vaccination, CH4 breath samples were collected at high frequency for a period of 14 days.\n\nAll subjects monitored showed a strong response in breath CH4 release within 1 to 72 hours after vaccination including shifts and high fluctuations with maximum peaks showing a factor of up to {+/-}100 compared to base values. Thus, it is highly likely that the observed changes in breath CH4 are coupled to immune responses following Covid-19 vaccination. These preliminary results strongly support the hypothesis that non-microbial methane liberation and utilisation in the human body might be also linked to cellular processes and stress responses independent of classical microbial methanogenesis. Thus, CH4 might be used as a breath biomarker for specific immune responses and individual immune states.",

    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum replicates via schizogony: a fundamentally unusual type of cell cycle involving asynchronous replication of multiple nuclei within the same cytoplasm. It also has one of the most A/T-biased genomes ever sequenced. Here, we present the first comprehensive study of the specification and activation of DNA replication origins during Plasmodium schizogony. Potential replication origins were found to be abundant, with ORC1-binding sites detected every [~]800 bp throughout the genome. They had no motif enrichment, but were biased towards areas of higher G/C content. Origin activation was then measured at single-molecule resolution via new DNAscent technology that measures fork movement by detecting base analogues BrdU and EdU in DNA sequenced on the Oxford nanopore platform (https://github.com/MBoemo/DNAscent). DNAscent-called origins were found to be much less dense than ORC1-binding sites, with origins activated preferentially in areas of low transcriptional activity. Consistently, replication forks moved fastest through the most lowly transcribed genes, suggesting that conflicts between transcription and origin firing inhibit efficient replication, and that P. falciparum has evolved its S-phase to minimise such conflicts.",

    "abstract": "Fluctuating conditions and diverse stresses are typical in natural environments. In response, cells mount complex responses across multiple scales, including adjusting their shape to withstand stress. In enterobacteria, the Rcs phosphorelay is activated by cell envelope damage and by changes to periplasmic dimensions and cell width. Here, we investigated the physiological and morphological consequences of Rcs activation in Escherichia coli in the absence of stresses, using an inducible version of RcsF that mislocalizes to the inner membrane, RcsFIM. Expression of RcsFIM immediately reduced cellular growth rate and the added length per cell cycle in a manner that was directly dependent on induction levels, but independent of Rcs-induced capsule production. At the same time, cells increased intracellular concentration of the cell division protein FtsZ, and decreased the distance between division rings in filamentous cells. Depletion of the Rcs negative regulator IgaA phenocopied RcsFIM induction, indicating that IgaA is essential due to growth inhibition in its absence. However, A22 treatment did not affect growth rate or FtsZ intracellular concentration, despite activating the Rcs system. These findings suggest that the effect of Rcs activation on FtsZ levels is mediated indirectly through growth-rate changes, and highlight feedbacks among the Rcs stress response, growth dynamics, and cell-size control.",

    "abstract": "Industrialization - including urbanization, participation in the global food chain, and consumption of heavily processed foods - is thought to drive substantial shifts in the human microbiome. While diet strongly influences stool microbiome composition, the influence of diet on the oral microbiome, and particularly dental plaque, is largely speculative. Here we investigated whether dental plaque microbial communities are distinctly different across populations with dissimilar subsistence strategies and degree of industrialized market integration. Using a metagenomic approach, we compared the dental plaque microbiomes of Baka foragers and Nzime subsistence agriculturalists in Cameroon (n = 46) with the dental plaque and calculus microbiomes of highly industrialized populations in North America and Europe. We found that differences in microbial taxonomic composition between populations were minimal, with high conservation of abundant microbial taxa and no significant differences in microbial diversity related to dietary practices. Instead, we find that the major source of variation in dental plaque microbial species composition is related to tooth location and oxygen availability, and may be influenced by toothbrushing or other dental hygiene measures. Our results support that dental plaque, in contrast to the stool microbiome, maintains an inherent stability against ecological perturbations in the oral environment.",

    "abstract": "Cells in microbial communities on surfaces live and divide in close proximity, which greatly enhances the potential for social interactions. Spatiogenetic structures manifest through competitive and cooperative interactions among the same and different genotypes within a shared space, and extracellular secretions appear to function dynamically at the forefront. A previous experimental evolution study utilizing Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1 colonies demonstrated that diverse mutations in the rsmE gene are repeatedly and exclusively selected through the formation of a dominant spatial structure. RsmEs primary molecular function is translation repression, and its homologs regulate various social and virulence phenotypes. Pseudomonas spp. possess multiple paralogs of Rsm proteins, and RsmA, RsmE, and RsmI are the most prevalent. Here, we demonstrate that the production of a mucoid polymer and a biosurfactant are exclusively regulated through RsmE, contradicting the generalized notion of functional redundancy among the Rsm paralogs. Furthermore, we identify the biosurfactant as the cyclic lipopeptide gacamide A. Competition and microscopy analyses show that the mucoid polymer is solely responsible for creating a space of low cellular density, which is shared exclusively by the same genotype. Gacamide A and other RsmE-regulated products appear to establish a physical boundary that prevents the encroachment of the competing genotype into the newly created space. Although cyclic lipopeptides and other biosurfactants are best known for their antimicrobial properties and reducing surface tension to promote the spreading of cells on various surfaces, they also appear to help define spatial structure formation within a dense community.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn densely populated colonies of the bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf0-1, diverse mutations in the rsmE gene are naturally selected by solving the problem of overcrowding. Here, we show that RsmE-regulated secretions function together to create and protect space of low cell density. A biosurfactant generally promotes the spreading of bacterial cells on abiotic surfaces, however, it appears to function atypically within a crowded population by physically defining genotypic boundaries. Another significant finding is that these secretions are not regulated by RsmEs paralogs that share high sequence similarity. The experimental pipeline described in this study is highly tractable and should facilitate future studies to explore additional RsmE-regulated products and address why RsmE is functionally unique from its paralogs.",

    "abstract": "Efficient spread of respiratory viruses requires the virus to maintain infectivity in the environment. Environmental stability of viruses can be influenced by many factors, including temperature and humidity. Our study measured the impact of initial droplet volume (50, 5, and 1 {micro}L) and relative humidity (RH: 40%, 65%, and 85%) on the stability of influenza A virus, bacteriophage, Phi6, a common surrogate for enveloped viruses, and SARS-CoV-2 under a limited set of conditions. Our data suggest that the drying time required for the droplets to reach quasi-equilibrium (i.e. a plateau in mass) varied with RH and initial droplet volume. The macroscale physical characteristics of the droplets at quasi-equilibrium varied with RH but not with initial droplet volume. We observed more rapid virus decay when the droplets were still wet and undergoing evaporation, and slower decay after the droplets had dried. Initial droplet volume had a major effect on virus viability over the first few hours; whereby the decay rate of influenza virus was faster in smaller droplets. In general, influenza virus and SARS-CoV-2 decayed similarly. Overall, this study suggests that virus decay in media is closely correlated with the extent of droplet evaporation, which is controlled by RH. Taken together, these data suggest that decay of different viruses is more similar at higher RH and in smaller droplets and is distinct at lower RH and in larger droplets. Importantly, accurate assessment of transmission risk requires use of physiologically relevant droplet volumes and careful consideration of the use of surrogates.\n\nFundingNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health; Department of Health and Human Services; Flu Lab.\n\nImportanceDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, policy decisions were being driven by virus stability experiments involving SARS-CoV-2 applied to surfaces in large droplets at various humidity conditions. The results of our study indicate that determination of half-lives for emerging pathogens in large droplets likely over-estimates transmission risk for contaminated surfaces, as occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our study implicates the need for the use of physiologically relevant droplet sizes with use of relevant surrogates in addition to what is already known about the importance of physiologically relevant media for risk assessment of future emerging pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The Rcs signal transduction system is a phosphorelay responsible for sensing a wide variety of enterobacterial cell envelope stresses. In Escherichia coli, the Rcs system is required to survive A22 and mecillinam treatment, two drugs that perturb cell size. To test whether cell size changes might be correlated with envelope damage and thereby sensed by the Rcs system, we tuned E. coli cell size via drug inhibition with A22, point mutations to the cell-shape determinant MreB, and mechanically confined growth. In all conditions, cell width was strongly correlated with Rcs activation, with wider cells exhibiting more activation than wild-type. In all conditions, RcsF, the outer membrane-localized upstream component of the Rcs system, was essential for responding to cell width changes. Consistently, several envelope gene deletions known to induce the Rcs system via RcsF resulted in cells that were wider than wild-type. Cryo- electron microscopy revealed that the periplasm of a wide MreB mutant was on average [~]3 nm thinner than wild-type, thereby bringing RcsF closer to the downstream components of the signaling cascade in the inner membrane. Conversely, extending the flexible linker region of RcsF by [~]3 nm increased Rcs activity in wild-type cells. In summary, we propose that the Rcs system responds to changes in cell width because of altered periplasmic thickness.",

Mass spectrometry analysis of its protein content opens a vista into the subjects diet, oral flora, and even some aspects of health, thus providing new insight and expanding our knowledge of archaic cultures. Multiple experimental protocols have been proposed for the optimal extraction of proteins from dental calculus. Herein, we compared various experimental conditions in order to calibrate and validate a protocol for protein extraction. Our results show that a high concentration of acetic acid followed by mechanical crushing and sonication provided the highest protein yield, while acetone precipitation enabled the identification of more distinct proteins. We validated this protocol using archeological samples, identifying human and microbial proteins in specimens from the 8th and 17th centuries (approximately 250-1300 years ago). These findings demonstrate that the developed protocol is useful for studying excavated archaeological samples and that it might be utilized to explore the biohistory, dietary habits, and microbiome of archaic populations.",

Here we investigate the structure of actively transcribed chromatin and the architecture of its interaction with active RNA polymerase.\n\nFor this analysis, we have used super-resolution microscopy to image the Drosophila melanogaster Y loops which represent huge, several megabases long, single transcription units. The Y loops provide a particularly amenable model system for transcriptionally active chromatin. We find that, although these transcribed loops are decondensed they are not organised as extended 10nm fibres, but rather they largely consist of chains of nucleosome clusters. The average width of each cluster is around 50nm. We find that foci of active RNA polymerase are generally located off the main fibre axis on the periphery of the nucleosome clusters. Foci of RNA polymerase and nascent transcripts are distributed around the Y loops rather than being clustered in individual transcription factories. However, as the RNA polymerase foci are considerably less prevalent than the nucleosome clusters, the organisation of this active chromatin into chains of nucleosome clusters is unlikely to be determined by the activity of the polymerases transcribing the Y loops.\n\nThese results provide a foundation for understanding the topological relationship between chromatin and the process of gene transcription.",

Sertoli cells are metabolically highly active and physiologically regulated by external signals, particularly factors in the blood stream. In disease conditions, circulating pathological signals may affect Sertoli cells and consequentially, alter germ cells and fertility. While the effects of stress on reproductive cells have been well studied, how Sertoli cells respond to stress remains poorly characterized. Therefore, we used a mouse model of early postnatal stress to assess the effects of stress on Sertoli cells. We developed an improved enrichment strategy based on intracellular stainings and obtained enriched preparations of adult Sertoli cells from exposed males. We show that adult Sertoli cells have impaired electron transport chain (ETC) pathways and that several components of ETC complexes I, III, and IV are persistently affected. We identify the circulation as a potential mediator of the effects of stress, since treatment of primary Sertoli cells with serum from stressed males induces similar ETC alterations. These results newly highlight Sertoli cells as cellular targets of early life stress, and suggest that they may contribute to the negative effects of stress on fertility.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe present an improved method to obtain enriched preparations of Sertoli cells from adult mouse testis for molecular analyses\nC_LIO_LISertoli cells from adult males exposed to stress during early postnatal life have altered electron transport chain (ETC) expression, suggesting persistent effects of early life stress on Sertoli cells physiology\nC_LIO_LISerum from adult males exposed to early postnatal stress reproduces ETC gene dysregulation in cultured Sertoli cells.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=147 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/501498v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (54K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ba92e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1032032org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@36bf72org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@52e3d6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Atomistic simulations and cell-based experiments with genetically modified connecting peptides demonstrate that rigidified hinge residues result in excessive CD3 dynamics and hypersensitivity to pMHC binding.

    "abstract": "Uridine insertion/deletion RNA editing is an extensive post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial mRNAs in kinetoplastid organisms, including Trypanosoma brucei. This process is carried out using trans-acting gRNAs and complex protein machinery. The essential RNA Editing Substrate Binding Complex (RESC) serves as the scaffold that modulates protein and RNA interactions during editing, and contains the Guide RNA Binding Complex (GRBC), the RNA Editing Mediator Complexes (REMCs), and organizer proteins. Despite the importance of RESC in editing, the functions of each protein comprising this complex are not completely understood. Here, we further define the roles of a REMC protein, RESC13, and a RESC organizer, RESC14, using high-throughput sequencing on two large pan-edited mRNAs, A6 and COIII. When comparing our analyses to that of a previously published small pan-edited mRNA, RPS12, we find that RESC13 has conserved functions across the three transcripts with regards to editing initiation, gRNA utilization, gRNA exchange, and restricting the formation of long mis-edited junctions that likely arise from its ability to modulate RNA structure. However, RESC13 does have transcript-specific effects on the types of long junctions whose formation it restricts. RESC14 has a conserved effect on gRNA utilization across the three transcripts analyzed, but has transcript-specific effects on editing initiation, gRNA exchange, and junction formation. Our data suggest that transcript-specific effects of both proteins are due to differences in transcript length and sequences as well as transcript-specific protein interactions. These findings highlight the importance of studying multiple transcripts to determine the function of editing factors.",

    "abstract": "The agricultural importance of sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is rapidly increasing. Several bacterial and fungal pathogens infecting sea buckthorn have been identified and characterized; however, the viral pathogens are not yet known. In this study, we identified, isolated, and sequenced a virus from a wild plantation of sea buckthorn for the first time. Sequence analysis of the obtained viral genome revealed high similarity with sequences of several viruses belonging to the genus Marafivirus, especially olive latent virus 3 (OLV-3). The genome of the new virus is 6,989 nucleotides (nt) in length according to 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (without polyA-tail), with 5' and 3' untranslated regions being 133 and 109 nt long, respectively. The viral genome encoded two open reading frames (ORFs). ORF1 encoded a polyprotein of 1,954 amino acids (aa) with the characteristic marafivirus non-structural protein domains--methyltransferase, Salyut domain, papain-like cysteine protease, helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. ORF1 was separated from ORF2 by a six nt and encoded the coat protein (CP). CP had typical signatures of minor (30.96 kDa) and major (21.18 kDa) forms. Both CP forms were cloned and expressed in a bacterial expression system, and only the major CP was able to self-assemble into 30 nm virus-like particles that resembled the native virus, thus demonstrating that minor CP is not essential for virion assembly. We suggest the newly discovered virus to be named as \"Sea buckthorn marafivirus\", abbreviated as \"SBuMV\".\n\nAuthor summarySea buckthorn is an exceptionally valuable plant that is currently widely cultivated as multipurpose horticultural species for food, pharmacology, cosmetics, and landscape conservation. Diseases and pests directly affect the cultivation of SBT. To date, several pests and diseases, mainly fungal and bacterial, but no viral, sea buckthorn have been reported. Identification of new pathogens would assist in the development of control strategies, and quarantine purposes and ensure sustainable sea buckthorn cultivation. Here, for the first time, we present a virus putatively infecting sea buckthorn. We had characterized its full genome, cloned and expressed minor and major forms of coat protein either individually or co-expressed. We also showed that major coat protein-derived virus-like particles self- assembled directly in the bacterial cells, and the majority of the expressed CPs were soluble. Our study suggests that the minor CP is not essential for the assembly of seemingly structurally intact viral particles, meaning that it can have other functions.",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide transcriptional activity involves the binding of many transcription factors to thousands of sites in the genome. Determining which sites are directly driving transcription remains a challenge. Here we use acute protein depletion of the pioneer transcription factors OCT4 and SOX2 to establish their functionality in maintaining chromatin accessibility. We show that thousands of accessible sites are lost within an hour of protein depletion, indicating rapid turnover of these sites in the absence of pioneer factors. To understand the relationship with transcription we performed nascent transcription analysis and found that open chromatin sites that are maintained by SOX2 are highly predictive of gene expression, in contrast to SOX2 binding sites that do not maintain accessibility. We use CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in the Klf2 locus to functionally validate a predicted regulatory element. We conclude that the regulatory activity of SOX2 is exerted largely at sites where it maintains accessibility and that other binding sites are largely dispensable for gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Circadian rhythms influence many behaviors and diseases1, 2. They arise from oscillations in gene expression caused by repressor proteins that directly inhibit transcription of their own genes. The fly circadian clock offers a valuable model for studying these processes, wherein Timeless (TIM) plays a critical role in mediating nuclear entry of the transcriptional repressor Period (PER) and the photoreceptor Cryptochrome (CRY) entrains the clock by triggering TIM degradation in light2, 3. The cryo-EM structure of the CRY:TIM complex reveals how a light-sensing cryptochrome recognizes its target. CRY engages a continuous core of N-terminal TIM armadillo (ARM) repeats, resembling how photolyases recognize damaged DNA, and binds a C-terminal TIM helix reminiscent of the interactions between light-insensitive CRYs and their partners in mammals. The structure highlights how the CRY flavin cofactor undergoes conformational changes that couple to large-scale rearrangements at the molecular interface, and how a phosphorylated segment in TIM may impact clock period by regulating the binding of importin- and the nuclear import of TIM:PER4, 5. Moreover, the structure reveals that the TIM N-terminus inserts into the restructured CRY pocket to replace the autoinhibitory C-terminal tail released by light, thereby providing a possible explanation for how the LS-TIM polymorphism adapts flies to different climates6, 7.",

    "abstract": "Protein synthesis is tightly regulated under stress conditions where energy may be scarce. Despite global repression of translation, some transcripts remain actively translated in order for the cell to be able to respond to the insult or prepare to quickly return normal cellular function after the stress ends. For the insulin receptor (Insr) and insulin-like growth factor receptor (Igf1r) transcripts this translation is mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in their 5UTRs that functions independently of eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A) and eIF4E. Here we show that these cellular IRESes are also able to promote translation independently of the scaffolding protein eIF4G1 both in vitro and in the cell.\n\nBackgroundIRES mediated translation initiation requires a different repertoire of factors than canonical cap-dependent translation.\n\nResultsTreatments that inhibit the canonical translation factor eIF4G1 have little or no effect on the ability of the Insr and Igf1r cellular IRESes to promote translation.\n\nConclusionTranscripts for two cellular receptors contain RNA elements that facilitate translation initiation without intact eIF4G1\n\nSignificanceCellular IRES mechanisms may resemble viral type III IRESes allowing them to promote translate with a limited number of initiation factors allowing them to work under stress conditions when canonical translation is repressed.",

With over 44,000 nuclei and 6,000 cells analyzed, the data provide identification of rare cell types, mapping of intermediate steps in differentiation, and the potential to identify new factors impacting fertility or controlling differentiation of germline and supporting somatic cells. We justify assignment of key germline and somatic cell types using combinations of known markers, in situ hybridization, and analysis of extant protein traps. Comparison of single cell and single nucleus datasets proved particularly revealing of dynamic developmental transitions in germline differentiation. To complement the web-based portals for data analysis hosted by the FCA, we provide datasets compatible with commonly used software such as Seurat and Monocle.

    "abstract": "Single-cell genomics and transcriptomics studies enabled us to characterize cell heterogeneity in various tissues, which helped us to better understand the biological system and disease progression. Single-cell proteomics, which directly measures the protein expression level, has the potential to further enhance our knowledge by providing not only a more direct measurement but also crucial information cannot be captured by genomics or transcriptomics study, such as protein activation states and post-translation modification events. One of the main challenges of single-cell proteomics is the large sample loss during sample preparation, which is largely unavoidable using standard proteomics protocols. Protein and peptide loss to the container surface is a well-known phenomenon but often overlooked in larger-scale (>1 {micro}g) proteomics experiments. When it comes to single-cell proteomics with only picograms of protein samples, this loss becomes non-negligible and often dictates the outcomes of the experiment. More importantly, sample processing through multiple pipette tips and containers often introduces random errors, which undermine the ability to detect true heterogenous cellular events. To solve these problems and further improve the throughput and reproducibility of the single-cell proteomics experiments, we developed an automated container-less cell processing platform, utilizing acoustic levitation to process cell samples in the air. Our platform automatically performs cell lysis, protein reduction, alkylation, digestion, and peptide labeling in the air, without any sample transfer step or container. The digested and labeled peptides are then directly injected into the capillary LC-MS/MS system for analysis, eliminating manual steps and conserving most of the sample materials for proteomics analysis. Our initial test shows at least 30% improvement in peptide signals over conventional methods. This process can be performed in parallel to further improve sample processing throughput.",

Here, we report a chemoenzymatic methodology that can provide HS oligosaccharides composed of two or more NS domains separated by NA domains of different length. It is based on the chemical synthesis of a sulfated HS oligosaccharide that enzymatically could be extended by various GlcA-GlcNAc units and terminated in a GlcNAc-6N3 moiety. HS oligosaccharides having an azide and alkyne moiety could assembled by copper catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) to give compounds having various NS domains separated by unsulfated regions.

    "abstract": "In-depth proteome quantitation is of great significance for understanding protein functions, advancing biological, medical, environmental and metabolic engineering research. Herein, benefiting from the high formation efficiencies and intensities of dimethyl-labeled a1 ions for accurate quantitation, we developed an in-depth a1 ion-based proteome quantitation method, named deep-APQ, by a sequential MS/MS acquisition of the high mass range for identification and the low mass range for a1 ion intensity extraction to increase quantitative protein number and sequence coverage. By the analysis of HeLa protein digests, our developed method showed deeper quantitative coverage than our previously reported a1 ion-based quantitation method without mass range segmentation and lower missing values than widely-used label-free quantitation method. It also exhibited excellent accuracy and precision within a 20-fold dynamic range. We further integrated a workflow combining the deep-APQ method with highly efficient sample preparation, high-pH and low-pH reversed-phase separation and high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) to study E. coli proteome responses under the nutritional conditions of glucose and acetate. A total of 3447 proteins were quantified, representing 82% of protein-coding genes, with the average sequence coverage up to 40%, demonstrating the high coverage of quantitation results. We found that most of the quantified proteins related to chemotaxis were differentially expressed, including the low-abundance proteins such as trg, fliL, and cheA, indicating that chemotaxis would play an important role for E. coli cell to survive from acetate toxicity. The above results demonstrated that the deep-APQ method is of great promising to achieve the deep-coverage proteome quantitation with high confidence.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=136 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/501662v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1457bdeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c74e53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e72e9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5cc43_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Previously described effects besides depletion of T cells suggest additional modes of action and identified further cellular targets. Here, we examined the transcriptional changes arising in immune cells from human blood after ex vivo stimulation with ATG on a single cell level to uncover additional mechanisms by which ATG regulates T cell activity and effector functions. Analysis of the paracrine factors present in plasma of ATG-treated whole blood revealed high levels of chemokines and cytokines including Interferon-{gamma} (IFN-{gamma}). Furthermore, we identify an increase of surface expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PDL-1) on monocytes mediated by the released paracrine factors. In addition, we show that this induction is dependent on activation of JAK/STAT signaling via binding of IFN-{gamma} to Interferon-{gamma} receptor 1 (IFN-{gamma}R1). Lastly, we demonstrate that the modulation of the immune-regulatory axis of Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) on activated CD8+ T cells with PDL-1 found on monocytes mediated by ATG potently inhibits effector functions including proliferation and granzyme B release of activated T cells.

NETs trap and kill microbes but have also been linked to inflammation, e.g. atherosclerosis, arthritis or psoriasis by unknown mechanisms. We here characterize naRNA (NET-associated RNA), as a new canonical, abundant, and unexplored inflammatory NET component. naRNA, upon release by NET formation, drove further NET formation in naive PMN, and induced macrophage and keratinocyte activation via TLR8 in humans and Tlr13 in mice, in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in vivo naRNA strongly drove skin inflammation, whereas genetic ablation of RNA sensing drastically ameliorated psoriatic skin inflammation. Rather than accidentally assembling with LL37 on the NET, naRNA was intracellularly pre-associated in resting neutrophils as a  composite DAMP, thus highlighting NET formation as a DAMP release process. This re-defines sterile NETs as an intentionally inflammatory agent, signaling and amplifying neutrophil activation. Moreover, in the many conditions previously linked to NETs and extracellular RNA, TLR-mediated naRNA sensing emerges as both potential cause and new intervention target.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/499571v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (94K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11b866org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16139ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a2905org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b0e7e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Created with biorender.com",

    "abstract": "The LILRB4 myeloid receptor has been implicated in an immunosuppressive microenvironment, with specific antibodies under preclinical or clinical development for tumor immunotherapy. However, it remains largely unknown which natural ligand may trigger LILRB4 to expand myeloid derived suppressive cells (MDSC), and the relevant downstream signaling pathways are also under debate. Here we show that Galectin-8 is a high-affinity functional ligand of LILRB4, and its ligation induces MDSC by activating STAT3 as well as inhibiting NF-{kappa}B. Importantly, Galectin-8 but not APOE could induce MDSC, and both ligands bind LILRB4 in a non-competitive manner. Antibodies recognizing a defined epitope on LILRB4 could efficiently block Galectin-8 binding and neutralize its effects on MDSC induction and relevant signaling pathways. Galectin-8 expression promoted B16 tumor growth in mice, and knockout of LILRB4 attenuated tumor growth in this context. The LILRB4-specific Galectin-8 blocking antibody efficiently suppressed MDSC expansion and tumor growth in vivo. These results identify Galectin-8 as a functionally important ligand of LILRB4, highlighting the blockade of LILRB4-Galectin-8 interaction as a promising strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Rapid proliferation of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium falciparum in the human blood depends on a particularly divergent and acentriolar centrosome, which incorporates several essential centrins. Centrins are small calcium-binding proteins that have a variety of roles and are universally associated with eukaryotic centrosomes. Their precise mode of action, however, remains unclear. In this study calcium-inducible liquid-liquid phase separation is revealed as an evolutionary conserved principle of assembly for Plasmodium and human centrins. Furthermore, the disordered N-terminus and calcium-binding motifs are defined as essential features for reversible biomolecular condensation and demonstrate that certain centrins can co-condensate. In vivo analysis using live-cell STED microscopy shows liquid-like dynamics of centrosomal centrin. Additionally, implementation of an inducible protein overexpression system reveals concentration-dependent formation of extra-centrosomal centrin assemblies with condensate-like properties. The timing of foci formation and dissolution suggests that centrin assembly is regulated. This study thereby provides a new model for centrin accumulation at eukaryotic centrosomes.",

    "abstract": "Bidirectional DNA replication complexes initiated from the same origin remain colocalized in a factory configuration for part or all of their lifetimes. However, there is little evidence that sister replisomes are functionally interdependent, and the consequence of factory replication is unknown. Here, we investigated the functional relationship between sister replisomes in E. coli, which naturally exhibits both factory and solitary configurations in the same replication cycle. Using an inducible transcription factor roadblocking system, we found that blocking one replisome caused a significant decrease in overall progression and velocity of the sister replisome. Remarkably, progression was impaired only if the block occurred while sister replisomes were still in a factory configuration - blocking one fork had no significant effect on the other replisome when sister replisomes were physically separate. Disruption of factory replication also led to increased fork stalling and requirement of fork restart mechanisms. These results suggest that physical association between sister replisomes is important for establishing an efficient and uninterrupted replication program. We discuss the implications of our findings on mechanisms of replication factory structure and function, and cellular strategies of replicating problematic DNA such as highly transcribed segments.",

    "abstract": "Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is associated with deficiency of the receptor tyrosine kinase RET, resulting in loss of cells of the enteric nervous system (ENS) during fetal gut development. The major contribution to HSCR risk is from common sequence variants in RET enhancers with additional risk from rare coding variants in many genes. Here, we demonstrate that these RET enhancer variants specifically alter the human fetal gut development program through significant decreases in gene expression of RET, members of the RET-EDNRB gene regulatory network (GRN), other HSCR genes, and an altered transcriptome with 2,382 differentially expressed genes with diverse neuronal and mesenchymal functions. A parsimonious hypothesis for these results is that beyond RETs direct effect on its GRN, it also has a major role in enteric neural crest derived cell (ENCDC) precursor proliferation, its deficiency reducing ENCDCs with relative expansion of non-ENCDC cells. Thus, genes reducing RET proliferative activity can potentially cause HSCR. One such class is the 23 RET-dependent transcription factors enriched in early gut development. We show that their knockdown in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells reduces RET and/or EDNRB gene expression, expanding the RET-EDNRB GRN. The human embryos we studied had major remodeling of the gut transcriptional but were unlikely to have had HSCR: thus, genetic changes in addition to those in RET are required for a significant enough reduction in ENCDCs to cause aganglionosis.",

    "abstract": "Bioanalytical techniques for the isolation and quantification of total lipids in biological samples are an integral part of lipidomic workflows and widely used tools for metabolic assessment at the cellular and organismic levels. The most widely used protocol for the isolation, extraction, and quantification of total lipids in biological tissues was originally introduced by Folch et al.. It requires a relatively large amount of tissue and large volumes of lipid extracts for reliable assessment of lipid content using the gravimetric technique. Here, we propose a new method to overcome the aforementioned challenges based on the hypothesis that the partitioning coefficient of the widely used lysochrome diazo dye Sudan Black B between the lipid extract and ethylene glycol can be used to indirectly estimate the absolute concentration of lipids. The proposed method demonstrates great precision and linearity, requires minimal equipment, and enables the analysis of total lipid content in biological specimens available only in limited amounts by reducing the requirements for the input quantity by >300-fold for some tissues (e.g. fecal samples).",

    "abstract": "DNA hypermethylation is a hallmark of cancer and predominantly affects CpG island regions. Although this phenomenon was first described more than three decades ago, its mechanisms have remained unknown. Since CpG island hypermethylation is strongly biased towards Polycomb target genes, we reasoned that dysfunction of Polycomb repression complexes (PRCs) may underlie CpG island hypermethylation. We observed that a few genes coding for components of the PRC1 complex are downregulated in many cancer types. We focused on RYBP, a key activator of variant PRC1 complexes responsible for H2AK119 monoubiquitylation. We inactivated RYBP in nontumorigenic bronchial epithelial cells and observed a limited extent of DNA hypermethylation. Considering that tumors are deficient in 5-methylcytosine oxidase (TET protein) function as documented by substantially reduced levels of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in all solid tumors, we then inactivated TET1, TET2, and TET3 in bronchial cells, individually and in combination. Using quadruple knockouts of RYBP and all three TET proteins, we observed widespread hypermethylation of H2AK119Ub1-marked CpG islands affecting almost 4,000 target genes. This hypermethylation closely mirrored the DNA hypermethylation landscape observed in human lung tumors. These cells showed aberrant methylation and dysregulation of several cancer-relevant pathways including cell cycle control genes, defects in the Hippo pathway and overexpression of AP-1 transcription factor genes. As a result, the quadruple knockout bronchial cells acquired properties of a transformed phenotype, including efficient growth in soft agar and formation of squamous cell carcinomas in immune-compromised mice. Our data provide a long- sought mechanism for DNA hypermethylation in cancer and explain how such hypermethylation leads to cell transformation. Cancer formation, therefore, is achievable by misregulation of two epigenetic pathways without introduction of cancer driver mutations.",

    "abstract": "Foraging involves innate decision heuristics that are adapted for the wild but can cause economically suboptimal cognitive biases in some contexts. The mechanisms underlying cognitive biases are poorly understood but are likely genetic. Here, we investigate foraging in fasted mice using a naturalistic paradigm and uncover an innate \"second-guessing\" cognitive bias that involves repeatedly investigating an empty former food patch instead of consuming available food. Second-guessing prevents mice from maximizing feeding benefits in the task. Since learning and memory are involved, we tested roles for the synaptic plasticity gene, Arc, and found that Arc-/- mice show a specific lack of second-guessing. Arc-/- males reap benefits by increasing food consumption. Unsupervised machine learning decompositions of foraging show that Arc affects discrete, stereotyped foraging sequences that we call modules within a rich naturalistic behavioral landscape. Thus, our study reports a second- guessing cognitive bias, ethological roles for Arc in naturalistic foraging, and links between genetically determined foraging modules and cognitive bias in decision making.",

    "abstract": "The organization of neural circuits determines nervous system function. Variability can arise during neural circuit development (e.g. neurite morphology, axon/dendrite position). To ensure robust nervous system function, mechanisms must exist to accommodate variation in neurite positioning during circuit formation. Previously we developed a model system in the Drosophila ventral nerve cord to conditionally induce positional variability of a proprioceptive sensory axon terminal, and used this model to show that when we altered the presynaptic position of the sensory neuron, its major postsynaptic interneuron partner modified its dendritic arbor to match the presynaptic contact, resulting in functional synaptic input (Sales et al., 2019). Here we investigate the cellular mechanisms by which the interneuron dendrites detect and match variation in presynaptic partner location and input strength. We manipulate the presynaptic sensory neuron by (a) ablation; (b) silencing or activation; or (c) altering its location in the neuropil. From these experiments we conclude that there are two opposing mechanisms used to establish functional connectivity in the face of presynaptic variability: presynaptic contact stimulates dendrite outgrowth locally, whereas presynaptic activity inhibits postsynaptic dendrite outgrowth globally. These mechanisms are only active during an early larval critical period for structural plasticity. Collectively, our data provide new insights into dendrite development, identifying mechanisms that allow dendrites to flexibly and robustly respond to developmental variability in presynaptic location and input strength.",

    "abstract": "Fluid intelligence - the ability to solve novel, complex problems - declines steeply during healthy human aging. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), fluid intelligence has been repeatedly associated with activation of a frontoparietal brain network, and focal damage to these regions suggests that fluid intelligence depends on their integrity. It is therefore possible that age-related functional differences in frontoparietal activity contribute to the reduction in fluid intelligence. This paper reports on analysis of the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (Cam-CAN) data, a large, population-based, healthy, adult lifespan cohort. The data support a model in which age-related differences in fluid intelligence are partially mediated by the responsiveness of frontoparietal regions to novel problem-solving. We first replicate a prior finding of such mediation using an independent sample. We then precisely localise the mediating brain regions, and show that mediation is specifically associated with voxels most activated by cognitive demand, but not with voxels suppressed by cognitive demand. We quantify the robustness of this result to potential unmodelled confounders, and estimate the causal direction of the effects. Finally, exploratory analyses suggest that neural mediation of age-related differences in fluid intelligence is moderated by the variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration. An additional moderating role of the variety of non-physical activities emerged when controlling for head motion. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link healthy aging with lower fluid intelligence may suggest strategies for mitigating such decline.\n\nSignificance StatementGlobal populations are living longer, driving urgency to understand age-related cognitive declines. Fluid intelligence is of prime importance, because it reflects performance across many domains, and declines especially steeply during healthy aging. Despite consensus that fluid intelligence is associated with particular frontoparietal brain regions, little research has investigated suggestions that under-responsiveness of these regions mediates age-related decline. We replicate a recent demonstration of such mediation, showing specific association with brain regions most activated by cognitive demand, and robustness to moderate confounding by unmodelled variables. By showing that this mediation model is moderated by the variety of regular physical activities, more reliably than by their frequency or duration, we identify a potential modifiable lifestyle factor that may help promote successful aging.",

    "abstract": "The global signal (GS) in resting-state fMRI, known to contain artifacts and non-neuronal physiological signals, also contains important neural information related to individual state and trait characteristics. Here we show distinct linear and curvilinear lifespan patterns of GS topography in a cross-sectional lifespan sample, demonstrating its importance for consideration in studies of development and aging. Subcortical brain regions such as the thalamus and putamen show linear associations with the GS across the lifespan. The thalamus has stronger coupling in older-age individuals compared with younger-aged individuals, while the putamen has stronger coupling in younger individuals compared with older individuals. The subcortical nucleus basalis shows a u-shaped pattern similar to cortical regions within the lateral frontoparietal network and dorsal attention network, where coupling with the GS is stronger at early and old age, with weaker coupling in middle age. This differentiation in coupling strength between subcortical and cortical brain activity across the lifespan supports a dual-layer model of GS composition, where subcortical aspects of the GS are differentiated from cortical aspects of the GS. We find that these subcortical-cortical contributions to the GS depend strongly on the lifespan stage of individuals. Our findings demonstrate how neurobiological information within the GS differs across development and highlight the need to carefully consider whether or not to remove this signal when investigating age-related functional differences in the brain.",
