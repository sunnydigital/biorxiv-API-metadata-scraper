    "abstract": "The high abundance of most viruses in infected host cells benefits their structural characterization; endogenous viruses are present in low copy numbers, however, and are therefore challenging to investigate. Here, we retrieve cell extracts enriched with an endogenous virus, the yeast L-A virus. The determined cryo-EM structure discloses capsid-stabilizing cation-{pi} stacking and an interplay of non-covalent interactions from ten distinct capsomere interfaces. The capsid-embedded mRNA decapping active site trench is supported by a constricting movement of two opposite-facing loops. tRNA-loaded polysomes and other biomacromolecules, presumably mRNA, are found in virus proximity while stacked dsRNA bundles and the sub-stoichiometric polymerase localize underneath the capsid surface. Mature viruses participate in larger viral communities resembling their rare in-cell equivalents in terms of size, composition, and inter-virus distances. Our results collectively describe a 3D-architecture of a viral milieu, opening the door to cellextract-based high-resolution structural virology.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can be genetically engineered to act as therapeutic delivery vehicles in the treatment of tumors, killing cancer cells or activating the immune system. This is known as Bacteria-Mediated Cancer Therapy (BMCT). Tumor invasion, colonization and tumor regression are major biological events, which are directly associated with antitumor effects and are uncontrollable due to the influence of tumor microenvironments during the BMCT process. Here, we developed a genetic circuit for dynamically programming bacterial lifestyles (planktonic, biofilm or lysis), to precisely manipulate the process of bacterial adhesion, colonization and drug release in BMCT process, via hierarchical modulation of the lighting power density (LPD) of near-infrared (NIR) light. The deep tissue penetration of NIR offers us a modality for spatiotemporal and noninvasive control of bacterial genetic circuits in vivo. By combining computational modeling with high throughput characterization device, we optimized the genetic circuits in engineered bacteria to program the process of bacterial lifestyle transitions by altering the illumination scheme of NIR. Our results showed that programming intratumoral bacterial lifestyle transitions allows precise control of multiple key steps throughout the BMCT process, and therapeutic efficacy can be greatly improved by controlling the localization and dosage of therapeutic agents via optimizing the illumination scheme.",

    "abstract": "We describe construction of the 660 kilobase synthetic yeast chromosome XI (synXI) and reveal how synthetic redesign of non-coding DNA elements impact the cell. To aid construction from synthesized 5 to 10 kilobase DNA fragments, we implemented CRISPR-based methods for synthetic crossovers in vivo and used these methods in an extensive process of bug discovery, redesign and chromosome repair, including for the precise removal of 200 kilobases of unexpected repeated sequence. In synXI, the underlying causes of several fitness defects were identified as modifications to non-coding DNA, including defects related to centromere function and mitochondrial activity that were subsequently corrected. As part of synthetic yeast chromosome design, loxPsym sequences for Cre-mediated recombination are inserted between most genes. Using the GAP1 locus from chromosome XI, we show here that targeted insertion of these sites can be used to create extrachromosomal circular DNA on demand, allowing direct study of the effects and propagation of these important molecules. Construction and characterization of synXI has uncovered effects of non-coding and extrachromosomal circular DNA, contributing to better understanding of these elements and informing future synthetic genome design.",

    "abstract": "Over the course of aging, there is an early degradation of cerebrovascular health that may be attenuated with aerobic exercise training. Yet, the acute cerebrovascular response to a single bout of exercise remains elusive, particularly within key brain regions most affected by age-related disease processes. We investigated the acute global and region-specific cerebral blood flow (CBF) response to 15 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise in older adults ([&ge;]65years) (n=60) using arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging. Within 0-6 minutes post-exercise, CBF decreased across all regions, an effect that was attenuated in the hippocampus. The exercise-induced CBF drop was followed by a rebound effect over the 24-minute post-exercise assessment period, an effect that was most robust in the hippocampus. Individuals with low baseline perfusion demonstrated the greatest hippocampal-specific CBF effect post-exercise, showing no immediate drop and a rapid increase in CBF that exceeded baseline levels within 6-12 minutes post-exercise. Gains in domain-specific cognitive performance post-exercise were not associated with changes in regional CBF, suggesting dissociable effects of exercise on acute neural and vascular plasticity. Together, the present findings support a precision-medicine framework for the use of exercise to target brain health that carefully considers age-related changes in the cerebrovascular system.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a range of behavioral alterations including memory loss as well as cognitive and psychiatric symptoms. While there is growing evidence that cellular and molecular pathologies, such as the accumulation of amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques may contribute to AD, it remains unclear how this histopathology can give rise to such disparate behavioral deficits. One hypothesis for these diverse behavioral presentations is that A{beta} accumulation has differential effects on neuronal circuits across brain regions, depending on the diverse neurophysiological properties and connections within and between the neurons in these different areas. To test this, we recorded from large neuronal populations in the dorsal and ventral CA1 regions of the hippocampus, areas that are known to be structurally and functionally diverse, in both APP/PS1 animals, a mouse model of A{beta} pathology, and age-matched C57BL/6 controls. Although we found similar levels of A{beta} pathology in the two subregions, populations of neurons in dorsal and ventral CA1 in APP/PS1 mice showed distinct signatures of disrupted neuronal activity as animals navigated a virtual reality environment. In dorsal CA1, pairwise correlations and entropy, a measure of the diversity of activity patterns, were decreased in the APP/PS1 mice. However, in ventral CA1, the opposite findings were observed; pair-wise correlations and entropy was increased in APP/PS1 mice relative to C57BL/6 controls. When we attempted to connect the microscopic features of population activity (the correlations) with the macroscopic features of the population code (the entropy) using a pairwise Ising model, we found that the models performance decreased in predicting dorsal CA1 activity but increased in predicting vCA1 activity in APP/PS1 mice, as compared to the C57BL/6 animals. Taken together, these findings suggest that A{beta} pathology exerts distinct effects across different hippocampal regions. Our results suggest that the diverse behavioral deficits associated with AD and the cellular pathology that arises from A{beta} accumulation may be mechanistically linked by studying the dynamics of neural activity within these diverse hippocampal circuits.",

We find multiple looming responsive DN integrate looming information across both eyes, even though their dendrites are unilateral. One DN in particular, the giant fibers (GF), generates invariant looming responses across approach directions. We confirm visual information propagates to the GF from the contralateral eye through an as of yet unidentified pathway and demonstrate the absence of this pathway alters GF responses to looming stimuli from the ipsilateral eye. Our data highlight a role for bilateral visual integration in generating consistent escape responses that are robust across a wide range of stimulus locations and parameters.",

    "abstract": "In both steady-state and during endotoxicosis, liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) can rapidly clear lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from the bloodstream. They are located along blood sinusoids of the liver, and establish intimate contact with circulating and tissue-resident immune cells. However, their role in regulating immune responses during LPS-induced endotoxicosis remains poorly understood. Here, we show that LSECs play a dual role in regulating inflammatory responses, acting as modulators of NK cell pro-inflammatory output and as major producers of immune cell-attracting chemokines. We demonstrate that LSECs switch their chemokine expression pattern driven by LPS and IFN-{gamma}, resulting in the production of the myeloid-attracting chemokine CCL2 and the lymphoid-attracting chemokine CXCL10, which accumulate in the serum of LPS-challenged animals. In livers of LPS-injected mice, monocytes and Kupffer cells expressed highest amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine Il12a and Il18 transcripts, while NK cells expressed the highest amounts of Ifng. NK cell exposure to LSECs in vitro led to global transcriptomic changes, and primed NK cells to produce higher amounts of IFN-{gamma} in response to IL-12 and IL-18. LSECs required exposure to IFN-{gamma} for Cxcl10 expression, and Cxcl10 gene-deletion in endothelial cells abrogated NK cell accumulation in the liver after LPS treatment. Thus, our data indicate that LSECs occupy a unique temporal and spatial position acting as central regulators that respond to both LPS and immune-derived inflammatory signals, and fuel a positive feedback loop of immune cell attraction and activation in the inflamed liver tissue.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=96 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500206v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@653c53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5ba4bdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9caad8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1945eb5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "FtsK/SpoIIIE protein family are DNA translocases known as the fastest DNA motor proteins that use ATP for their movement on DNA. Most of the studies in single chromosome-containing bacteria have established the role of FtsK in chromosome dimer resolution (CDR) connecting the bacterial chromosome segregation process with cell division. But, only limited reports are available on the interdependent regulation of genome segregation and cell division in multipartite genome harbouring (MGH) bacteria. In this study, for the first time, we report the characterization of FtsK from the radioresistant MGH bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans R1 (drFtsK). drFtsK shows the activity characteristics of a typical FtsK/SpoIIIE/Tra family. It stimulates the site-specific recombination catalyzed by Escherichia coli tyrosine recombinases. drFtsK interacts with various cell division and genome segregation proteins of D. radiodurans. Microscopic examination of different domain deletion mutants of this protein reveals alterations in cellular membrane architecture and nucleoid morphology. In-vivo localization studies of drFtsK-RFP show that it forms multiple foci on nucleoid as well as on the membrane with maximum density on the septum. drFtsK coordinates its movement with nucleoid separation. The alignment of its foci shifts from old to new septum indicating its cellular dynamics with the FtsZ ring during the cell division process. Nearly, similar positional dynamicity of FtsK was observed in cells recovering from gamma radiation exposure. These results suggest that FtsK forms a part of chromosome segregation, cell envelope, and cell division machinery in D. radiodurans.\n\nImportanceDeinococcus radiodurans show extraordinary resistance to {gamma}-radiation. It is polyploid and harbours a multipartite genome comprised of two chromosomes and two plasmids, packaged in a doughnut-shaped toroidal nucleoid. Very little is known about how the tightly packed genome is accurately segregated and the next divisional plane is determined. FtsK, a multifunctional protein, helps in pumping the septum-trapped DNA in several bacteria. Here, we characterized FtsK of D. radiodurans R1 (drFtsK) for the first time and showed it to be an active protein. The absence of drFtsK causes many defects in morphology at both cellular and nucleoid levels. The compact packaging of the deinococcal genome and cell membrane formation is hindered in ftsK mutants. In-vivo drFtsK is dynamic, forms foci on both nucleoid and septum, and coordinates with FtsZ for the next cell division. Thus, drFtsK role in maintaining the normal genome phenotype and cell division in Deinococcus radiodurans is suggested.",

The cellular and molecular mechanisms driving the formation of these epithelial breaks are only starting to be investigated. Here, we studied the formation of the zebrafish nostril (the olfactory orifice), which opens in the skin epithelium to expose the olfactory neurons to external odorant cues. Combining live imaging, drug treatments, laser ablation and tissue-specific functional perturbations, we demonstrate that the formation of the orifice is driven by a mechanical interplay between the olfactory placode neurons and the skin: the neurons pull on the overlying skin cells in an actomyosin-dependent manner, thus triggering the opening of the orifice. This work unravels an original mechanism to break an epithelial sheet, in which an adjacent group of cells instructs and mechanically assists the epithelium to induce its local rupture.",

    "abstract": "Maize is a staple food of smallholder farmers living in highland regions up to 4,000 meters above sea level worldwide. Mexican and South American highlands are two major highland maize growing regions, and population genetic data suggests the maizes adaptation to these regions occurred largely independently, providing a case study for parallel evolution. To better understand the mechanistic basis of highland adaptation, we crossed maize landraces from 108 highland and lowland sites of Mexico and South America with the inbred line B73 to produce F1 hybrids and grew them in both highland and lowland sites in Mexico. We identified thousands of genes with divergent expression between highland and lowland populations. Hundreds of these genes show patterns of convergent evolution between Mexico and South America. To dissect the genetic architecture of the divergent gene expression, we developed a novel allele-specific expression analysis pipeline to detect genes with divergent functional cis-regulatory variation between highland and lowland populations. We identified hundreds of genes with divergent cis-regulation between highland and lowland landrace alleles, with 20 in common between regions, further suggesting convergence in the genes underlying highland adaptation. Further analyses suggest multiple mechanisms contribute to this convergence. Our findings reveal a complex genetic architecture of cis-regulatory alleles underlying adaptation to highlands in maize. Although the vast majority of evolutionary changes associated with highland adaptation were region-specific, our findings highlight an important role for convergence at the gene expression and gene regulation levels as well.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is an important crop for both food and oil, providing high quality protein and oil for humans and animals. Drought stress has an significant effect on the yield and quality of soybean. In the early vegetative stage of soybean, the developed root system can effectively improve the tolerance of soybean plant to drought. Xyloglucan endoglycosylase/hydrolase (XTH) is a cell wall remodeling enzyme involved in cell wall expansion and degradation. However, there are few studies on XTHs regulation of root growth and response to drought stress in soybean seedlings.The objectives of this study were to clone GmXTH1 gene and determine the effects of over and interference-expression of GmXTH1 on soybean root development at seedling stage. A 1,015 bp full-length of the GmXTH1 gene was cloned from soybean (Glycine max L. Merril) cv. RM18 with a 840 bp open reading frame (ORF) of a putative protein. The over and interference expression vectors of GmXTH1 were transformed into soybean using Agrobacterium method. Transformed strains OEA1, OEA3, IEA4, IEA5 were identified by molecular detection methods. The roots of transformed strains OEA1and OEA3 with GmXTH1 gene overexpression are clearly developed and the root phenotypic attributes, including main root length, primary root number, lateral root length, root surface area, root volume, root dry weight, root fresh weight are higher than the control. In contrast, root attributes of IEA4 and IEA5 with GmXTH1 gene interference expression were significantly lower than those of the control, suggesting that the expression of GmXTH1 gene has an important effect on the soybean root growth and development at seedling stage. Under drought stress conditions, the activities of Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Peroxidase(POD)and Catalase(CAT)in the transgenic strains with an overexpression of the GmXTH1 gene were significantly increased, and the root activity, leaf relative water content and total chlorophyll content were ranked in order of OEAs, CK, and IEAs. In conclusion, GmXHT1 plays an important role in the growth of soybean root at seedling stage. Overexpression of GmXTH1 gene can promote root development of soybean seedling. The results of activities of protective enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT), root activity, leaf relative water content and total chlorophyll content under drought stress indicated that transgenic strains OEA1 and OEA3 with overexpressing GmXTH1 gene were resistant to drought stress, suggesting that GmXTH1 may play a positive role in responding to drought stress at soybean seedling stage.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 system aids generation of knock-in zebrafish lines, but it has been hard to integrate large constructs and avoid disrupting the targeted genes. Here we devised a 3 knock-in strategy of PCR-amplified dsDNA, which coded for fluorescence proteins and Cre recombinase in frame with the endogenous gene but separated from each other by self-cleavable peptides. Primers with 5 AmC6 end-protections generated improved PCR amplicons harboring either short or long homologous arms, which were co-injected with pre-assembled Cas9/gRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes for early integration. We targeted four genetic loci (krt92, nkx6.1, krt4, and id2a) and generated ten knock-in lines, which function as reporters for the endogenous gene expression. The knocked-in iCre or CreERT2 were used for lineage tracing, which suggested nkx6.1+ cells are multipotent pancreatic progenitors that gradually restrict to bipotent duct; while id2a+ cells are multipotent in both liver and pancreas and gradually restrict to ductal cells. Additionally, hepatic id2a+ duct show progenitor properties upon extreme hepatocyte loss. Thus, we present an efficient knock-in technique with widespread use for both cellular labelling and lineage tracing.",

Although murine models have proved useful in biomedical research, rodent models often fail to adequately mimic human physiology and disease progression, resulting in poor preclinical prediction of therapeutic drug efficacy and toxicity. With the advent of organoid technology, many of these challenges can be overcome. Previously, the use of canine organoids in drug testing and disease modeling was limited to organoids originating from the intestine, liver, kidney, and urinary bladder. Here, we report the cultivation, maintenance, and molecular characterization of three novel adult-stem cell-derived canine organoid cell lines, including the endometrium, lung, and pancreas, in addition to previously reported kidney, bladder, and liver organoids from two genetically related canines. Six tissues and organoid lines from each donor were characterized using bulk RNASeq, allowing for a unique, multi-organ comparison between these two individuals and identification of specific cell types such as glandular epithelial cells in endometrial organoids.",

Here, we evaluated whether birds from five cities in five countries (Czech Republic - Prague, Finland - Rovaniemi, Hungary - Budapest, Poland - Poznan, and Australia - Melbourne) changed their tolerance towards human presence (measured as flight initiation distance) during the COVID-19 shutdowns. We collected 6369 flight initiation distance estimates for 147 bird species and found that birds tolerated approaching humans to a similar level before and during the COVID-19 shutdowns. Moreover, during the shutdowns, bird escape behaviour did not consistently change with the level of governmental restrictions (measured as the stringency index). Hence, our results indicate that birds do not flexibly and quickly adjust their escape behaviour to the reduced human presence; in other words, the breeding populations of urban birds examined might already be tolerant of human activity and perceive humans as relatively harmless.",

As novel and improved immunotherapies may fill this need, we dissected the immunoregulatory interactions in neuroblastoma by single-cell RNA-sequencing of 25 tumors (10 pre- and 15 post-chemotherapy, including 5 pairs) to identify strategies for optimizing immunotherapy efficacy. Neuroblastomas were infiltrated by NK, T and B cells, and immunosuppressive myeloid populations. NK cells showed reduced cytotoxicity and T cells had a dysfunctional profile. Interaction analysis revealed a vast immunoregulatory network and identified NECTIN2-TIGIT as a crucial immune checkpoint. Combined blockade of TIGIT and PD-L1 significantly reduced neuroblastoma growth, with complete responses in vivo. Moreover, addition of TIGIT blockade to standard relapse treatment in a chemotherapy-resistant Th-ALKF1174L/MYCN 129/SvJ syngeneic model significantly improved survival.

    "abstract": "Xenobiotics are chemicals foreign to a specific organism that humans are exposed to on a daily basis through their food, drugs and the environment. These molecules are frequently metabolized to increase polarity and subsequent excretion. During sample preparation, deconjugation of phase II metabolites is a critical step to capture the total exposure to chemicals in liquid chromatography mass spectrometry assays (LC-MS). Knowledge on deconjugation efficiencies of different enzymes and the extend of conjugation in human biofluids has primarily been investigated for single compounds or individual chemical classes. In this study, the performance of three {beta}-glucuronidase and arylsulfatase mixtures from H. pomatia, from recombinant sources (BGS), and from Escherichia coli combined with recombinant arylsulfatase (ASPC) was compared and the efficiency of phase II deconjugation was monitored in breast milk, urine and plasma. An innovative LC-MS/MS biomonitoring method encompassing more than 80 highly diverse xenobiotics (e.g., plasticizers, industrial chemicals, mycotoxins, phytoestrogens, pesticides) was utilized for the comprehensive investigation of phase II conjugation in experiments investigating levels in breast milk and urine obtained from breastfeeding women. Overall, it was confirmed that H. pomatia is the most efficient enzyme in hydrolyzing different classes of xenobiotics for future exposome-scale biomonitoring studies. The recombinant BGS formulation, however, provided better results for breast milk samples, primarily due to lower background contamination, a major issue when employing the typically applied crude H. pomatia extracts. A deeper understanding of the global xenobiotic conjugation patterns will be essential for capturing environmental and food-related exposures within the exposome framework more comprehensively.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/500202v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4fbe48org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15588edorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@90b394org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fde3e5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, how these fate decisions are regulated is unknown. Here, we show that the positioning of an auxin signalling maximum within the cambium determines the fate of stem cell daughters. The position is modulated by gibberellin-regulated, PIN1-dependent polar auxin transport. Gibberellin treatment broadens auxin maximum from the xylem side of the cambium towards the phloem. As a result, xylem-side stem cell daughter preferentially differentiates into xylem, while phloem-side daughter retains stem cell identity. Occasionally, this broadening leads to direct specification of both daughters as xylem, and consequently, adjacent phloem-identity cell reverts to being stem cell. Conversely, reduced gibberellin levels favour specification of phloem-side stem cell daughter as phloem. Together, our data provide a mechanism by which gibberellin regulates the ratio of xylem and phloem production.",

    "abstract": "Among the numerous genetic tools developed for yeast, CRISPR/Cas system has been a widely used genome editing method thanks to its sophistication. However, CRISPR methods for yeast generally rely on pre-assembled DNAs and extra cloning steps to deliver gRNA, Cas protein, and donor DNA. These laborious steps might hinder its usefulness. Here, we propose a convenient, rapid, standardizable CRISPR method, named Assembly and CRISPR-targeted in vivo Editing (ACtivE), which only relies on in vivo assembly of linear DNA fragments for both plasmid and donor DNA construction. Thus, depending on the users need, these parts can be easily selected and combined from a repository, serving as a toolkit for rapid genome editing without any expensive reagent. The toolkit contains verified linear DNA fragments, which are easy to store, share and transport at room temperature, drastically reducing expensive shipping costs and assembly time. After optimizing this technique, eight ARS-close loci in the yeast genome were also characterized in terms of integration and gene expression efficiencies and the impacts of the disruptions of these regions on cell fitness. The flexibility and multiplexing capacity of the ACtivE were shown by constructing {beta}-carotene pathway. In only a few days, > 80% integration efficiency for single gene integration and > 50% integration efficiency for triplex integration were achieved from scratch without using in vitro DNA assembly methods, restriction enzymes, or extra cloning steps. This study presents a standardizable method to be readily employed to accelerate yeast genome engineering and provides well-defined genomic location alternatives for yeast synthetic biology and metabolic engineering purposes.",

    "abstract": "Applications of synthetic biology spanning human health, industrial bioproduction, and ecosystem monitoring often require small molecule sensing capabilities, typically in the form of genetically encoded small molecule biosensors. Critical to the deployment of greater numbers of these systems are methods that support the rapid development of such biosensors against a broad range of small molecule targets. Here, we use a previously developed method for selection of RNA biosensors against unmodified small molecules (DRIVER) to perform a selection against a densely multiplexed mixture of small molecules, representative of those employed in high-throughput drug screening. Using a mixture of 5,120 target compounds randomly sampled from a large diversity drug screening library, we performed a 95-round selection and then analyzed the enriched RNA biosensor library using next generation sequencing (NGS). From our analysis, we identified RNA biosensors with at least 2-fold change in signal in the presence of at least 217 distinct target compounds with sensitivities down to 25 nM. Although many of these biosensors respond to multiple targets, clustering analysis indicated at least 150 different small-molecule sensing patterns. We also built a classifier that was able to predict whether the biosensors would respond to a new compound with an average precision of 0.82. Since the target compound library was designed to be representative of larger diversity compound libraries, we expect that the described approach can be used with similar compound libraries to identify aptamers against other small molecules with a similar success rate. The new RNA biosensors (or their component aptamers) described in this work can be further optimized and used in applications such as biosensing, gene control, or enzyme evolution. In addition, the data presented here provide an expanded compendium of new RNA aptamers compared to the 82 small molecule RNA aptamers published in the literature, allowing further bioinformatic analyses of the general classes of small molecules for which RNA aptamers can be found.",

However, we lack a general understanding of how TCRms engage pMHC targets, which is crucial for predicting their specificity and safety. Several new structures of TCRm:pMHC complexes have become available in the past year, providing sufficient initial data for a holistic analysis of TCRms as a class of pMHC binding agents. Here, we profile the complete set of TCRm:pMHC complexes against representative TCR:pMHC complexes to quantify the TCR-likeness of their pMHC engagement. We find that intrinsic molecular differences between antibodies and TCRs lead to fundamentally different roles for their heavy/light chains and Complementarity-Determining Region loops during antigen recognition. The idiotypic properties of antibodies may increase the likelihood of TCRms engaging pMHCs with less peptide selectivity than TCRs. However, the pMHC recognition features of some TCRms, including the two TCRms currently in clinical trials, can be remarkably TCR-like. The insights gained from this study will aid in the rational design and optimisation of next-generation TCRms.",

Two of the 4,417,942 base-pair long H37Rv assemblies were 100% identical, with the third differing by a single nucleotide. Compared to the existing H37Rv reference, the new sequence contained approximately 6.4 kb additional base pairs encoding ten new regions.

    "abstract": "The circadian clock controls behavior and metabolism in various organisms. However, the exact timing and strength of rhythmic phenotypes can vary significantly between individuals of the same species. This is highly relevant for the rhythmically complex marine environments where organismal rhythmic diversity likely permits the occupation of different microenvironments. When investigating circadian locomotor behavior of Platynereis dumerilii, a model system for marine molecular chronobiology, we found strain-specific, high variability between individual worms. The individual patterns were reproducibly maintained for several weeks independent of basic culture conditions, such as population density or feeding. A diel head transcriptome comparison of behaviorally rhythmic versus arrhythmic wildtype worms showed that 24h cycling of core circadian clock transcripts is identical between both behavioral phenotypes. While behaviorally arrhythmic worms showed a similar total number of cycling transcripts compared to their behaviorally rhythmic counterparts, the annotation categories of their transcripts, however, differed substantially. Consistent with their locomotor phenotype, behaviorally rhythmic worms exhibit an enrichment of cycling transcripts related to neuronal/behavioral processes. In contrast, behaviorally arrhythmic worms showed significantly increased diel cycling for metabolism- and physiology-related transcripts. Phenotype-specific cycling of distinct matrix metalloproteinase transcripts, encoding extracellular enzymes that modulate synaptic circuit function and neuropeptide signaling, like pigment dispersing factor (PDF), prompted us to functionally investigate Platynereis pdf. Differing from its role in Drosophila, loss of pdf impacts on overall activity levels, but shows only indirect effects on rhythmicity. Our results show that individuals arrhythmic in a given process can show increased rhythmicity in others. Across the Platynereis population, variations of this exist as a reproducible continuum. We hypothesize that such diel rhythm breadth is an important biodiversity resource enabling the species to quickly adapt to heterogeneous marine environments and potentially also to the effects of climate change, which is however endangered with shrinking population sizes and hence diversity.",

    "abstract": "The proteasome controls levels of most cellular proteins, and its activity is regulated under stress, quiescence, and inflammation. However, factors determining the proteasomal degradation activity remain poorly understood. Proteasome substrates are conjugated with small proteins (tags) like ubiquitin and Fat10 to target them to the proteasome. It is unclear if the structural plasticity of proteasome-targeting tags influences substrate degradation. The tag Fat10 is activated during inflammation, and ambiguously, Fat10 and its substrates undergo rapid proteasomal degradation. We report that the rapid degradation of Fat10 substrates depends on its structural plasticity. While the ubiquitin tag is recycled at the proteasome, Fat10 is degraded with the substrate, and the mechanical unfolding kinetics of Fat10 regulates substrate degradation. Our studies reveal that long-range salt bridges are absent in the Fat10 structure, creating a plastic protein with partially unstructured regions suitable for proteasome engagement. Such a malleable structure also provides low resistance to mechanical unfolding and expedites proteasomal degradation. We also uncovered that the Fat10 plasticity destabilizes substrates significantly and creates partially unstructured regions in the substrate to enhance degradation. NMR-relaxation-derived order parameters and temperature dependence of chemical shifts identify the Fat10-induced partially unstructured regions in the substrate. They correlated excellently to the regions where Fat10 contacts the substrate, suggesting that the tag-substrate collision destabilizes the substrate. These results highlight a strong dependence of proteasomal degradation on the structural plasticity and thermodynamic properties of the proteasome-targeting tag.",

    "abstract": "The search for efficient capillary pumping has led to two main directions for investigation: first, assembly of capillary channels to provide high capillary pressures, and second, imbibition in absorbing fibers or paper pads. In the case of open microfluidics (i.e., channels where the top boundary of the fluid is in contact with air instead of a solid wall), the coupling between capillary channels and paper pads unites the two approaches and provides enhanced capillary pumping. In this work, we investigate the coupling of capillary trees-- networks of channels mimicking the branches of a tree--with paper pads placed at the extremities of the channels, mimicking the small capillary networks of leaves. It is shown that high velocities and flow rates (7 mm/s or 13.1 {micro}L/s) for more than 30 seconds using 50% (v/v) isopropyl alcohol, which has a 3-fold increase in viscosity in comparison to water; 6.5 mm/s or 12.1 {micro}L/s for more than 55 seconds with pentanol, which has an 3.75-fold increase in viscosity in comparison to water; >3.5 mm/s or 6.5 {micro}L/s for more than 150 seconds with nonanol, which has an 11-fold increase in viscosity in comparison to water) can be reached in the root channel, enabling higher sustained flow rates than that of capillary trees alone.",

    "abstract": "Although much is known about the responses of model plants to microbial features, we still lack an understanding of the extent of variation in immune perception across members of a plant family. In this work, we analyzed immune responses in Citrus and wild relatives, surveying 86 Rutaceae genotypes with differing leaf morphologies and disease resistances. We found that responses to microbial features vary both within and between members. Species in two subtribes, the Balsamocitrinae and Clauseninae, can recognize all tested microbial features (flg22, csp22, chitin), including one from Candidatus Liberibacter species (csp22CLas), the bacterium associated with citrus greening disease aka Huanglongbing. We investigated differences at the receptor level for flagellin perception (FLS2 receptor) and chitin perception (LYK5 receptor) in citrus genotypes. We were able to characterize two genetically linked FLS2 homologs from  Frost Lisbon lemon (responsive) and  Washington navel orange (non-responsive). Surprisingly, FLS2 homologs from responding and non-responding genotypes were expressed in citrus and functional when transferred to a heterologous system.  Washington navel orange weakly responds to chitin, but  Tango mandarin exhibits a robust response. LYK5 alleles were identical or nearly-identical between the two genotypes and able to complement the Arabidopsis lyk4/lyk5-2 mutant with respect to chitin perception. Collectively, our data indicates that differences in chitin and flg22 perception in these citrus genotypes are not the result of sequence polymorphisms at the receptor level. These findings shed light onto the diversity of perception of microbial features and highlight genotypes capable of recognizing polymorphic pathogen features.",
