    "abstract": "COVID-19 is a respiratory disease affecting multiple organs including the central nervous system (CNS), with a characteristic loss of smell and taste. Although frequently reported, the neurological symptoms remain enigmatic. There is no consensus on the extent of CNS infection. Here, we derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) into neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and cortical excitatory neurons to study their permissiveness to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Flow cytometry and western blot analysis indicated that NPCs and neurons do not express detectable levels of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2. We thus generated cells expressing ACE2 by lentiviral transduction to analyze in a controlled manner the properties of SARS-CoV-2 infection relative to ACE2 expression. Sensitivity of parental and ACE2 expressing cells was assessed with GFP- or luciferase-carrying pseudoviruses and with authentic SARS-CoV-2 Wuhan, D614G, Alpha or Delta variants. SARS-CoV-2 replication was assessed by microscopy, RT-qPCR and infectivity assays. Pseudoviruses infected only cells overexpressing ACE2. Neurons and NPCs were unable to efficiently replicate SARS-CoV-2, whereas ACE2 overexpressing neurons were highly sensitive to productive infection. Altogether, our results indicate that primary NPCs and cortical neurons remain poorly permissive to SARS-CoV-2 across the variants spectrum, in the absence of ACE2 expression.",

    "abstract": "Since the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we have witnessed a revolution in vaccine development with the rapid emergence and deployment of both traditional and novel vaccine platforms. The inactivated CoronaVac vaccine and the mRNA-based Pfizer/BNT162b2 vaccine are among the most widely distributed vaccines, both demonstrating high, albeit variable, vaccine effectiveness against severe COVID-19 over time. Beyond the ability of the vaccines to generate neutralizing antibodies, antibodies can attenuate disease via their ability to recruit the cytotoxic and opsinophagocytic functions of the immune response. However, whether Fc-effector functions are induced differentially, wane with different kinetics, and are boostable, remains unknown. Here, using systems serology, we profiled the Fc-effector profiles induced by the CoronaVac and BNT162b2 vaccines, over time. Despite the significantly higher antibody functional responses induced by the BNT162b2 vaccine, CoronaVac responses waned more slowly, albeit still found at levels below those present in the systemic circulation of BNT162b2 immunized individuals. However, mRNA boosting of the CoronaVac vaccine responses resulted in the induction of significantly higher peak antibody functional responses with increased humoral breadth, including to Omicron. Collectively, the data presented here point to striking differences in vaccine platform-induced functional humoral immune responses, that wane with different kinetics, and can be functionally rescued and expanded with boosting.",

    "abstract": "Genome sequences from 47 monkeypox virus infections detected in a German university virology laboratory were analyzed in context of other sequences from the 2022 outbreak and earlier monkeypox genomes. Identical non-synonymous amino acid changes in six genes and the signature of APOBEC editing match other sequences from the European outbreak. Non-synonymous changes that were present in one to three sequences were found in 34 other genes. In sequences from two lesions of one patient, an 856 nucleotide translocation between genome termini resulted in the duplication of an initial 5 gene, and the disruption or complete deletion of four genes near the 3 genome end. Orthopoxvirus genome rearrangements of this nature are known to confer fitness advantages in the face of selection pressure. This change may therefore represent an early virus adaptation in the novel widespread and sustained human-to-human context of the current monkeypox outbreak.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere has been much speculation that polyene macrolide antibiotics, such as amphotericin B (AmB) and Nystatin (NYS) may have antiviral activity against several viruses including SARS-CoV-2.\n\nObjectiveThe objective of this short communication was to determine the antiviral activity of two polyene macrolides, AmB and NYS, following treatment in kidney cells infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nMethodsA serial dilution of AmB, NYS, and irbesartan (a drug known to bind to the ACE-2 receptor as a positive control) were then added (n=4 at each concentration) to the infected Vero76 kidney cells in 100 {micro}L media. Cells were also examined for contamination at 24 hours, and for cytopathic effect (CPE) and cytotoxicity (if noticeable) under a microscope at 48 hours. In a second study, AmB and Remdesivir were incubated in kidney cells infected with the virus and inhibition of the virus was determined by an immunoassay.\n\nResults and ConclusionsAmphotericin B (AmB) showed a significant reduction in the TCID50 titer, with the 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 1.24 {micro}M, which was 2.5 times lower than the cytotoxicity concentration. NYS and Irbesartan both exhibited substantially less active and would not be considered a suitable choice for further investigations. In addition, when measuring viral inhibition by immunoassay, AmB was significantly more potent than remdesivir (EC50 31.8 nM vs. 1.15 {micro}M). Taken together, these preliminary findings suggest that AmB may have significant activity against SARS-CoV-2. However, further cell and animal studies are warranted.",

Artemisia annua L. extracts have shown potency against all previously tested variants. Here we further queried extract efficacy against omicron and its recent subvariants. Using Vero E6 cells, we measured the in vitro efficacy (IC50) of stored (frozen) dried-leaf hot-water A. annua L. extracts of four cultivars (A3, BUR, MED, and SAM) against SARS-CoV-2 variants: original WA1 (WT), BA.1.1.529+R346K (omicron), BA.2, BA.2.12.1, and BA.4. IC50 values normalized to the extract artemisinin (ART) content ranged from 0.5-16.5 {micro}M ART. When normalized to dry mass of the extracted A. annua leaves, values ranged from 20-106 {micro}g. Although IC50 values for these new variants are slightly higher than those reported for previously tested variants, they were within limits of assay variation. There was no measurable loss of cell viability at leaf dry weights [&le;]50 {micro}g of any cultivar extract. Results continue to indicate that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts (tea infusions) could potentially provide a cost-effective approach to help stave off this pandemic virus and its rapidly evolving variants.",

    "abstract": "While the world is still managing to recover from Covid-19 pandemic, Monkeypox awaits to bring in another global outbreak as a challenge to the entire mankind. However, Covid-19 pandemic have taught us lessons to move fast in viral genomic research to implement prevention and treatment strategies. One of the important aspects in Monkeypox virus should be immediately taken up is to gather insights of its evolutionary lineage based on the genomic studies. We have thus analysed the genome sequences of reported isolates of Monkeypox in the present study through phylogenomics. Host-pathogen interactions, mutation prevalence and evolutionary dynamics of this virus were investigated for all the documented isolates. Phylogenetic exploration revealed the clustering of strain Israel 2018 (MN 648051.1) from Clade I with the four isolates reported from the recent outbreak. An in-depth scrutiny of the host-pathogen interactome identified protein E3, serine protease inhibitor-2 (SPI-2), protein K7, and cytokine response-modifying protein B (CrmB) as the major regulatory hubs. Among these, the CrmB protein (dN/dS {approx} 1.61) was detected to be operating through positive selection. It possibly attests a selective advantage with the monkeypox virus in protecting the infected cells from antiviral responses elicited by the host. Studies also revealed that CrmB protein exhibited several mutations, the majority of which were destabilizing ({Delta}{Delta}G >0). While this study identified a large number of mutations within the newly outbreak clade, it also reflected that we need to move fast with the genomic analysis of the newly detected strains from around the world to develop better prevention and treatment methods",

When mice with {beta} cell-specific deletion of STIM1 (STIM1{Delta}{beta}) were challenged with high-fat diet, {beta} cell dysfunction was observed in female, but not male, mice. Impaired glucose tolerance was accompanied by reductions in {beta} cell mass, a concomitant increase in  cell mass, and significant reductions in the expression of markers of {beta} cell maturity, including MafA and UCN3. Mechanistic assays demonstrated that the sexually dimorphic phenotype observed in STIM1{Delta}{beta} mice was due in part to loss of signaling through the noncanonical 17-{beta} estradiol receptor, GPER1. Together, these data suggest that STIM1 orchestrates pancreatic {beta} cell function and identity through GPER1-mediated estradiol signaling.",

    "abstract": "Primary aldosteronism (PA) is the most common form of endocrine hypertension and effects one in 50 adults. PA is characterized by inappropriately elevated aldosterone production via renin-independent mechanisms. Driver somatic mutations for aldosterone excess have been found in approximately 90% of aldosterone-producing adenomas (APAs). Using next-generation sequencing, we identified recurrent in-frame deletions in SLC30A1 in five APAs (p.L51_A57del, n=3; p.L49_L55del, n=2). SLC30A1 encodes the ubiquitous zinc efflux transporter ZnT1 (zinc transporter 1). The identified SLC30A1 variants are situated in close proximity of the zincbinding site (H43 and D47) in transmembrane domain II and likely cause abnormal ion transport. PA cases with the unique SLC30A1 mutations showed male dominance and demonstrated increased aldosterone and 18-oxo-cortisol concentrations. Functional studies of the mutant SLC30A151_57del variant in a doxycycline-inducible adrenal cell system revealed abnormal Na+ conductivity caused by the mutant, which in turn led to the depolarization of the resting membrane potential, and thus to the opening of voltage-gated calcium channels. This resulted in an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ activity, which stimulated CYP11B2 mRNA expression and aldosterone production. Collectively, these data implicate the first-in-field zinc transporter mutations as a dominant driver of aldosterone excess in PA.",

    "abstract": "Polypeptides that activate the parathyroid hormone receptor-1 (PTHR1) are important in human physiology and medicine. Most previous studies of peptide binding to this receptor have involved displacement of a radiolabeled ligand. We report a new assay format based on bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET). Fusion of a nanoluciferase (nLuc) unit to the N-terminus of the PTHR1 allows direct detection of binding by an agonist peptide bearing a tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) unit. Affinity measurements from the BRET assay align well with results previously obtained via radioligand displacement. The BRET assay offers substantial operational benefits relative to affinity measurements involving radioactive compounds. The convenience of the new assay allowed us to explore several questions raised by earlier reports. For example, we show that although the first two residues of PTH(1-34) (the drug teriparatide) are critical for PTHR1 activation, these two residues contribute little or nothing to affinity. Comparisons among the well-studied agonists PTH(1-34), PTHrP(1-34) and \"long-acting PTH\" (LA-PTH) reveal that the high affinity of LA-PTH arises largely from a diminished rate constant for dissociation relative to the other two.",

    "abstract": "The utility of halogenation in protein design is investigated by a combination of quantitative atomistic simulations and experiment. The approach is applied to insulin, a small, therapeutically relevant domain amenable to simulation and semi-synthesis. In a singly halogenated aromatic ring, the simulations predicted regiospecific inductive effects to modulate multiple surrounding electrostatic (weakly polar) interactions, thereby amplifying changes in thermodynamic stability. In accordance with the simulations, stabilization of insulin is demonstrated by single halogen atoms at the ortho position of an invariant phenylalanine (2-F-PheB24, 2-Cl-PheB24 and 2-Br-PheB24; {Delta}{Delta}Gu = -0.5 to -1.0 kcal/mol) located at the edge of a protein crevice. Corresponding meta and para substitutions have negligible effects. The ortho-modified insulin analogs exhibit enhanced resistance to fibrillation above room temperature and retain biological activity in mammalian cells and in a rat model of diabetes mellitus. Consequently, halogen-based stabilization of insulin and other therapeutic proteins may provide a biophysical strategy to circumvent the requirement for a distribution \"cold chain\" in the developing world and enhance the shelf life of pharmaceutical formulations.",

    "abstract": "Lipids play crucial roles in many biological processes under physiological and pathological conditions. Mapping spatial distribution and examining metabolic dynamics of different lipids in cells and tissues in situ are critical for understanding aging and diseases. Commonly used imaging methods, including mass spectrometry-based technologies or labeled imaging techniques, tend to disrupt the native environment of cells/tissues and have limited spatial or spectral resolution, while traditional optical imaging techniques still lack the capacity to distinguish chemical differences between lipid subtypes. To overcome these limitations, we developed a new hyperspectral imaging platform that integrates a Penalized Reference Matching algorithm with Stimulated Raman Scattering (PRM-SRS) microscopy. With this new approach, we directly visualized and identified multiple lipid species in cells and tissues in situ with high chemical specificity and subcellular resolution. High density lipoprotein (HDL) particles containing non-esterified cholesterol was observed in the kidney, indicating that these pools of cholesterol are ectopic deposits, or have yet to be enriched. We detected a higher Cholesterol to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) ratio inside the granule cells of hippocampal samples in old mice, suggesting altered membrane lipid synthesis and metabolism in aging brains. PRM-SRS imaging also revealed subcellular distributions of sphingosine and cardiolipin in the human brain sample. Compared with other techniques, PRM-SRS demonstrates unique advantages, including faster data processing and direct user-defined visualization with enhanced chemical specificity for distinguishing clinically relevant lipid subtypes in different organs and species. Our method has broad applications in multiplexed cell and tissue imaging.",

    "abstract": "In a succession of journal papers published over 65 years ago, Sir Alan Lloyd Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Fielding Huxley discovered what now forms our contemporary understanding of excitation in nerve, and how axons conduct the action potential. Hodgkin and Huxley demonstrated that the nerve action potential is the result of a depolarizing event across a cell membrane. In an elegant theoretical framework, they established that when this depolarization event is complete, an abrupt increase in voltage gets produced that propagates longitudinally along the axon, accompanied by changes in axial conductance. Notwithstanding the elegance of Hodgkin and Huxleys incisive and explicative series of discoveries, their model is relatively complex, relies on no small number of stochastic factors, and has no analytical solution; solving for the membrane action potential and the ionic currents requires integrations approximated using numerical methods. In this paper, we present a closed-form adaptation of the Hodgkin-Huxley membrane voltage potential. The basis of our model is rooted in core conductor theory and the cable properties of neurons, with fitting parameters adapted to the classical Hodgkin-Huxley model of excitation in nerve. From this model we synthesize a novel analog circuit that simulates the dynamics of a single action potential bioelectrically equivalent to the classical Hodgkin-Huxley membrane potential. The primary novelty of our model is that it offers a bioconductive, thermodynamic, and electromagnetic explanation of how an action potential propagates in nerve in a single mathematical construct. This is in contrast to the traditional Hodgkin-Huxley equations of ionic hypothesis, which are not analytically compliant. Computational results of our model are supported by well-established quantitative descriptions of Hodgkin-Huxleys voltage response in the membrane of an axon. Our findings provide a mechanistic understanding of how intracellular conductance, the thermodynamics of magnetization, and current modulation function together to generate excitation in nerve in a unified closed-form description. In the same manner with Hodgkin-Huxleys findings, the model presented here corroborates (1) that the action potential is the result of a depolarizing event across a cell membrane; (2) that a complete depolarization event is followed by an abrupt increase in voltage that propagates longitudinally along the axon; (3) that the latter is accompanied by a considerable increase in membrane conductance. The work presented in this paper provides compelling evidence that three basic factors contribute to the propagated signaling in the membrane of an axon in a single, closed-form model. From our model, we synthesize a novel analog conductance-level circuit that simulates the dynamics of a single action potential bioelectrically equivalent to the classical Hodgkin-Huxley membrane potential. Its anticipated this work will compel those in biophysics, physical biology, and in the computational neurosciences to probe deeper into the classical and quantum features of membrane magnetization and signaling. Furthermore, its hoped that subsequent investigations of this sort will be advanced by the computational features of this model without having to resort to numerical methods of analysis.\n\nAttributionA portion of this work is reprinted from R.F.

    "abstract": "We report on an interferometric MINFLUX microscope that records protein movements with down to 1.7 nm precision within less than 1 ms. While such spatio-temporal resolution has so far required linking a strongly scattering 30-500 nm diameter bead to the much smaller protein, MINFLUX localization requires the detection of only down to 20 photons from an ~1-nm sized fluorophore. Harnessing this resolution, we dissect the unhindered stepping of the motor protein kinesin-1 on microtubules at up to physiological ATP concentrations. By attaching the fluorophore to different kinesin-1 sites and resolving steps and substeps of these protein constructs, we uncover a three-dimensional orientation change of the unbound kinesin head. We also find that kinesin-1 takes up ATP while only one head is bound, whereas hydrolysis of ATP occurs with both heads bound to the microtubule, resolving a long-standing conundrum of its mechanochemical cycle. Our results establish MINFLUX as a non-invasive tool for tracking protein movements and probing submillisecond structural rearrangements with nanometer resolution.",

    "abstract": "The active X chromosome in mammals is upregulated to balance its dosage to autosomes during evolution. However, it is elusive why the currently known dosage compensation machinery showed uneven and small influence on X genes, necessitating systemic investigation of X dosage in different angles and identification of new dosage regulators. Here, based on >20,000 transcriptomes, we identified two X gene groups (genome ploidy-sensitive [PSX] and ploidy-insensitive [PIX] genes), showing distinct but evolutionarily-conserved (in both primates and mouse) dosage compensations (termed X-over-Autosome dosage Ratio, or XAR). We then explored XAR in diseases and in stem cells, where XAR is potentially important. We demonstrated that XAR-PIX was downregulated while XAR-PSX upregulated across cancer types at both RNA and protein levels. In contrast, XAR-PIX was upregulated while XAR-PSX downregulated during stem cell differentiation. Interestingly, XAR-PIX, but not XAR-PSX, was significantly lower and associated with autoantibodies and inflammation in lupus patients, suggesting that insufficient dosage of PIX genes may contribute to lupus pathogenesis. We further identified and experimentally validated two new XAR regulators, TP53 and ATRX. Collectively, we provided insights to further unravel the mystery of X dosage compensation in mammals and its pathophysiological roles in human diseases.",

    "abstract": "Sorghum is one of the most important crops providing food and feed in many of the worlds harsher environments. Sorghum utilises the C4 pathway of photosynthesis in which a biochemical carbon concentrating mechanism results in high CO2 assimilation rates. Overexpressing the Rieske subunit of the Cytochrome b6f complex was previously shown to increase the rate of photosynthetic electron transport and stimulate CO2 assimilation in the model C4 plant Setaria viridis. To test whether productivity of C4 crops could be improved by Rieske overexpression, we created transgenic Sorghum bicolor plants with increased Rieske content. The transgenic plants showed no marked changes in abundance of other photosynthetic proteins or chlorophyll content. Increases in yield of Photosystem II and CO2 assimilation rate as well as faster responses of non-photochemical quenching during transient photosynthetic responses were observed as a result of an elevated in vivo Cytochrome b6f activity in plants overexpressing Rieske. The steady-state rates of electron transport and CO2 assimilation did not differ between transgenic and control plants, suggesting that Cytochrome b6f is not the only factor limiting electron transport in sorghum at high light and high CO2. Nevertheless, more agile responses of photosynthesis to light transitions led to increases in biomass and grain yield in plants overexpressing Rieske. Our results indicate that increasing Rieske content could boost productivity of C4 crops by improving the efficiency of light utilisation and conversion to biomass.",

    "abstract": "A triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) model using the murine 4T1 tumor cell line was used to explore the efficacy of an adjuvanted survivin (SVN)-peptide microparticle vaccine using tumor growth as the outcome metric. We first performed tumor cell dose titration studies to determine a tumor cell dose that resulted in sufficient tumor takes but minimal morbidity/mortality within the required study period. Later, in a second cohort of mice, the SVN-peptide microparticle vaccine was administered via intraperitoneal injection at study start with a second dose given 14 days later. An orthotopic injection of 4T1 cells into the mammary tissue was performed on the same day as the administration of the second vaccine dose. The mice were followed for up to 41 days with subcutaneous measurements of tumor volume made every 3-4 days. Vaccination with SVN peptides was associated with a peptide antigen-specific {gamma}IFN Elispot response in the murine splenocyte population but was absent from the control microparticle group. At end of study, we found that vaccination with adjuvanted SVN-peptide microparticles resulted in statistically significant slower primary tumor growth rates in BALB/c mice challenged with 4T1 cells relative to the control peptide-less vaccination group. These studies suggest that T-cell immunotherapy specifically targeting survivin might be an applicable neoadjuvant immunotherapy therapy for TNBC. More pre-clinical studies and clinical trials will be needed to explore this concept further.",

    "abstract": "Development of direct acting macrofilaricides for the treatment of human filariases is hampered by limitations in screening throughput imposed by the parasite life cycle. Efforts to circumvent arduous screening of adult filariae include drug repurposing and high-throughput screens that target commensal bacteria. In vitro adult screens typically assess single phenotypes without prior enrichment for chemicals with antifilarial potential. We developed a multivariate screen that identified dozens of compounds with submicromolar macrofilaricidal activity, achieving a hit rate of >50% by leveraging abundantly accessible microfilariae. Adult assays were multiplexed to thoroughly characterize compound activity across relevant parasite fitness traits, including neuromuscular control, fecundity, metabolism, and viability. 17 compounds from a diverse chemogenomic library elicited strong effects on at least one adult trait, with differential potency against microfilariae and adults. Stage-specific drug effects may be crucial to limiting adverse events in endemic regions, and our screen identified five compounds with high potency against adults but low potency or slow-acting microfilaricidal effects, at least one of which acts through a novel mechanism. We show that the use of microfilariae in a primary screen outperforms model nematode developmental assays and virtual screening of protein structures inferred with deep-learning. These data provide new leads for drug development, and the high-content and multiplex assays set a new foundation for antifilarial discovery.",

In most mammals, uric acid elimination is facilitated by the enzyme uricase. However, human uricase is a pseudogene, having been inactivated early in hominid evolution. Though it has long been known that uric acid is eliminated in the gut, the role of the gut microbiota in hyperuricemia has not been studied. Here we identify a widely distributed bacterial gene cluster that encodes a pathway for uric acid degradation. Stable isotope tracing demonstrates that gut bacteria metabolize uric acid to xanthine or short chain fatty acids. Ablation of the microbiota in uricase-deficient mice causes severe hyperuricemia, and anaerobe-targeted antibiotics increase the risk of gout in humans. These data reveal a role for the gut microbiota in uric acid excretion and highlight the potential for microbiome-targeted therapeutics in hyperuricemia.",

In this study, we measured optical light attenuation factors; absorption, scattering, and reflection of skim milk (SM) and considered for evaluation of delivered UV dose under stirred conditions. The accuracy of the method followed for the estimation of delivered UV dose in SM was verified by comparative studies of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 inactivation in phosphate buffer (transparent fluid), and humic acid (opaque fluid). Absorption, scattering coefficient, and the reflectance of SM at 254 nm was measured as 19 {+/-} 0.3/cm. 26 {+/-} 0.5/cm and 10.6 %, respectively. SM inoculated with C. burnetii was irradiated using a collimated beam device equipped with a low-pressure UV-C254 nm lamp at doses from 0 - 12 mJ{middle dot}cm-2. Results showed a log-linear inactivation of C. burnetii in SM with UV-C sensitivity (D10) value of 4.1 {+/-} 0.04 mJ{middle dot}cm-2.

    "abstract": "The gut microbiome is complex, raising questions about the role of individual strains in the community. Here, we address this question by focusing on a functional unit within the community, the metabolic niche that controls bile acid 7-dehydroxylation. By constructing variants of a complex defined community in which we drop out strains that occupy this niche, we explore how interactions within and between niches shape community-level metabolism. Omitting both members of the niche, Clostridium scindens (Cs) and Clostridium hylemonae (Ch), eliminates secondary bile acid production and reshapes the community in a highly specific manner: eight strains go up or down in relative abundance by >100-fold, while the remaining strains are largely unaffected. In single-strain dropout communities (i.e., a strain swap within the niche), Cs and Ch reach the same relative abundance and dehydroxylate bile acids to a similar extent. However, the effect on strains in other niches differs markedly: Clostridium sporogenes increases >1000-fold in the {Delta}Cs but not {Delta}Ch dropout, reshaping the pool of microbiome-derived phenylalanine metabolites. Thus, strains that are functionally redundant within a niche can have widely varying impacts outside the niche, and a strain swap can ripple through the community in an unpredictable manner, resulting in a large impact on an unrelated community-level phenotype. Mice colonized by the {Delta}Cs{Delta}Ch community show decreased liver steatosis relative to those colonized by the {Delta}Ch community, demonstrating that a single strain from the microbiome can have a substantive impact on host physiology. Our work opens the door to the mechanistic studies of the role of an individual strain on community ecology and host physiology.",

    "abstract": "Glutamine synthetase is the key enzyme of nitrogen assimilation, which is encoded in the first cistron of glnALG operon and is induced under nitrogen limiting conditions through transcriptional activation by NtrBC in Salmonella and E. coli. 2-oxoglutarate serves as the carbon skeleton of glutamate and glutamine, but how 2-oxoglutarate fluctuation is controlled in response to nitrogen availability remained unknown. We show that the glnA mRNA produces an Hfq-dependent GlnZ sRNA from its 3 sUTR through RNase E-mediated cleavage. Through a base-pairing mechanism, GlnZ primarily regulates sucA, encoding the E1o component of 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase. In the cells grown on glutamine as the nitrogen source, the endogenous GlnZ represses the expression of SucA to redirect the carbon flow from the TCA cycle to the nitrogen assimilation pathway. This study also clarifies that the release of GlnZ sRNA from the glnA mRNA by RNase E is essential for the post-transcriptional regulation of sucA, and thus the mRNA coordinates the two independent functions to balance the supply and demand of the fundamental metabolites.",

Nuclear HCAR1 (N-HCAR1) directly interacts with chromatin/DNA promoting expression of genes involved in cellular migration. Notably, we show N-HCAR1 particularly regulates a broader transcriptomic signature than its PM counterpart, emphasizing on the facts that functional output of N-HCAR1 is larger than PM localized HCAR1. Our study presents several unprecedented processes by which a GPCR through location-biased activity regulate various cellular functions and how cancer cells exploit these.",

    "abstract": "Communication between myriad cell types during organ formation underlies proper morphogenesis1. In cardiac development, reciprocal signaling between mesoderm progenitors and neural crest cells is essential, and its disruption leads to congenital heart malformations, the most common human birth defect. However, mechanistic interrogation of temporal gene networks and cis regulatory elements in this crosstalk is limited2,3. Here, we integrated single cell chromatin accessibility and transcriptomics to establish an unbiased and temporal epigenomic map of the embryonic mouse heart over multiple stages and developed machine learning models to predict enhancers for heart and neural crest. We leveraged these advances to determine the consequences of dysregulated signaling at single cell resolution caused by deletion of TBX1, a transcription factor that causes morphogenetic defects of the cardiac outflow tract in humans and functions non-cell autonomously in cardiac mesodermal progenitors to direct pharyngeal neural crest differentiation4-6. Loss of Tbx1 in mice led to broad closure of chromatin regions enriched in cardiac progenitor transcription factor motifs within a narrow subset of cardiac mesodermal progenitors and correlated with diminished expression of numerous members of the fibroblast growth factor, retinoic acid, Notch and Semaphorin pathways. In affected progenitors, ectopic accessibility and expression of posterior heart field factors in the anterior heart field suggested impaired axial patterning. In response, a subset of cardiac neural crest cells displayed epigenomic and transcriptional defects, indicating a failure of differentiation corresponding to dysregulation of the anterior-posterior gradient of pharyngeal Hox gene expression. This study demonstrates that single-cell genomics and machine learning can generate a mechanistic model for how disruptions in cell communication selectively affect spatiotemporally dynamic regulatory networks in cardiogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Birth defects occur in [~]6% of all live births and can be caused by combinations of genetic and environmental influences1. Large-scale DNA sequencing efforts are revealing genetic influences2,3, but investigations into the contributions of environmental factors have largely been limited to association studies with limited mechanistic insight. Hyperglycemia present in pre-gestational diabetic mothers is among the most frequent environmental contributor to congenital defects and results in an increased incidence of congenital heart defects and craniofacial anomalies4. However, the cell types involved and underlying mechanisms by which maternal hyperglycemia affects these regions are unknown. Here, we utilized multi-modal single cell analyses to reveal that maternal diabetes affects the epigenomic and transcriptomic state of specific subsets of cardiac and craniofacial progenitors during embryogenesis. A previously unrecognized subpopulation of anterior heart field progenitors expressing Alx3 acquired a more posterior identity in response to maternal hyperglycemia, based on gene expression and chromatin status. Similarly, a sub-population of neural crest-derived cells in the second pharyngeal arch, which contributes to craniofacial structures, also displayed abnormalities in cell specification and patterning. Analysis of differentially accessible chromatin regions demonstrated that disrupted patterning was associated with increased intrinsic retinoic acid signaling in affected cell types in response to maternal diabetes and hyperglycemia. This work demonstrates how an environmental insult can have highly selective epigenomic consequences on discrete cell types leading to developmental patterning defects.",

    "abstract": "Immune responses are energetically costly to produce and often trade off with investment in reproduction and offspring provisioning. We predicted that hosts can interpret the magnitude of the infection threat from cues like initial bacterial load to adjust reproductive investment into offspring quantity and quality. To test this prediction, we exposed female flour beetles (Tribolium castaneum) to naive or sterile media controls or one of three increasing doses of heat-killed Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). To estimate offspring quantity, we measured the number of eggs and hatched larvae from each maternal treatment group. To estimate offspring quality, we measured egg protein content, development to pupation, pupal weight, and offspring survival against Bt infection. Compared to naive controls, low and intermediate bacterial doses resulted in lower female fecundity, suggesting a shift to a somatic maintenance strategy. Meanwhile, in the highest-dose group, fecundity was negatively correlated with egg protein content, suggesting a trade-off between offspring quality and quantity that could mask terminal investment based on metrics of quantity alone. Our results underscore the need to account for the magnitude of environmental cue when quantifying plasticity and trade-offs among life history traits, and provide new insight into the trans-generational effects of immune responses.",

This study aimed to conduct a genome-wide methylation profiling to detect differentially methylated regions (DMRs) responsible for epigenetic differences in stem cells that displayed high and low efficiency of SCNT and to elucidate the low efficiency of cloning rate in pigs. Adipose tissue mesenchymal stem cells (AMSC)s lines were isolated from adipose tissue of adult male pigs (n=20; high-efficiency cells=10; low efficiency cells= 10). Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) was performed on an Illumina HiSeq1500. Paired-end reads were filtered to remove the adapter contamination, and low-quality reads using TrimGalore!. Filtered reads were mapped to the reference genome using Bismark. MethylKit was used to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (bases and tiles), showing statistically significant differential methylation between two groups: high and low-efficiency AMSCs. Hierarchical cluster analysis according to methylation patterns clearly defined groups with low and high cloning efficiency. We report 3704 bases with statistically significant differences in methylation and 10062 tiles with statistically significant differences in methylation. Most differentially methylated sites are intergenic 62%, 31% are intronic, 4% are located in exons and 4% in promoters. 37% of differentially methylated sites are located in known CpG islands (CGIs) and 4% in CpG island shores (CGSs).",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in single-cell technologies enable joint profiling of multiple omics. These profiles can reveal the complex interplay of different regulatory layers in single cells; still, new challenges arise when integrating datasets with some features shared across experiments and others exclusive to a single source; combining information across these sources is called mosaic integration. The difficulties lie in imputing missing molecular layers to build a self-consistent atlas, finding a common latent space, and transferring learning to new data sources robustly. Existing mosaic integration approaches based on matrix factorization cannot efficiently adapt to nonlinear embeddings for the latent cell space and are not designed for accurate imputation of missing molecular layers. By contrast, we propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model, scVAEIT, to integrate and impute multimodal datasets with mosaic measurements. A key advance is the use of a missing mask for learning the conditional distribution of unobserved modalities and features, which makes scVAEIT flexible to combine different panels of measurements from multimodal datasets accurately and in an end-to-end manner. Imputing the masked features serves as a supervised learning procedure while preventing overfitting by regularization. Focusing on gene expression, protein abundance, and chromatin accessibility, we validate that scVAEIT robustly imputes the missing modalities and features of cells biologically different from the training data. scVAEIT also adjusts for batch effects while maintaining the biological variation, which provides better latent representations for the integrated datasets. We demonstrate that scVAEIT significantly improves integration and imputation across unseen cell types, different technologies, and different tissues.\n\nSignificance StatementSingle-cell multimodal assays provide an unprecedented opportunity for investigating heterogeneity of cell types and novel associations with disease and development. Although analyses of such multimodal datasets have the potential to provide new insights that cannot be inferred with a single modality, access typically requires the integration of multiple data sources. We propose a probabilistic variational autoencoder model for mosaic integration, which involves merging data sources that include features shared across datasets and features exclusive to a single data source. Our model is designed to provide a lower dimensional representation of the cells for visualization, clustering, and other downstream tasks; accurate imputation of missing features and observations; and transfer learning for robustly imputing new datasets when only partial measurements are available.",

This revealed systematic differences between the pQTLs and eQTL, with only 35% of common genetic variants modulating both intermediate molecular phenotypes. By taking advantage of the tightly co-regulated pattern of the proteins, we also identified SNPs affecting protein network upon Candida stimulations. Colocalization of pQTLs and eQTLs signals implicated several genomic loci including MMP-1 and AMZ1. Analysis of Candida-induced single cell gene expression data implicated specific cell types that exhibit significant expression QTLs upon stimulation.

    "abstract": "Cognitive-behavioural testing in preclinical models of Alzheimers disease has typically been limited to visuo-spatial memory tests and has failed to capture the broad scope of deficits patients also display in goal-directed action control. The current study addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive investigation of how goal-directed actions are affected in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimers disease. Specifically, we tested outcome devaluation performance - a popular test of goal-directed action - in male and female human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP)-J20 mice. Mice were first trained to press a left and right lever for unique pellet and sucrose outcomes respectively (counterbalanced) over four days. On test, mice were fed one of the two outcomes to reduce its value via sensory specific satiety and subsequently given a choice between levers. Goal-directed action was intact for 36-week-old wildtype mice of both sexes, because they responded more on the lever associated with the still-valued outcome than that associated with the devalued outcome (i.e. Valued > Devalued). Goal-directed action was impaired (Valued = Devalued) for J20 mice of both sexes, and for 52-week-old male mice regardless of genotype. Following an additional 4 days of lever press training (i.e., 8 days lever pressing in total), outcome devaluation was intact for all mice regardless of age or genotype. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that increased microglial expression in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus was associated with poorer outcome devaluation performance on initial tests, but not with tests performed after 8 days of lever pressing. Together, these data demonstrate that goal-directed action is transiently impaired in J20 mice of both sexes and in aging male mice regardless of genotype, and that this impairment is related to neuroinflammation in the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus.",

Using single-molecule tracking, coupled with machine learning, we examined the mobility of multiple transcriptional regulators. We show that H2B and ten different transcriptional regulators display two distinct low-mobility states. Our results indicate that both states represent dynamic interactions with chromatin. Ligand activation results in a dramatic increase in the proportion of steroid receptors in the lowest mobility state. Mutational analysis revealed that only chromatin interactions in the lowest mobility state require an intact DNA-binding domain as well as oligomerization domains. Importantly, these states are not spatially separated as previously believed but in fact, individual H2B and TF molecules can dynamically switch between them. Together, our results identify two unique and distinct low-mobility states of transcriptional regulators that appear to represent common pathways for transcription activation in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "Hypermethylated in Cancer 1 (HIC1) is an established tumor suppressor, which is frequently inactivated in various cancers. In colorectal carcinoma (CRC), silencing of HIC1 has been recognized as one of the important events in malignant tumor progression. Strikingly, CRC patients with high HIC1 expression have a worse prognosis than patients with relatively low HIC1 mRNA levels. To analyze the function of HIC1, we performed expression profiling of human primary fibroblasts after downregulation of HIC1 by RNA interference. We show that HIC1 deficiency triggers a p53-dependent response and that disruption of the HIC1 gene in human colon cells delays cell cycle progression under serum deficiency conditions. Moreover, treatment with etoposide, a DNA-damaging agent, significantly impairs the proliferation rate and dynamics of damaged DNA repair in HIC1-deficient compared with wild-type cells. One of the genes upregulated in HIC1-depleted cells encodes cell cycle regulator E2F7. E2F7 is an atypical member of the E2F family, which functions primarily as a transcriptional repressor, and its downregulation is essential for proper cell cycle progression and expression of genes involved in DNA repair. We demonstrated that E2F7 is indeed the target of transcriptional repression mediated by HIC1. Moreover, our results suggest that the phenotypic manifestations associated with loss of the HIC1 gene, in particular the changes in cell cycle progression and slowed repair of damaged DNA, are caused by dysregulation of E2F7 expression. Finally, we observed an inverse relationship between HIC1 and E2F7 in a panel of CRC. Importantly, CRC patients who express relatively high levels of E2F7 have a remarkably better prognosis than patients with intermediate or low levels of E2F7 expression.",
