    "abstract": "In the last decade considerable advances have been made towards the design of HIV-1 vaccines that induce neutralizing antibodies (NAbs). Despite the progress, no vaccine is able to consistently elicited broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs). Here we present a case study of a rabbit that was immunized with a subtype B native like envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer, AMC016 SOSIP.v4.2, with a dense and intact glycan shield, followed by a trivalent combination of subtype B trimers. After the priming phase serum from this animal neutralized several heterologous subtype B neutralization resistant (tier 2) viruses. Subsequent immunization with the trivalent combination of subtype B trimers further increased the breadth and potency of the NAb response. EM based polyclonal epitope mapping revealed that a cross reactive CD4 binding-site (CD4bs) antibody response, that was present after priming with the monovalent trimer and boosting with the trivalent combination, was most likely responsible for the broad neutralization. While anecdotal, this study provides proof-of-concept that native-like Env trimers are capable of inducing CD4bs-directed bNAb responses and should guide efforts to improve the consistency with which such responses are generated.",

    "abstract": "The pathological properties of airway mucus in cystic fibrosis (CF) are dictated by mucus concentration and composition, with mucins and DNA being responsible for mucus viscoelastic properties. As CF pulmonary disease progresses, the concentrations of mucins and DNA increase and are associated with increased mucus viscoelasticity and decreased transport. Similarly, the biophysical properties of bacterial biofilms are heavily influenced by the composition of their extracellular polymeric substances (EPS). While the roles of polymer concentration and composition in mucus and biofilm mechanical properties have been evaluated independently, the relationship between mucus concentration and composition and the biophysical properties of biofilms grown therein remains unknown. Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown in airway mucus as a function of overall concentration and DNA concentration to mimic healthy and CF physiology and biophysical properties were evaluated with macro- and microrheology. Biofilms were also characterized after exposure to DNase or DTT to examine the effects of DNA and mucin degradation, respectively. Identifying critical targets in biofilms for disrupting mechanical stability in highly concentrated mucus may lead to the development of efficacious biofilm therapies and ultimately improve CF patient outcomes. Overall mucus concentration was the predominant contributor to biofilm viscoelasticity and both DNA degradation and mucin reduction resulted in compromised biofilm mechanical strength.",

    "abstract": "Orthobunyaviruses have been reported to cause severe diseases in humans or animals, posing a threat to human health and social economy. Ebinur lake virus (EBIV) is a newly classified orthobunyavirus, which needs further intensive study and therapies to cope with its potential infection risk to human and animals. Here, through the reverse genetics system, the recombinant EBIV of wild type (rEBIV/WT) and NP-conjugated-eGFP (rEBIV/eGFP/S) were rescued for the application of the rapid antiviral drug screening. The eGFP fluorescence signal of the rEBIV/eGFP/S was stable in the process of successive passage in BHK-21 cells (over 10 passages) and this recombinant virus could replicate in various cell lines. Compared to the wild type EBIV, the rEBIV/eGFP/S caused the smaller plaques and its peak titers were lower, suggesting attenuation due to the eGFP insertion. Through the high-content screening (HCS) system, ribavirin showed an inhibitory effect on the rEBIV/eGFP/S with an EC50 of 21.91 M, while favipiravir did not inhibit, even at high concentrations. In addition, five of ninety-six natural compounds had antiviral against EBIV. The robust reverse genetics system for EBIV will facilitate investigation into replication and assembly mechanisms and assist drug and vaccine development.",

    "abstract": "Noise plays a major role in cellular processes and in the development of tissues and organs. Several studies have examined the origin, the integration or the accommodation of noise in gene expression, cell growth and elaboration of organ shape. By contrast, much less is known about variability in cell division plane positioning, its origin and links with cell geometry, and its impact on tissue organization. Taking advantage of the first-stereotyped-then-variable division patterns in the embryo of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we combined 3D imaging and quantitative cell shape and cell lineage analysis together with mathematical and computer modeling to perform a large scale, systematic analysis of variability in division plane orientation. Our results reveal that, paradoxically, variability in cell division patterns of Arabidopsis embryos is accompanied by a progressive reduction of cell shape heterogeneity. The paradox is solved by showing that variability operates within a reduced repertoire of possible division plane orientations that is related to cell geometry. We show that in several domains of the embryo, a recently proposed geometrical division rule recapitulates observed variable patterns, thus suggesting that variable patterns emerge from deterministic principles operating in a variable geometrical context. Our work highlights the importance of emerging patterns in the plant embryo under iterated division principles, but also reveal domains where deviations between rule predictions and experimental observations point to additional regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The  suppressed in-ovo virus infection trait (SOV) was the first trait applied in honey bee breeding programs aimed to increase resilience to virus infections, a major threat for colony survival. By screening drone eggs for viruses, the SOV trait scores the antiviral resistance of queens and its implications for vertical transmission. In this study, queens from both naturally surviving and traditionally managed colonies from across Europe were screened using a two-fold improved SOV phenotyping protocol. First, a gel-based RT-PCR was replaced by a RT-qPCR. This not only allowed quantification of the infection load but also increased the test sensitivity. Second, a genotype specific primer set was replaced by a primer set that covered all known deformed wing virus (DWV) genotypes, which resulted in higher virus loads and fewer false negative results. It was demonstrated that incidences of vertical transmission of DWV were more frequent in naturally surviving populations than in traditionally managed colonies, although the virus load in the eggs remained the same. Dynamics in vertical transmission were further emphasized when comparing virus infections with queen age. Interestingly, older queens showed significantly lower infection loads of DWV in both traditionally managed and naturally surviving colonies, as well as reduced DWV infection frequencies in traditionally managed colonies when compared with younger queens. Seasonal variation in vertical transmission was found with lower infection frequencies in spring compared to summer for DWV and black queen cell virus. Together, these patterns in vertical transmission suggest an adaptive antiviral response of queens aimed at reducing vertical transmission over time.",

    "abstract": "Changes in free-roaming dog population size are important indicators of the effectiveness of dog population management. Assessing the effectiveness of different management methods also requires estimating the processes that change population size, such as the rates of recruitment into and removal from a population. This is one of the first studies to quantify the size, rates of recruitment and removal, and health and welfare status of free-roaming dog populations in Europe. We determined the size, dynamics, and health status of free-roaming dog populations in Pescara, Italy, and Lviv, Ukraine, over a 15-month study period. Both study populations had ongoing dog population management through catch-neuter-release and sheltering programmes. Average monthly apparent survival probability was 0.93 (95% CI 0.81-1.00) in Pescara and 0.93 (95% CI 0.84-0.99) in Lviv. An average of 7 dogs km-2 were observed in Pescara and 40 dogs km-2 in Lviv. Per capita entry probabilities varied between 0.09 and 0.20 in Pescara, and 0.12 and 0.42 in Lviv. In Lviv, detection probability was lower on weekdays (odds ratio: 0.74, 95% CI 0.53-0.96) and higher on market days (odds ratio: 2.58, 95% CI 1.28-4.14), and apparent survival probability was lower in males (odds ratio: 0.25, 95% CI 0.03-0.59). Few juveniles were observed in the study populations, indicating that recruitment may be occurring by movement between dog subpopulations (e.g. from local owned or neighbouring free-roaming dog populations), with important consequences for population control. This study provides important data for planning effective dog population management and for informing population and infectious disease modelling. The results emphasise the importance of dog population management efforts that encourage responsible ownership through reduced abandonment and cover the entire city to reduce the risk of dog movement between sections of the city hindering management efforts.",

    "abstract": "Homozygosity for pathogenic variants in the leptin gene leads to congenital leptin deficiency causing early-onset extreme obesity. This monogenic form of obesity has mainly been detected in patients from consanguineous families. Prevalence estimates for the general population using the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) database reported a low frequency of leptin mutations. One in approximately 15 million individuals will be homozygous for a deleterious leptin variant. With the present study, we aimed to extend these findings utilizing the augmented Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) v2.1.1 including more than 140,000 samples. In total, 68 non-synonymous and 7 loss-of-function (LoF) leptin variants were deposited in gnomAD. By predicting functional implications with the help of in silico tools, like SIFT, PolyPhen2 and MutationTaster2021, the prevalence of hetero- and homozygosity for putatively pathological variants (n = 32; pathogenic prediction by at least two tools) in the leptin gene were calculated. Across all populations, the estimated prevalence for heterozygosity for functionally relevant variants was approximately 1:2,100 and 1:17,860,000 for homozygosity. This prevalence deviated between the individual populations. Accordingly, people from South Asia were at greater risk to carry a possibly damaging leptin variant than individuals of other ancestries. Generally, this study emphasises the scarcity of deleterious leptin variants in the general population with varying prevalence for distinct study groups.",

Almost all commercial sorghum hybrids were developed using the A1 cytoplasmic genetic male sterility system.

In a cross of male sterile line 296A with A1 cytoplasm and restorer lines comprised of a set of Recombinant Inbred Lines (RILs), the inheritance pattern of fertility restoration of sorghum was studied. The F1 hybrid was completely fertile, revealing the dominant nature of fertility restoration, which is controlled by one or two major genes with modifiers. In this study, the genetics of fertility restoration of the A1 cytoplasmic nuclear male sterility system (CGMS) in sorghum were investigated in segregating F2 and BC1 populations of A1 cytoplasm crosses. Fertility restoration was governed by a monogenic inheritance (3F:1S) mechanism represented by a single dominant gene responsible for fertility restoration in all of the crosses studied.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to analyze the effect of residual microbial nucleic acid in instruments for hip joint arthroplasty on false-positive sequencing results. Samples were taken from 3 different acetabular reamer for hip arthroplasty in 7 different hospitals. The whole process was strictly aseptic, metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) was performed according to standard operating procedures. The sterility of instruments was confirmed by culture method. The sequencing results of specimens from different hospitals were compared to analyze the difference of background bacteria. Bioinformatics analysis and visualization were presented through R language. A total of 26 samples were processed by mNGS, including 24 instrument swab samples, 1 blank swab control, and 1 blank water control. 254,314,707 reads were sequenced in all samples. The results showed that 1.13% of Clean Reads can be matched to pathogenic microorganism genomes, of which bacterial sequences account for 87.48%, fungal sequences account for 11.18%, parasite sequences account for 1.26%, and virus sequences account for 0.06%. The results of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) demonstrated that the distribution of bacteria on the surface of instruments was significantly different between medical institutions. Through the Venn diagram, it was found that 465 species of bacteria in all region hospitals, Liaocheng Peoples Hospital had a maximum of 340 species of bacteria, followed by Guanxian County Peoples Hospital with 169 species. The clustering heat map illustrated that the distribution of bacterial groups in three different instrument samples in the same hospital was basically the same, and the bacterial genera varied significantly among hospitals. The residual microbial nucleic acid fragments are mainly bacterial DNA and represent differences in different medical institutions, The establishment of independent background bacterial libraries in different medical institutions can effectively improve the accuracy of mNGS diagnosis and help to exclude background microorganisms interference.",

GPS-seq combines data from high-throughput sequencing with manifold learning to obtain the spatial transcriptomic landscape of a given tissue section without optical microscopy. In this framework, similar to technologies like Slide-seq and 10X Visium, tissue samples are stamped on a surface of randomly-distributed DNA-barcoded spots (or beads). The transcriptomic sequences of proximal cells are fused to DNA barcodes, enabling the recovery of a transcriptomic pixel image by high-throughput sequencing. The barcode spots serve as \"anchors\" which also capture spatially diffused \"satellite\" barcodes, and therefore allow computational reconstruction of spot positions without optical sequencing or depositing barcodes to pre-specified positions. In theory, it could generate 100 mm x 100 mm spatial transcriptomic images with 10-20 m resolution by localizing 108 DNA-barcoded pixels with a single Illumina NovaSeq run. The general framework of GPS-seq is also compatible with standard single-cell (or single-nucleus) capture methods, and any modality of single-cell genomics, such as sci-ATAC-seq, could be transformed into spatial genomics in this strategy. We envision that GPS-seq will lead to breakthrough discoveries in diverse areas of biology by enabling organ-scale imaging of multiple genomic statuses at single-cell resolution for the first time.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing the evolution, diversity, and paleobiogeography of North Americas Late Cretaceous dinosaur assemblages requires spatiotemporally contiguous data; however, there remains a spatial and temporal disparity in dinosaur data on the continent. The rarity of vertebrate-bearing sedimentary deposits representing Turonian-Santonian ecosystems, and the relatively sparse record of dinosaurs from the eastern portion of the continent, present persistent challenges for studies of North American dinosaur evolution. Here we describe an assemblage of ornithomimosaurian materials from the Santonian Eutaw Formation of Mississippi. Morphological data coupled with osteohistological growth markers suggest the presence of two taxa of different body sizes, including one of the largest ornithomimosaurians known worldwide. The regression predicts a femoral circumference and a body mass of the Eutaw individuals similar to or greater than that of large-bodied ornithomimosaurs, Beishanlong grandis and Gallimimus bullatus. The paleohistology of MMNS VP-6332 demonstrates that the individual was at least 11 years of age (similar to B. grandis [[~]375 kg, 13-14 years old at death]). Additional pedal elements share some intriguing features with ornithomimosaurs yet suggest a larger-body size closer to Deinocheirus mirificus. The presence of a large-bodied ornithomimosaur in this region during this time is consistent with the relatively recent discoveries of early-diverging, large-bodied ornithomimosaurs from mid-Cretaceous strata of Laurasia (Arkansaurus fridayi and B. grandis). The smaller Eutaw taxon is represented by a tibia preserving seven growth cycles, with osteohistological indicators of decreasing growth, yet belongs to an individual with near reaching somatic maturity of the larger taxon, suggesting the co-existence of medium- and large-bodied ornithomimosaur taxa during the Late Cretaceous Santonian of North America. The Eutaw ornithomimosaur materials provide key information on the diversity and distribution of North American ornithomimosaurs and Appalachian dinosaurs and fit with broader evidence of multiple cohabiting species of ornithomimosaurian dinosaurs in Late Cretaceous ecosystems of Laurasia.",

However, the role of music on plants, especially on signal response, has been usually neglected in research. Herein, we investigated the growth state, gene expression, and signal response in duckweed treated with soft music. The protein content in duckweed after music treatment for 7 days was about 1.6 times that in duckweed without music treatment. Additionally, Fv/Fm in duckweed treated with music was 0.78, which was significantly higher in comparison with the control group (P < 0.01). Interestingly, music promoted the Glu and Ca signaling response. To further explore the global molecular mechanism, we performed transcriptome analysis. A total of 1296 DEGs were found for all these investigated genes in duckweed treated with music compared to the control group. Among these, up-regulation of the expression of metabolism-related genes related to glycolysis, cell wall biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, and pentose phosphate pathways were found. Overall, these results provided a molecular basis to music-triggered signal response, transcriptomic, and growth changes in duckweed, which also highlighted the potential of music as an environmentally friendly stimulus to promote improved protein production in duckweed.",

    "abstract": "Spike timing-dependent plasticity, related to differential Hebb-rules, has become a leading paradigm in neuronal learning, because weights can grow or shrink depending on the timing of pre- and post-synaptic signals. Here we use this paradigm to reduce unwanted (acoustic) noise. Our system relies on heterosynaptic differential Hebbian learning and we show that it can efficiently eliminate noise by up to -140 dB in multi-microphone setups under various conditions. The system quickly learns, most often within a few seconds, and it is robust with respect to different geometrical microphone configurations, too. Hence, this theoretical study demonstrates that it is possible to successfully transfer differential Hebbian learning, derived from the neurosciences, into a technical domain.",

    "abstract": "Open source analytical software for the analysis of electrophysiological cardiomyocyte data offers a variety of new functionalities to complement closed-source, proprietary tools. Here, we present the Cardio PyMEA application, a free, modifiable, and open source program for the analysis of microelectrode array (MEA) data obtained from cardiomyocyte cultures. Cardio PyMEA was written entirely in Python 3 to provide an accessible, integrated workflow that possesses a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) written in PyQt5 to allow for performant, cross-platform utilization. This application makes use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to facilitate the relatively straightforward incorporation of custom functionalities, e.g. power law analysis, that suit the needs of the user. Cardio PyMEA is available as an open source application under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). The source code for Cardio PyMEA can be downloaded from Github at the following repository: https://github.com/csdunhamUC/cardio_pymea.",

    "abstract": "Biological networks are important for the analysis of human diseases, which summarize the regulatory interactions and other relationships between different molecules. Understanding and constructing networks for molecules, such as DNA, RNA and proteins, can help elucidate the mechanisms of complex biological systems. The Gaussian Graphical Models (GGMs) are popular tools for the estimation of biological networks. Nonetheless, reconstructing GGMs from high-dimensional datasets is still challenging. Current methods cannot handle the sparsity and high-dimensionality issues arising from datasets very well. Here we developed a new GGM, called the GR2D2 (Graphical R2-induced Dirichlet Decomposition) model, based on the R2D2 priors for linear models. Besides, we provided a data-augmented block Gibbs sampler algorithm. The R code is available at https://github.com/RavenGan/GR2D2. The GR2D2 estimator shows superior performance in estimating the precision matrices compared to existing techniques in various simulation settings. When the true precision matrix is sparse and of high dimension, the GR2D2 provides the estimates with smallest information divergence from the underlying truth. We also compare the GR2D2 estimator to the graphical horseshoe estimator in five cancer RNA-seq gene expression datasets grouped by three cancer types. Our results show that GR2D2 successfully identifies common cancer pathways and cancer-specific pathways for each dataset.",
