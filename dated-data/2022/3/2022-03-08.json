    "abstract": "O_LIImage sensing technologies are rapidly increasing the cost-effectiveness of biodiversity monitoring efforts. Species differences in the reflectance of electromagnetic radiation have recently been highlighted as a promising target to estimate plant biodiversity using multispectral image data.\nC_LIO_LIHowever, these efforts are currently hampered by logistical difficulties in broad-scale implementation and their use in characterizing biodiversity at different spatial scales.\nC_LIO_LIHere, we investigate the utility of multispectral imaging technology from commercially available unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs, or drones) in estimating biodiversity metrics at short-range (<10 m image recording height) in a temperate calcareous grassland ecosystem in Oxfordshire, UK. We calculate a suite of moments (coefficient of variation, standard deviation, skew, kurtosis) for the distribution of radiance from multispectral images at five wavelength bands (Blue 450{+/-}16 nm; Green 560{+/-}16 nm; Red 650{+/-}16 nm; Red Edge 730{+/-}16 nm; Near Infrared 840{+/-}16 nm) and test their effectiveness at estimating ground-truthed biodiversity metrics from in-situ botanical surveys for 37 - 1 m x 1 m quadrats.\nC_LIO_LIWe find positive associations between the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance and both the Shannon-Weiner and Simpsons biodiversity indices. Furthermore, we find that the average coefficient of variation in spectral radiance is consistent and highly repeatable, across sampling days and recording heights. Positive associations with biodiversity indices hold irrespective of the image recording height (2-8 m), but we report reductions in estimates of spectral diversity with increases to UAV recording height. UAV imaging reduced sampling time by 16-fold relative to in-situ botanical surveys.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis - We demonstrate the utility of multispectral radiance moments as an indicator of grassland biodiversity metrics at high spatial resolution using a widely available UAV monitoring system at a coarse spectral resolution. The use of UAV technology with multispectral sensors has far-reaching potential to provide cost-effective and high-resolution monitoring of biodiversity in complex environments.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "It is often assumed that recreational fishing has negligible impact on fish stocks compared to commercial fishing. Yet, for inland water bodies in densely populated areas, this is unlikely to be true. In this study we demonstrate remarkably variable stock recovery rates among different fish species with similar life histories in a large productive inland freshwater ecosystem (Kaunas Reservoir, Lithuania), where all commercial fishing has been banned since 2013. We conducted over 900 surveys of recreational anglers during a period of four years (2016 to 2021) to assess recreational fishing catches. These surveys are combined with drone and fishfinder device-based assessment of recreational fishing effort. Fish population recovery rates were assessed using standardised catch per unit effort time series. We show that recreational fishing is having a major impact in retarding the recovery of predatory species, such as pikeperch and perch. In contrast, recovery of roach, rarely caught by anglers, has been remarkably rapid and the species is now dominating the ecosystem. Our study demonstrates that recreational fishing can have strong impacts on some fish species, alter relative species composition and potentially change ecosystem state and dynamics.",

    "abstract": "If humans aim to sustainably coexist with wildlife, we must understand how our activity impacts the communication systems of urban animal populations. We know much about the effects of anthropogenic noise on bird song, but relatively little about how avian visual signals are affected by urbanization. One way such an effect may occur if urbanization alters the food available to species with color based on carotenoids, which they must obtain from their diet. Over three years, we compared a comprehensive suite of visual signals in male and female Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinals) in a rural and an urban population. We predicted that urban birds would have enhanced carotenoid-based signals as they likely have access to more carotenoids from invasive plants, especially honeysuckle (Lonicera spp.), that thrive in cities. We used reflectance spectrometry, digital image analyses, and avian visual models to quantify hue, saturation, and brightness of chest (male), underwing (female), and bill (male and female) signals. Compared to rural males, urban males had redder chest feathers in one year and redder bills in every year. Urban females had more saturated underwing color than rural females in every year. These color differences were sufficient to be distinguished by the avian visual system. Urbanization did not affect female bill color. Interestingly, urban birds had significantly reduced mass-related body condition compared to rural birds. These results show that both male and female urban birds can display enhanced carotenoid-based signals despite being in relatively poor condition. The consequences of this color enhancement are unknown, but it could affect the information content of the signals and the dynamics of the social and mating systems. These results stand in stark contrast to the predominant trend in birds of decreased color in urban areas and highlight the complex and varied potential effects of urbanization on animal communication.",

    "abstract": "Recent innovations in droplet-based single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) have provided the technology necessary to investigate biological questions at cellular resolution. With the ability to assay thousands of cells in a single capture, pooling cells from multiple individuals has become a common strategy. Droplets can subsequently be assigned to a specific individual by leveraging their inherent genetic differences, and numerous computational methods have been developed to address this problem. However, another challenge implicit with droplet-based scRNA-seq is the occurrence of doublets - droplets containing two or more cells. The inaccurate assignment of cells to individuals or failure to remove doublets contribute unwanted noise to the data and result in erroneous scientific conclusions. Therefore, it is essential to assign cells to individuals and remove doublets accurately. We present a new framework to improve individual singlet classification and doublet removal through a multi-method intersectional approach.\n\nWe developed a framework to evaluate the enhancement in donor assignment and doublet removal through the consensus intersection of multiple demultiplexing and doublet detecting methods. The accuracy was assessed using scRNA-seq data of [~]1.4 million peripheral blood mononucleated cells from 1,034 unrelated individuals and [~]90,000 fibroblast cells from 81 unrelated individuals. We show that our approach significantly improves droplet assignment by separating singlets from doublets and classifying the correct individual compared to any single method. We show that the best combination of techniques varies under different biological and experimental conditions, and we present a framework to optimise cell assignment for a given experiment. We offer Demuxafy (https://demultiplexing-doublet-detecting-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - a framework built-in Singularity to provide clear, consistent documentation of each method and additional tools to simplify and improve demultiplexing and doublet removal. Our results indicate that leveraging multiple demultiplexing and doublet detecting methods improves accuracy and, consequently, downstream analyses in multiplexed scRNA-seq experiments.",

    "abstract": "Formaldehyde (CH2O) and acetaldehyde (C2H4O) are reactive small molecules produced endogenously in cells as well as being environmental contaminants. Both of these small aldehydes are classified as human carcinogens, since they are known to damage DNA and exposure is linked to cancer incidence. However, the mutagenic properties of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde remain incompletely understood, at least in part because they are relatively weak mutagens. Here, we use a highly sensitive yeast genetic reporter system featuring controlled generation of long single-stranded DNA regions to show that both small aldehydes induced mutational patterns characterized by predominantly C/G [-&gt;] A/T, C/G [-&gt;] T/A, and T/A [-&gt;] C/G substitutions, each in similar proportions. We observed an excess of C/G [-&gt;] A/T transversions when compared to mock-treated controls. Many of these C/G [-&gt;] A/T transversions occurred at TC/GA motifs. Interestingly, the formaldehyde mutational pattern resembles single base substitution (SBS) signature 40 from the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC). SBS40 is a mutational signature of unknown etiology. We also noted that acetaldehyde treatment caused an excess of deletion events longer than four bases while formaldehyde did not. This latter result could be another distinguishing feature between the mutational patterns of these simple aldehydes. These findings shed new light on the characteristics of two important, commonly occurring mutagens.",

    "abstract": "In light of the rapid rise of an influenza pandemic, the constant genetic mutations of H5N1 influenza viruses pose a threat. Mutations at the sialic site are often responsible for multiple drug resistance. To design effective new inhibitors, it is necessary to undertake research into the mechanism of resistance of influenza viruses and their rapid mutations. The molecular dynamic simulation technique has been an instrumental tool in understanding how proteins function from an atomic perspective. A thorough investigation has not been conducted using molecular dynamics to examine the impact of these mutations (I222K, H274Y, and H274Y-I222K) on Peramivir. This study investigates the effects of I222K, H274Y, H274Y-I222K substitution on the neuraminidase-Peramivir complex and identifies responsible residues for complex conformations. The mutations caused distorted Peramivir orientation in the enzyme active site, which affected the inhibitors binding. In the presence of various mutations, interaction between protein and ligand became less thermodynamically favorable. We observed the following trend in binding free energy difference: WT<I222<H274Y<H274Y-I222K. As a result of the thermodynamic instability of the mutant complexes, Peramivirs potency is reduced due to impaired binding interactions. Wild type complex displays thermodynamic stability and strong protein-ligand interactions due to their high total energy contributions and low residue flexibility. Based on the energy decomposition analysis, Arg117, Arg224, and Arg292 contributed the largest residual energy for the binding of Peramivir to wild type and mutants. These residues are thought to play a key role in the formation of the binding pocket between Peramivir and neuraminidase. This study provides a basis for investigating the effects of other mutations on Peramivirs efficacy against the H5N1 virus.",

    "abstract": "Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptors (IP3Rs) initiate a diverse array of physiological responses by carefully orchestrating intracellular calcium (Ca2+) signals in response to various external cues. Notably, IP3R channel activity is determined by several obligatory factors including IP3, Ca2+ and ATP. The critical basic amino acid residues in the N-terminal IP3-binding core (IBC) region that facilitate IP3 binding are well characterized. In contrast, the residues conferring the biphasic regulation by Ca2+ are yet to be ascertained. Using comparative structural analysis of Ca2+ binding sites identified in two main families of intracellular Ca2+-release channels, ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and IP3Rs, we identified putative acidic residues coordinating Ca2+ in the cytosolic calcium sensor region in IP3Rs. We determined the consequences of substituting putative Ca2+ binding, acidic residues in IP3R family members. We show that the agonist-induced Ca2+ release, single channel open probability (P0) and Ca2+ sensitivities are markedly altered when the negative charge on the conserved acidic side chain residues are neutralized. Remarkably, neutralizing the negatively charged side chain on two of the residues individually in the putative Ca2+ binding pocket shifted the Ca2+ required to activate IP3R to higher concentrations, indicating that these residues likely are a component of the Ca2+ activation site in IP3R. Taken together, our findings indicate that Ca2+ binding to a well conserved activation site is a common underlying mechanism resulted in increased channel activity shared by IP3Rs and RyRs.",

    "abstract": "Transgenic expression of a tagged protein under control of its native promoter is the typical strategy to investigate tissue-specific accumulation and subcellular localization of a protein of interest. In some cases, difficulties in promoter identification, altered promoter function when placed in a new genomic context, and variability between transgenic lines can complicate such experiments. Crispr/CAS9-enabled homologous recombination to insert a tag in frame with an endogenous gene could circumvent these problems. Apart from work at a few loci used to test gene targeting (GT) protocols, there have been relatively few reports of GT to knock-in protein tags in Arabidopsis thaliana, and little data of whether expression of the knock-in allele accurately reflects that of the wild-type gene. We investigated these questions using a two-stage GT procedure where a starter line expressing hyper-accurate CAS9 (hypaCAS9) under control of the Egg Cell1.1 (EC1.1) promoter was transformed with an mCitrine (YFP) donor sequence flanked by homology arms for homologous recombination at the N- or C-terminal ends of the stress-responsive genes At14a-Like 1 (AFL1) and {Delta}1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase 1 (P5CS1). We observed high frequency GT to generate in frame fusions of YFP at either the N- or C-terminus of AFL1 and at the N-terminus of P5CS1. AFL1-YFP was produced from the knock-in locus; however, the N-terminal knock-ins disrupted AFL1 and P5CS1 expression. These results show that the combination of EC1.1 promoter and hypaCAS9 along with selection of a starter line with strong hypaCAS9 expression produced good GT frequencies, indicating that this approach can be feasible to knock-in or replace sequence at many loci. However, we also offer a cautionary tale that insertions generated by GT can interfere with gene expression for reasons which are yet unclear. Further refinement of this approach is a potentially useful tool to produce tagged proteins from their endogenous genomic loci.",

    "abstract": "Mass cytometers can record 40-50 parameters per single cell for millions of cells in a sample, and in particular, for leukemic cells. Many methods have been developed to cluster phenotypically similar cells within cytometry data, but there are fewer methods to visualize activity and interactions of pairs of proteins across these populations. We have developed a workflow for analyzing correlations associated with predfined populations. By clustering blood samples from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and normal controls using an established algorithm, we obtained a minimum spanning tree of clusters of single cells. Using surface marker expression, we identified clusters on the tree that belonged to phenotypes of interest. Next, we computed correlations between pairs of proteins in each cluster. We developed a novel, coherent, probability-based statistic to test differences between vectors of correlation coefficients. By comparing all combinations of the normal controls under the statistic, we created an empirical distribution that provided a conservative measure of differential correlation. Using this empirically-derived distribution to define significance, we compared pooled samples from AML subtypes and normal controls to detect differential correlations. Given the structure present within this cytometry data set, we found it natural to consider correlations in this manner versus aggregating all data and computing a single correlation. Our results have the advantage that we can localize the statistical measure to determine contributions from particular phenotypic populations. Differentially correlated pairs of proteins can be further explored by considering a populations distribution of correlation coefficients or biaxially plotting protein expressions within individual cells in a given population. Our approach leads to a better understanding of the nonlinear relationships that exist in the cytometry data.\n\nAuthor summaryWe introduce a novel method for analyzing the abundance of single cell data collected by high-throughput technologies. Due to the high dimensionality of such datasets, there is a need for methods to identify significant interactions between genes or proteins. In particular, we are interested in statistical differences between correlations of proteins within populations of cells determined by traditional immunophenotyping techniques. In this paper, we have demonstrated the utility of this new framework in the case of blood samples from individuals with different subtypes of leukemia and compare to healthy controls. The motivation for this application is that differences between can illuminate potential drivers of the disease. We have illustrated an example of how intracellular events can be detected by our statistic. Finally, this method is flexible in that it can also be applied in a variety of contexts where there are vectors of correlation coefficients that need to be compared.",

Proteomic analysis showed that putative CBD receptors are expressed at similar levels in the brains of Cln1-/- mice compared to normal animals. Cln1-/- mice received an oral dose (100mg/kg/day) of CBD for six months and were evaluated for changes in pathological markers of disease and seizures. Chronic cannabidiol administration was well-tolerated, high levels of CBD were detected in the brain, and markers of astrocytosis and microgliosis were reduced. However, CBD had no apparent effect on seizure frequency or neuron survival. These data are consistent with CBD having immunomodulatory effects. It is possible that a higher dose of CBD could also reduce neurodegeneration and seizure frequency.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral studies suggest that recurrence in the visual system is important for processing degraded stimuli. There are two broad anatomical forms this recurrence can take, lateral or feedback, each with different assumed functions. Here we add four different kinds of recurrence--two of each anatomical form--to a feedforward convolutional neural network and find all forms capable of increasing the ability of the network to classify noisy digit images. Specifically, we take inspiration from findings in biology by adding predictive feedback and lateral surround suppression. To compare these forms of recurrence to anatomically-matched counterparts we also train feedback and lateral connections directly to classify degraded images. Counter-intuitively, we find that the anatomy of the recurrence is not related to its function: both forms of task-trained recurrence change neural activity and behavior similarly to each other and differently from their bio-inspired anatomical counterparts. By using several analysis tools frequently applied to neural data, we identified the distinct strategies used by the predictive versus task-trained networks. Specifically, predictive feedback de-noises the representation of noisy images at the first layer of the network and decreases its dimensionality, leading to an expected increase in classification performance. Surprisingly, in the task-trained networks, representations are not de-noised over time at the first layer (in fact, they become  noiser and dimensionality increases) yet these dynamics do lead to de-noising at later layers. The analyses used here can be applied to real neural recordings to identify the strategies at play in the brain. Our analysis of an fMRI dataset weakly supports the predictive feedback model but points to a need for higher-resolution cross-regional data to understand recurrent visual processing..",

    "abstract": "Nociception is a neural process that animals have developed to avoid potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. While nociception is triggered in the peripheral nervous system, its modulation by the central nervous system is a critical process in mammals, whose dysfunction has been extensively implicated in chronic pain pathogenesis. The peripheral mechanisms of nociception are largely conserved across the animal kingdom. However, it is unclear whether the brain-mediated modulation is also conserved in non-mammalian species. Here, we show that Drosophila has a descending inhibitory mechanism of nociception from the brain, mediated by the neuropeptide Drosulfakinin (DSK), a homolog of cholecystokinin (CCK) that plays an important role in the descending control of nociception in mammals. We found that mutants lacking dsk or its receptors are hypersensitive to noxious heat. Through a combination of genetic, behavioral, histological, and Ca2+ imaging analyses, we subsequently revealed neurons involved in DSK-mediated nociceptive regulation at a single-cell resolution and identified a DSKergic descending neuronal pathway that inhibits nociception. This study provides the first evidence for a descending modulatory mechanism of nociception from the brain in a non-mammalian species that is mediated by the evolutionarily conserved CCK system, raising the possibility that the descending inhibition is an ancient mechanism to regulate nociception.",

    "abstract": "Astrocytes are integral functional components of brain circuits. They ensheath the connections between neurons to form tripartite synapses. They react to local neuronal activities and release signaling molecules to regulate synaptic transmission. Their dysfunctions impair synaptic functions and are implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. Increasing evidence indicates that astrocytes are diverse and they have distinct features and functions in different circuits. However, selectively targeting and controlling astrocytes in a circuit-specific manner is technically challenging. Recently we constructed a series of anterograde transneuronal viral vectors based on the yellow fever vaccine YFV-17D. These YFV-17D derivatives express fluorescent proteins almost exclusively in neurons. However, we find that YFV-17D carrying DNA recombinase Cre infect astrocytes associated with the traced neuronal pathways and express Cre to turn on reporter genes. The targeting of astrocytes is at a whole-brain level but specific to the neuronal circuits traced. Therefore, YFV-17D vectors carrying DNA recombinases provide tools for selectively and genetically targeting pathway-specific astrocytes. This new technology will also allow us to reveal the roles of astrocytes in specific neuronal circuits in normal brain functions and diseases.",

    "abstract": "Vagal fibers travel inside fascicles and form branches to innervate organs and regulate organ functions. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) therapies activate fibers non-selectively, often resulting in reduced efficacy and side effects from non-targeted organs. Transverse and longitudinal arrangement of fibers according to functions they mediate and organs they innervate is unknown, however it is crucial for selective VNS. Using microcomputed tomography, we found that, in swine, fascicles are arranged in 2 overlapping axes, with sensory and motor fascicles separated cephalad and merging caudad, and larynx-, heart- and lung-specific fascicles separated caudad and progressively merging cephalad. Using immunohistochemistry, we found that the distribution of single fibers is highly nonuniform: myelinated afferents and efferents occupy separate fascicles, unmyelinated efferents co-localize with myelinated afferents, and small unmyelinated afferents are widely distributed. Using a multi-contact cuff electrode, we delivered fascicular cervical VNS in anesthetized and awake swine. Compound action potentials, from distinct fiber types, and organ responses, including laryngeal muscle, cough, breathing, heart rate and blood pressure responses are elicited in a radially asymmetric manner, with consistent angular separations. These results indicate that vagal fibers are anatomically organized according to functions they mediate and organs they innervate and can be asymmetrically activated by fascicular cervical VNS.",

    "abstract": "Thirst emerges from a range of cellular changes that ultimately motivate an animal to consume water. Although thirst-responsive neuronal signals have been reported, the full complement of brain responses is unclear. Here we identify molecular and cellular adaptations in the brain using single-cell sequencing of water deprived Drosophila. Water deficiency primarily altered the glial transcriptome. Screening the regulated genes revealed astrocytic expression of the astray-encoded phosphoserine phosphatase to bi-directionally regulate water consumption. Astray synthesizes the gliotransmitter D-serine and vesicular release from astrocytes is required for drinking. Moreover, dietary D-serine rescues aay-dependent drinking deficits while facilitating water consumption and expression of water-seeking memory. D-serine action requires binding to neuronal NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Fly astrocytes contribute processes to tripartite synapses and the proportion of astrocytes that are themselves activated by glutamate increases with water deprivation. We propose that thirst elevates astrocytic D-serine release, which awakens quiescent glutamatergic circuits to enhance water procurement.",

    "abstract": "Nucleic acid extraction is the first step in molecular biology studies of soil bacterial communities. The most common used soil DNA extraction method is the direct, hard extraction Mobio method, which uses bead beating to lyse bacteria. In this study we compared the Mobio method with a soft, enzymatic lysis extraction method. Next generation sequencing (Illumina and Pyrosequencing) of amplicons generated from four 16S primer pairs and DNA from 12 soils and 3 composts was used to compare the two extraction methods.\n\nFour bacterial orders, the delta proteobacterial Desulfuromonadales and gamma proteobacterial Pseudomonadales, Enterobacteriales, and Alteromonadales were more common in amplicons from soft extracted DNA, sometimes by two orders of magnitude. These groups can be a significant fraction of the bacterial population. For example the Pseudomonadales made up to 16 % and Enterobacteriales 10% of amplicons from Soft extracted DNA. The JG30-KF-CM45 order was under extracted by the enzymatic lysis extraction method. Results differed more by primer choice than extraction method and the phylogenetic resolution of differences between extraction methods changed with primer choice.\n\nGiven how often Mobio extraction is used, these proteobacterial orders are probably under-represented in the studies of soil bacteria that use nucleic acid methods. Further improvements in soil DNA extraction are needed. Amplicons sequencing studies should use a range of different primers to confirm the phylogenetic resolution of their results.\n\nImportanceSeveral large scale studies of soil bacteria that compare thousands of soil samples across continents have used the Mobio method for DNA extraction. Large scale studies like these are increasing with the recent establishment of the Global Soil Biodiversity Observation Network (Soil BON), which also uses the Mobio method. The results of this work will be used to make policy decisions about how to manage the soil and may be a guide for bioprospectors. As the Mobio method is so widely used, it is important to know its limitations. Studies that use the Mobio method underestimate the fraction of several proteobacterial groups. Most notably the Enterobacteria and Pseudomonas can be under extracted by 10-100 fold. The degree of under extraction varies with different soils.",

    "abstract": "Sour beers produced by barrel-aging of conventionally fermented beers are becoming increasingly popular. However, as the intricate interactions between the wood, the microbes and the beer are still unclear, wood maturation often leads to inconsistent end products with undesired sensory properties. Previous research on industrial barrel-aging of beer suggests that beer parameters like the ethanol content and bitterness play an important role in the microbial community composition and beer chemistry, but their exact impact still remains to be investigated. In this study, an experimentally tractable lab-scale system based on an in-vitro community of four key bacteria (Acetobacter malorum, Gluconobacter oxydans, Lactobacillus brevis and Pediococcus damnosus) and four key yeasts (Brettanomyces bruxellensis, Candida friedrichii, Pichia membranifaciens and Saccharomyces cerevisiae) that are consistently associated with barrel-aging of beer, was used to test the hypotheses that beer ethanol and bitterness impact microbial community composition and beer chemistry. Experiments were performed using different levels of ethanol (5.2 v/v%, 8 v/v% and 11 v/v%) and bitterness (13 ppm, 35 ppm and 170 ppm iso--acids), and beers were matured for 60 days. Samples were taken after 0, 10, 20, 30 and 60 days to monitor population densities and beer chemistry. Results revealed that all treatments and the maturation time significantly affected the microbial community composition and beer chemistry. More specifically, the ethanol treatments obstructed growth of L. brevis and G. oxydans and delayed fungal growth. The iso--acid treatments hindered growth of L. brevis and stimulated growth of P. membranifaciens, while the other strains remained unaffected. Beer chemistry was found to be affected by higher ethanol levels, which led to an increased extraction of wood-derived compounds. Furthermore, the distinct microbial communities also induced changes in the chemical composition of the beer samples, leading to concentration differences in beer- and wood-derived compounds like 4-ethyl guaiacol, 4-ethyl phenol, cis-oak lactone, vanillin, furfural and 5-methyl furfural. Altogether, our results indicate that wood-aging of beer is affected by biotic and abiotic parameters, influencing the quality of the final product. Additionally, this work provides a new, cost-effective approach to study the production of barrel-aged beers based on a simplified microbial community model.",

We have isolated \"Ascunsovirus oldenburgi\" ICBM5, a novel phage distantly related to known Microviridae. It infects Sulfitobacter dubius SH24-1b and uses both a lytic and a carrier-state life strategy. Using ICBM5 proteins as a query, we uncovered in publicly available resources 65 new microviridae prophages and episomes in bacterial genomes and retrieved 47 environmental viral genomes (EVGs) from various viromes. Genome clustering based on protein content and phylogenetic analysis showed that ICBM5, together with Rhizobium phages, new prophages, episomes, and EVGs cluster within two new phylogenetic clades, here tentatively assigned the rank of subfamily and named \"Tainavirinae\" and \"Occultatumvirinae\". They both infect Rhodobacterales. Occultatumviruses also infect Hyphomicrobiales, including nitrogen-fixing endosymbionts from cosmopolitan legumes. A biogeographical assessment showed that tainaviruses and occultatumviruses are spread worldwide, in terrestrial and marine environments. The new phage isolated here shed light onto new and diverse branches of the Microviridae tree, suggesting that much of the ssDNA phage diversity remains in the dark.",

    "abstract": "VPS13 is a eukaryotic lipid transport protein localized at membrane contact sites. Previous studies suggested that it may transfer lipids between adjacent bilayers by a bridge-like mechanism. Direct evidence for this hypothesis from a full-length structure and from EM studies in situ, however, is still missing. Here we have capitalized on AlphaFold predictions to complement the structural information already available about VPS13 and to generate a full-length model of human VPS13C, the Parkinsons disease-linked VPS13 paralog localized at contacts between the ER and endo/lysosomes. Such model predicts a ~30-nm rod with a hydrophobic groove that extends throughout its length. We further investigated whether such a structure can be observed in situ at ER-endo/lysosome contacts. To this aim, we combined genetic approaches with cryo-focused-ion-beam (cryo-FIB) milling and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) to examine HeLa cells overexpressing this protein (either full length or with an internal truncation) along with VAP, its anchoring binding partner at the ER. Using these methods we identified rod-like densities that span the space separating the two adjacent membranes and that match the predicted structures of either full length VPS13C or its shorter truncated mutant, thus providing the first in-situ evidence for a bridge-model of VPS13 in lipid transport. Intriguingly, the majority of the VPS13C rods were separated from the ER membranes by a narrow gap, suggesting that while VAP anchors the protein to the ER, direct contact of the VPS13C rod with the ER bilayer to allow lipid transport may be independently regulated.",

Phagosome formation, the initial step of the process, is characterized by local membrane remodelling and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton that leads to formation of the pseudopods that drive particle engulfment. Using genetically-encoded fluorescent probes we found that upon particle engagement a localized pool of PtdIns(3,4)P2 is generated by the sequential activities of class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases and phosphoinositide 5-phosphatases. Depletion of the enzymes responsible for this locally generated pool of PtdIns(3,4)P2 blocks pseudopod progression and ultimately phagocytosis. We show that the PtdIns(3,4)P2 effector Lamellipodin (Lpd) is recruited to nascent phagosomes by PtdIns(3,4)P2. Furthermore, we show that silencing of Lpd inhibits phagocytosis and produces aberrant pseudopodia with disorganized actin filaments. Lastly, vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) was identified as a key actin-regulatory protein mediating phagosome formation downstream of Lpd. Mechanistically, our findings imply that a pathway involving PtdIns(3,4)P2, Lpd and VASP mediates phagocytosis at the stage of particle engulfment.",

To explore this question, we measured two plant-related parameters and four leaf-related parameters over five growth stages during the 2017-2021 growing seasons. A hierarchical linear model (HLM) automatically adapts the relationship between VIs and their corresponding parameter across growing seasons and assesses the contribution of phenological variables by applying a sensitivity analysis. The estimates of VI-plant-related parameters [aboveground dry biomass (AGB) and plant nitrogen concentration (PNC)] were scattered over a given growing season, unlike the relationship between VI-leaf-related parameters [leaf dry biomass (LGB), leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC), leaf area index (LAI) and soil and plant analysis development (SPAD)]. In contrast, the AGB, PNC, LGB, LNC, LAI, and SPAD HLM models are stable and can be popularized across growing seasons, with the determination coefficient R2 ranging from 0.84 to 0.86, 0.79 to 0.87, 0.70 to 0.71, 0.68 to 0.86, 0.75 to 0.81, and 0.68 to 0.70, respectively, and the root mean square error ranging from 0.13 to 0.50 t/ha, 0.01 to 0.07%, 0.01 to 0.03 t/ha, 0.02 to 0.03%, 0.02 to 0.07, and 0.47 to 0.69, respectively. The sensitivity index of the phenological information in the AGB and PNC models was 0.56-0.78 and 0.66-0.72, respectively, whereas that in the LGB, LNC, LAI, and SPAD models was 0.01-0.06, 0.01-0.10, 0.02-0.06, and 0.00-0.01, respectively.

    "abstract": "The human gut microbiome contains a diversity of microbial species that varies in composition over time and across individuals. These species (and strains within species) can migrate across hosts and evolve by mutation and recombination within hosts. How the ecological process of community assembly interacts with intra-species diversity and evolutionary change is a longstanding question. Two contrasting hypotheses have been proposed based on ecological observations and theory: Diversity Begets Diversity (DBD), in which taxa tend to become more diverse in already diverse communities, and Ecological Controls (EC), in which higher community diversity impedes diversification within taxa. Previously, using 16S rRNA gene amplicon data across a range of environments, we showed a generally positive relationship between taxa diversity and community diversity at higher taxonomic levels, consistent with the predictions of DBD (Madi et al., 2020). However, this positive  diversity slope reaches a plateau at high levels of community diversity. Here we show that this general pattern holds at much finer genetic resolution, by analyzing intra-species strain and nucleotide variation in static and temporally sampled shotgun-sequenced fecal metagenomes from cohorts of healthy human hosts. We find that both intra-species polymorphism and strain number are positively correlated with community Shannon diversity. This trend is consistent with DBD, although we cannot exclude abiotic drivers of diversity. Shannon diversity is also predictive of increases in polymorphism over time scales up to [~]4-6 months, after which the diversity slope flattens and then becomes negative--consistent with DBD eventually giving way to EC. Also supporting a complex mixture of DBD and EC, the number of strains per focal species is positively associated with Shannon diversity but negatively associated with richness. Finally, we show that higher community diversity predicts gene loss in a focal species at a future time point. This observation is broadly consistent with the Black Queen Hypothesis, which posits that genes with functions provided by the community are less likely to be retained in a focal species genome. Together, our results show that a mixture of DBD, EC, and Black Queen may operate simultaneously in the human gut microbiome, adding to a growing body of evidence that these eco-evolutionary processes are key drivers of biodiversity and ecosystem function.",

    "abstract": "IntroductoryThis study was undertaken to assess the on-farm genetic diversity of wheat Landraces (Triticum aestivum spp) in Digalu and Tijo District.\n\nMethodsFor this study, three farmer households kebeles were selected by cluster sampling (area sampling) method because they are found in the most dominant wheat landraces growing agro-ecological areas. Data for this study was collected using questionnaires, field observation, interviews, focus group discussion, and document analysis.\n\nResults and DiscussionsIn total, 27 wheat landraces were reported to be grown before two decades to the present day. Of these, only 9 of wheat landraces are still cultivated by farmers. Among these,  Qamadi guracha is the most common growing landraces in the study area. The Shannon diversity index (H) of growing wheat landraces ranges from 1.09 to 1.37 among the groups. The estimated genetic erosion for wheat landraces was found to be 66.7% due to the major factors: improved wheat varieties; the introduction of other more productive crops and wheat landraces low productivity.\n\nConclusionsFood quality, Pests (example, birds), diseases resistance, market value, and straw quality were factors that initiated the farmers to maintain the genetic diversity of landraces on their farmlands. However, the preservation of wheat landraces are influenced by bottlenecks like the seed selection system, and insufficient crop yield.\n\nRecommendationRegeneration of soil fertility, restoring of lost landraces, improvement of landraces, on-farm conservation by re-sowing, saving of seeds for future, and ex-situ conservation is suggested for the restoration of wheat landraces diversity in Digalu and Tijo District.",

    "abstract": "Upper body function is lost when injuries are sustained to the cervical spinal cord. Assistive machines can support the loss in upper body motor function. To regain functionality at the level of performing activities of daily living (e.g., self-feeding), though, assistive machines need to be able to operate in high dimensions. This means there is a need for interfaces with the capability to match high-dimensional operation. The body-machine interface provides this capability and has shown to be a suitable interface even for individuals with limited mobility. This is because it can take advantage of peoples available residual body movements. Previous studies using this interface have only shown that the interface can control low-dimensional assistive machines. In this pilot study, we demonstrate the interface can scale to high-dimensional robots, can be learned to control a 7-dimensional assistive robotic arm, to perform complex reaching and functional tasks, by an uninjured population. We also share results from various analyses that hint at learning, even when performance is extremely low. Decoupling intrinsic correlations between robot control dimensions seem to be a factor in learning--that is, proficiency in activating each control dimension independently may contribute to learning and skill acquisition of high-dimensional robot control. In addition, we show that learning to control the robot and learning to perform complex movement tasks can occur simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe standard approach for statistical inference in differential expression (DE) analyses is to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR). However, controlling the FDR does not in fact imply that the proportion of false discoveries is upper bounded. Moreover, no statistical guarantee can be given on subsets of genes selected by FDR thresholding. These known limitations are overcome by post hoc inference, which provides guarantees of the number of proportion of false discoveries among arbitrary gene selections. However, post hoc inference methods are not yet widely used for DE studies.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we demonstrate the relevance and illustrate the performance of adaptive interpolation-based post hoc methods for DE studies. First, we formalize the use of permutation-based methods to obtain sharp confidence bounds that are adaptive to the dependence between genes. Then, we introduce a generic linear time algorithm for computing post hoc bounds, making these bounds applicable to large-scale DE studies. The use of the resulting Adaptive Simes bound is illustrated on a RNA sequencing study. Comprehensive numerical experiments based on real microarray and RNA sequencing data demonstrate the statistical performance of the method.\n\nAvailabilityA cross-platform open source implementation within the R package sanssouci is available at https://pneuvial.github.io/sanssouci/.",

    "abstract": "Aneuploidy is a hallmark of cancer, but its complex nature limits our understanding of how it drives oncogenesis. Gain of chromosome 21 (Hsa21) is among the most frequent aneuploidies in leukemia and is associated with markedly increased leukemia risk. Here, we propose that disequilibrium of the RUNX1 isoforms is key to the pathogenesis of trisomy 21 (i.e. Down syndrome)-associated myeloid leukemia (ML-DS). Hsa21-focused CRISPR-Cas9 screens uncovered a strong and specific RUNX1 dependency in ML-DS. Mechanistic studies revealed that excess of RUNX1A isoform - as seen in ML-DS patients - synergized with the pathognomonic Gata1s mutation in leukemogenesis by displacing RUNX1C from its endogenous binding sites and inducing oncogenic programs in complex with the MYC cofactor MAX. These effects were reversed by restoring the RUNX1A:RUNX1C equilibrium or pharmacological interference with MYC:MAX dimerization. Our study highlights the importance of alternative splicing in leukemogenesis, even on a background of aneuploidies, and opens new avenues for developing specific and targeted therapies.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/483334v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16c5a95org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@af0ec7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f36bcborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@129e832_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities are important elements in the marine environment, contributing to nutrient cycling and biogeochemical processes. Estuaries comprise environments exhibiting characteristics from freshwater to marine, leading to distinct microbial communities across this environmental gradient. Here, we examine the spatial dynamics of microbial communities in Macquarie Harbour, an estuarine system on the West coast of Tasmania, Australia. Water was sampled along the estuary to explore the structure and composition of the microbial communities using 16S/18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Multivariate analyses showed environmental variables and community compositions varying along a longitudinal (river to adjacent ocean) gradient at the surface. In the harbour, differences in the microbial community were observed between surface (0-1 m) and intermediate depths (4.5-11 m depth). The results of differential abundance, network and Partial Least Square analyses suggest that Macquarie Harbour is a mixing zone, where the distributions of archaeal, bacterial and eukaryotic communities are influenced by oceanic and riverine inputs. Coupled with the natural characteristics of the Harbour, the heterotrophic component of this microbial communities inhabiting the surface and intermediate waters may play important roles in the nutrient cycle in the studied area. These results provide critical insights into the Macquarie Harbour environment and the importance of understanding the role of microbial communities for similar systems elsewhere.",

    "abstract": "The recognition that cytosolic mtDNA activates cGAS-STING innate immune signaling has unlocked novel disease mechanisms. Here, an uncharacterized variant predicted to affect TOP1MT function, P193L, was discovered in a family with multiple early-onset autoimmune diseases, including Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Although there was no previous genetic association between TOP1MT and autoimmune disease, the role of TOP1MT as a regulator of mtDNA led us to investigate whether TOP1MT could mediate the release of mtDNA to the cytosol, where it could then activate the cGAS-STING innate immune pathway known to be activated in SLE and other autoimmune diseases. Through analysis of cells with reduced TOP1MT expression, we show that loss of TOP1MT results in release of mtDNA to the cytosol, which activates the cGAS-STING pathway. We also characterized the P193L variant for its ability to rescue several TOP1MT functions when expressed in TOP1MT knockout cells. We show that the P193L variant is not fully functional, as its re-expression at high levels was unable to rescue mitochondrial respiration deficits, and only showed partial rescue for other functions, including repletion of mtDNA replication following depletion, nucleoid size, steady state mtDNA transcripts levels, and mitochondrial morphology. Additionally, expression of P193L at endogenous levels was unable to rescue mtDNA release-mediated cGAS-STING signaling. Overall, we report a link between TOP1MT and mtDNA release leading to cGAS-STING activation. Moreover, we show that the P193L variant has partial loss of function that may contribute to autoimmune disease susceptibility via cGAS-STING mediated activation of the innate immune system.",

In the present study, we explored how inhibition of distractors is learned within a Sternberg-like WM task and how this learning process affects readout performance. We introduced distractors of varying strength as well as novel stimuli to a classic Sternberg task. Our findings show that the length of the training period affected obstructiveness of distractors as well as differences between WM loads. Significant differences between conditions observed early on in accuracy became void after general ceiling performance was reached. Moreover, accuracy and reaction times, which are commonly used as readouts of WM performance, were affected differently by training. While both improved significantly, only accuracy exhibited differential dependency of experimental conditions on training. It is essential to consider these dynamics when introducing a WM task which requires a long training period.",

    "abstract": "Following Delta, Omicron variant triggered a new wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally, adaptive evolution of the virus may not stop, the development of broad-spectrum antivirals is still urgent. We previously developed two hetero-bivalent nanobodies with potent neutralization against original WT SARS-CoV-2, termed aRBD-2-5 and aRBD-2-7, by fusing aRBD-2 with aRBD-5 or aRBD-7, respectively. Here, we resolved crystal structures of these nanobodies in complex with RBD, and found the epitope of aRBD-2 differs from that of aRBD-5, aRBD-7. aRBD-2 binds to a conserved epitope which renders its binding activity to all variants of concern (VOCs) including Omicron. Interestingly, although monovalent aRBD-5 and aRBD-7 lost binding to some variants, they effectively improved the overall affinity when transformed into the hetero-bivalent form after being fused with aRBD-2. Consistent with the high binding affinities, aRBD-2-5-Fc and aRBD-2-7-Fc exhibited ultra-potent neutralization to all five VOCs; particularly, aRBD-2-5-Fc neutralized authentic virus of Beta, Delta and Omicron with the IC50of 5.98[~]9.65 ng/mL or 54.3[~]87.6 pM. Importantly, aRBD-2-5-Fc provided in vivo prophylactic protection for mice against WT and mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, and provided full protection against Omicron in hamster model when administrated either prophylactically or therapeutically. Taken together, we found a conserved epitope on RBD, and hetero-bivalent nanobodies had increased affinity for VOCs over its monovalent form, and provided potent and broad-spectrum protection both in vitro and in vivo against all tested major variants, and potentially future emerging variants. Our strategy provides a new solution in the development of therapeutic antibodies for COVID-19 caused by newly emergent VOCs.",

    "abstract": "Enterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of hospital-acquired infections. These infections are becoming more difficult to treat due to the increasing emergence of E. faecalis strains resistant to last resort antibiotics. Over the past decade, multiple groups have engineered the naturally occurring bacterial defense system CRISPR-Cas as a sequence-specific antimicrobial to combat antibiotic-resistant bacteria. We have previously established that the type II CRISPR-Cas system of E. faecalis can be reprogrammed as a CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial and delivered to antibiotic-resistant recipients on a conjugative pheromone-responsive plasmid. Using a co-culture system, we showed sequence-specific depletion of antibiotic resistance from E. faecalis model strains, both in vitro and in vivo. Although this and other studies have demonstrated the potential use for CRISPR-Cas as an antimicrobial, most have deployed the system against model bacterial strains. Thus, there is limited knowledge on how effective these potential therapies are against recently isolated and uncharacterized strains with limited laboratory passage, which we refer to here as wild strains. Here, we compare the efficacy of our previously established CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials against both E. faecalis model strains and wild E. faecalis fecal isolates. We demonstrate that these wild isolates can antagonize the CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial donor strain via competitive factors like cytolysin. Furthermore, we show that the wild isolates can effectively prevent delivery of the CRISPR-Cas antimicrobial plasmids, consequently avoiding CRISPR-Cas targeting. Our results emphasize the requisite to study CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials against wild strains to understand limitations and develop delivery systems that can endure competitive interspecies interactions in the gut microenvironment and effectively deliver CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials to their intended targets.\n\nIMPORTANCEEnterococcus faecalis is a major nosocomial pathogen. Traditional antibiotics continue to lose potency against these opportunistic pathogens as they become increasingly resistant to more antibiotics. We previously showed that our CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials can deplete drug resistance in or kill E. faecalis model strains. Here, we examined the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials against a recent collection of E. faecalis fecal isolates. We found that CRISPR-Cas delivery and efficacy is affected by competitive factors produced by the wild isolates. Our study emphasizes the need to study CRISPR-Cas antimicrobials in the context of wild bacterial isolates, which are the intended target for this potential therapy, in order to understand limitations and develop CRISPR-enhanced antimicrobials with effective clinical applications.",

    "abstract": "The currently dominant variant of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, carrying a great number of mutations, has been verified its strong capacity of immune escape in COVID-19 convalescents and vaccinated individuals. An increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 reinfection or breakthrough infection should be concerned. Here we reported higher humoral immune response elicited by Delta and Omicron variants after breaking through previous infection and cross-neutralization against VOCs, compared to the ancestral wild-type (WT) virus infection. To overcome the immune escape of Omicron, Omicron-specific vaccine was considered as a novel and potential strategy. Mouse models were used to verify whether Omicron-specific RBD subunit boost immune response by immunizing Omicron-RBD recombinant proteins. Three doses of Omicron-RBD immunization elicit comparable neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers with three doses of WT-RBD immunization, but the neutralizing activity was not cross-active. By contrast, two doses of WT-RBD with an Omicron-RBD booster increased the NAb geometric mean titers against Omicron by 9 folds. Moreover, an additional boost vaccination with Omicron-RBD protein could increase humoral immune response against both WT and current VOCs. These results suggest that the Omicron-specific subunit booster shows its advantages in the immune protection from both WT and current VOCs, and that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines administration using two or more virus lineages as antigens might improve the NAb response.",

    "abstract": "The social amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is a model for a wide range of biological processes including chemotaxis, cell-cell communication, phagocytosis, and development. Interrogating these processes with modern genetic tools often requires the expression of multiple transgenes. While it is possible to transfect multiple transcriptional units, the use of separate promoters and terminators for each gene leads to large plasmid sizes and possible interference between units. In other eukaryotic systems this challenge has been addressed through polycistronic expression mediated by 2A viral peptides, permitting efficient, co-regulated gene expression. Here, we screen the most commonly used 2A peptides, porcine teschovirus-1 2A (P2A), Thosea asigna virus 2A (T2A), equine rhinitis A virus 2A (E2A), and foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A (F2A), for activity in D. discoideum. We find that these 2A sequences are effective but that, unexpectedly, combining the coding sequences of two proteins into a single transcript leads to notable decreases in expression level with strain-dependent magnitudes, suggesting unexplored constraints of gene expression in D. discoideum that merit further investigation. Our results show that P2A is the optimal sequence for polycistronic expression, opening up new possibilities for genetic engineering in this model system.",

Here, we report the translocation of sod1 to the cell nucleus in primary co-cultures of neurons and astrocytes derived from newborn rats explants even in the absence of oxidative stress stimuli. The successful tissue explants from rats allowed simplistic and clean modeling of Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-simile tissue microenvironment. This mixed-cells-population was responsive to H2O2 (100 M) oxidative stress with a progressive dying process up to 6 h after stimuli. However, no differences in SOD1 nucleus translocation were observed in rat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-simile tissue microenvironment up to 6 hours under oxidative stress. These results altogether point to a robust cellular collaboration between neurons and astrocytes so that the tissue can equilibrate this SOD1 translocation during the oxidative stress response and in the early animal development.",

    "abstract": "Gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptors, the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in the mammalian central nervous system, inhibit neuronal firing to preserve balanced neuronal activity. Maintenance of GABAA receptor protein homeostasis (proteostasis) in the cell utilizing its interacting proteins is essential for the function of GABAA receptors. However, how the proteostasis network orchestrates GABAA receptor biogenesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is not well understood. To address this question systematically, we employed a proteomics-based approach to identify the interactomes of GABAA receptors by carrying out a quantitative immunoprecipitation-tandem mass spectrometry (IP-MS/MS) analysis utilizing stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC). To enhance the coverage and reliability of the identified proteins, we performed comparative proteomics by using both wild type 1 subunit and a misfolding-prone 1 subunit carrying the A322D variant as the bait proteins. The wild type 1 interactome contains 125 proteins, the 1(A322D) interactome contains 105 proteins, and 54 proteins overlap within two interactomes. Bioinformatics analysis identified potential GABAA receptor proteostasis network components, including chaperones, folding enzymes, trafficking factors, and degradation factors. Further, their potential involvement is modelled in the cellular folding, degradation and trafficking pathways for GABAA receptors. In addition, we verified endogenous interactions between 1 subunit and their selected interactors by carrying out co-immunoprecipitation assay in mouse brain homogenates. This study paves the way for understanding the molecular mechanisms as well as fine-tuning of GABAA receptor proteostasis to ameliorate related neurological diseases such as epilepsy.",

It is likely that it compacts DNA via an ATP hydrolysis-dependent, DNA loop-extrusion reaction as has been demonstrated for the yeast SMC proteins condensin and cohesin. MukB also interacts with the ParC subunit of the cellular chromosomal decatenase topoisomerase IV, an interaction that is required for proper chromosome condensation and segregation in E. coli, although it suppresses the MukB ATPase activity. We have investigated the MukBEF ATPase activity, identifying inter- and intra-subunit interactions by protein-protein crosslinking and site-specific mutagenesis. We show that interactions between the hinge of MukB and its neck region are essential for the ATPase activity, that the ParC subunit of Topo IV inhibits the MukB ATPase by preventing this interaction, that MukE interaction with DNA is likely essential for viability, and that interactions between MukF and the MukB neck region are necessary for ATPase activity and viability.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium from passerines have caused wild bird mortality and human salmonellosis outbreaks in Europe, Oceania, and North America. Here, we performed comparative genomic analysis to explore the emergence, genetic relationship, and evolution of geographically dispersed passerine isolates. We found that passerine isolates from Europe and the United States clustered to form two lineages (EU and US passerine lineages), which were distinct from major S. Typhimurium lineages circulating in other diverse hosts (e.g., humans, cattle, pigs, chicken, other avian hosts such as pigeons and ducks). Further, passerine isolates from New Zealand clustered to form a sublineage (NZ passerine lineage) of the US passerine lineage. We inferred that the passerine isolates mutated at a rate of 3.2 x 10-7 substitutions/site/year, and the US, EU, and NZ passerine lineages emerged in ca. 1952, 1970, and 1996, respectively. Isolates from the three lineages presented genetic similarity such as lack of antimicrobial resistance genes and accumulation of same virulence pseudogenes. In addition, genetic diversity due to microevolution existed in the three passerine lineages. Specifically, pseudogenization in type 1 fimbrial gene fimC (deletion of G at position 87) was only detected in the US and NZ passerine isolates, while a single-base deletion in type 3 secretion system effector genes (i.e., gogB, sseJ, and sseK2) solely concurred in the EU passerine isolates. These findings provide insights into evolution, host adaptation, and epidemiology of S. Typhimurium in passerines.\n\nIMPORTANCEPasserine-associated S. Typhimurium have been linked to human salmonellosis outbreaks in recent years. Here we investigated the phylogenetic relationship of globally distributed passerine isolates and profiled their genomic similarity and diversity. Our study reveals two passerine-associated S. Typhimurium lineages circulating in Europe, Oceania, and North America. Isolates from the two lineages presented phylogenetic and genetic signatures that were distinct from isolates of other hosts. The findings shed light on host adaptation of S. Typhimurium in passerines and are important for source attribution of S. Typhimurium to avian hosts. Further, we found S. Typhimurium definitive phage type (DT) 160 from passerines that caused decade-long human salmonellosis outbreaks in New Zealand and Australia formed a sublineage of the US passerine lineage, suggesting that DT160 may have originated from passerines outside Oceania.

A cis-antisense RNA, StfZ, produced from the ftsA-ftsZ intergenic region was proposed to regulate the FtsZ level in Escherichia coli. However, its structural identity remained unknown. In the present study, we determined the complete sequence, identified the promoters, and effects of StfZ on the FtsZ level. We show that StfZ is expressed at 1:6 ratio of StfZ:ftsZ mRNA at all growth phases from three promoters as three isoforms of 366 nt, 474 nt, and 552 nt. Overexpression of StfZ reduces FtsZ level, increases cell size, and blocks cell division.

To evaluate the effects of practically adopted restricted feeding during gestation on blood glucose level and fecal microbiota composition, 31 sows were used to identify the shifts in bacterial assemblages by 16S rRNA sequencing in their early pregnancy, late pregnancy and late lactation stages. We find that the blood glucose was elevated significantly (p < 0.001) in sows offered abundant feed in the late lactation as compared with those of the same cohort in the pregnancy stages when on limited feed. Five bacterial genera were differentially abundant among three stages, and the abundances of Streptococcus (padj < 0.001) and unclassified_f_Lachnospiraceae (padj < 0.001) were increased, whereas the abundances of Lactobacillus (padj = 0.035) and Escherichia-Shigella (padj< 0.001) were decreased in the latter two stages. The genus Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group (padj = 0.026) displayed higher abundance in the late lactation stage. A significant correlation in the Pearsons analysis indicates that three out of these five differentially abundant genera were related to blood glucose change.

Here we show that Schwann cells (SCs) activated by cancer cells collectively function as Tumor Activated Schwann cell Tracks (TASTs) that promote cancer cell migration and invasion. Non-myelinating SCs form TASTs and have cell gene expression signatures that correlate with diminished survival in patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In TASTs, dynamic SCs form tracks that serve as cancer pathways and apply forces on cancer cells to enhance cancer motility. These SCs are activated by c-Jun, analogous to their reprogramming during nerve repair. This study reveals a mechanism of cancer cell invasion that co-opts a wound repair process and exploits the ability of SCs to collectively organize into tracks. These findings establish a novel paradigm of how cancer cells spread and reveal therapeutic opportunities.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHow the tumor microenvironment participates in pancreatic cancer progression is not fully understood.

    "abstract": "The acquisition of novel detrimental cellular properties following exposure to cytotoxic drugs leads to aggressive and metastatic tumors that often translates into an incurable disease. While the bulk of the primary tumor is eliminated upon exposure to chemotherapeutic treatment, residual cancer cells and non-transformed cells within the host can engage a stable cell cycle exit program named senescence. Senescent cells secrete a distinct set of pro-inflammatory factors, collectively termed the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). Upon exposure to the SASP, cancer cells undergo cellular plasticity resulting in increased proliferation, migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. The molecular mechanisms by which the SASP regulates these pro-tumorigenic features are poorly understood. Here, we report that breast cancer cells exposed to the SASP strongly upregulate Lipocalin 2 (LCN2). Furthermore, we demonstrate that LCN2 is critical for SASP-induced increased migration in breast cancer cells, and its inactivation potentiates the response to chemotherapeutic treatment in mouse models of breast cancer. Finally, we show that neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment leads to LCN2 upregulation in residual human breast tumors, and correlates with worse overall survival. These findings provide the foundation for targeting LCN2 as an adjuvant therapeutic approach to prevent the emergence of aggressive tumors following chemotherapy.",

It is unclear whether the mitochondrial function in regulatory T cells (Tregs) determines effector T cell fate decisions and regulates steady-state inflammation. We show that loss of Mitochondrial Transcription Factor A in Foxp3+ Tregs (TFAM cKO) affects the cellular and transcriptional dynamics of CD4+ T cells, resulting in disproportional cellular heterogeneity and prevalence of pathogenic CD4+ T cell subsets. Failure to modulate CD4+ T cell responses results in systemic inflammation, immunological aging, and shortened lifespans in TFAM cKO mice. Furthermore, we found that TFAM heterozygous (Het) mice with 50% allelic restoration had a progressive decrease in physiological, cognitive, and neuromuscular activity starting at 8 months, implying that the TFAM Het mouse model has the potential to be used for in-depth research on age-related inflammatory diseases. Overall, TFAM depletion in Tregs explains the steady-state reduction in Treg function with age. TFAM restoration in Tregs could be a target for preserving the homeostatic CD4+ T cell pool and avoiding cognitive impairments caused by inflammation induced aging (inflammaging).",

    "abstract": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a form of acute lung injury which leads to a paucity of oxygen. To remedy ARDS, patients are put on mechanical ventilators; however, the stretch resulting from the mechanical ventilator can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury or VILI. VILI is exacerbated by age. The combined effects of ARDS and mechanical ventilation can result in a hostile environment which may lead to senescence (stable cell cycle arrest). The role of senescence in VILI is poorly understood. Senescence is characterized by increased cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors P16 and P21; however, P21 has been shown to occur in early senescence. We hypothesized that mechanical ventilation would lead to DNA damage and senescence-like phenotype. Both in vivo and in vitro models of VILI were used to investigate senescence and its mechanism in VILI. Mechanical ventilation increased senescence-associated markers such as DNA damage marker characterized by {gamma}H2AX, P21, senescence-associated secretory phenotype IL6, and decreased proliferation. Moreover, mechanical ventilation led to increased apoptosis. Lung sections were stained for KRT8 proteins, markers of transiently differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells which were reported to be more prone to DNA damage. Age and mechanical ventilation increased KRT8 positive cells. Finally, we probed a potential mediator of the stretch induced senescence in vitro by inhibiting P38-MAPK, which can be activated by DNA damage response, leading to increased P21. Inhibiting P38 decreased in P21 but did not decrease {gamma}H2AXThese findings suggest that mechanical ventilation may lead to a senescence-like phenotype involving the P38-MAPK pathway.",

We uncovered acute roles for STAT3 and its target, TFCP2L1, in maintenance of epiblast and primitive endoderm during in vivo diapause. On an outbred genetic background, we observed consistent developmental retardation from implantation until embryonic day 11.5, beginning with significant reduction of epiblast cells at implantation in Stat3 null embryos. Remarkably, mutants closely resemble non-affected embryos from the previous day at all postimplantation stages examined. We attribute this phenotype to loss of the active serine phosphorylated form of STAT3 required for neural differentiation and implicated in growth defects in mice and humans. Bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of isolated epiblasts revealed compromised lipid metabolism in Stat3 null embryos by embryonic day 6.5. Furthermore, we demonstrate that gastruloids generated from Stat3 null ESCs failed to extend the posterior axis or maintain BRACHYURY expression and were underrepresented in this region when mixed with wild type cells in chimaeric gastruloids.

    "abstract": "Gene drives are genetic constructs that can spread deleterious alleles with potential application to population suppression of harmful species. Given that a gene drive can potentially spill over to other populations or even other species, control measures and fail-safes strategies must be considered. Gene drives are designed to generate a rapid demographic decline, while at the same time generating a dynamic change in the populations genetics. Since these evolutionary and demographic processes are linked and are expected to occur at a similar time-scale during gene drive spread, feedback between these processes may significantly affect the outcome of deployment. To study this feedback and to understand how it affects gene drive spillovers, we developed a gene drive model that combines evolutionary and demographic dynamics in a two-population setting. The model demonstrates how feedback between evolutionary and demographic dynamics can generate additional outcomes to those generated by the evolutionary dynamics alone. We identify an outcome of particular interest, where the short-term suppression of the target population is followed by gene swamping and loss of the gene drive. This outcome could be useful for designing gene drive deployments that temporarily suppress the population, but ultimately do not remain in the population. Using our model, we demonstrate the robustness of this outcome to spillover and to the evolution of resistance, and suggest that it could be used as a fail-safe strategy for gene drive deployment.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold2 has revolutionized protein structure prediction by leveraging sequence information to rapidly model protein folds with atomic-level accuracy. Nevertheless, previous work has shown that these predictions tend to be inaccurate for structurally heterogeneous proteins. To systematically assess factors that contribute to this inaccuracy, we tested AlphaFold2s performance on 98 fold-switching proteins, which assume at least two distinct-yet-stable secondary and tertiary structures. Topological similarities were quantified between five predicted and two experimentally determined structures of each fold-switching protein. Overall, 94% of AlphaFold2 predictions captured one experimentally determined conformation but not the other. Despite these biased results, AlphaFold2s estimated confidences were moderate-to-high for 74% of fold-switching residues, a result that contrasts with overall low confidences for intrinsically disordered proteins, which are also structurally heterogeneous. To investigate factors contributing to this disparity, we quantified sequence variation within the multiple sequence alignments used to generate AlphaFold2s predictions of fold-switching and intrinsically disordered proteins. Unlike intrinsically disordered regions, whose sequence alignments show low conservation, fold-switching regions had conservation rates statistically similar to canonical single-fold proteins. Furthermore, intrinsically disordered regions had systematically lower prediction confidences than either fold-switching or single-fold proteins, regardless of sequence conservation. AlphaFold2s high prediction confidences for one fold-switching conformation corroborate previous work showing that machine-learning-based structure predictors fail to capture other fundamental biophysical features of proteins such as their folding pathways. Our results emphasize the need to look at protein structure as an ensemble and suggest that systematic examination of fold-switching sequences may reveal propensities for multiple stable secondary and tertiary structures.",

    "abstract": "The redox regulator NRF2 is hyperactivated in a large percentage of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases, which is associated with chemotherapy and radiation resistance. To identify redox vulnerabilities for KEAP1/NRF2 mutant NSCLC, we conducted a CRISPR-Cas9-based negative selection screen for antioxidant enzyme genes whose loss sensitized cells to sub-lethal concentrations of the superoxide (O2*-)-generating drug {beta}-Lapachone. While our screen identified expected hits in the pentose phosphate pathway, the thioredoxin-dependent antioxidant system, and glutathione reductase, we also identified the mitochondrial superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) as one of the top hits. Surprisingly, {beta}-Lapachone did not generate mitochondrial O2*- but rather SOD2 loss enhanced the efficacy of {beta}-Lapachone due to loss of iron-sulfur protein function, loss of mitochondrial ATP maintenance and deficient NADPH production. Importantly, inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport activity sensitized to {beta}-Lapachone, demonstrating these effects may be translated to increase ROS sensitivity therapeutically.",

    "abstract": "Interleukin 27 (IL-27) is a heterodimeric cytokine that functions to constrain T cell-mediated inflammation and plays an important role in immune homeostasis. Binding of IL-27 to cell surface receptors IL-27R and gp130 results in activation of receptor-associated Janus Kinases and nuclear translocation of STAT1 and STAT3 transcription factors. Despite the emerging therapeutic importance of this cytokine axis in cancer and autoimmunity, a molecular blueprint of the IL-27 receptor signaling complex, and its relation to other gp130/IL-12 family cytokines, is currently unclear. We used cryogenic-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine the quaternary structure of IL-27 (p28/Ebi3) bound to receptor subunits, IL-27R and gp130. The resulting 3.47 [A] resolution structure revealed a three-site assembly mechanism nucleated by the central p28 subunit of the cytokine. The overall topology and molecular details of this binding are reminiscent of IL-6 but distinct from related heterodimeric cytokines IL-12 and IL-23. These results indicate distinct receptor assembly mechanisms used by heterodimeric cytokines with important consequences for targeted agonism and antagonism of IL-27 signaling.",
