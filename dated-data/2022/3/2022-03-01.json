    "abstract": "MotivationMultiple sequence alignment (MSA) is a basic step in many bioinformatics pipelines. However, achieving highly accurate alignments on large datasets, especially those with sequence length heterogeneity, is a challenging task. UPP (Ultra-large multiple sequence alignment using Phylogeny-aware Profiles) is a method for MSA estimation that builds an ensemble of Hidden Markov Models (eHMM) to represent an estimated alignment on the full length sequences in the input, and then adds the remaining sequences into the alignment using selected HMMs in the ensemble. Although UPP provides good accuracy, it is computationally intensive on large datasets.\n\nResultsWe present UPP2, a direct improvement on UPP. The main advance is a fast technique for selecting HMMs in the ensemble that allows us to achieve the same accuracy as UPP but with greatly reduced runtime. We show UPP2 produces more accurate alignments compared to leading MSA methods on datasets exhibiting substantial sequence length heterogeneity, and is among the most accurate otherwise.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/gillichu/sepp\n\nContactwarnow@illinois.edu",

    "abstract": "The interaction of Tween-20 with lipid membranes is crucial for a number of biotechnological applications including viral inactivation and membrane protein extraction, but the underlying mechanistic details have remained elusive. Evidence from ensemble assays supports a global model of Tween-20 induced membrane disruption that broadly encompasses association of the surfactant with the membrane surface, membrane fragmentation and the release of mixed micelles to solution, but whether this process involves intermediate and dynamic transitions between regimes is an open question. In search of the mechanistic origins of membrane disruption, increasing focus is put on identifying Tween-20 interactions with highly controllable model membranes. In light of this, and to unveil quantitative mechanistic details, we employed highly interdisciplinary biophysical approaches, including quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring, steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence and FRET spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, wide-field single-vesicle imaging and scanning electron microscopy, to interrogate the interactions between Tween-20 and both freely-diffusing and surface-immobilized model-membrane vesicles. Using ultrasensitive sensing approaches, we discovered that Tween-20 leads to a stepwise and phase-dependent structural remodelling of sub-micron sized vesicles that includes permeabilization and swelling, even at detergent concentrations below the critical micellar concentration. These insights into the structural perturbation of lipid vesicles upon Tween-20 interaction highlight the impact on vesicle conformation prior to complete solubilization, and the tools presented may have general relevance for probing the interaction between lipid vesicles and a wide variety of disruptive agents.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are generated at centrosomes, chromosomes, and within spindles during cell division. Whereas microtubule nucleation at the centrosome is well characterized, much remains unknown about where, when, and how microtubules are nucleated at chromosomes. To address these questions, we reconstituted microtubule nucleation from purified chromosomes in meiotic Xenopus egg extract and found that chromosomes alone can form spindles. We visualized microtubule nucleation at chromosomes using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to find that this occurs through branching microtubule nucleation. The initial branches nucleate near and towards kinetochores, helping explain how kinetochores might be efficiently captured. By depleting molecular motors, we find that the organization of the resultant polar branched networks is consistent with a theoretical model where the effectors for branching nucleation are released by chromosomes, forming a concentration gradient around them that spatially biases branching nucleation. In the presence of motors, these branched networks are organized into multipolar spindles.",

    "abstract": "In fluorescence microscopy, scientific-grade laser diodes are key components and contribute a considerable expense to the total cost of the microscope setup. Existing open-source laser excitation modules are mainly designed for super-resolution imaging and have not been fully characterised to meet the requirements of single-molecule spectroscopy measurements. In this paper we introduce an open-source, cost-efficient excitation module that can be used for confocal, accurate single-molecule FRET, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and low-power super-resolution techniques. The module delivers two diode lasers (520 nm and 638 nm) via a single-mode fibre, with stable power output (<1% deviation), which can be modulated on the microsecond timescale. Here, we benchmark these lasers against smFRET standards, and recover consistent diffusion coefficients from FCS measurements, thereby demonstrating their suitability for a range of single-molecule spectroscopic experiments, whilst reducing the overall costs of our open-source smFRET instrument (the smfBox) by ~50%, making these types of experiments even more accessible to the widest possible userbase.",

Pengze) was employed in this work as the research object treated by a single oral administration of the antibiotic. Results showed that ENR residues could be detected in brain of crucian carp exposed to both half lethal dose (LD50) and safe dose (SD) of ENR throughout the trial period, indicating that ENR had an ability of permeating the BBB of crucian carp. Evans blue (EB) dispersively distributed in brain tissue of fish exposed to SD ENR, but not in the vehicle-treated fish brain, which suggested structural failure of BBB by ENR. Expression levels of BBB-related molecules, occludin and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), were significantly down-regulated by ENR. Brain injury markers, NSE, S100B and GFAP were improved that were demonstrated by elevated contents of proteins in brain and serum. According to the data of correlation analysis, it was observed that ENR residue was closely related to S100B and GFAP, indicating that S100B and GFAP could be used as evaluation indicators for brain injury of crucian carp. All findings mentioned above suggest that ENR may cause structural change of BBB, resulting in biological brain damage in crucian carp.",

    "abstract": "Protein engineering approaches have been proposed to improve the inhibitory properties of plant cystatins towards herbivorous pest digestive Cys proteases, typically involving sequence alterations in the inhibitory loops and/or N-terminal trunk of the protein interacting with specific amino acid residues of the target protease. In this study, we assessed whether the loops-supporting frame, or scaffold, would represent a valuable structural module for cystatin function improvement. Twenty hybrid cystatins were designed in silico, consisting of the N-terminal trunk and two inhibitory loops of a given donor cystatin grafted onto the scaffold of an alternative, recipient cystatin. Synthetic genes for the hybrids were expressed in E. coli, and the resulting proteins assessed for their potency to inhibit model Cys protease papain and the digestive Cys proteases of Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata) used as an insect pest model. In line with the occurrence of positively selected amino acids presumably influencing inhibitory activity in the scaffold region of plant cystatins, grafting the N-terminal trunk and inhibitory loops of a given cystatin onto the scaffold of an alternative cystatin generally had an effect on the inhibitory potency of these function-related elements against Cys proteases. For instance, hybrid cystatins including the three structural elements of model tomato cystatin SlCYS8 grafted on the scaffold of cystatins from other plant families showed Ki values altered by up to 3-fold for papain, and inhibitory efficiencies increased by up to 8-fold against L. decemlineata cathepsin L-like proteases, compared to wild-type SlCYS8 bearing the original scaffold. Our data point to a significant influence of the cystatin scaffold on the inhibitory activity of the N-terminal trunk and protease inhibitory loops. They also suggest the potential of this structural element as a module for plant cystatin design to generate functional variability against Cys proteases, including the digestive proteases of herbivorous pests.",

    "abstract": "The timing of diverse cellular processes is based on the instant when the concentration of regulatory proteins crosses a critical threshold level. Hence, noise mechanisms inherent to these protein synthesis pathways drive statistical fluctuations in such events timing. How to express proteins ensuring both the threshold crossing at a prescribed time and minimal timing fluctuations? To find this optimal strategy, we formulate a model where protein molecules are synthesized in random bursts of gene activity. The burst frequency depends on the protein level creating a feedback loop, and cellular growth dilutes protein concentration between consecutive bursts. Counterintuitively, our analysis shows that positive feedback in protein production is best for minimizing variability in threshold-crossing times. We analytically predict the optimal feedback strength in terms of the dilution rate. As a corollary to our result, a no-feedback strategy emerges as the optimal strategy in the absence of dilution. We further consider other noise sources, such as randomness in either the initial condition or the threshold level, and find that in many cases, we need either strongly negative or positive feedback for precise scheduling for events.",

    "abstract": "Protein aggregation is a hallmark of age-related neurodegeneration. Yet, aggregation during normal aging and in tissues other than the brain is poorly understood. Here we leverage the African turquoise killifish to systematically profile protein aggregates in seven tissues of an aging vertebrate. Age-dependent aggregation is strikingly tissue-specific, and not simply driven by protein expression differences. Experimental interrogation, combined with machine learning, indicates that this specificity is linked to both protein-autonomous biophysical features and tissue-selective alterations in protein quality control. Co-aggregation of protein quality control machinery during aging may further reduce proteostasis capacity, exacerbating aggregate burden. A segmental progeria model with accelerated aging in specific tissues exhibits selectively increased aggregation in these same tissues. Intriguingly, many age-related protein aggregates arise in wild-type proteins that, when mutated, drive human diseases. Our data chart a comprehensive landscape of protein aggregation during aging and reveal strong, tissue-specific associations with dysfunction and disease.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LITissue-specific protein aggregation is prevalent during vertebrate aging\nC_LIO_LIBoth protein biophysical properties and tissue-specific protein homeostasis patterns impact aggregation\nC_LIO_LIA segmental progeria model with accelerated aging exhibits selectively increased protein aggregation in affected tissues\nC_LIO_LIMany aggregates that accumulate during physiological aging are linked to disease\nC_LI",

Thus, we have characterized human prenatal cardiomyocytes, 6.5- 7 weeks post-conception, in detail by integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, spatial transcriptomics, and ligand-receptor interaction information. Using a computational workflow developed to dissect cell type heterogeneity, localize cell types, and explore their molecular interactions, we identified eight types of developing cardiomyocyte, more than double compared to the ones identified in the Human Developmental Cell Atlas. These have high variability in cell cycle activity, mitochondrial content, and connexin gene expression, and are differentially distributed in the ventricles, including outflow tract, and atria, including sinoatrial node. Moreover, cardiomyocyte ligand-receptor crosstalk is mainly with non-cardiomyocyte cell types, encompassing cardiogenesis-related pathways. Thus, early prenatal human cardiomyocytes are highly heterogeneous and develop unique location-dependent properties, with complex ligand-receptor crosstalk. Further elucidation of their developmental dynamics may give rise to new therapies.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=194 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482029v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (76K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1385cb8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f62d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e0b10borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1876345_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In healthy axons, the axon survival factor NMNAT2 inhibits SARM1, the central executioner of programmed axon degeneration.

The polymorphisms result in amino acid substitutions, V98M and R232Q, which reduce NMNAT2 NAD+-synthetase activity. We generated a mouse model of the human syndrome and found that Nmnat2V98M/Nmnat2R232Q compound-heterozygous CRISPR mice survive to adulthood but develop progressive motor dysfunction, peripheral axon loss, and macrophage infiltration. These disease phenotypes are all SARM1-dependent. Remarkably, macrophage depletion therapy blocks and reverses neuropathic phenotypes in Nmnat2V98M/R232Q mice, identifying a SARM1-dependent neuroimmune mechanism as a key driver of disease pathogenesis. These findings demonstrate that SARM1 induces an inflammatory neuropathy and highlight the potential of immune therapy to treat this rare syndrome and other neurodegenerative conditions associated with NMNAT2 loss and SARM1 activation.",

    "abstract": "Establishing and maintaining tolerance to self- or innocuous foreign antigens is vital for preservation of organismal health. Within the thymus, medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) expressing AutoImmune Regulator, Aire, play a critical role in self-tolerance through deletion of autoreactive T cells and promotion of thymic regulatory T (Treg) cell development. Within weeks of birth, a separate wave of Treg cell differentiation occurs in the periphery, upon exposure to dietary and commensal microbiota derived antigens, yet the cell types responsible for the generation of peripheral Treg (pTreg) cells are not known. Here we identified a new class of ROR{gamma}t+ antigen-presenting cells (APC), dubbed Thetis cells (TCs), with transcriptional features of both mTECs and dendritic cells (DCs), comprising 4 major sub-groups (TC I-IV). We uncovered a developmental wave of TCs within intestinal lymph nodes during a critical early life window, coincident with the wave of pTreg cell differentiation. While TC I and III expressed the signature mTEC nuclear factor Aire, TC IV lacked Aire expression and were enriched for molecules required for pTreg generation, including the TGF-{beta} activating integrin v{beta}8. Loss of either MHCII or Itgb8 expression by TCs led to a profound impairment in intestinal pTreg differentiation, with onset of intestinal inflammation. In contrast, MHCII expression by ROR{gamma}t+ group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3) and classical DCs was neither sufficient nor required for pTreg generation, further implicating TCs as the tolerogenic ROR{gamma}t+ APC with an essential early life function. Our studies reveal parallel pathways for establishment of tolerance to self and foreign antigen within the thymus and periphery, marked by involvement of shared cellular and transcriptional programs.",

    "abstract": "Cellular metabolism is a critical regulator of macrophage effector function. Tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (TR-AMs) inhabit a unique niche marked by high oxygen and low glucose. We have recently shown that in contrast to bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), TR-AMs cannot utilize glycolysis and predominantly rely on mitochondrial function for their effector response. It is not known how changes in local oxygen concentration that occur during conditions such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) might affect TR-AM metabolism and function; however, ARDS is associated with progressive loss of TR-AMs, which correlates with the severity of disease and mortality. Here, we demonstrate that hypoxia robustly stabilizes HIF-1 in TR-AMs to promote a glycolytic phenotype. Hypoxia altered TR-AM metabolite signatures, cytokine production, and decreased their sensitivity to the inhibition of mitochondrial function. By contrast, hypoxia had minimal effects on BMDM metabolism. The effects of hypoxia on TR-AMs were mimicked by FG-4592, a HIF-1 stabilizer. Treatment with FG-4592 decreased TR-AM death and attenuated acute lung injury in mice. These findings reveal the importance of microenvironment in determining macrophage metabolic phenotype, and highlight the therapeutic potential in targeting cellular metabolism to improve outcomes in diseases characterized by acute inflammation.",

    "abstract": "Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) is one of the three main apical kinases at the crux of DNA damage response and repair in mammalian cells. ATM activates a cascade of downstream effector proteins to regulate DNA repair and cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA double-strand breaks. While ATM is predominantly known for its role in DNA damage response and repair, new roles of ATM have recently begun to emerge, such as in regulating oxidative stress or metabolic pathways. Here, we report the surprising discovery that ATM inhibition and deletion lead to reduced expression of the nuclear envelope protein lamin A. Lamins are nuclear intermediate filaments that modulate nuclear shape, structure, and stiffness. Accordingly, inhibition or deletion of ATM resulted in increased nuclear deformability and enhanced cell migration through confined spaces, which requires substantial nuclear deformation. These findings point to a novel connection between ATM and lamin A and may have broad implications for cells with ATM mutations--as found in patients suffering from Ataxia Telangiectasia and many human cancers--which could lead to enhanced cell migration and increased metastatic potential.",

    "abstract": "Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) frequently become aneuploid with abnormal chromosome numbers due to mitotic chromosome segregation errors during propagation in culture. Yet, we do not understand why hPSCs exhibit a low mitotic fidelity. Here we investigate the mechanisms responsible for mitotic errors in hPSCs and show that the primary cause is lagging chromosomes with improper merotelic chromosome microtubule attachments in anaphase. Accordingly, we can improve merotelic error correction and reduce lagging chromosome rates in hPSCs using small molecules that prolong mitotic duration or destabilize chromosome microtubule attachments providing chemical strategies to preserve genome stability. Strikingly, we also demonstrate that mitotic error rates correlate with developmental potential decreasing upon differentiation and loss of pluripotency and conversely increasing after reprogramming to a pluripotent state. Thus, chromosome segregation fidelity is inherently low in hPSCs and depends on developmental state in normal human cells.",

    "abstract": "Mitogens capable of promoting cardiomyocyte proliferation represent important targets for functional heart regeneration following myocardial infarction. We previously described an ERK-dependent pro-proliferative tissue phenotype following overexpression of constitutively-active (ca) human ERBB2 in both neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) and human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). Since ERBB2 canonically regulates multiple other pathways in addition to ERK, it is unclear whether ERK activation alone can drive CM proliferation. Here, we activated ERK in a targeted fashion by CM-specific lentiviral expression of a constitutively active mutant of BRAF, BRAF-V600E (caBRAF), in cultured NRVMs and examined the effects on engineered NRVM tissue proliferation, morphology, and function. caBRAF expression induced ERK activation, tissue growth, loss of contractile function, and increased tissue stiffness, all of which were sustained for at least 4 weeks in vitro. From bulk RNA-sequencing analysis of engineered tissues, we found that caBRAF had broad transcriptomic effects on CMs and induced a shift to glycolytic metabolism. Together, this work shows that direct ERK activation is sufficient to modulate CM cycling and functional maturation in a cell-autonomous fashion and could offer a potential target for cardiac regenerative therapies.",

We generated 14 cell lines that were propagated for several months. We selected four morphologically distinct lines, XTN-6, XTN-8, XTN-10, and XTN-12 for further characterization. Karyotype analysis revealed that three of the lines, XTN-8, XTN-10, and XTN-12 were primarily diploid. XTN-6 cultures showed a consistent mixed population of diploid cells, cells with chromosome 8 trisomy, and cells containing a tetraploid content of chromosomes. The lines were propagated using conventional culture methods as adherent cultures at 30{degrees}C in a simple, diluted L-15 medium containing fetal bovine serum without use of a high CO2 incubator.

    "abstract": "In all vertebrates, the function of the thyroid gland is to capture iodide to synthesize hormones that act on almost all tissues and are essential for normal growth and metabolism. Thyroid hormone production is a multistep process that ultimately leads to the coupling of iodine to thyroglobulin, the matrix glycoprotein of hormone synthesis. This coupling is dependent on H2O2, the accumulation of which in thyroid tissue, a true iodine trap, causes a basal level of oxidative stress higher than in other tissues, which, if left unchecked, leads to cellular damage. The thyroid has efficient antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes that help it resist H202-induced oxidative stress and maintain the homeostasis necessary for hormone synthesis. By regulating the expression of genes involved in cellular detoxification processes, the transcription factor NRF2 acts as a master regulator of the cellular defense system against oxidative stress. Using zebrafish embryos and mouse thyroid organoids, we show here that direct control of thyroglobulin expression by NRF2 is an evolutionarily conserved chore mechanism in vertebrates to complete the necessary molecular defense arsenal against oxidative stress in thyroid tissue.",

    "abstract": "microRNAs are evolutionarily conserved non-coding RNAs that direct post-transcriptional regulation of target transcripts. We use the sea urchin embryo to achieve a comprehensive understanding of miR-1s function in a developing embryo. Results indicate that miR-1 regulates gut contractions, specification, and positioning of serotonergic neurons, as well as mesodermally-derived muscles, pigment cells, and skeletogenic cells. Gain-of-function of miR-1 generally leads to more severe developmental defects than its loss-of-function. We identified that miR-1 directly suppresses Ets1/2, Tbr, and VegfR7 of the skeletogenic gene regulatory network, and Notch, Nodal, and Wnt1 signaling components. We found that miR-1s direct suppression of Nodal may indirectly regulate FoxQ2 to impact serotonergic neurons. Excess miR-1 may lead to decreased Nodal and Notch that result in decreased circumpharnygeal muscle fibers and the number of pigment cells. The striking ectopic skeletal branching induced by miR-1 mimic injections may be explained by miR-1s direct suppression of Nodal that leads to expression changes of Vegf3, and Fgfa that mediate skeletogenesis. This work demonstrates that miR-1 plays a diverse regulatory role that impacts tissues derived from all germ layers.\n\nSummary statementThis study identifies wide-ranging regulatory roles and regulatory mechanisms of miR-1 that impact structures derived from all three germ layers during embryonic development.",

Together, both these properties affect the optimal times and sites of population censusing.\n\nWe tracked taiga bean geese (Anser fabalis fabalis) during 2014-2021 to study their migratory connectivity and non-breeding movements, and determine optimal periods to assess the size of their main flyway population. We also compared available census data with tracking data, to examine how well two existing censuses covered the population.\n\nDaily Mantels correlation between breeding and non-breeding sites lay between 0 and 0.5 during most of the non-breeding season, implying birds from different breeding areas were not strongly separated other times in the annual cycle. However, the connectivity was higher among birds from the westernmost breeding areas compared to the birds breeding elsewhere. Daily Minimum Convex Polygons showed tracked birds were highly aggregated at census times, confirming their utility. The number of tracked birds absent at count sites during the censuses however exceeded numbers double-counted at several sites, indicating that censuses might have underestimated the true population size.\n\nOur results show that connectivity can vary in different times during the non-breeding period, and should be studied throughout the annual cycle. Our results also confirm previous studies, which have found that estimates using marked individuals usually produce higher population size estimates than total counts.

    "abstract": "Flowering time is crucial for wild plant populations to adapt to their local environments. Although the genetic basis of flowering variation has been studied in many plant species, its mechanisms in non-model organisms and its adaptive value in the field are still poorly understood. Here, we report new insights into the genetic basis of flowering time and its effect on fitness in Panicum hallii, a native perennial grass. We conducted genetic mapping in populations derived from representative inland and coastal ecotypes to identify flowering time QTL and loci exhibited extensive QTL-by-environment interactions. Patterns of segregation within recombinant hybrids provide strong support for directional selection driving ecotypic divergence in flowering time. A major QTL on chromosome 5 (q-FT5) was detected in all experiments and is a key locus controlling flowering variation. Fine-mapping and expression studies identified a FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologue, FT-like 9 (PhFTL9), as the candidate underlying q-FT5. We used reciprocal transplant experiment to test for global local adaptation and the specific impact of q-FT5 on performance. We did not observe local adaptation in terms of fitness tradeoffs when contrasting ecotypes in home versus away habitats. However, we observed that the coastal allele of q-FT5 conferred a fitness advantage only in its local habitat but not at the inland site. Sequence analysis of the PhFTL9 promoter identified ecotypic specific cis-element variation associated with environmental responsiveness.

    "abstract": "Isw2 is known to bind DNA, using a Myb-type DNA binding domain and with another part of the protein interact with histones in the closest nucleosome to pull the two closest nucleosomes closer to the binding site using ATP. These bindings hinder these nucleosomes sliding movements and affect histone tail modification and DNA methylation but give more space for sliding and access for transcription factors further away from the Isw2 DNA binding sites. In a previous paper, we have knocked out the Magnaporthe oryzae Isw2 protein and complemented it with a GFP-labelled construct. We found that the MoISW2 is needed, especially in the later necrotrophic stages of infection when the plant starts defending itself.\n\nUsing published transcriptomic data, we have now found that MoISW2 is mainly co-regulated with Histone 4 (MoHIS4), which likely indicates that MoIsw2 predominately interacts with MoHis4. We performed a ChIP-seq experiment using MoIsw2-GFP to map the binding sites and investigated if MoIsw2 regulates genes by the limited sliding type mechanism and if this regulation could be involved in pathogenicity regulation. Common motifs were found in the binding DNA sequences using MEME. Interestingly, these motifs were mainly intergenic, and a dominant palindrome motif was present in 200 sequences.\n\nWe further performed an RNAseq for{Delta} Moisw2 compared with the Ku80 background strain and used genes sorted in physical order on the supercontigs to determine the effect of the mutation on the regulation of the genes physically close to the MoIsw2 binding sites. The genes close to the binding site were more absolutely regulated in the{Delta} Moisw2 mutant as expected due to the limited sliding mechaninsm. As nucleosomes are evenly distributed at roughly 200bp distance, there should be an interference pattern of regulation of genes centered around the MoIsw2 DNA binding site if the genes are roughly evenly distributed now given more space to slide due to this mechnism, which could be confirmed. We queried the NCBI database again and checked where the about 200 palindromic sequences were found in the genome to investigate if MoIsw2 binds to any known structures in the DNA. The palindromic sequences were found in conserved retrotransposon elements that generally contain palindromes. Since these retrotransposon elements can move place, they can create new regulatory variations with MoIsw2. Many avirulence genes recognized by different host plant cultivars and typically vary in expression between pathogen isolates were close to the MoIsw2 DNA binding site. That could mean that mobile elements associated with some MoIsw2 DNA binding sites are involved in creating variations in the pathogenicity of different M. oryzae strains. To test this idea, we searched through the transcriptomic data of our strain (70-15) and another strain (98-05) for variation in AVR expression during infection and if differences in MoIsw2 binding could be the cause for this variation and it seems to be that. Finally, we found that most of the genes upregulated in the{Delta} Moisw2 mutant regulate biomass growth (DNA-binding and quality control, and TFs overrepresented). In contrast, the ones downregulated have to do with mainly mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, oxidative stresses, and secondary metabolites.\n\nSimilar results for enriched and depleted genes were found for all genes in our ChIP-seq data for genes closest to MoIsw2 binding. We conclude that MoIsw2 interaction with nucleosomes and binding to palindromic DNA in transposons located between genes creates a possibility for an evolutionary fast variation of offspring regulatory pattern without loss of genes through mutation and fast creation of M.oryzae strains with new cultivar host ranges in response to defenses by resistant cultivars and consequently a fast break of resistance. MoISW2 seems to lay a mechanistic ground for natural adaptation-directed fast evolution (NADFE) of M. oryzae, which is discussed as a new concept for Eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic nematodes are major human and agricultural pests, and benzimidazoles are amongst the most important broad spectrum anthelmintic drug class used for their control. Benzimidazole resistance is now widespread in many species of parasitic nematodes in livestock globally and an emerging concern for the sustainable control of human soil transmitted helminths. {beta}-tubulin is the major benzimidazole target, although other genes may influence resistance. Among the six C. elegans {beta}-tubulin genes, loss of ben-1 causes resistance without other apparent defects. Here, we explored the genetics of C. elegans {beta}-tubulin genes in relation to the response to the benzimidazole derivative albendazole. The most highly expressed {beta}-tubulin isotypes, encoded by tbb-1 and tbb-2, were known to be redundant with each other for viability, and their products are predicted not to bind benzimidazoles. We found that tbb-2 mutants, and to a lesser extent tbb-1 mutants, were hypersensitive to albendazole. The double mutant tbb-2 ben-1 is uncoordinated and dumpy, resembling the wild type exposed to albendazole, but the tbb-1 ben-1 double mutant did not show the same phenotype. These results suggest that tbb-2 is a modifier of ABZ sensitivity. To better understand how BEN-1 mutates to cause benzimidazole resistance, we isolated mutants resistant to albendazole and found that 15 of 16 mutations occurred in ben-1. Mutations ranged from likely nulls to hypomorphs, and several corresponded to residues that cause resistance in other organisms. Null alleles of ben-1 are albendazole-resistant and BEN-1 shows high sequence identity with tubulins from other organisms, suggesting that many amino acid changes could cause resistance. However, our results suggest that missense mutations conferring resistance are not evenly distributed across all possible conserved sites. Independent of their roles in benzimidazole resistance, tbb-1 and tbb-2 may have specialized functions as null mutants of tbb-1 or tbb-2 were cold or heat sensitive, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) has gained widespread usage for taxonomically based biodiversity assessment. While interest in applying non-invasive eDNA monitoring for population genetic assessments has grown, its usage in this sphere remains limited. One barrier to uptake is that the effectiveness of eDNA detection below the species level remains to be determined for multiple species and environments. Here, we test the utility of this emergent technology in a population genetic framework using eDNA samples derived from water along New Zealands South Island (Otago Coast: n=9; Kaik[o]ura: n=7) and DNA obtained from tissue samples (n=76) of individual blackfoot p[a]ua (Haliotis iris) sampled from New Zealands Otago coast. We recovered four mitochondrial haplotypes from eDNA versus six from the tissue samples collected. Three common haplotypes were recovered with both eDNA and tissue samples, while only one out of three rare haplotypes - represented in tissue samples by one individual each - was recovered with our eDNA methods. We demonstrate that eDNA monitoring is an effective tool for recovering common genetic diversity from p[a]ua, although rare (< 5%) haplotypes are seldom recovered. Our results show the potential of eDNA to identify population-level haplotypes for gastropods in the marine environment identification below the species level and for studying the population genetic diversity of gastropods. This work supports eDNA methods as effective, non-invasive tools for genetic monitoring. Non-invasive eDNA sampling could minimize target organism stress and human interaction enabling population genetic research for hard-to-sample, delicate, or sensitive species.",

    "abstract": "Recent research on histologically healthy human tissues identified omnipresent mutational microclones, driven by somatic mutations known to be responsible for carcinogenesis (e.g., in TP53 or NOTCH1). These new insights are fundamentally changing current tumour evolution models, with broad oncological implications. Most studies are based on surgical remnant tissues, which are not available for many organs and rarely in a pan-organ setting (multiple organs from the same individual). Here, we describe an approach based on clinically annotated post-mortem tissues, derived from whole-body donors that are routinely used for educational purposes at human anatomy units. We validated this post-mortem approach using UV-exposed and unexposed epidermal skin tissues and confirm the presence of positively selected NOTCH1/2-, TP53- and FAT1-driven clones. No selection signals were detected in a set of immune genes or housekeeping genes. Additionally, we provide the first evidence for smoking-induced clonal changes in oral epithelia, likely underlying the origin of head and neck carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the whole-body donor-based approach provides a nearly unlimited healthy tissue resource to study mutational clonality and gain fundamental mutagenic insights in the presumed earliest stages of tumour evolution.",

    "abstract": "Southern Italy was characterised by a complex prehistory that started with different Palaeolithic cultures, later followed by the Neolithic transition and the demic dispersal from the Pontic-Caspian Steppe during the Bronze Age. Archaeological and historical evidence points to demic and cultural influences between Southern Italians and the Balkans, starting with the initial Palaeolithic occupation until historical and modern times. To shed light on the dynamics of these contacts, we analysed a genome-wide SNP dataset of more than 700 individuals from the South Mediterranean area (102 from Southern Italy), combined with ancient DNA from neighbouring areas. Our findings revealed high affinities of South-Eastern Italians with modern Eastern Peloponnesians, and a closer affinity of ancient Greek genomes with those from specific regions of South Italy than modern Greek genomes. The higher similarity could be associated with the presence of a Bronze Age component ultimately originating from the Caucasus and characterised by high frequencies of Iranian and Anatolian Neolithic ancestries. Furthermore, to reveal possible signals of natural selection, we looked for extremely differentiated allele frequencies among Northern and Southern Italy, uncovering putatively adapted SNPs in genes involved in alcohol metabolism, nevi features and immunological traits, such as ALDH2, NID1 and CBLB.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectiveCryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is an imaging technique that enables 3D visualization of the native cellular environment at sub-nanometer resolution, providing unpreceded insights into the molecular organization of cells. However, cryo-electron tomograms suffer from low signal-to-noise ratios and anisotropic resolution, which makes subsequent image analysis challenging. In particular, the automated detection of membrane-embedded proteins is a problem still lacking satisfactory solutions.\n\nMethodsWe present MemBrain - a new deep learning-based pipeline that automatically detects membrane-bound protein complexes in cryo-electron tomograms. After subvolumes are sampled along a segmented membrane, each subvolume is assigned a score using a convolutional neural network (CNN), and protein positions are extracted by a clustering algorithm. Incorporating rotational subvolume normalization and using a tiny receptive field simplify the task of protein detection and thus facilitate the network training.\n\nResultsMemBrain requires only a small quantity of training labels and achieves excellent performance with only a single annotated membrane (F1 score: 0.88). A detailed evaluation shows that our fully trained pipeline outperforms existing classical computer vision-based and CNN-based approaches by a large margin (F1 score: 0.92 vs. max. 0.63). Furthermore, in addition to protein center positions, MemBrain can determine protein orientations, which has not been implemented by any existing CNN-based method to date. We also show that a pre-trained MemBrain program generalizes to tomograms acquired using different cryo-ET methods and depicting different types of cells.\n\nConclusionsMemBrain is a powerful and label-efficient tool for the detection of membrane protein complexes in cryo-ET data, with the potential to be used in a wide range of biological studies. It is generalizable to various kinds of tomograms, making it possible to use pretrained models for different tasks. Its efficiency in terms of required annotations also allows rapid training and fine-tuning of models.

    "abstract": "B cell receptor (BCR) genes exposed to an antigen undergo somatic hypermutations and Darwinian antigen selection, generating a large BCR-antibody diversity. This process, known as B cell affinity maturation, increases antibody affinity, forming a specific B cell lineage that includes the unmutated ancestor and mutated variants. In a B cell lineage, cells with a higher antigen affinity will undergo clonal expansion, while those with a lower affinity will not proliferate and probably be eliminated. Therefore, cellular (genotype) abundance provides a valuable perspective on the ongoing evolutionary process. Phylogenetic tree inference is often used to reconstruct B cell lineage trees and represents the evolutionary dynamic of BCR affinity maturation. However, such methods should process B cell population data derived from experimental sampling that might contain different cellular abundances. There are a few phylogenetic methods for reconstructing the evolutionary history of B cell lineages; best-performing solutions are time-demanding and restricted to analyzing a reduced number of BCR IGH sequences, while time-efficient methods do not consider cellular abundances. We propose ClonalTree, a low-complexity and accurate approach to reconstruct B cell lineage trees that incorporates genotype abundances into minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithms. Using both simulated and experimental data, we demonstrated that ClonalTree outperforms MST-based algorithms and achieves a similar performance compared to a method that explores tree generating space exhaustively. However, ClonalTree has a lower running time, being more convenient for reconstructing phylogenetic lineage trees from high-throughput BCR sequencing data, mainly in biomedical applications, where a lower computational time is appreciable. It is hundreds to thousands of times faster than exhaustive approaches, enabling the analysis of a large set of sequences within minutes or seconds and without loss of accuracy.

Although recent studies have characterized EPN samples at both the bulk and single-cell level, intra-tumoral heterogeneity across subclones remains a confounding factor which impedes understanding of EPN biology. In this study, we generated a high-resolution single-cell dataset of pediatric ependymoma with a particular focus on the comparison of subclone differences within tumors, and show upregulation of cilium-associated genes in more highly differentiated subclone populations. As a proxy to traditional pseudotime analysis, we applied a novel trajectory scoring method to reveal cellular compositions associated with poor survival outcomes across primary and relapsed patients. Furthermore, we identified putative cell-cell communication features between relapsed and primary samples and show upregulation of pathways associated with immune cell crosstalk. Our results reveal both inter- and intratumoral gene expression profiles and tumor differentiation and provide a framework for studying transcriptomic signatures of individual subclones in ependymoma at single-cell resolution.",

    "abstract": "AS01B is a liposomal formulation of two immunostimulants namely 3-O-desacyl-4-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and QS-21. The liposomal formulation of AS01B reduces the endotoxicity of MPL and the lytic activity of QS-21; however, it renders the adjuvant sensitive to accidental slow freezing. The liposomal formulation also represents a major challenge towards the formulation of dry powders of vaccines containing AS01B. In the present study, we tested the feasibility of applying thin-film freeze-drying (TFFD) to engineer dry powders of the AS01B liposomal adjuvant alone or vaccines containing AS01B as an adjuvant. Initially, we showed that after the AS01B liposomal adjuvant was subjected to TFFD using sucrose as a stabilizer at 4% w/v, the particle size distribution of AS01B liposomes reconstituted from the dry powder was identical to the liquid adjuvant before drying. We then showed using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen adjuvanted with AS01B (AS01B/OVA) that subjecting the AS01B/OVA vaccine to TFFD and subsequent reconstitution did not negatively affect the AS01B liposome integrity, nor the immunogenicity of the vaccine. Importantly, the thin-film freeze-dried vaccine was not sensitive to repeated freezing-and-thawing. Finally, the feasibility of using TFFD to prepare dry powders of AS01B-adjuvanted vaccines was further confirmed using AS01B-adjuvanted Fluzone Quadrivalent and Shingrix, which contains AS01B. It is concluded that the TFFD technology can enable the formulation of AS01B-adjuvanted vaccines as freezing-insensitive dry powders in single-vial presentation.",

    "abstract": "Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf development and is influenced by numerous internal and environmental factors. CLE family peptides are plant-specific peptide hormones that regulate various developmental processes. However, the role of CLE in regulating leaf senescence remains unclear. Here, we found that CLE42 is a negative regulator of leaf senescence by using a CRISPR/Cas9-produced CLE mutant collection. The cle42 mutant displayed earlier senescence phenotypes, while overexpression of CLE42 delayed age-dependent and dark-induced leaf senescence. Moreover, application of the synthesized 12-aa peptide (CLE42p) also delayed leaf senescence under natural and dark conditions. CLE42 and CLE41/44 displayed functional redundancy in leaf senescence, and the cle41 cle42 cle44 triple mutant displayed more pronounced earlier senescence phenotypes than any single mutant. Analysis of differentially expressed genes obtained by RNA-Seq methodology revealed that ethylene pathway was suppressed by overexpressing CLE42. Moreover, CLE42 suppressed ethylene biosynthesis and thus promoted the protein accumulation of EBF, which in turn decreased the function of EIN3. Accordingly, mutation of EIN3/EIL1 or overexpression of EBF1 suppressed the earlier senescence phenotypes of the cle42 mutant. Together, our results reveal that the CLE peptide hormone regulates leaf senescence by communicating with ethylene pathway.",

Data are processed trial by trial: for each trial the covariance matrix of the trial is diagonalized together with that of the full data to reveal the subspace that is - locally - most eccentric relative to other trials. That subspace is then projected out from the data of that trial. This algorithm addresses a fundamental limitation of standard linear analysis methods (e.g. ICA) that assume that brain and artifact are linearly separable within the data. That assumption fails if there are more sources, including noise and brain sources, than data channels. The algorithm captitalizes on the fact that, if enough of those sources are temporally sparse, linear separation may succeed locally in time. The paper explains the rationale, describes the algorithm, and evaluates the outcome using synthetic and real brain data.",

However, whether prion-like aggregates form during normal brain aging remains unknown. Here we use quantitative proteomics in the African turquoise killifish to identify protein aggregates that accumulate in old vertebrate brains. These aggregates are enriched for prion-like RNA binding proteins, notably the ATP-dependent RNA helicase DDX5. We validate that DDX5 forms mislocalized cytoplasmic aggregates in the brains of old killifish and mice. Interestingly, DDX5s prion-like domain allows these aggregates to propagate across many generations in yeast. In vitro, DDX5 phase separates into condensates. Mutations that abolish DDX5 prion propagation also impair the proteins ability to phase separate. DDX5 condensates exhibit enhanced enzymatic activity, but they can mature into inactive, solid aggregates. Our findings suggest that protein aggregates with prion-like properties form during normal brain aging, which could have implications for the age-dependency of cognitive decline.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) dictate tissue behaviour. In epithelial tissues, laminin is both a very abundant ECM component, and a key supporting element. Here we show that laminin hinders the mechanoresponses of breast epithelial cells by shielding the nucleus from mechanical deformation. Coating substrates with laminin-111, unlike fibronectin or collagen I, impairs cell response to substrate rigidity, and YAP nuclear localization. Blocking the laminin-specific integrin {beta}4 increases nuclear YAP ratios in a rigidity dependent manner, without affecting cell forces or focal adhesions. By combining mechanical perturbations and mathematical modelling, we show that {beta}4 integrins establish a mechanical linkage between the substrate and the keratin cytoskeleton, which stiffens the network and shields the nucleus from actomyosin-mediated mechanical deformation. In turn, this affects nuclear YAP mechanoresponses and chromatin methylation. Our results demonstrate a mechanism by which tissues can regulate their sensitivity to mechanical signals.",

Here, we describe the methods we used as part of this initiative to build the first open, computer-readable, and comprehensive database of the adult human blood vasculature, called the Human Reference Atlas-Vasculature Common Coordinate Framework (HRA-VCCF). It includes 961 vessels and their branching connections, 10 cell types, and 10 biomarkers. With this paper we are releasing additional details on vessel types and subtypes, branching sequence, anastomoses, portal systems, microvasculature, functional tissue units, mappings to regions vessels supply or drain, and links to 3D reference objects. Future versions will add variants, geometric properties of vessels, and connections to the lymph vasculature; and, it will iteratively expand and improve the database as additional experimental data become available through the participating consortia.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide due to the inability of adult heart to regenerate after injury. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) methylation catalyzed by the enzyme methyltransferase-like 3 (Mettl3) plays important roles in various physiological and pathological bioprocesses. However, the role of m6A in heart regeneration remains largely unclear. To study m6A function in heart regeneration, we modulated Mettl3 expression in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown of Mettl3 significantly increased the proliferation of cardiomyocytes and accelerated heart regeneration following heart injury in neonatal and adult mice. However, Mettl3 overexpression decreased cardiomyocyte proliferation and suppressed heart regeneration in postnatal mice. Conjoint analysis of methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA-seq identified Fgf16 as a downstream target of Mettl3-mediated m6A modification during postnatal heart regeneration. RIP-qPCR and luciferase reporter assays revealed that Mettl3 negatively regulates Fgf16 mRNA expression in an m6A-Ythdf2-dependent manner. The silencing of Fgf16 suppressed the proliferation of cardiomyocytes. However, the overexpression of {Delta}Fgf16, in which the m6A consensus sequence was mutated, significantly increased cardiomyocyte proliferation and accelerated heart regeneration in postnatal mice compared with wild-type Fgf16. Our data demonstrate that Mettl3 post-transcriptionally reduces Fgf16 mRNA levels through an m6A-Ythdf2-dependen pathway, thereby controlling cardiomyocyte proliferation and heart regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Homeostatic tissue maintenance requires coordinated regulation of metabolic processes including macroautophagy/autophagy. Autophagy dysregulation underlies numerous human diseases. Our prior work revealed that the RNA binding protein IGF2BP1/IMP1 binds transcripts encoding autophagy-related proteins. Furthermore, Imp1 deletion in gastrointestinal epithelial cells in mice was associated with enhanced autophagy flux and improved recovery from tissue injury. In the current study, we evaluated molecular mechanisms underlying IMP1 modulation of autophagy. We provide a mechanism of direct IMP1 regulation of MAP1LC3B that is dependent upon IMP1 phosphorylation or cell stress, suggesting dynamic modulation of Imp1-mediated autophagy repression that facilitates tissue regeneration. More broadly, our study supports a new mechanism by which tissue regeneration is modulated post-transcriptionally via cell state rather than changes in stem or other cell lineages. This new mechanism may be particularly important in gastrointestinal epithelial cells, where autophagy is essential for tissue recovery following injury, or in diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease where defective autophagy is implicated.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a highly modular assembly of 34 distinct nucleoporins (Nups), to form a versatile transport channel between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Among them, Nup62 is known as an essential component for nuclear transport while, Nup93 for the proper nuclear envelope assembly. These Nups constitute various NPC subcomplexes: such as central transport channel (CTC), cytoplasmic ring (CR) and inner ring (IR). However, how they play their role in the NPC assembly and transport activity is not clear. Here we delineated the interacting regions, conducted biochemical reconstitution and structural characterization of the mammalian CR complex to reveal its intrinsic dynamic behaviour and a distinct  4 shaped architecture resembling the CTC complex. Our data demonstrate that Nup62 coiled-coil domain is critical to form both Nup62*Nup88 and Nup62*Nup88*Nup214 heterotrimers and both can bind to the Nup93. We therefore propose that Nup93 act as a  sensor to bind to Nup62 shared heterotrimers including Nup62*Nup54 heterotrimer of the CTC, which was not shown previously as an interacting partner. Altogether, our study establishes that the Nup62 via its coiled-coil domain is central to form compositionally distinct yet structurally similar heterotrimers, and the Nup93 anchors these diverse heterotrimers by recognizing them non-selectively.",

    "abstract": "Structural fetal diseases, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) can be diagnosed prenatally. Neonates with CDH are healthy in utero as gas exchange is managed by the placenta, but impaired lung function results in critical illness from the time a baby takes its first breath. During fetal development, lungs are capable of remarkable growth and the fetus does not yet require lung function for gas exchange. MicroRNA (miR) 200b and its downstream targets in the TGF{beta} pathway are critically involved lung branching morphogenesis. Here we characterize the expression of miR200b and the TGF{beta} pathway at different gestational times using a rat model of CDH. Fetal rats with CDH are deficient in miR200b at gestational day 18. We demonstrate that NPs loaded with miR200b given systemically to fetal rats result in changes in the TGF{beta} pathway; these epigenetic changes improve lung size, lung morphology, and lung vascularization. This is the first demonstration of in utero epigenetic therapy to improve lung growth and development in a pre-clinical model. With refinement, this technique could be applied to fetal cases of CDH or other forms of impaired lung development in a minimally invasive fashion.\n\neTOC SynopsisIn utero treatment with NPs loaded with miR200b improves lung development in a rat model of CDH. miR200b treatment epigenetic changes in the TGF{beta}, leads to larger lungs with more airspace and favorable pulmonary vascular remodeling.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482144v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3531caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@57ff5aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13d6ee9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3cb3d8_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAcinetobacter baumannii is one of the most problematic nosocomial pathogens that can efficiently thrive within hospital settings, mainly due to resistances towards antibiotics, desiccation, disinfectants, human serum and oxidative stress. Recently, increased resistance against last resort antibiotics earns this bacterium the highest priority concern classified by the CDC and the WHO. An obvious hallmark of this bacterium is the high heterogeneity observed amongst A. baumannii isolates, with a limited core genome. This feature complexifies the study of A. baumannii bacteria as an entity, subsequently reflected in a diversity of phenotypes of not only antimicrobial and environmental resistance but also virulence.\n\nMain bodyHigh degree of genome plasticity, along with the use of a limited subset of established reference strains, can lead to strain-specific observations, decreasing the global understanding of this pathogenic agent. Phenotypic variability of A. baumannii strains is easily observable such as with the macrocolony morphologies, in vitro and in vivo virulence, natural competence level, production of different capsular polysaccharide structures and cellular densities. Some strains encode an extensive amount of virulence factors while other, including the reference strains, lack several key ones. The lack/excess of genes or specific physiological processes might interfere with in vivo and in vitro experiments, thus providing limited impact on the global understanding of Acinetobacter bacteria as a whole.\n\nConclusionAs an answer to the high heterogeneity amongst A. baumannii strains, we propose a first comprehensive database that includes the bacterial strains and the associated phenotypic and genetic data. This new repository, freely accessible to the entire scientific community, allow selecting the best bacterial isolate(s) related to any biological question, using an efficient and fast exchange platform.",

    "abstract": "ATP and adenosine are key constituents of the tumor niche where they exert opposite and complementary roles. ATP promotes tumor growth but also immune eradicating responses mainly via the P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), while adenosine acts as a potent immune suppressor and facilitates neovascularization thanks to A2A receptor (A2AR) activity. However, studies exploring the interplay between P2X7R and A2AR in the tumor microenvironment are as yet missing. Here we investigated tumor growth in C57/bl6 P2X7 null mice inoculated with B16-F10 melanoma cells, showing that several pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1-{beta}, TNF-, IL-6, IL-12, IL-17, IFN-{gamma}) were significantly decreased while the immune suppressant TGF-{beta} was almost three-fold increased. Interestingly, tumors growing in P2X7-null mice also upregulated tumor-associated and splenic A2AR, suggesting that immunosuppression associated to lack of the P2X7R might depend upon A2AR overexpression. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that tumor cells A2AR expression was increased, especially around necrotic areas, and that VEGF and the endothelial marker CD31 were also upregulated. The A2AR antagonist SCH-58261 reduced tumor growth similarly in the P2X7 WT, or null mice strain. However, SCH-58261only reduced VEGF in the P2X7-KO mice, thus supporting the hypothesis of an A2AR mediated increase in vascularisation in P2X7-null host. SCH-58261 administration also significantly reduced intratumor TGF-{beta}, thus supporting a key immune suppressive role of A2AR in our model. This study shows a novel direct correlation between P2X7R and A2AR in oncogenesis and paves the way for new combined therapies promoting anti-cancer immune responses and reducing tumor vascularization.",

    "abstract": "Long-term in vitro maintenance of embryogenic lines of Pinus species has been associated with lower maturation capacity, because of this, cryopreservation protocols for the embryogenic lines are needed to maintain valuable genotypes. Since cryopreservation may induce epigenetic variations, we evaluate changes in DNA methylation levels through the course of the cryopreservation of maritime pine embryogenic lines, as compared to those lines maintained by repeated subcultures. Six maritime pine embryogenic lines were cryopreserved following a protocol that includes pre-treatments inducing osmotic stress in liquid media. The percentage of methylated cytosines (%5-mC) in total DNA was determined by using a colorimetric assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in cell lines was also determined by quantifying dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence under a confocal laser-scanning microscope. In the first experiment, we found that global DNA methylation was significantly reduced during the cryopreservation protocol. Subsequently, we evaluated the methylation status of both cryopreserved and no cryopreserved lines (maintained by subcultures) and found differences among embryogenic lines but overall, cryopreservation did not alter %5-mC of the recovered lines while periodical subcultures increased methylation rates. In addition, maltose pretreatment did not increase significantly ROS production in embryogenic lines. Our results demonstrate that the genetic stability during cryopreservation highly depends on the embryogenic line studied, but the protocol allows maintaining methylation DNA rates in most of the recovered lines.",

    "abstract": "Animals in groups integrate social information with that directly-gathered about the environment to guide decisions regarding reproduction, foraging and defense against predatory threats. In the context of predation, usage of social information has acute fitness benefits, aiding the detection of predators, the mounting of concerted defensive responses, or allowing the inference of safety, permitting other beneficial behaviors such as foraging for food. Individual and group defense responses to predatory threats can vary in modality and vigor depending on the perceived threat level. Moreover, predation level has been shown to modulate the use of social cues about foraging sites. Whether and how different threat levels affect the use of social cues to guide defense responses, is currently unknown. We previously showed that Drosophila melanogaster display a graded decrease in freezing behavior, triggered by an inescapable visual threat, with increasing group sizes. Crucially, we identified the movement of others as a cue of safety and its cessation a cue of threat and found the group responses to be primarily guided by the safety cues, resulting in a net social buffering effect. Here, we investigated how threat level impacts the use of social cues by exposing flies individually and in groups to two threat imminences using looms of different speeds. We show that freezing responses are stronger to the faster looms regardless of social condition. However, social buffering was stronger for groups exposed to the fast looms, such that the increase in freezing caused by the higher threat was less prominent in flies tested in groups than those tested individually. Through artificial control of behavior, we created different group compositions, titrating the motion cues that were maintained across threat levels. We, found that the same level of safety motion cues had a bigger weight on the flies decisions when these were exposed to the higher threat, thus overriding differences in perceived threat levels. These findings shed light on the  safety in numbers effect, revealing the modulation of the saliency of social safety cues across threat intensities, a possible mechanism to regulate costly defensive responses.",

    "abstract": "Sex differences in the structure and function of hippocampus exist. Here, we examined sex differences in contextual pattern separation, functional connectivity, and activation of new neurons during fear memory. Two-month-old male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with the DNA synthesis markers, iododeoxyuridine (IdU) and chlorodeoxyuridine (CldU) three weeks and four weeks before perfusion, respectively. One week after CldU injection, the rats underwent a context discrimination task in which rats were placed in context A (shock) and context A (no shock) every day for 12 days. On the test day, rats were placed in the shock context (context A) to measure fear memory and expression of zif268, an immediate early gene across 15 different limbic and reward regions. We found that females, but not males, showed contextual discrimination during the last days of training. On the test day, both sexes displayed similar levels of freezing, indicating equivalent fear memory for context A. Despite similar fear memory, males showed more positive correlations of zif268 activation between the limbic regions and the striatum, whereas females showed more negative correlations among these regions. Females showed greater activation of the frontal cortex, dorsal CA1, and 3-week-old adult-born dentate granular cells compared to males. These results highlight the importance of studying sex differences in fear memory and the contribution of adult neurogenesis to the neuronal network and may contribute to differences in susceptibility to fear related disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder.",

    "abstract": "Atypical sensory processing is now thought to be a core feature of the autism spectrum. Influential theories have proposed that both increased and decreased neural response reliability within sensory systems could underlie altered sensory processing in autism. Here, we report evidence for abnormally increased reliability of visual-evoked responses in layer 2/3 neurons of adult primary visual cortex in the MECP2-duplication syndrome animal model of autism. Increased response reliability was due in part to decreased response amplitude, decreased fluctuations in endogenous activity, and decreased neuronal coupling to endogenous activity. Similarly to what was observed neuronally, the optokinetic reflex occurred more reliably at low contrasts in mutant mice compared to controls. Retinal responses did not explain our observations. These data suggest that the circuit mechanisms for convolution of sensory-evoked and endogenous signal and noise may be altered in this form of syndromic autism.",

    "abstract": "It has been reported that Koisio technology-modulated water without external additions of any substances can enter several types of aquaporins with significantly higher rate. In this study we determined the effects of Koisio technology-modulated cell culture media (Koisio media) on the energy state of cells. We found that for the lung fibroblast (L929) cell cultures, Koisio media without any additions of external substances led to approximately an 57% increase in the intracellular ATP levels of the cell cultures at the Cell Passage 6 - 18, compared with regular cell culture media. Seemingly surprisingly, we did not find that Koisio media could significantly affect the mitochondrial membrane potential of the cells, compared with regular cell culture media. Collectively, our study has provided first evidence indicating that Koisio media can lead to remarkable increases in the intracellular ATP levels of the L929 cell cultures, suggesting significant potential of Koisio technology in generating energy-enhancing water. Our finding that Koisio media did not affect the mitochondrial membrane potential has suggested that novel mechanisms may underlie the effects of Koisio media on cellular energy.",

    "abstract": "Most mesodermal cells undergo multiple cycles of transition between an epithelial and mesenchymal state during embryonic development. While many studies have addressed the process of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), comparatively less is known regarding the complementary process, mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET), which is essential for organogenesis and has also been proposed to be important for cancer metastasis. The current study investigated MET using the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) of the chick embryo as a model system. We find that MET in the LPM proceeds as a wave, which divides the LPM into distinct mesenchymal, transition, and epithelial zones. In the multilayered mesenchymal zone, many apical epithelial markers, including N-Cadherin (N-Cad), Par-3 and Zo-1, but not atypical protein kinase C (aPKC), are detected as dispersed, partially co-localizing aggregates associated with cell-cell contacts. The transition zone is characterized by the appearance of aPKC and the formation of rosette-like structures characterized by wedge-shaped cells that are apical-basal polarized, with strong co-localization of apical polarity markers, but not yet arranged into distinct epithelial sheets. The transition zone is also enriched in mitotic cells. Subsequently, the rosettes resolve into two well-defined epithelial sheets that constitute the coelomic epithelium, the lining of the internal body cavity.\n\nPrior to any overt signs of apical-basal polarity, fibronectin (FN) begins to accumulate at the future basal side of the incipient epithelium. Interference with Extracellular Matrix (ECM)-integrin signaling through disruption of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) or Talin function hindered the normal progression of the epithelialization process. Cells with disrupted FAK or Talin function retained mesenchymal-like characteristics with respect to cellular morphology and apical-basal marker distribution.\n\nWe propose a two-stage process for MET in the LPM. Initially, in the polarization phase, ECM-integrin-dependent signaling imparts apical-basal polarity, culminating in the activation of aPKC, to drive cell intercalation and rosette formation. Subsequently in the resolution phase, polarized rosette cells, perhaps facilitated by the weakening of cell-cell interactions that occurs during mitosis, expand their apical surface, and spread out to form new connections laterally to their fully epithelial neighbors. This sequence of events is propagated as a wave through the LPM, thus generating an integrated coelomic epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) is used widely to identify both factor binding to genomic DNA and chromatin modifications. Analysis of ChIP-seq data is impacted by regions of the genome which generate ultra-high artifactual signals. To remove these signals from ChIP-seq data, ENCODE developed blacklists, comprehensive sets of regions defined by low mappability and ultra-high signals for human, mouse, worm, and flies. Currently, blacklists are not available for many model and non-model species. Here we describe an alternative approach for removing false-positive peaks we called \"greenscreen\". Greenscreen is facile to implement, requires few input samples, and uses analysis tools frequently employed for ChIP-seq. We show that greenscreen removes artifact signal as effectively as blacklists in Arabidopsis and human ChIP-seq datasets while covering less of the genome, dramatically improving ChIP-seq data quality. Greenscreen filtering reveals true factor binding overlap and of occupancy changes in different genetic backgrounds or tissues. Because it is effective with as few as three inputs, greenscreen is readily adaptable for use in any species or genome build. Although developed for ChIP-seq, greenscreen also identifies artifact signals from other genomic datasets including CUT&RUN. Finally, we present an improved ChIP-seq pipeline which incorporates greenscreen, that detects more true peaks than published methods.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA facile method for removing artifact signal from ChIP-seq that improves downstream analyses",

    "abstract": "Amyloid fibrils formed from leukocyte chemotactic factor 2 (LECT2), a secreted human cytokine, are associated with kidney failure in the disease amyloid LECT2 (ALECT2) amyloidosis. This rare disease was recognized in 2008 and has a variable prevalence worldwide. The mechanisms which lead to ALECT2 fibril deposition are not known and there are no treatments other than kidney transplant. The LECT2 gene harbors a single nucleotide polymorphism that leads to either a valine or isoleucine residue at position 40 of the mature protein. Most of the individuals diagnosed with ALECT2 amyloidosis are homozygous for valine at this position, which led us to hypothesize that the valine-containing variant of LECT2 protein is less stable and more prone to aggregation than the isoleucine-containing variant. Here, we investigate the structure, stability and aggregation of both variants of recombinant LECT2. Both variants have similar structures in solution; unfold in similar concentrations of urea; and aggregate at similar rates under native-like conditions, forming structures that bind to thioflavin T. Chelation of the structural zinc ion destabilizes both variants to a similar extent, and increases the rate at which they aggregate. We do not observe a consistent difference in stability or aggregation between the variants of LECT2, so we suggest that the presence of the valine residue at position 40 does not determine whether an individual is at increased risk of ALECT2 amyloidosis.",

    "abstract": "In the One Health context, wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are central to safeguard water resources. Nonetheless, many questions remain about their effectiveness to prevent the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Most surveillance studies monitor the levels and removal of selected antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in intracellular DNA (iDNA) extracted from WWTP influents and effluents. The role of extracellular free DNA (exDNA) in wastewater is mostly overlooked. In this study, we analyzed the transfer of ARGs and MGEs in a full-scale Nereda(R) reactor removing nutrients with aerobic granular sludge. We tracked the composition and fate of the iDNA and exDNA pools of influent, sludge, and effluent samples. Metagenomics was used to profile the microbiome, resistome, and mobilome signatures of iDNA and exDNA extracts. Selected ARGs and MGEs were analyzed by qPCR. From 2,840 ARGs identified, the genes arr-3 (2%), tetC (1.6%), sul1 (1.5%), oqxB (1.2%), and aph(3\")-Ib (1.2%) were the most abundant among all sampling points and bioaggregates. Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Aeromonas, Acidovorax, Rhodoferax, and Streptomyces populations were the main hosts of ARGs in the sludge. In the effluent, 478 resistance determinants were detected, of which 89% from exDNA potentially released by cell lysis during aeration in the reactor. MGEs and multiple ARGs were co-localized on the same extracellular genetic contigs. These can pose a risk for AMR dissemination by transformation into microorganisms of receiving water bodies. Total intracellular ARGs decreased 3-42% as a result of wastewater treatment. However, the ermB and sul1 genes increased by 2 and 1 log gene copies mL-1, respectively, in exDNA from influent to effluent. The exDNA fractions need to be considered in AMR surveillance, risk assessment, and mitigation.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/482492v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a5eedcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4da78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c324bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a18138_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIA DNA database from an AGS reactor was constructed to study the system resistome, mobilome, and microbiome.\nC_LIO_LIThe genera Pseudomonas and Rhodoferax were the predominant ARG carriers in the system.\nC_LIO_LIMGEs and ARGs often co-localize on contigs recovered from the exDNA of the effluent.\nC_LIO_LIAGS plants are efficient at reducing ARB.\nC_LIO_LIThe exDNA is an underestimated DNA fraction containing ARGs in the effluent.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons disease (PD) is the most commonly diagnosed neurodegenerative disorder Identification of novel prognostic and pathogenesis biomarkers plays a pivotal role in the management of the PD. Next generation sequencing (NGS) dataset from the GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) database were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PD. Gene Ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichmental analyses were performed to elucidate the functional roles of the DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI), modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were established. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to explore the diagnostic values of hub genes in PD. In total, 957 DEGs were identified, of which 478 were up regulated genes and 479 were down regulated genes. GO and pathway enrichment analysis results revealed that the up regulated genes were mainly enriched in nervous system development, cell junction, transporter activity and neuronal system, whereas down regulated genes were mainly enriched in response to stimulus, cell periphery, identical protein binding and immune system. The top hub genes in the constructed PPI network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network and TF-hub gene regulatory network were OTUB1, PPP2R1A, AP2M1, PIN1, USP11, CDK2, IQGAP1, NEDD4, VIM and CDK1. Furthermore, ROC analysis showed that hub genes were having good diagnostic values. We identified a series of essential genes along with the pathways that were most closely related with PD initiation and progression. Our results provide a more detailed molecular mechanism for the advancement of PD, shedding light on the potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is a major component of peri- and extra-cellular matrices and plays important roles in many biological processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. The abundance, size distribution and presentation of HA dictate its biological effects and are also useful indicators of pathologies and disease progression. Methods to assess the molecular mass of free-floating HA and other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are well established. In many biological and technological settings, however, GAGs are displayed on surfaces, and methods to obtain the size of surface-attached GAGs are lacking. Here, we present a method to size HA that is end-attached to surfaces. The method is based on the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and exploits that the softness and thickness of films of grafted HA increase with HA size. These two quantities are sensitively reflected by the ratio of the dissipation shift ({Delta}D) and the negative frequency shift (-{Delta}f) measured by QCM-D upon the formation of HA films. Using a series of size-defined HA preparations, ranging in size from [~]2 kDa tetrasaccharides to [~]1 MDa polysaccharides, we establish a monotonic yet non-linear standard curve of the {Delta}D/-{Delta}f ratio as a function of HA size, which reflects the distinct conformations adopted by grafted HA chains depending on their size and surface coverage. We demonstrate that the standard curve can be used to determine the mean size of HA, as well as other GAGs, such as chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, of preparations of previously unknown size in the range from 1 to 500 kDa, with a resolution of better than 10%. For polydisperse samples, our analysis shows that the process of surface-grafting preferentially selects smaller GAG chains, and thus reduces the average size of GAGs that are immobilised on surfaces comparative to the original solution sample. Our results establish a quantitative method to size HA and other GAGs grafted on surfaces, and also highlight the importance of sizing GAGs directly on surfaces. The method should be useful for the development and quality control of GAG-based surface coatings in a wide range of research areas, from molecular interaction analysis to biomaterials coatings.",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway and hyperactivation of YAP/TAZ are frequently observed in human cancers and represent promising therapeutic targets. However, strategies targeting the mammalian Hippo pathway are limited due to the lack of a well-established cell surface regulator. By combining protein interactome data and clinical data, we have identified transmembrane protein KIRREL1 as an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway. KIRREL1 interacts with Hippo pathway components SAV1 and LATS1/2 via its intracellular C-terminal domain and promotes LATS1/2 activation by MST1/2 (Hippo kinases), in turn inhibiting YAP/TAZ activity and target gene expression. Conversely, YAP/TAZ directly induce the expression of KIRREL1 in a TEAD1-4-dependent manner. In mouse liver tumors driven by YAP activation, KIRREL1 protein is robustly induced. Moreover, KIRREL1 expression positively correlates with canonical YAP/TAZ target gene expression in clinical tumor specimens and predicts poor prognosis. Finally, transgenic expression of KIRREL1 effectively blocked tumorigenesis in a mouse intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma model, suggesting an important role of KIRREL1 in inhibiting cancer development. Together, these findings indicate that KIRREL1 constitutes a negative feedback mechanism regulating the Hippo pathway, and serves as a cell surface marker and potential drug target in cancers with YAP/TAZ dependency.",

    "abstract": "Immunotherapy has had a tremendous impact on cancer treatment in the past decade, with hitherto unseen responses at advanced and metastatic stages of the disease. However, the aggressive brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM) is highly immunosuppressive and remains largely refractory to current immunotherapeutic approaches. The cGAS-STING cytoplasmic double stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensing pathway has emerged as a next-generation immunotherapy target with potent local immune stimulatory properties.\n\nHere, we investigated the status of the STING pathway in GBM and the modulation of the brain tumor microenvironment (TME) with the STING agonist ADU-S100. Our data reveal the presence of STING in human GBM specimens, where it stains strongly in the tumor vasculature. We show that human GBM explants can respond to STING agonist treatment by secretion of inflammatory cytokines. In murine GBM models, we show a profound shift in the tumor immune landscape after STING agonist treatment, with massive infiltration of the tumor-bearing hemisphere with innate immune cells including inflammatory macrophages, neutrophils and NK populations. Treatment of established murine intracranial GL261 and CT-2A tumors by biodegradable ADU-S100-loaded intracranial implants demonstrated a significant increase in survival in both models and long-term survival with immune memory in GL261. Responses to treatment were abolished by NK cell depletion. This study reveals therapeutic potential and deep remodeling of the TME by STING activation in GBM and warrants the further examination of STING agonists alone or in combination with other immunotherapies such as cancer vaccines, CAR T cells, NK therapies or immune checkpoint blockade.\n\nSignificance statementModulation of the immune microenvironment is critical for immunosuppressive and therapy refractory tumors like glioblastoma. Activation of the STING pathway deeply remodels the brain tumor environment and attracts innate immune cells and natural killer cell populations, producing a robust antitumor effect with long-term immune memory. We further show that human glioblastoma tissue can respond to the therapy and lay the foundations for combined intracranial immunotherapies by using crosslinked biodegradable brain implants.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionThe opioid epidemic has seen an increase in drug use among women of reproductive age. It is well established that Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) can have many negative consequences for the health of mothers and their babies, both during pregnancy and after delivery, but our understanding of the impact of fetal opioid exposure on behavior during adolescence and adulthood is less understood. Preclinical studies have unveiled some of the long-term effects of in utero morphine exposure primarily using injections as the route of drug delivery. Our study utilized a model for oral, voluntary morphine self-administration to investigate neonate, adolescent, and adult offsprings behavioral phenotypes and subsequent ethanol misuse liability.\n\nMethodsWe first validated a paradigm for maternal oral intake of morphine, where female mice became morphine dependent pre-pregnancy, and continued to voluntarily consume morphine in the continuous two-bottle choice (C2BC) paradigm during pregnancy and up to offspring postnatal day 7 (PND 7). Offspring were cross-fostered to a drug-naive dam at PND 7, to model first and second trimester in utero exposure in humans and to mimic the stress associated with NOWS. Bodyweight and ultrasonic vocalizations were assessed to determine alterations in the neonates. Offspring from control and morphine-exposed dams were then tested during adolescence and adulthood in a battery of behavioral tests to assess baseline behavioral phenotypes. We also computed a global behavioral score (GBS) to integrate offsprings multiple behavioral outcomes into a composite score that could be used to identify potential vulnerable and resilient populations in offspring exposed prenatally to morphine. Offspring that were tested during adolescence were also evaluated during adulthood in the ethanol intermittent 2BC to assess ethanol misuse risk.\n\nResultsUsing an oral maternal morphine C2BC protocol, we demonstrated that morphine dams display signs of dependence, measured by somatic signs during withdrawal, and voluntarily drink morphine throughout gestation. Neonate cross-fostered offspring display changes in spontaneous activity, body weight, and ultrasonic vocalization parameters. During adolescence, offspring display both increased baseline anxiety-like/compulsive-like behavior, while in adulthood they display increased anxiety-like behavior. No changes were found for baseline physical signs, locomotion, and depressive-like behavior during adolescence or adulthood. In addition, a greater percentage of adult male offspring exposed to maternal morphine fell into moderate and high GBS classifications, signaling a more severe behavioral phenotype, compared to male control offspring. These effects were not observed in adult female offspring exposed to morphine in utero. Additionally, male adult offspring exposed to maternal morphine reduced their 2-hour ethanol intake in the intermittent two-bottle choice (I2BC) paradigm, although no changes in 24-hour ethanol intake and preference were found. No changes were observed in female offspring of morphine-exposed dams.\n\nConclusionOverall, maternal morphine exposure leads to sex-specific changes in neonate, adolescent, and adult behavior, including ethanol intake.",

    "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD), as encountered during shift work, increases the risk of respiratory viral infection including SARS-CoV-2. However, the mechanism(s) underpinning higher rates of respiratory viral infection following SCRD remain poorly characterised. To address this, we investigated the effects of acute sleep deprivation on the mouse lung transcriptome. Here we show that sleep deprivation profoundly alters the transcriptional landscape of the lung, causing the suppression of both innate and adaptive immune systems, disrupting the circadian clock, and activating genes implicated in SARS-CoV-2 replication, thereby generating a lung environment that promotes viral infection and associated disease pathogenesis. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation of how SCRD increases the risk of respiratory viral infections including SARS-CoV-2 and highlights therapeutic avenues for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "NK cells play an important role in suppression of viral replication and are critical for effective control of persistent infections such as herpesviruses. Cytomegalovirus infection is associated with expansion of  adaptive-memory NK cells with a characteristic CD16brightCD56dim NKG2C+ phenotype but the mechanisms by which this population is maintained remain uncertain. We studied NK cell reconstitution in patients undergoing haemopoietic stem cell transplantation and related this to CMV reactivation. NK cells expanded in the early post-transplant period but then remained stable in the absence of viral reactivation. However, a single episode of CMV reactivation led to a rapid and sustained 10-fold increase in NK cell number. NKG2C expression was increased on all NK subsets although the kinetics of expansion peaked at 6 months on immature CD56bright cells whilst continuing to rise on the mature CD56dim pool. Phenotypic maturation was observed by acquisition of CD57 and KIR expression. Transplantation from CMV-seropositive donors was associated with more rapid NK expansion and superior control of viral reactivation. Effective control of viral reactivation was seen when the peripheral NK cell count reached 20,000/ml. These data show that a single episode of CMV reactivation acts to reprogramme hemopoiesis to drive a sustained modulation and expansion of the NK cell pool and reveal further insight into long term regulation of the innate immune repertoire by infectious challenge.\n\nAuthor Summaryim to highlight where your work fits within a broader context; present the significance or possible implications of your work simply and objectively; and avoid the use of acronyms and complex terminology wherever possible. The goal is to make your findings accessible to a wide audience that includes both scientists and non-scientists\n\nInnate immune cells respond rapidly to infectious challenge and it has previously been thought that they were unable to  learn from specific infecitons but provided only short term control. However, in recent years it has become apparent that some subsets of innate cells, termed adaptive natural killer (NK) cells, are permanently increased in people who have become infected with cytomegalovirus. The mechanism by which this is maintained is not known. We studied the kinetics of adaptive NK cell expansion in patients who had recently undergone stem cell (bone marrow) transplantation as CMV very often  reactivates in this setting and allows study of how this affects the immune system. We find that one short term episode of viral replication led to a large and prolonged expansion of adaptive NK cells. Indeed, their levls increasd 11-fold over 10 months.",

    "abstract": "Yellow fever virus (YFV) causes sporadic outbreaks of infection in South America and sub-Saharan Africa. While live-attenuated yellow fever virus vaccines based on three substrains of 17D are considered some of the most effective vaccines in use, problems with production and distribution have created large populations of unvaccinated, vulnerable individuals in endemic areas. To date, specific antiviral therapeutics have not been licensed for human use against YFV or any other related flavivirus. Recent advances in monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology have allowed for identification of numerous candidate therapeutics targeting highly pathogenic viruses, including many flaviviruses. Here, we sought to identify a highly neutralizing antibody targeting YFV envelope (E) protein as a therapeutic candidate. We used human B cell hybridoma technology to isolate mAbs from the circulating memory B cells from human YFV vaccine recipients. These antibodies bound to recombinant YFV E protein and recognized at least five major antigenic sites on E. Two mAbs (designated YFV-136 and YFV-121) recognized a shared antigenic site and neutralized the YFV 17D vaccine strain in vitro. YFV-136 also potently inhibited infection by multiple wild-type YFV strains, in part, at a post-attachment step in the virus replication cycle. YFV-136 showed therapeutic protection in two animal models of YFV challenge including hamsters and immunocompromised mice engrafted with human hepatocytes. These studies define features of the antigenic landscape on YFV E protein recognized by the human B cell response and identify a therapeutic antibody candidate that inhibits infection and disease caused by highly virulent strains of YFV.",

    "abstract": "Infection triggers a dynamic cascade of reciprocal events between host and pathogen wherein the host activates complex mechanisms to recognise and kill pathogens while the pathogen adjusts its virulence and fitness to avoid eradication by the host. The interaction between the pathogen and the host results in large-scale changes in gene expression in both organisms. Dual RNA-seq, the simultaneous detection of host and pathogen transcripts, has become a leading approach to unravel complex molecular interactions between the host and the pathogen and is particularly informative for intracellular organisms. The amount of in vitro and in vivo dual RNA-seq data is rapidly growing which demands computational pipelines to effectively analyse such data. In particular, holistic, systems-level, and temporal analyses of dual RNA-seq data are essential to enable further insights into the host-pathogen transcriptional dynamics and potential interactions. Here, we developed an integrative network-driven bioinformatics pipeline, dRNASb, a systems biology-based computational pipeline to analyse temporal transcriptional clusters, incorporate molecular interaction networks (e.g., protein-protein interactions), identify topologically and functionally key transcripts in host and pathogen, and associate host and pathogen temporal transcriptome to decipher potential between-species interactions. The pipeline is applicable to various dual RNA-seq data from different species and experimental conditions. As a case study, we applied dRNASb to analyse temporal dual RNA-seq data of Salmonella-infected human cells, which enabled us to uncover genes contributing to the infection process and their potential functions and to identify potential host-pathogen interactions between host and pathogen genes. Overall, dRNASb has the potential to identify key genes involved in bacterial growth or host defence mechanisms for future uses as therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) establishes latent infection in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons after productive (lytic) infection in peripheral tissues. A neuron-specific microRNA, miR-138, favors HSV-1 latency by repressing viral ICP0, and host Oct-1 and Foxc1 genes, yet the role of miR-138 in HSV-2 infection was unknown. The ICP0 mRNAs of HSV-1, HSV-2 and chimpanzee herpesvirus each have one to two canonical miR-138 binding sites. The sites are 100% conserved in 308 HSV-1 and 300 HSV-2 published sequences of clinical isolates. In co-transfection assays, miR-138 repressed HSV-2 ICP0 expression through the seed region and surrounding interactions that are different from HSV-1. An HSV-2 mutant with disrupted miR-138 binding sites on ICP0 showed increased ICP0 expression in Neuro-2a cells. Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation confirmed miR-138 binding to HSV-2 ICP0, and identified UL19 and UL20 as additional targets, whose expression was repressed by miR-138 during co-transfection. In Neuro-2a cells, transfected miR-138 and its antagomir decreased and increased HSV-2 replication, respectively, and knockout experiment showed that miR-138s host targets OCT-1 and FOXC1 were important for HSV-2 replication. In primary mouse DRG neurons, both ICP0 and FOXC1 positively regulated HSV-2 replication, but both overexpressed and endogenous miR-138 suppressed HSV-2 replication primarily by repressing ICP0 expression. Thus, miR-138 can suppress HSV-2 neuronal replication through multiple viral and host pathways. These results reveal functional similarities and mechanistic differences in how miR-138 regulates HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection and indicate an evolutionary advantage of using miR-138 to repress lytic infection in neurons.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 are closely related viruses with major differences. Both viruses establish latency in neurons from which they reactivate to cause disease. A key aspect of HSV latency is repression of productive infection in neurons. Based on previous work with HSV-1, we investigated the role of a neuron-specific microRNA, miR-138, in HSV-2 infection, and established it as a repressor of HSV-2 productive infection in neuronal cells. This repression is mediated mainly by targeting viral ICP0 and host Foxc1 mRNAs, but other pathways also contribute. Despite functional conservation of the role of miR-138 between HSV-1 and HSV-2, many molecular mechanisms differ including how miR-138 represses ICP0 expression and miR-138 targeting of HSV-2 but not HSV-1 UL19 and UL20. To our knowledge, this study provides the first example of host microRNA regulation of HSV-2 infection.",

Since its identification in November 2021, Omicron, a highly transmissible variant, has become the dominant variant in most countries. Omicrons highly mutated spike protein, the main target of vaccine development, significantly compromises the immune protection from current vaccination. We develop an mRNA vaccine (SOmicron-6P) based on an Omicron-specific sequence. In mice, SOmicron-6P shows superior neutralizing antibodies inducing abilities to a clinically approved inactivated virus vaccine, a clinically approved protein subunit vaccine, and an mRNA vaccine (SWT-2P) with the same sequence of BNT162b2 RNA. Significantly, SOmicron-6P induces a 14.4[~]27.7-fold and a 28.3[~]50.3-fold increase of neutralizing activity against the pseudovirus of Omicron and authentic Omicron compared to SWT-2P, respectively. In addition, two doses SOmicron-6P significantly protects Syrian hamsters against challenge with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant and elicits high titers of nAbs in a dose-dependent manner in macaques. Our results suggest that SOmicron-6P offers advantages over current vaccines, and it will be helpful for those with weak immunity.",

    "abstract": "Antiseptics are widely used in oral healthcare to prevent or treat oral diseases, such as gingivitis and periodontitis. However, the incidence of bacteria being tolerant to standard antiseptics has sharply increased over the last few years. This stresses the urgency for surveillance against tolerant organisms, as well as the discovery of novel antimicrobials. Traditionally, susceptibility to antimicrobials is assessed by broth micro-dilution or disc diffusion assays, both of which are time-consuming, labor-intensive and provide limited information on the mode of action of the antimicrobials. The above-mentioned limitations highlight the need for the development of new methods to monitor and further understand antimicrobial susceptibility. Here, we used real-time flow cytometry, combined with membrane permeability staining, as a quick and sensitive technology to study the quantitative and qualitative response of two oral pathobionts to different concentrations of chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride or triclosan. Apart from the real-time monitoring of cell damage, we further applied a phenotypic fingerprint method to differentiate between the bacterial subpopulations that arose due to treatment. We quantified the pathobiont damage rate of different antiseptics at different concentrations within 15 minutes of exposure and identified the conditions under which the bacteria were most susceptible. Moreover, we detected species-specific and treatment-specific phenotypic subpopulations. This proves that real-time flow cytometry can provide information on the susceptibility of different microorganisms in a short time frame while differentiating between antiseptics and thus could be a valuable tool in the discovery of novel antimicrobial compounds while at the same time deciphering their mode of action.",

Here, we established that a mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection increased the risk of pneumococcal coinfection in a time-dependent, but sexindependent, manner in the transgenic K18-hACE mouse model of COVID-19. Bacterial coinfection was not established at 3 d post-virus, but increased lethality was observed when the bacteria was initiated at 5 or 7 d post-virus infection (pvi). Bacterial outgrowth was accompanied by neutrophilia in the groups coinfected at 7 d pvi and reductions in B cells, T cells, IL-6, IL-15, IL-18, and LIF were present in groups coinfected at 5 d pvi. However, viral burden, lung pathology, cytokines, chemokines, and immune cell activation were largely unchanged after bacterial coinfection. Examining surviving animals more than a week after infection resolution suggested that immune cell activation remained high and was exacerbated in the lungs of coinfected animals compared with SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 increases susceptibility and pathogenicity to bacterial coinfection, and further studies are needed to understand and combat disease associated with bacterial pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, the virus behind the deadly COVID-19 pandemic, continues to spread globally even as vaccine strategies are proving effective in preventing hospitalizations and deaths. However, evolving variants of the virus appear to be more transmissive and vaccine efficacy towards them is waning. As a result, SARS-CoV-2 will continue to have a deadly impact on public health into the foreseeable future. One strategy to bypass the continuing problem of newer variants is to target host proteins required for viral replication. We have used this host-targeted antiviral (HTA) strategy that targets DDX3, a host DEAD-box RNA helicase that is usurped by SARS-CoV-2 for virus production. We demonstrated that targeting DDX3 with RK-33, a small molecule inhibitor, reduced the viral load in four isolates of SARS-CoV-2 (Lineage A, and Lineage B Alpha, Beta, and Delta variants) by one to three log orders in Calu-3 cells. Furthermore, proteomics and RNA-seq analyses indicated that most SARS-CoV-2 genes were downregulated by RK-33 treatment. Also, we show that the use of RK-33 decreases TMPRSS2 expression, which may be due to DDX3s ability to unwind G-quadraplex structures present in the TMPRSS2 promoter. The data presented supports the use of RK-33 as an HTA strategy to control SARS-CoV-2 infection, irrespective of its mutational status, in humans.",

    "abstract": "Growing evidence suggest that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are critical mediators in renal diseases. However, there have been very few reports about the role of circRNAs in renal fibrosis. In this study, circRNA_33702 was found to be upregulated, both in UUO mice and in TGF-{beta} 1-treated BUMPT cells. Whilst knockdown of circRNA_33702 was shown to relieve the TGF-{beta} 1-induced expression of collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin; overexpression of circRNA_33702 was found to exert an inhibitory effect on the expression of the same genes. Mechanistically, circRNA_33702 was demonstrated to bind directly with miR-29b-3p and inhibit its expression. Moreover, WISP1 was identified as a target of miR-29b-3p and the expression of WISP1 was observed to be repressed by miR-29b-3p. Notably, knockdown of circRNA_33702 was found to attenuate the expression of collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin by inhibiting the expression of WISP1, and the observed inhibitory effect can be reversed by miR-29b-3p inhibitor. Finally, inhibition of circRNA_33702 was shown to attenuate interstitial fibrosis in UUO mice via the miR-29b-3p/WISP1 axis. In general, our data show that circRNA_33702 may promote renal fibrosis via the miR-29b-3p/WISP1 axis, which may potentially be developed as a new therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Soapberry (Sapindus mukorossi Gaertn.) pericarps are rich in valuable bioactive triterpenoid saponins. However, the saponin content dynamics and the molecular regulatory network of saponin biosynthesis in soapberry pericarps remain largely unclear. Here, we performed combined metabolite profiling and transcriptome analysis to identify saponin accumulation kinetic patterns, investigate gene networks, and characterize key candidate genes and transcription factors involved in saponin biosynthesis in soapberry pericarps. A total of 54 saponins were tentatively identified, including 25 that were differentially accumulated. Furthermore, 49 genes putatively involved in sapogenin backbone biosynthesis and some candidate genes assumed to be responsible for the backbone modification, including 41 cytochrome P450s and 45 glycosyltransferases, were identified. Saponin-specific clusters/modules were identified by Mfuzz clustering and weighted gene co-expression network analysis, and one TF-gene regulatory network underlying saponin biosynthesis was proposed. The results of yeast one-hybrid assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay suggested that SmbHLH2, SmTCP4, and SmWRKY27 may play important roles in the triterpenoid saponin biosynthesis by directly regulating the transcription of SmCYP71D-3 in soapberry pericarp. Overall, these findings provide valuable information for understanding the molecular regulatory mechanism of saponin biosynthesis, enriching the gene resources, and guiding further research on triterpenoid saponin accumulation in soapberry pericarps.\n\nOne-sentence summaryCombining metabolome and transcriptome analysis to identify saponin kinetic patterns, gene networks, and key candidate genes and transcription factors involved in saponin biosynthesis of soapberry.",

    "abstract": "It is of vital practical interest to understand the co-evolution of bat {beta}-coronaviruses with their hosts, since a number of these most likely crossed the species boundaries and infected humans. Complete sequences of 47 consensus genomes are available for bat {beta}-coronaviruses related to the SARS-CoV-2 human virus. We carried out several types of evolutionary analyses using these data. First, using the publicly available BEAST 2 software, we generated phylogenetic trees and skyline plots. The roots of the trees, both for the entire sequences and subsequences coding for the E and S proteins as well as the 5 and 3 UTR regions, are estimated to be located from several decades to more than a thousand years ago, while the effective population sizes remained largely constant. Motivated by this, we developed a simple estimator of the effective population size in a Moran model with constant population, which, under the model is equal to the expected age of the MRCA measured in generations. Comparisons of these estimates to those produced by BEAST 2 shows qualitative agreement. We also compared the site frequency spectra (SFS) of the bat genomes to those provided by the Moran Tug-of-War model. Comparison does not exclude the possibility that overall fitness of the bat {beta}-coronaviruses was increasing over time as a result of directional selection. Stability of interactions of bats and their viruses was considered likely on the basis of specific manner in which bat immunity is tuned, and it seems consistent with our analysis.",

Although it is well established that the primary cilium is essential for Hedgehog (HH) signalling and HH signalling is abnormally activated in cystic kidneys of multiple PKD models, the mechanism and function of HH activation in PKD pathogenesis remains incompletely understood.\n\nMethodsWe used a transgenic HH reporter line to identify the target tissue of HH signalling in Arl13f/f;Ksp-Cre mutant kidney, in which the cilia biogenesis gene Arl13b is specifically deleted in epithelial cells of the distal nephron. In addition, we treated Arl13bf/f;Ksp-Cre mice with the GLI inhibitor GANT61 and analyzed its impact on PKD progression in this model.\n\nResultsIn vivo in the mouse kidney, deletion of Arl13b in epithelial cells led to non-cell autonomous activation of the HH pathway in the interstitium. In addition, whole body inhibition of the HH pathway by GANT61 reduced cyst burden, suppressed fibrosis and reduced kidney function decline in Arl13bf/f;Ksp-Cre mice.\n\nConclusionsOur results reveal non-cell autonomous activation of HH signalling in the interstitium of the cystic kidney of Arl13bf/f;Ksp-Cre mice and suggest that abnormal activation of the HH pathway contributes to PKD progression.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified 266 genes and predicted an additional 38 genes that suppress the accumulation of spontaneous gross chromosomal rearrangements (GCRs). Here we identified mutations that induce two DNA damage response (DDR) markers, Hug1 expression and Ddc2 foci, and combined these data with other published screens identifying mutations inducing other DDR markers, including Rad52 foci and Rnr3 expression. Together, these data identify four categories of mutations: most mutations were DDR- GCR-, 356 were DDR+ GCR-, 72 were DDR- GCR+, and 157 were DDR+ GCR+. These results indicate that induction of DDR markers alone, while allowing DDR analysis, is not a reliable indicator of increased genome instability. They also guide further analysis of mechanistically distinct groups of GCR-inducing mutations, such as mutations that increase levels of GCR-inducing DNA damage and mutations that result in mis-repair of normal levels of DNA damage resulting in GCRs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDespite numerous molecular and computational advances, roughly half of patients with a rare disease remain undiagnosed after exome or genome sequencing. A particularly challenging barrier to diagnosis is identifying variants that cause deleterious alternative splicing at intronic or exonic loci outside of canonical donor or acceptor splice sites.\n\nResultsSeveral existing tools predict the likelihood that a genetic variant causes alternative splicing. We sought to extend such methods by developing a new metric that aids in discerning whether a genetic variant leads to deleterious alternative splicing. Our metric combines genetic variation in the Genome Aggregate Database with alternative splicing predictions from SpliceAI to compare observed and expected levels of splice-altering genetic variation. We infer genic regions with significantly less splice-altering variation than expected to be constrained. The resulting model of regional splicing constraint captures differential splicing constraint across gene and exon categories, and the most constrained genic regions are enriched for pathogenic splice-altering variants. Building from this model, we developed ConSpliceML. This ensemble machine learning approach combines regional splicing constraint with multiple per-nucleotide alternative splicing scores to guide the prediction of deleterious splicing variants in protein-coding genes. ConSpliceML more accurately distinguishes deleterious and benign splicing variants than state-of-the-art splicing prediction methods, especially in \"cryptic\" splicing regions beyond canonical donor or acceptor splice sites.\n\nConclusionIntegrating a model of genetic constraint with annotations from existing alternative splicing tools allows ConSpliceML to prioritize potentially deleterious splice-altering variants in studies of rare human diseases.",

The extracellular lipase A belongs to the virulence factors of P. aeruginosa. The lipase undergoes folding and activation in the periplasm prior the secretion. Here, we demonstrate that the ubiquitous periplasmic chaperone Skp of P. aeruginosa, but not SurA, FkpA, PpiD or YfgM, efficiently prevents misfolding of the aggregation-prone lipase A and facilitates its activation by a specific foldase LipH. Small-angle X-ray scattering visualizes the trimeric architecture of P. aeruginosa Skp and identifies two primary conformations of the chaperone, a compact and a widely open. We describe two binding modes of Skp to the lipase, with affinities of 20 nM and 2 M, which correspond to 1:1 and 1:2 stoichiometry of the lipase:Skp complex. Two Skp trimers are required to stabilize the lipase via the apolar interactions, which are not affected by high salt concentrations typical for the sputum of cystic fibrosis patients. The chaperoning effect of Skp points to its potent role in maturation and secretion of the lipase in Pseudomonas species.",

    "abstract": "Over 100 mutations in the rhodopsin gene have been linked to a spectrum of retinopathies that include retinitis pigmentosa and congenital stationary night blindness. Though most of these variants exhibit a loss of function, the molecular defects caused by these underlying mutations vary considerably. In this work, we utilize deep mutational scanning to quantitatively compare the plasma membrane expression of 123 known pathogenic rhodopsin variants in the presence and absence of the stabilizing cofactor 9-cis-retinal. We identify 69 retinopathy variants, including 20 previously uncharacterized variants, that exhibit diminished plasma membrane expression in HEK293T cells. 67 of these apparent class II variants exhibit a measurable increase in expression in the presence of 9-cis-retinal. However, the magnitude of the response to this molecule varies considerably across this spectrum of mutations. Evaluation of the observed shifts in relation to thermodynamic estimates for the coupling between binding and folding suggests underlying differences in stability constrains the magnitude of their response to retinal. Nevertheless, estimates from computational modeling suggest many of the least sensitive variants also directly compromise binding. Finally, we evaluate the functional properties of three previous uncharacterized, retinal-sensitive variants ({Delta}N73, S131P, and R135G) and show that two retain residual function in vitro. Together, our results provide a comprehensive experimental characterization of the proteostatic properties of retinopathy variants and their response to retinal.",

Integrons within mobile genetic elements often contain multiple antibiotic resistance genes that they spread among nosocomial pathogens and contribute to the current antibiotic resistance crisis.

IntegronFinder is a widely used software to identify novel integrons in bacterial genomes, but has aged and lacks some useful functionalities to handle very large datasets of draft genomes or metagenomes. Here, we present IntegronFinder version 2. We have updated the code, improved its efficiency and usability, adapted the output to incomplete genome data, and added a few novel functions. We describe these changes and illustrate the relevance of the program by analyzing the distribution of integrons across more than 20,000 fully sequenced genomes. We also take full advantage of its novel capabilities to analyze close to 4 thousand Klebsiella pneumoniae genomes for the presence of integrons and antibiotic resistance genes within them. Our data shows that K. pneumoniae has a large diversity of integrons and the largest mobile integron in our database of plasmids. The pangenome of these integrons contains a total of 165 different gene families with most of the largest families being related with resistance to numerous types of antibiotics.

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 1 in 400 people. Almost 40 genes have been associated with ALS, currently explaining about 15% of the ALS risk. These genes tend to cluster in certain disease pathways such as protein quality control, RNA metabolism and axonal function. Despite these advances, adequate treatments for ALS patients are still missing. In this study, we investigate the role of a newly discovered ALS gene, C21orf2, in ALS pathology. We show that C21orf2 is localized to the basal body of the primary cilium and plays an important role in ciliogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Knock down of C21orf2 also lowers cilia frequency and length in human iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons (sMNs). Furthermore, we show that intraflagellar transport is impaired, causing primary cilia to fail in transducing extracellular signals essential in the sonic hedgehog pathway. ALS-associated mutations in C21orf2 lead to loss of binding to centrosomal proteins, loss of proper localization at the basal body and hereby prevent C21orf2 from carrying out its normal function in cilia by loss-of-function. Finally, we confirm that sMNs derived from iPSCs from ALS patients with C21orf2 mutations display similar cilia dysfunction and have disturbed sonic hedgehog signaling. Collectively, our data reveal impaired cilia homeostasis as a novel disease mechanism at play in ALS, opening new avenues for further research.",

    "abstract": "The extreme neurotoxicity of botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs), broadly used as a therapeutics, is mediated by their direct binding to two plasma membrane receptors: polysialogangliosides (PSGs) and serotype-dependently either synaptotagmin 1/2 (Syt1/2) or synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 (SV2). Here, we demonstrate that although BoNT/A serotype binds directly to PSG and SV2, its neurotoxicity depends on Syt1. Using single-molecule superresolution microscopy of pathological concentrations of BoNT/A holotoxins, we demonstrate that the toxin binds to a preassembled PSG-Syt1 complex that forms nanoclusters with SV2 on the plasma membrane of hippocampal neurons. This coincidental interaction controls the selective endocytic targeting of BoNT/A into synaptic vesicles, leading to incapacitation of neuronal communication. Our results suggest that Syt1-SV2 plasma membrane nanoclusters may acts as a common target for various BoNT serotypes.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryBoNT/A hijacks an intrinsic tripartite PSG-Syt1-SV2 endocytic sorting mechanism to incapacitate neuronal communication",

    "abstract": "Immigration and activation of immune cells play a significant role in damage progression after ischemic stroke. It has been shown that the nuclear receptor NR4A1 exerts a crucial role within the inflammatory response of various immune diseases via regulating immune cell activation. In this study, we investigated the role of NR4A1 on the activation and recruitment of brain resident and peripheral immune cells after cerebral ischemia. Here, we show that NR4A1 mediates an anti-inflammatory and damage limiting effect after ischemic stroke through immigrating neutrophil granulocytes. Importantly, NR4A1-activation with its ligand Cytosporone-B improves functional outcome and diminishes brain damage. Therefore, modulation of NR4A1 is a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of stroke.",

    "abstract": "The immunoglobulin genes of inbred mouse strains that are commonly used in models of antibody-mediated human diseases are poorly characterized. This compromises data analysis. To infer the immunoglobulin genes of BALB/c mice, we used long-read SMRT sequencing to amplify VDJ-C sequences from F1 (BALB/c x C57BL/6) hybrid animals. Previously unreported strain variations were identified in the Ighm and Ighg2b genes, and analysis of VDJ rearrangements led to the inference of 278 germline IGHV alleles. 169 alleles are not present in the C57BL/6 genome reference sequence. To establish a set of expressed BALB/c IGHV germline gene sequences, we computationally retrieved IGHV haplotypes from the IgM dataset. Haplotyping led to the confirmation of 162 BALB/c IGHV gene sequences. A musIGHV398 pseudogene variant also appears to be present in the BALB/cByJ substrain, while a functional musIGHV398 gene is highly expressed in the BALB/cJ substrain. Only four of the BALB/c alleles were also observed in the C57BL/6 haplotype. The full set of inferred BALB/c sequences has been used to establish a BALB/c IGHV reference set, hosted at https://ogrdb.airr-community.org. We assessed whether assemblies from the Mouse Genome Project (MGP) are suitable for the determination of the genes of the IGH loci. Only 37 (43.5%) of the 85 confirmed IMGT-named BALB/c IGHV and 33 (42.9%) of the 77 confirmed non-IMGT IGHV were found in a search of the MGP BALB/cJ genome assembly. This suggests that Adaptive Immune Receptor Repertoire sequencing (AIRR-Seq) data, but not currently-available genome assemblies, are suited to the documentation of germline IGHV genes.",

    "abstract": "In Bacillus subtilis, a ParB-like nucleoid occlusion protein (Noc) binds specifically to Noc-binding sites (NBS) around the chromosome to help coordinate chromosome segregation and cell division. Noc does so by binding to cytidine triphosphate (CTP) to form large membrane-associated nucleoprotein complexes to physically inhibit the assembly of the cell division machinery. The site-specific binding of Noc to NBS DNA is a prerequisite for CTP-binding and the subsequent formation of a membrane-active DNA-entrapped protein complex. Here, we solve the structure of a truncated B. subtilis Noc bound to NBS DNA to reveal the conformation of Noc at this crucial step. Our structure reveals the disengagement between the N-terminal CTP-binding domain and the NBS-binding domain of each DNA-bound Noc subunit, this is driven, in part, by the swapping of helices 4 and 5 at the interface of the two domains. Site-specific crosslinking data suggest that this conformation of Noc-NBS exists in solution. Overall, our results lend support to the recent proposal that parS/NBS-binding catalyzes CTP-binding and DNA-entrapment by preventing the re-engagement of the NTD and DBD from the same ParB/Noc subunit.",

    "abstract": "The respiratory tract represents the key target for antiviral delivery in early interventions to prevent severe COVID-19. While neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAb) possess considerable efficacy, their current reliance on parenteral dosing necessitates very large doses and places a substantial burden on the healthcare system. In contrast, direct inhaled delivery of mAb therapeutics offers the convenience of self-dosing at home, as well as much more efficient mAb delivery to the respiratory tract. Here, building on our previous discovery of Fc-mucin interactions crosslinking viruses to mucins, we showed that regdanvimab, a potent neutralizing mAb already approved for COVID-19 in several countries around the world, can effectively trap SARS-CoV-2 virus-like-particles in fresh human airway mucus. IN-006, a reformulation of Regdanvimab, was stably nebulized across a wide range of concentrations, with no loss of activity and no formation of aggregates. Finally, nebulized delivery of IN-006 resulted in 100-fold greater mAb levels in the lungs of rats compared to serum, in marked contrast to intravenously dosed mAbs. These results not only support our current efforts to evaluate the safety and efficacy of IN-006 in clinical trials, but more broadly substantiate nebulized delivery of human antiviral mAbs as a new paradigm in treating SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathologies.",

Scale-limited CRISPR-Cas9 screens - typically employing guide RNA libraries targeting subsets of functionally related genes, individual biological pathways, or portions of the druggable genome - constitute an optimal setting for investigating narrow hypotheses and they are easier to execute on complex models, such as organoids and in vivo models. Different supervised methods are used for the computational analysis of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens; most are not well suited for scale-limited screens as they require large sets of positive/negative control genes (gene templates) to be included among the screened ones.

    "abstract": "Despite a rapid expansion in the number of known RNA viruses following the advent of metagenomic sequencing, the identification and annotation of highly divergent RNA viruses remains challenging, particularly from poorly characterized hosts and environmental samples. Protein structures are more conserved than primary sequence data, such that structure-based comparisons provide an opportunity to reveal the viral \"dusk matter\": viral sequences with low, but detectable, levels of sequence identity to known viruses with available protein structures. Here, we present a new open computational and resource - RdRp-scan - that contains a standardized bioinformatic toolkit to identify and annotate divergent RNA viruses in metagenomic sequence data based on the detection of RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequences. By combining RdRp-specific Hidden Markov models (HMM) and structural comparisons we show that RdRp-scan can efficiently detect RdRp sequences with identity levels as low as 10% to those from known viruses and not identifiable using standard sequence-to-sequence comparisons. In addition, to facilitate the annotation and placement of newly detected and divergent virus-like sequences into the known diversity of RNA viruses, RdRp-scan provides new custom and curated databases of viral RdRp sequences and core motif, as well as pre-built RdRp alignments. In parallel, our analysis of the sequence diversity detected by RdRp-scan revealed that while most of the taxonomically unassigned RdRps fell into pre-established clusters, some sequences cluster into potential new orders of RNA viruses related to the Wolframvirales and Tolivirales. Finally, a survey of the conserved A, B and C RdRp motifs within the RdRp-scan sequence database revealed additional variations of both sequence and position, which might provide new insights into the structure, function and evolution of viral RdRps.",

    "abstract": "Though native to Scotland, the grey wolf (Canis lupus) was extirpated c.250 years ago as part of a global eradication drive. The global population has recently expanded, now occupying 67% of its former range. Evidence is growing that apex predators provide a range of ecological benefits, most stemming from the reduction of overgrazing by deer - something from which Scotland suffers. In this study, we build a rule-based habitat suitability model for wolves on the Scottish mainland. From existing literature, we identify the most important variables as land cover, prey density, road density and human density, and establish thresholds of suitability for each. Fuzzy membership functions are used to assign suitability values to each variable, followed by fuzzy overlay to combine all four: a novel approach to habitat suitability modelling for terrestrial mammals. Model sensitivity is tested for land cover and prey density, as these variables constitute a knowledge gap and an incomplete dataset, respectively. The Highlands and Grampian mountains emerge strongly and consistently as the most suitable areas, largely due to high negative covariance between prey density and road/human density. Sensitivity testing reveals the models are fairly robust to changes in prey density, but less robust to changes in the scoring of land cover, with the latter altering the distribution of land mainly through the 70 - 100% suitability range. However, in statistical significance tests, only the least and most generous versions of the model emerge as giving significantly different results. Depending on the version of the model, a contiguous area of between 10,139km2 and 18,857km2 is shown to be 80 to 100% suitable. This could be sufficient to support between 50 and 94 packs of four wolves, if the average pack range size is taken to be 200km2. We conclude that in terms of habitat availability, reintroduction should be feasible.",

    "abstract": "The Lesser Pacific Striped Octopus, Octopus chierchiae, is a small iteroparous octopus known to inhabit intertidal regions of the Pacific coast of Central America. Many details about its life history and ecology remain unknown. For apparently rare and delicate animals such as O. chierchiae, non-extractive sampling methods are necessary to study individuals and populations over time. After photographically documenting the physical development of 25 octopuses from hatching, we have concluded that O. chierchiae has individually unique stripe configurations that remain constant throughout their post-hatchling lifetimes. Furthermore, using photographs taken of animals in captivity on different dates over many months, we show that untrained volunteers can accurately identify whether or not a pair of images depicts the same individual octopus. These results demonstrate that laboratory-reared individuals could be identified via photographs taken at different points in their lifetimes, which suggests wild individuals can also be recognized and observed for longitudinal field studies. In addition, our results imply potential for photoidentification and community science to be used as non-extractive, non-intrusive sampling methods for future studies of wild O. chierchiae.",
