    "abstract": "Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten consumption. To identify the role of gut microbes in CD onset, we performed a longitudinal study focusing on two important phases of gut microbiota development at ages 2.5 and 5 (n=16). We obtained samples from children who developed CD during or after the study (CD progressors) and age, sex, and HLA-matched healthy controls. CD progressors had a distinct gut microbiota composition and IgA-sequencing identified unique IgA targets in the gut. Three cytokines, one chemokine, and 19 plasma metabolites were significantly altered in CD progressors at age 5. Feeding C57BL/6J mice with taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA), a 2-fold increased microbiota-derived metabolite in CD progressors, caused villous atrophy, increased intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), CD4+ T-cells, Natural Killer cells, and Qa-1 expression on T-cells while decreasing T-regulatory cells in IELs. Thus, TDCA drives inflammation in the small intestines that potentially contribute to the CD onset.\n\nHighlightsO_LICD progressors have a distinct gut microbiome composition compared to healthy controls in two important phases of gut microbiota development (age 2.5 and 5 years)\nC_LIO_LICD progressors have more IgA-coated bacteria in their gut at age 5 compared to healthy controls.

    "abstract": "Recognition of a pathogen avirulence (AVR) effector protein by a cognate plant resistance (R) protein triggers a set of immune responses that render the plant resistant. Pathogens can escape this so-called Effector-Triggered Immunity (ETI) by different mechanisms including the deletion or loss-of-function mutation of the AVR gene, the incorporation of point mutations that allow recognition to be evaded while maintaining virulence function, and the acquisition of new effectors that suppress AVR recognition. The Dothideomycete Leptosphaeria maculans, causal agent of oilseed rape stem canker, is one of the few fungal pathogens where suppression of ETI by an AVR effector has been demonstrated. Indeed, AvrLm4-7 suppresses Rlm3- and Rlm9- mediated resistance triggered by AvrLm3 and AvrLm5-9, respectively. The presence of AvrLm4-7 does not impede AvrLm3 and AvrLm5-9 expression, and the three AVR proteins do not appear to physically interact. To decipher the epistatic interaction between these L. maculans AVR effectors, we determined the crystal structure of AvrLm5-9 and obtained a 3D model of AvrLm3, based on the crystal structure of Ecp11-1, a homologous AVR effector candidate from Fulvia fulva. Despite a lack of sequence similarity, AvrLm5-9 and AvrLm3 are structural analogues of AvrLm4-7 (structure previously characterized). Structure-informed sequence database searches identified a larger number of putative structural analogues among L. maculans effector candidates, including the AVR effector AvrLmS-Lep2, all produced during the early stages of oilseed rape infection, as well as among effector candidates from other phytopathogenic fungi. These structural analogues are named LARS (for Leptosphaeria AviRulence and Suppressing) effectors. Remarkably, transformants of L. maculans expressing one of these structural analogues, Ecp11-1, triggered oilseed rape immunity in several genotypes carrying Rlm3. Furthermore, this resistance could be suppressed by AvrLm4-7. These results suggest that Ecp11-1 shares a common activity with AvrLm3 within the host plant which is detected by Rlm3, or that the Ecp11-1 structure is sufficiently close to that of AvrLm3 to be recognized by Rlm3.\n\nAuthor summaryAn efficient strategy to control fungal diseases in the field is genetic control using resistant crop cultivars. Crop resistance mainly relies on gene-for-gene relationships between plant resistance (R) genes and pathogen avirulence (AVR) genes, as defined by Flor in the 1940s. However, such gene-for-gene relationships can increase in complexity over the course of plant-pathogen co-evolution. Resistance against the plant-pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans by Brassica napus and other Brassica species relies on the recognition of effector (AVR) proteins by R proteins; however, L. maculans produces an effector that suppresses a subset of these specific resistances. Using a protein structure approach, we revealed structural analogy between several of the resistance-triggering effectors, the resistance-suppressing effector, and effectors from other plant-pathogenic species in the Dothideomycetes and Sordariomycetes classes, defining a new family of effectors called LARS. Notably, cross-species expression of one LARS effector from Fulvia fulva, a pathogen of tomato, in L. maculans resulted in recognition by several resistant cultivars of oilseed rape. These results highlight the need to integrate knowledge on effector structures to improve resistance management and to develop broad-spectrum resistances for multi-pathogen control of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Studying the visual system with fMRI often requires using localizer paradigms to define regions of interest (ROIs). However, the considerable interindividual variability of the cerebral cortex represents a crucial confound for group-level analyses. Cortex-based alignment (CBA) techniques reliably reduce interindividual macroanatomical variability. Yet, their utility has not been assessed for visual field localizer paradigms, which map specific parts of the visual field within retinotopically organized visual areas. We evaluated CBA for an attention-enhanced visual field localizer mapping homologous parts of each visual quadrant in 50 participants. We compared CBA with volume-based alignment and a surface-based analysis, which did not include macroanatomical alignment. CBA led to the strongest increase in the probability of activation overlap (up to 40 percent). On the group level, CBA led to the most consistent increase in ROI size while preserving vertical ROI symmetry. Overall, our results indicate, that in addition to the increased signal-to-noise ratio of a surface-based analysis macroanatomical alignment considerably improves statistical power. These findings confirm and extend the utility of CBA for the study of the visual system in the context of group analyses. CBA should be particularly relevant when studying neuropsychiatric disorders with abnormally increased interindividual macroanatomical variability.",

    "abstract": "Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a valuable tool for inferring causal relationships among a wide range of traits using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWASs). Existing summary-level MR methods often rely on strong assumptions, resulting in many false positive findings. To relax MR assumptions, ongoing research has been primarily focused on accounting for confounding due to pleiotropy. Here we show that sample structure is another major confounding factor, including population stratification, cryptic relatedness, and sample overlap. We propose a unified MR approach, MR-APSS, which (i) accounts for pleiotropy and sample structure simultaneously by leveraging genome-wide information; and (ii) allows to include more genetic variants with moderate effects as instrument variables (IVs) to improve statistical power without inflating type I errors. We first evaluated MR-APSS using comprehensive simulations and negative controls, and then applied MR-APSS to study the causal relationships among a collection of diverse complex traits. The results suggest that MR-APSS can better identify plausible causal relationships with high reliability. In particular, MR-APSS can perform well for highly polygenic traits, where the IV strengths tend to be relatively weak and existing summary-level MR methods for causal inference are vulnerable to confounding effects.",

    "abstract": "Voluntary movement requires communication from cortex to the spinal cord, where a dedicated pool of motor units (MUs) activates each muscle. The canonical description of MU function rests upon two foundational tenets. First, cortex cannot control MUs independently but supplies each pool with a common drive. Second, MUs are recruited in a rigid fashion that largely accords with Hennemans size principle. While this paradigm has considerable empirical support, a direct test requires simultaneous observations of many MUs across diverse force profiles. We developed an isometric task that allowed stable MU recordings even during rapidly changing forces. MU activity patterns were surprisingly behavior-dependent. MU activity could not be accurately described as reflecting common drive, but could be captured by assuming multiple drives. Neuropixels probe recordings revealed that, consistent with the requirements of flexible control, the motor cortex population response displays a great many degrees of freedom. Neighboring cortical sites recruited different MUs. Thus, MU activity is flexibly controlled to meet task demands, and cortex may contribute to this ability.",

MDICs interact with myeloid cells to promote their migration and stimulate the bacterial phagocytosis of macrophages and neutrophils by producing TNF and IL-6. CXCR4high MDICs egress circulation and infiltrate into the spleen, liver, and lung upon bacterial infection. Ablation of MKs suppresses the innate immune response and T cell activation to impair the anti-bacterial effects in mice under the Listeria monocytogenes challenge. Using hematopoietic stem/progenitor cell lineage-tracing mouse line, we show that MDICs are generated from infection-induced emergency megakaryopoiesis in response to bacterial infection. Overall, we identify MDICs as an MK subpopulation, which regulates host-defense immune response against bacterial infection.",

However, there is a gap in our knowledge of why replication origins in higher eukaryotes do not use a consensus DNA sequence as found in S.c.. Using in vitro reconstitution and single-molecule visualization, we show here that S.c. origin recognition complex (ORC) stably binds nucleosomes and that ORC-nucleosome complexes have the intrinsic ability to load the replicative helicase MCM double hexamers onto adjacent nucleosome-free DNA regardless of sequence. Furthermore, we find that Xenopus laevis nucleosomes can substitute for yeast ones in engaging with ORC. Combined with new analysis of genome-wide ORC binding, our results lead us to propose that the yeast origin recognition machinery contains the cryptic capacity to bind nucleosomes near a nucleosome-free region and license origins, and that this nucleosome-directed origin licensing paradigm generalizes to all eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "A mass extinction at the end of the Devonian is thought to have had a major influence on the evolution of actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes), which comprise half of living vertebrates. This extinction appears to have acted as a bottleneck, paring the early diversity of the group to a handful of survivors. Coupled with increases in taxonomic and morphological diversity in the Carboniferous, this contributes to a model of explosive post-extinction radiation. However, most actinopterygians from within a ~20-million-year (Myr) window surrounding the extinction remain poorly known, contributing to uncertainty about these patterns. An exceptionally preserved fossil of a diminutive fish from 7 Myr before the extinction reveals unexpected anatomical features that suggest a very different story. This new fossil nests within a clade of post-Devonian species and, in an expanded phylogenetic analysis, draws multiple lineages of Carboniferous actinopterygians into the Devonian. This suggests cryptic but extensive lineage diversification in the latest Devonian, followed by more conspicuous feeding and locomotor structure diversification in the Carboniferous. Our revised model matches more complex patterns of divergence, survival, and diversification around the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary in other vertebrate clades. It also fundamentally recalibrates the onset of diversification early in the history of this major radiation.",

We used a stimulus set of 128 images, optimized by a genetic algorithm to disentangle these five dimensions. The five dimensions explained much variance in the similarity judgments. Each dimension also explained a modest but significant amount of variance in the brain representations, except, surprisingly, \"being alive\". Different brain regions sensitive to animacy may represent distinct dimensions, either as accessible perceptual stepping stones toward detecting whether something is alive or because they are of behavioural importance in their own right.",

To elucidate these principles, we visualized the growth of dendrites throughout larval development of Drosophila sensory neurons and discovered that the tips of dendrites undergo dynamic instability, transitioning rapidly and stochastically between growing, shrinking, and paused states. By incorporating these measured dynamics into a novel, agent-based computational model, we showed that the complex and highly variable dendritic morphologies of these cells are a consequence of the stochastic dynamics of their dendrite tips. These principles may generalize to branching of other neuronal cell-types, as well as to branching at the subcellular and tissue levels.",

Estimates of the number of extant species range between 1.5 and 3.8 million8,9.

To date, many of the proposed relationships among the phyla remain controversial and no phylogenomic study has examined the entire fungal tree using a taxonomically comprehensive data set and suitable models of evolution. We assembled and curated a 299-protein data set with a taxon sampling broad enough to encompass all recognised fungal diversity with available data, but selective enough to run computationally intensive analyses using best-fitting models. Using a range of reconstruction methods, we were able to resolve many contested nodes, such as a sister-relationship of Chytridiomyceta to all other non-Opisthosporidia fungi (with Chytridiomycota being sister to Monoblepharomycota + Neocallimastigomycota), a branching of Blastocladiomycota + Sanchytriomycota after the Chytridiomyceta but before other non-Opisthosporidia fungi, and a branching of Glomeromycota as sister to the Dikarya.

    "abstract": "Microglia, the resident immune cell of the central nervous system (CNS), play a pivotal role in facilitating neurovascular development through mechanisms that are not fully understood. This current work resolves a previously unknown role for microglia in facilitating the developmental pruning of the astrocytic template resulting in a spatially organized retinal superficial vascular bed. Mechanistically, our study identified that local microglial expression of complement (C)3 and C3aR is necessary for the regulation of astrocyte patterning and vascular growth during retinal development. Ablation of retinal microglia and deficiency of C3 or C3aR reduced developmental pruning and clearance of astrocytic bodies leading to increased astrocyte density, altered vascular patterning, and elevated gene expression levels of extracellular matrix proteins involved in vascular growth during retinal development. These data demonstrate that C3/C3aR signaling is an important checkpoint required for the finetuning of vascular density during neuroretinal development.",

    "abstract": "With increasing sensitivity and accuracy in mass spectrometry, the tumor phosphoproteome is getting into reach. However, the selection of quantitation techniques best-suited to the biomedical question and diagnostic requirements remains a trial and error decision as no study has directly compared their performance for tumor tissue phosphoproteomics. We compared label-free quantification (LFQ), spike-in-SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) and TMT isobaric tandem mass tags technology for quantitative phosphosite profiling in tumor tissue. TMT offered the lowest accuracy and the highest precision and robustness towards different phosphosite abundances and matrices. Spike-in-SILAC offered the best compromise between these features but suffered from a low phosphosite coverage. LFQ offered the lowest precision but the highest number of identifications. Both spike-in-SILAC and LFQ presented susceptibility to matrix effects. Match between run (MBR)-based analysis enhanced the phosphosite coverage across technical replicates in LFQ and spike-in-SILAC but further reduced the precision and robustness of quantification. The choice of quantitative methodology is critical for both study design such as sample size in sample groups and quantified phosphosites, and comparison of published cancer phosphoproteomes. Using ovarian cancer tissue as an example, our study builds a resource for the design and analysis of quantitative phosphoproteomic studies in cancer research and diagnostics.",

    "abstract": "STAT5 is an essential transcriptional regulator of the sex-biased actions of growth hormone (GH) in the liver. Delivery of constitutively active STAT5 (STAT5CA) to male mouse liver using an engineered adeno-associated virus with high tropism for the liver is shown to induce widespread feminization of the liver, with extensive induction of female-biased genes and repression of male-biased genes, largely mimicking results obtained when male mice are given GH as a continuous infusion. Many of the gene expression changes observed were associated with STAT5 binding to liver chromatin, supporting the proposed direct role of persistently active STAT5 in continuous GH-induced liver feminization. The feminizing effects of STAT5CA were dose-dependent; moreover, at higher levels, overexpression of STAT5CA resulted in some histopathology not seen in continuous GH-infused male liver, including hepatocyte hyperplasia and distorted liver architecture. These findings establish that the persistent activation of STAT5 by GH that characterizes female liver is by itself sufficient to account for the female-biased expression of a majority of female-biased genes. Moreover, histological changes seen when STAT5CA is overexpressed highlight the importance of carefully evaluating such effects before considering such STAT5 derivatives for therapeutic use in treating liver disease.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanism of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) latent infection and reactivation in neurons requires the use of model systems. However, establishing a quiescent infection in cultured neurons is problematic as infectious virus released from any productively infected neuron can superinfect the cultures. Here, we describe a new reporter virus, HSV-1 Stayput-GFP, that is defective for cell-to-cell spread and can be used to model latency and reactivation at the single neuron level. Importantly, quiescent infection of neurons with Stayput-GFP can be established without the use of a viral DNA replication inhibitor. The establishment of a quiescent state requires a longer time frame than previous models of HSV latency using DNA replication inhibitors. This results in a decreased ability of the virus to reactivate, and the use of multiple reactivation triggers is required. Using this system, we demonstrate that an initial Phase I wave of lytic gene expression occurs independently of histone demethylase activity and viral DNA replication but is dependent on the neuronal cell stress protein, DLK. Progression into the later, Phase II wave of reactivation, characterized by detectable late viral protein synthesis and a requirement for histone demethylase activity, is also observed with the Stayput-GFP model system. These data demonstrate that the two waves of viral gene expression following HSV-1 reactivation are independent of secondary infection and occur when latent infections are established in the absence of a viral DNA replication inhibitor.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) enters a latent infection in neurons and periodically reactivates. Reactivation manifests as a variety of clinical symptoms. Studying latency and reactivation in vitro is invaluable, allowing the molecular mechanisms behind both processes to be targeted by therapeutics that reduce the clinical consequences. Here, we describe a novel in vitro model system using a cell-to-cell spread defective HSV-1, known as Stayput-GFP, which allows for the study of latency and reactivation at the single neuron level. We anticipate this new model system will be an incredibly valuable tool for studying the establishment and reactivation of HSV-1 latent infection in vitro. Using this model, we find that initial reactivation events are dependent on cellular stress kinase DLK, but independent of histone demethylase activity and viral DNA replication. Our data therefore demonstrate the essential role of DLK in mediating a wave of lytic gene expression unique to reactivation.",

    "abstract": "White matter of the fetal brain undergoes rapid development to form the early structural connections. Diffusion MRI has shown to be a useful tool to depict the fetal brain white matter in utero, and many studies have observed increasing fractional anisotropy and decreasing mean diffusivity in the fetal brain during the second-to-third trimester, whereas others reported non-monotonic changes. Unbiased diffusion MRI atlases of the fetal brain are important for characterizing developmental trajectories of white matter and providing normative references for in-utero diagnosis of prenatal abnormalities. To date, the sole fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas was collected from a Caucasian/mixed population, and was constructed based on the diffusion tensor model with limited spatial resolution.\n\nIn this work, we proposed a fiber orientation distribution (FOD) based pipeline for the generation of fetal brain diffusion MRI atlases, which showed better registration accuracy than diffusion tensor-based pipeline. Based on the FOD pipeline, we constructed the first Chinese fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas using 89 normal fetal diffusion MRI scans at GA between 24 and 38 weeks. Complex non-monotonic trends of tensor- and FOD-derived microstructural parameters in eight white matter tracts were observed, which jointly pointed to different phases of microstructural development. Specifically, we speculated that the turning point of the diffusivity trajectory may correspond to the starting point of pre-myelination, based on which, the developmental order of white matter tracts can be mapped and the order was in agreement with order of myelination from histological studies. The normative atlas also provided a reference for detection of abnormal white matter development, such as that in congenital heart disease. Therefore, the high-order fetal brain diffusion MRI atlas established in this study depicted the spatiotemporal pattern of early white matter development, and findings may help decipher the distinct microstructural events in utero.",

    "abstract": "Pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs) are common malignant brain tumors without effective treatment and poor patient survival. Abnormal posttranslational modification at the histone H3 tail plays critical roles in tumor cell malignancy. We have previously shown that trimethylation of lysine 4 at histone H3 (H3K4me3) plays a significant role in pediatric ependymoma malignancy and is associated with tumor therapeutic sensitivity. Here, we show that H3K4me3 and its methyltransferase WDR82 are elevated in pHGGs. Reduction of H3K4me3 by downregulating WDR82 decreases H3K4me3 promoter occupancy and expression of genes associated with stem cell features, cell proliferation, the cell cycle and DNA damage repair. Reduction of WDR82 mediated H3K4me3 increases the response of pediatric glioma cells to chemotherapy. These findings suggest that WDR82 mediated H3K4me3 is an important determinant of pediatric glioma malignancy and therapeutic response. This highlights the need for a more thorough understanding of the potential of WDR82 as an epigenetic target to increase therapeutic efficacy and improve prognosis for children with malignant gliomas.",

    "abstract": "The rufa Red Knot (Calidris canutus rufa) is a migratory shorebird that performs one of the longest known migrations of any bird species -- from their breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic to their nonbreeding grounds as far south as Tierra del Fuego -- and has experienced a population decline of over 85% in recent decades. During migration, knots rest and refuel at stopover sites along the Atlantic Coast, including Kiawah and Seabrook islands in South Carolina. Here, we document the importance of Kiawah and Seabrook islands for knots by providing population and stopover estimates during their spring migration. We conducted on-the-ground surveys between 19 February - 20 May 2021 to record the occurrence of individually marked knots. In addition, we quantified the ratio of marked to unmarked knots and deployed geolocators on knots captured in the area. Using a superpopulation model, we estimated a minimum passage population of 17,247 knots (~41% of the total rufa knot population) and an average stopover duration of 47 days. Our geolocator results also showed that knots using Kiawah and Seabrook islands can bypass Delaware Bay and fly directly to the Canadian Arctic. Finally, our geolocators, combined with resighting data from across the Atlantic Flyway, indicate that a large network of more than 70 coastal sites mostly concentrated along the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina provide stopover and overwintering habitat for the knots we observed on Kiawah and Seabrook islands. These findings corroborate that Kiawah and Seabrook islands should be recognized as critical sites in the knot network and, therefore, a conservation priority. As a result, the threats facing the sites -- such as prey management issues, anthropogenic disturbance, and sea level rise -- require immediate attention.",

    "abstract": "Characterizing spatial patterns in allele frequencies is fundamental to evolutionary biology because such patterns can inform on underlying processes. However, the spatial scales at which changing selection, gene flow, and drift act are often unknown. Many of these processes can operate inconsistently across space (causing non-stationary patterns). We present a wavelet approach to characterize spatial pattern in genotype that helps solve these problems. We show how our approach can characterize spatial patterns in ancestry at multiple spatial scales, i.e. a multi-locus wavelet genetic dissimilarity. We also develop wavelet tests of spatial differentiation in allele frequency and quantitative trait loci (QTL). With simulation we illustrate these methods under a variety of scenarios. We apply our approach to natural populations of Arabidopsis thaliana and traditional varieties of Sorghum bicolor to characterize population structure and locally-adapted loci across scales. We find, for example, that Arabidopsis flowering time QTL show significantly elevated scaled wavelet variance at [~] 300 - 1300 km scales. Wavelet transforms of population genetic data offer a flexible way to reveal geographic patterns and underlying processes.\n\nAuthor summaryBiologists can learn about evolutionary processes by studying spatial/geographic changes in the genotype of organisms in nature. However, many previous approaches to measure spatial genetic patterns have been limited by forcing individual samples into bins of discrete size and location, hindering our ability to learn about evolution. Here we present a new continuous approach to spatial genetics that allows us to resolve patterns that change in space and opposing patterns that occur at different spatial scales.",

While the surface area increases with volume as SA ~ V{gamma} the scaling exponent for proportional growth maintaining the shape and aspect is {gamma} ~ 2/3 or 0.66. However most well-studied cellular systems deviate from this standard exponent. At the same time, a mechanism that could predict the biological or physical basis of these scaling relations remains unclear. Here, we quantify the surface area scaling with volume of Escherichia coli cells with varying growth rates and under different conditions and find the scaling exponent varies from {gamma} ~ 0.7 to 0.9. A model of uncorrelated statistical variation of cell lengths and widths can reproduce the exponent observed in experiment. Average values of length and width on the other hand results in an impression of  ideal geometric scaling, as reported in some studies. Experimental data however suggests that E. coli cell width is strongly correlated with length and a model of saturation best explains the observations. We hypothesize this model of cell size and shape regulation could serve the function of optimizing flux of nutrients, within the constraints of the cell division machinery.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is both an environmental saprobe and an opportunistic human fungal pathogen. Knowledge of genomic variation across A. fumigatus isolates is essential for understanding the evolution of pathogenicity, virulence, and resistance to antifungal drugs. Here, we investigated 206 A. fumigatus isolates (133 clinical and 73 environmental isolates) aiming to identify genes with variable presence across isolates and test whether this variation was related to the clinical or environmental origin of isolates. The PanCore genome of A. fumigatus constitutes 13,085 ortholog groups, of which 7,773 (59.4%) are shared by all isolates (CORE) and 5,312 (40.6%) vary in their gene presence across isolates (ACCESSORY). Despite differences in the distribution of orthologs across all isolates, no significant differences were observed among clinical vs. environmental isolates when accounting for phylogeny. Orthologs that differ in their distribution across isolates tend to occur in low frequency and/or be restricted to specific isolates; thus, the degree of genomic conservation between orthologs of A. fumigatus is high. These results suggest that differences in the distribution of orthologs within A. fumigatus cannot be associated with the clinical or environmental origin of isolates.\n\nImportanceAspergillus fumigatus is a cosmopolitan species of fungi responsible for thousands of cases of invasive disease. Clinical and environmental isolates of A. fumigatus exhibit extensive phenotypic differences, including differences related to virulence and antifungal drug resistance. A comprehensive survey of the genomic diversity present in A. fumigatus and its relationship to the clinical or environmental origin of isolates can contribute to the prediction of the mechanisms of evolution and infection of the species. Our results suggest that there is no significant variation in ortholog distribution between clinical and environmental isolates when accounting for evolutionary history.

Excluding therapeutic antibodies, few hybridoma-derived antibody sequences are known. Sanger sequencing has been \"the gold standard\" for antibody gene sequencing but relies on the availability of species-specific degenerate primer sets for amplification of light and heavy antibody genes, in addition to lengthy and expensive cDNA preparation.

When compared to Sanger sequencing of two hybridoma cell lines, long-read ONT sequencing was highly accurate, reliable, and amenable to high throughput. We further show that the method is applicable to single cells, allowing efficient antibody discovery in rare populations such as memory B cells. In summary, NAb-seq promises to accelerate identification and validation of hybridoma antibodies as well as antibodies from single B cells used in research, diagnostics and therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Solving the problems that replication forks encounter when synthesizing DNA is essential to prevent genomic instability. Besides their role in DNA repair in the G2 phase, several homologous recombination proteins, specifically Rad51, have prominent roles in the S phase. Using different cellular models, Rad51 has been shown not only to be present at ongoing and arrested replication forks but also to be involved in nascent DNA protection and replication fork restart. Through pharmacological inhibition, here we study the specific role of Rad51 in the S phase. Rad51 inhibition in non-transformed cell lines did not have a major effect on replication fork progression under non-perturbed conditions, but when the same cells were subjected to replication stress, Rad51 became necessary to maintain replication fork progression. Notably, the inhibition or depletion of Rad51 did not compromise fork integrity when subjected to hydroxyurea treatment. Rad51 inhibition also did not decrease the ability to restart, but rather compromised, fork progression during reinitiation. In agreement with the presence of basal replication stress in human colorectal cancer cells, Rad51 inhibition reduced replication fork speed in these cells and increased {gamma}H2Ax foci under control conditions. These alterations could have resulted from the reduced association of DNA polymerase  to chromatin, as observed when inhibiting Rad51. It may be possible to exploit the differential dependence of non-transformed cells versus colorectal cancer cells on Rad51 activity under basal conditions to design new therapies that specifically target cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Difficulties in social interactions are common to both autism and schizophrenia, and contribute to correlated autistic and schizotypal traits in the neurotypical population. It remains unresolved whether this represents a shared etiology or a superficial phenotypic overlap. Both conditions are associated with atypical neural activity in response to the perception of social stimuli, and also decreased neural synchronization between individuals that may prohibit establishing shared experiences. This study sought to establish if neural activity and neural synchronization associated with biological motion perception are differentially associated with autistic and schizotypal traits in the neurotypical population. Participants watched an audiovisual montage of naturalistic social interactions whilst hemodynamic brain activity was measured with fMRI. A separate sample of participants provided a continuous measure of the extent of biological motion, which was used to predict hemodynamic activity. General Linear Model analysis revealed that biological motion perception was associated with neural activity across the action-observation network. However, inter-subject phase synchronization analysis revealed that neural activity synchronized between individuals in occipital and parietal areas, but de-synchronized in temporal and frontal regions. Autistic traits were associated with a decrease in neural activity (precuneus, middle cingulate gyrus) and schizotypal traits were associated with a decrease in neural synchronization (middle and inferior frontal gyri). Biological motion perception elicits convergent and divergent patterns of neural activity and neural synchronization, and are differentially associated with shared traits related with autism and schizophrenia in the general population, suggesting that they originate from different neural mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "It is widely assumed that our actions shape our brains and that the resulting connections determine who we are. To test this idea in a reductionist setting, in which genes and environment are controlled, we investigated differences in neuroanatomy and structural covariance by ex vivo structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mice whose behavioral activity was continuously tracked for 3 months in a large, enriched environment. We confirmed that environmental enrichment increases mouse hippocampal volumes. Stratifying the enriched group according to individual longitudinal behavioral trajectories, however, revealed striking differences in mouse brain structural covariance in continuously highly active mice compared to those whose trajectories showed signs of habituating activity. Network-based statistics identified distinct sub-networks of murine structural covariance underlying these differences in behavioral activity. Together, these results reveal that differentiated behavioral trajectories of mice in an enriched environment are associated with differences in brain connectivity.",

    "abstract": "Human agents build models of their environment, which enable them to anticipate and plan upcoming events. However, little is known about the properties of such predictive models. Recently, it has been proposed that hippocampal representations take the form of a predictive map-like structure, the so-called successor representation. Here we used human fMRI to probe whether activity in the early visual cortex (V1) and hippocampus adhere to the postulated properties of the successor representation after visual sequence learning. Participants were exposed to an arbitrary spatiotemporal sequence consisting of four items (A-B-C-D). We found that after repeated exposure to the sequence, merely presenting single sequence items (e.g., - B - -) resulted in V1 activation at the successor locations of the full sequence (e.g., C-D), but not at the predecessor locations (e.g., A). This highlights that visual representations are skewed toward future states, in line with the successor representation. Similar results were also found in the hippocampus. Moreover, the hippocampus developed a tuning profile that showed sensitivity to the temporal distance in sequence-space, with fading representations for sequence events in the more distant past and future. V1, in contrast, showed a tuning profile that was only sensitive to spatial distance in stimulus-space. Together, these results provide empirical evidence for the proposition that both visual and hippocampal cortex represent a predictive map of the visual world akin to the successor representation.",

    "abstract": "Language is fundamentally predictable, both on a higher schematic level as well as low-level lexical items. Regarding predictability on a lexical level, collocations are frequent co-occurrences of words that are often characterized by high strength of association. So far, psycho-and neurolin guistic studies have mostly employed highly artificial experimental paradigms in the investigation of collocations by focusing on the processing of single words or isolated sentences. In contrast, here we analyze EEG brain responses recorded during stimulation with continuous speech, i.e. audio books. We find that the N400 response to collocations is significantly different from that of non-collocations, whereas the effect varies with respect to cortical region (anterior/ posterior) and laterality (left/right). Our results are in line with studies using continuous speech, and they mostly contradict those using artificial paradigms and stimuli. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first neurolinguistic study on collocations using continuous speech stimulation.",

    "abstract": "Expanding whole blood sample collection for transcriptome analysis beyond traditional phlebotomy clinics will open new frontiers for remote immune research and telemedicine. Determining the stability of RNA in blood samples exposed to high ambient temperatures (>30{degrees}C) is necessary for deploying home-sampling in settings with elevated temperatures (e.g., studying physiological response to natural disasters that occur in warm locations or in the summer). Recently, we have developed homeRNA, a technology that allows for self-blood sampling and RNA stabilization remotely. homeRNA consists of a lancet-based blood collection device, the Tasso-SST which collects up to 0.5 mL of blood from the upper arm, and a custom-built stabilization transfer tube containing RNAlater. In this study, we investigated the robustness of our homeRNA kit in high temperature settings via two small pilot studies in Doha, Qatar (no. participants = 8), and the Western and South Central USA during the summer of 2021, which included a heatwave of unusually high temperatures in some locations (no. participants = 11). Samples collected from participants in Doha were subjected to rapid external temperature fluctuations from being moved to and from air-conditioned areas and extreme heat environments (up to 41{degrees}C external temperature during brief temperature spikes). In the USA pilot study, regions varied in outdoor temperature highs (between 25{degrees}C and 43.4{degrees}C). All samples that returned a RNA integrity number (RIN) value from the Doha, Qatar group had a RIN [&ge;]7.0, a typical integrity threshold for downstream transcriptomics analysis. RIN values for the Western and South Central USA samples (n=12 samples) ranged from 6.9-8.7 with 9 out of 12 samples reporting RINs [&ge;]7.0. Overall, our pilot data suggest that homeRNA can be used in some regions that experience elevated temperatures, opening up new geographical frontiers in disseminated transcriptome analysis for applications critical to telemedicine, global health, and expanded clinical research. Further studies, including our ongoing work in Qatar, USA, and Thailand, will continue to test the robustness of homeRNA.",

We performed proteomic analyses of untreated and IFN{gamma}-treated colorectal cancer patient-derived organoids (PDOs) and combined this with transcriptomic and HLA-I immunopeptidomics data to dissect mechanisms that lead to remodeling of the immunopeptidome through IFN{gamma}. IFN{gamma}-induced changes in the abundance of source proteins, switching from the constitutive- to the immunoproteasome, and differential upregulation of different HLA alleles explained some, but not all, observed peptide abundance changes. By selecting for peptides which increased or decreased the most in abundance, but originated from proteins with limited abundance changes, we discovered that the amino acid composition of presented peptides also influences whether a peptide is up- or downregulated on HLA-I through IFN{gamma}. The presence of proline within the peptide core was most strongly associated with peptide downregulation. This was validated in an independent dataset. Proline substitution in relevant core positions did not influence the predicted HLA-I binding affinity or stability, indicating that proline effects on peptide processing may be most relevant. Understanding the multiple factors that influence the abundance of peptides presented on HLA-I in the absence or presence of IFN{gamma} is important to identify the best targets for antigen-specific cancer immunotherapies such as vaccines or T-cell receptor engineered therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Increasing current interest in sponge fossils includes numerous reports of diverse vermicular and peloidal structures interpreted as keratose sponges in Neoproterozoic to Mesozoic carbonates and in various open marine to peritidal and restricted settings. Reports of their occurrence are fundamental and far-reaching for understanding microfacies and diagenesis where they occur; and fossil biotic assemblages, as well as wider aspects of origins of animals, sponge evolution/ecology and the systemic recovery from mass extinctions. Keratose sponges: 1) have elaborate spongin skeletons but no spicules, thus lack mineral parts and therefore have poor preservation potential so that determining their presence in rocks requires interpretation; and 2) are presented in publications as interpreted fossil structures almost entirely in two-dimensional (thin section) studies, where structures claimed as sponges comprise diverse layered, network, particulate and amalgamated fabrics involving calcite sparite in a micritic groundmass. There is no verification of sponges in these cases and almost all of them can be otherwise explained; some are certainly not correctly identified. The diversity of structures seen in thin sections may be reinterpreted to include: a) meiofaunal activity; b) layered, possibly microbial (spongiostromate) accretion; c) sedimentary peloidal to clotted micrites; d) fluid escape and capture resulting in birdseye to vuggy porosities; and e) molds of siliceous sponge spicules. Without confirmation of keratose sponges in ancient carbonates, interpretations of their role in ancient carbonate systems, including facies directly after mass extinctions, are unsafe, and alternative explanations for such structures should be considered. This study calls for greater critical appraisal of evidence, to seek confirmation or not, of keratose sponge presence. (259/300 max, for Sedimentology)",

In an attempt to generate a Cre-dependently restorable ER-null mice for functional investigation of the genetic sufficiency, we unexpectedly produced ER hypomorphic mice with biased downregulation of a previously unappreciated long ER isoform that is enriched in the female reproductive organs (uterus and ovaries) and the pituitary but minimally expressed in the brain. Female homozygous mutant mice were capable of pregnancy but displayed irregular estrus cycle and rarely maintained alive newborns without significant morphological and pathological changes in reproductive system and the disruption of body weight homeostasis, indicating the vital role of this long isoform in female reproductive function.

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas13 proteins are RNA-guided RNA nucleases that defend against invasive phages through general, non-specific RNA degradation upon complementary target transcript binding. Despite being RNA nucleases, Cas13 effectors are capable of inhibiting the infection of dsDNA phages but have only been investigated across a relatively small sampling of phage diversity. Here, we employ a systematic, phage-centric approach to determine the anti-phage capacity of Cas13 and find LbuCas13a to be a remarkably potent phage inhibitor. LbuCas13a confers robust, consistent antiviral activity regardless of gene essentiality, gene expression timing or target sequence location. Furthermore, after challenging LbuCas13a with eight diverse E. coli phages distributed across E. coli phage phylogenetic groups, we find no apparent phage-encoded limits to its potent antiviral activity. In contrast to other Class 2 CRISPR-Cas proteins, these results suggest that DNA phages are generally vulnerable to Cas13a targeting. Leveraging this effective anti-phage activity, LbuCas13a can be used seamlessly as a counter-selection agent for broad-spectrum phage editing. Using a two-step phage editing and enrichment approach, we show that LbuCas13a enables markerless genome edits in phages with exceptionally high efficiency and precision, including edits as small as a single codon. By taking advantage of the broad vulnerability of RNA during viral infection, Cas13a enables a generalizable strategy for editing the most abundant and diverse biological entities on Earth.",

    "abstract": "Flagellar structural subunits are transported via the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) and assemble at the distal end of the growing flagellar structure. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of FlhA (FlhAC) serves as a docking platform for export substrates and flagellar chaperones and plays an important role in hierarchical protein targeting and export. FlhAC consists of domains D1, D2, D3, and D4 and adopts open and closed conformations. Gly-368 of Salmonella FlhA is located within the highly conserved GYXLI motif and is critical for the dynamic domain motions of FlhAC. However, it remains unclear how it works. Here, we report that periodic conformational changes of the GYXLI motif induce a remodeling of hydrophobic side-chain interaction networks in FlhAC and promotes the cyclic open-close domain motions of FlhAC. The temperature- sensitive flhA(G368C) mutation stabilized a completely closed conformation at 42{degrees}C through strong hydrophobic interactions between Gln-498 of domain D1 and Pro-667 of domain D4 and between Phe-459 of domain D2 and Pro-646 of domain D4, thereby inhibiting flagellar protein export by the fT3SS. Its intragenic suppressor mutations reorganized the hydrophobic interaction networks in the closed FlhAC structure, restoring the protein export activity of the fT3SS to a significant degree. Furthermore, the conformational flexibility of the GYXLI motif was critical for flagellar protein export. We propose that the conserved GYXLI motif acts as a structural switch to induce the dynamic domain motions of FlhAC required for efficient and rapid protein export by the fT3SS.\n\nIMPORTANCEMany motile bacteria employ the flagellar type III secretion system (fT3SS) to construct flagella beyond the cytoplasmic membrane. The C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of FlhA (FlhAC), a transmembrane subunit of the fT3SS, provides binding-sites for export substrates and flagellar export chaperones to coordinate flagellar protein export with assembly. FlhAC undergoes cyclic open- close domain motions. The highly conserved Gly-368 residue of FlhA is postulated to be critical for dynamic domain motions of FlhAC. However, it remains unknown how it works. Here, we carried out mutational analysis of FlhAC combined with molecular dynamics simulation and provide evidence that the conformational flexibility of FlhAC by Gly-368 is important for remodeling hydrophobic side-chain interaction networks in FlhAC to facilitate its cyclic open-close domain motions, allowing the fT3SS to transport flagellar structural subunits for efficient and rapid flagellar assembly.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is one of the most prevalent human fungal pathogens. Its ability to transition between budding yeast and filamentous morphological forms (pseudohyphae and hyphae) is tightly associated with its pathogenesis. Based on in vitro studies, the cAMP-Protein Kinase A (PKA) pathway is a key regulator of C. albicans morphogenesis. Using an intravital imaging approach, we investigated the role of the cAMP-PKA pathway during infection. Consistent with their roles in vitro, the downstream effectors of the cAMP-PKA pathway Efg1 and Nrg1 function, respectively, as an activator and a repressor of in vivo filamentation. Surprisingly, strains lacking the adenylyl cyclase, CYR1, showed only slightly reduced filamentation in vivo despite being completely unable to filament in RPMI+10% serum at 37{degrees}C. Consistent with these findings, deletion of the catalytic subunits of PKA (Tpk1 and Tpk2), either singly or in combination, generated strains that also filamented in vivo but not in vitro. In vivo transcription profiling of C. albicans isolated from both ear and kidney tissue showed that the expression of a set of 184 environmentally responsive correlated well with in vitro filamentation (R2 0.62-0.68) genes. This concordance suggests that the in vivo and in vitro transcriptional responses are similar but that the upstream regulatory mechanisms are distinct. As such, these data emphatically emphasize that C. albicans filamentation is a complex phenotype that occurs in different environments through an intricate network of distinct regulatory mechanisms.\n\nImportanceThe fungus Candida albicans causes a wide range of disease in humans from common diaper rash to life-threatening infections in patients with compromised immune systems. As such, the mechanisms for its ability to cause disease are of wide interest. An intensely studied virulence property of C. albicans is its ability to switch from a round yeast form to filament-like forms (hyphae and pseudohyphae). Surprisingly, we have found that a key signaling pathway that regulates this transition in vitro, the protein kinase A pathway, is not required for filamentation during infection of the host. Our work not only demonstrates that the regulation of filamentation depends upon the specific environment C. albicans inhabits but also underscores the importance of studying these mechanisms during infection.",

The mechanisms by which they establish and maintain this relationship are not yet fully understood. The transcriptomes of the epibiont TM7x and its host bacteria Schaalia odontolyticus strain XH001 were captured across the establishment of symbiosis during both the initial interaction and stable symbiosis. The results showed a dynamic interaction with large shifts in gene expression for both species between the initial encounter and stable symbiosis, notably transporter genes. During stable symbiosis, the host XH001 showed higher gene expression for peptidoglycan biosynthesis, mannosylation, cell cycle and stress related genes, but lower expression of chromosomal partitioning genes. This was consistent with the elongated cell shape seen in XH001 infected with TM7x and our discovery that infection resulted in thickened cell walls. Within TM7x, increased pili, type IV effector gene, and arginine catabolism/biosynthesis gene expression during stable symbiosis implied a key role for these functions in the interaction. Consistent with its survival and persistence in the human microbiome as an obligate epibiont with reduced de novo biosynthetic capacities, TM7x also showed higher levels for energy production and peptidoglycan biosynthesis but lower expression of stress related genes during stable symbiosis. These results imply that TM7x and its host bacteria keep a delicate balance in order to sustain an episymbiotic lifestyle.\n\nIMPORTANCENanosynbacter lyticus type strain TM7x is the first cultivated member of the Saccharibacteria and the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR). It was discovered to have ultrasmall cell size with a highly reduced genome that establishes an obligate epibiotic relationship with its host bacterium. The CPR, now formally proposed as the Patescibacteria super-phylum, is a large monophyletic radiation of diverse bacteria with reduced genomes that includes Saccharibacteria. The vast majority of the CPR have yet to be cultivated in the laboratory and our insights into these unique organisms to date has been derived from only a few Saccharibacteria species. It is unknown however how these small obligate parasitic Saccharibacteria, that are missing many de novo biosynthetic pathways, are maintained at high prevalence within the human microbiome as well as in the environment. When TM7x infects its host bacterium there are distinct temporal phases, including an initial interaction, a killing phase, recovery phase, and finally stable symbiosis. Here we captured the gene expression of the host bacterium and epibiont during this dynamic interaction which represents the initial insights into the mechanisms of how these unique microbes may survive and persist.",

    "abstract": "Lactobacillus acidophilus has been extensively applied in plentiful probiotic products and is mostly found in the gastrointestinal tract, vagina, and oral cavity of human and animal, and fermented foods. Although several studies have been performed to investigate the beneficial characteristics and genome function of L. acidophilus, comparative genomic analysis remains scarce. In this study, we collected 74 L. acidophilus genomes from our gut bacterial genome collection and the public database and conducted a comprehensive comparative genomic analysis. The analysis of average nucleotide identity (ANI), phylogenetic, gene distribution of COG and KEGG database, carbohydrates utilization, and secondary metabolites revealed the potential correlation of the genomic diversity and niches adaptation of L. acidophilus from different perspectives. In addition, the pan-genome of L. acidophilus was found to be open, with metabolism, information storage and processing genes mainly distributed in the core genome. Phage- and peptidase-associated genes were found in the genome of the specificity of animal-derived strains, which were related to adaptation of animal gut. SNP analysis showed the differences of the utilization of Vitamin B12 in cellular of L. acidophilus strains from animal gut and others. This work provides new insights for the genomic diversity analysis of Lactobacillus acidophilus and uncovers the ecological adaptation of the specific strains.",

    "abstract": "Calcineurin is an essential virulence factor that is conserved across human fungal pathogens including Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Candida albicans. Although an excellent target for antifungal drug development, the serine-threonine phosphatase activity of calcineurin is conserved in mammals and inhibition of this activity results in immunosuppression. FK506 (tacrolimus) is a naturally produced macrocyclic compound that inhibits calcineurin by binding to the immunophilin FKBP12. Previously, our fungal calcineurin-FK506-FKBP12 structure-based approaches identified a non-conserved region of FKBP12 that can be exploited for fungal-specific targeting. These studies led to the design of an FK506 analog, APX879, modified at the C22 position that was less immunosuppressive yet maintained antifungal activity. We now report high resolution protein crystal structures of fungal FKBP12 and a human truncated calcineurin-FKBP12 bound to a natural FK506 analog, FK520 (ascomycin). Based on information from these structures and the success of APX879, we synthesized and screened a novel panel of C22-modified compounds derived from both FK506 and FK520. One compound, JH-FK-05 demonstrates broad-spectrum antifungal activity in vitro and is non-immunosuppressive in vivo. In murine models of pulmonary and disseminated C. neoformans infection, JH-FK-05 treatment significantly reduced fungal burden and extended animal survival alone and in combination with fluconazole. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations performed with JH-FK-05 binding to fungal and human FKBP12 identified additional residues outside of the C22 and C21 positions that could be modified to generate novel FK506 analogs with improved antifungal activity.\n\nSignificanceDue to rising rates of antifungal drug resistance and a limited armamentarium of antifungal treatments, there is a paramount need for novel antifungal drugs to treat systemic fungal infections. Calcineurin has been established as an essential and conserved virulence factor in several fungi, making it an attractive antifungal target. However, due to the immunosuppressive action of calcineurin inhibitors, they have not been successfully utilized clinically for antifungal treatment in humans. Recent availability of crystal structures of fungal calcineurin bound inhibitor complexes have enabled the structure-guided design of FK506 analogs and led to a breakthrough in the development of a compound increased for fungal specificity. The development of a calcineurin inhibitor with reduced immunosuppressive activity and therapeutic antifungal activity would add a significant tool to the treatment options for these invasive fungal infections with exceedingly high rates of mortality.",

    "abstract": "Drug development based on target proteins has been a successful approach in recent decades. A conventional structure-based drug design pipeline is a complex, human-engineered pipeline with multiple independently optimized steps. Advances in end-to-end differentiable learning suggest the potential benefits of similarly reformulating drug design. Here, we proposed a new sequence-to-drug paradigm that discovers drug-like small-molecule modulators directly from protein sequences and validated this concept for the first time in three stages. First, we designed TransformerCPI2.0 as a core tool for the sequence-to-drug paradigm, which exhibited competitive performance with conventional structure-based drug design approaches. Second, we validated the binding knowledge that TransformerCPI2.0 has learned. Third, we applied a sequence-to-drug paradigm to discover new hits for E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases: speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP), ring finger protein 130 (RNF130) which does not have a 3D structure, and repurposed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) for ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1). This first proof of concept shows that the sequence-to-drug paradigm is a promising direction for drug development.",

    "abstract": "Upon axonal injury, Sterile alpha (SAM) and Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) motif containing 1 (SARM1) is activated by nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) to deplete NAD and consequently promote the process of axon degeneration (AxD). Currently, only the inactive form of SARM1 in its auto-inhibitory conformation has been resolved. The flexibility of the enzymatically active form of SARM1 has so far precluded its structural determination. To solve the problem, we generated a stabilizing nanobody, Nb-C6, that specifically recognized only the NMN-activated form of SARM1. The conformation specificity was verified by immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance. Fluorescently labeled Nb-C6 could immunostain only the activated SARM1 in cells stimulated with CZ-48, a permeant mimetic of NMN. Expression of Nb-C6 in live cells resulted in stabilization of the active form of the endogenous and exogenous SARM1, producing and elevating cellular levels of cyclic ADP-ribose, a calcium messenger. Cryo-EM of the NMN-activated SARM1 complexed by Nb-C6 showed an octameric structure resembling a \"blooming lotus\" with the ARM domains bending significantly inward and swinging out together with the TIR domains to form the \"petals of the lotus\". Nb-C6 bound to the SAM domain of the activated SARM1 and stabilized its Armadillo repeat motif domain. Analyses using hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS), and cross-linking MS (XL-MS) indicate that the activated SARM1 is highly dynamic and flexible and the neighboring TIRs form dimers via the surface close to one BB loop. The Nanobody is thus a valuable tool for delineating the mechanism of activation of SARM1 in AxD and other cellular processes.",

While hypoxia inactivates prolyl-4 hydroxylase domain containing proteins 1-3 (PHD1-3) and stabilizes hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs) stimulating angiogenesis, the effects of PHDs on EC functions remain unclear. Here, we investigated the impact of PHD inhibition by dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) on angiogenic competence and metabolism of human vascular ECs. PHD inhibition reduced EC proliferation, migration, and tube formation capacities. Furthermore, transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed an unfavorable metabolic reprogramming for angiogenesis following treatment with DMOG. Despite the induction of glycolytic genes and high levels of lactate, multiple genes encoding sub-units of mitochondrial complex I were suppressed with concurrent decline in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels. Importantly, defective EC migration due to DMOG could be partially restored by augmenting NAD+ levels. Combined, our data provide metabolic insights into the mechanism by which chemical PHD inhibition impairs angiogenic competence of human vascular ECs.",

    "abstract": "Lambdoid bacteriophage Q proteins are transcription antipausing and antitermination factors that enable RNA polymerase (RNAP) to read through pause and termination sites. Q proteins load onto RNAP engaged in promoter-proximal pausing at a Q binding element (QBE) and adjacent sigma-dependent pause element to yield a Q-loading complex, and translocate with RNAP as a pausing-deficient, termination-deficient Q-loaded complex. In previous work, we showed that the Q protein from bacteriophage 21 (Q21) functions by forming a \"nozzle\" that narrows and extends the RNAP RNA-exit channel, preventing formation of pause and termination RNA hairpins. Here, we report atomic structures of four states on the pathway of antitermination by the Q protein from bacteriophage {lambda} (Q{lambda}), a Q protein that shows no sequence similarity to Q21 and that, unlike Q21, requires the transcription elongation factor NusA for efficient antipausing and antitermination. We report structures of Q{lambda}, the Q{lambda}-QBE complex, the NusA-free \"pre-engaged\" Q{lambda}-loading complex, and the NusA-containing \"engaged\" Q{lambda}-loading complex. The results show that Q{lambda}, like Q21, forms a nozzle that narrows and extends the RNAP RNA-exit channel, preventing formation of RNA hairpins. However, the results show that Q{lambda} has no three-dimensional structural similarity to Q21, employs a different mechanism of QBE recognition than Q21, and employs a more complex process for loading onto RNAP than Q21, involving recruitment of Q{lambda} to form a \"pre-engaged\" loading complex, followed by NusA-facilitated refolding of Q{lambda} to form an \"engaged\" loading complex. The results establish Q{lambda} and Q21 are not structural homologs and are solely functional analogs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTBacteriophage Q proteins are textbook examples of regulators of gene expression that function at the level of transcription antitermination. Here, we report structures defining the mechanism of antitermination by the Q protein of bacteriophage {lambda} (Q{lambda}). The results show Q{lambda} forms a \"nozzle\" that narrows and extends the RNA polymerase RNA-exit channel, precluding the formation of terminator RNA hairpins. The results show Q{lambda} exhibits no structural similarity to the Q protein of bacteriophage 21 (Q21), employs a different mechanism for DNA binding than Q21, and employs a more complex process of loading onto RNA polymerase than Q21.

Using individual-based interactions of a super-generalist fleshy-fruited plant with its frugivore assemblage we estimate the Resource Provisioning Effectiveness (RPE) and Seed Dispersal Effectiveness (SDE) to assess the balance in the exchange of resources. Plants were highly dependent on a few super-generalist frugivore species, while these interacted with most individual plants, resulting in strong asymmetries in mutual dependence. Both RPE and SDE were mainly driven by interaction frequency. Despite highly asymmetric dependences, the strong reliance on quantity largely determined high reciprocity in rewards between partners (i.e., higher energy provided, more seedlings recruited), not obscured by minor variations in the quality of animal or plant service. We anticipate reciprocity will emerge in low-intimacy mutualisms where the mutualistic outcome largely relies upon interaction frequency.",

We also identified 234 new species descriptions in 20 biodiversity hotspots reporting impacts from mining. Temporal trends in the assessments highlight the increased saliency of this threat to biodiversity, whose full extent may well reach over 24,000 animal and plant species.

    "abstract": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is an important staple crop throughout much of the world, however, it is also a significant source of agricultural methane (CH4) emissions and exposure to arsenic (As). Introduction of soil aerobic events through practices such as alternate wetting and drying or midseason drainage, in flooded rice systems can significantly decrease grain As concentration and seasonal CH4 emissions. Previous on small research plots research has shown that a single midseason drain accomplishes these goals without yield reduction, but the degree of benefit depends on soil-drying severity. A midseason drain also has the potential to fit in well within current management practices of California rice systems, however, it has not been tested across a wide range of soil types or at a scale that farmers typically manage in this region. Therefore, in this three-year study, we aimed to determine if the results from previous small plot research are similar to what can be expected on-farm. At seven on-farm trials we implemented a single midseason drain and compared the grain yields, GHG emissions, and As concentration to the traditional farmer practice (FP) practiced in an adjacent part of the field. Soil moisture parameters [perched water table, volumetric water content, gravimetric water content (GWC), and soil water potential], CH4 and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, grain As and cadmium concentration, and grain yield were quantified. Across site-years, midseason drainage reduced seasonal CH4 emissions by 20-77%, compared to the FP control with the magnitude of reduction related to the soil-drying severity. For every 1% reduction in soil GWC during the drainage period, CH4 emissions were reduced by approximately 3.2%, compared to 2.5% in previous on-station research using small plots. Midseason drainage increased N2O emissions (average = 0.248 kg N2O-N ha-1) compared to the control but this accounted for only 3% of the seasonal global warming potential across all drainage treatments. Drainage also decreased grain As concentration by approximately 20%, on average, but was not related to the degree of soil-drying. Importantly, midseason drainage had no significant impact on grain yields. Overall, these results confirm findings from previous on-station research, indicating that midseason drainage may be a viable on-farm management practice for GHG mitigation and for reducing grain As concentration in flooded rice fields with limited risk of yield reduction.",

    "abstract": "SUMMARYThe ATP-dependent ring-shaped chaperonin TRiC/CCT is essential for cellular proteostasis. To uncover why some eukaryotic proteins can only fold with TRiC assistance, we reconstituted the folding of {beta}-tubulin using human Prefoldin and TRiC. We find unstructured {beta}-tubulin is delivered by Prefoldin to the open TRiC chamber followed by ATP-dependent chamber closure. CryoEM resolves four near-atomic resolution structures containing progressively folded {beta}-tubulin intermediates within the closed TRiC chamber, culminating in native tubulin. This substrate folding pathway appears closely guided by site-specific interactions with conserved regions in the TRiC chamber. Initial electrostatic interactions between the TRiC interior wall and both the folded tubulin N-domain and its C-terminal E-hook tail establish the native substrate topology, thus enabling C-domain folding. Disordered CCT C-termini within the chamber promote subsequent folding of tubulin Core and Middle domains and GTP-binding. Thus, TRiCs chamber provides chemical and topological directives that shape the folding landscape of its obligate substrates.",

Here we used micro-Raman spectroscopy combined with bright field imaging to study Compound Kushen injection (CKI) at a sub-cellular level including intracellular vesicles(IVs). In our report, CKI caused dysfunction of DNA replication and repair was displayed by Raman spectrum (RS) from the cell nucleus. Meanwhile, the dynamics of CKI induced intracellular vesicles and cell component deconstruction was delineated by RS from the cytoplasm and IVs. The lipids-related biomolecular changes were also presented by the cytoplasm RS: the lipids level in the cytoplasm first descended then uprising. In conclusion, this study validated the mechanism and displayed the dynamics of CKI in treating cancer cells. We proved the capability of subcellular micro-Raman spectroscopy for detecting systematic cellular changes and its application for multi-component drug evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastomas (GBMs) are biologically heterogeneous within and between patients. Many previous attempts to characterize this heterogeneity have classified tumors according to their omics similarities. These discrete classifications have predominantly focused on characterizing malignant cells, neglecting the immune and other cell populations that are known to be present. We leverage a manifold learning algorithm to define a low-dimensional transcriptional continuum along which heterogeneous GBM samples organize. This reveals three polarized states: invasive, immune/inflammatory, and proliferative. The location of each sample along this continuum correlates with the abundance of eighteen malignant, immune, and other cell populations. We connect these cell abundances with magnetic resonance imaging and find that the relationship between contrast enhancement and tumor composition varies with patient sex and treatment status. These findings suggest that GBM transcriptional biology is a predictably constrained continuum that contains a limited spectrum of viable cell cohabitation ecologies. Since the relationships between this ecological continuum and imaging vary with patient sex and tumor treatment status, studies that integrate imaging features with tumor biology should incorporate these variables in their design.",

    "abstract": "Septoria brown spot (caused by Septoria glycines) is the most prevalent soybean disease in Illinois. It is common to use a foliar fungicide to control Septoria brown spot and other foliar diseases. The effects of fungicide on non-target organisms in the phyllosphere are unknown. To study the effect of S. glycines and fungicide application on the soybean phyllosphere mycobiome we sequenced full-length ITS and partial LSU region using oxford nanopore technologies. Sequencing produced 3,342 operational taxonomic units (OTUs). The richness of the fungal community significantly increased with the developmental stage. The soybean lines significantly affected the mycobiome diversity at the early developmental stage but not at the reproductive stages. S. glycines did not significantly affect the alpha diversity but some significant changes were observed for the beta diversity. At the R5 stage, fungicide application significantly changed the composition of the fungal community. The fungicide treatment significantly decreased the proportion of several fungal reads, but it increased the proportion of Septoria. The core microbiome in soybean leaves was composed of Gibberella, Alternaria, Didymella, Cladosporium, Plectosphaerella, Colletotrichum, and Bipolaris. Network analysis identified significant interactions between Septoria reads and Diaporthe, Bipolaris and two other taxonomic units. In this study, we set Septoria as the target organism and demonstrated that metabarcoding could be a tool to quantify the effect of multiple treatments on the fungal phyllosphere community. Better understanding the dynamics of the phyllosphere microbiome is necessary to start untangling late-season diseases of soybean.",

In asthma and other diseases of the respiratory tract, airway cholinergic neurons undergo plasticity and contribute to airway hyperresponsiveness and mucus secretion. We currently lack mechanistic understanding of airway cholinergic neuroplasticity due to the absence of human in vitro models. Here, we developed the first human in vitro model for airway cholinergic neurons using human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) technology. hPSCs were differentiated towards mature and functional airway cholinergic neurons via a vagal precursor. Airway cholinergic neurons were characterized by ChAT and VAChT expression, and responded to chemical stimulation with changes in Ca2+ mobilization. Co-culture of hPSC-derived airway cholinergic neurons with airway smooth muscle cells enhanced phenotypic and functional characteristics of these neurons. The differentiation protocol we developed for human airway cholinergic neurons from hPSCs allows for studies into airway neurobiology and airway neuroplasticity in disease.",

    "abstract": "Electrophysiological datasets are typically analyzed under the assumption that repeated measurements of the same unit of analysis (i.e. neuron or animal) can be treated as statistically independent. Recently, this assumption has been questioned and our data confirms and quantifies this skepticism using ex vivo slice recordings of synaptic currents in D1R+ medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens. We therefore present EPHierStats as a statistical framework to analyze electrophysiological datasets with large numbers of measurements (>100) per unit of analysis. This novel analysis framework enables encoding of the full hierarchical relationships between measurements in a mixed-effects general linear model while also analyzing the distribution of values in assessed variables. Our method can easily be adapted to analyze a wide range of repeated-measures electrophysiological experiments. Implementation of the EPHierStats tool will aid the adaption of modern statistical approaches that prevent pseudoreplication and its associated false discovery rate while enabling statistical assessments of the complex relationships inherent to the field of neuroscience.",

    "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by sporadic collapse of the upper airway leading to periodic disruptions in breathing. Upper airway patency governed by genioglossal nerve activity originates from the hypoglossal motor nucleus. Mice with targeted deletion of the gene Hmox2, encoding the carbon monoxide (CO) producing enzyme, heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), exhibit severe OSA, yet the contribution of central HO-2 dysregulation to the phenomenon is unknown. Using the rhythmic brainstem slice preparation, which contains the preBotzinger complex (preBotC) and the hypoglossal nucleus, we tested the hypothesis that central HO-2 dysregulation weakens hypoglossal motoneuron output. Disrupting HO-2 activity increased transmission failure as determined by the intermittent inability of the preBotC rhythm to trigger output from the hypoglossal nucleus. Failed transmission was associated with a reduced input-output relationship between the preBotC and the motor nucleus. These network phenomena were related to smaller inspiratory drive currents and reduced intrinsic excitability among hypoglossal neurons. In addition to HO-2, hypoglossal neurons also expressed the CO-regulated H2S producing enzyme cystathionine {square}-lyase (CSE). H2S abundance was higher in hypoglossal neurons of HO-2 null mice than wild-type controls. Disrupting CSE function normalized transmission in HO-2 null mice and an H2S donor mimicked the effects of HO-2 dysregulation. These findings demonstrate a hitherto uncharacterized modulation of hypoglossal activity through the interaction of HO-2 and CSE-derived H2S, and supports the perspective that centrally derived HO-2 activity plays an important role regulating upper airway control.",

Head direction cells in distributed brain regions receive a range of sensory inputs, but visual input is particularly important for aligning their responses to environmental landmarks. To investigate how population-level heading responses are aligned to visual input, we recorded from retrosplenial cortex (RSC) of head-fixed mice in a moving environment using two-photon calcium imaging. We show that RSC neurons are tuned to the animals relative orientation in the environment, even in the absence of head movement. Next, we found that RSC receives functionally distinct projections from visual and thalamic areas, and contains several functional classes of neurons. While some functional classes mirror RSC inputs, a newly discovered class coregisters visual and thalamic signals. Finally, decoding analyses reveal unique contributions to heading from each class. Our results suggest an RSC circuit for anchoring heading representations to environmental visual landmarks.",

The gut microbiota and host factors are thought to synergistically shape colonic MP development, although there remains a fundamental gap in our understanding of the details of such collaboration. Here, we report tertiary lymphoid organs (TLOs), enriched in group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s), as a microbiota-operated intestinal niche for the development of monocyte-derived MPs. ILC3-derived colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2) serves as a developmental and functional determinant for MPs and required microbe-derived extracellular adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) as a trigger. Microbial communities rich in extracellular ATP promoted MP turnover via ILC3 activity in an NLRP3-dependent fashion. Single cell RNA-sequencing of MPs revealed unique TLO-associated, CSF2-dependent MP populations critical for anti-microbial defense against enteric infection. Collectively, these findings describe a fundamental framework that constitutes an intestinal MP niche fueled by microbial energy metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Antifungal drug resistance and tolerance poses a serious threat to global public health. In the human fungal pathogen, Candida auris, resistance to triazole, polyene, and echinocandin antifungals is rising, resulting in multidrug resistant isolates. Here, we use genome analysis and in vitro evolution of seventeen new clinical isolates of C. auris from clades I and IV to determine how quickly resistance mutations arise, the stability of resistance in the absence of drug, and the impact of genetic background on evolutionary trajectories. We evolved each isolate in the absence of drug as well as in low and high concentrations of fluconazole. In just three passages, we observed genomic and phenotypic changes including karyotype alterations, aneuploidy, acquisition of point mutations, and increases in MIC values within the populations. Fluconazole resistance was stable in the absence of drug, indicating little to no fitness cost associated with resistance. Importantly, two isolates substantially increased fluconazole resistance to [&ge;]256{micro}g/ml fluconazole. Multiple evolutionary pathways and mechanisms to increase fluconazole resistance occurred simultaneously within the same population. Strikingly, the sub-telomeric regions of C. auris were highly dynamic as deletion of multiple genes near the sub-telomeres occurred during the three passages in several populations. Finally, we discovered a mutator phenotype in a clinical isolate of C. auris. This isolate had elevated mutation rates compared to other isolates and acquired substantial resistance during evolution in vitro and in vivo supporting that the genetic background of clinical isolates can have a significant effect on evolutionary potential.\n\nImportanceDrug resistant Candida auris infections are recognized by the CDC as an urgent threat. Here, we obtained and characterized a set of clinical isolates of C. auris including multiple isolates from the same patient. To understand how drug resistance arises, we evolved these isolates and found that resistance to fluconazole, the most commonly prescribed antifungal, can occur rapidly and that there are multiple pathways to resistance. During our experiment, resistance was gained, but it was not lost, even in the absence of drug. We also found that some C. auris isolates have higher mutation rates than others and are primed to acquire antifungal resistance mutations. Furthermore, we found that multidrug resistance can evolve within a single patient. Overall, our results highlight the high stability and high rates of acquisition of antifungal resistance of C. auris that allow evolution of pan-resistant, transmissible isolates in the clinic.",

Functional insulation of orthologous Pse and Leg biosynthesis pathways accounted for the flagellin glycosylation specificity and motility conferred by the cognate FlmG in the -proteobacteria Caulobacter crescentus and Brevundimonas subvibrioides, respectively. Exploiting these functions, we conducted genetic glyco-profiling to classify Pse or Leg biosynthesis pathways and we used heterologous reconstitution experiments to unearth a signature determinant of Leg biosynthesis in eubacteria and archaea.

    "abstract": "Thermophilic cyanobacteria have been extensively studied in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) hot springs, particularly from decades of work on the thick laminated mats of Octopus and Mushroom Springs. However, focused studies of cyanobacteria outside of these two hot springs have been lacking, especially regarding how physical and chemical parameters along with community morphology influence the genomic makeup of these organisms. Here, we used a metagenomic approach to examine cyanobacteria existing at the upper temperature limits of photosynthesis. We examined 15 alkaline hot spring samples across six geographic areas of YNP, all with varying physical and chemical parameters, and community morphology. We recovered 22 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) belonging to thermophilic cyanobacteria, notably an uncultured Synechococcus-like taxon recovered from the upper temperature limit of photosynthesis, 73{degrees}C, in addition to thermophilic Gloeomargarita. Furthermore, we found that three distinct groups of Synechococcus-like MAGs recovered from different temperature ranges vary in their genomic makeup. MAGs from the uncultured very high temperature (up to 73{degrees}C) Synechococcus-like taxon lack key nitrogen metabolism genes and have genes implicated in cellular stress responses that diverge from other Synechococcus-like MAGs. Across all parameters measured, temperature was the primary determinant of taxonomic makeup of recovered cyanobacterial MAGs. However, Fe, community morphology, and biogeography played an additional role in the distribution and abundance of upper temperature limit-adapted Synechococcus-like MAGs.These findings expand our understanding of cyanobacterial diversity in YNP and provide a basis for interrogation of understudied thermophilic cyanobacteria.\n\nImportanceOxygenic photosynthesis arose early in microbial evolution - approx. 2.5-3.5 billion years ago - and entirely reshaped the biological makeup of Earth. However, despite the span of time in which photosynthesis has been refined, it is strictly limited to temperatures below 73{degrees}C, a barrier that many other biological processes have been able to overcome. Furthermore, photosynthesis at temperatures above 56{degrees}C is limited to circumneutral and alkaline pH. Hot springs in Yellowstone National Park (YNP), which have a large diversity in temperatures, pH and geochemistry provide a natural laboratory to study thermophilic microbial mats, and the cyanobacteria within. While cyanobacteria in YNP microbial mats have been studied for decades, a vast majority of work has focused on two springs within the same geyser basin, both containing similar community morphologies. Thus, the drivers of cyanobacterial adaptations to the upper limits of photosynthesis across a variety of environmental parameters have been understudied. Our findings provide new insights into the influence of these parameters on both taxonomic diversity and genomic content of cyanobacteria across a range of hot spring samples.",

    "abstract": "One of the most prevalent intracellular infections on earth is with Wolbachia: a bacterium in the Rickettsiales that infects a range of insects, crustaceans, chelicerates, and nematodes. Wolbachia is maternally transmitted to offspring and has profound effects on the reproduction and physiology of its hosts, which can result in reproductive isolation, altered vectorial capacity, mitochondrial sweeps, and even host speciation. Some populations stably harbor multiple Wolbachia strains, which can further contribute to reproductive isolation and altered host physiology. However, almost nothing is known about the requirements for multiple intracellular microbes to be stably maintained across generations while they likely compete for space and resources. Here we use a coinfection of two Wolbachia strains (\"wHa\" and \"wNo\") in Drosophila simulans to define the infection and transmission dynamics of an evolutionarily stable double infection. We find that a combination of sex, tissue, and host development contribute to the infection dynamics of the two microbes and that these infections exhibit a degree of niche partitioning across host tissues. wHa is present at a significantly higher titer than wNo in most tissues and developmental stages, but wNo is uniquely dominant in ovaries. Unexpectedly, the ratio of wHa to wNo in embryos does not reflect those observed in the ovaries, indicative of strain-specific transmission dynamics. Understanding how Wolbachia strains interact to establish and maintain stable infections has important implications for the development and effective implementation of Wolbachia-based vector biocontrol strategies, as well as more broadly defining how cooperation and conflict shape intracellular communities.\n\nIMPORTANCEWolbachia are maternally transmitted intracellular bacteria that manipulate the reproduction and physiology of arthropods, resulting in drastic effects on the fitness, evolution, and even speciation of their hosts. Some hosts naturally harbor multiple strains of Wolbachia that are stably transmitted across generations, but almost nothing is known about the factors that limit or promote these co-infections which can have profound effects on the hosts biology and evolution, and are under consideration as an insect-management tool. Here we define the infection dynamics of a known stably transmitted double infection in Drosophila simulans with an eye towards understanding the patterns of infection that might facilitate compatibility between the two microbes. We find that a combination of sex, tissue, and development all contribute how the coinfection establishes.",

    "abstract": "Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is characteristic of numerous diseases, but most studies in this area have not considered the impact of endogenous antioxidative defenses. Here, utilizing multi-omics, we demonstrate that in cardiomyocytes mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) constitutes a major antioxidant defense. In both male and female mice and humans the paradoxical reduction in expression of IDH2 associated with heart failure is compensated for by an increase in the enzymes activity. We describe extensive mutual regulation of the antioxidant activities of IDH2 and NRF2 by a network involving 2-oxoglutarate and L2-hydroxyglutarate and mediated in part through unconventional hydroxymethylation of cytosine residues present in introns. Conditional targeting of ROS in a murine model of heart failure improves cardiac function. Together, these insights may explain why previous attempts to treat heart failure with antioxidants have been unsuccessful and open new approaches to personalizing and, thereby, improving such treatment.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485908v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1032ebeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1c7bforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@70f6a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4fafbc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIParadoxical downregulation of mitochondrial isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH2) in response to oxidative stress leads to the discovery of a robust antioxidative defense in the heart.\nC_LIO_LIAn antioxidative loop involving IDH2 coordinates other antioxidative defenses, such as NRF2.\nC_LIO_LIThis loop produces epigenetic modifications that link oxidative stress to mitochondrial function.\nC_LIO_LIThe conclusion that enhancing antioxidative capacity improves cardiac function only when the endogenous capacity is insufficient opens new approaches to individualized treatment of patients with heart failure.\nC_LI",

Over the last decades, the number of species described on the Korean peninsula has significantly increased, but areas around the boundaries of the Korean peninsula still have to be surveyed for the presence of these species, especially where the environment is similar and connected. Here, we conducted surveys in the continuous landscapes of the Republic of Korea, the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea and the Peoples Republic of China to determine the range of the Gold-spotted pond frog, Pelophylax chosenicus. The surveys were conducted between 2016 and 2020 through visual and call encounters. We also used molecular tools to confirm the species identity of the northernmost population, in China, sequencing the mitochondrial DNA 16S gene fragment. We then determined the importance of landscape types for the species, and especially rice paddies, and used landscape models to define suitable habitats across the region. We found the species to be widespread in low elevation wetlands along the coast of the Yellow Sea, with two isolated populations on the south-east of the Korean Peninsula, and the northernmost population in the vicinity of Dandong in PR China. As this species is listed as threatened in the Republic of Korea, knowing its exact distribution will be important for conservation practices, and this first record for PR China provides a baseline for further surveys.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing problem in evolutionary biology and systematics is defining patterns of diversification and speciation, which is compounded by allopatric distributions of polytypic taxa in biogeographically fragmented landscapes. In this paper we revisit this enduring systematic challenge using Mormon swallowtail butterflies (Papilio subgenus Menelaides)--an evolutionary and genetic model system. Menelaides is speciose and intensively sampled, with nearly 260 years of systematic study complicated by polytypy resulting from discontinuous morphological variation. This variation is structured by the mainland-island matrix of the geologically complex Indo-Australian Region, where drawing species boundaries has been difficult. We sampled variation across the biogeographic range of Menelaides, covering 97% of currently recognized species and nearly half of all subspecies. We generated a well-supported mito-nuclear phylogeny, on which we delineated species based on two species delimitation methods (GMYC and mPTP) and strongly supported reciprocal monophyly. These analyses showed that the true species diversity in this group may be up to 25% greater than traditional taxonomy suggests, and prompts extensive taxonomic restructuring. Biogeographic analyses showed that Menelaides have diversified largely in allopatry in Indo-Australian subregions by repeated dispersals across key biogeographic barriers. These results provide critical insights into the diversification process in this morphologically diverse and taxonomically complicated model group. These results will also be informative in future studies on systematics, biogeography, speciation and morphological diversification in the Indo-Australian Region--arguably the most complex geological land/seascape in the world.",

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are inherited remnants of past retroviruses that colonized host germline over millions of years, providing a sampling of retroviral diversity across time. The utility of ERVs as markers of host genome evolution is augmented by their ability to reveal historic retrovirus-host interactions, given that ERVs are examples of active retroviruses at the time of germline invasion. Here, we utilize the strength of Darwins finches, a system synonymous with evolutionary studies, for investigating ERV history, revealing recent retrovirus-host interactions in natural populations. By mapping ERV variation across all species of Darwins finches and comparing with outgroup species, we highlight geographical and historical patterns of retrovirus-host occurrence, utilizing the system as a natural model for evaluating the extent and timing of retroviral activity in hosts undergoing adaptive radiation and colonization of new environments. We found shared ERVs among all samples indicating retrovirus-host associations pre-dating host speciation, as well as considerable ERV variation across populations of the entire Darwins finches radiation. Unexpected ERV variation in finch species on different islands suggest historical changes in gene flow and selection. Non-random distribution of ERVs along and between chromosomes, as well as across finch species, suggests association between ERV accumulation and the rapid speciation of Darwins finches.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsIntestinal homeostasis is maintained by specialized host cells and the gut microbiota. Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling is essential for gastrointestinal development and homeostasis, and its dysregulation has been implicated in inflammation and colorectal cancer. Axin1 negatively regulates activated Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, but little is known regarding its role in regulating host-microbial interactions in health and disease. Here, we aim to demonstrate that intestinal Axin1 determines gut homeostasis and host response to inflammation.\n\nMethodsThe expression of Axin1 was analyzed in human IBD datasets. To explore the effects and mechanism of intestinal Axin1 in regulating intestinal homeostasis and colitis, we generated mouse models with Axin1 conditional knockout in intestinal epithelial (Axin1{Delta}IEC) and Paneth cells (Axin1{Delta}PC) to compare with control (Axin1LoxP) mice.\n\nResultsWe found increased Axin1 expression in the colonic epithelium of human IBD. Axin1{Delta}IEC mice exhibited altered goblet cell spatial distribution, Paneth cell morphology, reduced lysozyme expression, and enriched Akkermansia muciniphila. Absence of intestinal epithelial and Paneth cell Axin1 decreased susceptibility to DSS-induced colitis in vivo. Axin1{Delta}IEC and Axin1{Delta}PC became more susceptible to DSS-colitis after cohousing with control mice, suggesting the non-colitogenic effect is driven by the gut microbiota.\n\nConclusionWe found loss of intestinal Axin1 protects against colitis, which is likely driven through Paneth cell Axin1 and the microbiota. Our study demonstrates a novel role of Axin1 in mediating intestinal homeostasis and the microbiota. Further mechanistic studies using specific Axin1 mutations elucidating how Axin1 modulates microbiome and host inflammatory response, will provide new therapeutic strategies for human IBD.\n\nWhat you Need to Know1. Background and ContextWnt/beta-catenin is a fundamental molecular pathway that affects intestinal proliferation and differentiation. Axin1 negatively regulates activated Wnt/{beta}-catenin signaling, but little is known regarding its role in the microbiome. Dysfunction of Wnt/beta-catenin was reported in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Axin1 serum level was elevated in patients with UC.\n\n2. New FindingsWe found increased Axin1 expression at both the mRNA and protein level in human IBD. Specifically, we identified increased Axin1 expression positive correlated with pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF- in CD. Our study, for the first time, identifies links between the gut microbiota and intestinal Axin1 in intestinal inflammation through utilization of innovative deletion mouse models in intestinal epithelium and Paneth cells. Loss of intestinal Axin1 plays a novel role in intestinal inflammation by altering the Paneth cells and microbiome (e.g., enriched Akkermansia mucinlphila). Our study has provided insights into the molecular mechanism that might contribute to IBD, especially the novel role of Paneth cell Axin1 in colitis.\n\n3. LimitationsThere are no human or mice studies assessing the role of intestinal epithelial and Paneth cell Axin1 in inflammation and the microbiome.\n\n4. ImpactFurther explorations of the gut microbiota and Axin1 interaction as we report will provide novel mechanistic strategies for therapeutic approaches for human IBD by targeting intestinal Axin1 and Axin1-associated microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Sulfonylureas (SU) are effective and affordable anti-diabetic drugs. But chronic use leads to secondary failure, limiting their utilization. The mechanism of secondary failure is unknown. Here we identify Cyb5r3 downregulation as a mechanism of SU failure and successfully reverse it. Chronic exposure to SU impairs Cyb5r3 levels and reduces islet glucose utilization with a metabolomics signature characterized by low acetyl-CoA and amino acid levels. Cyb5r3 engages in a glucose-dependent interaction that stabilizes glucokinase (Gck) to maintain glucose utilization. Accordingly, activating Gck mutations in patients with hyperinsulinemia reduce Cyb5r3 binding, whereas inactivating MODY mutations increase it, providing evidence for a role of Cyb5r3 in determining flux through Gck. The Cyb5r3 activator tetrahydroindenoindole (THII) rescues secondary failure to SU in an animal model of chronic SU treatment and restores insulin secretion from ex vivo islets. We conclude that Cyb5r3 loss-of-function is a key factor in the secondary failure to SU and a potential target for its prevention, which may lead to a rehabilitation of SU use in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Thiazides are associated with glucose intolerance and new onset diabetes mellitus, but the molecular mechanisms remain elusive. The aim of this study was to decipher the molecular basis of thiazide-induced glucose intolerance. In mice, hydrochlorothiazide induced a pathological glucose tolerance, characterized by reduced first phase insulin secretion but normal insulin sensitivity. In vitro, thiazides inhibited glucose-and sulfonylurea-stimulated insulin secretion in islets and the murine {beta}-cell line Min6 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Inhibition of insulin secretion by thiazides was CO2/HCO3--dependent, not additive to unselective carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibition with acetazolamide and independent of extracellular potassium. In contrast, insulin secretion was unaltered in islets of mice lacking the known molecular thiazide targets NCC (SLC12A3) or NDCBE (SLC4A8). CA expression profiling with subsequent knock-down of individual CA isoforms suggested mitochondrial CA5b as molecular target. In support of these findings, thiazides significantly attenuated Krebs cycle anaplerosis through reduction of mitochondrial oxalacetate synthesis. CA5b KO mice were resistant to thiazide-induced glucose intolerance, and insulin secretion of islets isolated from CA5b KO mice was unaffected by thiazides.\n\nIn summary, our study reveals attenuated insulin secretion due to inhibition of the mitochondrial CA5b isoform in {beta}-cells as molecular mechanism of thiazide-induced glucose intolerance.",

    "abstract": "Incorporation of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins holds great promise for modulating the structure and function of those proteins and for influencing evolutionary dynamics in organisms. Despite significant progress in improving the efficiency of translational machinery needed for incorporating ncAAs, exogenous feeding of high concentrations of chemically-synthesized ncAAs, especially in the case of polar ncAAs, is required to ensure adequate intracellular ncAA levels. Here, we report the creation of autonomous cells, both prokaryotic and eukaryotic, with the ability to biosynthesize and genetically encode sulfotyrosine (sTyr), an important protein post-translational modification with low membrane permeability. We discovered the first enzyme catalyzing tyrosine sulfation, sulfotransferase 1C1 from Nipponia nippon (NnSULT1C1), using a sequence similarity network (SSN). The unique specificity of NnSULT1C1 for tyrosine has been systematically explored using both bioinformatics and computational methods. This NnSULT1C1 was introduced into both bacterial and mammalian cells so as to yield organisms capable of biosynthesizing high levels of intracellular sTyr. These engineered cells produced site-specifically sulfated proteins at a higher yield than cells fed exogenously even with the highest level of sTyr reported in literature. We have used these autonomous cells to prepare highly potent thrombin inhibitors with site-specific sulfation. By enhancing ncAA incorporation efficiency, this added ability of cells to biosynthesize ncAAs and genetically incorporate them into proteins greatly extends the utility of genetic code expansion methods.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=188 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485857v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2c3b08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7a914org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19d9f91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156ee8c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Spatial gene expression, achieved classically through in situ hybridization, is a fundamental tool for topographic phenotyping of cell types in the nervous system. Newly developed techniques allow for the visualization of multiple mRNAs at single-cell resolution, greatly expanding the ability to link gene expression to tissue topography. Yet, methods for efficient and accurate quantification and analysis of high dimensional in situ hybridization are limited. To this end, the Single-Cell Automated Multiplex Pipeline for RNA (SCAMPR) was developed, facilitating rapid and accurate segmentation of neuronal cell bodies using a dual immunohistochemistry-RNAscope protocol and quantification of low and high abundance mRNA signals using open-source image processing and automated segmentation tools. Proof of principle using SCAMPR focused on spatial mapping of gene expression by peripheral (vagal nodose) and central (visual cortex) neurons. The analytical effectiveness of SCAMPR is demonstrated by identifying the impact of early life stress on differential gene expression by vagal neuron subtypes.\n\nMotivationQuantitative analysis of spatial mRNA expression in neurons can lack accuracy and be both computationally and time intensive. Existing methods that rely on nuclear labeling (DAPI) to distinguish adjoining cells lack the precision to detect mRNA expression in the cytoplasm. In addition, quantification methods that rely on puncta counts can generate large, variable datasets that potentially undercount highly expressed mRNAs. To overcome these methodological barriers, we developed the SCAMPR pipeline that allows for fast, accurate segmentation of neuronal cell body boundaries, topographic gene expression mapping, and high dimensional quantification and analysis of mRNA expression in tissue sections.",
