    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWStructural variations (SVs) constitute a significant source of genetic variability in virus genomes. Yet knowledge about SV variability and contribution to the evolutionary process in large double-stranded (ds)DNA viruses is limited. Cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), also commonly known as koi herpesvirus (KHV), has the largest dsDNA genome within herpesviruses. This virus has become one of the biggest threats to common carp and koi farming, resulting in high morbidity and mortalities of fishes, serious environmental damage, and severe economic losses. A previous study analyzing CyHV-3 virulence evolution during serial passages onto carp cell cultures suggested that CyHV-3 evolves, at least in vitro, through an assembly of haplotypes that alternatively become dominant or under-represented. The present study investigates the SV diversity and dynamics in CyHV-3 genome during 99 serial passages in cell culture using, for the first time, ultra-deep whole-genome and amplicon-based sequencing. The results indicate that KHV polymorphism mostly involves SVs. These SVs display a wide distribution along the genome and exhibit high turnover dynamics with a clear bias towards inversion and deletion events. Analysis of the pathogenesis-associated ORF150 region in ten intermediate cell passages highlighted mainly deletion, inversion and insertion variations that deeply altered the structure of ORF150. Our findings indicate that SV turnovers and defective genomes represent key drivers in the viral population dynamics and in vitro evolution of KHV. Thus, the present study can contribute to the basic research needed to design safe live-attenuated vaccines, classically obtained by viral attenuation after serial passages in cell culture.",

    "abstract": "Genomic DNA is continually exposed to endogenous and exogenous factors that promote DNA damage. Eukaryotic genomic DNA is packaged into nucleosomes, which present a barrier to accessing and effectively repairing DNA damage. The mechanisms by which DNA repair proteins overcome this barrier to repair DNA damage in the nucleosome and protect genomic stability is unknown. Here, we determine how the base excision repair (BER) endonuclease AP-endonuclease 1 (APE1) recognizes and cleaves DNA damage in the nucleosome. Kinetic assays determined that APE1 cleaves solvent-exposed AP sites in the nucleosome with 3 - 6 orders of magnitude higher efficiency than occluded AP sites. A cryo-electron microscopy structure of APE1 bound to a nucleosome containing a solvent-exposed AP site identified that APE1 uses a DNA sculpting mechanism for AP site recognition, where APE1 bends the nucleosomal DNA to access the AP site. Notably, additional biochemical and structural characterization of occluded AP sites identified contacts between the nucleosomal DNA and histone octamer that prevent efficient processing of the AP site by APE1. These findings provide a rationale for the position-dependent activity of BER proteins in the nucleosome and suggests the ability of BER proteins to sculpt nucleosomal DNA drives efficient BER in chromatin.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas9 introduces targeted DNA breaks that engage competing DNA repair pathways, producing a spectrum of imprecise insertion/deletion mutations (indels) and precise templated mutations (precise edits). The relative frequencies of these pathways are thought to primarily depend on genomic sequence and cell state contexts, limiting control over mutational outcomes. Here we report that engineered Cas9 nucleases that create different DNA break structures engage competing repair pathways at dramatically altered frequencies. We accordingly designed a Cas9 variant (vCas9) that produces breaks which suppress otherwise dominant nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Instead, breaks created by vCas9 are predominantly repaired by pathways utilizing homologous sequences, specifically microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR). Consequently, vCas9 enables efficient precise editing through HDR or MMEJ while suppressing indels caused by NHEJ in dividing and non-dividing cells. These findings establish a new paradigm of targeted nucleases custom-designed for specific mutational applications.\n\nTeaserCRISPR-Cas9 can be designed to make otherwise infrequent precise editing pathways dominant in dividing and non-dividing cells",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus infections pose a potential threat to livestock production and public health. A novel strategy is needed to control S. aureus infection due to its adaptive evolution to antibiotics. Autophagy plays a key role in degrading bacteria for innate immune cells. In order to promote S. aureus clearance via TLR induced autophagy pathway, the domain fusion TLR2-4 with the extracellular domain of TLR2, specific recognizing S. aureus, and transmembrane and intracellular domains of TLR4 is assembled, then the goats expressing TLR2-4 is generated. TLR2-4 substantially augments the removal of S. aureus within macrophages by elevating autophagy level. Phosphorylated JNK/ERK1/2 promote LC3- puncta in TLR2-4 macrophages during S. aureus-induced autophagy via MyD88-mediated the TAK1 signaling cascade. Meantime, the TRIF-dependent TBK1-TFEB-OPTN signaling is involved in TLR2-4-triggered autophagy after S. aureus challenge. Moreover, the transcript of ATG5 and ATG12 is significantly increased via cAMP-PKA-NF-{kappa}B signaling, which facilitates S. aureus-induced autophagy in TLR2-4 macrophages. Overall, the novel receptor TLR2-4 enhances the autophagy-dependent clearance of S. aureus in macrophages via TAK1/TBK1-JNK/ERK, TBK1-TFEB-OPTN and cAMP-PKA-NF-{kappa}B-ATGs signaling pathways, which provide an alternative approach to resistant against S. aureus infection.",

    "abstract": "The CRESS-DNA viruses are the ubiquitous virus detected in almost all eukaryotic life trees and play an essential role in the maintaining ecosystem of the globe. Still, their genetic diversity is not fully understood. Here we bring to light the genetic diversity of Replication (Rep) and Capsid (Cap) proteins of CRESS-DNA viruses. We divided the Rep protein of the CRESS-DNA virus into ten clusters using CLANS and phylogenetic analyzes. Also, most of the Rep protein in Rep cluster 1 (R1) and R2 (Circoviridae, Smacoviridae, Nanoviridae, and CRESSV1-5) contain the Viral_Rep superfamily and P-loop_NTPase superfamily domains, while the Rep protein of viruses in other clusters has no such characterized functional domain. The Circoviridae, Nanoviridae, and CRESSV1-3 viruses contain two domains, such as Viral_Rep and P-loop_NTPase; the CRESSV4 and CRESSV5 viruses have only the Viral_Rep domain, and most of the sequences in the pCRESS-related group have only P-loop_NTPase, and Smacoviridae do not have these two domains. Further, we divided the Cap protein of the CRESS-DNA virus into 20 clusters using CLANS and phylogenetic analyzes. The Rep and Cap proteins of Circoviridae and Smacoviridae are grouped into a specific cluster. Cap protein of CRESS-DNA viruses grouped with one cluster and Rep protein with another cluster. Further, our study reveals that selection pressure plays a significant role in the evolution of CRESS-DNA viruses Rep and Cap genes rather than mutational pressure. We hope this study will help determine the genetic diversity of CRESS-DNA viruses as more sequences are discovered in the future.\n\nImportanceThe genetic diversity of CRESS-DNA viruses is not fully understood. CRESS-DNA viruses are classified as CRESSV1 to CRESSV6 using only Rep protein. This study revealed that the Rep protein of the CRESS-DNA viruses is classified as CRESSV1 to CRESSV6 groups and the new Smacoviridae-related, CRESSV2-related pCRESS-related, Circoviridae-related, and 1 to 4 outgroups, according to the Viral_Rep and P-loop_NTPase domain organization, CLANS, and phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, for the first time in this study, the Cap protein of CRESS-DNA viruses was classified into 20 distinct clusters by CLANS and phylogenetic analysis. Through this classification, the genetic diversity of CRESS-DNA viruses clarifies the possibility of recombinations in Cap and Rep proteins. Finally, it has been shown that selection pressure plays a significant role in the evolution and genetic diversity of Cap and Rep proteins. This study explains the genetic diversity of CRESS-DNA viruses and hopes that it will help classify future detected viruses.",

    "abstract": "The subfamily Orthoparamyxovirinae is a group of single-stranded, negative-sense RNA viruses that contains many human, animal and zoonotic pathogens. While there are currently only 34 recognized member species in this subfamily, recent research has revealed that much of its diversity remains to be characterized. Using a newly developed nested PCR-based screening assay, we report here the discovery of fifteen orthoparamyxoviruses in rodents and shrews from Belgium and Guinea, thirteen of which are believed to represent new species. Using nanopore sequencing, complete genomes could be determined for almost all of these viruses, enabling a detailed evaluation of their genome characteristics. While most viruses are thought to belong to the rapidly expanding genus Jeilongvirus, we also identify novel members of the genera Narmovirus, Henipavirus and Morbillivirus. Together with other recently discovered orthoparamyxoviruses, both the henipaviruses and the morbillivirus discovered here appear to form distinct rodent-/shrew-borne clades within their respective genera, clustering separately from all currently classified member species. In the case of the henipaviruses, a comparison of the different members of this clade revealed the presence of a secondary conserved open reading frame, encoding for a transmembrane protein, within the F gene, the biological relevance of which remains to be established. While the characteristics of the viruses described here shed further light on the complex evolutionary origin of paramyxoviruses, they also illustrate that the diversity of this group of viruses in terms of genome organization appears to be much larger than previously assumed.\n\nData availabilityThe genome sequences generated in this study have been submitted to GenBank (accession numbers OK623353-OK623368).",

    "abstract": "Hepatic glucose production is crucial for the maintenance of normal glucose homeostasis. Although hepatic insulin resistance contributes to excessive glucose production, its mechanism is not well understood. Here, we show that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), a key enzyme in inositol polyphosphate biosynthesis, plays a role in regulating hepatic insulin signaling and gluconeogenesis both in vitro and in vivo.IPMK-deficient hepatocytes exhibit decreased insulin-induced activation of Akt-FoxO1 signaling. The expression of mRNA levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pck1) and glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pc), key enzymes mediating gluconeogenesis, are increased in IPMK-deficient hepatocytes compared to wild type (WT) hepatocytes. Importantly, re-expressing IPMK restores insulin sensitivity and alleviates glucose production in IPMK-deficient hepatocytes. Moreover, hepatocyte-specific IPMK deletion exacerbates hyperglycemia and insulin sensitivity in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), accompanied by an increase in hepatic glucose production during pyruvate tolerance test and reduction in Akt phosphorylation in IPMK deficient liver. Our results demonstrate that IPMK mediates insulin signaling and gluconeogenesis and may be potentially targeted for treatment of diabetes.\n\nHighlightsIPMK expression is reduced in livers of HFD-fed mice.\n\nHepatocyte-specific deletion of IPMK in mice aggravated HFD-induced insulin resistance.\n\nLoss of IPMK decreased insulin-induced activation of Akt-FoxO1 signaling, leading to the increase of glucose production in hepatocytes.",

    "abstract": "The human AAA+ ATPase CLPB (SKD3) is a protein disaggregase in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and functions to promote the solubilization of various mitochondrial proteins. CLPB deficiency by mutations is associated with a few human diseases with neutropenia and neurological disorders. Unlike canonical AAA+ proteins, CLPB contains a unique ankyrin repeat domain (ANK) at its N-terminus. The mechanism of CLPB functions as a disaggregase and the role of its ANK domain are currently unclear. Herein, we report a comprehensive structural characterization of human CLPB in both the apo- and substrate-bound states. CLPB assembles into homo- tetradecamers in apo-state and is remodeled into homo-dodecamers upon binding to substrates. Conserved pore- loops on the ATPase domains form a spiral staircase to grip and translocate the substrate in a step-size of two amino acid residues. The ANK domain is not only responsible for maintaining the higher-order assembly but also essential for the disaggregase activity. Interactome analysis suggests that the ANK domain may directly interact with a variety of mitochondrial substrates. These results reveal unique properties of CLPB as a general disaggregase in mitochondria and highlight its potential as a target for the treatment of various mitochondria-related diseases.",

Additionally, we characterised synovial fluid and plasma-derived extracellular vesicles with respect to quantity, size, and surface markers.

Human RTF2 was recently implicated in fork restart, leading us to examine fission yeast Rtf2s role in more detail. In agreement with previous studies, we observe reduced barrier activity upon rtf2 deletion. However, we identified Rtf2 to be physically associated with mRNA processing and splicing factors and rtf2 deletion to cause increased intron retention. One of the most affected introns resided in the rtf1 transcript. Using an intronless rtf1 we observed no reduction in RFB activity in the absence of Rtf2.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in molecular modeling using deep learning have the potential to revolutionize the field of structural biology. In particular, AlphaFold has been observed to provide models of protein structures with accuracy rivaling medium-resolution X-ray crystal structures, and with excellent atomic coordinate matches to experimental protein NMR and cryo-electron microscopy structures. Here we assess the hypothesis that AlphaFold models of small, relatively rigid proteins have accuracies (based on comparison against experimental data) similar to experimental solution NMR structures. We selected six representative small proteins with structures determined by both NMR and X-ray crystallography, and modeled each of them using AlphaFold. Using several structure validation tools integrated under the Protein Structure Validation Software suite (PSVS), we then assessed how well these models fit to experimental NMR data, including NOESY peak lists (RPF-DP scores), comparisons between predicted rigidity and chemical shift data (ANSURR scores), and 15N-1H residual dipolar coupling data (RDC Q factors) analyzed by software tools integrated in the PSVS suite. Remarkably, the fits to NMR data for the protein structure models predicted with AlphaFold are generally similar, or better, than for the corresponding experimental NMR or X-ray crystal structures. Similar conclusions were reached in comparing AlphaFold2 predictions and NMR structures for three targets from the Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP). These results contradict the widely held misperception that AlphaFold cannot accurately model solution NMR structures. They also document the value of PSVS for model vs. data assessment of protein NMR structures, and the potential for using AlphaFold models for guiding analysis of experimental NMR data and more generally in structural biology.",

Despite widespread use of this compound, it is unknown whether SMIFH2 inhibits all human formins. Additionally, the nature of protein/inhibitor interactions remains elusive. We assayed SMIFH2 against human formins representing six of the seven mammalian classes and found inhibitory activity against all formins tested. We synthesized a panel of SMIFH2 derivatives and found that, while many alterations disrupt SMIFH2 activity, substitution of an electron-donating methoxy group in place of the bromine along with halogenation of the furan ring increases potency by approximately five-fold. Similar to SMIFH2, the active derivatives are also pan-inhibitors for the formins tested. This result suggests that while potency can be improved, the goal of distinguishing between highly conserved FH2 domains may not be achievable using the SMIFH2 scaffold.",

    "abstract": "Throughout the world, wetlands have experienced degradation and declines in areal coverage. Fortunately, recognition of the value of wetlands has generated interest in preserving and restoring them. Post-restoration monitoring is necessary to analyze success or failure, thereby informing subsequent management decisions. Restoration of oxbow wetlands has become the focus of targeted restoration efforts to promote recovery of biodiversity and sensitive species, and to enhance ecosystem services. The fish communities of oxbows have been the subject of many monitoring studies. However, an optimal method for monitoring the fish communities of oxbows has not been described, thereby limiting our capacity to effectively manage these ecosystems. We compared four sampling methodologies (backpack electrofishing, fyke netting, minnow trapping, and seining) for fish community data collection with a primary objective of determining an optimal method for sampling fish communities in small oxbow wetlands. Seining and fyke netting were determined to be optimal methods for sampling oxbow fish communities. Backpack electrofishing and minnow trapping produced lower total catch and taxonomic richness values than seining and fyke netting. Although seining and fyke netting produced similar taxonomic diversity and abundance values, qualitative analysis revealed that seining caused greater habitat disturbance and potential stress to fish. Therefore, consideration must be given to how species present (especially sensitive species) within the wetland could be impacted by sampling disturbance when choosing between seining and fyke netting.",

    "abstract": "The utilisation of plants directly as quantifiable natural sensors is proposed. A case study measuring surface wettability of Aucuba japonica, or Japanese Laurel, plants using a novel smartphone field interrogator is demonstrated. This plant has been naturalised globally from Asia. Top-down contact angle measurements map wettability on-site and characterise a range of properties impacting plant health, such as aging, solar and UV exposure, and pollution. Leaves at an early age or in the shadow of trees are found to be hydrophobic with contact angle{theta} ~ 99{degrees}, while more mature leaves under sunlight are hydrophilic with{theta} ~ 79{degrees}. Direct UVA irradiation at{lambda} = 365 nm is shown to accelerate aging, changing contact angle of one leaf from slightly hydrophobic at{theta} ~ 91{degrees} to be hydrophilic with{theta} ~ 87 {degrees} after 30 min. Leaves growing beside a road with heavy traffic are observed to be substantially hydrophilic, as low as{theta} ~ 47{degrees}, arising from increased wettability with particulate accumulation on the leaf surface. Away from the road, the contact angle increases as high as{theta} ~ 96{degrees}. The results demonstrate that contact angle measurements using a portable diagnostic IoT edge device can be taken into the field for environmental detection, pollution assessment and more. Using an internet connected smartphone combined with a plant sensor allows multiple measurements at multiple locations together in real-time, potentially enabling tracking of parameter change anywhere where plants are present or introduced. This hybrid integration of widely distributed living organic systems with the internet marks the beginning of a new bionic internet-of-things (b-IoT).",
