    "abstract": "BNIP3 is a BH3 only protein with both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival roles depending on the cellular context. It remains unclear how BNIP3 RNA level dictates cell fate decisions of cancer cells. Here we undertook a quantitative analysis of BNIP3 expression and functions in single cell datasets of various epithelial malignancies. Our results demonstrated that BNIP3 upregulation characterizes cancer cell subpopulations with increased fitness and proliferation. We further validated the upregulation of BNIP3 in liver cancer organoids compared with 2D culture. Taken together, the combination of in silico perturbations using public single cell datasets and experimental cancer modeling using organoids ushered in a new approach to address cancer heterogeneity.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression is a biochemical process, where stochastic binding and unbinding events naturally generate fluctuations and cell-to-cell variability in gene dynamics. These fluctuations typically have destructive consequences for proper biological dynamics and function (e.g., loss of timing and synchrony in biological oscillators). Here, we show that gene expression noise counter-intuitively accelerates the evolution of a biological oscillator and, thus, can impart a benefit to living organisms. We used computer simulations to evolve two mechanistic models of a biological oscillator at different levels of gene expression noise. We first show that gene expression noise induces oscillatory-like dynamics in regions of parameter space that cannot oscillate in the absence of noise. We then demonstrate that these noise-induced oscillations generate a fitness landscape whose gradient robustly and quickly guides evolution by mutation towards robust and self-sustaining oscillation. These results suggest that noise can help dynamical systems evolve or learn new behavior by revealing cryptic dynamic phenotypes outside the bifurcation point.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=181 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485207v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (44K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fdbc9forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6a8b08org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cdbc7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1116812_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Many small pelagic fishes obligately form schools; some of these schools attain a remarkable size. Although the school is a fundamental and important ecological unit and is the site of biological interactions such as competition and predation, information on schooling processes in the field remains scarce. Here, we examined the quantitative relationships between population density and school size, the number of schools, and other school characteristics (i.e., packing density, volume, and cross-sectional area) in three species of small pelagic fishes: Japanese anchovy Engraulis japonicus, Japanese sardine Sardinops melanostictus, and chub mackerel Scomber japonicus. We found that school size increased almost linearly with population density, whereas the number of schools and other characteristics increased non-linearly with population density, whereby the rate of increase slowed radically as population density increased. These results indicate that, at low population densities, an increase in density causes an increase in both school size and the number of schools, whereas at higher population densities, an increase in density triggers the formation of larger schools rather than more schools. Furthermore, we found that the shapes of the relationships of all school characteristics with population density differed among species. Our results indicate that the schooling behaviour of small pelagic fishes is density-dependent, and responses to changes in density are species-specific. Our results provide insight into how biological interactions such as intra- and inter-specific competition and predator-prey interactions mediate the density-dependent processes that underlie the population dynamics and community structure of small pelagic fishes in marine ecosystems.",

While inner speech has been a research topic in philosophy and psychology for half a century, recent attempts have been made to decode nonvoiced spoken words by using various brain-computer interfaces. The main shortcomings of existing work are reproducibility and the availability of data and code. In this work, we investigate various methods (using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTM)) for the detection task of 5 vowels and 6 words on a publicly available EEG dataset. The main contributions of this work are (1) subject dependent vs. subject-independent approaches, (2) the effect of different preprocessing steps (Independent Component Analysis (ICA), down-sampling and filtering), and (3) word classification (where we achieve state-of-the-art performance on a publicly available dataset). Overall we achieve a performance accuracy of 35.20% and 29.21% when classifying 5 vowels and 6 words respectively in a publicly available dataset, using our tuned iSpeech-CNN architecture. All of our code and processed data are publicly available to ensure reproducibility. As such, this work contributes to a deeper understanding and reproducibility of experiments in the area of inner speech detection.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveSudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) accounts for 20% of mortality in those with recurrent seizures. While risk factors, monitoring systems, and standard practices are in place, the pathophysiology of SUDEP is still not well understood. Better knowledge of SUDEP and its potential mechanisms of action is crucial to reducing risk in this patient population and developing potential treatment options. Clinical studies and animal models of SUDEP suggest that diminished post-ictal respiratory control may be the dominant mechanism contributing to mortality. Recently, it was demonstrated that the depletion of the neuropeptide galanin in the amygdala occurs in human SUDEP. The amygdala plays a key role in the central integration of respiratory signaling; the depletion of galanin may represent a critical change that predisposes individuals to SUDEP.\n\nMethodsTo evaluate the potential benefit of enhancing galaninergic signaling as a means to protect against SUDEP, we studied seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) following central (intracerebroventricular, intra-amygdala) and systemic (intraperitoneal, subcutaneous) administration of galanin agonists. Seizure naive and seizure experienced (fully kindled) mice were tested.\n\nResultsCentral and systemically-administered galanin analogs protect against S-IRA in naive C57Bl/6J mice. Differential efficacy between receptor subtype-selective analogs varied based on the route of administration. Sub-chronic systemic administration at doses that reduced 6 Hz seizures also protected against S-IRA. Acute treatment benefits also extended to fully kindled mice subjected to tonic extension.\n\nSignificanceThese data demonstrate that galanin agonists may be protective against post-ictal respiratory collapse.\n\nKEY POINTSO_LICentral and systemic galanin agonists prevent seizure-induced respiratory arrest.\nC_LIO_LIEfficacy was observed in three separate mouse strains under various experimental conditions.\nC_LIO_LISub-chronic administration demonstrated galanin agonist protection against respiratory arrest.\nC_LIO_LIAcute systemic administration also conferred protection against respiratory arrest following tonic extension.\nC_LIO_LIGalanin analogs may represent a novel potential therapy in SUDEP-susceptible individuals.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "In high-risk environments, fast and accurate responses to warning systems are essential to efficiently handle emergency situations. The aim of the present study was twofold: 1) investigating whether hand action videos (i.e., gesture alarms) trigger faster and more accurate responses than text alarm messages (i.e., written alarms), especially when mental workload (MWL) is high; and 2) investigating the brain activity in response to both types of alarms as a function of MWL. Regardless of MWL, participants (N = 28) were found to be both faster and more accurate when responding to gesture alarms than to written alarms. Brain electrophysiological results suggest that this greater efficiency might be due to a facilitation of the action execution, reflected by the decrease in mu and beta power observed around the response time window. These results suggest that gesture alarms may improve operators performances in emergency situations.",

The rate with which hydrogen peroxide damages biomolecules required for life increases with temperature, yet little is known about how organisms cope with this temperature-dependent threat. Here, we show that Caenorhabditis elegans nematodes use temperature information perceived by sensory neurons to cope with the temperature-dependent threat of hydrogen peroxide produced by the pathogenic bacterium Enterococcus faecium. These nematodes preemptively induce the expression of specific hydrogen peroxide defenses in response to perception of high temperature by a pair of sensory neurons. These neurons communicate temperature information to target tissues expressing those defenses via an insulin/IGF1 hormone. This strategy, which we call \"enhancer sensing,\" is the first example of a multicellular organism inducing their defenses to a chemical when they sense an inherent enhancer of the reactivity of that chemical.",

    "abstract": "Biological control of mosquito vectors using the insect-specific bacteria Wolbachia is an emerging strategy for the management of human arboviral diseases. We recently described the development of a strain of Ae. aegypti infected with the Wolbachia strain wAlbB (referred to as the wAlbB2-F4 strain) through simple backcrossing of wild type Australian mosquitoes with a wAlbB infected Ae. aegypti strain from the USA. Field releases of male wAlbB2-F4 mosquitoes resulted in the successful suppression of a wild population of mosquitoes in the trial sites by exploiting the strains Wolbachia-induced cytoplasmic incompatibility. We now demonstrate that the strain is resistant to infection by dengue and Zika viruses and is genetically similar to endemic Queensland populations. There was a fourfold reduction in the proportion of wAlbB2-F4 mosquitoes that became infected following a blood meal containing dengue 2 virus (16.7%) compared to wild type mosquitoes (69.2%) and a 6-7 fold reduction in the proportion of wAlbB2-F4 mosquitoes producing virus in saliva following a blood meal containing an epidemic strain of Zika virus (8.7% in comparison to 58.3% in wild type mosquitoes). Restriction-site Associated DNA (RAD) sequencing revealed that wAlbB2-F4 mosquitoes have > 98% Australian ancestry, confirming the successful introduction of the wAlbB2 infection into the Australian genomic background through backcrossing. Genotypic and phenotypic analyses showed the wAlbB2-F4 strain retains the insecticide susceptibility phenotype and genotype of the Australian mosquitoes. We demonstrate that the Wolbachia wAlbB2-F4, in addition to being suitable for suppression programs, can be effective in population replacement programs given its high inhibition of virus infection in mosquitoes. The ease at which a target mosquito population can be transfected with wAlbB2, while retaining genotypes and phenotypes of the target population, shows the robustness of this strain as a biocontrol agent against the Ae. aegypti mosquito itself as well as the pathogens it transmits.\n\nIMPORTANCEEpidemics of arthopod-borne virus (arbovirus) diseases affect millions of people and are becoming more frequent and widespread. A successful strategy to control these diseases is by infecting mosquito populations with benign, insect-specific Wolbachia bacteria that render mosquitoes refractory to infection with pathogenic arboviruses. Here we show that a strain of the major mosquito vector Ae. aegypti that was infected with Wolbachia following a simple back-cross mating procedure is refractory to infection with dengue and Zika viruses. Importantly, the genetic background of the strain is equivalent to the target population, which is important for persistence of the strain and regulatory approval.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundScab, caused by the biotrophic fungus Venturia inaequalis, is the most economically important disease of apples worldwide. During infection, V. inaequalis occupies the subcuticular environment, where it secretes virulence factors, termed effectors, to promote host colonization. Consistent with other plant-pathogenic fungi, many of these effectors are expected to be non-enzymatic proteins, some of which can be recognized by corresponding host resistance proteins to activate plant defences, thus acting as avirulence determinants. To develop durable control strategies against scab, a better understanding of the roles that these effector proteins play in promoting subcuticular growth by V. inaequalis, as well as in activating, suppressing or circumventing resistance protein-mediated defences in apple, is required.\n\nResultsWe generated the first comprehensive RNA-seq transcriptome of V. inaequalis during colonization of apple. Analysis of this transcriptome revealed five temporal waves of gene expression that peaked during early, mid or mid-late infection. While the number of genes encoding secreted, non-enzymatic proteinaceous effector candidates (ECs) varied in each wave, most belonged to waves that peaked in expression during mid-late infection. Spectral clustering based on sequence similarity determined that the majority of ECs belonged to expanded protein families. To gain insights into function, the tertiary structures of ECs were predicted using AlphaFold2. Strikingly, despite an absence of sequence similarity, many ECs were predicted to have structural similarity to avirulence proteins from other plant-pathogenic fungi, including members of the MAX, LARS, ToxA and FOLD effector families. In addition, several other ECs, including an EC family with sequence similarity to the AvrLm6 avirulence effector from Leptosphaeria maculans, were predicted to adopt a KP6-like fold. Thus, proteins with a KP6-like fold represent another structural family of effectors shared among plant-pathogenic fungi.\n\nConclusionsOur study reveals the transcriptomic profile underpinning subcuticular growth by V. inaequalis and provides an enriched list of ECs that can be investigated for roles in virulence and avirulence. Furthermore, our study supports the idea that numerous sequence-unrelated effectors across plant-pathogenic fungi share common structural folds. In doing so, our study gives weight to the hypothesis that many fungal effectors evolved from ancestral genes through duplication, followed by sequence diversification, to produce sequence-unrelated but structurally similar proteins.",

Here we show for the first time that SUMO4 promotes DNA double-strand break signalling in a manner distinct from SUMO1 or SUMO2/3. We show that SUMO4 function depends on interaction with partner proteins through SUMO interacting motifs and, on its inability, to be conjugated. We show that SUMO4 promotes the activity of the SUMO protease SENP1. In the absence of SUMO4, reduced SENP1 catalytic activity results in hyperSUMOylation that unbalances the recruitment of several DSB repair factors, including RAP80.

Polygenic scores (PGS), which combine these effects into one genetic summary measure, are increasingly used to investigate polygenic effects in independent samples. Whereas PGS explain a considerable amount of variance in intelligence, it is largely unknown how brain structure and function mediate this relationship. Here we show that individuals with higher PGS for educational attainment and intelligence had higher scores on cognitive tests, larger surface area, and more efficient fiber connectivity derived by graph theory. Fiber network efficiency as well as surface of brain areas partly located in parieto-frontal regions were found to mediate the relationship between PGS and cognitive performance.

Specifically for prokaryotes, our dataset indicates that evolutionary relationships and host-pathogen interactions, but not the ecological niche in general, select for a similar degree of DNA modification. In higher eukaryotes, largest concentration differences between tissues are detected for 5hmdC. Our dataset further reveals unique biological cases that warrant attention in the study of DNA modifications. For instance, while our data shows that most species contain just one dominating DNA modification, we detect all dominianting DNA modifications (5mdC, N6mdA, and 5hmdC) to exist in parallel in Raphanus sativus. Other plant species, like onion, sunflower, or the grass big bluestem, can have more than 35% of cytosines methylated. Finally, 5hmdC, so far mostly studied in the vertebrate central nervous system, was identified to reach a concentration of up to 8% of all cytosines in the Oman garra brain, and was also detected in several plants, like Lepidium sativum. The present study underscores the exploitation of biological diversity for studying DNA modifications.",

However, it remains challenging to perform differential composition analysis in the presence of complex experimental designs and uncertainty in cell type assignment. Here, we introduce a statistical model and an open source R package, DCATS, for differential composition analysis based on a beta-binomial regression framework that addresses these challenges.

    "abstract": "Engineered microbial cells present a sustainable alternative to fossil-based synthesis of chemicals and fuels. Cellular synthesis routes are readily assembled and introduced into microbial strains using state-of-the-art synthetic biology tools. However, the optimization of the strains required to reach industrially feasible production levels is far less efficient. It typically relies on trial-and-error leading into high uncertainty in total duration and cost. New techniques that can cope with the complexity and limited mechanistic knowledge of the cellular regulation are called for guiding the strain optimization.\n\nIn this paper, we put forward a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach that learns from experiments to tune the metabolic enzyme levels so that the production is improved. Our method is model-free and does not assume prior knowledge of the microbes metabolic network or its regulation. The multi-agent approach is well-suited to make use of parallel experiments such as multi-well plates commonly used for screening microbial strains.\n\nWe demonstrate the methods capabilities using the genome-scale kinetic model of Escherichia coli, k-ecoli457, as a surrogate for an in vivo cell behaviour in cultivation experiments. We investigate the methods performance relevant for practical applicability in strain engineering i.e. the speed of convergence towards the optimum response, noise tolerance, and the statistical stability of the solutions found. We further evaluate the proposed MARL approach in improving L-tryptophan production by yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using publicly available experimental data on the performance of a combinatorial strain library.\n\nOverall, our results show that multi-agent reinforcement learning is a promising approach for guiding the strain optimization beyond mechanistic knowledge, with the goal of faster and more reliably obtaining industrially attractive production levels.\n\nAuthor summaryEngineered microbial cells offer a sustainable alternative solution to chemical production from fossil resources. However, to make the chemical production using microbial cells economically feasible, they need to be substantially optimized. Due to the biological complexity, this optimization to reach sufficiently high production is typically a costly trial and error process.\n\nThis paper presents an Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach to guide this task. Our tool learns a model from previous experiments and uses the model to suggest improvements to the engineering design, until a satisfactory production performance is reached. This paper evaluates the behaviour of the proposed AI method from several angles, including the amount of experiments needed, the tolerance to noise as well as the stability of the proposed designs.",

    "abstract": "Single-Cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has provided unprecedented opportunities for exploring gene expression and thus uncovering regulatory relationships between genes at the single cell level. However, scRNA-seq relies on isolating cells from tissues. Thus, the spatial context of the regulatory processes is lost. A recent technological innovation, spatial transcriptomics, allows to measure gene expression while preserving spatial information. A first step in the spatial transcriptomic analysis is to identify the cell type which requires a careful selection of cell-specific marker genes. For this purpose, currently scRNA-seq data is used to select limited number of marker genes from among all genes that distinguish cell types from each other. This study proposes scMAGS (single-cell MArker Gene Selection), a new approach for marker gene selection from scRNA-seq data for spatial transcriptomics studies. scMAGS uses a filtering step in which the candidate genes are extracted prior to the marker gene selection step. For the selection of marker genes, cluster validity indices, Silhouette index or Calinski-Harabasz index (for large datasets) are utilized. Experimental results showed that, in comparison to the existing methods, scMAGS is scalable, fast and accurate. Even for the large datasets with millions of cells, scMAGS could find the required number of marker genes in a reasonable amount of time with less memory requirements.",

A family of \"divergent\" KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE2 (KAI2d) genes encode proteins that recognize strigolactone (SL) class germination simulants. We explored specificity of germination stimulant detection by analyzing interspecific segregants of a cross between Orobanche cernua and O. cumana, closely related species that differ in stimulant response. O. cernua parasitizes tomato and germinates in response to the SL orobanchol, while O. cumana parasitizes sunflower and responds to dehydrocostus lactone (DCL). KAI2d genes were catalogued in parents and in segregants that showed stimulant specificity. KAI2d genes were also functionally assayed in the Arabidopsis kai2 mutant background. We identified five full-length KAI2d genes in O. cernua and eight in O. cumana. The O. cernua KAI2d2, as well as its ortholog in O. cumana, are associated with SL perception. A cluster of O. cumana KAI2d genes was genetically linked to DCL perception, although no specific receptor gene was identified by heterologous complementation. These findings support the KAI2d-mediated perception of SLs, but fall short of explaining how O. cumana perceives DCL. The ability of some O. cumana KAI2d genes to detect SLs points to the involvement of additional factors in regulating stimulant specificity.",

Furthermore, distinct spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) operates in these up and down states. The contribution of different plasticity rules to neural information coding and memory reorganization remains unknown. Here, we show that optimal synaptic plasticity for information maximization in a cortical neuron model provides a unified explanation for these phenomena. The model indicates that the optimal synaptic plasticity is biased towards depression as the baseline firing rate increases. This property explains the distinct STDP observed in the up and down states. Furthermore, it explains how global and local slow waves predominantly potentiate and depress synapses, respectively, if the background firing rate of excitatory neurons declines with the spatial scale of waves as the model predicts. The model provides a unifying account of the role of NREM sleep, bridging neural information coding, synaptic plasticity, and memory reorganization.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental aspect of human mental life is the seamless ability for integration of emotion and cognition. Despite progress regarding the spatial architecture of Emotion-Cognition Integration (ECI), the time course of ECI processes remains unclear. To examine the temporal organization of brain oscillations underpinning ECI, we simultaneously manipulated emotional valence of stimuli and cognitive task demand while recording electrophysiological responses of 61 participants. They were asked to complete tasks with low (body-part judgement) and high (laterality judgement) cognitive demand while viewing other people photographs that varied on dimensions of laterality (left or right), body-part (hand or foot), and emotional valence (pain or no pain). We found increased reaction times and error rates in pain versus no pain during laterality judgement relative to body-part judgement, suggesting reciprocal inhibition between emotion and cognition. EEG results showed that 1) emotion processing (valence) occurred first in the theta band from 144 to 372 ms; 2) cognitive processing (laterality) took place in the theta band from 332 to 608 ms; 3) emotional and cognitive processes were integrated in the alpha band from 268 ms and lasted to 800 ms. These findings reveal oscillatory dynamics of the processing and integration of emotion and cognition, providing further insights into the underlying neurophysiology. This may ultimately contribute to our understanding of ECI processing in psychopathology.",

Our recent work argues against this model by showing that cells in area 3b integrate information from cutaneous and proprioceptive modalities. Here, we further test this model, by studying the multi-finger neural integration properties of area 3b. In contrast to the prevailing view, we found that most cells in area 3b have a receptive field (RF) that extends to multiple digits. Responses to tactile stimulation emerged earlier in cells with a multi-digit (MD) vs. single-digit (SD) RF. We also found that the RF size of MD cells (the number of responsive digits) increased across time, and the orientation preference across digits was highly correlated. Taken together, these data provide strong evidence that area 3b plays a larger role in generating neural representations of tactile objects, as opposed to just being a  feature detector relay site.",

Although genetic association studies have identified a number of risk factors, the etiology of BD and its tissue manifestations remains unknown, and the landscape of immune responses in BD is opaque, particularly in terms of inflammatory recurrence. In this study, we mapped the transcriptomes of the immune cell compartment in BD at single-cell resolution, sampling both circulation and affected skin in order to chart the immune interplay driving pathogenesis. Through comprehensive expression and communication analysis of the twenty major cell types identified, we observe striking mechanistic differences in immune response between BD skin lesions and peripheral circulation involving TNF signaling and T cell migration. Through integrated TCR sequencing, we further discover a pattern of clonal sharing between circulating and skin CD8+T cell populations along a trajectory defined by the acquisition of tissue-residential properties. In addition, we also identify a population of expanded CD4+ Tregs with the propensity to produce IL-32. Instead of suppressing effector T cell proliferation and function, IL-32 triggers increased expression of CD97, and may thus encourage prolonged local T cell activity in the skin. Collectively, our data serve to advance understandings of contributions of varying immune cell types to BD pathogenesis in the vasculature and skin, as well as the lifecycle patterns of T cells clones in this context. These data may also assist in further investigations of the mechanisms contributing to Treg dysfunction in systemic autoimmunity, while generating a conceptual model of T cell function contributing to BD recurrence.",

Despite a strong correlation between gut microbiota and obesity, a limited study is available to suggest the direct involvement of fungus in host physiology. Candida albicans survives as a commensal fungus in the gastrointestinal tract, and its excessive growth causing infections in immune-suppressed individuals is widely accepted. However, any mutualistic relationship that may exist between C. albicans and the host remains outstanding. Here we show that the dietary C. albicans do not cause any noticeable infections, and our metagenomics analyses suggest that it colonizes in the gut and modulates microbiome dynamics which in turn negates the high-fat diet induced uncontrolled body weight gain, metabolic hormonal imbalances, and inflammatory response. Interestingly, adding C. albicans to a non-obesogenic diet stimulates the appetite regulated hormones and helped the mice gain healthy body weight. In concert, our results suggest a mutualism between C. albicans and the host, therefore, contrary to the notion, C. albicans is not always an adversary rather a bonafide admirable companion of the host.

    "abstract": "DNA-binding proteins with roles in chromatin architecture and transcriptional regulation are present in all three domains of life. Histones package DNA and regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, and find their evolutionary origin in the domain of life Archaea. Previously characterised archaeal histones have a somewhat conserved functional role in nucleosome formation and DNA packaging. However, previous research has indicated that the histone-like proteins of high salt-adapted archaea, or halophiles, appear to function differently. The sole histone protein encoded by the model halophilic species Halobacterium salinarum is non-essential, is involved in direct and indirect transcriptional regulation, and does not appear to package DNA. Here we use protein-DNA binding assays, computational analysis, and quantitative phenotyping to compare DNA binding patterns across halophilic histone proteins, bacterial and archaeal TFs, NAPs, and eukaryotic histones. Like TFs, halophilic histones bind the genome too sparsely to compact the genome. However, unlike TFs, binding occurs in both coding and intergenic regions. Unlike histones, halophilic histone occupancy is not depleted at the start sites of genes, and halophilic genomes lack the dinucleotide periodicity known to facilitate histone binding. We detect unique sequence preferences for histone binding in halophiles. Together these data suggest that the non-essentiality and genome-wide binding features of halophilic histone-like proteins are conserved across halophiles; they bind DNA in ways resembling both TFs and chromatin proteins, but do not appear to play a role in forming chromatin.\n\nIMPORTANCEMost cells in eukaryotic species - from yeast to humans- possess histone proteins that pack and unpack DNA in response to environmental cues. These essential proteins regulate the genes necessary for important cellular processes, including development and stress protection. The domain of life Archaea represent the evolutionary progenitors of eukaryotes. The universal conservation of the primary sequences of histone proteins across archaeal lineages suggests that eukaryotic histones originated in the Archaea. However, archaeal histones lack N-terminal tails and, in some species, package DNA in a continuous helix with no linker DNA between nucleosomes. We recently discovered that histones in hypersaline adapted archaeal species do not package DNA, and can act like transcription factors (TFs) to regulate stress response gene expression. Here we compare hypersaline histone function to a variety of DNA binding proteins across the tree of life, revealing a mosaic of functions for hypersaline-adapted histones.",

Application of CEPT (chroman 1, emricasan, polyamines, trans-ISRIB) for just 24 hours during cell aggregation has long-lasting consequences affecting morphogenesis, gene expression, and cellular differentiation. Various qualification methods confirmed that CEPT treatment consistently improved EB and organoid fitness as compared to the widely used ROCK inhibitor Y-27632.

    "abstract": "Environmental changes can trigger phenotypic variation in plants through epigenetic mechanisms, but strong genetic influences on epigenetic variation and phenotypes make it difficult to isolate and study these effects. We investigated phenotypic plasticity using the Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra cv.  Italica Duroi), a globaly distributed clonal tree. We surveyed 14 functional traits related to tree growth, ecophysiological and phenological processes in poplar ramets collected along a wide geographical range in Europe and planted under common garden conditions. We investigated whether phenotypic variation was related to geography and historical bioclimatic data of the ramets sites of origin using linear mixed effect models. We found significant differences in among ramets from different geographic origins in tree height, number of stems per ramet and duration of bud flush. However, microenvironmental variation in the common garden, captured via block effects, had an even bigger impact on phenotypic variation than the environmental conditions at the sites of origin. Our results show that phenotypic variation in the ramets might be associated to the climate origin from different climates, suggesting possible epigenetic memory. However, such legacy effects might be quickly outweighed by new environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "O_LIThe most basic behavioural states of animals can be described as active or passive. However, while high-resolution observations of activity patterns can provide insights into the ecology of animal species, few methods are able to measure the activity of individuals of small taxa in their natural environment. We present a novel approach in which the automated VHF radio-tracking of small vertebrates fitted with lightweight transmitters (< 0.2 g) is used to distinguish between active and passive behavioural states.\nC_LIO_LIA dataset containing > 3 million VHF signals was used to train and test a random forest model in the assignment of either active or passive behaviour to individuals from two forest-dwelling bat species (Myotis bechsteinii (n = 50) and Nyctalus leisleri (n = 20)). The applicability of the model to other taxonomic groups was demonstrated by recording and classifying the behaviour of a tagged bird and by simulating the effect of different types of vertebrate activity with the help of humans carrying transmitters. The random forest model successfully classified the activity states of bats as well as those of birds and humans, although the latter were not included in model training (F-score 0.96-0.98).\nC_LIO_LIThe utility of the model in tackling ecologically relevant questions was demonstrated in a study of the differences in the daily activity patterns of the two bat species. The analysis showed a pronounced bimodal activity distribution of N. leisleri over the course of the night while the night-time activity of M. bechsteinii was relatively constant. These results show that significant differences in the timing of species activity according to ecological preferences or seasonality can be distinguished using our method.\nC_LIO_LIOur approach enables the assignment of VHF signal patterns to fundamental behavioural states with high precision and is applicable to different terrestrial and flying vertebrates. To encourage the broader use of our radio-tracking method, we provide the trained random forest models together with an R-package that includes all necessary data-processing functionalities. In combination with state-of-the-art open-source automated radio-tracking, this toolset can be used by the scientific community to investigate the activity patterns of small vertebrates with high temporal resolution, even in dense vegetation.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Snake fungal disease (SFD; ophidiomycosis), caused by the pathogen Ophidiomyces ophidiicola (Oo), has been documented in wild snakes in North America and Eurasia, and is considered an emerging disease in the eastern USA. However, a lack of historical disease data has made it challenging to determine whether Oo is a recent arrival to the USA or whether SFD emergence is due to other factors. Here, we examined the genomes of 82 Oo strains to determine the pathogens history in the eastern USA. Oo strains from the USA formed a clade (Clade II) distinct from European strains (Clade I), and molecular dating indicated that these clades diverged too recently ([~]2,000 years ago) for transcontinental dispersal of Oo to have occurred via natural snake movements across Beringia. A lack of nonrecombinant intermediates between clonal lineages in Clade II indicates that Oo has actually been introduced multiple times to North America from an unsampled source population, and molecular dating indicates that several of these introductions occurred within the last few hundred years. Molecular dating also indicated that the most common Clade II clonal lineages have expanded recently in the USA, with time of most recent common ancestor mean estimates ranging from 1985-2007 CE. The presence of Clade II in captive snakes worldwide demonstrates a potential mechanism of introduction and highlights that additional incursions are likely unless action is taken to reduce the risk of pathogen translocation and spillover into wild snake populations.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInflammation is a risk factor for atherosclerosis progression. Hospitalisation for pneumonia is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Herein, we describe a multiple comorbidities murine model to study the impact of bacterial pneumonia on atherosclerosis.\n\nMethodsFirstly, a minimal infectious dose of Streptococcus pneumoniae (TIGR4 strain) to produce clinical pneumonia with a low mortality rate (20%) was established. C57Bl/6 ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet prior to administering intranasally 105 colony forming units of TIGR4 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). At days 2, 7 and 28 post inoculation (PI), the lungs of mice were imaged by MRI and PET. Mice were euthanised and investigated for changes in systemic inflammation and changes in lung morphology using ELISA, Luminex assay and real-time PCR.\n\nResultsTIGR4 inoculated mice presented with varying degreess of lung infiltrate, pleural effusion and consolidation on MRI at all timepoints up to 28 days PI. Moreover, PET scans identified significantly higher FDG uptake in the lungs of TIGR4 inoculated mice up to 28 days PI. Majority (90%) TIGR4-inoculated mice developed pneumococcal-specific IgG antibody response at 28 days PI. Consistent with these observations, TIGR4 inoculated mice displayed significantly increased inflammatory gene expression (IL-1{beta} & IL6) in the lungs and significantly increased levels of circulating inflammatory protein (CCL3) at 7- and 28-days PI respectively.\n\nConclusionsOur mouse model presents a discovery tool to understand the link between acute infections, including pneumonia, and increased cardiovascular disease risk in humans with inflammation as the mechanistic catalyst.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=138 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485412v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e76491org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17b712eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143b2f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@199dbe1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF168 is a rate-limiting component of DNA double-strand break signalling that acts to amplify histone ubiquitylation. The confining of RNF168 chromatin spreading around DNA break sites has been related to constraining its expression levels and to the removal of ubiquitin-conjugates to which it binds. Here we identify a new mechanism that suppresses RNF168 amplification at chromatin. We show that depletion of Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) or mutation of the Pin1-binding site of RNF168 increases DNA-damage site accumulation of RNF168 to supraphysiological levels without impacting RNF168 expression levels. Pin1 promotes SUMOylation of RNF168 by SUMO2/3, and a SUMO conjugation site on RNF168 is required to restrict RNF168 accumulations. We find Pin1-SUMO mediated-regulation of RNF168 is associated with cellular radioresistance. These data demonstrate that the regulation of chromatin ubiquitylation is actively suppressed by modification of RNF168 to counteract excessive RNF168-ubiquitin spreading.",

    "abstract": "Sam68 is a member of the STAR family of proteins that directly link signal transduction with post-transcriptional gene regulation. Sam68 controls the alternative splicing of many oncogenic proteins and its role is modulated by post-translational modifications, including serine/threonine phosphorylation, that differ at various stages of the cell cycle. However, the molecular basis and mechanisms of these modulations remain largely unknown. Here, we combined mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and cell biology techniques to provide a comprehensive post-translational modification (PTM) mapping of Sam68 at different stages of the cell cycle in HEK293 and HCT116 cells. We established that Sam68 is specifically phosphorylated at T33 and T317 by Cdk1, and demonstrated that these phosphorylation events reduce the binding of Sam68 to RNA, control its cellular localization, and reduce its alternative splicing activity, leading to a reduction in the induction of apoptosis and an increase in the proliferation of HCT116 cells.",

    "abstract": "Diseases adversely affect grain yield of crop plants. Leaf rust is a major disease of wheat. As race-specific resistance breaks down, introduction of newer sources of resistance often from older accessions is necessary. Linkage drag from the donor accessions adversely impacts grain yield. As a result, CIMMYT breeding effort has shifted to using durable resistance, also referred to as race non-specific host resistance, which allows slow rusting but maintains grain yield. One of the key genes for durable resistance is Lr67 and the resistant form of this gene is absent in CIMMYT elite lines. Hence, we have initiated efforts to convert the susceptible copy of Lr67 into its resistant form directly in these elite lines using gene editing. This would eliminate backcrossing and thus save time as well as eliminate linkage drag that would accompany the resistant copy of the gene if it were to be introgressed from an older accession. As first steps, we have isolated and sequenced the genomic copies from each of the A, B, and D genome of the Lr67 gene from three elite lines and an experimental line. Identification of more than 50 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the open reading frames (ORF) among these lines would be useful in designing the guide RNA molecules with precision. Further, we have streamlined genetic transformation of these elite lines, a prerequisite step for gene editing.",

We herein present the 2.8-2.9 [A]-resolution cryo-EM structures of a Golgi-localized human Zn2+/H+ antiporter ZnT7 (hZnT7) in its outward- and inward-facing forms. Cryo-EM analyses showed that hZnT7 exists as a homodimer via tight interactions in both the cytosolic and transmembrane (TM) regions of two protomers, each of which contains a single Zn2+-binding site in its TM domain. hZnT7 undergoes a TM-helix rearrangement to create a negatively charged cytosolic cavity for Zn2+ entry in the inward-facing form and a widened luminal cavity for Zn2+ release in the outward-facing form. An exceptionally long cytosolic histidine-rich loop characteristic of hZnT7 can bind at least two Zn2+ ions, likely facilitating Zn2+ recruitment from the cytosol. Unique mechanisms of hZnT7-mediated Zn2+ uptake into the Golgi are proposed.",

IVT mRNA is an attractive tool for biological experiments and drug discovery. To verify the protein expression of IVT mRNA in vitro, primary cultured human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) were transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA with or without m1{psi} incorporation. EGFP was detected using western blotting and fluorescence microscopy. A multiplex assay was performed to comprehensively understand IVT mRNA-induced immunogenicity. FLS transfected EGFP mRNA containing m1{psi} generated higher levels of EGFP than unmodified EGFP mRNA or control RNAs. The multiplex assay of the FLS culture supernatant revealed that concentrations of IL-6, TNF-, and CXCL10 were upregulated by unmodified EGFP mRNA, whereas they were suppressed by EGFP mRNA with m1{psi}. Overall, m1{psi} incorporation enhanced protein expression and decreased cytokine expressions in primary cultured FLS. The findings may contribute to arthritis research.",

However, its mechanism is still controversial in several tissues and species. Here, we developed a mathematical model linking these two models. Our theoretical analysis showed that the model with the hierarchy and neutral competition, called the hierarchical neutral competition (hNC) model, exhibited bursts in clonal expansion, unlike existing models. Furthermore, the scaling law in clone size distribution, thought to be a unique characteristic of the recent model, was satisfied in the hNC model. Based on these findings, we proposed a criterion for distinguishing the three models by experiments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPeroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1 alpha (PGC-1) acts as a transcriptional coactivator and regulates mitochondrial function. Various isoforms are generated by alternative splicing and differentially regulated promoters. In the heart, total PGC-1 deficiency knockout leads to dilatative cardiomyopathy, but knowledge on the complexity of cardiac isoform expression of PGC-1 remains sparse. Thus, this study aims to generate a reliable dataset on cardiac isoform expression pattern by long-read mRNA sequencing, followed by investigation of differential regulation of PGC-1 isoforms under metabolic and ischemic stress, using high-fat-high-sucrose-diet-induced obesity and a murine model of myocardial infarction.\n\nMethods and ResultsMurine (C57Bl/6J) or human heart tissue (obtained during LVAD-surgery), was used for long-read mRNA sequencing, resulting in full-length transcriptomes including 58,000 mRNA isoforms with 99% sequence accuracy. Automatic bioinformatic analysis as well as manual similarity search against exonic sequences lead to identification of putative coding PGC-1 isoforms, validated by PCR and Sanger-Sequencing. Thereby, 12 novel transcripts generated by hitherto unknown splicing events were detected. In addition, we postulate a novel promoter with homologous and strongly-conserved sequence in human heart. High-fat-diet as well as ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury transiently reduced cardiac expression of PGC-1-isoforms, with the most pronounced effect in the infarcted area. Recovery of PGC-1-isoform expression was even more decelerated when I/R was performed in diet-induced obese mice.\n\nConclusionsWe deciphered for the first time a complete full-length-transcriptome of the murine and human heart, identifying novel putative PGC-1 coding transcripts including a novel promoter. These transcripts are differentially regulated in I/R and obesity suggesting transcriptional regulation and alternative splicing that may modulate PGC-1 function in the injured and metabolically challenged heart.",

    "abstract": "Sex determination occurs across animal species, but most of our knowledge about the mechanisms of sex determination comes from only a handful of bilaterian taxa. This limits our ability to infer the evolutionary history of sex determination within animals. In this study, we generated a linkage map of the genome of the colonial cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus and used this map to determine that this species has an XX/XY sex determination system. We delineate the pseudoautosomal and non-recombining regions of the Y chromosome and show that the latter encodes a number of genes with male gonad-specific expression. These findings establish Hydractinia as a tractable non-bilaterian model system for the study of sex determination.\n\nSignificance StatementWhat determines whether an animal is male or female? The answer depends on the species. Some rely on signals from their environment, while others take cues from their genome. Most of what we understand about sex determination comes from traditional model organisms (such as mice, flies, and worms) or groups of well-studied vertebrates and insects. Studying sex determination in other animals, especially those from phyla that diverged early in animal evolution, would allow us to better understand how sex has evolved across the animal kingdom and could reveal pathways present in the eumetazoan ancestor >600 million years ago. In this study, we show that the cnidarian Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus has XY sex determination, establishing this species as a model system for sex determination in an understudied group of animals.",

    "abstract": "Delineating the relative influence of genotype and the environment on DNA methylation is critical for characterizing the spectrum of organism fitness as driven by adaptation and phenotypic plasticity. In this study, we integrated genomic and DNA methylation data for two distinct Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) populations while controlling for within-generation environmental influences. In addition to providing the first characterization of genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in the oyster genus Ostrea, we identified 3,963 differentially methylated loci between populations. Our results show a clear coupling between genetic and epigenetic patterns of variation, with 27% of variation in inter-individual methylation differences explained by genotype. Underlying this association are both direct genetic changes in CpGs (CpG-SNPs) and genetic variation with indirect influence on methylation (mQTLs). The association between genetic and epigenetic patterns breaks down when comparing measures of population divergence at specific genomic regions, which has implications for the methods used to study epigenetic and genetic coupling in marine invertebrates.\n\nSignificance statementWe know that genotype and epigenetic patterns are primarily responsible for phenotype, yet there is a lack of understanding to what degree the two are linked. Here we characterized the mechanisms and the degree by which genetic variation and DNA methylation variation are coupled in a marine invertebrate, with almost a third of the methylation variation attributable to genotype. This study provides a framework for future studies in environmental epigenetics to take genetic variation into account when teasing apart the drivers of phenotypic variation. By identifying methylation variation that cannot be attributed to genotype or environmental changes during development, our results also highlight the need for future research to characterize molecular mechanisms adjacent to genetic adaptation for producing long-term shifts in phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Filter paper provides an excellent matrix for retention of proteins containing a cellulose binding domain. To use this capability for manipulating recombinant fusion proteins, binding and elution parameters were explored and procedures developed for small scale purification, modification and assay. Proteins were tagged with the cellulose binding domain from the C thermocellum CipB gene via a cleavable linker. Filter paper disks of 6mm diameter were able to bind up to 80 g protein although there was a substantial dependence on molecular size. Different means of introducing fusion proteins to the disks allow either binding within 20 minutes from microliter volumes or slower binding from milliliter volumes. Elution with protease in small volumes yielded greater than 10 g amounts with concentrations in the 1-2 mg/ml range. To demonstrate their utility, disks were used for small scale protein purification, covalent modification of protein, immunoprecipitation, and in a binding assay. These versatile methods allow parallel processing of multiple samples and may find many uses when only small amounts of protein are needed.",

    "abstract": "Many of the machine learning (ML) models used in the field of bioinformatics and computational biology to predict either function or structure of proteins rely on the evolutionary information as summarized in multiple-sequence alignments (MSAs) or the resulting position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), as generated by PSI-BLAST. The current procedure used in protein structure and function prediction is computationally exhaustive and time-consuming. The main issue relies on the PSI-BLAST software being forced to load the current database of sequences (about 220 GB) in batches and search for similar sequence alignments to a query sequence. This leads to an average runtime of about 40-60 min for a medium-sized (450 Amino Acids) query protein. This average runtime is strictly dependent on the hardware used to run the software. The issue is becoming more problematic since the bio-sequence data pools are increasing in size exponentially over time, hence raising PSI-BLAST runtime as well. A prominent solution claims to speed up the current process by 100 folds. The MMseqs2 method, given enough memory, will load the whole database in memory and apply certain heuristics to retrieve the relevant set of aligned sequences. However, this solution cannot be used directly to generate the final output in the desired PSI-BLAST alignment and PSSM profile data format. In this research project, we analyzed the runtime performance of each tool separately. Furthermore, we built a pipeline that combines both MMseqs2 and PSI-BLAST to obtain a robust, optimized and very fast hybrid alignment tool, faster than PSI-BLAST by two orders of magnitude. It is implemented in C++ and is freely available under the MIT license at https://github.com/issararab/IsarPipeline. The output of our pipeline was evaluated on two previously built predictive models.",

However, the assumption that CRISPR screens are saturating has been largely untested. Through integrated analysis of screen data in cancer cell lines generated by the Cancer Dependency Map, we show that a typical CRISPR screen has a [~]20% false negative rate, in addition to library-specific false negatives. Replicability falls sharply as gene expression decreases, while cancer subtype-specific genes within a tissue show distinct profiles compared to false negatives. Cumulative analyses across tissues improves our understanding of core essential genes and suggest only a small number of lineage-specific essential genes, enriched for transcription factors that define pathways of tissue differentiation. To recover false negatives, we introduce a method, Joint Log Odds of Essentiality (JLOE), which builds on our prior work with BAGEL to selectively rescue the false negatives without an increased false discovery rate.",

    "abstract": "Chronic activation of inflammatory pathways and suppressed interferon signaling are hallmarks of myeloid cells in immunosuppressive tumors that drive poor responsiveness to conventional and immune therapies. Previous studies have identified agonistic activation of the CD11b integrin as a potential strategy to enhance anti-tumor immunity. However, the mechanisms by which CD11b-agonism reprogram tumor immunity are poorly understood, and this may impair patient selection and identification of effective treatment combinations. Herein we used a combination of in vitro systems, animal models, and samples from first in human clinical trials of the CD11b-agonist GB1275 to identify the mechanism of action of this approach and identify combinations for further testing. We found that CD11b agonism altered tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) phenotypes by simultaneously repressing NF{kappa}B/IL1-signaling and activating interferon (IFN) gene expression. Repression of NF{kappa}B/IL-1 signaling was due to rapid degradation of p65 protein by the proteosome and was not context dependent. In contrast, CD11b agonism triggered mitochondrial dysfunction to stimulate STING-induced, STAT1-mediated interferon signaling. The magnitude of CD11b agonist induction of STING/IFN signaling was dependent on the tumor microenvironment and was significantly amplified by cytotoxic therapies. Using tissues from phase I clinical trials, we demonstrated that GB1275 treatment activated STING and STAT1 signaling in TAMs in human tumors. Together, these mechanisms allowed macrophages to augment anti-tumor T cell immunity. These studies identified potential mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for CD11b agonist use and identified potential patient populations more likely to benefit from them.\n\nStatement of significanceCD11b agonists are a novel approach to reprogram myeloid cells in solid tumors. We show that GB1275, a CD11b-agonist, amplified STING/IFN signaling in TAMs to support anti-tumor immunity and this signaling is amplified further by cytotoxic therapy. These studies support new treatment strategies for advanced solid tumors with myeloid immunosuppression.",

    "abstract": "Glioma is a malignant brain tumor that is highly resistant to radiation and chemotherapy, where patients survive on average only 15 months after diagnosis. Furthering the understanding of mechanisms leading to radiation resistance of glioma is paramount to identify novel therapeutic targets. Previous studies have shown that glioma stem cells (GSCs) play an important role in promoting radiation resistance and disease recurrence. Herein we analyze the proteomic alterations occurring in patient-derived GSCs upon radiation treatment in order to identify molecular drivers of resistance. We show that proteome changes upon radiation accurately predict the resistance status of the cells, whereas resistance to radiation does not correlate with glioma transcriptional subtypes. We further show that the radio-resistant GSC-267 cell line sheds microvesicles (MVs) enriched in the metabolic enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). These MVs can be transferred to recipient fibroblasts and radio-sensitive GSCs, enhancing their intracellular total NAD+ and NADH level, and their ability to proliferate when cultured in low serum, treated with a radio-mimetic drug or irradiated. The NAMPT enzymatic inhibitor FK-866 blocked the ability of MVs from GSC-267 cells to mediate these effects. Similarly, GSC-267 cells where NAMPT was knocked-down using shRNA, which produced MVs depleted of this enzyme, were unable to promote cell proliferation. Collectively, our findings demonstrates that proteome-level regulation can accurately predict the radio-resistance status of GSCs, and identifies NAMPT transfer via MVs as a mechanism for spreading radiation resistance within the glioma tumor microenvironment.\n\nSignificanceThe highly aggressive and deadly brain cancer glioma is commonly resistant to standard chemo- and radio-therapy. We used systems biology approaches to study patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs), which are known to be responsible for therapeutic resistance, and cell-to-cell communication mediated by extracellular vesicles (EVs), which plays an important role in tumor progression. Analysis of the proteome of GSCs and of the EVs they release led us to determine that the EV-mediated transfer of the metabolic enzyme nicotinamide phosphorybosyltransferase (NAMPT) from radio-resistant to less aggressive cells confers resistance to radiation. Our findings identify a mechanism of therapy resistance in glioma, and suggest that NAMPT inhibition could enhance the efficacy of radiation for the treatment of glioma.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic gene circuits require cellular resources, which are often limited. This leads to competition for resources by different genes, which alter a synthetic genetic circuits behavior. However, the manner in which competition impacts behavior depends on the identity of the \"bottleneck\" resource which might be difficult to discern from input-output data. In this paper, we aim at classifying the mathematical structures of resource competition in biochemical circuits. We find that some competition structures can be distinguished by their response to different competitors or resource levels. Specifically, we show that some response curves are always linear, convex, or concave. Furthermore, high levels of certain resources protect the behavior from low competition, while others do not. We also show that competition phenotypes respond differently to various interventions. Such differences can be used to eliminate candidate competition mechanisms when constructing models based on given data. On the other hand, we show that different networks can display mathematically equivalent competition phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Pyrin is a pattern-recognition receptor in phagocytes that triggers capase-1 inflammasome assembly in response to bacterial toxins and effectors that inactivate RhoA. Pyrin contains oligomerization domains and is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of two residues, S205 and S241 (murine) or S208 and S242 (human), via the kinases PKN1/2, which are activated by RhoA. Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is caused by phagocyte production of pyrin gain of function variants, which have a lower threshold for inflammasome assembly upon RhoA-PKN axis inhibition. Inactivation of the RhoA-PKN axis removes negative regulation but a phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) is needed to positively regulate pyrin. No PPP that dephosphorylates pyrin has been identified, oligomerization of murine pyrin has not been studied, and the phosphorylation status of oligomeric pyrin is unknown. We used murine macrophages and FMF patients monocytes combined with the use of bacterial agonists and chemical inhibitors, native PAGE, phospho-specific antibodies and siRNA knockdowns to determine if a PPP positively regulates oligomeric pyrin. Results with broadly-specific inhibitors indicate that PPP activity is required to dephosphorylate murine and human pyrin in wild type or FMF patients phagocytes. Findings from native PAGE show that murine pyrin forms oligomers that are phosphorylated on S205 prior to RhoA inactivation. Inhibitors cause reduced mobility of murine pyrin on native PAGE and hyperphosphorylation of S242 in human pyrin, suggesting a PPP constitutively counterbalances PKN to keep the second site hypophosphorylated. Data from siRNA knockdown experiments implicate PP2A in dephosphorylation of S205 and positive regulation of pyrin in response to RhoA inactivation.\n\nKey pointsMurine pyrin is oligomeric and phosphorylated on S205 prior to inflammasome assembly\n\nPPP activity positively regulates pyrin inflammasome assembly in mice and humans\n\nThe alpha and beta subunits of PP2A dephosphorylate murine pyrin S205 in macrophages",

    "abstract": "1.1.The human gut is a dense microbial community, of which bacteria and bacteriophages are the majority. Bacteriophages, viruses of bacteria, exist stably, without major fluctuations in the gut of healthy individuals. This stability appears to be due to an absence of  kill-the-winner dynamics, and the existence of  piggy-back-the-winner dynamics, where lysogenic replication rather than lytic replication occurs. Revisiting the deep-viral sequencing data of a healthy individual studied over 2.4 years, we were able to improve our understanding of how these dynamics occur in healthy individuals. We assembled prophages from bacterial metagenomic data and show that these prophages were continually switching from lysogenic to lytic replication. Prophages were the source of a stable extracellular phage population continually present in low abundance, in comparison to the lytic-phage population, where taxonomic diversity diverged over 2.4 years. The switch to lytic replication, or prophage induction, appears to occur mostly through spontaneous prophage induction. The observed phage dynamics of regular spontaneous induction are ecologically important as they allow prophages to maintain their ability to replicate, avoiding degradation and their loss from the gut microbiota.\n\n1.2. Significance StatementIt has been eight years since Minot and colleagues published their landmark longitudinal study of phages in the gut. In the years following, the bioinformatic field improved in great strides, including the methods of bacterial-genome assembly, phage-identification, and prophage detection. We leveraged the unprecedented deep sequencing of phages in this dataset by adding bacterial assembly and prophage detection analyzes. We show clearly for the first time that  piggy-back-the-winner dynamics are maintained in the gut through spontaneous prophage induction, and not widespread triggered prophage induction. These dynamics play an important ecological role by creating a stable subpopulation of phages, which could help explain how phages are maintained over the 2.4 years timeframe that this individual was studied.",

    "abstract": "SPACA6 is a sperm-expressed surface protein that is critical for gamete fusion during mammalian sexual reproduction. Despite this fundamental role, little is known about how SPACA6 specifically functions. We elucidated the crystal structure of SPACA6 at 2.2-[A] resolution, revealing a two-domain protein containing a four-helix bundle and Ig-like {beta}-sandwich connected via a quasi-flexible linker. Based on the structural analysis, we propose SPACA6 is a founding member of a superfamily of gamete fusion-associated proteins, herein dubbed the IST superfamily. The IST superfamily is defined structurally by its distorted four-helix bundle and a pair of disulfide-bonded CXXC motifs. A structure-based search of the AlphaFold human proteome identified more protein members to this superfamily; remarkably, many of these proteins are linked to gamete fusion. The SPACA6 structure and its connection to other IST-superfamily members provide a missing link in our knowledge of mammalian gamete fusion.\n\nSignificance StatementSPACA6 is a human sperm protein vital for the fusion of gametes, though its exact function remains a mystery. We present the first solved structure of SPACA6: a two-domain fold comprised of an Ig-like domain and a distorted four-helix bundle. Dali searches of the PDB and AlphaFold reveal a family of structurally related proteins, several of which are also known to play a role in gamete fusion; as such, SPACA6 is a founding member of a conserved protein superfamily, dubbed the IST superfamily.

    "abstract": "Crosses between D. simulans females and D. melanogaster males produce viable F1 sons and poorly viable F1 daughters. Unlike most hybrid incompatibilities, this hybrid incompatibility violates Haldanes rule, the observation that incompatibilities preferentially affect the heterogametic sex. Further, it is important to understand fully the genetic basis of this incompatibility because the causal allele in D. melanogaster is a large species-specific block of complex satellite DNA on its X chromosome known as the 359-bp satellite, rather than a protein-coding locus. The causal allele(s) in D. simulans are unknown but likely involve maternally expressed genes or factors since the F1 females die during early embryogenesis. The maternal haploid (mh) gene is an intriguing candidate because it is expressed maternally and its protein product localizes to the 359-bp repeat. We found that this gene has diverged extensively between D. melanogaster and D. simulans. This observation led to the hypothesis that D. melanogaster mh may have co-evolved with the 359-bp repeat, and that hybrid incompatibility thus results from the absence of a co-evolved mh allele in D. simulans. We tested for functional divergence of mh by creating matched transformants of D. melanogaster and D. simulans orthologs in both D. melanogaster and D. simulans strains. Surprisingly, we find that D. simulans mh fully complements the female sterile phenotype of D. melanogaster mh mutations. Contrary to our hypothesis, we find no evidence that adding a D. melanogaster mh gene to D. simulans increases hybrid viability.",

    "abstract": "The Fusarium solani species complex (FSSC) comprises fungal pathogens responsible for mortality in a diverse range of animals and plants, but their genome diversity and transcriptome responses in animal pathogenicity remain to be elucidated. We sequenced and compared six chromosome-level FSSC clade 3 genomes of aquatic animal and plant host origins and revealed a spectrum of conservation patterns in chromosomes categorised into three compartments: core, fast-core (FC), and lineage-specific (LS). Each chromosome type varied in structural architectures, with FC and LS chromosomes containing significantly higher proportions of repetitive elements and methylation levels than core chromosomes, with genes exhibiting higher dN/dS and enriched in functions related to pathogenicity and niche expansion. Mesosynteny were detected between FC chromosomes of Fusarium genomes, indicating that these chromosomes were present in a common ancestor that predated FSSC species. These findings provide evidence that genome compartmentalisation was the outcome of multi-speed evolution amongst FSSC chromosomes. We further demonstrated that F. falciforme and F. keratoplasticum are opportunistic pathogens by inoculating Pelodiscus sinensis eggs and identified differentially expressed genes also associated with plant pathogenicity. These included the most upregulated genes encoding the CFEM (Common in Fungal Extracellular Membrane) domain. The study establishes genomic resources and an animal model for fungal pathogens of trans-kingdom hosts.",

    "abstract": "Isolation of copy number variations and chromosomal duplications at high frequency in the laboratory suggested that Caenorhabditis elegans tolerates increased gene dosage. Here we addressed if a general dosage compensation mechanism acts at the level of mRNA expression in C. elegans. We characterized gene dosage and mRNA expression in three chromosomal duplications and a fosmid integration strain using DNA-seq and mRNA-seq. Our results show that on average, increased gene dosage leads to increased mRNA expression, pointing to a lack of genome-wide dosage compensation. Different genes within the same chromosomal duplication show variable levels of mRNA increase, suggesting feedback regulation of individual genes. Somatic dosage compensation and germline repression reduce the level of mRNA increase from X chromosomal duplications. Together, our results show a lack of genome-wide dosage compensation mechanism acting at the mRNA level in C. elegans and highlight the role of epigenetic and individual gene regulation contributing to the varied consequences of increased gene dosage.",

    "abstract": "Aging of mice can be tracked by DNA methylation changes at specific sites in the genome. In this study, we used the recently released Infinium Mouse Methylation BeadChip to compare such epigenetic modifications in C57BL/6 (B6) and DBA/2J (DBA) mice. We observed marked differences in age-associated DNA methylation in these commonly used inbred mouse strains, indicating that epigenetic clocks for one strain cannot be simply applied to other strains without further verification. In B6 mice age-associated hypomethylation prevailed with focused hypermethylation at CpG islands, whereas in DBA mice CpG islands revealed rather hypomethylation upon aging. Interestingly, the CpGs with highest age-correlation were still overlapping in B6 and DBA mice and included the genes Hsf4, Prima1, Aspa, and Wnt3a. Notably, Hsf4 and Prima1 were also top candidates in previous studies based on whole genome deep sequencing approaches. Furthermore, Hsf4, Aspa, and Wnt3a revealed highly significant age-associated DNA methylation in the homologous regions in human. Subsequently, we used pyrosequencing of the four relevant regions to establish a targeted epigenetic clock that provided very high correlation with chronological age in independent cohorts of B6 (R2 = 0.98) and DBA (R2 = 0.91). Taken together, the methylome differs extensively between B6 and DBA mice, while prominent age-associated changes are conserved among these strains and even in humans. Our new targeted epigenetic clock with 4 CpGs provides a versatile tool for other researchers analyzing aging in mice.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceDiffuse in vivo flow cytometry (DiFC) is an emerging technology for fluorescence detection of rare circulating cells directly in large deep-seated blood vessels in mice. Because DiFC uses highly scattered light, in principle it could be translated to human use. However, an open question is whether fluorescent signals from single cells would be detectable in human-scale anatomies.\n\nAimSuitable blood vessels in a human wrist or forearm are at a depth of approximately 2-4 mm. The aim of this work was to study the impact of DiFC instrument geometry and wavelength on the detected DiFC signal and on the maximum depth of detection of a moving cell.\n\nApproachWe used Monte Carlo simulations to compute Jacobian (sensitivity) matrices for a range of source-detector separations and tissue optical properties over the visible and near infrared (NIR) spectrum. We performed experimental measurements with three available versions of DiFC (488 nm, 640 nm, and 780 nm), fluorescent microspheres, and tissue mimicking optical flow phantoms. We used both computational and experimental data to estimate the maximum depth of detection at each combination of settings.\n\nResults and ConclusionsFor the DiFC detection problem, our analysis showed that for deep-seated blood vessels, the maximum sensitivity was obtained with NIR light (780 nm) and 3 mm source-and-detector separation. These results suggest that - in combination with a suitable molecularly targeted fluorescent probes - circulating cells and nanosensors could in principle be detectable in circulation in humans.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) can provide spatial information about DNA/RNA targets in fixed cells and tissues. However, the workflows of multiplexed FISH-based imaging that use sequential rounds of hybridization quickly become laborious as the number of rounds increases because of liquid handling demands. Here, we present an open-source and low-cost fluidics system that is purpose built for automating the workflows of sequential FISH-based imaging. Our system features a fluidics module with 16 addressable channels in which flow is positive pressure-driven and switched on/off by solenoid valves in order to transfer FISH reagents to the sample. Our system also includes a controller with a main printed circuit board that can control up to 120 solenoid valves and allows users to control the fluidics module via serial communication. We demonstrate the automatic and robust fluid exchange with this system by targeting the alpha satellite repeat in HeLa cell with 14 rounds of sequential hybridization and imaging. We anticipate that this simple and flexible system will be of utility to researchers performing multiplexed in situ assays in a range of experimental systems.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/485524v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (75K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19812f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104e5b5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@84d1acorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e19d87_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Specifications table\n\nO_TBL View this table:\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12d112forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c3515forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@135ce2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13709e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@69bf82_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_TBL C_TBL",

    "abstract": "Relative protein quantification is a well-established technique in the vast majority of the molecular biology laboratories. However, western blot standard protocols may be unable to detect certain proteins depending on their size. When the protein of interest is out of 10-250 KDa range, its migration through the gel or transfer to the membrane are compromised, thus making its detection difficult. Here we present a set of modifications of the standard working procedure for western blotting based on the experience working with Small VCP Interacting Protein (SVIP) and Max-Gene Associated Protein (MGA), whose molecular weight are 8 and 350 kDa, respectively. We expect that these adaptations may help researchers to improve their experiments in a cost-effective manner.",

    "abstract": "The Major Facilitator Superfamily (MFS) includes multiple families of proteins operating as uniporters, symporters and antiporters for a wide spectrum of substrates. Among them, the multidrug resistance-1 drug:H+ antiporter CaMdr1 from Candida albicans is responsible for the efflux of structurally-diverse antifungals. MFS share a common fold of 12-14 transmembrane helices (TMHs) forming two N- and C-domains. Each domain is arranged in a pseudo symmetric fold of two tandems of 3-TMHs that alternatively expose the drug-binding site towards the inside or the outside of the yeast to promote drug binding and release. MFS show a high primary structure diversity and few conserved Signature motifs, each thought to have a common function in the superfamily, although not yet clearly established. Here, we provide new information on these motifs by having screened a library of 64 drug transport-deficient mutants and their corresponding suppressors spontaneously rescuing the deficiency. We found that five strains recovered the drug-resistance capacity by expressing CaMdr1 with a secondary mutation. The pairs of debilitating/rescuing residues are distributed either in the same TMH (T127ATMH1->G140DTMH1) or 3-TMHs repeat (F216ATMH4->G260ATMH5), at the hinge of 3-TMHs repeats tandems (R184ATMH3->D235HTMH4, L480ATMH10->A435TTMH9), and finally between the N- and C-domains (G230ATMH4->P528HTMH12). Remarkably, most of these mutants belongs to the different Signature motifs, highlighting a mechanistic role and interplay thought to be conserved among MFS. Results point also to the specific role of TMH11 in the interplay between the N- and C-domains in the inward- to outward-open conformational transition.",
