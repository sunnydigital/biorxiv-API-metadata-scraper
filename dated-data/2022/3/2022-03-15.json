    "abstract": "Much of our understanding of navigation comes from the study of individual species, often with specific tasks tailored to those species. Here, we provide a novel experimental and analytic framework, integrating across humans, rats and simulated reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interrogate the dynamics of behaviour during spatial navigation. We developed a novel open-field navigation task (Tartarus Maze) requiring dynamic adaptation (shortcuts and detours) to frequently changing obstructions in the path to a hidden goal. Humans and rats were remarkably similar in their trajectories. Both species showed the greatest similarity to RL agents utilising a successor representation, which creates a predictive map. Humans also displayed trajectory features similar to model-based RL agents, which implemented an optimal tree-search planning procedure. Our results help refine models seeking to explain mammalian navigation in dynamic environments, and highlight the utility of modelling the behaviour of different species to uncover the shared mechanisms that support behaviour.",

    "abstract": "In the mammalian brain, allocentric representations support efficient self-location and flexible navigation. A number of distinct populations of these spatial responses have been identified but no unified function has been shown to account for their emergence. Here we developed a network, trained with a simple predictive objective, that was capable of mapping egocentric information into an allocentric spatial reference frame. The prediction of visual inputs was sufficient to drive the appearance of spatial representations resembling those observed in rodents: head direction, boundary vector, and place cells, along with the recently discovered egocentric boundary cells, suggesting predictive coding as a principle for their emergence in animals. Strikingly, the network learned a solution for head direction tracking and stabilisation convergent with known biological connectivity. Moreover, like mammalian representations, responses were robust to environmental manipulations, including exposure to novel settings. In contrast to existing reinforcement learning approaches, agents equipped with this network were able to flexibly reuse learnt behaviours --adapting rapidly to unfamiliar environments. Thus, our results indicate that these representations, derived from a simple egocentric predictive framework, form an efficient basis-set for cognitive mapping.",

    "abstract": "Much of the Ca2+ activity in astrocytes is spatially restricted to microdomains and occurs in fine processes that form a complex anatomical meshwork, the so-called spongiform domain. A growing body of literature indicates that those astrocytic Ca2+ signals can influence the activity of neuronal synapses and thus tune the flow of information through neuronal circuits. Because of technical difficulties in accessing the small spatial scale involved, the role of astrocyte morphology on Ca2+ microdomain activity remains poorly understood. Here, we use computational tools and idealized 3D geometries of fine processes based on recent super-resolution microscopy data to investigate the mechanistic link between astrocytic nanoscale morphology and local Ca2+ activity. Simulations demonstrate that the nano-morphology of astrocytic processes powerfully shapes the spatio-temporal properties of Ca2+ signals and promotes local Ca2+ activity. The model predicts that this effect is attenuated upon astrocytic swelling, hallmark of brain diseases, which we confirm experimentally in hypo-osmotic conditions. Upon repeated neurotransmitter release events, the model predicts that swelling hinders astrocytic signal propagation. Overall, this study highlights the influence of the complex morphology of astrocytes at the nanoscale and its remodeling in pathological conditions on neuron-astrocyte communication at so-called tripartite synapses, where astrocytic processes come into close contact with pre- and postsynaptic structures.\n\nTable of ContentsO_ST_ABSMain PointsC_ST_ABSO_LIAstrocyte nano-morphology favors the compartmentalization of biochemical signals\nC_LIO_LIThis compartmentalization promotes local Ca2+ activity and signal propagation robustness\nC_LIO_LIIn contrast, its pathological remodeling upon swelling attenuates Ca2+ activity\nC_LI\n\nTable of Contents Image\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=102 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/432635v4_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22b80forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1621218org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@191e971org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@751637_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1:C_FLOATNO Proposed mechanisms that regulate astrocytic Ca2+ activity in perisynaptic astrocytic processes.\n\nOur simulation results demonstrate that the nano-morphology of astrocytic processes, consisting in the alternation of nodes and shafts, favors the compartmentalization of biochemical signals. This compartmentalization promotes local Ca2+ activity and signal propagation robustness. Astrocyte swelling, observed in pathological conditions such as brain injury, stroke and epilepsy, results in an increased shaft width without altering node size. Our results suggest that such pathological alterations of the nanoscale morphology of astrocytes result in a decreased local Ca2+ activity, which we confirm experimentally in hypo-osmotic conditions. Upon repeated neuronal stimuli, we predict that swelling hinders astrocytic signal propagation. Overall, this study highlights the impact of astrocyte nano-morphology on astrocyte activity at tripartite synapses, in health and disease.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Cell division, wherein one cell divides into two daughter cells, is fundamental to all living organisms. Cytokinesis, the final step in cell division, begins with the formation of an actomyosin contractile ring, positioned midway between the segregated chromosomes. Constriction of the ring with concomitant membrane deposition in a spatiotemporal manner generates a cleavage furrow that physically separates the cytoplasm. Unique lipids with specific biophysical properties have been shown to localize to intercellular bridges (also called midbody) connecting the two dividing cells; however, their biological roles and delivery mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that Ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE), the structural analog of sphingomyelin, has unique acyl chain anchors in spermatocytes and is essential for meiotic cytokinesis. The head group of CPE is also important for spermatogenesis. We find that aberrant central spindle and contractile ring behavior but not mislocalization of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) at the plasma membrane is responsible for the male meiotic cytokinesis defect in CPE deficient animals. Further, we demonstrate the enrichment of CPE in multivesicular bodies marked by Rab7, which in turn localize to cleavage furrow. Volume electron microscopy analysis using correlative light and focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy shows that CPE enriched Rab7 positive endosomes are juxtaposed on contractile ring material. Correlative light and transmission electron microscopy reveal Rab7 positive endosomes as a multivesicular body-like organelle that releases its intraluminal vesicles in the vicinity of ingressing furrows. Genetic ablation of Rab7 or expression of dominant negative Rab11 results in significant meiotic cytokinesis defects. Our results imply that endosomal delivery of CPE to ingressing membranes is crucial for meiotic cytokinesis.",

    "abstract": "Cortical and basal ganglia circuits play a crucial role in the formation of goal-directed and habitual behaviors. In this study, we investigate the cortico-striatal circuitry involved in learning and the role of this circuitry in the emergence of inflexible behaviors such as those observed in addiction. Specifically, we develop a computational model of cortico-striatal interactions that performs concurrent goal-directed and habit learning. The model accomplishes this by distinguishing learning processes in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS) that rely on reward prediction error signals as distinct from the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) where learning is supported by salience signals. These striatal subregions each operate on unique cortical input: the DMS receives input from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) which represents outcomes, and the DLS receives input from the premotor cortex which determines action selection. Following an initial learning of a two-alternative forced choice task, we subjected the model to reversal learning, reward devaluation, and learning a punished outcome. Behavior driven by stimulus-response associations in the DLS resisted goal-directed learning of new reward feedback rules despite devaluation or punishment, indicating the expression of habit. We repeated these simulations after the impairment of executive control, which was implemented as poor outcome representation in the PFC. The degraded executive control reduced the efficacy of goal-directed learning, and stimulus-response associations in the DLS were even more resistant to the learning of new reward feedback rules. In summary, this model describes how circuits of the dorsal striatum are dynamically engaged to control behavior and how the impairment of executive control by the PFC enhances inflexible behavior.\n\nAuthor SummarySubstance abuse changes an animals brain so that it is not able to appropriately respond to new environmental cues such as negative consequences for drug use. It is thought that the transition from adaptive to inflexible responding involves the inappropriate engagement of neural circuitry responsible for habit. In this study, we model neural circuitry that is critical for adaptive responding to changes in reward feedback to animal behavior. We extended previous computational models of the basal ganglia to incorporate detailed biophysical representations of the dorsomedial striatum, which is critical for goal-directed behavior, and the dorsolateral striatum, which is critical for habitual behavior. The model exhibited learning in simulations of reward reversal, devaluation, and punished outcome tasks. Recent work from our group has quantified the impairment of executive control in cortical activity of compulsively drinking rats. Here, we challenged the model in additional simulations by implementing the impairment of executive control as a reduction in the fidelity of prefrontal cortical outcome representations. Our results illustrate how impaired executive control reduces the performance of goal-directed learning and, hence, reduces the models ability to overcome an established habitual response.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAbrupt cessation of therapy with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) is associated with a discontinuation syndrome, typified by numerous disabling symptoms including anxiety. Surprisingly little is known of the behavioural effect of SSRI discontinuation in animals.\n\nAimHere, the effect of SSRI discontinuation on anxiety-like behaviour was systematically investigated in mice.\n\nMethodsExperiments were based on a 3-arm experimental design comprising saline, continued SSRI and discontinued SSRI. Mice were assessed 2 days after SSRI discontinuation over a 5 day period using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and other anxiety tests.\n\nResultsAn exploratory experiment found cessation of paroxetine (12 days) was associated with decreased open arm exploration and reduced total distance travelled, in male but not female mice. Follow-up studies confirmed a discontinuation effect on the EPM in male mice after paroxetine (12 days) and also citalopram (12 days). Mice receiving continued paroxetine (but not citalopram) also showed decreased open arm exploration but this was dissociable from effects of discontinuation. The discontinuation response to paroxetine did not strengthen after 28 days treatment but was absent after 7 days treatment. A discontinuation response was not decernable in other anxiety and fear-learning tests applied 3-5 days after treatment cessation. Finally, discontinuation effects on the EPM were typically associated with decreased locomotion on the test. However, separate locomotor testing implicated anxiety-provoked behavioural inhibition rather than a general reduction in motor activity.\n\nConclusionOverall, the current study provides evidence for a short-lasting behavioural discontinuation response to cessation of SSRI treatment in mice.",

    "abstract": "Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is the most valuable farmed fish globally and there is much interest in optimizing its genetics and rearing conditions for growth and feed efficiency. Marine feed ingredients must be replaced to meet global demand, with challenges for fish health and sustainability. Metabolic models can address this by connecting genomes to metabolism, which converts nutrients in the feed to energy and biomass, but such models are currently not available for major aquaculture species such as salmon. We present SALARECON, a model focusing on energy, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism that links the Atlantic salmon genome to metabolic fluxes and growth. It performs well in standardized tests and captures expected metabolic (in)capabilities. We show that it can explain observed hypoxic growth in terms of metabolic fluxes and apply it to aquaculture by simulating growth with commercial feed ingredients. Predicted limiting amino acids and feed efficiencies agree with data, and the model suggests that marine feed efficiency can be achieved by supplementing a few amino acids to plant- and insect-based feeds. SALARECON is a high-quality model that makes it possible to simulate Atlantic salmon metabolism and growth. It can be used to explain Atlantic salmon physiology and address key challenges in aquaculture such as development of sustainable feeds.\n\nAuthor summaryAtlantic salmon aquaculture generates billions of euros annually, but faces challenges of sustainability. Salmon are carnivores by nature, and fish oil and fish meal have become scarce resources in fish feed production. Novel, sustainable feedstuffs are being trialed hand in hand with studies of the genetics of growth and feed efficiency. This calls for a mathematical-biological framework to integrate data with understanding of the effects of novel feeds on salmon physiology and its interplay with genetics. We have developed the SALARECON model of the core salmon metabolic reaction network, linking its genome to metabolic fluxes and growth. Computational analyses show good agreement with observed growth, amino acid limitations, and feed efficiencies, illustrating the potential for in silico studies of potential feed mixtures. In particular, in silico screening of possible diets will enable more efficient animal experiments with improved knowledge gain. We have adopted best practices for test-driven development, virtual experiments to assay metabolic capabilities, revision control, and FAIR data and model management. This facilitates fast, collaborative, reliable development of the model for future applications in sustainable production biology.",

    "abstract": "Pavlovian fear conditioning is a widely used behavioral paradigm for studying associative learning in rodents. Despite early recognition that subjects may engage in a variety of both conditioned and unconditioned responses, the last several decades have seen the field narrow its focus to measure freezing as the sole indicator of conditioned fear. We previously reported that female rats were more likely than males to engage in darting, an escape-like conditioned response that is associated with heightened shock reactivity. To determine how experimental parameters contribute to the frequency of darting in both males and females, we manipulated factors such as chamber size, shock intensity, and number of trials. To better capture fear-related behavioral repertoires in our animals, we developed ScaredyRat, an open-source custom Python tool that analyzes Noldus Ethovision-generated raw data files to identify Darters and quantify both conditioned and unconditioned responses. We find that like freezing, conditioned darting occurrences scale with experimental alterations. While most darting occurs in females, we find that with an extended training protocol, darting can emerge in males as well. Collectively, our data suggest that darting reflects a behavioral switch in conditioned responding that is a product of both an individual animals sex, shock reactivity, and experimental parameters, underscoring the need for careful consideration of sex as a biological variable in classic learning paradigms.",

    "abstract": "QuestionWe sought to define the mechanism underlying lung microvascular regeneration in a severe acute lung injury (ALI) model induced by selective lung endothelial cell ablation.\n\nMethodsChanges in lung cell populations and gene expression profiles were determined in transgenic mice expressing human diphtheria toxin (DT) receptor targeted to ECs using single-cell RNA sequencing at baseline (day 0) and days 3, 5 and 7 after lung EC ablation.\n\nResultsEight distinct endothelial clusters were resolved, including alveolar aerocytes (aCap) ECs expressing apelin at baseline, and general capillary (gCap) ECs expressing the apelin receptor. Intratracheal instillation of DT resulted in ablation of >70% of lung ECs, producing severe ALI with near complete resolution by 7 days. At 3 days post injury, a novel gCap population emerged characterized by de novo expression of apelin, together with the stem cell marker, protein C receptor. These stem-like cells transitioned to proliferative ECs, expressing apelin receptor together with the pro-proliferative transcription factor, FoxM1. This progenitor-like cell population was responsible for the rapid replenishment of all depleted EC populations by 7 days post injury, including aerocytes which play a critical role in re-establishment of the air-blood barrier. Treatment with an apelin receptor antagonist prevented recovery and resulted in excessive mortality, consistent with a central role for apelin signaling in EC regeneration and microvascular repair.\n\nConclusionThe lung has a remarkable capacity for microvasculature EC regeneration which is orchestrated by signaling between newly emergent apelin-expressing gCap endothelial stem-like cells and highly proliferative, apelin receptor positive endothelial progenitors.\n\nTake-Home messageUsing sublethal lung endothelial cell (EC) ablation, we show for the first that EC regeneration and resolution of acute lung injury is orchestrated by novel apelin-expressing, gCap endothelial stem-like cells by a mechanism requiring apelin signaling.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nA schematic representation of EC populations contributing to microvascular repair. At baseline (Day 0), there are two main alveolar groups of capillary ECs: larger apelin positive aCap ECs, termed aerocytes, that play a key structural role in forming the air-blood barrier; and smaller apelin receptor (Aplnr) expressing gCap ECs, which are found in the thicker regions at the corners of the alveoli. After DT-induced EC ablation, there is a marked depletion of both EC populations and the appearance of novel transitional and transient populations. At Day 3, there is the appearance of stem-like gCap ECs that paradoxically express apelin, but not its receptor, and are characterized by various stem and progenitor cell markers but show no evidence of proliferation. By Day 5, these transition to ECs expressing Aplnr which have a strong proliferative phenotype, as evidenced by FoxM1 and Ki67 expression, and then rapidly replenish depleted EC pools, including aCap ECs, by Day 7. This transition is orchestrated by the interaction of apelin with its receptor as a critical mechanism in lung microvascular regeneration after EC injury.

However, most PROTACs generated lack cell-type selectivity and have poorly soluble in water. To address this drawback, we developed a novel PROTAC ZL216 using aptamer AS1411 as a targeting ligand of nucleolin to conjugate with a small molecule ligand of E3 ligase VHL, which shows high aqueous solubility and serum stability. Based on the differential expression of nucleolin on the cell surface, ZL216 could bind to and internalize into breast cancer cells, but not normal breast cells. Furthermore, we revealed that ZL216 promoted the formation of a nucleolin-ZL216-VHL ternary complex in breast cancer cells and potently induced nucleolin degradation in vitro and in vivo. As a result, ZL216 inhibited the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. These studies demonstrate that in addition to peptides and small molecule compounds, nuclei acid aptamers can also be used to generate PROTACs, which broadens the toolbox constructing PROTACs and provides a promising strategy for development of tumor-selective PROTACs.",

    "abstract": "The specific activity of enzymes can be altered over long time scales in cells by synonymous mutations, which change an mRNA molecules sequence but not the encoded proteins primary structure. How this happens at the molecular level is unknown. Here, we investigate this issue by applying multiscale modeling to three E. coli enzymes - type III chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, D-alanine-D-alanine ligase B, and dihydrofolate reductase. This modeling involves coarse-grained simulations of protein synthesis and post-translational behavior, all-atom simulations as a test of robustness, and QM/MM calculations to characterize enzymatic function. We first demonstrate that our model predicts experimentally measured changes in specific activity due to synonymous mutations. Then, we show that changes in codon translation rates induced by synonymous mutations cause shifts in co-translational and post-translational folding pathways that kinetically partition molecules into subpopulations that very slowly interconvert to the native, functional state. These long-lived states exhibit reduced catalytic activity, as demonstrated by their increased activation energies for the reactions they carry out. Structurally, these states resemble the native state, with localized misfolding near the active sites of the enzymes. The localized misfolding involves noncovalent lasso entanglements - a topology in which the protein backbone forms a loop closed by noncovalent native contacts which is then threaded by another portion of the protein. Such entanglements are often kinetic traps, as they can require a large proportion of the protein to unfold, which is energetically unfavorable, before they can disentangle and attain the native state. The near-native structures of these misfolded states allow them to bypass the proteostasis machinery and remain soluble, as they exhibit similar hydrophobic surface areas as the native state. These entangled structures persist in all-atom simulations as well, indicating that these conclusions are independent of model resolution. Moreover, the structures of long-lived entangled states are supported by agreement with limited-proteolysis mass spectrometry results. Thus, synonymous mutations cause shifts in the co- and post-translational structural ensemble of proteins, whose altered subpopulations lead to long-term changes in the specific activities of some enzymes. The formation of entangled subpopulations is a plausible mechanism through which changes in translation elongation rate alter ensemble-averaged specific activities, which can ultimately affect the efficiency of biochemical pathways and phenotypic traits.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin, 5FU and docetaxel (TPF) are the most common chemotherapy regimen used for advanced OSCC. However, many cancer patients experience relapse, continued tumor growth, and spread due to drug resistance, which leads to treatment failure and metastatic disease. Here, using a CRISPR/Cas9 based kinome knockout screening, Misshapen-like kinase 1 (MINK1) is identified as an important mediator of 5FU resistance in OSCC. Analysis of clinical samples demonstrated significantly higher MINK1 expression in the tumor tissues of chemotherapy non-responder as compared to chemotherapy responders. The nude mice and zebrafish xenograft experiments indicate that knocking out MINK1 restores 5FU mediated cell death in chemoresistant OSCC. An antibody based phosphorylation array screen revealed MINK1 as a negative regulator of p53. Mechanistically, MINK1 modulates AKT phosphorylation at Ser473, which enables p-MDM2 (Ser 166) mediated degradation of p53. We also identified lestaurtinib as a potent inhibitor of MINK1 kinase activity. The patient derived TPF resistant cell based xenograft data suggest that lestaurtinib restores 5FU sensitivity and facilitates a significant reduction of tumor burden. Overall, our study suggests that MINK1 is a major driver of 5FU resistance in OSCC. The novel combination of MINK1 inhibitor lestaurtinib and 5FU needs further clinical investigation in advanced OSCC.",

The etiology of diastolic dysfunction includes alterations in fuel substrate metabolism that negatively impact cardiac bioenergetics, and may precipitate the eventual transition to heart failure. To date, the molecular mechanisms that regulate early changes in fuel metabolism leading to diastolic dysfunction remain unclear. In this report, we use a diet-induced obesity model and quantitative acetylproteomics in aged mice to show that inhibitory lysine acetylation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex promotes energetic deficits and diastolic dysfunction in mouse hearts. Cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of the mitochondrial lysine acetylation regulatory protein GCN5L1 prevented hyperacetylation of the PDH complex subunit PDHA1, allowing aged obese mice to continue using pyruvate as a bioenergetic substrate in the heart. Our findings suggest that changes in mitochondrial protein lysine acetylation represent a key metabolic component of diastolic dysfunction that precedes the development of heart failure.",

We demonstrate that contrast-sensitivity peaks in the afternoon accompanied by a four-fold increase in the average Shannon information transmitted from an active zone. This increase reflects higher synaptic gain, lower spontaneous \"noise\" and reduced variability of evoked responses. Simultaneously, an increase in the probability of multivesicular events with larger information content increases the efficiency of transmission (bits per vesicle) by factors of 1.5-2.7.

    "abstract": "Human activity and land management practices, in particular land use change, have resulted in the global loss of biodiversity. These types of disturbance affect the shape of macroecological patterns, and therefore analyzing these patterns can provide insights into how ecosystems are affected by land use change. We here use arthropod census data from 96 sites at Terceira Island in the Azores archipelago across four different land uses of increasing management intensity: native forest, exotic forest, semi-natural pasture, and intensive pasture, to examine the effects of land use type on three macroecological patterns: the species abundance distribution, the metabolic rate distribution of individuals, and the species-area relationship. The Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) has successfully predicted these patterns across habitats and taxa in undisturbed ecosystems, and thus provides a null expectation for their shapes. Across these patterns, we find that the forest habitats are the best fit by METE predictions, while the semi-natural pasture is consistently the worst fit, and the intensive pasture is intermediately well fit. We show that the direction of failure of the METE predictions at the pasture sites is likely due to the hyper-dominance of introduced spider species present there. We hypothesize that the particularly poor fit for the semi-natural pasture is due to the mix of arthropod communities out of equilibrium, leading to greater heterogeneity in composition and complex dynamics that violate METEs assumption of static state variables. The comparative better fit for the intensive pasture plausibly results from more homogeneous arthropod communities that are well adapted to intensive management, and thus whose state variables are less in flux. Analyzing deviations from theoretical predictions across land use type provides useful information about how land use and disturbance affect ecosystems, and such comparisons could be useful across other habitats and taxa.",

Here, we used single cell RNA-seq to study the dynamics of the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in activated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from 96 African American children. We employed novel statistical approaches to calculate a mean-independent measure of gene expression variability and a measure of transcriptional response pseudotime. Using these approaches, we demonstrated that glucocorticoids reverse the effects of immune stimulation on both gene expression mean and variability. Our novel measure of gene expression response dynamics, based on the diagonal linear discriminant analysis, separated individual cells by response status on the basis of their transcriptional profiles and allowed us to identify different dynamic patterns of gene expression along the response pseudotime. We identified genetic variants regulating gene expression mean and variability, including treatment-specific effects, and demonstrated widespread genetic regulation of the transcriptional dynamics of the gene expression response.",

    "abstract": "Gene drives have shown great promise for suppression of pest populations. These engineered alleles can function by a variety of mechanisms, but the most common is the CRISPR homing drive, which converts wild-type alleles to drive alleles in the germline of heterozygotes. Some potential target species are haplodiploid, in which males develop from unfertilized eggs and thus have only one copy of each chromosome. This prevents drive conversion, a substantial disadvantage compared to diploids where drive conversion can take place in both sexes. Here, we study homing suppression gene drives in haplodiploids and find that a drive targeting a female fertility gene could still be successful. However, such drives are less powerful than in diploids and suffer more from functional resistance alleles. They are substantially more vulnerable to high resistance allele formation in the embryo due to maternally deposited Cas9 and gRNA and also to somatic cleavage activity. Examining spatial models where organisms move over a continuous landscape, we find that haplodiploid suppression drives surprisingly perform nearly as well as in diploids, possibly due to their ability to spread further before inducing strong suppression. Together, these results indicate that gene drive can potentially be used to effectively suppress haplodiploid populations.",

Most recent models accredit this context invariance to an extraction of increasingly complex sensory features in hierarchical feedforward networks. Here, we study how context-invariant representations can be established by feedback rather than feedforward processing. We show that feedforward neural networks modulated by feedback can dynamically generate invariant sensory representations. The required feedback can be implemented as a slow and spatially diffuse gain modulation. The invariance is not present on the level of individual neurons, but emerges only on the population level. Mechanistically, the feedback modulation dynamically reorients the manifold of neural activity and thereby maintains an invariant neural subspace in spite of contextual variations. Our results highlight the importance of population-level analyses for understanding the role of feedback in flexible sensory processing.",

    "abstract": "The search for an  ideal approach to investigate the functional connections in the human brain is an ongoing challenge for the neuroscience community. While resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to study individual functional connectivity patterns, recent work has highlighted the benefits of collecting functional connectivity data while participants are exposed to naturalistic stimuli, such as watching a movie or listening to a story. For example, functional connectivity data collected during movie-watching were shown to predict cognitive and emotional scores more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We have previously reported a tight link between resting-state functional connectivity and task-derived neural activity, such that the former successfully predicts the latter. In the current work we use data from the Human Connectome Project to demonstrate that naturalistic-stimulus-derived functional connectivity predicts task-induced brain activation maps more accurately than resting-state-derived functional connectivity. We then show that activation maps predicted using naturalistic stimuli are better predictors of individual intelligence scores than activation maps predicted using resting-state. We additionally examine the influence of naturalistic-stimulus type on prediction accuracy. Our findings emphasize the potential of naturalistic stimuli as a promising alternative to resting-state fMRI for connectome-based predictive modelling of individual brain activity and cognitive traits.",

    "abstract": "The auditory system uses various signal properties to separate a target signal from background noise. When a target tone is preceded by a noise, the threshold for target detection can be increased or decreased depending on the type of a preceding masker. The effect of the preceding masker on the following sound can be interpreted as stream formation. The effect of stream formation is assumed to be either the result of adaptation at a low-level or high-level auditory processing. In an attempt to disentangle these, we investigated the time constant of the underlying process of adaptation by varying the length of the preceding masker. We designed stimuli consisting of the preceding masker and the following masked tone. Each stimulus induces various stream formation, affecting following target detection or masking release. Target tone was presented in comodulated masking noise and with interaural phase difference (IPD), inducing comodulation masking release (CMR) and binaural masking level difference (BMLD), respectively. We measured CMR and BMLD when the length of preceding maskers varied from 0 (no preceding masker) to 500 ms. We postulate that if the adaptation is dominated by high-level auditory processing, both CMR and BMLD will be affected by an increase in the length of the preceding masker. Results showed that CMR was more affected with longer preceding maskers from 100 ms to 500 ms compared to shorter maskers. On the contrary, the preceding masker did not affect the BMLD. Based on the results, we suggest that the adaptation to a preceding masking sound may arise from a low-level (e.g., cochlear nucleus, CN) rather than the temporal integration by the high-level auditory processing.",

Polarization of the light scattered by two types of kinesin-GNRs periodically oscillated as they orbited the microtubule along a left-handed helical trajectory. Our analyses revealed that each kinesin-GNR unidirectionally rotates about its yaw axis as it translocates, and that the period of this yaw-axis rotation corresponds to two periods of its left-handed helical orbit around the microtubule axis. Theoretical analyses suggest that the yaw-axis rotation enhances biased lateral displacement of the kinesin team. Our study reveals biaxial rotation as a new mode of motility in kinesin teams that may help the team to sidestep roadblocks.",

This results in a decrease in detection thresholds, quantified as comodulation masking release (CMR) and binaural masking level difference (BMLD), respectively. However, their relevance to speech perception is unclear as most studies have used artificial stimuli different from speech. Here, we investigated the ecological validity of masking release by using stimuli with speech-like spectro-temporal dynamics. We designed stimuli reflecting formant changes in speech. Each stimulus consists of three masker bands centered at formant frequencies F1, F2, and F3 based on CV combination: /gu/, /fu/, and /pu/. Maskers were either uncorrelated or comodulated to estimate CMR. In addition, target tone was centered at F2 trajectories and presented either with no IPD or IPD of {pi} to induce BMLD. We found that the CMR was small (< 3 dB) while BMLD was comparable to previous findings (~ 9 dB). To conclude, we suggest that features other than comodulation play a dominant role in grouping frequency components, such as the spectral proximity, the number of masker bands, and and formant trajectories.",

However, a systemic comparison across different methods is scarce. Using a carbon nanotube as a model of small conductance ion channel, we computed the single-channel permeability for potassium ion using umbrella sampling, Markovian milestoning, and steady-state flux under applied voltage. We show that a slightly modified inhomogeneous solubility-diffusion equation yields a single-channel permeability consistent with the mean first passage time (MFPT)-based method. For milestoning, applying cylindrical and spherical bulk boundary conditions yield consistent MFPT if factoring in the effective bulk concentration. The sensitivity of the MFPT to the output frequency of collective variables is highlighted using the convergence and symmetricity of the inward and outward MFPT profiles. The consistent transport kinetic results from all three methods demonstrated the robustness of MD-based methods in computing ion channel permeation. The advantages and disadvantages of each technique are discussed, focusing on the future applications of milestoning in more complex systems.",

Here, we developed IReNA (Integrated Regulatory Network Analysis) for network inference through integrated analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data, network modularization, transcription factor enrichment, and construction of simplified intermodular regulatory networks. Using public datasets, we showed that integrated network analysis of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data using IReNA outperformed currently available methods in identifying known regulators.

    "abstract": "Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), accounting for 14% of our genome, serve as a genetic reservoir from which new genes can emerge. Nematode ERVs are particularly diverse and informative of retrovirus evolution. We identify Atlas virus - a novel, intact ERV in the human hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum with an envelope protein genetically related to GN-GC glycoproteins from phleboviruses. A cryo-EM structure of Atlas GC reveals a class II viral membrane fusion protein fold not previously seen in retroviruses. Atlas GC has the structural hallmarks of an active fusogen. Atlas GC trimers insert into membranes with endosomal lipid compositions and low pH. When expressed on the plasma membrane, Atlas GC has cell-cell fusion activity. Atlas virus is transcriptionally active at specific stages of hookworm development. The preserved activities and expression pattern of Atlas GC suggest it has acquired a cellular function. Our work reveals an unexpected degree of structural and genetic plasticity in retroviruses.",

    "abstract": "In vivo calcium imaging is a standard neuroimaging technique that allows selective observation of target neuronal activities. In calcium imaging, neuron activation signals provide key information for the investigation of neural circuits. For efficient extraction of the calcium signals of neurons, selective detection of the region of interest (ROI) pixels corresponding to the active subcellular region of the target neuron is essential. However, current ROI detection methods for calcium imaging data exhibit a relatively low signal extraction performance from neurons with a low signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR). This is problematic because a low SNR is unavoidable in many biological experiments. Therefore, we propose an iterative correlation-based ROI detection (ICoRD) method that robustly extracts the calcium signal of the target neuron from a calcium imaging series with severe noise. ICoRD extracts calcium signals closer to the ground-truth calcium signal than the conventional method from simulated calcium imaging data in all low SNR ranges. Additionally, this study confirmed that ICoRD robustly extracts activation signals against noise, even within in vivo environments. ICoRD showed reliable detection from neurons with a low SNR and sparse activation, which were not detected by conventional methods. ICoRD will facilitate our understanding of neural circuit activity by providing significantly improved ROI detection in noisy images.",

    "abstract": "Heterozygous GRN (progranulin) mutations cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) due to haploinsufficiency, and increasing progranulin levels is a major therapeutic goal. Several microRNAs, including miR-29b, negatively regulate progranulin protein levels. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are emerging as a promising therapeutic modality for neurological diseases, but strategies for increasing target protein levels are limited. Here, we tested the efficacy of ASOs as enhancers of progranulin expression by sterically blocking the miR-29b binding site in the 3 UTR of the human GRN mRNA. We found 16 ASOs that increase progranulin protein in a dose-dependent manner in neuroglioma cells. A subset of these ASOs also increased progranulin protein in iPSC-derived neurons and in a humanized GRN mouse model. In FRET-based assays, the ASOs effectively competed miR-29b from binding to the GRN 3 UTR RNA. The ASOs increased levels of newly synthesized progranulin protein by increasing its translation, as revealed by ribosomal profiling. Together, our results demonstrate that ASOs can be used to effectively increase target protein levels by partially blocking miR binding sites. This ASO strategy may be therapeutically feasible for progranulin-deficient FTD as well as other conditions of haploinsufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Accumulation of Tau aggregates is a pathological hallmark of Alzheimers disease, but little is known about where these aggregates assemble and how stable these assemblies are. Using quantitative, single-molecule imaging, we show that Tau exhibits spatial and kinetic heterogeneity near the plasma membrane, resulting in the formation of nanometer-sized hot spots smaller than the diffraction limit. The hot spots lasted tens of seconds, much longer than the short dwell time (~40 ms) of Tau on microtubules. Pharmacological and biochemical disruption of Tau/microtubule interactions did not affect hot spot formation, suggesting that these are different from the reported Tau condensation on microtubules. Although cholesterol removal has been shown to reduce Tau pathology, its depletion did not affect Tau hot spot dynamics. Our study identifies an intrinsic dynamic property of Tau near the plasma membrane that may facilitate the formation of assembly sites for Tau to assume its physiological and pathological functions.",

This motif is shared by other cerebellum-like structures, including the insect mushroom body, electrosensory lobe of electric fish, and mammalian dorsal cochlear nucleus, and has inspired numerous theoretical models of its functional role. Less attention has been paid to structures immediately presynaptic to granule cell layers, whose architecture can be described as a \"bottleneck\" and whose functional role is not understood. We therefore develop a general theory of cerebellum-like structures in conjunction with their afferent pathways. This theory predicts the role of the pontine relay to cerebellar cortex and the glomerular organization of the insect antennal lobe. It also reconciles theories of nonlinear mixing with recent observations of correlated granule cell activity. More generally, it shows that structured compression followed by random expansion is an efficient architecture for flexible computation.",

    "abstract": "American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was once the most economically and ecologically important hardwood species in the United States. In the first half of the 20th century, an exotic fungal pathogen - Cryphonectria parasitica - decimated the species, killing approximately four billion trees. Two approaches to developing blight resistant American chestnut populations show promise, but both will require introduction of adaptive genomic diversity from wild germplasm to produce diverse, locally adapted reforestation populations. Here we characterize population structure, demographic history, and genomic diversity in a range-wide sample of 384 wild American chestnuts to inform conservation and breeding with blight resistant varieties. Population structure analyses with DAPC and ADMIXTURE suggest that the chestnut range can be roughly divided into northeast, central, and southwest populations. Within-population genomic diversity estimates revealed a clinal pattern with the highest diversity in the southwest, which likely reflects bottleneck events associated with Quaternary glaciation. Finally, we identified genomic regions under positive selection within each population, which suggests that defense against fungal pathogens is a common target of selection across all populations. Taken together, these results show that American chestnut underwent a postglacial expansion from the southern portion of its range leading to three extant populations. These populations will serve as management units for breeding adaptive genetic variation into the blight-resistant tree populations for targeted reintroduction efforts.",

Here we report PylRS enzymes that accept -hydroxy acids, -thio acids, N-formyl-L--amino acids, and -carboxyl acid monomers (malonic acids) that are formally precursors to polyketide natural products. These monomers are all accommodated and accepted by the translation apparatus in vitro. High-resolution structural analysis of the complex between one such PylRS enzyme and a meta-substituted 2-benzylmalonate derivative reveals an active site that discriminates pro-chiral carboxylates and accommodates the large size and distinct electrostatics of an -carboxyl acid substituent. This work emphasizes the potential of PylRS-derived enzymes for acylating tRNA with monomers whose -substituent diverges significantly from the -amine embodied in proteinogenic amino acids. These enzymes could act in synergy with natural or evolved ribosomes to generate diverse sequence-defined non-protein hetero-oligomers.",

    "abstract": "In normal activated B-cells, Activation Induced-cytidine deaminase (AID) is absolutely required for immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination (CSR) and IGHV somatic hypermutation (SHM). AID is also implicated in the Locus Suicide Recombination (LSR) of the Ig heavy (IgH) locus, resulting in the deletion of the IgH constant part. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an indolent non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma characterized by tumor CLL B-cells that weakly express a B cell receptor (BCR) on their surface. The great majority of CLL tumor B-cells are non class-switched. Searching for abnormalities of IgH locus recombination in CLL, we investigated CSR and LSR in samples from CLL patients (N=47) with high blood tumor cell infiltration (>98%) and in healthy volunteers (HV) as controls (N=9). LSR was detectable at comparable levels in both HV and CLL groups. CSR counts were decreased in CLL samples as expected. As distribution of LSR counts was bimodal, we separated CLL patients in two groups so called LSRHigh and LSRLow. LSRHigh CLLs exhibited very weak AID expression and low mutation rate of IgHV region and of the AID off-target PIM1 gene. LSR junction diversity, evaluated using the Shannon index, was increased in LSRHigh CLLs suggesting that LSR was on-going in these cells. Also, shorter telomeres were observed in LSRHigh CLLs suggesting an increased number of past mitosis. Consistently, increased levels of cMYC expression were detected in LSRHigh CLLs and treatment free survival of these cases was markedly decreased. We hypothesized that LSR in LSRHigh CLLs is AID independent and could be due to DNA lesion and inaccurate DSB repair within the IgH locus, which could be accessible to recombination machinery due to increased IgH locus transcription. Altogether, our results indicate the accessibility of IgH locus and the proliferation increase LSR rate in LSRHigh CLLs could be related to cMYC resulting in shorter treatment free survival of patients and point on an AID independent mechanism of IgH recombination.",

Limited research has been conducted on the functional neuronal circuitry of tear production. In particular, the neuronal mechanisms of emotional tearing, which is a physiological reaction harmonized with enhanced emotional arousal and assumed to be unique to humans, remain unclear. We identified that the oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus is functionally projected to the oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the lacrimation center of the superior salivatory nucleus. Optogenetic activation or inhibition of these neurons and/or receptors can modulate the superior salivatory nucleus dependent tear secretion mediated through oxytocin. Moreover, we identified that maternal behavior, nociceptive behavior stimulation, and aversive memory retrieval are linked to tearing in mice, and that these emotional linked tearing are suppressed by optogenetic inhibition of the corresponding oxytocin system. Thus, tearing could be regulated through functional connections between central oxytocin systems in the paraventricular hypothalamus and the superior salivatory nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic variation is the basis for trait adaptation via evolutionary selection.1, 2, 3 However, the driving forces behind the quantitative trait variations remain unclear owing to their complexity at the molecular level.4, 5, 6 This study focused on the natural variation of the free-running period (FRP) of the circadian clock because FRP is a determining factor of the internal clock phase (chronotype), which is responsible for physiological timing during a day.7 Although natural variations in FRP have been widely reported,8, 10, 11 few studies have shown the association between FRP and adaptive temporal traits. As a clock-dependent physiological process, photoperiodism is a typical target of local adaptation.12, 13 Lemna aequinoctialis in Japan is a paddy-field duckweed exhibiting a latitudinal cline of critical day-lengths (CDLs) for short-day flowering.14 To investigate the relationship between FRP and CDL, we collected 72 strains of L. aequinoctialis within a latitudinal range between 31.5{degrees}N to 43.8{degrees}N. We found a significant correlation (P = 7.5E-8) between FRPs and locally adaptive CDLs, confirming that the variation in FRP-dependent chronotypes underlies geographically differentiated photoperiodism. Diel transcriptome analysis revealed that the induction timing of a florigen gene is key for connecting chronotypes to photoperiodism at the molecular level. Based on these results, we propose a fundamental rule concerning the \"chronotype effect\" in evolution: the variation of FRP functions as a resource for the variation of temporal traits. This study highlights the adaptive significance of FRP variation and provides a reason for the maintenance of FRP variation in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling is frequently dysregulated in various cancers. The ubiquitin ligase Cbl (Casitas B-lineage lymphoma proto-oncogene) regulates degradation of activated EGFR through ubiquitination and acts as an adaptor to recruit proteins required for trafficking. We used Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC) mass spectrometry (MS) to compare Cbl complexes with or without epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation. We identified over a hundred novel Cbl interactors, and a secondary siRNA screen found that knockdown of Flotillin-2 (FLOT2) led to increased phosphorylation and degradation of EGFR upon EGF stimulation in HeLa cells. In PC9 and H441 cells, FLOT2 knockdown increased EGF-stimulated EGFR phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and downstream signaling, reversible by the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib. CRISPR knockout (KO) of FLOT2 in HeLa cells confirmed EGFR downregulation, increased signaling, and increased dimerization and trafficking to the early endosome. FLOT2 interacted with both Cbl and EGFR. EGFR downregulation upon FLOT2 loss was Cbl-dependent, as co-knockdown of Cbl and Cbl-b restored EGFR levels. Overexpression of FLOT2 decreased EGFR sjgnaling and growth. Overexpression of wild type (WT) FLOT2, but not the soluble G2A FLOT2 mutant, inhibited EGFR phosphorylation upon EGF stimulation in HEK293T cells. FLOT2 loss induced EGFR-dependent proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Lastly, FLOT2 KO increased tumor formation and tumor volume in nude mice and NSG mice, respectively. These data demonstrated that FLOT2 negatively regulated EGFR activation and dimerization, as well as its subsequent ubiquitination, endosomal trafficking, and degradation, leading to reduced proliferation in vitro and in vivo.",

MINORg aims to lessen this workload by capitalising on sequence homology to favour multi-target gRNA while simultaneously screening multiple genetic backgrounds in order to generate reusable gRNA panels. We demonstrated the practical application of MINORg by knocking out a 11 homologous genes tandemly arrayed in a multigene cluster in two Arabidopsis thaliana lineages using three gRNA output by MINORg.

Here we present a human Brain-Chip engineered to recapitulate critical aspects of the complex brain cell-cell interactions that mediate neuroinflammation development. Our human organotypic microphysiological system (MPS) includes endothelial-like cells, pericytes, glia, and cortical neurons and maintains BBB permeability at in vivo relevant levels, providing a significant improvement in complexity and clinical mimicry compared to previous MPS models. This is the first report of a Brain-Chip with an RNA expression profile close to that of the adult human cortex and that demonstrates advantages over Transwell culture. Through perfusion of TNF-, we recreated key inflammatory features, such as glia activation, the release of proinflammatory cytokines, and increased barrier permeability. Our model may provide a reliable tool for mechanistic studies in neuron-glial interactions and dysregulation of BBB function during neuroinflammation.",

    "abstract": "Parchment was used as a writing material in the Middle Ages and was made using animal skins by liming them with Ca(OH)2. During liming, collagen peptides containing Glutamine (Q) undergo deamidation resulting in a mass shift of 0.984 Da. Assessing the extent of deamidation can inform us about parchment production patterns and quality. In this study, we propose a simple three-step workflow, developed as an R package called MALDIpqi(), to estimate deamidation in parchment derived collagen using low-resolution MALDI-TOF spectra. After pre-processing raw spectra, we used weighted least-squares linear regression to estimate Q deamidation levels from the convoluted isotopic envelope for seven collagen-peptide markers. Finally, we employed a linear mixed effect model to predict the overall deamidation level of a parchment sample termed Parchment Glutamine Index (PQI). To test the robustness of the workflow, we applied MALDIpqi() to previously published ZooMS data generated from almost an entire library of the Cistercian monastery at Orval Abbey, Belgium. In addition to reliably predicting PQI, we observed interesting patterns pertaining to parchment production. MALDIpqi() holds excellent potential for biocodicological and other archaeological studies involving collagen, such as bone, but we also foresee its application in the food and biomedical industry.",

While subthreshold excitatory inputs integrate linearly in wild-type animals, surprisingly those with FXS summate sublinearly, contradicting what would be expected of a hyperexcitable cortex typically associated with ASD. Knockdown of the regulatory {beta}4 subunit of BK channels, rescues the synaptic integration, a result that was corroborated with numerical simulations. Taken together, these findings suggest that there is a differential impairment in the integration of feedforward sensory and feedback predictive inputs in L5 pyramidal neurons in FXS and potentially other forms of ASD. These results challenge the traditional view that FXS and other ASD are characterized by sensory hypersensitivity, but instead by hyposensitivity of sensory inputs and hypersensitivity of predictive inputs onto cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "The Iron Age was a dynamic period in central Mediterranean history, with the expansion of Greek and Phoenician colonies and the growth of Carthage into the dominant maritime power of the Mediterranean. These events were facilitated by the ease of long-distance travel following major advances in seafaring. We know from the archaeological record that trade goods and materials were moving across great distances in unprecedented quantities, but it is unclear how these patterns correlate with human mobility. To investigate population mobility and interactions directly, we sequenced the genomes of 30 ancient individuals from coastal cities around the central Mediterranean, in Tunisia, Sardinia, and central Italy. We observe a meaningful contribution of autochthonous populations, as well as highly heterogeneous ancestry including many individuals with non-local ancestries from other parts of the Mediterranean region. These results highlight both the role of local populations and the extreme interconnectedness of populations in the Iron Age Mediterranean. By studying these trans-Mediterranean neighbors together, we explore the complex interplay between local continuity and mobility that shaped the Iron Age societies of the central Mediterranean.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe recent growth of single-cell transcriptomics has turned single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) into a near-routine experiment. Breakthroughs in improving scalability have led to the creation of organism-wide transcriptomic datasets, aiming to comprehensively profile the cell types and states within an organism throughout its lifecycle. To date however, the skeleton remains a majorly underrepresented organ system in organism-wide atlases. Considering how the skeleton not only serves as the central framework of the vertebrate body but is also the home of the hematopoietic niche and a central player in major metabolic and homeostatic processes, this presents a major deficit in current reference atlas projects. To address this issue, we integrated seven separate scRNA-seq datasets containing skeletal cells and their developmental precursors, generating an atlas of over 800,000 cells. This skeletal cell atlas describes cells across the mesenchymal lineage from the induction of the limb field to adult bone, encompassing 50 different cell states. In addition, the original datasets were reannotated, enabling the discovery of novel, highly specific marker genes, some of which we have validated in vivo by whole-mount in situ hybridization. Furthermore, expanding the repertoire of available time points and cell types within a single dataset allowed for more complete analyses of cell-cell communication or in silico perturbation studies. Taken together, we present a missing piece in the current atlas mapping efforts, which will be of value to researchers in the fields of skeletal biology, hematopoiesis, metabolism and regenerative medicine.",

    "abstract": "The human auditory system extracts rich linguistic abstractions from the speech signal. Traditional approaches to understand this complex process have used classical linear feature encoding models, with limited success. Artificial neural networks have recently achieved remarkable speech recognition performance and offer potential alternative computational models of speech processing. We used the speech representations learned by state-of-the-art deep neural network (DNN) models to investigate neural coding across the ascending auditory pathway from the peripheral auditory nerve to auditory speech cortex. We found that representations in hierarchical layers of the DNN correlated well to neural activity throughout the ascending auditory system. Unsupervised speech models achieve the optimal neural correlations among all models evaluated. Deeper DNN layers with context-dependent computations were essential for populations of high order auditory cortex encoding, and the computations were aligned to phonemic and syllabic context structures in speech. Accordingly, DNN models trained on a specific language (English or Mandarin) predicted cortical responses in native speakers of each language. These results reveal convergence between representations learned in DNN models and the biological auditory pathway and provide new approaches to modeling neural coding in the auditory cortex.",

    "abstract": "When sensory input conveys rhythmic regularity, we can form predictions about the timing of upcoming events. Although rhythm processing capacities differ considerably between individuals, these differences are often obscured by participant- and trial-level data averaging procedures in M/EEG research. Here, we systematically assessed the neurophysiological variability displayed by individuals listening to isochronous equitone sequences interspersed with unexpected deviant tones. We first focused on rhythm tracking and tested the anticipatory phase alignment of delta-band activity to expected tone onsets. These analyses confirmed that individuals encode temporal regularities and form temporal predictions, but highlight clear inter- and intra-participant variability. This observation may indicate individual and flexible tracking mechanisms, which show consistency at the single-trial level, but variability over trials. We then modelled single-trial time-locked neural responses in the beta-band to investigate individual tendencies to spontaneously employ binary grouping (\"tic-toc effect\"). This approach identified binary (strong-weak), ternary (strong-weak-weak), and mixed accentuation patterns, confirming the superimposition of a basic beat pattern. Furthermore, we characterized individual grouping preferences and tendencies to use binary, ternary, or combined patterns over trials. Importantly, the processing of standard and deviant tones was modulated by the employed pattern. The current approach supports individualized neurophysiological profiling as a sensitive strategy to identify dynamically evolving neural signatures of rhythm and beat processing. We further suggest that close examination of neurophysiological variability is critical to improve our understanding of the individual and flexible mechanisms underlying the capacities to rapidly evaluate and adapt to environmental rhythms.\n\nSignificance statementFor decades, music, speech and rhythm research investigated how humans process, predict, and adapt to environmental rhythms. By adopting a single-trial and -participant approach, we avert the common pooling of EEG data in favor of individual time-varying neural signatures of rhythm tracking and beat processing. The results highlight large inter- and intra-individual differences in rhythm tracking, arguing against the typically documented phase-specificity for entrainment. On top of that, we characterize individual variability in beat processing, by showing that binary, ternary and other accentuation patterns are used over time, and ultimately affect the processing of (un-)expected auditory events. The approach aids individual neural profiling and may therefore allow identifying altered neural activity and its consequences in natural listening contexts.",

Germline and somatic analyses of multi-temporal and multi-regional molecular profiles indicated that ovarian and thyroid tumors did not share common genetic alterations. PTC tumors had driver events associated with aggressive PTC behavior, an RBPMS-NTRK3 fusion and a TERT promoter mutation. Spatial and temporal genomic heterogeneity analysis indicated a close link between anatomical locations and molecular patterns of PTC. Mutational signature analyses demonstrated a molecular footprint of platinum exposure, and that aggressive molecular drivers of PTC were linked to prior platinum-associated mutagenesis.

    "abstract": "Previous research has shown that resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between different brain regions (seeds) is related to motor learning and motor memory consolidation. Using high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) we addressed this question from a brain network perspective. Specifically, we examined frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting-state networks from twenty-nine young healthy participants before and after they were trained on a motor sequence learning task. Consolidation was assessed with an overnight retest on the motor task. We showed training-related decreases in gamma band connectivity within the motor network, and between the motor and functionally distinct resting-state networks including the attentional network. Brain-behavior correlation analyses revealed that baseline beta, delta and theta rsFC was related to subsequent motor learning and memory consolidation such that lower connectivity within the motor network and between the motor and several distinct resting-state networks was correlated with better learning and overnight consolidation. Last, training-related increases in beta-band connectivity between the motor and the visual networks were related to greater consolidation. Altogether our results indicate that connectivity in large-scale resting-state brain networks is related to - and modulated by - motor learning and memory consolidation processes. These finding corroborate previous seed-based connectivity research and provide evidence that frequency-dependent functional connectivity in resting state networks is critically linked to motor learning and memory consolidation.",

This endothelial dysfunction is associated with the phlogistic phenomenon of cytokine storms, thrombotic complications, abnormal coagulation, hypoxemia, and multiple organ failure. The mechanisms surrounding COVID-19 associated endotheliitis have been widely attributed to ACE2-mediated pathways. However, integrins have emerged as possible receptor candidates for SARS-CoV-2, and their complex intracellular signalling events are essential for maintaining endothelial homeostasis. Here, we showed that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 depends on its RGD motif to drive barrier dysregulation through hijacking integrin V{beta}3. This triggers the redistribution and internalization of major junction protein VE-Cadherin which leads to the barrier disruption phenotype. Both extracellular and intracellular inhibitors of integrin V{beta}3 prevented these effects, similarly to the RGD-cyclic peptide compound Cilengitide, which suggests that the spike protein - through its RGD motif - binds to V{beta}3 and elicits vascular leakage events. These findings support integrins as an additional receptor for SARS-CoV-2, particularly as integrin engagement can elucidate many of the adverse endothelial dysfunction events that stem from COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has caused more than 424 million infections and 5.9 million deaths so far. The vaccines used against SARS-COV-2 by now have been able to develop some neutralising antibodies in the vaccinated human population and slow down the infection rate. The effectiveness of the vaccines has been challenged by the emergence of the new strains with numerous mutations in the spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. Since S protein is the major immunogenic protein of the virus and also contains Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) that interacts with the human Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, any mutations in this region should affect the neutralisation potential of the antibodies leading to the immune evasion. Several variants of concern (VOC) of the virus have emerged so far. Among them, the most critical are Delta (B.1.617.2), and recently reported Omicron (B. 1.1.529) which have acquired a lot of mutations in the spike protein. We have mapped those mutations on the modelled RBD and evaluated the binding affinities of various human antibodies with it. Docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies have been used to explore the effect of the mutations on the structure of the RBD and the RBD-antibody interaction. The analysis shows that the mutations mostly at the interface of a nearby region lower the binding affinity of the antibody by ten to forty per cent, with a downfall in the number of interactions formed as a whole and therefore, it implies the generation of immune escape variants. Notable mutations and their effect was characterised by performing various analyses that explain the structural basis of antibody efficacy in Delta and a compromised neutralisation effect for the Omicron variant. Our results pave the way for robust vaccine design that can be effective for many variants.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nSynopsisThe research study utilises comparative docking and MD simulations analyses to illustrate how mutations in delta and omicron variants affect the binding of antibodies to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The loss of smell related to SARS-CoV-2 infection is one of the most prevalent symptoms of COVID-19. It is now clear that this symptom is related to the massive infection by SARS-CoV-2 of the olfactory epithelium leading to its desquamation. However, the molecular mechanism behind the destabilization of the olfactory epithelium is less clear. Using golden Syrian hamster, we show here that while apoptosis remains at a low level in damaged infected epithelium, the latter is invaded by innate immunity cells. By depleting the neutrophil population or blocking the activity of neutrophil elastase-like proteinases, we reduced the damage induced by the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Surprisingly, the impairment of neutrophil activity led to a decrease of SARS-CoV-2 infection levels in the nasal cavity. Our results indicate a counterproductive role of neutrophils leading to the release of infected cells in the lumen of the nasal cavity and thereby enhanced spreading of the virus.",

Omicron BA.1 infected animals showed reduced clinical signs, pathological changes, and viral shedding, compared to Delta-infected animals, but still showed gross- and histopathological evidence of pneumonia.

Odor-guided locomotion, an ecologically important behavior essential to an animals survival, is an example of such a behavior. Different odors activate different patterns of olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) classes providing information about which odor is present but does not provide any navigational information. In this study, we investigate the sensorimotor transformation that relates ORN activation to locomotion changes in Drosophila by optogenetically activating different combinations of ORN classes and measuring the resulting changes in locomotion. Three features describe this sensorimotor transformation: First, locomotion depends on both the instantaneous firing frequency (f) and its change (df); the two together serve as short-term memory that allows the fly to automatically adapt its motor program to sensory context. Second, the mapping between f-df and locomotor parameters such as speed or curvature is distinct for each pattern of activated ORNs. Finally, the sensorimotor mapping changes with time after odor exposure allowing integration of information over a longer timescale.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease and related dementias (ADRD) are marked by intracellular tau aggregates in the medial-temporal lobe (MTL) and extracellular amyloid aggregates in the default network (DN). Here, we sought to clarify ADRD-related co-dependencies between the MTLs most vulnerable structure, the hippocampus (HC), and the highly associative DN at a subregion resolution. We confronted the effects of APOE {varepsilon}2 and {varepsilon}4, rarely investigated together, with their impact on HC-DN co-variation regimes at the population level. In a two-pronged decomposition of structural brain scans from [~]40,000 UK Biobank participants, we located co-deviating structural patterns in HC and DN subregions as a function of ADRD family risk. Across the disclosed HC-DN signatures, recurrent deviations in the CA1, CA2/3, molecular layer, fornixs fimbria, and their cortical partners related to ADRD risk. Phenome-wide profiling of HC-DN co- variation expressions from these population signatures revealed male-specific associations with air-pollution, and female-specific associations with cardiovascular traits. We highlighted three main factors associated with brain-APOE associations across the different gene variants: happiness, and satisfaction with friendships, and with family. We further showed that APOE {varepsilon}2/2 interacts preferentially with HC-DN co-variation patterns in estimating social lifestyle in males and physical activity in females. Our findings reinvigorate the often-neglected interplay between APOE {varepsilon}2 dosage and sex, which we have linked to fine-grained structural divergences indicative of ADRD susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Episodic memories are encoded by sparse populations of neurons activated during an experience.1 These neural ensembles constitute memory engrams that are both necessary and sufficient for inducing recall even long after memory acquisition.2 This suggests that following encoding, engrams are stabilized to reliably support memory retrieval. However, little is known about the temporal evolution of engrams over the course of memory consolidation or how it impacts mnemonic properties. Here we employed computational and experimental approaches to examine how the composition and selectivity of engrams change with memory consolidation. We modeled engram cells using a spiking recurrent neural network that yielded three testable predictions: memories transition from unselective to selective as neurons are removed from and added to the engram, inhibitory activity during recall is essential for memory selectivity, and inhibitory synaptic plasticity during memory consolidation is critical for engrams to become selective. Using the Cal-Light system to tag activated neurons in vivo with high spatiotemporal precision3 as well as optogenetic and chemogenetic techniques, we conducted contextual fear conditioning experiments that supported each of our models predictions. Our results reveal that engrams are dynamic even within hours of memory consolidation and that changes in engram composition mediated by inhibitory synaptic plasticity are crucial for the emergence of memory selectivity. These findings challenge classical theories of stable memory traces and point to a close link between engram state and memory expression.",

To predict and explain these rapid transformations, computational neuroscientists employ machine learning modeling techniques. However, state-of-the-art models require massive amounts of data to properly train, and to the present day there is a lack of vast brain datasets which extensively sample the temporal dynamics of visual object recognition. Here we collected a large and rich dataset of high temporal resolution EEG responses to images of objects on a natural background. This dataset includes 10 participants, each with 82,160 trials spanning 16,740 image conditions. Through computational modeling we established the quality of this dataset in five ways. First, we trained linearizing encoding models that successfully synthesized the EEG responses to arbitrary images. Second, we correctly identified the recorded EEG data image conditions in a zero-shot fashion, using EEG synthesized responses to hundreds of thousands of candidate image conditions. Third, we show that both the high number of conditions as well as the trial repetitions of the EEG dataset contribute to the trained models prediction accuracy. Fourth, we built encoding models whose predictions well generalize to novel participants. Fifth, we demonstrate full end-to-end training of randomly initialized DNNs that output M/EEG responses for arbitrary input images. We release this dataset as a tool to foster research in visual neuroscience and computer vision.",

    "abstract": "A challenge in both modern and historic neuroscience has been achieving an understanding of neuron circuits, and determining the computational and organizational principles that underlie these circuits. Deeper understanding of the organization of brain circuits and cell types, including in the hippocampus, is required for advances in behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, as well as for understanding principles governing brain development and evolution. In this manuscript, we pioneer a new method to analyze the spatial clustering of active neurons in the hippocampus. We use calcium imaging and a rewarded navigation task to record from 100s of place cells in the CA1 of freely moving rats. We then use statistical techniques developed for and in widespread use in geographic mapping studies, global Morans I and local Morans I to demonstrate that cells that code for similar spatial locations tend to form small spatial clusters. We present evidence that this clustering is not the result of artifacts from calcium imaging, and show that these clusters are primarily formed by cells that have place field around previously rewarded locations. We go on to show that, although cells with similar place fields tend to form clusters, there is no obvious topographic mapping of environmental location onto the hippocampus, such as seen in the visual cortex. Insights into hippocampal organization, as in this study, can elucidate mechanisms underlying motivational behaviors, spatial navigation, and memory formation.",

Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) has been shown to confer heterologous immune protection against viral infections including COVID-19 and has been proposed as vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 (SCV2). Here we tested intravenous BCG vaccination against COVID-19 using the golden Syrian hamster model together with immune profiling and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). We observed that BCG reduced both lung SCV2 viral load and bronchopneumonia. This was accompanied by an increase in lung alveolar macrophages, a reversal of SCV2-mediated T cell lymphopenia, and reduced lung granulocytes. Single cell transcriptome profiling showed that BCG uniquely recruits immunoglobulin-producing plasma cells to the lung suggesting accelerated antibody production. BCG vaccination also recruited elevated levels of Th1, Th17, Treg, CTLs, and Tmem cells, and differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis showed a transcriptional shift away from exhaustion markers and towards antigen presentation and repair. Similarly, BCG enhanced lung recruitment of alveolar macrophages and reduced key interstitial macrophage subsets, with both cell-types also showing reduced IFN-associated gene expression. Our observations indicate that BCG vaccination protects against SCV2 immunopathology by promoting early lung immunoglobulin production and immunotolerizing transcriptional patterns among key myeloid and lymphoid populations.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus gallolyticus subspecies gallolyticus (Sgg) is known to be strongly associated with colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent functional studies further demonstrated that Sgg actively stimulates CRC cell proliferation and promotes the development of colon tumors. However, the Sgg factors important for the pro-proliferative and pro-tumor activities of Sgg remain unclear. Here, we identified a chromosomal locus in Sgg strain TX20005. Deletion of this locus significantly reduced Sgg adherence to CRC cells and abrogated the ability of Sgg to stimulate CRC cell proliferation. Thus, we designate this locus as the Sgg pathogenicity-associated region (SPAR). More importantly, we found that SPAR is important for Sgg pathogenicity in vivo. In a gut colonization model, mice exposed to the SPAR deletion mutant showed significantly reduced Sgg load in the colonic tissues and fecal materials, suggesting that SPAR contributes to the colonization capacity of Sgg. In a mouse model of CRC, deletion of SPAR abolished the ability of Sgg to promote the development of colon tumors growth. Taken together, these results highlight SPAR as a critical pathogenicity determinant of Sgg.",

    "abstract": "Melanins are ubiquitous black or brown color pigments exhibiting a wide variety of bioactivities. They are stable and insoluble in nature. Melanin are industrially important pigment currently used in cosmetics, medicine and pharmaceuticals, industries. Bacteria mainly produce three types of melanin namely, Eumelanin, pheomelanin and pyomelanin which is usually extracellularly secreted. This makes the downstream processing of bacterial melanin easier. Stress conditions like salt stress, radiation stress etc. triggers the bacteria to produce melanin and several bacterial species were found to produce melanin under different stress induced conditions. In this present study we had isolated melanin producing bacteria from saline sediment sample of Mundra port, Kutch region of Gujarat state of India. The melanin producing bacteria was characterized using staining, biochemical and molecular methods. The melanin produced was extracted and analyzed using physicochemical techniques. The extracted melanin had shown good anti-bacterial and radical scavenging activity. To our knowledge, this is the first report on Bacillus altitudinis producing melanin.",

    "abstract": "Viruses are microscopic pathogens capable of causing disease and are responsible for a range of human mortality and morbidity worldwide. They can be rendered harmless or destroyed with a range of antiviral chemical compounds. Cucurbit[n]urils (CB[n]s) are a macrocycle chemical compound existing as a range of homologues; due to their structure they can bind to biological materials, acting as supramolecular \"hosts\" to \"guests\", such as amino acids. Due to the increasing need for a non-toxic antiviral compound, we investigated whether cucurbit[n]urils could act in an antiviral manner. We have found that certain cucurbit[n]uril homologues do indeed have an antiviral effect against a range of viruses, including RSV and SARS-CoV-2. In particular, we demonstrate that CB[7] is the active homologue of CB[n] mixtures, having an antiviral effect against enveloped and non-enveloped species. High levels of efficacy were observed with five-minute contact times across different viruses. We also demonstrate that CB[7] acts with an extracellular virucidal mode of action via host-guest supramolecular interactions between viral surface proteins and the CB[n] cavity, rather than via cell internalisation or a virustatic mechanism. This finding demonstrates that CB[7] acts as a supramolecular virucidal antiviral (a mechanism distinct from other current extracellular antivirals) demonstrating the potential of supramolecular interactions for future antiviral disinfectants.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis has severe impacts in both humans and animals. Understanding the genetic basis of survival of both Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the human adapted species, and Mycobacterium bovis, the animal adapted species is crucial to deciphering the biology of both pathogens. There are several studies that identify the genes required for survival of M. tuberculosis in vivo using mouse models, however, there are currently no studies probing the genetic basis of survival of M. bovis in vivo. In this study we utilise transposon insertion sequencing in M. bovis to determine the genes required for survival in cattle. We identify genes encoding established mycobacterial virulence functions such as the ESX-1 secretion system, PDIM synthesis, mycobactin synthesis and cholesterol catabolism that are required in vivo. We show that, as in M. tuberculosis, phoPR is required by M. bovis in vivo despite the known defect in signalling through this system. Comparison to studies performed in glycerol adapted species such as M. bovis BCG and M. tuberculosis suggests that there are differences in the requirement for genes involved in cholesterol import (mce4 operon), oxidation (hsd) and detoxification (cyp125). We report good correlation with existing mycobacterial virulence functions, but also find several novel virulence factors, including genes involved in protein mannosylation, aspartate metabolism and glycerol-phosphate metabolism. These findings further extend our knowledge of the genetic basis of survival in vivo in bacteria that cause tuberculosis and provide insight for the development of novel diagnostics and therapeutics.\n\nImportanceThis is the first report of the genetic requirements of an animal adapted member of the MTBC in a natural host. M. bovis has devastating impacts in cattle and bovine tuberculosis is a considerable economic, animal welfare and public health concern. The data highlight the importance of mycobacterial cholesterol catabolism and identifies several new virulence factors. Additionally, the work informs the development of novel differential diagnostics and therapeutics for TB in both human and animal populations.",

    "abstract": "Akkermansia muciniphila is considered a key constituent of a healthy gut microbiota. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), A. muciniphila has a reduced abundance while other, putative pathogenic, mucus colonizers bloom. We hypothesized that interbacterial competition may contribute to this observation. By screening the supernatants of a panel of enteric bacteria, we discovered that a previously uncharacterized Allobaculum species potently inhibits the growth of A. muciniphila. Mass spectrometry analysis identified a secreted Allobaculum sialidase as inhibitor of A. muciniphila growth. The sialidase targets sialic acids on casein O-glycans, thereby altering the accessibility of nutrients critical for A. muciniphila. The altered glycometabolic niche results in distorted A. muciniphila cell division and efficiently arrests its growth. The identification of a novel mechanism of A. muciniphila growth inhibition by a competing bacterial pathobiont may provide a rationale for interventions aimed at restoring and maintaining a healthy microbiota symbiosis in patients with intestinal disease.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant plasmid vectors are versatile tools which have facilitated discoveries in molecular biology, genetics, proteomics, and many other fields. As the enzymatic and bacterial processes used to create recombinant DNA can introduce errors, sequence validation is an essential step in plasmid assembly. Sanger sequencing is the current standard for plasmid validation, however this method is limited by an inability to sequence through complex secondary structure and lacks scalability when applied to full-plasmid sequencing of multiple plasmids due to read-length limits. While next-generation sequencing (NGS) does provide full-plasmid sequencing at scale, it is impractical and costly when utilized outside of library-scale validation. Here we present OnRamp (Oxford nanopore-based Rapid Analysis of Multiplexed Plasmids), an alternative method for routine plasmid validation which combines the advantages of NGSs full plasmid coverage and scalability with Sangers affordability and accessibility by leveraging nanopores novel long-read sequencing technology. We include customized wet-lab protocols for plasmid preparation along with a pipeline designed for analysis of read data obtained using these protocols. This analysis pipeline is built into the OnRamp webapp (http://OnRamp.BoyleLab.org), which generates alignments between actual and predicted plasmid sequences, quality scores, and read-level views in a user-friendly manner, precluding the need for programming experience in analyzing nanopore results. Here we describe the OnRamp protocols and pipeline, and demonstrate our ability to obtain full sequences from pooled plasmids while detecting sequence variation even in regions of high secondary structure, at less than half the cost of equivalent Sanger sequencing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInterleukin-10 (IL-10) is essential in fetal regenerative wound healing and likewise promotes a regenerative phenotype in adult dermal wounds. However, the role of endogenous IL-10 in postnatal dermal wound healing is not well established. We sought to determine the role of IL-10 in murine full thickness, excisional wounds that are splinted to prevent contracture and mimic human patterns of wound closure.\n\nMethodsFull thickness, excisional wounds were made in wildtype (WT) and IL-10-/- mice on a C57BL/6J background (F/M, 8wks old). In a subset of wounds, contraction was prevented by splinting with silicone stents (stenting) and maintaining a moist wound microenvironment using a semi-occlusive dressing. Wounds were examined for re-epithelialization, granulation tissue deposition, and inflammatory cell infiltrate at day 7 and fibrosis and scarring at day 30 post-wounding.\n\nResultsWe observed no difference in wound healing rate between WT and IL-10-/- mice in either the stented or unstented group. At day 7, unstented IL-10-/- wounds had a larger granulation tissue area and more inflammatory infiltrate than their WT counterparts. However, we did observe more F4/80+ cell infiltrate in stented IL-10-/- wounds at day 7. At day 30, stented wounds had increased scar area and epithelial thickness compared to unstented wounds.\n\nConclusionsThese data suggest that endogenous IL-10 expression does not alter closure of full thickness excisional wounds when wound hydration and excessive contraction are controlled. However, the loss of IL-10 leads to increased inflammatory cell infiltration and scarring. These data suggest that previous reports of increased rates of healing in IL-10-/- mice ought to be revisited considering recent advances in wound healing models. Moreover, these new findings suggest that IL-10 contributes to regulation of inflammation without compromising the healing response.",

Interestingly, the localization of TLN1 is not restricted to the focal adhesions, but its function in other cellular compartments remains poorly understood. By utilizing both biochemical and confocal microscopy analyses, we show that TLN1 localizes to the nucleus and that it strongly interacts with the chromatin. Importantly, depletion of endogenous TLN1 results in extensive changes in the gene expression profile of human breast epithelial cells. To determine the impact of nuclear TLN1 on gene regulation, we expressed a TLN1 fusion protein containing a nuclear localization signal. Our results revealed that nuclear TLN1 regulates a specific subset of the TLN1-dependent genes. Taken together, we show that apart from localizing at the plasma membrane and cytoplasm, TLN1 also resides in the nucleus where it functions in the regulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Repair of DNA interstrand crosslinks (ICLs) involves a functional interplay among different DNA surveillance and repair pathways. Previous work has shown that ICL- inducing agents cause damage to Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and its pso2/snm1 mutants exhibit a petite phenotype followed by loss of mtDNA integrity and copy number. Complex as it is, the cause and underlying molecular mechanisms remains elusive. Here, by combining a wide range of approaches with in vitro and in vivo analyses, we assessed the subcellular localization and function of Pso2. We found evidence that the nuclear-encoded Pso2 contains one mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) and two nuclear localization signals (NLS1 and NLS2), although NLS1 resides within the MTS. Further analysis revealed that Pso2 is a dual-localized ICL repair protein; it can be imported into both nucleus and mitochondria, and that genotoxic agents enhance its abundance in the latter. While MTS is essential for mitochondrial Pso2 import, either NLS1 or NLS2 is sufficient for its nuclear import; this implies that the two NLS motifs are functionally redundant. Ablation of MTS abrogated mitochondrial Pso2 import, and concomitantly, raised its levels in the nucleus. Strikingly, mutational disruption of both NLS motifs blocked the nuclear Pso2 import; at the same time, they enhanced its translocation into the mitochondria, consistent with the notion that the relationship between MTS and NLS motifs is competitive. However, the nuclease activity of import-deficient species of Pso2 was not impaired. The potential relevance of dual-targeting of Pso2 into two DNA-bearing organelles is discussed.",

    "abstract": "A detailed understanding of the anatomical and molecular architectures of cells and their system-wide connectivity is essential for interrogating system function and dysfunction. Extensive efforts have been made toward characterizing cells through various approaches, and have established invaluable databases yielding new insights. However, we still lack technologies for mapping the combined multi-scale anatomical and molecular details of individual cells in the human organ-scale system. To address this challenge, we developed a fully integrated technology platform for simultaneously extracting spatial, molecular, morphological, and connectivity information of individual cells from the same human brain at single-fiber resolution. We accomplished this by seamlessly integrating new chemical, mechanical, and computational tools to enable 3D multi-scale proteomic reconstruction of human organ tissues. We developed a novel microtome, termed MEGAtome, that enables ultra-precision slicing of whole-mount intact human brain hemispheres and large arrays of organs from other species with no loss of intra- and inter-slice cellular connectivity. To preserve structural and molecular information within intact human brain slabs and to enable multiplexed multiscale imaging, we developed a tissue-gel technology, termed mELAST, that transforms human brain tissues into an elastic and reversibly expandable tissue-hydrogel. To reconstruct the 3D connectivity of axonal networks across multiple brain slabs, we developed a computational pipeline termed UNSLICE. Using the technology platform, we analyzed Alzheimers disease (AD) pathology at multiple scales from overall cytoarchitecture to individual synapses. Finally, we demonstrated the feasibility of scalable neural connectivity mapping in human brain, establishing a path for probing brain connectivity and its alterations in diseases.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryWe developed an integrated scalable platform for highly multiplexed multi-scale phenotyping and connectivity mapping in the same human brain tissue, which includes novel tissue processing, labeling, imaging, and computational reconstruction technologies.",

Synthetic biology approaches are key means to study and improve their biomining performance. However, efficient genetic manipulations in Acidithiobacillus are still major bottlenecks. In this study, we report a simple and efficient pAFi system (CRISPR-dCas9) and a scarless pAF system (CRISPR-Cas9) for genetic manipulations in A. ferridurans JAGS. The pAFi system harboring both dCas9 and sgRNA was constructed based on pBBR1MCS-2 to knockdown HdrA and TusA genes, separately, of which the transcription levels were significantly downregulated by 48% and 93%, separately. The pAF system carrying pCas9-sgRNA-homology arms was constructed based on pJRD215 to delete HdrB3 gene and overexpress Rus gene. Our results demonstrated that the pAF system is a fast and efficient genome editing method with an average rate of 15-20% per transconjugant in one recombination event, compared to 10-3 and then 10-2 in two recombination events by traditional markerless engineering strategy. Moreover, with these two systems, we successfully regulated iron and sulfur metabolisms in A. ferridurans JAGS: the deletion of HdrB3 reduced 48% of sulfate production, and substitution overexpression of Rus promoter showed 8.82-fold of mRNA level and enhanced iron oxidation rate. With these high-efficient genetic tools for A. ferridurans, we will be able to study gene functions and create useful recombinants for biomining applications.

    "abstract": "The recurrent emergence of virus diseases in intensive horticultural crops requires alternative control strategies. Topical application of dsRNA molecules homologous to pathogens has been proposed as a tool for plant virus control. These dsRNAs induce the silencing mechanism (RNAi) that degrades homologous dsRNAs. Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) represents a serious threat to cucurbit crops. Since genetic resistance to the virus is not yet available in commercial varieties, we aimed to control this virus by RNAi. For this purpose, we obtained constructions both for expressing dsRNA in bacteria to treat cucumber plants by topical application and for agroinoculation in experiments done in the growth chamber. Besides, greenhouse tests were performed in spring and in summer when plants were challenged with the virus and differences in several parameters were investigated, including severity of symptoms, dry weight, total height, virus accumulation and virus-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs). Spraying of plants with dsRNA reduced significatively CGMMV symptoms in the plants in growth chamber tests. Agroinfiltration experiments done under identical conditions were also effective in limiting the progress of CGMMV disease. In the greenhouse assay performed in spring, symptoms were significatively reduced in dsRNA-sprayed plants and the development of the plants improved with respect to non-treated plants. Virus titters and vsiRNAs were clearly reduced in dsRNA-treated plants. The effect of protection of the dsRNA was less evident in the greenhouse assay carried out in summer. Besides, we investigated the mobility of long (ds)RNA derived from spraying or agroinfiltrated dsRNA and found that it could be detected in local, close distal and far distal points from the site of application. VsiRNAs were also detected in local and distal points and the differences in accumulation were compared. In parallel, we investigated the capacity of dsRNAs derived from genes of tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), another economically important virus in cucurbits, to limit the disease in zucchini, both by agroinfiltration or direct spraying, but found no protection effect. In view of the results, topical application of dsRNAs is postulated as a promising strategy for CGMMV control in cucumber.",

    "abstract": "Metabolite-level regulation of enzyme activity is important for microbes to cope with environmental shifts. Knowledge of such regulations can also guide strain engineering to improve industrial phenotypes. Recently developed chemoproteomics workflows allow for genome-wide detection of metabolite-protein interactions that may regulate pathway activity. We applied limited proteolysis small molecule mapping (LiP-SMap) to identify and compare metabolite-protein interactions in the proteomes of two cyanobacteria and two lithoautotrophic bacteria that fix CO2 using the Calvin cycle. Clustering analysis of the hundreds of detected interactions showed that some metabolites interacted in a species-specific manner, such as interactions of glucose-6-phosphate in Cupriavidus necator and of glyoxylate in Synechocystis sp PCC 6803. These are interpreted in light of the different central carbon conversion pathways present. Metabolites interacting with the Calvin cycle enzymes fructose-1,6/sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (F/SBPase) and transketolase were tested for effects on catalytic activity in vitro. The Calvin cycle intermediate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate activated both Synechocystis and Cupriavidus F/SBPase, which suggests a feed-forward activation of the cycle in both photoautotrophs and chemolithoautotrophs. In contrast to the stimulating effect in reduced conditions, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate inactivated the Synechocystis F/SBPase in oxidized conditions by accelerating protein aggregation. Thus, metabolite-level regulation of the Calvin cycle is more prevalent than previously appreciated and may act in addition to redox regulation.",

However, the overlap across schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar (BP), and schizoaffective disorder (SAD) is not clear yet. This study focuses on finding overlap across these three psychotic disorders using dynamic FNC (dFNC) and compares it with static FNC (sFNC). We used resting-state fMRI, demographics, and clinical information from the Bipolar- Schizophrenia Network on Intermediate Phenotypes cohort. The data includes three groups of patients with schizophrenia (SZP, N=102), bipolar (BPP, N=102), and schizoaffective (SADP, N=102), their relatives SZR (N=102), BPR (N=102), SADR (N=102), and HC (N=118) groups. After estimating each individuals dFNC, we put them into three identical states. We estimated five different features, including occupancy rate (OCR), number of transitions, the total number of transitions, and the total distance traveled. Finally, the extracted features are tested statistically across patients and HC groups. In addition, we explored the link between the clinical scores and the extracted features. We found that the OCR difference between SZP and SZR in state2, between BPP and HC in state1, and between SADP and HC in state2. Also, state2 OCR separates SZP from BPP, state 3 OCR separates BPP from SZP and SADP. Moreover, the OCR and traveled distance feature extracted from SZ and BP could significantly predict PANSS Total and PANSS General scores. Finally, combined distance features of all disorders showed a significant relationship to PANSS Total and PANSS General scores.",

In the early stage of ciliogenesis, the ciliary vesicle (CV) is formed on the mother centriole, which nucleates the primary cilium. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying CV formation have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we found that the atypical small GTPase RAB-Like 3 (RABL3) is necessary to assemble primary cilia in human cells. RABL3 directly interacts with RAB11, which is involved in CV formation. RABL3 localizes around the centrosome during early ciliogenesis, reminiscent of RAB11 dynamics. Furthermore, RABL3 positively controls the CV formation like RAB11. These findings suggest that RABL3 plays an important role, in cooperation with RAB11, in CV formation during early ciliogenesis.",

This subdomain, the flagellar pocket, is a small vase-shaped invagination containing the root of the cells single flagellum. Several cytoskeleton-associated multiprotein complexes are coiled around the neck of the flagellar pocket on its cytoplasmic face. One of these, the hook complex, may affect macromolecule entry into the flagellar pocket lumen. In previous work, knockdown of the hook complex component TbMORN1 resulted in larger cargo being unable to enter the flagellar pocket. In this study, the hook complex component TbSmee1 was characterised in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei and was found to be essential for cell viability. TbSmee1 knockdown resulted in flagellar pocket enlargement, and impaired access to the pocket membrane by surface-bound cargo. Inhibition of endocytosis by knockdown of clathrin phenocopied TbSmee1 knockdown, suggesting that endocytic activity itself is a prerequisite for the entry of surface-bound cargo into the flagellar pocket.\n\nSummaryCharacterisation of the essential trypanosome protein TbSmee1 suggests that endocytosis is required for flagellar pocket access of surface-bound cargo",

Cell lose their apical membrane and epithelial adherens junctions during ingression. However, how factors that organize apical-basal polarity contribute to ingression is unknown. Here, we show that the dynamic regulation of the apical Crumbs polarity complex is crucial for normal neural stem cell ingression. Crumbs endocytosis and recycling allow ingression to occur in a normal timeframe. During early ingression, Crumbs and its complex partner the RhoGEF Cysts support myosin and apical constriction to ensure robust ingression dynamics. During late ingression, the E3-ubiquitin ligase Neuralized facilitates the disassembly of the Crumbs complex and the rapid endocytic removal of the apical cell domain. Our findings reveal a mechanism integrating cell fate, apical polarity, endocytosis, vesicle trafficking, and actomyosin contractility to promote cell ingression, a fundamental morphogenetic process observed in animal development and cancer.",

In this work, we study how bees adapt to their environment in order to regulate the comb structure. Specifically, we identify the irregularities in honeycomb structure in the presence of various geometric frustrations. We 3D-print experimental frames with a variety of constraints imposed on the imprinted foundations. The combs constructed by the bees show clear evidence of reoccurring patterns built by bees in response to specific geometric frustrations on these starter frames. Furthermore, using an experimental-modeling framework, we demonstrate that these patterns can be successfully modeled and replicated through a simulated annealing process, in which the minimized potential is a variation of the Lennard-Jones potential that only considers first-neighbor interactions according to a Delaunay triangulation. Our simulation results not only confirm the connection between honeycomb structures and other crystal systems such as graphene, but also show that irregularities in the honeycomb structure can be explained as the result of local interactions between honeybees and their immediate surroundings, leading to emergent global order. Additionally, our computational model can be used to describe specific strategies that bees use to effectively solve each geometric mismatch problem while minimizing cost of comb building.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive DNA represents an important driver of sex chromosome differentiation. Yet, repetitive sequences tend to be misrepresented or overlooked in genomic studies. We analysed repetitive DNA landscape of sex chromosomes in several populations of a turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri and its sister species N. kadleci (Teleostei: Nothobranchiidae), representatives of African annual killifishes with high rate of karyotype and sex chromosome evolution. We combined bioinformatic analyses of repeatome with molecular cytogenetic techniques such as comparative genomic hybridization, fluorescence in situ hybridization with satellite sequences, genes for ribosomal RNAs (rDNA) and bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) and immunostaining of SYCP3 and MLH1 proteins, which marked lateral elements of synaptonemal complexes and recombination sites, respectively. We revealed that N. furzeri and N. kadleci share the XY sex chromosome system, which is thus much older than previously assumed. Sex chromosomes are mostly heteromorphic as evidenced by distinct distribution of satellite DNAs and major rDNA. Yet, the heteromorphic XY sex chromosomes pair almost exclusively regularly in meiosis, which implies synaptic adjustment. Physical mapping of BACs identified inversions on Y chromosomes of the N. kadleci populations, akin to the pattern previously reported in N. furzeri. Yet, repetitive DNA landscape of X and Y sex chromosomes either diverged in parallel in populations of both species or it evolved in their common ancestor and thus predates the inversions. The observed differentiation via repeat repatterning thus cannot be explained by the classical sexually antagonistic model. Rather, we hypothesized that relaxed meiotic drive and recombination reduced by neutral processes could drive changes in repeatome and secondary inversions could be maintained by sexually antagonistic regulatory effects resulting from early evolution of dosage compensation.\n\nAuthor summaryEarly differentiation of sex chromosomes is not yet satisfactorily understood despite intensive research effort. Homomorphic sex chromosomes and their rapid turnover are common in teleost fishes, which makes them excellent models for studying evolution of nascent sex chromosomes. We investigated sex chromosomes in several populations of two sister species of African annual killifishes, Nothobranchius furzeri and N. kadleci, particularly their repetitive landscape, which was misrepresented in previous genomic studies. Combination of cytogenetic and genomic approaches revealed that both species share heteromorphic XY sex chromosome system. The N. furzeri XY sex chromosomes thus evolved earlier than previously expected. In N. kadleci, Y-linked inversions analogous to those reported in N. furzeri were detected. Changes in repetitive DNA distribution on sex chromosomes are either convergent or occurred in a common ancestor of both species, prior to the inversion events. The observed sex chromosome differentiation on repetitive DNA level thus cannot be reconciled with the classical theoretical model of sex chromosome evolution driven by sexually antagonistic selection. We invoke alternative explanations such as relaxed meiotic drive and recombination reduced by neutral processes, and we hypothesize that secondary inversions could be maintained by early evolution of dosage compensation resulting in sexually antagonistic regulatory effects.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genomes exhibit widespread horizontal gene transfer, resulting in highly variable genome content that complicates the inference of genetic interactions. In this study, we develop a method for detecting coevolving genes from large datasets of bacterial genomes that we call a \"coevolution score\". The method is based on pairwise comparisons of closely related individuals, analogous to a pedigree study in eukaryotic populations. This approach avoids the need for an accurate phylogenetic tree and allows very large datasets to be analyzed for signatures of recent coevolution. We apply our method to all of the more than 3 million pairs of genes from the entire annotated Staphylococcus aureus accessory genome of 2,756 annotated genes using a database of over 40,000 whole genomes. We find many pairs of genes that that appear to be gained or lost in a coordinated manner, as well as pairs where the gain of one gene is associated with the loss of the other. These pairs form networks of dozens of rapidly coevolving genes, primarily consisting of genes involved in metal resistance, virulence, mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer, and antibiotic resistance, particularly the SCCmec complex. Our results reflect the fact that the evolution of many bacterial pathogens since the middle of the twentieth century has largely been driven by antibiotic resistance gene gain, and in the case of S. aureus the SCCmec complex is the most prominent of these elements driving the evolution of resistance. The frequent coincidence of these gene gain or loss events suggests that S. aureus switch between antibiotic-resistant niches and antibiotic-susceptible ones. While we focus on gene gain and loss, our method can also detect genes which tend to acquire substitutions in tandem or, in datasets that include phenotypic information, genotype-phenotype or phenotype-phenotype coevolution.",

In 2017, we curated the RNA-targeted BIoactive ligaNd Database (R-BIND) and discovered distinguishing physicochemical properties of RNA-targeting ligands, leading us to propose the existence of an \"RNA-privileged\" chemical space. Biennial updates of the database and the establishment of a website platform (rbind.chem.duke.edu) have provided new insights and tools to design small molecules based on the analyzed physicochemical and spatial properties. In this report and R-BIND 2.0 update, we refined the curation approach and ligand classification system as well as conducted analyses of RNA structure elements for the first time to identify new targeting strategies. Specifically, we curated and analyzed RNA target structural motifs to determine properties of small molecules that may confer selectivity for distinct RNA secondary and tertiary structures. Additionally, we collected sequences of target structures and incorporated an RNA Structure Search algorithm into the website that outputs small molecules targeting similar motifs without a priori secondary structure knowledge. Cheminformatic analyses revealed that, despite the 50% increase in small molecule library size, the distinguishing properties of R-BIND ligands remained significantly different to that of proteins and are therefore still relevant to RNA-targeted probe discovery. Combined, we expect these novel insights and website features to enable rational design of RNA-targeted ligands and to serve as a resource and inspiration for a variety of scientists interested in RNA targeting.",

    "abstract": "Helicase domain of nonstructural protein 3 (NS3H) unwinds double-stranded RNA replication intermediate during flavivirus life cycle in ATP-dependent manner. While the helicases mechanism of Dengue and Zika viruses has been extensively studied, little is known about helicase activity of the tick-borne encephalitis virus NS3. In the current study, we demonstrated that ATP hydrolysis cycle of NS3H is strongly stimulated by ssRNA but not ssDNA, suggesting that NS3H is an RNA-specific helicase. However, ssDNA binding inhibits ATPase activity in a non-competitive manner. We also captured several structural snapshots of key ATP hydrolysis stages. An intermediate, in which the inorganic phosphate (Pi) and ADP resulted from ATP hydrolysis and remain trapped inside the ATPase site, suggests that Pi release is the rate-limiting step and is accelerated by RNA binding and/or translocation. Based on these structures, we modeled NS3H-ssRNA and -ssDNA binding and performed MD simulations. Our model suggests that NS3H-ssRNA binding triggers conformational changes, revealing the coupling between helicase and ATPase activities. The structural models revealed that ssDNA inhibition may occur via non-specific ssDNA binding to several positively charged surface patches which in turn causes repositioning of ATP molecule within the ATPase site.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) offers unprecedented insight into heterogenous biology, allowing for the interrogation of cellular populations and gene expression programs at single-cell resolution. Here, we introduce scPipeline, a single-cell analytic toolbox that offers modular workflows for multi-level cellular annotation and user-friendly analysis reports. Novel methods that are introduced to facilitate scRNA-seq annotation include: (i) co-dependency index (CDI)-based differential expression; (ii) cluster resolution optimization using a marker-specificity criterion; (iii) marker-based cell-type annotation with Miko scoring; and (iv) gene program discovery using scale-free shared nearest neighbor network (SSN) analysis. Our unsupervised and supervised procedures were validated using a diverse collection of scRNA-seq datasets and we provide illustrative examples of cellular and transcriptomic annotation of developmental and immunological scRNA-seq atlases. Overall, scPipeline provides a flexible computational framework for in-depth scRNA-seq analysis.",

Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) requires statistical and computational training, which can present a barrier to access for some researchers. The QTLViewer software is graphical user interface webtool for CC and DO studies that performs QTL mapping through the R/qtl2 package.

    "abstract": "Flaviviruses comprise a large group of arboviral species that are distributed in several countries of the tropics, neotropics, and some temperate zones. Since they can produce neurological pathologies or vascular damage, there has been intense research seeking better diagnosis and treatments for their infections in the last decades. The flavivirus NS1 protein is a relevant clinical target because it is involved in viral replication, immune evasion, and virulence. Being a key factor in endothelial and tissue-specific modulation, NS1 has been largely studied to understand the molecular mechanisms exploited by the virus to reprogram host cells. A central part of the viral maturation processes is the NS1 oligomerization because many stages rely on these protein-protein assemblies. In the present study, the self-associations of NS1 proteins from Zika, Dengue, and West Nile viruses are examined through constant-pH coarse-grained biophysical simulations. Free energies of interactions were estimated for different oligomeric states and pH conditions. Our results show that these proteins can form both dimers and tetramers under conditions near physiological pH even without the presence of lipids. Moreover, pH plays an important role mainly controlling the regimes where van der Waals interactions govern their association. Finally, despite the similarity at the sequence level, we found that each flavivirus has a well-characteristic protein-protein interaction profile. These specific features can provide new hints for the development of binders both for better diagnostic tools and the formulation of new therapeutic drugs.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=137 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/484429v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1221d69org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b90429org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c039c3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1039cc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Recent work has raised awareness about the need to replace bar graphs of continuous data with informative graphs showing the data distribution. The impact of these efforts is not known. This observational meta-research study examined how often scientists in different fields use various graph types, and assessed whether visualization practices have changed between 2010 and 2020. We developed and validated an automated screening tool, designed to identify bar graphs of counts or proportions, bar graphs of continuous data, bar graphs with dot plots, dot plots, box plots, violin plots, histograms, pie charts, and flow charts. Papers from 23 fields (approximately 1,000 papers/field/year) were randomly selected from PubMed Central and screened (n=227,998). F1 scores for different graphs ranged between 0.83 and 0.95 in the internal validation set. While the tool also performed well in external validation sets, F1 scores were lower for uncommon graphs. Bar graphs are more often used incorrectly to display continuous data than they are used correctly to display counts or proportions. The proportion of papers that use bar graphs of continuous data varies markedly across fields (range in 2020: 4%-58%), with high rates in biochemistry and cell biology, complementary and alternative medicine, physiology, genetics, oncology and carcinogenesis, pharmacology, microbiology and immunology. Visualization practices have improved in some fields in recent years. Fewer than 25% of papers use flow charts, which provide information about attrition and the risk of bias. This study highlights the need for continued interventions to improve visualization and identifies fields that would benefit most.",

    "abstract": "Chronic wounds impose a significant healthcare burden to a broad patient population. Cell based therapies, while having shown benefits for the treatment of chronic wounds, have not achieved widespread adoption into clinical practice. Here, we developed a novel CRISPR/Cas9 approach to precisely edit dendritic cells (DCs) to enhance their therapeutic potential for healing chronic wounds. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of tolerogenic DCs, we discover N-myc downregulated gene 2 (Ndrg2), which marks a specific population of DC progenitors, as a promising target for CRISPR knockout (KO). Ndrg2-KO alters the transcriptomic profile of DCs and preserves an immature cell state with a strong, pro-angiogenic and regenerative capacity. We then incorporated our CRISPR-based cell engineering within a hydrogel technology for in vivo cell delivery and developed a highly effective translational approach for DC based immunotherapy that accelerated healing of full-thickness wounds in both non-diabetic and diabetic mouse models. These findings could open the door to future clinical trials using safe gene editing in DCs for treating various types of chronic wounds.",

    "abstract": "Composite indices have been widely used to rank the environmental performance of nations. Such environmental indices can be useful in communicating complex information as a single value and have the potential to generate political and media awareness of environmental issues. However, indices that are poorly constructed can hinder efforts to identify environmental failings. Here, we provide a critical review of the theoretical and methodological foundations of environmental indices to enhance our understanding of the accuracy and applicability of such indices. In the present study we classify existing indices according to ranking goal, measurement components, and weighting methods. Using New Zealand and Niger as case studies, we examine correlations between ranks in ten national level indices to outline how measurement components and the goal of ranking itself may provide a more, or less, optimistic view of the state of a countrys environment. Our results suggest that environmental indices that include human health, socioeconomic, and policy indicators (such as human access to sanitation and clean drinking water) are positively correlated with each other, and that those excluding human health, socioeconomic, and policy indicators are also positively correlated with each other, while these two types of environmental indices are negatively correlated to each other. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion of indicators that do not relate to the actual state of natural environments can confound results. When choosing an existing environmental index - or developing a new one - it is important to assess whether the ranking goal and the included indicators are appropriate. This is important because the inclusion of confounding indicators in environmental indices may misrepresent the actual state of natural environments.",

The method, known as the Quantitative Method, has also been suggested as a future regulatory standard for the United States and internationally. The multi-lab study was carried out using Pseudomonas aeruginosa and an alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride antimicrobial product diluted in hard water. Results of the study showed acceptable repeatability in log10 reductions within each laboratory, but unacceptable reproducibility across laboratories despite careful analyst training and standardization of test conditions. A follow-up study ruled out analyst-to-analyst differences as the cause of the poor reproducibility. As it currently exists, the Quantitative Method is not sufficiently reproducible. Ruggedness testing to assess the sensitivity of the method to small changes in operational factors is recommended.",

    "abstract": "Biosurfactants reduce surface and interfacial tension due to their amphiphilic properties, and are an eco-friendly alternative for chemical surfactants. In this study, a novel yeast strain JAF-11 that produces biosurfactant was selected using drop collapse method, and the properties of the material were investigated. The nucleotide sequences of the strain were compared with closely related strains and identified based on the D1/D2 domain of the large-subunit rDNA (LSU) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions. Neodothiora populina CPC 39399T, the closest species with strain JAF-11 in the phylogenetic tree, showed a sequence similarity of 97.75% for LSU and 94.27% for ITS, respectively. The result suggests that the strain JAF-11 represent a distinct species which cannot be assigned to any existing genus or species in the family Dothideaceae. Strain JAF-11 was able to produce biosurfactant reducing the surface tension of medium to 34.5 mN/m on the 6th day of culture and the result of measuring the critical micelle concentration (CMC) by extracting the crude biosurfactant was found to be 24 mg l-1. The molecular weight 502 of the purified biosurfactant was confirmed by measuring the fast atom bombardment mass spectrum (FAB-MS). The chemical structure was analyzed by measuring 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, two-dimensional NMRs of the compound. The molecular formula was C26H46O9, and it was composed of one octanoyl group and two hexanoyl group to myo-inositol moiety. The new biosurfactant is the first report of a compound produced by a novel yeast strain JAF-11. This new biosurfactant is proposed as potential candidate for use in a variety field.",
