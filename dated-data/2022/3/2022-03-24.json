    "abstract": "The miRNA miR-124 has been employed supplementary to neurogenic TFs and other miRNAs to enhance direct neurogenic conversion by suppressing multiple non-neuronal targets. Aim of the study was to investigate whether miR-124 is sufficient to drive direct reprogramming of astrocytes to induced-neurons (iNs) on its own and elucidate its independent mechanism of reprogramming action. Our data show that miR-124 is a potent driver of the reprogramming switch of astrocytes towards an immature neuronal fate, by directly targeting the RNA-binding protein Zfp36l1 implicated in ARE-mediated mRNA decay and subsequently de-repressing Zfp36l1 neurogenic interactome. To this end miR-124 contribution in iNs production largely recapitulates endogenous neurogenesis pathways, being further enhanced upon addition of the neurogenic compound ISX9, which greatly improves both miR-124-induced reprogramming efficiency and iNs functional maturation. Importantly, miR-124 is potent to guide direct conversion of reactive astrocytes to immature iNs of cortical identity in vivo following cortical trauma, confirming its  master reprogramming capacity within the injured cortical microenvironment, while ISX9 supplementation confers a survival advantage to newly produced iNs.",

    "abstract": "The establishment of mixed forest stands can be seen as an option to improve soil nutrient conditions and to protect forest ecosystems from various impacts of climate change. Our study analyzed groups of pure mature European beech (Fagus sylvatica; B), Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii; D) and Norway spruce (Picea abies; S) stands as well as mixtures of beech with either Douglas fir (DB) or spruce (SB), i.e. 5 forest stands per site along Northern Germany with two regionally clearly differing sites conditions (i.e., 3 loess-influenced, loamy sites in the Solling region, southern Lower Saxony and 4 sandy lowland sites further north). In order to determine possible influences of the tree species and their mixtures on soil properties, the organic layer and the mineral topsoil were first chemically characterized for all 35 plots down to a depth of 30 cm (pH, C, N, P, CEC, exchangeable nutrient cation contents and stocks, base saturation-BS). Our results indicated, independent of sites condition, that pure S stands showed the lowest pH and BS, meanwhile B the highest BS. The impact of D varied depending on site condition. On sandy soils, pure D showed higher pH and BS than under pure S, while on loamy soils the pH under D and B was lower than under S. Regarding cations stocks under sandy soils conditions, S stands and its admixture SB depleted soil Ca and Mg stocks more than pure D and B. In contrast, under loamy soil conditions B showed depleted (lowest) soil exchangeable Ca and Mg stocks more than under S stands. Soil exchangeable K under mixed stands were among the highest compared to pure stands, independent of the site condition. Thus, mixed species stands generally decreased soil base cation depletion compared to pure conifer stands. Admixtures of Douglas-fir (DB) seem to lead to smaller changes in pH, CEC and BS than those of Norway spruce, this effect become more important at sandy soil sites. Therefore, forest management may consider mixtures of European beech and Douglas fir as a reasonable management option without apprehending negative effects on soil chemistry.",

    "abstract": "The environmental context of the nitrogen-fixing mutualism between leguminous plants and rhizobial bacteria varies over space and time. Variation in resource availability, population density, and composition likely affect the ecology and evolution of rhizobia and their symbiotic interactions with hosts. We examined how host genotype, nitrogen addition, rhizobial density, and community complexity affected selection on 68 rhizobia strains in the Ensifer meliloti - Medicago truncatula mutualism. As expected, the host genotype had the most substantial effect on the size, number, and strain composition of root nodules (the symbiotic organ). The understudied environmental variable of rhizobial density had a more significant effect on strain frequency in nodules than the addition of low nitrogen levels. Higher inoculum density resulted in a nodule community that was less diverse and more beneficial but only in the context of the more selective host genotype. Higher density resulted in more diverse and less beneficial nodule communities with the less selective host. Density effects on strain composition deserve additional scrutiny as they can create eco-evolutionary feedback. Lastly, we found that relative strain rankings were stable across increasing community complexity (community complexity (2, 3, 8, or 68 strains). This unexpected result suggests that higher-order interactions between strains are rare in the context of host nodule formation and development. Taken together, our empirical work highlights the importance of developing new theoretical predictions that incorporate density dependence. Further, it has translational relevance for overcoming establishment barriers in bio-inoculants and motivating host breeding programs that maintain beneficial plant-microbe interactions across diverse agro-ecological contexts.\n\nIMPORTANCELegume cash, forage, and cover crops establish beneficial associations with rhizobial bacteria who perform biological nitrogen fixation (BNF)--providing Nitrogen (N) fertilizer to plants without the economic and greenhouse gas emission costs of chemical N inputs. Here, for the first time, we examine the relative influence of three environmental factors that vary in agricultural fields on strain relative fitness in nodules when scores rhizobial strains compete. In addition to manipulating Nitrogen, we also use two biotic variables that have rarely been examined: the rhizobial communitys density and complexity. Taken together, our results suggest 1) breeding legume varieties that select beneficial strains despite environmental variation are possible, 2) changes in rhizobial population densities that occur routinely in agricultural fields could drive evolutionary changes in rhizobia populations, and 3) the lack of higher-order interactions between strains will allow the high-throughput assessments of rhizobia winners and losers during plant interactions.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control transgene expression, both spatially and temporally, is essential for studying model organisms. In Drosophila, spatial control is primarily provided by the GAL4/UAS system, whilst temporal control relies on a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (which inhibits GAL4) and drug-inducible systems. However, these are not ideal. Shifting temperature can impact on many physiological and behavioural traits, and the current drug-inducible systems are either leaky, toxic, incompatible with existing GAL4-driver lines, or do not generate effective levels of expression. Here we describe the Auxin-inducible Gene Expression System (AGES). AGES relies on the auxin-dependent degradation of a ubiquitously expressed GAL80, and therefore, is compatible with existing GAL4-driver lines. Water-soluble auxin is added to fly food at a low, non-lethal, concentration, which induces expression comparable to uninhibited GAL4 expression. The system works in both larvae and adults, providing a stringent, non-lethal, cost-effective, and convenient method for temporally controlling GAL4 activity in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Learned movements can be skillfully performed at different paces. What neural strategies produce this flexibility? Can they be predicted and understood by network modeling? We trained monkeys to perform a cycling task at different speeds, and trained artificial recurrent networks to generate the empirical muscle-activity patterns. Network solutions reflected the principle that smooth well-behaved dynamics require low trajectory tangling. Network solutions had a consistent form, which yielded quantitative and qualitative predictions. To evaluate predictions, we analyzed motor cortex activity recorded during the same task. Responses supported the hypothesis that the dominant neural signals reflect not muscle activity, but network-level strategies for generating muscle activity. Single-neuron responses were better accounted for by network activity than by muscle activity. Similarly, neural population trajectories shared their organization not with muscle trajectories, but with network solutions. Thus, cortical activity could be understood based on the need to generate muscle activity via dynamics that allow smooth, robust control over movement speed.",

There is no doubt that fully simulating the advanced structure of this homotrimer in the subunit vaccine development strategy is the most likely way to improve the immune protective effect of the vaccine. In this study, the preparation strategies of S protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) trimer, S1 region trimer, and ectodomain (ECD) trimer nanoparticles were designed based on ferritin nanoparticle self-assembly technology. The Bombyx mori baculovirus expression system was used to prepare these three nanoparticle vaccines with high expression levels in the silkworm. The immune results of mice show that the nanoparticle vaccine prepared by this strategy can not only induce an immune response by subcutaneous administration but also effective by oral administration. Given the stability of these ferritin-based nanoparticles vaccine, easy-to-use and low-cost oral immunization strategy can make up for the vaccination blind areas caused by the shortage of ultralow-temperature equipment and medical resources in underdeveloped areas. And the oral vaccine is also a very potential candidate to cut off the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic and farmed animals, especially in stray and wild animals.",

    "abstract": "The times between appearance of successive leaves or phyllochron characterize the vegetative development of annual plants. Hypothesis testing models, which enables to compare phyllochron between genetic groups or conditions, are usually based on regression of thermal time on the number of leaves, most of the time assuming a constant leaf appearance rate. However these models are both statistically biased and inappropriate in terms of modelling. We propose a stochastic process model in which the emergence of new leaves is considered as successive time-to-events, which provides a flexible and more accurate modelling as well as unbiased testing procedures. The model was applied on an original maize dataset collected in fields for three years on plants originating from two divergent selection experiments for flowering time conducted in two maize inbred lines. We showed that the main differences in phyllochron were not observed between selection populations (Early or Late), but rather between ancestral lines, years of experimentation, and leaf ranks. Our results highlight a strong departure from the assumption of a constant leaf appearance rate in one year that could be related to climate variations, even if the impact of each climatic variables individually was not clearly elucidated.",

Recently, the KRAS G12C inhibitor have been clinically approved, but inhibitors for KRAS G12D/V are still under development. Here, we described the development of a novel chemical knockdown strategy, termed CANDDY (Chemical knockdown with Affinity aNd Degradation DYnamics). This strategy involves a CANDDY tag modified from a proteasome inhibitor inducing direct proteasomal degradation. We constructed TUS-007 as a multispecific small molecule tethered from a KRAS interactor and CANDDY tag to target KRAS G12D/V. We confirmed that the degradation by TUS-007 was independent of target ubiquitination. This allows to solve a laborious design of matchmaker in the current ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis technology. And TUS-007 successfully suppressed tumors due to in vivo degradation of KRAS G12D/V. The CANDDY technology could represent a simple and rational strategy to degrade currently \"undruggable\" proteins.",

However, the emergence of variants of concern has negatively impacted the therapeutic use of some authorized mAbs. Using a high throughput B-cell screening pipeline, we isolated a highly potent SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein receptor binding domain (RBD)-specific antibody called LY-CoV1404 (also known as bebtelovimab). LY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes authentic SARS-CoV-2 virus, including the prototype, B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and B.1.617.2). In pseudovirus neutralization studies, LY-CoV1404 retains potent neutralizing activity against numerous variants including B.1.1.7, B.1.351, B.1.617.2, B.1.427/B.1.429, P.1, B.1.526, B.1.1.529, and the BA.2 subvariant and retains binding to spike proteins with a variety of underlying RBD mutations including K417N, L452R, E484K, and N501Y. Structural analysis reveals that the contact residues of the LY-CoV1404 epitope are highly conserved with the exception of N439 and N501. Notably, the binding and neutralizing activity of LY-CoV1404 is unaffected by the most common mutations at these positions (N439K and N501Y). The breadth of reactivity to amino acid substitutions present among current VOC together with broad and potent neutralizing activity and the relatively conserved epitope suggest that LY-CoV1404 has the potential to be an effective therapeutic agent to treat all known variants causing COVID-19.\n\nIn BriefLY-CoV1404 is a potent SARS-CoV-2-binding antibody that neutralizes all known variants of concern and whose epitope is rarely mutated.\n\nHighlightsO_LILY-CoV1404 potently neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 authentic virus and known variants of concern including the B.1.1.529 (Omicron), the BA.2 Omicron subvariant, and B.1.617.2 (Delta) variants\nC_LIO_LINo loss of potency against currently circulating variants\nC_LIO_LIBinding epitope on RBD of SARS-CoV-2 is rarely mutated in GISAID database\nC_LIO_LIBreadth of neutralizing activity and potency supports clinical development\nC_LI",

Our genetics network uses hierarchical graph convolution and pooling operations to embed subject-level data onto a low-dimensional latent space. The hierarchical network implicitly tracks the convergence of genetic risk across well-established biological pathways, while an attention mechanism automatically identifies the salient edges of this network at the subject level. In parallel, our imaging network projects multimodal data onto a set of latent embeddings. For interpretability, we implement a Bayesian feature selection strategy to extract the discriminative imaging biomarkers; these feature weights are optimized alongside the other model parameters. We couple the imaging and genetic embeddings with a predictor network, to ensure that the learned representations are linked to phenotype. We evaluate our framework on a schizophrenia dataset that includes two functional MRI paradigms and gene scores derived from Single Nucleotide Polymorphism data. Using repeated 10-fold cross-validation, we show that our imaging-genetics fusion achieves the better classification performance than state-of-the-art baselines. In an exploratory analysis, we further show that the biomarkers identified by our model are reproducible and closely associated with deficits in schizophrenia.",

Here we show that in Drosophila NOC1 is essential for the correct animal development, and that its ubiquitous downregulation results in small larvae with reduced polysome abundance and decreased protein synthesis. NOC1 expression in multiple organs, such as the prothoracic gland and the fat body, is necessary for proper organ functioning. Reduction of NOC1 in clones from the imaginal discs results in small clones with cells that die by apoptosis, an event that is partially rescued using a M/+ background, suggesting that reduction of NOC1 causes the cells to acquire a loser state. This event was supported also by an increase in the transcription of Xrp1 and by activation of the pro-apoptotic eiger-JNK pathway, resulting in the upregulation of DILP8 as an indication of cellular damage. Here, we show that Drosophila NOC1 is important in the control of pre-rRNAs maturation and essential step in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and its downregulation results in defects in growth and in cell competition, highlighting its novel function in this field.\n\nsummary statementNOC1 is a nucleolar protein necessary for protein synthesis and ribosomal assembling.

    "abstract": "Identifying chemical regulators of biological pathways is a time-consuming bottleneck in developing therapeutics and research compounds. Typically, thousands to millions of candidate small molecules are tested in target-based biochemical screens or phenotypic cell-based screens, both expensive experiments customized to each disease. Here, our uncustomized, virtual profile-based screening approach instead identifies compounds that match to pathways based on phenotypic information in public cell image data, created using the Cell Painting assay. Our straightforward correlation-based computational strategy retrospectively uncovered the expected, known small molecule regulators for 32% of positive-control gene queries. In prospective, discovery mode, we efficiently identified new compounds related to three query genes, and validated them in subsequent gene-relevant assays, including compounds that phenocopy or pheno-oppose YAP1 overexpression and kill a Yap1-dependent sarcoma cell line. This image profile-based approach could replace many customized labor- and resource-intensive screens and accelerate the discovery of biologically and therapeutically useful compounds.\n\nOne sentence summaryIf a genetic perturbation impacts cell morphology, a computational query can reveal compounds whose morphology \"matches\".",

    "abstract": "TOP1MT encodes a mitochondrial topoisomerase that is important for mtDNA regulation, and that is involved in mitochondrial replication, transcription and translation. Two variants predicted to affect TOP1MT function (V1 - R198C and V2 - V338L) were identified by exome sequencing of a newborn with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As no pathogenic TOP1MT variants had been confirmed previously, we characterized these variants for their ability to rescue several TOP1MT functions in knockout cells. Consistent with these TOP1MT variants contributing to the patient phenotype, comprehensive characterization suggests that both variants had impaired activity. Critically, neither variant was able to restore steady state levels of mitochondrial-encoded proteins, nor reduced oxidative phosphorylation when re-expressed in TOP1MT knockout cells. However, the two variants behaved differently in some respects. While the V1 variant was better at restoring transcript levels, the V2 variant was able to restore mtDNA copy number and replication. These findings suggest that the different TOP1MT variants affect distinct TOP1MT functions. Altogether, these findings begin to provide insight into the many roles that TOP1MT plays in the maintenance and expression of the mitochondrial genome, and how impairments in this important protein may lead to human pathology.",

EGCs retain capacity for large-scale neurogenesis in culture, and in vivo lineage tracing has identified neurons derived from glial cells in response to inflammation. We thus hypothesize that EGCs possess a chromatin structure poised for neurogenesis. We use single-cell multiome sequencing to assess EGCs undergoing spontaneous neurogenesis in culture, as well as freshly isolated small intestine myenteric plexus EGCs. Cultured EGCs maintain open chromatin at genomic loci accessible in neurons, and neurogenesis from EGCs involves dynamic chromatin rearrangements with a net decrease in accessible chromatin. Multiome analysis of freshly isolated EGCs reveals transcriptional diversity, with open chromatin at neuron-associated genomic elements. A subset of EGCs, highly enriched within the myenteric ganglia, has a gene expression program and chromatin state consistent with neurogenic potential.",

    "abstract": "Torpor is a naturally occurring, hypometabolic, hypothermic state engaged by a wide range of animals in response to imbalance between the supply and demand for nutrients. Recent work has identified some of the key neuronal populations involved in daily torpor induction in mice, in particular projections from the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (POA) to the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH). The DMH plays a role in thermoregulation, control of energy expenditure, and circadian rhythms, making it well positioned to contribute to the expression of torpor. We used activity dependent genetic TRAPing techniques to target DMH neurons that were active during natural torpor bouts in female mice. Chemogenetic reactivation of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons in calorie-restricted mice promoted torpor, resulting in longer and deeper torpor bouts. Chemogenetic inhibition of torpor-TRAPed DMH neurons did not block torpor entry, suggesting a modulatory role for the DMH in the control of torpor. This work adds to the evidence that the POA and the DMH form part of a circuit within the mouse hypothalamus that controls entry into daily torpor.\n\nSignificanceDaily heterotherms such as mice employ torpor to cope with environments in which the supply of metabolic fuel is not sufficient for the maintenance of normothermia. Daily torpor involves reductions in body temperature, as well as active suppression of heart rate and metabolism. How the central nervous system controls this profound deviation from normal homeostasis is not known, but a projection from the preoptic area to the dorsomedial hypothalamus has recently been implicated. We demonstrate that the dorsomedial hypothalamus contains neurons that are active during torpor. Activity in these neurons promotes torpor entry and maintenance, but their activation alone does not appear to be sufficient for torpor entry.",

    "abstract": "The seed protein functions and their localization in seed storage protein bodies (SSPB) are known for several decades. However, the structural and functional complexity of these SSPB is not known. Interestingly, the plant SSPB is morphologically similar to the amyloid-containing protein bodies found in other organisms and individual SSPB proteins were previously shown to form fibrillar structures under non-native conditions in-vitro. Therefore, we hypothesized that the seed storage protein bodies (SSPB) may have similar structures in-vivo for controlling seed functions. Since comprehensive in-vivo characterization of the SSPB and the structure-function relationship remains unexplored, we show firstly that wheat, barley, chickpea, and mungbean SSPB exhibit a speckled-pattern of amyloids interspersed in an amyloid-like matrix in-situ, suggesting their composite nature. This is confirmed by multiple amyloid-specific probes, biophysical characterization, electron-microscopy, peptide-fingerprinting, and differential degradation during germination. Moreover, the role of amyloid composites in seed germination is proved by the effect of signalling molecules and their correlation to germination parameters, using in-situ seed sections, ex-vivo protoplasts and in-vitro SSPB. These results would lay down foundation for understanding the amyloid composite structure during SSPB biogenesis and their structure-function evolution. It would further facilitate the exploration of molecular and atomic-level structural details of SSPB amyloids.\n\nSummaryO_ST_ABSRationaleC_ST_ABSThe function of plant seed storage protein bodies (SSPB) in germination is known for decades. SSPB have aggregated and electron-rich morphology. However their structural complexity remains elusive. Based on their morphological similarity to amyloid-containing protein-bodies of other organisms, and amyloid formation by some plant proteins under non-native conditions, we hypothesized that SSPB might contain in-vivo amyloid structures for modulating seed functions.\n\nMethodsTo unambiguously identify seed amyloids in the presence of complex carbohydrate-structures of plant tissues, multi-spectral methods were used including amyloid-staining probes, high-resolution-transmission-electron-microscopy, x-ray diffraction and infra-red-spectroscopy. SSPB amyloids role in germination was shown using amyloid probes, MS/MS analysis, and plant hormones/proteases in-situ seed-sections and ex-vivo protoplasts.\n\nKey resultsThe SSPB exhibit a composite structure of amyloid, amyloid-like aggregates and soluble proteins. During germination phases, the amyloids degrade slowly compared to the amyloid-like structures. Inhibition of amyloid degradation results in lower germination-index, confirming amyloids role in germination and seedling-growth.\n\nConclusionThe study for the first time illustrates the presence of composite amyloid structures in-vivo in plant seeds and determines their function in seed germination and seedling-growth. It would open original research questions for decrypting composite amyloid structure formation during SSPB biogenesis and their evolutionary advancement across plant species.",

    "abstract": "The erosion of functional diversity may foster the collapse of ecological systems. Functional diversity is ultimately determined by the distribution of species traits. As species traits are a legacy of species evolutionary history, one might expect that the mode of trait evolution influences community resistance under the loss of functional diversity. In this paper, we investigate the role of trait evolutionary dynamics on the robustness of mutualistic networks undergoing the following scenarios of species loss: i) random extinctions, ii) loss of functional distinctiveness and iii) extinctions biased towards larger sizes. We simulated networks defined by models of single trait complementary and evolutionary modes where traits can arise in recent diversification events with weak phylogenetic signal, in early diversification events with strong phylogenetic signal, or as a random walk through evolutionary time. Our simulations show that mutualistic networks are especially vulnerable to extinctions based on trait distinctiveness and more robust to random extinction dynamics. The networks show an intermediate level of robustness against size-based extinctions. Despite the small range of variation in network robustness, our results show that the mode of trait evolution matters for network robustness in all three scenarios. Networks with low phylogenetic signal are more robust than networks with high phylogenetic signal across all scenarios. As a consequence, our results predict that mutualistic networks based upon current adaptations are more likely to cope with extinction dynamics than those networks that are based upon conserved traits.",

An emerging mechanism mediating mRNA trafficking is microtubule- dependent co-transport on shuttling endosomes. Although progress has been made in identifying various components of the endosomal mRNA transport machinery, a mechanistic understanding of how these RNA-binding proteins are connected to endosomes is still lacking. Here, we demonstrate that a flexible MademoiseLLE (MLLE) domain platform within RNA- binding protein Rrm4 of Ustilago maydis is crucial for endosomal attachment. Our structure/function analysis uncovered three MLLE domains at the C-terminus of Rrm4 with a functionally defined hierarchy. MLLE3 recognises two PAM2-like sequences of the adaptor protein Upa1 and is essential for endosomal shuttling of Rrm4. MLLE1 and MLLE2 are most likely accessory domains exhibiting a variable binding mode for interaction with currently unknown partners. Thus, endosomal attachment of the mRNA transporter is orchestrated by a sophisticated MLLE domain binding platform.",

    "abstract": "Most animal cells are surrounded by a cell membrane and an underlying actomyosin cortex. Both structures are linked, and they are under tension. In-plane membrane tension and cortical tension both influence many cellular processes, including cell migration, division, and endocytosis. However, while actomyosin tension is regulated by substrate stiffness, how membrane tension responds to mechanical substrate properties is currently poorly understood. Here, we probed the effective membrane tension of neurons and fibroblasts cultured on glass and polyacrylamide substrates of varying stiffness using optical tweezers. In contrast to actomyosin-based traction forces, both peak forces and steady state tether forces of cells cultured on hydrogels were independent of substrate stiffness and did not change after blocking myosin II activity using blebbistatin, indicating that tether and traction forces are not directly linked. Peak forces in fibroblasts on hydrogels were about twice as high as those in neurons, indicating stronger membrane-cortex adhesion in fibroblasts. Steady state tether forces were generally higher in cells cultured on hydrogels than on glass, which we explain by a mechanical model. Our results provide new insights into the complex regulation of effective membrane tension and pave the way for a deeper understanding of the biological processes it instructs.",

Supporting the model that Tfap2 facilitates MITFs ability to activate expression of pigmentation genes, single-cell seq analysis of zebrafish embryos revealed that pigmentation genes are only expressed in the subset of mitfa- expressing cells that also express Tfap2 paralogs. To test this model in SK-MEL-28 melanoma cells we deleted the two TFAP2 paralogs with highest expression, TFAP2A and TFAP2C, creating TFAP2 knockout (TFAP2-KO) cells. We then assessed gene expression, chromatin accessibility, binding of TFAP2A and of MITF, and the chromatin marks H3K27Ac and H3K27Me3 which are characteristic of active enhancers and silenced chromatin, respectively. Integrated analyses of these datasets indicate TFAP2 paralogs directly activate enhancers near genes enriched for roles in pigmentation and proliferation, and directly repress enhancers near genes enriched for roles in cell adhesion. Consistently, compared to WT cells, TFAP2-KO cells proliferate less and adhere to one another more. TFAP2 paralogs and MITF co-operatively activate a subset of enhancers, with the latter necessary for MITF binding and chromatin accessibility. By contrast, TFAP2 paralogs and MITF do not appear to co-operatively inhibit enhancers. These studies reveal a mechanism by which TFAP2 profoundly influences the set of genes activated by MITF, and thereby the phenotype of pigment cells and melanoma cells.",

    "abstract": "It is often claimed that tools are embodied by the user, but whether the brain actually repurposes its body-based computations to perform similar tasks with tools is not known. A fundamental computation for localizing touch on the body is trilateration. Here, the location of touch on a limb is computed by integrating estimates of the distance between sensory input and its boundaries (e.g., elbow and wrist of the forearm). As evidence of this computational mechanism, tactile localization on a limb is most precise near its boundaries and lowest in the middle. We show that the brain repurposes trilateration to localize touch on a tool. In a large sample of participants, we found that localizing touch on a tool produced the signature of trilateration, with highest precision close to the base and tip of the tool. A computational model of trilateration provided a good fit to the observed localization behavior. To further demonstrate the computational plausibility of repurposing trilateration, we implemented it in a three-layer neural network that was based on principles of probabilistic population coding. This network determined hit location in tool-centered coordinates by using a tools unique pattern of vibrations when contacting an object. Simulations demonstrated the expected signature of trilateration, in line with the behavioral patterns. Our results have important implications for how trilateration may be implemented by somatosensory neural populations. We conclude that trilateration is a fundamental spatial computation that unifies limbs and tools.",

TS are N-glycosylated, but the biological functions of their glycans has remained elusive. In this study, we investigated the influence of N-glycans on the enzymatic activity and structural stability of TconTS1, a recombinant TS from the African parasite Trypanosoma congolense. The enzyme was expressed in CHO Lec1 cells, which produce high-mannose type N-glycans similar to the TS N-glycosylation pattern in vivo. MALDI-TOF MS data revealed that up to eight putative N-glycosylation sites were glycosylated. N-glycan removal via EndoHf treatment of TconTS1 led to a decrease in substrate affinity relative to the untreated enzyme, but apparently has no impact on the conversion rate. No changes in secondary structure elements of hypoglycosylated TconTS1 were observed in circular dichroism experiments. Molecular dynamics simulations provided evidence for interactions between monosaccharide units of the highly flexible N-glycans and some conserved amino acids located at the catalytic site. These interactions led to conformational changes, possibly enhancing substrate accessibility and enzyme-substrate complex stability. The here-observed modulation of catalytic activity via N-glycans represents a so far unknown structure-function relationship potentially inherent in several members of the TS enzyme family.",

    "abstract": "Social behavior is essential for the health, survival and reproduction of animals, yet the role of astrocytes in social behavior is largely unknown. CD38 is critical for social behaviors by regulating oxytocin release from hypothalamic neurons. On the other hand, CD38 is most abundantly expressed in astrocytes especially in the postnatal cortex, and is important for astroglial development. Here, we demonstrate that astroglial CD38 plays a pivotal role in the social behavior. Selective deletion of CD38 in postnatal astrocytes, but not in adult astrocytes, specifically impaired social memory without any other behavioral abnormalities. Morphological analysis revealed reductions in spine numbers, mature spines and excitatory synapse numbers in the pyramidal neurons of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) due to deletion of astroglial CD38 in the postnatal brain. Astrocyte-conditioned medium (ACM) of CD38 KO astrocytes reduced synaptogenesis of cortical neurons by reducing extracellular SPARCL1, a synaptogenic protein. Finally, the release of SPARCL1 from astrocytes is regulated by CD38/cADPR/calcium signaling. Our data indicate that astroglial CD38 developmentally regulates social memory and neural circuit formation in the developing brain by promoting synaptogenesis through SPARCL1.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that control \"beige/brite\" thermogenic adipose tissue development may be harnessed to improve human metabolic health. To define these mechanisms, we developed a species-hybrid model in which human mesenchymal progenitor cells were used to develop white or thermogenic/beige adipose tissue in mice. The hybrid adipose tissue developed distinctive features of human adipose tissue, such as larger adipocyte size, despite its neurovascular architecture being entirely of murine origin. Thermogenic adipose tissue recruited a denser, qualitatively distinct vascular network, differing in genes mapping to circadian rhythm pathways, and denser sympathetic innervation. The enhanced thermogenic neurovascular network was associated with human adipocyte expression of THBS4, TNC, NTRK3 and SPARCL1, which enhance neurogenesis, and decreased expression of MAOA and ACHE, which control neurotransmitter tone. Systemic inhibition of MAOA, which is present in human but absent in mouse adipocytes, induced browning of human but not mouse adipose tissue, revealing the physiological relevance of this pathway. Our results reveal species-specific cell type dependencies controlling the development of thermogenic adipose tissue and point to human adipocyte MAOA as a potential target for metabolic disease therapy.",

    "abstract": "The goal of auditory attention decoding (AAD) is to determine to which speaker out of multiple competing speakers a listener is attending based on the brain signals recorded via, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG). AAD algorithms are a fundamental building block of so-called neuro-steered hearing devices that would allow identifying the speaker that should be amplified based on the brain activity. A common approach is to train a subject-specific stimulus decoder that reconstructs the amplitude envelope of the attended speech signal. However, training this decoder requires a dedicated  ground-truth EEG recording of the subject under test, during which the attended speaker is known. Furthermore, this decoder remains fixed during operation and can thus not adapt to changing conditions and situations. Therefore, we propose an online time-adaptive unsupervised stimulus reconstruction method that continuously and automatically adapts over time when new EEG and audio data are streaming in. The adaptive decoder does not require ground-truth attention labels obtained from a training session with the end-user and instead can be initialized with a generic subject-independent decoder or even completely random values. We propose two different implementations: a sliding window and recursive implementation, which we extensively validate on three independent datasets based on multiple performance metrics. We show that the proposed time-adaptive unsupervised decoder outperforms a time-invariant supervised decoder, representing an important step toward practically applicable AAD algorithms for neuro-steered hearing devices.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceRapid advances in biophotonics techniques require quantitative, model-based computational approaches to obtain functional and structural information from increasingly complex and multi-scaled anatomies. The lack of efficient tools to accurately model tissue structures and subsequently perform quantitative multi-physics modeling greatly impedes the clinical translation of these modalities.\n\nAimWhile the mesh-based Monte Carlo (MMC) method expands our capabilities in simulating complex tissues by using tetrahedral meshes, the generation of such domains often requires specialized meshing tools such as Iso2Mesh. Creating a simplified and intuitive interface for tissue anatomical modeling and optical simulations is essential towards making these advanced modeling techniques broadly accessible to the user community.\n\nApproachWe responded to the above challenge by combining the powerful, open-source 3-D modeling software, Blender, with state-of-the-art 3-D mesh generation and MC simulation tools, utilizing the interactive graphical user interface (GUI) in Blender as the front-end to allow users to create complex tissue mesh models, and subsequently launch MMC light simulations.\n\nResultsHere we present a tutorial to our newly developed Python-based Blender add-on - BlenderPhotonics - to interface with Iso2Mesh and MMC, allowing users to create, configure and refine complex simulation domains and run hardware-accelerated 3-D light simulations with only a few clicks. We provide a comprehensive introduction to this new tool and walk readers through 5 examples, ranging from simple shapes to sophisticated realistic tissue models.\n\nConclusionBlenderPhotonics is user-friendly and open-source, leveraging the vastly rich ecosystem of Blender.

However, these technologies suffer from substantial noise, among which ambient signals present in the cell suspension may be the predominant source. Current models to address this issue are highly technology-specific and relatively scRNAseq-centric. while a universal model to describe the noise across these technologies may reveal this common source, improving the denoising accuracy. To this end, we explicitly examined these unexpected signals in multiple datasets across droplet-based technologies, summarised a predictable pattern, and developed single-cell Ambient Remover (scAR) - a hypothesis-driven machine learning model to predict and remove ambient signals (including mRNA counts, protein counts, and sgRNA counts) at the molecular level. We benchmarked scAR on three technologies - single-cell CRISPR screens, CITE-seq, and scRNAseq along with the state-of-the-art single-technology-specific approaches. scAR showed high denoising accuracy for each type of dataset.",

Many ERV-derived genes are reported in the therians that are involved in placental development. However, the contribution of the ERV-derived genes in monotremes, which are oviparous mammals, remains to be uncovered. Here, we conducted a comprehensive search for possible ERV-derived genes in platypus and echidna genomes and identified three reverse transcriptase-like genes named RTOM1, 2, and 3. They were found to be clustered in the GRIP2 intron. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that RTOM1, 2, and 3 are strongly conserved between these species, and they were generated by tandem duplications before the divergence of platypus and echidna. The RTOM transcripts were specifically expressed in the testis, suggesting the physiological importance of RTOM genes.

Locomotion is a highly variable behavior, and influenced by subject characteristics (e.g. body mass, size, age, disease). We assemble a set of methods from different scientific disciplines, composing an automatic, high through-put workflow which can disentangle behavioral complexity and generate precise individual indicators of non-normal behavior for application in diagnostics and research. For this study, piglets (Sus domesticus) were filmed from lateral perspective during their first ten hours of life, an age at which maturation is quick and body mass and size have major consequences for survival. We then apply deep learning methods for point digitization, calculate joint angle profiles, and apply information-preserving transformations to retrieve a multivariate kinematic data set. We train probabilistic models to infer subject characteristics from kinematics. Model accuracy is validated for strides from piglets of normal birth weight (i.e. the category it was trained on), but the models infer the body mass and size of low birth weight piglets (which were left out of training, out-of-sample inference) to be \"normal\". The age of some (but not all) low birth weight individuals is underestimated, indicating developmental delay. Such individuals could be identified automatically, inspected, and treated accordingly. This workflow has potential for automatic, precise screening in livestock management.",

To identify the PK isoforms involved, we generated mice lacking {beta}-cell PKm1, PKm2, and mitochondrial PEP carboxykinase (PCK2) that generates mitochondrial PEP. Glucose metabolism generates both glycolytic and mitochondrially-derived PEP, which triggers KATP closure through local PKm1 and PKm2 signaling at the plasma membrane. Amino acids, which generate mitochondrial PEP without producing glycolytic fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to allosterically activate PKm2, signal through PKm1 to raise ATP/ADP, close KATP channels, and stimulate insulin secretion. Raising cytosolic ATP/ADP with amino acids is insufficient to close KATP channels in the absence of PK activity or PCK2, indicating that KATP channels are regulated by mitochondrially-derived PEP that provides ATP via plasma membrane-associated PK, but not via mitochondrially-derived ATP. Following membrane depolarization, the PEP cycle is also involved in an \"off-switch\" that facilitates KATP channel reopening and Ca2+ extrusion, as shown by PK activation experiments and {beta}-cell PCK2 deletion that prolonged Ca2+ oscillations and increased insulin secretion. In conclusion, the differential response of PKm1 and PKm2 to the glycolytic and mitochondrial sources of PEP influences the {beta}-cell nutrient response, and controls the oscillatory cycle regulating insulin secretion.",

    "abstract": "Hyaluronan (HA) is a major component of peri- and extra-cellular matrices and plays important roles in many biological processes such as cell adhesion, proliferation and migration. The abundance, size distribution and presentation of HA dictate its biological effects and are also useful indicators of pathologies and disease progression. Methods to assess the molecular mass of free-floating HA and other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) are well established. In many biological and technological settings, however, GAGs are displayed on surfaces, and methods to obtain the size of surface-attached GAGs are lacking. Here, we present a method to size HA that is end-attached to surfaces. The method is based on the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) and exploits that the softness and thickness of films of grafted HA increase with HA size. These two quantities are sensitively reflected by the ratio of the dissipation shift ({Delta}D) and the negative frequency shift (-{Delta}f) measured by QCM-D upon the formation of HA films. Using a series of size-defined HA preparations, ranging in size from [~]2 kDa tetrasaccharides to [~]1 MDa polysaccharides, we establish a monotonic yet non-linear standard curve of the {Delta}D/-{Delta}f ratio as a function of HA size, which reflects the distinct conformations adopted by grafted HA chains depending on their size and surface coverage. We demonstrate that the standard curve can be used to determine the mean size of HA, as well as other GAGs, such as chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, of preparations of previously unknown size in the range from 1 to 500 kDa, with a resolution of better than 10%. For polydisperse samples, our analysis shows that the process of surface-grafting preferentially selects smaller GAG chains, and thus reduces the average size of GAGs that are immobilised on surfaces comparative to the original solution sample. Our results establish a quantitative method to size HA and other GAGs grafted on surfaces, and also highlight the importance of sizing GAGs directly on surfaces. The method should be useful for the development and quality control of GAG-based surface coatings in a wide range of research areas, from molecular interaction analysis to biomaterials coatings.",

Our systematic study reveals conserved residues critical for protonation steps and their regulation, and how sequential protonation of these proton switches coordinates the conformational transitions in the context of a noncanonical ligand-dependent alternating access. A conserved periplasmic salt bridge (Asp60TM2:Arg289TM7) keeps the transporter in a closed conformation, while proton-dependent conformational dynamics are significantly enhanced on the periplasmic side, providing a pathway for ligand exchange.

    "abstract": "Over two decades ago, scientists developed a push-pull intercropping strategy that received critical acclaim for synergizing food security with ecosystem resilience in smallholder farming. The strategy suppresses Lepidopteran pests in maize through a combination of a repellent intercrop (push), commonly Desmodium spp., and an attractive, dead-end border crop (pull). Key is the intercrops constitutive release of volatiles that repel herbivores. Surprisingly, however, we found that Desmodium does not constitutively release volatiles, and only minimally upon herbivory. Further, in oviposition choice settings, Spodoptera frugiperda, a devastating invasive pest, was not repelled by Desmodium volatiles. In search of an alternative mechanism, we found that neonate larvae strongly preferred Desmodium over maize. However, their development stagnated and none survived. In addition, larvae were frequently seen impaled and immobilized by the dense network of silica-fortified, non-glandular trichomes. Thus, entirely different from repelling adult moths, Desmodium intercepts and decimates dispersing offspring. As a hallmark of sustainable pest control, maize-Desmodium intercropping has inspired countless efforts trying to emulate a stimulo-deterrent diversion in other cropping systems. However, detailed knowledge of the actual mechanisms is required to rationally improve the strategy, and translate the concept into other cropping systems.",

    "abstract": "AlphaFold2 has revolutionized protein structure prediction by leveraging sequence information to rapidly model protein folds with atomic-level accuracy. Nevertheless, previous work has shown that these predictions tend to be inaccurate for structurally heterogeneous proteins. To systematically assess factors that contribute to this inaccuracy, we tested AlphaFold2s performance on 98 fold-switching proteins, which assume at least two distinct-yet-stable secondary and tertiary structures. Topological similarities were quantified between five predicted and two experimentally determined structures of each fold-switching protein. Overall, 94% of AlphaFold2 predictions captured one experimentally determined conformation but not the other. Despite these biased results, AlphaFold2s estimated confidences were moderate-to-high for 74% of fold-switching residues, a result that contrasts with overall low confidences for intrinsically disordered proteins, which are also structurally heterogeneous. To investigate factors contributing to this disparity, we quantified sequence variation within the multiple sequence alignments used to generate AlphaFold2s predictions of fold-switching and intrinsically disordered proteins. Unlike intrinsically disordered regions, whose sequence alignments show low conservation, fold-switching regions had conservation rates statistically similar to canonical single-fold proteins. Furthermore, intrinsically disordered regions had systematically lower prediction confidences than either fold-switching or single-fold proteins, regardless of sequence conservation. AlphaFold2s high prediction confidences for one fold-switching conformation corroborate previous work showing that machine-learning-based structure predictors fail to capture other fundamental biophysical features of proteins such as their folding pathways. Our results emphasize the need to look at protein structure as an ensemble and suggest that systematic examination of fold-switching sequences may reveal propensities for multiple stable secondary and tertiary structures.",

    "abstract": "Long read sequencing technology is becoming increasingly popular for Precision Medicine applications like Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and microbial abundance estimation. Minimap2 is the state-of-the-art aligner and mapper used by the leading long read sequencing technologies, today. However, Minimap2 on CPUs is very slow for long noisy reads. [~]60-70% of the run-time on a CPU comes from the highly sequential chaining step in Minimap2. On the other hand, most Point-of-Care computational workflows in long read sequencing use Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). We present minimap2-accelerated (mm2-ax), a heterogeneous design for sequence mapping and alignment where minimap2s compute intensive chaining step is sped up on the GPU and demonstrate its time and cost benefits.\n\nWe extract better intra-read parallelism from chaining without loosing mapping accuracy by forward transforming Minimap2s chaining algorithm. Moreover, we better utilize the high memory available on modern cloud instances apart from better workload balancing, data locality and minimal branch divergence on the GPU. We show mm2-ax on an NVIDIA A100 GPU improves the chaining step with 5.41 - 2.57X speedup and 4.07 - 1.93X speedup : costup over the fastest version of Minimap2, mm2-fast, benchmarked on a Google Cloud Platform instance of 30 SIMD cores.",

    "abstract": "Meditation has been practised for millennia but the neuroscientific understanding of the dynamics is still lacking. Sudarshan Kriya Yoga (SKY) is an evidence based breathing based meditation technique that utilizes rhythmic breathing to induce a deep state of relaxation and calm. Multiple studies have found benefits of the SKY technique from genetic, physiological, psychological to behaviour levels. We collected Electroencephalographic (EEG) data in 43 subjects who underwent the SKY technique and analysed the brain rhythms at different stages of the technique namely preparatory breathing (Pranayama), rhythmic breathing (Kriya) and meditation (Yoga Nidra) using newly developed methods to analyse periodic and aperiodic components. Alpha waves amplitude in the parieto-occipital region decreased as the rhythmic breathing progressed and dropped sharply during the meditation period. Theta amplitudes and peak frequency increased in the centro-frontal region during the rhythmic breathing period but were marked by sustained low theta waves during the meditation period. The delta wave amplitude was not affected by breathing but both delta band power and peak frequency increased during the meditation period in the centro-frontal region. We also saw a decrease in the 1/f aperiodic signal across the brain during the meditation period suggesting a modification of excitation-inhibition balance. We see an overall slowing down of brain oscillations from alpha to theta to delta as the meditation progressed. The paper studies in depth the transitional dynamics of the SKY technique analysing the alpha, theta, delta waves and aperiodic signals and demonstrates that each phase in a breathing based meditation has a unique electrophysiological signature.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies identified non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) with unknown function that are responsible for major fitness changes in yeast. To understand ncRNA interplay and aid their functional assignment, the synthetic genetic array (SGA) methodology was employed to create >15,000 double mutants and to score their epistasis in different environments. Unlike the protein network, ncRNAs mostly displayed positive epistasis in rich medium. Interestingly, the negative interactions significantly increased under stressors, showing environmental-dependent functions for ncRNAs. No correlation was found between the network of ncRNAs and that of their neighbouring genes, suggesting functional independence. The U3 paralogs, SNR17A and SNR17B, share the majority of genetic interactions in rich medium as expected. For example, SUT480 interacted with both paralogs and its function was linked to 18S rRNA processing. However, under stressors, a large number of unique epistatic interactions were observed, supporting the notion that SNR17A and SNR17B have diverged and sub-functionalised after genome duplication.",

    "abstract": "The problem of predicting a proteins 3D structure from its primary amino acid sequence is a longstanding challenge in structural biology. Recently, approaches like AlphaFold have achieved remarkable performance on this task by combining deep learning techniques with coevolutionary data from multiple sequence alignments of related protein sequences. The use of coevolutionary information is critical to these models accuracy, and without it their predictive performance drops considerably. In living cells, however, the 3D structure of a protein is fully determined by its primary sequence and the biophysical laws that cause it to fold into a low-energy configuration. Thus, it should be possible to predict a proteins structure from only its primary sequence by learning a highly-accurate biophysical energy function. We provide evidence that AlphaFold has learned such an energy function, and uses coevolution data to solve the global search problem of finding a low-energy conformation. We demonstrate that AlphaFolds learned potential function can be used to rank the quality of candidate protein structures with state-of-the-art accuracy, without using any coevolution data. Finally, we explore several applications of this potential function, including the prediction of protein structures without MSAs.",

We compared the utility of two co-immunoprecipitation techniques conventional co-IP and cross-linking co-IP coupled to mass spectrometry (IP-MS) that intriguingly generated valuable inventory of SNTA1 associated proteins in breast cancer cells that may or may not interact physically but contribute to shared functions in breast cancer pathology. We observed that Pierce cross-link IP kit enhanced sensivity of the analysis as it decreased the number of background proteins with a remarkable increase in identified list of proteins. We have also observed that different approaches are able to consistently detect the same signaling outcome as observed by Gene Ontology. Identification of interacting partners of SNTA1 in breast cancer cell lines may depict the possible signaling mechanism of this protein in molecular pathogenesis of breast cancer and its possible use as a therapeutic target.",

All bacterial sequences were de novo assembled using Unicycler before extraction of plasmids. Assembly graphs were submitted to Gplas+plasflow for plasmid prediction. The predicted plasmid components were validated using PlasmidFinder.\n\nA total of 159 (56.2%) out of 283 bacterial isolates were found to carry plasmids, with E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus being the most prevalent plasmid carriers. A total of 27 (87.1%) combined plasmids were found to carry both resistance and virulence genes compared to 4 (12.9%) single plasmids. No statistically significant correlation was found between the number of antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes in plasmids (r =-0.25, p > 0.05).

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging-based brain-age estimation via machine learning has emerged as an important new approach for studying brain aging. The difference between ones estimated brain age and chronological age, the brain age gap (BAG), has been proposed as an Alzheimers Disease (AD) biomarker. However, most past studies on the BAG have been cross-sectional. Identifying how an individuals BAG temporal pattern changes over time would enable improved prediction of clinical outcome based on neurophysiological changes and better understanding of AD progression. To fill this gap, our study conducted predictive modeling using large neuroimaging data with up to 8 years of follow-up to examine the temporal patterns of the BAGs trajectory and how it varies by subject-level characteristics and disease status. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort to take a longitudinal approach to investigate the pattern and rate of change in BAG over time in individuals who progress from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to clinical AD. Combining multimodal imaging data in a support vector regression model to estimate brain age yielded improved performance than single modality. Multilevel modeling results showed the BAG followed a linear increasing trajectory with a significantly faster rate in individuals with MCI who progressed to AD compared to cognitively normal or MCI individuals who did not progress. The dynamic changes in the BAG during AD progression were further moderated by gender and APO{varepsilon}4 carriership. Findings demonstrate the BAG as a potential biomarker for understanding individual specific temporal patterns related to AD progression.",

In most cases, the repair or replacement of tissues is fueled by tissue-specific or lineage-restricted stem cells that proliferate in response to local injury and apoptosis4-11. However, in organisms that regenerate using abundant adult pluripotent stem cells, the stem cell niches that support tissue repair have not been identified or characterized. Since these adult pluripotent stem cells are often more widely distributed and plentiful than lineage-restricted stem cells of other organisms, defining their microenvironments may uncover alternative forms of stem cell regulation12-14. Here we used unbiased spatial transcriptomics to define the cellular and molecular environments that support pluripotency in the highly regenerative freshwater planarian Schmidtea mediterranea. We determined that stem cells associate with a diverse collection of differentiated cell types, and these associations are highly dynamic during regeneration. We explored associations with two distinct cell types: secretory cells we term  hecatonoblasts, and intestinal cells. While both cell types regulate stem cell proliferation, their spatial relationships to stem cells defy the concept of a single regenerative niche. Thus, the planarian stem cell pool is likely maintained by a dynamic collection of distinct microenvironments that cooperatively power whole-body regeneration.",

Here, we investigate systematically the spatial distribution and expression of mRNA at single molecule sensitivity and their corresponding proteins of 200 YFP trap protein trap lines across the intact Drosophila nervous system. 98% of the genes studied showed discordance between the distribution of mRNA and the proteins they encode in at least one region of the nervous system. These data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is very common, helping to explain the complexity of the nervous system. We also discovered that 68.5% of these genes have transcripts present at the periphery of neurons, with 9.5% at the glial periphery. Peripheral transcripts include many potential new regulators of neurons, glia and their interactions. Our approach is applicable to most genes and tissues and includes powerful novel data annotation and visualisation tools for post-transcriptional regulation.\n\nBrief outlineA novel high resolution and sensitive approach to systematically co-visualise the distribution of mRNAs and proteins in the intact nervous system reveals that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression is very common.

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients experience variable symptoms dependent on the presence of an emphysematous versus a chronic bronchitis phenotype. Both presentations can be associated with lung tissue and systemic hypoxia, at its most severe leading to Cor pulmonale. Despite this, minimal attention has been given to the effects of hypoxia at the cellular disease level.\n\nWe isolated and cultured progenitor cells from the distal lung tissue of a 64 year-old, male, emphysematous donor in ambient (21%) and hypoxic (2%) oxygen conditions. Proliferative capacity was determined on collagen coated culture plastic and growth-inactivated 3T3-J2 co-cultures. Epithelial (E-cadherin and pan-cytokeratin) and progenitor (TP63, cytokeratin 5) marker expression were examined. Expanded cells were differentiated at air-liquid interface and ciliated, mucous producing, and club cell populations identified.\n\nIsolated cells were positive for the epithelial, pan-cytokeratin and E-cadherin, and progenitor, TP63 and cytokeratin 5, cell markers at isolation and again at passage 5. Passage 5 expanded cells in hypoxia had increased the proportion of TP63 expressing cells by 10% from 51.6 {+/-} 1.2% to 62.6 {+/-} 2.3% (p [&le;] 0.01). Proliferative capacity was greater in 3T3J2 co-cultured cells overall and in 2% oxygen this supported the emergence of a proliferation unrestricted population with a limited differentiation capacity. Cells expanded on collagen I in either oxygen underwent differentiation having been expanded with the production of ciliated cells positive for {beta}IV tubulin, and mucin 5ac, mucin 5b and CC10 positive secretory cells. Epithelial barrier formation was reduced significantly (p [&le;] 0.0001) in hypoxia-expanded cells compared to normoxia. qRT-PCR showed higher expression of mucins in 2% expanded cells, significantly so with MUC5B (P [&le;] 0.05) although mucin protein secretion was greater in 21% expanded cells.\n\nConcomitantly these results demonstrate that hypoxia promotes a proliferative phenotype while reducing the overall differentiation capacity of the cells. Further, the retained differentiation potential becomes skewed to a more secretory phenotype demonstrating that hypoxia may be contributing to disease symptom and severity in COPD patients.",

    "abstract": "Enzymatic DNA modifications like methylcytosine (5mdC), methyladenine (N6mdA), or hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmdC) are key for chromatin function, gene expression regulation, and antiviral defense, but they remain understudied in non-model organisms. We established a mass spectrometric method for the sensitive and accurate quantification of enzymatic DNA modifications, and analyzed 85 bacterial genomes, 19 plant samples, 41 tissues from 12 animal species, 6 yeast species, and two archaeal species. We report no or only very low concentrations of DNA modifications in yeast and insects, but find DNA modifications universal to both bacteria and higher eukaryotes. Specifically for prokaryotes, our dataset indicates that evolutionary relationships and host-pathogen interactions, but not the ecological niche in general, select for a similar degree of DNA modification. In higher eukaryotes, largest concentration differences between tissues are detected for 5hmdC. Our dataset further reveals unique biological cases that warrant attention in the study of DNA modifications. For instance, while our data shows that most species contain just one dominating DNA modification, we detect all dominianting DNA modifications (5mdC, N6mdA, and 5hmdC) to exist in parallel in Raphanus sativus. Other plant species, like onion, sunflower, or the grass big bluestem, can have more than 35% of cytosines methylated. Finally, 5hmdC, so far mostly studied in the vertebrate central nervous system, was identified to reach a concentration of up to 8% of all cytosines in the Oman garra brain, and was also detected in several plants, like Lepidium sativum. The present study underscores the exploitation of biological diversity for studying DNA modifications.",

    "abstract": "The endeavour to understand human cognition has largely relied upon investigation of task-related brain activity. However, resting-state brain activity can also offer insights into individual information processing and performance capabilities. Previous research has identified electroencephalographic resting-state characteristics (most prominently: the individual alpha frequency; IAF) that predict cognitive function. However, it has largely overlooked a second component of electrophysiological signals: aperiodic 1/f activity. The current study examined how both oscillatory and aperiodic resting-state EEG measures, alongside traditional cognitive tests, can predict performance in a dynamic and complex, semi-naturalistic cognitive task. Participants resting-state EEG was recorded prior to engaging in a Target Motion Analysis (TMA) task in a simulated submarine control room environment (CRUSE), which required participants to integrate dynamically changing information over time. We demonstrated that the relationship between IAF and cognitive performance extends from simple cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span) to complex, dynamic measures of information processing. Further, our results showed that individual 1/f parameters (slope and intercept) differentially predicted performance across practice and testing sessions, whereby flatter slopes were associated with improved performance during learning, while higher intercepts were linked to better performance during testing. In addition to the EEG predictors, we demonstrate a link between cognitive skills most closely related to the TMA task (i.e., spatial imagery) and subsequent performance. Overall, the current study highlights (1) how resting-state metrics - both oscillatory and aperiodic - have the potential to index higher-order cognitive capacity, while (2) emphasising the importance of examining these electrophysiological components within more dynamic settings and over time.",

    "abstract": "The ventral hippocampus (vH) plays a crucial role in anxiety-related behaviour and vH neurons increase their firing when animals explore anxiogenic environments. However, if and how such neuronal activity induces or restricts the exploration of an anxiogenic location remains unexplained. Here, we developed a novel behavioural paradigm to motivate rats to explore an anxiogenic area. Rats ran along an elevated linear maze with protective sidewalls, which were subsequently removed in parts of the track to introduce an anxiogenic location. We recorded neuronal action potentials during task performance and found that vH neurons exhibited remapping of activity, overrepresenting anxiogenic locations. Direction-dependent firing was homogenised by the anxiogenic experience. We further showed that the activity of vH neurons predicted the extent of exploration of the anxiogenic location. Our data suggest that anxiety-related firing does not solely depend on the exploration of anxiogenic environments, but also on intentions to explore them.",

    "abstract": "While it is now broadly accepted that Homo sapiens originated within Africa, considerable uncertainty surrounds specific models of divergence and migration across the continent. Progress is hampered by a paucity of fossil and genomic data, as well as variability in prior divergence time estimates. Here we use linkage disequilibrium and diversity-based statistics, optimized for rapid, complex demographic inference to discriminate among such models. We infer detailed demographic models for populations across Africa, including representatives from eastern and western groups, as well as 44 newly whole-genome sequenced individuals from the Nama (Khoe-San). Despite the complexity of African population history, contemporary population structure dates back to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5. The earliest population divergence among contemporary populations occurs 120-135ka, between the Khoe-San and other groups. Prior to the divergence of contemporary African groups, we infer long-lasting structure between two or more weakly differentiated ancestral Homo populations connected by gene flow over hundreds of thousands of years (i.e. a weakly structured stem). We find that weakly structured stem models provide more likely explanations of polymorphism that had previously been attributed to contributions from archaic hominins in Africa. In contrast to models with archaic introgression, we predict that fossil remains from coexisting ancestral populations should be morphologically similar. Despite genetic similarity between these populations, an inferred 1-4% of genetic differentiation among contemporary human populations can be attributed to genetic drift between stem populations. We show that model misspecification explains variation in previous divergence time estimates and argue that studying a suite of models is key to robust inferences about deep history.",

    "abstract": "We previously conducted genetic analyses, and identified semaphorin signaling as associating with coronary artery disease. Of the semaphorins, human vascular expression profiling suggested SEMA3F as potentially linked to atherogenesis. In hyperlipidemic mice, SEMA3F reduced aortic lesion area, and increased fibrous cap endothelial content, leading to plaque stability. In a disturbed-flow-mediated endothelial dysfunction-driven lesion model, the absence of Sema3f increased plaques, further implicating SEMA3F in endothelial function. Monocyte adhesion to Sema3f-/- vascular endothelial cells (VECs) was elevated, driven by increased PI3K activity, leading to increased NF-{kappa}B-mediated elevation in VCAM1 and ICAM1 expression, suggesting that SEMA3F reduces VEC PI3K activity. Increased permeability led to increased monocyte transmigration through Sema3f-/- VECs, and mTOR phosphorylation was decreased, suppressing VE-cadherin expression and cell-cell adherens junction stability. Actomyosin fiber formation was decreased in Sema3f-/- VECs, which was reversed by PI3K inhibition, further implicating SEMA3F in adherens junction stability. In Sema3f-/- vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), active PI3K was also increased. PI3K facilitates VSMC proliferation, migration, and pro-atherogenic phenotype switching, which were reduced by SEMA3F. In agreement, in a model of VSMC proliferation and migration-induced neointima formation, SEMA3F reduced plaques. Semaphorin3F is causally atheroprotective. SEMA3Fs suppression of VEC and VSMC PI3K activation may contribute to its atheroprotection.",

In this study, hyperspectral image was used to develop more robust leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) prediction model based on different datasets to finally analyze the response of LCC to glyphosate-stress. Chlorophyll a fluorescence (ChlF) was used to dynamically monitor the photosynthetic physiological response of transgenic glyphosate-resistant and wild glyphosate-sensitive maize seedlings, and applying chemometrics methods to extract time-series features to screen resistant cultivars. Both the proposed two transfer strategies achieved the best prediction of LCC with a coefficient of determination value of 0.84, and relative root mean square error of 4.03 for the prediction set. Based on the predicted LCC and ChlF data, we found the antioxidant system of glyphosate-sensitive plants is too fragile to protect themselves from the damage, while glyphosate-resistant plants could overcome it by activating more powerful antioxidant system. {varphi}E0, VJ, {psi}E0, and M0 could be used to indicate damage caused by glyphosate to differentiate resistant cultivars.

    "abstract": "At mature CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses, alternatively spliced SS4+ variants of neurexin-1 (Nrxn1SS4+) and neurexin-3 (Nrxn3SS4+) enhance NMDA- and suppress AMPA-receptors, respectively. Both Nrxn1SS4+ and Nrxn3SS4+ act by binding to secreted cerebellin-2 (Cbln2) that in turn activates postsynaptic GluD1, which is homologous to AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Whether neurexin-Cbln2-GluD1 signaling complexes have additional functions in synapse formation besides regulating NMDA- and AMPA-receptors, and whether they perform similar roles at other synapses, remains unknown. Using constitutive Cbln2 deletions, we here demonstrate that at CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses, Cbln2 performs no additional developmental functions besides regulating AMPA- and NMDA-receptors. Moreover, we show that low-level expression of Cbln1, which is functionally redundant with Cbln2, does not compensate for a synapse-formation function of Cbln2 at CA1[-&gt;]subiculum synapses. In exploring the generality of these findings, we found that in prefrontal cortex, Nrxn1SS4+-Cbln2 signaling selectively regulates NMDA-receptors, whereas Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln2 signaling has no apparent role. In contrast, in the cerebellum Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln1 signaling regulates AMPA-receptors, whereas now Nrxn1SS4+-Cbln1 signaling has no manifest effect. Thus, Nrxn1SS4+- and Nrxn3SS4+-Cbln1/2 signaling complexes generally control NMDA- and AMPA-receptors in different synapses without regulating synapse formation, but these signaling complexes are differentially active in diverse neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Transfer RNA variants increase the frequency of mistranslation, the mis-incorporation of an amino acid not specified by the \"standard\" genetic code, to frequencies approaching 10% in yeast and bacteria. Cells cope with these variants by having multiple copies of each tRNA isodecoder and through pathways that deal with proteotoxic stress. In this study, we define the genetic interactions of the gene encoding tRNASerUGG,G26A, which mistranslates serine at proline codons. Using a collection of yeast temperature sensitive alleles, we identify negative synthetic genetic interactions between the mistranslating tRNA and 109 alleles representing 91 genes, with nearly half of the genes having roles in RNA processing or protein folding and turnover. By regulating tRNA expression, we then compare the strength of the negative genetic interaction for a subset of identified alleles under differing amounts of mistranslation. The frequency of mistranslation correlated with impact on cell growth for all strains analyzed; however, there were notable differences in the extent of the synthetic interaction at different frequencies of mistranslation depending on the genetic background. For many of the strains the extent of the negative interaction with tRNASerUGG,G26A was proportional to the frequency of mistranslation or only observed at intermediate or high frequencies. For others the synthetic interaction was approximately equivalent at all frequencies of mistranslation. As humans contain similar mistranslating tRNAs these results are important when analyzing the impact of tRNA variants on disease, where both the individuals genetic background and the expression of the mistranslating tRNA variant need to be considered.",

Their dysfunction is linked to numerous human pathologies that often manifest in a tissue-specific manner. Accordingly, mitochondrial fitness depends on versatile proteomes specialized to meet diverse tissue-specific requirements. Furthermore, increasing evidence suggests that phosphorylation may also play an important role in regulating tissue-specific mitochondrial functions and pathophysiology. We hypothesized that recent advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics would now enable in-depth measurement to quantitatively profile mitochondrial proteomes along with their matching phosphoproteomes across tissues. We isolated mitochondria from mouse heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, kidney, liver, brain, and spleen by differential centrifugation followed by separation on Percoll gradients and high-resolution MS analysis of the proteomes and phosphoproteomes. This in-depth map substantially quantifies known and predicted mitochondrial proteins and provides a resource of core and tissue modulated mitochondrial proteins (mitophos.de). We also uncover tissue-specific repertoires of dozens of kinases and phosphatases. Predicting kinase substrate associations for different mitochondrial compartments indicates tissue-specific regulation at the phosphoproteome level. Illustrating the functional value of our resource, we reproduce mitochondrial phosphorylation events on DRP1 responsible for its mitochondrial recruitment and fission initiation and describe phosphorylation clusters on MIGA2 linked to mitochondrial fusion.",

    "abstract": "Resident macrophages are distributed across all tissues and are highly heterogeneous as a consequence of adaptation to different tissue-specific environments. The resident macrophages of the sensory ganglia (sensory neuron-associated macrophages, sNAMs) are in close contact with the cell body of primary sensory neurons and might play physiological and pathophysiological roles. After peripheral nerve injury, there is an increase in the population of macrophages in the sensory ganglia which have been involved in different conditions, especially in neuropathic pain development and nerve regeneration. However, it is still under debate whether macrophages accumulation in the sensor ganglia after peripheral nerve injury is due to the local proliferation of resident macrophages or as a result of blood monocytes infiltration. Here, we confirmed that the number of macrophages increased in the DRGs after spared nerve injury (SNI) model in mice. By using different approaches, we found that the increase in the number of macrophages in the DRGs after SNI is mainly in consequence of the proliferation of resident CX3CR1+ macrophages but not due to infiltration of CCR2+ blood monocytes. These proliferating macrophages are the source of the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-1b. In addition, we found that CX3CR1 signaling is involved in the sNAMs proliferation after peripheral nerve injury. In summary, these results indicated that peripheral nerve injury leads to sNAMs proliferation in the sensory ganglia in a CX3CR1-dependent manner. In conclusion, sNAMs proliferation could be modulated to change pathophysiological conditions such as chronic neuropathic pain and/or nerve regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Neurogenesis is the generation of neurons from stem cells, a process that is regulated by SoxB transcription factors (TFs) in many animals. Although the roles of these TFs are well understood in bilaterians, how their neural function evolved is unclear. Here, we use Hydractinia symbiolongicarpus, a member of the early-branching phylum Cnidaria, to provide insight into this question. Using a combination of mRNA in situ hybridization, transgenesis, gene knockdown, transcriptomics, and in-vivo imaging, we provide a comprehensive molecular and cellular analysis of neurogenesis during embryogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration in this animal. We show that SoxB genes act sequentially. Stem cells expressing Piwi1 and Soxb1, which have a broad developmental potential, become neural progenitors that express Soxb2 before differentiating into mature neural cells. Knockdown of SoxB genes resulted in complex defects in embryonic neurogenesis. Hydractinia neural cells differentiate while migrating from the aboral to the oral end of the animal, but it is unclear whether migration per se or exposure to different microenvironments is the main driver of their fate determination. Our data constitute a rich resource for studies aiming at addressing this question, which is at the heart of understanding neurological disorders in all animals, including humans.",

    "abstract": "Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to contain the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic drastically reduced human-to-human interactions, decreasing the circulation of other respiratory viruses as well. As a consequence, influenza virus circulation - normally responsible for 3-5 million hospitalizations per year globally - was significantly reduced. With downscaling the NPI countermeasures, there is a concern for increased influenza disease, particularly in individuals suffering from post-acute effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To investigate this possibility, we performed a sequential influenza H1N1 infection 4 weeks after an initial SARS-CoV-2 infection in the ferret model. Upon H1N1 infection, ferrets that were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 showed an increased tendency to develop clinical symptoms compared to the control H1N1 infected animals. Histopathological analysis indicated only a slight increase for type II pneumocyte hyperplasia and bronchitis. The effects of the sequential infection thus appeared minor. However, ferrets were infected with B.1.351-SARS-CoV-2, the beta variant of concern, which replicated poorly in our model. The histopathology of the respiratory organs was mostly resolved 4 weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection, with only reminiscent histopathological features in the upper respiratory tract. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and humoral responses were observed, confirming an established infection. Thus, there may likely be a SARS-CoV-2 variant-dependent effect on the severity of disease upon a sequential influenza infection as we observed mild effects upon a mild infection. It, however, remains to be determined what the impact is of more virulent SARS-CoV-2 variants.\n\nImportanceDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of face masks, social distancing and isolation were not only effective in decreasing the circulation of SARS-CoV-2, but also in reducing other respiratory viruses such as influenza. With less restrictions, influenza is slowly returning. In the meantime, people still suffering from long-COVID, could be more vulnerable to an influenza virus infection and develop more severe influenza disease. This study provides directions to the effect of a previous SARS-CoV-2 exposure on influenza disease severity in the ferret model. This model is highly valuable to test sequential infections under controlled settings for translation to humans. We could not induce clear long-term COVID-19 effects as SARS-CoV-2 infection in ferrets was mild. However, we still observed a slight increase in influenza disease severity compared to ferrets that had not encountered SARS-CoV-2 before. It may therefore be advisable to include long-COVID patients as a risk group for influenza vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the involvement of promoter DNA methylation changes in the development of breast cancer may be highly informative for designing more effective therapeutic treatments. We recently characterized the Sperm Associated Antigen 6 (SPAG6) gene, encoding a flagellar motility protein, as a potential DNA methylation biomarker for blood-based early breast cancer detection. Here we present the first study to evaluate the functional role of SPAG6 in human breast cancer. In silico analysis of the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip and Illumina HiSeq data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was performed in both normal (n=114) and breast cancer patient tissues (n=1104) to determine SPAG6 DNA methylation and expression. Stable SPAG6 overexpressing cancer models for in vitro analysis were obtained by lentivirus-mediated gene delivery in T-47D, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 breast cancer cells. Subsequently stable mock and SPAG6 cell lines were compared in cellular assays. In addition, involvement of SPAG6 in EMT was analysed by qPCR and immunolabeling experiments. All major molecular subtypes of breast cancer (luminal A, luminal B, basal-type, HER2-enriched) revealed a tumor-specific increased SPAG6 promoter hypermethylation that correlated with strong reduction in SPAG6 mRNA expression. Interestingly, a small group of luminal breast tumors exhibited SPAG6 mRNA overexpression compared to normal breast tissue. SPAG6 overexpression caused a significant reduction (p<0.05) in colony formation in basal MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells. In turn, luminal T-47D cells overexpressing SPAG6 showed a significant increase in colony formation (p=0.0004) and both T-47D-and MCF-7 cells overexpressing SPAG6 exhibited a robust increase in migration speed (p<0.0001). In SPAG6-positive T-47D cells SNAIL, TWIST1 and Vimentin expression was found to be significantly upregulated, while E-Cadherin expression was supressed. SPAG6 overexpressing T47D cells showed a typical epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). This was accompanied by a nearly complete displacement of both actin and E-cadherin from cell-cell junctions. Our in vitro analyses give functional evidence that SPAG6 has a profound effect on colony formation, migration and intercellular junction composition in breast cancer cells. Our study is the first to show opposing SPAG6 effects in a single tumour entity depending on the molecular subtype. We propose that SPAG6 might be a key player for inducing the EMT program in luminal-type breast cancers, driving tumour progression and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Formins form the largest family of actin filament nucleators and elongators, involved in the assembly of diverse actin structures. Actin filament nucleation and elongation activities reside in the formin homology 1 (FH1) and FH2 domains, common to all formins. However, the rate of these reactions varies between formins by at least 20-fold. Typically, each cell expresses several distinct formins, each contributing to the assembly of one or several actin structures, raising the question of what confers each formin its specificity. Here, using the formin Fus1 in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, we systematically probed the importance of formin nucleation and elongation rates for function in vivo. Fus1 assembles the actin fusion focus, an aster-like structure of actin filaments at the contact site between gametes, necessary for the process of cell fusion to form the zygote during sexual reproduction. By constructing chimeric formins with combinations of FH1 and FH2 domains previously characterized in vitro, we establish that changes in formin nucleation and elongation rates have direct consequences on the architecture of the fusion focus, and that Fus1 native high nucleation and low elongation rates are optimal for fusion focus assembly. We further describe a point mutant in the Fus1 FH2 domain that preserves native nucleation and elongation rates in vitro but alters function in vivo, indicating an additional property of the FH2 domain. Thus, rates of actin assembly are tailored for assembly of specific actin structures.",

    "abstract": "Compartmentalization of organelles in space and time affects their functional state and enables higher order regulation of essential cellular processes. How organellar residence is maintained in a defined area of the cell remains poorly understood. In this study, we uncover a new role for intermediate filaments in the maintenance of organellar architecture and dynamics, which is executed through a functional connection between Vimentin and the ER-embedded ubiquitin ligase ring finger protein 26 (RNF26). While the ubiquitin ligase function of RNF26 promotes perinuclear positioning of endolysosomes, its catalytically inactive mutant I382R preferentially binds Vimentin through the RNF26 C-terminal tail. Loss of either RNF26 or Vimentin redistributes endolysosomes throughout the cytosol and mobilizes ER membranes from the perinuclear ER towards the periphery. Furthermore, RNF26 and Vimentin control changes in ER morphology and organelle compartmentalization during ER stress. Collectively, we define a new function for Vimentin-containing intermediate filaments as anchors of a dynamic interplay between the ER and endosomes, critical to the integrity of the perinuclear ER and corresponding perinuclear endosomal cloud during homeostatic and stress conditions.\n\nSynopsisThe perinuclear area hosts a wide variety of cellular organelles, and their interaction with the ER governs essential cellular processes. To spatiotemporally organize endosomes and ER in the perinuclear region, the ER-embedded E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF26 interacts with Vimentin to physically link the perinuclear ER membrane with the intermediate filament cytoskeleton. As a result, Vimentin ensures perinuclear RNF26 retention, which in turn controls the perinuclear location of ER membranes and endosomes, which can be affected during stressed conditions.

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination (HR), a principal cellular pathway for double-strand break (DSB) repair, is linked to changes in chromosome movement. Although increased chromosome mobility in response to a DSB has been observed in a variety of species, its precise role in HR remains controversial. Here, we find that end resection, the recruitment of recombination proteins, increased chromosome mobility, the pairing of homologs and gene conversion are temporally linked in response to a DSB. In mre11{Delta} mutant cells, which exhibit a delay in the initial processing of a DSB, chromosome mobility and all subsequent recombination events are also delayed. Overexpression of the Dna2 nuclease suppresses the mre11{Delta} delay in end resection and restores the original timing of chromosome mobility and all subsequent downstream HR events. Thus, changing the timing of chromosome mobility results in a corresponding change in essential downstream HR events, reinforcing its mechanistic role in the DNA repair process.",

NAFLD/NASH also appears to decrease MBOAT7 expression or activity independent of these polymorphisms. Thus, we hypothesized that enhancing MBOAT7 function in NASH would improve pathology.\n\nApproach & ResultsMale C57BL6/J mice were infected with adeno-associated virus 8 (AAV8) expressing MBOAT7 under control of the hepatocyte-specific thyroid hormone-binding globulin promoter, or control virus expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP). Mice were infected after NASH induction with either choline-deficient high-fat diet or Gubra Amylin NASH diet and compared to low-fat fed control mice. Both NASH diets increased liver weights, liver triglycerides, and plasma alanine and aspartate aminotransferase (ALT and AST) markers of liver injury, which were modestly yet significantly improved by MBOAT7 overexpression. However, NASH liver histology assessed by categorical scoring was not substantially improved by MBOAT7 overexpression. MBOAT7 regulates the formation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) predominantly by arachidonoylation of lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). Shotgun lipidomics of NASH GFP-control livers suggested decreased MBOAT7 activity in that LPI content was elevated, and both total and arachidonoylated-PI were reduced. Surprisingly, MBOAT7 overexpression did not rescue the content of most arachidonoylated PI species but did normalize or increase the abundance of several oleate and linoleate-containing PI species. Free arachidonic acid was elevated but the MBOAT7 substrate arachidonoyl-CoA was found to be low in all NASH livers compared to low-fat fed mice, likely due to decreased expression of both long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSL) 1 and 4 in NASH livers compared to controls.\n\nConclusionsThese results suggest MBOAT7 overexpression fails to measurably improve NASH pathology potentially due to insufficient abundance of its arachidonoyl-CoA substrate in fatty livers.",

We describe the small molecule tricyclic pyrimidoindole JSF-2414 [8-(6- fluoro-8-(methylamino)-2-((2-methylpyrimidin-5-yl)oxy)-9H-pyrimido[4,5-b]indol-4-yl)-2- oxa-8-azaspiro[4.5]decan-3-yl)methanol], which simultaneously binds to ATP binding regions of DNA gyrase (GyrB) and topoisomerase (ParE). JSF-2414 displays potent activity against N. gonorrhoeae including drug-resistant strains. A phosphate prodrug JSF-2659 was developed to facilitate oral dosing. In two different animal models of Neisseria gonorrhoeae vaginal infection, JSF-2659 was highly efficacious in reducing microbial burdens to the limit of detection. The parent molecule also showed potent in vitro activity against high-threat Gram positive organisms, and JSF-2659 was shown in a deep tissue model of VRSA and a model of C. difficile-induced colitis to be highly efficacious and protective. JSF-2659 is a novel drug candidate against high-threat multidrug resistant organisms with low potential to develop new resistance.",

    "abstract": "Industrial biotechnology comprises the manufacturing of bulk chemicals and high-value end-products from renewable feedstocks, thus it presents a valuable aspect in the present transition from traditional-resource demanding manufacturing to sustainable solutions. The non-conventional yeast Debaryomyces hansenii encompasses halotolerant characteristics that ensures its use in industrial applications, and hence, its industrial importance. For this purpose, a comprehensive and holistic understanding of its behaviour and response to abiotic stresses is essential. Through high-throughput screening methods, using advanced robotics and automation devices, the present study enlightens intraspecies behavioural characteristics of novel D. hansenii strains in response to sodium, as well as their ability to tolerate abiotic stress in semi-controlled micro-fermentations and spot-test studies. A significantly improved performance under those abiotic stresses was observed under the presence of 1M NaCl. Moreover, a positive and summative effect on growth was also found in pH 4 and high salt content. Our results align with previous findings suggesting the halophilic (and not just halotolerant) behaviour of D. hansenii, which is now extensive to all the D. hansenii strains included in this study. Strain-specific differential responses to the presence of sodium were also observed, with some strains exerting a more notable induction by the presence of salt than the standard strain (CBS767). Furthermore, our study provides indications of the use of D. hansenii in industrial bioprocesses based on lignocellulosic biomass and non-lignocellulosic feedstocks.",

    "abstract": "The scaling of surface area and volume of cells has widespread consequences for cell physiology, growth and adaptation. While the surface area increases with volume as SA ~ V{gamma} the scaling exponent for proportional growth maintaining the shape and aspect is {gamma} ~ 2/3 or 0.66. However most well-studied cellular systems deviate from this standard exponent. At the same time, a mechanism that could predict the biological or physical basis of these scaling relations remains unclear. Here, we quantify the surface area scaling with volume of Escherichia coli cells with varying growth rates and under different conditions and find the scaling exponent varies from {gamma} ~ 0.7 to 0.9. A model of uncorrelated statistical variation of cell lengths and widths can reproduce the exponent observed in experiment. Average values of length and width on the other hand results in an impression of  ideal geometric scaling, as reported in some studies. Experimental data however suggests that E. coli cell width is strongly correlated with length and a model of saturation best explains the observations. We hypothesize this model of cell size and shape regulation could serve the function of optimizing flux of nutrients, within the constraints of the cell division machinery.",

    "abstract": "Although soil viral abundance, diversity, and potential roles in microbial community dynamics and biogeochemical cycling are beginning to be appreciated1-5, little is known about the patterns and drivers of soil viral community composition that underlie their contributions to terrestrial ecology. Here, we analyzed 43 soil viromes from a precipitation manipulation experiment in a Mediterranean grassland in California, USA. We recovered 5,315 viral population sequences (vOTUs), and viral community composition exhibited a highly significant distance-decay relationship within the 18 m long field. This pattern was recapitulated in the microheterogeneity of 130 prevalent vOTUs (detected in >=90% of the viromes), which tended to exhibit significant negative correlations between genomic similarity of their predominant allelic variants and distance. Although spatial turnover was also observed in the bacterial and archaeal communities from the same soils, the signal was dampened relative to the viromes, suggesting differences in assembly drivers at local scales for viruses and their microbial hosts and/or differences in the temporal scales captured by viromes and total DNA. Despite the overwhelming spatial signal, vOTUs responsive to a decrease in soil moisture were significantly enriched in a predicted protein-sharing subnetwork of 326 vOTUs linked to 191 known actinobacteriophages, suggesting a genomically cohesive viral response to soil moisture evocative of environmental filtering, potentially by way of actinobacterial hosts. Overall, soil viral ecological processes appear to be highly constrained in space and tightly coupled to the heterogeneous, dynamic soil environment and thus fundamentally different from those of their well-mixed and more thoroughly studied marine counterparts.",

    "abstract": "Diverse bacterial volatile compounds alter bacterial stress responses and physiology, but their contribution to population dynamics in polymicrobial communities is not well known. In this study, we showed that airborne volatile hydrogen cyanide (HCN) produced by a wide range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains leads to at-a-distance inhibition of the growth of a wide array of Staphylococcus aureus strains. We determined that low oxygen level environments not only enhance P. aeruginosa HCN production but also increase S. aureus sensitivity to HCN, which impacts P. aeruginosa-S. aureus competition in microaerobic in vitro mixed biofilms as well as in an in vitro cystic fibrosis lung sputum medium. Consistently, we demonstrated that production of HCN provides a competitive advantage to P. aeruginosa in a mouse model of airways co-infected by P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Our study therefore demonstrates that P. aeruginosa HCN contributes to local and distant airborne competition against S. aureus and potentially other HCN-sensitive bacteria in contexts relevant to cystic fibrosis and other polymicrobial infectious diseases.\n\nIMPORTANCEAirborne volatile compounds produced by bacteria are often only considered as attractive or repulsive scents, but they also directly contribute to bacterial physiology. Here we showed that volatile hydrogen cyanide (HCN) released by a wide range of Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains inhibits Staphylococcus aureus growth in low oxygen in vitro biofilms or aggregates and in vivo lung environments. These results are of pathophysiological relevance, since lungs of cystic fibrosis patients are known to present microaerophilic areas and to be commonly associated with the presence of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa in polymicrobial communities. Our study therefore provides insights into how a bacterial volatile compound can contribute to the exclusion of S. aureus and other HCN-sensitive competitors from P. aeruginosa ecological niches. It opens new perspectives for the management or monitoring of P. aeruginosa infections in lower lung airway infections and other polymicrobial disease contexts.",

In particular, scALA generated cSAGs from nanopore long-read sequencing data of SAGs by producing contiguous sequences with repeated bias reduction and assembly processes. From 12 human fecal samples, scALA generated 16 cSAGs of three specifically targeted bacterial species, Anaerostipes hadrus, Agathobacter rectalis, and Ruminococcus gnavus. A. hadrus cSAGs exhibited large, ten kbp-long, phage insertions, saccharide metabolic capacity, and frequent genomic recombination with related strains from cohabitant hosts.

    "abstract": "The adaptation mechanisms of microbial communities to natural perturbations remain relatively unexplored, particularly in extreme environments. The extremophilic communities of halite (NaCl) nodules from the hyper-arid core of the Atacama Desert are self-sustained and represent a unique opportunity to study functional adaptations and community dynamics with changing environmental conditions. We transplanted halite nodules to different sites in the desert and investigated how their taxonomic, cellular, and biochemical changes correlated with water availability, using environmental data modeling and metagenomic analyses. Salt-in strategists, mainly represented by haloarchaea, significantly increased in relative abundance at sites characterized by extreme dryness, multiple wet/dry cycles, and colder conditions. The functional analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) revealed site-specific enrichments in archaeal MAGs encoding for the uptake of various compatible solutes and for glycerol utilization. These findings suggest that opportunistic salt-in strategists took over the halite communities at the driest sites. They most likely benefited from metabolites newly released in the environment by the death of microorganisms least adapted to the new conditions. The observed changes were consistent with the need to maximize cellular bioenergetics when confronted with lower water availability and higher salinity, providing valuable information on microbial community adaptations and resilience to climate change.",

One fundamental challenge in canopy research is the limited accessibility of the ecosystem. Consequently, previous studies have relied on the application of either highly invasive methods such as chemical knockdown, or on time-consuming and expensive setups such as canopy walkways or cranes. Therefore, time- and cost-efficient, ideally minimally invasive yet comprehensive applications are required to help close this knowledge gap. High-throughput metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) collected from water, soil, or air provides a minimally invasive method for biodiversity assessment, yet its potential for canopy biodiversity monitoring has not been explored.\nC_LIO_LIHerein, we conducted metabarcoding of eDNA washed off the canopy via rainwater to explore its monitoring potential. We placed four 1 m2 rain samplers beneath the canopies of four different tree taxa prior to a major rain event, filtered eDNA from the collected rainwater, and performed cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) metabarcoding to profile the invertebrate community. Additionally, we collected and identified all specimens present in the rainwater for verification.\nC_LIO_LIWe detected 50 invertebrate species by eDNA metabarcoding, of which 43 were not physically present in the water sample, thus likely representing true canopy biodiversity signals. Furthermore, we observed distinct species occurrence patterns corresponding to the four tree taxa, suggesting that ecological patterns such as host specificity can be assessed using the method.\nC_LIO_LIIn conclusion, our study provides a proof of principle that rainwash eDNA metabarcoding offers a minimally invasive and comprehensive method for tree canopy diversity monitoring.\nC_LI",

Protein deacetylation in mitochondria is catalyzed by the enzymatic activity of the NAD+-dependent deacetylase sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), however it remains unclear whether corresponding mitochondrial acetyltransferases exist. We used a bioinformatics approach to search for mitochondrial proteins with an acetyltransferase catalytic domain, and identified a novel splice variant of ELP3 (mt-ELP3) of the elongator complex, which localizes to the mitochondrial matrix in mammalian cells. Unexpectedly, mt-ELP3 does not mediate mitochondrial protein acetylation but instead induces a post-transcriptional modification of mitochondrial-transfer RNAs (mt-tRNAs). Overexpression of mt-ELP3 leads to the protection of mt-tRNAs against the tRNA-specific RNase angiogenin, increases mitochondrial translation, and furthermore increases expression of OXPHOS complexes. This study thus identifies mt-ELP3 as a non-canonical mt-tRNA modifying enzyme.",

    "abstract": "The controlled binding of the catalytically-dead CRISPR nuclease (dCas) to DNA can be used to create complex, programmable transcriptional genetic circuits, a fundamental goal of synthetic biology. This approach, called CRISPR interference (CRISPRi), is advantageous over existing methods because the programmable nature of CRISPR proteins enables the simultaneous regulation of many different targets without crosstalk. However, such gene circuit elements are limited by 1) the sensitivity to leaky repression of CRISPRi logic gates and 2) retroactive effects owing to a shared pool of dCas proteins. By utilizing antisense RNAs (asRNAs) to sequester guide RNA transcripts, as well as CRISPRi feedback to self-regulate asRNA production, we demonstrate a mechanism that suppresses unwanted CRISPRi repression and improve logical gene circuit function in E. coli. This improvement is particularly pronounced during stationary expression when CRISPRi circuits do not achieve the expected regulatory dynamics. Further, the use of dual CRISPRi/asRNA inverters restores logical performance of layered circuits such as a double inverter. By studying circuit induction at the single cell level in microfluidic channels, we provide insight into the dynamics of antisense sequestration of gRNA and regulatory feedback on dCas-based repression and derepression. These results demonstrate how CRISPRi inverters can be improved for use in more complex genetic circuitry without sacrificing the programmability and orthogonality of dCas proteins.",

    "abstract": "Biological cells display complex internal architectures, with distinct micro environments that establish the chemical heterogeneity needed to sustain cellular functions. The continued efforts to create advanced cell mimics - artificial cells - demands strategies to construct similarly heterogeneous structures with localized functionalities. Here, we introduce a platform for constructing membrane-less artificial cells from the self-assembly of synthetic DNA nanostructures, in which internal domains can be established thanks to prescribed reaction-diffusion waves. The method, rationalized through numerical modeling, enables the formation of up to five distinct, concentric environments, in which functional moieties can be localized. As a proof-of-concept, we apply this platform to build DNA-based artificial cells in which a prototypical nucleus synthesizes fluorescent RNA aptamers, which then accumulate in a surrounding storage shell, thus demonstrating spatial segregation of functionalities reminiscent of that observed in biological cells.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation in bacteria frequently serves as a simple immune system, allowing recognition of DNA from foreign sources, such as phages or selfish genetic elements. It is not well established whether methylation also frequently serves a more general epigenetic function, modifying bacterial phenotypes in a heritable manner. To address this question, here we use Oxford Nanopore sequencing to profile DNA modification marks in three natural isolates of E. coli. We first identify the DNA sequence motifs targeted by the methyltransferases in each strain. We then quantify the frequency of methylation at each of these motifs across the genome in different growth conditions. We find that motifs in specific regions of the genome consistently exhibit high or low levels of methylation. Furthermore, we show that there are replicable and consistent differences in methylated regions across different growth conditions. This suggests that during growth, E. coli transiently differentiates into distinct methylation states that depend on the growth state, raising the possibility that measuring DNA methylation alone can be used to infer bacterial growth states without additional information such as transcriptome or proteome data. These results provide new insights into the dynamics of methylation during bacterial growth, and provide evidence of differentiated cell states, a transient analogue to what is observed in the differentiation of cell types in multicellular organisms.",

To meet clinical needs, we developed a novel AST, referred to as SERS-AST, based on the surface-enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) technology. In this study, we applied SERS-AST to eight most common pathogens causing bacteremia, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, E. faecium, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Seven different antibiotics were tested, including oxacillin, levofloxacin, vancomycin, ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, and imipenem. SERS-AST determines antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria directly from positive blood cultures based on variations in bacterial SERS signals derived from secreted purines and their derivatives. The whole process could be completed within 4 hours, and the agreement rates between SERS-AST and VITEK 2 results were 96% for Gram-positive bacteria and 97% for Gram-negative bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute, highly contagious viral disease of goats and sheep, caused by the Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV). Earlier studies suggest the involvement of diverse regulatory mechanisms in PPRV infection. Methylation at N6 of Adenosine called m6A is one such RNA modification that influences various physiological and pathological phenomena. As the lung tissue represents the primary target organ of PPRV, the present study explored the m6A changes and their functional significance in PPRV disease pathogenesis. m6A-seq analysis revealed 1289 m6A peaks to be significantly altered in PPRV infected lung in comparison to normal lung, out of which 975 m6A peaks were hypomethylated and 314 peaks were hypermethylated. Importantly, hypomethylated genes were enriched in Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-13 signaling and various processes associated with extracellular matrix organization. Further, of the 843 differentially m6A containing cellular transcripts, 282 transcripts were also found to be differentially expressed. Functional analysis revealed that these 282 transcripts are significantly enriched in signaling by Interleukins, extracellular matrix organization, cytokine signaling in the immune system, signaling by receptor tyrosine kinases, and Toll-like Receptor Cascades. We also found m6A reader HNRNPC and the core component of methyltransferase complex METTL14 to be highly upregulated than the m6A readers - HNRNPA2B1 and YTHDF1 at the transcriptome level. These findings suggest that alteration in m6A landscape following PPRV is implicated in diverse processes including the Interleukin signaling.",

Here, we survey the diversity of Lactobacillus BSHs and unravel the structural basis of their substrate preference. We show that leveraging BSH activity and specificity is an effective strategy to prevent C. difficile growth in clinically relevant CDI models. A range of non-canonical conjugated BAs is also identified, comprising unique BSH substrates that also inhibit C. difficile spore germination.

    "abstract": "Introductory ParagraphEfforts to improve liver gene therapy have focused on next-generation adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector capsids, transgene delivery, and immunomodulating drugs, such as corticosteroids, to avoid destructive T-cell responses. We conducted a detailed characterization of AAV transduction in nonhuman primate liver across multiple capsids and transgenes to better define interactions that may limit stable and efficient transgene expression. We show that the initial transduction of hepatocytes is high, but the transduction rapidly diminishes to a lower stable baseline of <1% of cells, even though ~10% of the cells retain vector DNA that is localized within the nucleus. Further characterization showed genomic vector integration at frequencies of 1/100 to 1/1,000 genomes, suggesting that one mechanism for stable expression may occur via genome integration. These studies suggest that strategies to enhance durable transgene expression by activating retained nuclear episomes or by increasing the frequency of vector integrations may improve liver directed AAV gene therapy.",

    "abstract": "Transcription must be highly controlled to regulate gene expression and development. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that influence transcription and how these are coordinated in cells to ensure normal gene expression remains rudimentary. Here, we reveal that actively transcribed CpG island-associated gene promoters recruit SET1 chromatin modifying complexes to enable gene expression. Counterintuitively, this effect is independent of SET1 complex histone modifying activity, and instead relies on the capacity of these complexes to interact with the RNA Polymerase II-binding protein, WDR82. Unexpectedly, we discover that SET1 complexes sustain gene transcription by counteracting the activity of the ZC3H4/WDR82 protein complex, which we show can pervasively terminate both genic and extragenic transcription. Therefore, we discover a new gene regulatory mechanism whereby CpG island elements nucleate a protein complex that protects genic transcription from premature termination, effectively distinguishing genic from non-genic transcription to enable gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Previous research proposed that ligament laxity is a clinical feature that can be easily overlooked in patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Relaxin and relaxin-related peptides, which have anti-fibrosis roles in the vascular and kidney system and relax the pubic symphysis during pregnancy, may contribute to ligament laxity. The goal of this research was to evaluate the role of in AIS. We found significantly increased relaxin-3 plasma in patients with AIS, as well as a significant correlation between joint hypermobility and relaxin 3 plasma levels. In a classic mouse model (C57BL/6J) of scoliosis, which was established according to the literature, showed significantly higher relaxin-3 plasma levels compared to normal group. In the relaxin-3 knockout C57BL/6J mice model the prevalence of scoliosis was significantly decreased. An in vitro experiment showed that relaxin 3 has anti-fibrotic effects on spinal ligament fibroblasts in both humans and mice by inhibiting TGF-{beta} via relaxin family peptide receptor 3 (RXFP3) and increasing expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 via the TGF-{beta}/Smad2 and MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway. Blocking RXFP3 function with R3(B1-22)R significantly decreased the prevalence of scoliosis in C57BL/6J mice. In summary, the anti-fibrotic effects of relaxin-3 and RXFP3 activation may aggravate the pathogenesis of AIS.",

Using the representative enzymes nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT), histamine N-methyltransferase (HNMT), glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT), and guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase (GAMT), we optimized high-throughput screening (HTS)-amenable assays to screen 27,574 unique small molecules against all targets.

A recent study found that TRIM7 inhibits human enteroviruses through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of viral 2BC protein by targeting the 2C moiety of 2BC protein. Here, we report the crystal structures of TRIM7 in complex with 2C, where the C-terminal region of 2C is inserted into a positively charged groove of the TRIM7 PRY-SPRY domain. Structure-guided biochemical studies revealed the C-terminus glutamine residue of 2C as the primary determinant for TRIM7 binding. Such a glutamine-end motif binding mechanism can be successfully extended to other substrates of TRIM7. More importantly, leveraged by this finding, we were able to identify norovirus and SARS-CoV-2 proteins, and physiological proteins, as new TRIM7 substrates. We further show that TRIM7 may function as a restriction factor to promote the degradation of the viral proteins of norovirus and SARS-CoV-2, thereby restoring the Type I interferon immune response and inhibiting viral infection. Several crystal structures of TRIM7 in complex with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are also determined, and a conserved C-terminus glutamine-specific interaction is observed. These findings unveil a common recognition mode by TRIM7, providing the foundation for further mechanistic characterization of antiviral and cellular functions of TRIM7.",

    "abstract": "Many of the currently available anti-parasitic and anti-fungal frontline drugs have severe limitations, including adverse side effects, complex administration, and increasing occurrence of resistance. The discovery and development of new therapeutic agents is a costly and lengthy process. Therefore, repurposing drugs with already established clinical application offers an attractive, fast-track approach for novel treatment options. In this study, we show that the anti-cancer drug MitoTam, a mitochondria-targeted analog of tamoxifen, efficiently eliminates a wide range of evolutionarily distinct pathogens in vitro, including pathogenic fungi, Plasmodium falciparum, and several species of trypanosomatid parasites, causative agents of debilitating neglected tropical diseases. MitoTam treatment was also effective in vivo and significantly reduced parasitemia of two medically important parasites, Leishmania mexicana and Trypanosoma brucei, in their respective animal infection models. Functional analysis in the bloodstream form of T. brucei showed that MitoTam rapidly altered mitochondrial functions, particularly affecting cellular respiration, lowering ATP levels, and dissipating mitochondrial membrane potential. Our data suggest that the mode of action of MitoTam involves disruption of the inner mitochondrial membrane, leading to rapid organelle depolarization and cell death. Altogether, MitoTam is an excellent candidate drug against several important pathogens, for which there are no efficient therapies and for which drug development is not a priority.\n\nAuthor SummaryMitoTam, a mitochondrially targeted analog of tamoxifen, is a promising anti-cancer candidate drug acting by accumulating in and destabilizing cell mitochondria. In this study, we analyze its effect on a wide range of evolutionarily distinct and medically important pathogens. These include a) pathogenic fungi, Candida albicans, and Cryptococcus neoformans, ubiquitous opportunistic pathogens that cause life-threatening diseases in immunocompromised or immunologically deficient individuals; b) Plasmodium falciparum, the causative agent of human malaria; and c) several species of trypanosomatid parasites such as Trypanosoma cruzi, responsible for deadly Chagas disease in South America, Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of sleeping sickness in Africa, and Leishmania, the etiological agent of leishmaniasis, a spectrum of diseases ranging from usually self-healing but potentially disfiguring cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis, to visceral leishmaniasis, which is invariably fatal if left untreated.

Outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats are used for genetic mapping of complex traits, but to-date, a systems genetics analysis of metabolic tissues has not been done. We investigated whether adiposity-associated genes and gene co-expression networks in outbred heterogeneous stock (HS) rats overlap those found in humans. We analyzed RNAseq data from adipose tissue of 415 male HS rats, correlated these transcripts with body weight (BW) and compared transcriptome signatures to two human cohorts: the African American Genetics of Metabolism and Expression and Metabolic Syndrome in Men. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify adiposity-associated gene networks and mediation analysis to identify genes under genetic control whose expression drives adiposity. We identified 554 orthologous \"consensus genes\" whose expression correlates with BW in the rat and with body mass index (BMI) in both human cohorts. Consensus genes fell within eight co-expressed networks and were enriched for genes involved in immune system function, cell growth, extracellular matrix organization and lipid metabolic processes. We identified 19 consensus genes for which genetic variation may influence BW via their expression, including those involved in lipolysis (e.g., Hcar1), inflammation (e.g., Rgs1), adipogenesis (e.g., Tmem120b) or no previously known role in obesity (e.g., St14, Msa4a6). Strong concordance between HS rat and human BW/BMI associated transcripts demonstrates translational utility of the rat model, while identification of novel genes expands our knowledge of the genetics underlying obesity.",

    "abstract": "The active global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic caused more than 426 million cases and 5.8 million deaths worldwide. The development of completely new drugs for such a novel disease is a challenging, time intensive process. Despite researchers around the world working on this task, no effective treatments have been developed yet. This emphasizes the importance of drug repurposing, where treatments are found among existing drugs that are meant for different diseases. A common approach to this is based on knowledge graphs, that condense relationships between entities like drugs, diseases and genes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) can then be used for the task at hand by predicting links in such knowledge graphs. Expanding on state-of-the-art GNN research, Doshi et al. recently developed the Dr-COVID model. We further extend their work using additional output interpretation strategies. The best aggregation strategy derives a top-100 ranking of 8,070 candidate drugs, 32 of which are currently being tested in COVID-19-related clinical trials. Moreover, we present an alternative application for the model, the generation of additional candidates based on a given pre-selection of drug candidates using collaborative filtering. In addition, we improved the implementation of the Dr-COVID model by significantly shortening the inference and pre-processing time by exploiting data-parallelism. As drug repurposing is a task that requires high computation and memory resources, we further accelerate the post-processing phase using a new emerging hardware -- we propose a new approach to leverage the use of high-capacity Non-Volatile Memory for aggregate drug ranking.",
