    "abstract": "Worldwide SARS-CoV-2 sequencing efforts track emerging mutations in its spike protein, as well as characteristic mutations in other viral proteins. Besides their epidemiological importance, the observed SARS-CoV-2 sequences present an ensemble of viable protein variants, and thereby a source of information on viral protein structure and function. Charting the mutational landscape of the nucleocapsid (N) protein that facilitates viral assembly, we observe variability exceeding that of the spike protein, with more than 86% of residues that can be substituted, on average by 3-4 different amino acids. However, mutations exhibit an uneven distribution that tracks known structural features but also reveals highly protected stretches of unknown function. One of these conserved regions is in the central disordered linker proximal to the N-G215C mutation that has become dominant in the Delta variant, outcompeting G215 variants without further spike or N-protein substitutions. Structural models suggest that the G215C mutation stabilizes conserved transient helices in the disordered linker serving as protein-protein interaction interfaces. Comparing Delta variant N-protein to its ancestral version in biophysical experiments, we find a significantly more compact and less disordered structure. N-G215C exhibits substantially stronger self-association, shifting the unliganded protein from a dimeric to a tetrameric oligomeric state, which leads to enhanced co-assembly with nucleic acids. This suggests that the sequence variability of N-protein is mirrored by high plasticity of N-protein biophysical properties, which we hypothesize can be exploited by SARS-CoV-2 to achieve greater efficiency of viral assembly, and thereby enhanced infectivity.",

    "abstract": "The Omicron variant has become dominant in the U.S. and around the world. This variant is found to be 2-fold more infectious than the Delta variant, posing a significant threat of severe cases and death. We and others have recently reported that the N-terminus domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 of various variants is responsible for inducing cytokine release in human PBMCs. Here, we demonstrate that the NTD of the Omicron variant remains highly effective at inducing cytokine release in human PBMCs. Furthermore, we show that Ponatinib and a novel compound, Olverembatinib, are potent Omicron NTD-mediated cytokine release inhibitors. Target profiling revealed that Olverembatinib blocks most of the previously identified kinases responsible for cytokine release. Together, we propose that Ponatinib and Olverembatinib may represent an attractive therapeutic option for treating moderate to severe COVID-19 cases.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIThe N-terminus domain (NTD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant strongly induces multiple inflammatory molecules in PBMCs, unaffected by the mutations observed in the NTD.\nC_LIO_LIThe cytokine release mediated by the Omicron variant is comparable to the Delta variant.\nC_LIO_LIOlverembatinib, a clinical-stage multi-kinase inhibitor, potently inhibits Omicron NTD-mediated cytokine release.\nC_LIO_LIOlverembatinib could relieve severe symptoms associated with COVID-19 Omicron and Delta variants.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A well-tolerated and cost-effective oral drug that blocks SARS-CoV-2 growth and dissemination would be a major advance in the global effort to reduce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Here, we show that the oral FDA-approved drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and infection in different primate and human cell models including stem cell-derived human alveolar epithelial type 2 cells. Furthermore, NTZ synergizes with remdesivir, and it broadly inhibits growth of SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.351 (beta), P.1 (gamma), and B.1617.2 (delta) and viral syncytia formation driven by their spike proteins. Strikingly, oral NTZ treatment of Syrian hamsters significantly inhibits SARS-CoV-2-driven weight loss, inflammation, and viral dissemination and syncytia formation in the lungs. These studies show that NTZ is a novel host-directed therapeutic that broadly inhibits SARS-CoV-2 dissemination and pathogenesis in human and hamster physiological models, which supports further testing and optimization of NTZ-based therapy for SARS-CoV-2 infection alone and in combination with antiviral drugs.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThis study assessed formation of potentially infectious aerosols during processing of infectious samples in a real-world laboratory setting, which could then be applied in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).\n\nMethodsThis two-part study assessed aerosol formation when using cobas e analyzers only and in an end-to-end laboratory workflow. To estimate aerosol formation, recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) was used as a surrogate marker for infectious virus particles to evaluate the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to laboratory operators. Using the HBsAg model, air sampling was performed at different positions around the cobas e analyzers and in four scenarios reflecting critical handling and/or transport locations in an end-to-end laboratory workflow. Aerosol formation of HBsAg was quantified using the Elecsys(R) HBsAg II quant II assay. The model was then applied to a SARS-CoV-2 context using SARS-CoV-2 infection-specific parameters to calculate viral RNA copies.\n\nResultsFollowing application to SARS-CoV-2, the mean HBsAg uptake per hour when recalculated into viral RNA copies was 1.9 viral RNA copies across the cobas e analyzers and 0.87 viral RNA copies across all tested scenarios in an end-to-end laboratory workflow. This corresponds to a maximum aspiration rate of <16 viral RNA copies during an 8-hour shift when using cobas e analyzers and/or in an end-to-end laboratory workflow.\n\nConclusionsThe low production of marker-containing aerosol when using cobas e analyzers and in an end-to-end laboratory workflow is consistent with a remote risk of laboratory-acquired SARS-CoV-2 infection for laboratory operators.\n\nSummaryThis study investigated the formation of potentially infectious aerosols during processing of infectious samples in a model using hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a marker for infectious virus particles. The risk to laboratory operators of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was then inferred. Air sampling was performed around cobas e analyzers and in an end-to-end laboratory workflow, after which HBsAg was quantified and applied to SARS-CoV-2 using SARS-CoV-2 infection-specific parameters. The maximum aspiration rate of <16 viral RNA copies/8-hour shift, when applied to a SARS-CoV-2 context, poses a remote risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to laboratory operators.",

    "abstract": "Large/abnormal offspring syndrome (LOS/AOS) is a congenital overgrowth syndrome reported in ruminants produced by assisted reproduction (ART-LOS) which exhibit global disruption of the epigenome and transcriptome. LOS/AOS shares phenotypes and epigenotypes with the human congenital overgrowth condition Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. We have reported that LOS occurs spontaneously (SLOS), however, to date, no study has been conducted to determine if SLOS has the same methylome epimutations as ART-LOS. In this study, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing to examine global DNA methylation in SLOS and ART-LOS tissues. We observed unique patterns of global distribution of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) over different genomic contexts, such as promoters, CpG islands and surrounding regions, and repetitive sequences from different treatment groups. In addition, we identified hundreds of LOS-vulnerable DMRs across different cattle breeds when analyzing four idependent LOS experiments together. Specifically, there are 25 highly vulnerable DMRs that could potentially serve as molecular markers for the diagnosis of LOS, including at the promoters of DMRT2 and TBX18, at the imprinted gene bodies of IGF2R, PRDM8, and BLCAP/NNAT, and at multiple CpG islands. We also observed tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns between muscle and blood, and conservation of ART-induced DNA methylation changes between muscle and blood. We conclude that as in ART-LOS, alterations of the epigenome are involved in the etiology of SLOS. In addition, SLOS and ART-LOS share some similarities in methylome epimutations.",

    "abstract": "Grazing by large mammalian herbivores impacts climate as it can favor the size and stability of a large carbon (C) pool in soil. As native herbivores in the worlds grasslands, steppes, and savannas are progressively being displaced by livestock, it is important to ask whether livestock can emulate the functional roles of their native counterparts. While livestock and native herbivores can have remarkable similarity in their traits, they can differ greatly in their impacts on vegetation composition which can affect soil-C. It is uncertain how their similarities and differences impact soil-C via their influence on microbial decomposers. We test competing alternative hypotheses with a replicated, long-term, landscape-level, grazing-exclusion experiment to ask whether livestock in the Trans-Himalayan ecosystem of northern India can match decadal-scale (2005-2016) soil-C stocks under native herbivores. We evaluate multiple lines of evidence from 17 variables that influence soil-C (quantity and quality of C-input from plants, microbial biomass and metabolism, microbial community composition, veterinary antibiotics in soil), and asses their inter-relationships. Livestock and native herbivores differed in their effects on several soil microbial processes. Microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) was 19% lower in soils under livestock. Compared to native herbivores, areas used by livestock contained 1.5 kg C m-2 less soil-C. Structural equation models showed that alongside effects arising from plants, livestock alter soil microbial communities which is detrimental for CUE, and ultimately also for soil-C. Supporting evidence pointed toward a link between veterinary antibiotics used on livestock, microbial communities, and soil-C. Overcoming the challenges of sequestrating antibiotics to minimize their potential impacts on climate, alongside microbial rewilding under livestock, may reconcile the conflicting demands from food-security and ecosystem services. Conservation of native herbivores and better management of livestock is crucial for soil-C stewardship to envision and achieve natural climate solutions.",

Here we use deep sequencing to investigate the transmission of viral genetic variation among individuals during a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that infected the vast majority of crew members on a fishing boat. We deep-sequenced nasal swabs to characterize the within-host viral population of infected crew members, using experimental duplicates and strict computational filters to ensure accurate variant calling. We find that within-host viral diversity is low in infected crew members. The mutations that did fix in some crew members during the outbreak are not observed at detectable frequencies in any of the sampled crew members in which they are not fixed, suggesting viral evolution involves occasional fixation of low-frequency mutations during transmission rather than persistent maintenance of within-host viral diversity. Overall, our results show that strong transmission bottlenecks dominate viral evolution even during a superspreading event with a very high attack rate.",

    "abstract": "Responsible for the conversion of L-tyrosine to p-coumaric acid in Flavobacterium johnsoniae, FjTAL has drawn the attention of many biochemical engineers who wish to carry out a sustainable biosynthetic scheme for the production of aromatic compounds. In this study, with the aid of various computational tools, the secondary and tertiary structures of FjTAL have been predicted. The results suggest that FjTAL forms a homo-tetramer when active as a cytosolic enzyme and it is mostly consisted of alpha helices. With the aid of molecular docking, one can hypothesize that FjTAL is likely to bind to L-tyrosine, p-coumaric acid, and caffeic acid with a similar molecular mechanism and thus, p-coumaric acid and caffeic acid may exhibit a negative feedback response toward the enzyme and inhibit its activity competitively. Two distinct binding pockets have been discovered, one of which contains highly conserved residues among several species. The residues which form the prosthetic group 3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) also emerge in the evolutionary conserved binding pocket. The other discovered cavity, could either be a second binding site for the ligands or simply an artifact of the molecular docking task.",

    "abstract": "The highly conserved Notch pathway transmits signals between neighboring cells to elicit distinct downstream transcriptional programs. In given contexts, Notch is a major regulator of cell fate specification, proliferation, and apoptosis, such that aberrant Notch signaling leads to a pleiotropy of human diseases, including developmental disorders and cancers. The canonical pathway signals through the transcription factor CSL (RBPJ in mammals), which forms a transcriptional activation complex with the intracellular domain of the Notch receptor and the coactivator Mastermind. CSL can also function as a transcriptional repressor by forming complexes with one of several different corepressor proteins, such as FHL1 or SHARP in mammals and Hairless in Drosophila. Recently, we identified the malignant brain tumor (MBT) family member L3MBTL3 as a bona fide RBPJ binding corepressor that recruits the repressive lysine demethylase LSD1/KDM1A to Notch target genes. Here we define the RBPJ-interacting domain (RBP-ID) of L3MBTL3 and report the 2.06 [A] crystal structure of the complex formed between RBPJ, the RBP-ID of L3MBTL3 and DNA. The structure reveals the molecular interactions underlying L3MBTL3 complexation with RBPJ, which we comprehensively analyze with a series of L3MBTL3 and RBPJ mutations that span the binding interface. Compared to other RBPJ-binding proteins, we find that L3MBTL3 interacts with RBPJ via an unusual binding motif, which is sensitive to mutations throughout its RBPJ-interacting region. We also show that these disruptive mutations affect RBPJ and L3MBTL3 function in cells, providing further insights into Notch mediated transcriptional regulation.",

    "abstract": "The role of autoantibodies in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) complications is not yet fully understood. The current investigation screened two independent cohorts of 97 COVID-19 patients (Discovery (Disc) cohort from Qatar (n = 49) and Replication (Rep) cohort from New York (n = 48)) utilizing high-throughput KoRectly Expressed (KREX) immunome protein-array technology. Autoantibody responses to 57 proteins were significantly altered in the COVID-19 Disc cohort compared to healthy controls (P [&le;] 0.05). The Rep cohort had altered autoantibody responses against 26 proteins compared to non-COVID-19 ICU patients that served as controls. Both cohorts showed substantial similarities (r2 = 0.73) and exhibited higher autoantibodies responses to numerous transcription factors, immunomodulatory proteins, and human disease markers. Analysis of the combined cohorts revealed elevated autoantibody responses against SPANXN4, STK25, ATF4, PRKD2, and CHMP3 proteins in COVID-19 patients. KREX analysis of the specific IgG autoantibody responses indicates that the targeted host proteins are supposedly increased in COVID-19 patients. The autoantigen-autoantibody response was cross-validated for SPANXN4 and STK25 proteins using Uniprot BLASTP and sequence alignment tools. SPANXN4 is essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility, which may predict a potential role for this protein in COVID-19 associated male reproductive tract complications and warrants further research.\n\nSignificance StatementCoronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, has emerged as a global pandemic with a high morbidity rate and multiorgan complications. It is observed that the host immune system contributes to the varied responses to COVID-19 pathogenesis. Autoantibodies, immune system proteins that mistakenly target the bodys own tissue, may underlie some of this variation. We screened total IgG autoantibody responses against 1,318 human proteins in two COVID-19 patient cohorts. We observed several novel markers in COVID-19 patients that are associated with male fertility, such as sperm protein SPANXN4, STK25, and the apoptotic factor ATF4. Particularly, elevated levels of autoantibodies against the testicular tissue-specific protein SPANXN4 offer significant evidence of anticipating the protein role in COVID-19 associated male reproductive complications.",

    "abstract": "Decontamination of surfaces and items plays an important role in reducing the spread of infectious microorganisms in many settings including hospitals and research institutes. Regardless of the location, appropriate decontamination procedures are required for maintaining biosafety and biosecurity. For example, effective decontamination of microbial cultures is essential to ensure proper biocontainment and safety within microbiological laboratories. To this end, many commercial decontamination agents are available which have been tested to a prescribed standard to substantiate their efficacy. However, these standardised tests are unlikely to accurately reflect all conditions encountered in medical and biomedical research. Despite this, laboratory workers and other users of decontamination agents may assume that all decontamination agents will work in all situations. We tested commonly used commercial decontamination agents against a range of bacterial species to determine their efficacy under real-world laboratory conditions. As each decontamination agent has a different recommended dilution for use, to compare their efficacy we calculated their  effective ratio which reflects the difference between the manufacturer-recommended dilution and the dilution needed to achieve decontamination under real-world laboratory conditions. Effective ratios above 1 indicate that the agent was active at a dilution more dilute than recommended whereas effective ratios lower than 1 indicate that the agent required a higher concentration than recommended. Our results show that the quaternary ammonium agents TriGene Advance and Chemgene HLD4L were the most active out of the agents tested, with biocidal activity measured at up to 64 times the recommended dilution. In contrast, hypochlorite (bleach) and Prevail (stabilised hydrogen peroxide) had the lowest effective ratios amongst the tested agents. In conclusion, our data suggest that not all decontamination agents will work at the recommended dilutions under real-world laboratory conditions. We recommend that the protocols for the use of decontamination agents are verified under the specific conditions required to ensure they are fit for purpose.",

    "abstract": "Reprogramming of gene expression during transition from exponential growth to stationary phase is crucial for bacterial survival. In the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis, this process is mainly governed by the activity of the global transcription regulators AbrB, CodY and Spo0A. We recently showed that the transcription termination factor Rho, known for its ubiquitous role in the inhibition of antisense transcription, is involved in Spo0A-mediated regulation of differentiation programs specific to the stationary phase in B. subtilis. To identify other aspects of the regulatory role of Rho during adaptation to starvation, we have constructed a B. subtilis strain that expresses rho at a relatively stable high level in order to circumvent its decrease occurring in the wild-type cells entering the stationary phase. We show that B. subtilis cells stably expressing Rho fail to sporulate and to develop genetic competence, which is largely, but not exclusively, due to abnormally low expression of the master regulator Spo0A. Moreover, in addition to a global decrease of antisense transcription, these cells exhibit genome-wide alterations of sense transcription. A significant part of these alterations affects genes from global regulatory networks of cellular adaptation to the stationary phase and reflects the attenuated de-repression of the AbrB and CodY regulons and the weakened stringent response. Accordingly, stabilization of Rho level reprograms stationary phase-specific physiology of B. subtilis cells, negatively affects cellular adaptation to nutrient limitations and alters cell-fate decision-making to such an extent that it blocks development of genetic competence and sporulation. Taken together, these results indicate that the activity of termination factor Rho constitutes a previously unknown layer of control over the stationary phase and post-exponential adaptive strategies in B. subtilis, from the adjustment of cellular metabolism to the activation of survival programs.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common cause of bacterial illness worldwide. Current vaccines based on the polysaccharide capsule (PCV-13 and PPSV-23) are only effective against a limited number of the >100 capsular serotypes. A universal vaccine based on conserved protein antigens requires a thorough understanding of gene expression in S. pneumoniae. Restriction-Modification (R-M) systems, classically described as a defence against bacteriophage, are almost ubiquitous in the bacterial domain, and roles other than phage defence. All S. pneumoniae strains encode the SpnIII R-M system. This system contains a phase-variable methyltransferase that randomly switches specificity, and controls expression of multiple genes; a phasevarion. We aimed to determine the role of the SpnIII phasevarion during pneumococcal pathobiology and determine if phase-variation resulted in differences in expression of protein antigens that are being investigated as vaccine candidates. Using  locked S. pneumoniae strains that express a single SpnIII methyltransferase specificity, we found significant differences in clinically relevant traits, including survival in blood, and adherence to and invasion of human cells. Crucially, we also observed differences in expression of numerous proteinaceous vaccine candidates, which complicates selection of protein antigens for inclusion in a universal protein-based pneumococcal vaccine. This study will inform future vaccine design against S. pneumoniae by ensuring only stably expressed candidates are included in a rationally designed vaccine.\n\nSignificance StatementS. pneumoniae is the worlds foremost bacterial pathogen. S. pneumoniae encodes a randomly expressed epigenetic regulator, a phasevarion (phase-variable regulon), that results in random expression of multiple genes. Previous work demonstrated that the pneumococcal SpnIII phasevarion switches between six different expression states, generating six unique phenotypic variants in a pneumococcal population. Here, we show that this phasevarion generates multiple phenotypic differences relevant to pathobiology. Importantly, expression of conserved protein antigens varies with phasevarion switching. As capsule expression, a major pneumococcal virulence factor, is also controlled by the phasevarion, our work will inform the selection of the best candidates to include in a rationally designed, universal pneumococcal vaccine.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a betacoronavirus and the etiological agent of COVID-19, a devastating infectious disease. Due to its far-reaching effect on human health, there is an urgent and growing need to understand the viral molecular biology of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with the host cell. SARS-CoV-2 encodes 9 predicted accessory proteins, which are presumed to be dispensable for in vitro replication, most likely having a role in modulating the host cell environment to aid viral replication. Here we show that the ORF6 accessory protein interacts with cellular Rae1 to inhibit cellular protein production by blocking mRNA export. We utilised cell fractionation coupled with mRNAseq to explore which cellular mRNA species are affected by ORF6 expression and show that ORF6 can inhibit the export of many mRNA including those encoding antiviral factors such as IRF1 and RIG-I. We also show that export of these mRNA is blocked in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 can manipulate the host cell environment to supress antiviral responses, providing further understanding to the replication strategies of a virus that has caused an unprecedented global health crisis.\n\nAuthor SummarySARS-CoV-2 is the virus responsible for the current COVID-19 pandemic. Coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV-2, replicate their genome in the cytoplasm of the host cell by hijacking the cellular machinery. In addition to structural proteins and viral enzymes, SARS-CoV-2 encodes 9 accessory proteins. Although these are not required for in vitro replication, they are thought to modulate the host cell environment to favour viral replication. In this work, we show that the ORF6 accessory protein can supress cellular protein production by blocking mRNA nuclear export through interacting with the cellular protein Rae1, a known mRNA export factor. We also investigated which cellular mRNAs were retained in the nucleus when ORF6 was overexpressed. Interestingly, we found that ORF6 inhibited the export of many different mRNAs, including those encoding antiviral factors, like IRF1 and RIG-I, even in the absence of stimulation by interferon. Importantly, we found that the export of these mRNAs was similarly affected in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we believe we have identified a novel mechanism that SARS-CoV-2 uses to suppress antiviral responses in order to make the cell more permissive to infection.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrion of malaria parasites is an attractive antimalarial drug target, which require mitoribosomes to translate genes encoded in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Plasmodium mitoribosomes are composed of highly fragmented ribosomal RNA (rRNA) encoded in the mtDNA. All mitoribosomal proteins (MRPs) and other assembly factors are encoded in the nuclear genome. Here, we have studied one small subunit (SSU) MRP, RSM22 (Pf3D7_1027200) and one large subunit (LSU) MRP, L23 (Pf3D7_1239100) in Plasmodium falciparum. We show that both proteins localize to the mitochondrion and are essential for parasite survival. However, the parasites survive conditional knock down (KD) of PfRSM22 for two days longer than PfMRPL23 KD. RNA sequencing revealed transcriptomic changes of the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes upon KD of these MRPs. In the early phase following KD, while most mt rRNAs and transcripts of putative MRPs were downregulated in the absence of PfRSM22, several mt rRNAs and MRPs were upregulated after KD of PfMRPL23. At the late time points of KD, loss of PfRSM22 and PfMRPL23 caused defects in many essential metabolic pathways, leading to parasite death. There was a significant overlap among the mitochondrial related transcripts downregulated in the late phase of PfRSM22 and PfMRPL23 KDs. We have also identified a list of mitochondrial proteins of unknown function that are likely Plasmodium MRPs based on their structural similarity to known MRPs as well as their expression profiles in KD parasites.",

In this study, the bacterial strains PL152T and PL155 were isolated from taro corms in Hawaii in 2018, and characterized using genomic and biochemical assays. The Next Generation Sequencing technologies, Oxford Nanopore MinION and Illumina NovaSeq, were used for whole genome sequencing of the PL152T strain. Short and long reads were assembled using the Unicycler tool accessible at the bioinformatic resource center, and PATRIC (PathoSystems Resource Integration Center) was used to generate a more accurate and reliable \"hybrid\" assembly. The 16S rRNA analysis of PL152T with type strains of other known Pectobacterium species showed a close relationship with P. fontis. Multi-locus sequence analysis using nine housekeeping genes (dnaA, gapA, gyrB, recA, dnaN, rpoS, mdh, rpoA and dnaK) differentiated strain PL152T from other species of Pectobacterium and formed a unique and well-defined clade. The concurrent results of average nucleotide identity (ANI) and digital DNA-DNA hybridization, with calculated values lower than 95 and 70%, respectively, supported the delineation of a novel bacterial species. Here, we proposed Pectobacterium colocasium, strain PL152T (=ICMP 24362T; LMG 32536 T) and PL155 as a novel species in the genus Pectobacterium.\n\n1.5 RepositoriesCP091064; MZ542535 - MZ542540; OM457660",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial species are represented by a pan-genome, whose genetic repertoire far outstrips that of any single bacterial genome. Here we investigate how a bacterial pan-genome might influence gene essentiality, and whether essential genes that are initially critical for the survival of an organism can evolve to become non-essential. By using Tn-Seq, whole-genome sequencing, and RNA-Seq on a set of 36 clinical Streptococcus pneumoniae strains representative of >68% of the species pan-genome, we identify a species-wide  essentialome that can be subdivided into universal, strain-specific and accessory essential genes. By employing  forced-evolution experiments we show that specific genetic changes allow bacteria to bypass essentiality. Moreover, by untangling several genetic mechanisms we show that gene-essentiality can be highly influenced and/or dependent on: 1) the composition of the accessory genome; 2) the accumulation of toxic intermediates; 3) functional redundancy; 4) efficient recycling of critical metabolites; and 5) pathway rewiring. While this functional characterization underscores the evolvability-potential of many essential genes, we also show that genes with differential essentiality remain important antimicrobial drug target candidates, as their inactivation almost always has a severe fitness cost in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Several compounds have been tested against SARS-CoV-2; at present, COVID-19 treatments decrease the deleterious inflammatory response and acute lung injury. However, the best therapeutic response would be expected by combining anti-inflammatory properties, while concomitantly blocking viral replication. These combined effects should drastically reduce both infection rate and severe complications induced by novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Therefore, we explored the antiviral potency of a class of anti-inflammatory compounds that inhibit the N-Acylethanolamine acid amidase (NAAA). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of palmitoylethanolamide (PEA), a bioactive lipid that mediates anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity through the activation of peroxisome proliferator receptor- (PPAR-). Similarly, this pathway is likely to be a significant target to impede viral replication since PPAR- activation leads to dismantling of lipid droplets, where viral replication of Flaviviruses and Coronaviruses occurs.\n\nHere, we show that either genetic or pharmacological inhibition of the NAAA enzyme leads to five-fold reduction in the replication of both SARS-CoV-2 and ZIKV in various cell lines. Once NAAA enzyme is blocked, both ZIKV and SARS CoV-2 replication decrease, which parallels a sudden five-fold decrease in virion release. These effects induced by NAAA inhibition occurs concomitantly with stimulation of autophagy during infection. Remarkably, parallel antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects of NAAA antagonism were confirmed in ex-vivo experiments, within SARS-CoV-2 infected human PBMC cells, in which both viral genomes and TNF- production drop by ~60%. It is known that macrophages contribute to viral spread, excessive inflammation and macrophage activation syndrome that NAAA inhibitors might prevent, reducing the macrophage-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent death of COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "Viral infection of farmed fish and shellfish represents a major issue within the aquaculture industry. One potential control strategy involves RNA interference of viral gene expression through the oral delivery of specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). In previous work we have shown that recombinant dsRNA can be produced in the chloroplast of the edible microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and used to control disease in shrimp. Here we report a significant improvement in antiviral dsRNA production and its use to protect shrimp against white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). A new strategy for dsRNA synthesis was developed that uses two convergent copies of the endogenous rrnS promoter to drive high level transcription of both strands of the WSSV gene element in the chloroplast. New vectors were designed that allow rapid Golden Gate-mediated assembly of a transformation plasmid in which the  dual promoter-WSSV DNA cassette is targeted into the chloroplast genome, with selection based on the restoration of photosynthesis. PCR analysis of transformant lines confirmed the integration of the cassette and homoplasmy of the polyploid genome. Transcribed sense and antisense VP28-RNA were hypothesised to form an RNA duplex in the chloroplast stroma, and quantitative RT-PCR indicated that [~]100 g dsRNA is produced per litre of transgenic microalgae culture. This represents an [~]10,000-fold increase in dsRNA relative to previous reports using convergent psaA promoters. The engineered alga was assessed for its ability to prevent WSSV infection when fed to shrimp larvae prior to a challenge with the virus. Survival of shrimp fed with dsRNA-expressing C. reinhardtii was significantly enhanced (68.3%) relative to the negative control. The study suggests that this new dsRNA production platform is significantly more efficient than that reported previously, and merits further scale-up and downstream processing studies.",

To test this hypothesis, we created a Padi2/Padi4 double knockout (DKO) mouse model and tested these mice along with wild-type FVB/NJ (WT) and both strains of SKO mice for a range of reproductive defects.\n\nResultsControlled breeding trials found that male DKO mice appeared to take longer to have their first litter than WT controls. This tendency was maintained when these mice were mated to either DKO and WT females. Additionally, unsexed 2-day old DKO pups and male DKO weanlings both weighed significantly less than their WT counterparts, took significantly longer than WT males to reach puberty, and had consistently lower serum testosterone levels. Furthermore, 90-day old adult DKO males had smaller testes than WT males with increased rates of germ cell apoptosis.\n\nConclusionsThe Padi2/Padi4 DKO mouse model provides a new tool for investigating PAD function and outcomes from our studies provide the first in vivo evidence linking PADs with hormone signaling.",

In this work, we used for the first time a fast, simple, and visual method based on the loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (LAMP) to detect Loxosceles envenomation. Using the DNA from L. similis legs, we observed a high sensitivity using this test since as low as 0.32 pg of DNA could be detected. This pH-dependent colorimetric assay was 64 times more sensitive than PCR to detect spider DNA. The test was specific for Loxosceles once no cross-reaction was observed when testing DNA from different agents that cause similar dermonecrotic injuries. The test allowed the detection of Loxosceles intermedia DNA from hair, serum, and swab samples obtained from experimentally-envenomed rabbit within 72 h. The method sensitivity varied according to the sample and the collection time, reaching 100% sensitivity in serum and hair, respectively, 1 h and 24 h after the experimental envenomation.

The encoded proteins suggest a role for PURA in immune responses, mitochondrial function, autophagy and processing (P)-body activity. Intriguingly, reduced PURA levels decrease the expression of the integral P-body components LSM14A and DDX6 and strongly affect P-body formation in human cells. Furthermore, PURA knockdown results in stabilization of P-body-enriched transcripts, whereas other mRNAs decrease. Hence, reduced PURA levels, as reported in patients with PURA Syndrome, influence the formation and composition of this phase-separated RNA processing machinery. Our study proposes PURA Syndrome as a new model to study the tight connection between P-body-associated RNA regulation and neurodevelopmental disorders.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/479353v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5712f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9eb133org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@83b7b2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1912e5c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Homologous recombination is the predominant double-strand DNA break repair pathway in Escherichia coli. A recent report of non-homologous end joining involving the Ku-like Gam protein of bacteriophage Mu (MuGam) has sparked interest in understanding the functions of DNA end-binding proteins in bacteria. MuGam binds to DNA ends, but how it interferes with DNA repair or transcription in live bacteria remains elusive. In E. coli, RNA polymerase secondary channel interactors, such as the Gre factors, play a role in coordinating transcription with DNA replication and break repair. Here we show that MuGam inhibits break repair by slowing down DNA resection and impeding recombination in living cells. Loss of GreA restores break repair in the presence of MuGam by allowing for increased DNA resection due to a potential release of MuGam from the DNA. Using MuGam as a DNA break sensor, we found that breaks are generated when translation is inhibited, more so in the presence of GreA, supporting the model where transcription-translation uncoupling increases transcription/replication collisions. Significantly, this work reveals that modulation of RNA polymerase can impact DNA break repair in presence of a Ku-like protein.",

    "abstract": "Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus, optic nerve atrophy, hearing loss, diabetes insipidus, and progressive neurodegeneration. Pathogenic variants in the WFS1 gene are the main causes of Wolfram syndrome. WFS1 encodes a transmembrane protein localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and regulates the unfolded protein response (UPR). Loss of function of WFS1 leads to dysregulation of insulin production and secretion, ER calcium depletion, and cytosolic calpains activation, resulting in activation of apoptotic cascades. Although the terminal UPR has been shown to induce inflammation that accelerates {beta}-cell dysfunction and death in diabetes, the contribution of {beta}-cell inflammation to the development of diabetes in Wolfram syndrome has not been fully understood. Here we show that WFS1-deficiency enhances the gene expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, leading to cytokine-induced ER-stress and cell death in pancreatic {beta}-cells. PERK and IRE1 pathways mediate high glucose-induced inflammation in a {beta}-cell model of Wolfram syndrome. M1-macrophage infiltration and hypervascularization are seen in the pancreatic islets of Wfs1 whole-body knockout mice, demonstrating that WFS1 regulates anti-inflammatory responses in {beta}-cells. Our results demonstrate that inflammation plays an essential role in the progression of {beta}-cell death and diabetes in Wolfram syndrome and reveal that the pathways involved in ER stress-mediated inflammation provide potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of Wolfram syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Viral discovery studies in wild animals often rely on cross-sectional surveys at a single time point. As a result, our understanding of the temporal stability of wild animal viromes remains poorly resolved. While studies of single host-virus systems indicate that host and environmental factors influence seasonal virus transmission dynamics, comparable insights for whole viral communities in multiple hosts are lacking. Leveraging non-invasive faecal samples from a long-term wild rodent study, we characterised viral communities of three common European rodent species (Apodemus sylvaticus, A. flavicollis, and M. glareolus) living in temperate woodland over a single year. Our findings indicate that a substantial fraction of the rodent virome is seasonally transient and associated with vertebrate or bacteria hosts. Further analyses of one of the most abundant virus families, Picornaviruses, show pronounced temporal changes in viral richness and diversity, which were associated with concurrent and up to [~]3-month lags in host density, ambient temperature, rainfall and humidity, suggesting complex feedbacks from the host and environmental factors on virus transmission and shedding in seasonal habitats. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of understanding the seasonal dynamics of wild animal viromes in order to better predict and mitigate zoonotic risks.",

    "abstract": "Future environmental shifts foster plant research aiming to develop climate-smart cultivars but the past and current impacts on the environment are also a key to unraveling a major part of the phenotypic adaptation of crops. These studies may determine the most relevant environmental components of yield stability and adaptability within a breeding framework. Here, as a proof-concept study, we quantified the impacts of climate drivers in adapting common bean across Brazilian regions and seasons. We developed an  enviromic prediction approach based on Generalized Additive Models (GAM), large-scale environmental covariate data (EC), and grain yield (GY) of 18 years of a common bean breeding program. Then, we predicted the optimum limits for ECs for each production scenario. We verified the ability of GAM-based models to explain the climate driver GY variation and performed accurate predictions for diverse production scenarios (four regions, three seasons, and two grain types). Our results indicates that air temperature (maximum and minimum), accumulated solar radiation, and rainfalls are mostly associated as the main drivers of GY variation in most regions. We also observed a huge variability of the climate drivers impact for the same germplasm cultivated across different seasons for each region. Furthermore, this climate influence in common beans adaptation is more evident during the vegetative for some seasons, while more impressive for reproductive stages for other seasons. Consequently, it demands higher efforts from breeding programs in developing region- or season-specific ideotype cultivars. Enviromics prediction with GAM was useful to identify the effect of climate on critical crop stages, which indirectly might help breeders in developing climate-smart varieties. We envisage its use with research field trial data (e.g., advanced yield testing) and historical farm field yield aimed at understanding breeding gaps in developing adapted cultivars for growing scenarios.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe developed an  enviromic prediction approach based on Generalized Additive Models (GAM) for a large-scale environmental covariate data and grain yield\nC_LIO_LIWe verified the ability of GAM-based models to explain the climate driver grain yield variation and performed accurate predictions for diverse production scenarios (four regions, three seasons, and two grain types)\nC_LIO_LIClimatic limitations for cropping commun beans were identified across seasons and regions.\nC_LIO_LI\"Optimum\" values for climate variables in different common bean regions productions were obtained .\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Crop adaptation is required to sustainably increase the rate of yield gains to meet projected future needs under the challenging conditions of climate change and competition for resources. Future adaptation will likely need to harness both highly polygenic traits and genotype-by-environment interactions (GxE), the study of which is aided by complex recombinant populations. We used the diverse Oryza sativa Global Multiparent Advanced Generation InterCross (MAGIC) population to study the genetic architecture and contributions of seedling emergence, establishment, and development to yield components under dry-direct seeding and seedling stage drought across three growing seasons. Dry-direct seeding is an establishment practice that has the potential to reduce methane emissions, water use, and labor demands for rice farmers, but increases the possibility of early-season drought conditions. We found substantial evidence for large roles of environmental variation and GxE in controlling trait variation. Maintenance of shoot growth during seedling stage drought was positively correlated with crown root number and both directly and indirectly influenced agronomic traits. Other than the major green revolution locus sd1, most allelic effects were conditionally neutral (affecting trait values in some environments but not others) and most alleles had their strongest effect in an environmental extreme. This discovery is both a challenge and a potential opportunity: with variable genetic architecture, selection in any one environment may not result in stable trait gains across environments. However, conditionally neutral GxE is a potential route to sustainable yield stability through allele pyramiding.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli is an opportunistic pathogen that can colonize or infect various host species. There is a significant gap in our understanding to what extent genetic lineages of E. coli are adapted or restricted to specific hosts. In addition, genomic determinants underlying such host specificity are unknown.By analyzing a randomly sampled collection of 1198 whole-genome sequenced E. coli isolates from four countries (Germany, UK, Spain, and Vietnam), obtained from five host species (human, pig, cattle, chicken, and wild boar) over 16 years, from both healthy and diseased hosts, we demonstrate that certain lineages of E. coli are frequently detected in specific hosts. We report a novel nan gene cluster, designated nan-9, putatively encoding acetylesterases and determinants of uptake and metabolism of sialic acid, to be associated with the human host as identified through genome wide association studies. In silico characterization predicts nan-9 to be involved in sialic acid (Sia) metabolism. In vitro growth experiments with a representative {Delta}nan E. coli mutant strain, using sialic acids 5-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) and N-glycolyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) as the sole carbon source, indicate an impaired growth behaviour compared to the wild-type. In addition, we identified several additional E. coli genes that are potentially associated with adaptation to human, cattle and chicken hosts, but not for the pig host. Collectively, this study provides an extensive overview of genetic determinants which may mediate host specificity in E. coli. Our findings should inform risk analysis and epidemiological monitoring of (antimicrobial resistant) E. coli.",

    "abstract": "Dracaena, a remarkably long-lived and slowly maturing species, is famous all over the world for the production of dragons blood, a precious traditional medicine used by different cultures since ancient times. However, lacking a high-quality genome,the molecular mechanisms underlying these traits are largely unknown and that greatly restricts the protection and regeneration of the rare and endangered plant resources. Here, we sequenced and assembled a chromosome-level genome of the Dracaena cochinchinensis, the first to be sequenced of Dracaena Vand. ex L.

Analyzing this phenomenon computationally in the human genome requires careful disentangling of intrinsic confounding factors, including overlapping and interrupted motifs, and recurrent sequencing errors. Accounting for these factors eliminates all signals of repeat-induced mutagenesis that extend beyond the motif boundary, and eliminates or dramatically shrinks the magnitude of mutagenesis within some motifs, contradicting previous reports. Mutagenesis not attributable to artifacts revealed several biological mechanisms. Polymerase slippage generates frequent indels within every variety of short tandem repeat motif, implicating slipped-strand structures. Interruption-correcting SNVs within STRs distinctly implicate error-prone Pol{kappa}.

    "abstract": "DNA replication perturbs chromatin by triggering the eviction, replacement and incorporation of nucleosomes. How this dynamic is orchestrated in time and space is poorly understood. Here, we apply a recently established sensor for histone exchange to follow the time-resolved histone H3 exchange profile in budding yeast cells undergoing synchronous replication. We find that new histones are incorporated not only behind, but also ahead of the replication fork. We provide evidence that Rtt109, the S phase-specific acetyltransferase, stabilizes nucleosomes behind the fork, but promotes H3 replacement ahead of the fork. Unexpectedly, increased replacement ahead of the fork is independent of the primary Rtt109 acetylation target H3K56, and rather results from Rtt109 activity towards the H3 N-terminus. Our results suggest that selective incorporation of differentially modified H3s behind and ahead of the replication fork results in opposing effects on histone exchange, which may contribute to genome stability by overcoming replication-associated challenges.",

We have found that IDH3 {beta} subunit (IDH3B) is essential for IDH3 activity in multiple tissues. Loss of Idh3b in mice causes substantial accumulation of the isocitrate and its precursors in the TCA cycle, particularly in the testes, whereas the levels of the downstream metabolites remain unchanged or slightly increased. The Idh3b-knockout (KO) mice have normal visual function without retinal degeneration. However, the male KO mice are infertile. Loss of Idh3b causes energetic deficit and disrupts the biogenesis of acrosome and flagellum, resulting in spermiogenesis arrestment in sperm cells. Together, we demonstrate IDH3B controls its substrate levels in the TCA cycle and it is required for sperm mitochondrial metabolism and spermiogenesis, highlighting the importance of the tissue-specific function of the ubiquitous TCA cycle.",

We investigate the PMPC-PDPA polymersome insertion at the single chain/receptor level using all-atom molecular modelling. We propose a theoretical statistical mechanics-based model for polymersome-cell association that explicitly considers the interaction of the polymersome with the cell glycocalyx shedding light on its effect on the polymersome binding. We validate our model experimentally and show that the binding energy is a non-linear function, allowing us to tune interaction by varying the radius and degrees of polymerisation. Finally, we show that PMPC-PDPA polymersomes can be used to target monocytes in vivo due to their promiscuous interaction with SRB1, CD36 and CD81.",

Here we decipher Renilla-type bioluminescence through crystallographic, spectroscopic, and computational experiments. Structures of ancestral and extant luciferases complexed with the substrate-like analogue azacoelenterazine or a reaction product were obtained, providing unprecedented snapshots of coelenterazine-to-coelenteramide oxidation. Bound coelenterazine adopts a Y-shaped conformation, enabling the deprotonated imidazopyrazinone component to attack O2 via a radical charge-transfer mechanism. A high emission intensity is secured by an aspartate from a conserved proton-relay system, which protonates the excited coelenteramide product. Another aspartate on the rim of the catalytic pocket fine-tunes the electronic state of coelenteramide and promotes the formation of the blue light-emitting phenolate anion. The results obtained also reveal structural features distinguishing flash-type from glow-type bioluminescence, providing insights that will guide the engineering of next-generation luciferase-luciferin pairs for ultrasensitive optical bioassays.",

    "abstract": "Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is is among those pathogens currently posing the highest threat to public health. Its host immune evasion strategy is mediated by pore-forming toxins (PFTs), among which the bicomponent {gamma}-hemolysin is one of the most common. The complexity of the porogenesis mechanism by {gamma}-hemolysin poses difficulties in the development of antivirulence therapies targeting PFTs from S. aureus, and sparse and apparently contrasting experimental data have been produced. Here, through a large set of molecular dynamics simulations at different levels of resolution, we investigate the first step of pore formation, and in particular the effect of membrane composition on the ability of{gamma} -hemolysin components, LukF and Hlg2, to steadily adhere to the lipid bilayer in the absence of proteinaceous receptors. Our simulations are in agreement with experimental data of {gamma}-hemolysin pore formation on model membranes, which are here explained on the basis of the bilayer properties. Our computational investigation suggests a possible rationale to explain experimental data on phospholipid binding to the LukF component, and to hypothesise a mechanism by which, on purely lipidic bilayers, the stable anchoring of LukF to the cell surface facilitates Hlg2 binding, through the exposure of its N-terminal region. We expect that further insights on the mechanism of transition between soluble and membrane bound-forms and on the role played by the lipid molecules will contribute to the design of antivirulence agents with enhanced efficacy against methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=76 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/479512v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (27K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f0ae5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c46688org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1277e17org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c71898_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe presence of cholesterol and unsaturated phospholipid tails facilitates the binding of{gamma} -hemolysin components, LukF and Hlg2, on model membranes.\nC_LIO_LICoarse-grained simulations show that the two components have different absorption capabilities, with LukF undergoing the most stable binding.\nC_LIO_LIThe spontaneous docking of LukF on the membrane is mediated by two distant phosphatidylcholine binding sites.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Metastatic progression of ovarian cancer through the peritoneal fluidic microenvironment is mediated predominantly by tumor cell clusters known as spheroids. Such spheroids also comprise the cells extracellular matrix (ECM). Spheroids with lumen, often seen in malignant ascites, are associated with a basement membrane (BM)-like coat. Herein, we combine microfluidics with high-speed time-lapse videography and imaging analysis to investigate the consequences of lumen formation and the BM coat on the architecture and integrity of ovarian cancer spheroids providing architectural robustness to the transitory ovarian cancer metastatic niche within constrained flow spaces. Upon transit through spatially constrained environments, lumen-less  moruloid spheroids deform followed by an incomplete and temporally extended ([~]4.8 s) recovery. The transit causes intercellular rearrangement during entry and shows susceptibility to cellular disintegration. On the other hand, lumen-containing  blastuloid spheroids exhibit minimal intra-spheroidal rearrangements. They exhibit a lower tendency for disintegration and quickly ([~]1.5 s) recover their morphology upon exit. Significantly, removing the blastuloid BM through collagenase treatment reverts the mechanical behaviors of these spheroids to those typifying their moruloid counterparts. Simulations using an experimentally calibrated Cellular Potts model predict the requirement of higher intercellular adhesion for blastuloid behavior, which we confirm through increased E-cadherin expression in blastuloid spheroids. Surprisingly, E-cadherin expression is dependent on the BM coat, elucidating the latters role in enhancing cell-cell adhesion. Our results show how spheroidal matrix engenders lumen formation and higher intercellular adhesion, in turn providing architectural robustness of the transitory ovarian cancer metastatic niche within constrained flow spaces.\n\nSignificance StatementInvestigating the mechanical and biophysical properties of disseminated ovarian cancer spheroids is instrumental to our understanding of their metastatic progression. We take a microfluidics-based approach to investigate the biophysical contributions of a key spheroidal constituent: basement membrane-like extracellular matrix, which is typical to hollow  blastuloid spheroids, distinguishing them from the solid  moruloid spheroids. We observe using high-speed videography, imaging analysis and multiscale computational modeling that the basement membrane renders blastuloid spheroids less deformable and resistant to disintegration than moruloid spheroids. We trace this function to jamming of cells between the blastuloid lumen and basement membrane, and high intercellular adhesion.",

    "abstract": "Soybean is one of the most valuable legume crops in the world with high nutritional value. Recently, the outbreak of soybean stay-green syndrome has swept the soybean production in the Huang-Huai-Hai region of China, resulting in huge yield losses, which has become an epidemic and prominent problem in soybean production. However, the cause of the stay-green syndrome remains obscure. Here, we report a novel intergeneric recombinant geminivirus which causes soybean stay-green symptoms. Viral small RNA-based screening identified a new recombinant geminvirus from field soybean stay-green samples. The complete genome sequence of the virus contains 2762 nucleotide (nt) and appears to be an intergeneric recombinant virus in which protein coding for coat protein (V1) is similar to member of genus Mastrevirus, whereas proteins coding for V2, C2, C3 are most similar to those of viruses in the Maldovirus genus, and C1 and C4 are most similar to virus in genus Begomovirus. Inoculation of the infectious clone of the recombinant geminivirus through Agrobacterium rhizogenes causes typical soybean stay-green syndrome which resembles field symptoms including delayed leaf senescence, flat pods and abnormal seeds. The recombinant geminivirus can be detected in seed coat but not in cotyledon and embryo, thus failing to be transmitted by seeds. Moreover, the genome variation and epidemiological dynamic analysis were also carried out to help the continuous epidemiological surveillance of this emerging geminivirus. Collectively, this new geminivirus is tentatively named soybean stay-green associated virus (SoSGV). Our determination of the causal agent of soybean stay-green disease will bolster efforts to develop effective management strategies to control this prevalent disease in the field.",

    "abstract": "The DNA sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential co-factor for many eukaryotic DNA metabolic enzymes. PCNA is loaded around DNA by the ATP-dependent clamp loader replication factor C (RFC), which acts at single-stranded/double-stranded DNA junctions harboring a recessed 3 end (3 ss/dsDNA junctions) and at DNA nicks. To illuminate the loading mechanism we have investigated the structure of RFC:PCNA bound to ATP{gamma}S and 3 ss/dsDNA junctions or nicked DNA using cryogenic electron microscopy. Unexpectedly, we observe open and closed PCNA conformations in the RFC:PCNA:DNA complex, revealing that PCNA can adopt an open, planar conformation that allows direct insertion of dsDNA, and indicating that PCNA ring-closure is not mechanistically coupled to ATP-hydrolysis. By resolving multiple DNA-bound states of RFC:PCNA we observe that partial melting facilitates lateral insertion into the central channel formed by RFC:PCNA. We also resolve the Rfc1 N-terminal domain and demonstrate that its single BRCT domain participates in coordinating DNA prior to insertion into the central RFC channel, which promotes PCNA loading on the lagging strand of replication forks in vitro. Combined, our data suggest a comprehensive and fundamentally revised model for the RFC-catalyzed loading of PCNA onto DNA.",

    "abstract": "PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) guide repression of transposable elements in germlines of animals. In Drosophila, piRNAs are produced from heterochromatic genomic loci, called piRNA clusters, that act as a repositories of information about genome invaders. piRNA generation by dual-strand clusters depend on the chromatin-bound Rhino-Deadlock-Cutoff (RDC) complex, which is deposited on clusters guided by piRNAs, forming a feed-forward loop in which piRNAs promote their own biogenesis. However, how piRNA clusters are formed initially, before cognate piRNAs are present, remained unknown. Here we report spontaneous de novo formation of a piRNA cluster from repetitive transgenic sequences. We show that cluster formation occurs gradually over several generations and requires continuous trans-generational transmission of small RNAs from mothers to their progeny. We discovered that maternally-supplied siRNAs are responsible for triggering de novo cluster activation in progeny. In contrast, the siRNA pathway is dispensable for cluster function after its establishment. These results revealed an unexpected cross-talk between the siRNA and piRNA pathways and suggest a mechanism for de novo formation of piRNA clusters triggered by production of siRNAs.\n\nHighlights- A transcribed repetitive transgene is spontaneously converted into dual-strand piRNA cluster\n- Establishment of piRNA cluster occurs over multiple generations and requires cytoplasmic inheritance of cognate small RNA from mothers\n- Cognate siRNAs initiate the activation of piRNA cluster, but are dispensable after its establishment",

    "abstract": "Molecular methods are increasingly used to identify species that lack conspicuous macro- or micromorphological characters. Taxonomic and ecological research teams barcode large numbers of collected voucher specimens annually. In this study we assessed the efficiency of long-read high throughput sequencing (HTS) as opposed to the traditionally used Sanger method for taxonomic identification of multiple vouchered fungal specimens, and providing reference information about intra-individual allele polymorphism. We developed a workflow based on a test-set of 423 fungal specimens (representing 205 species), PacBio HTS method, and ribosomal rRNA operon internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and 28S rRNA gene (LSU) markers. PacBio HTS had a higher success rate than Sanger sequencing at a comparable cost. Species identification based on PacBio reads was usually straightforward, because the dominant operational taxonomic unit (OTU) typically represented the targeted organism. Unlike the Sanger method, PacBio HTS enabled detecting widespread allele polymorphism within the ITS marker in the studied specimens. We conclude that multiplex DNA barcoding of the fungal ITS and LSU markers using a PacBio HTS is a useful tool for taxonomic identification of large amounts of collected voucher specimens at competitive price. Furthermore, PacBio HTS accurately recovers various alleles, which can provide crucial information for species delimitation and population-level studies.",
