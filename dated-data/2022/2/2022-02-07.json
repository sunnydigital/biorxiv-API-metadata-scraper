    "abstract": "Machine learning was shown to be effective at identifying distinctive genomic signatures among viral sequences. These signatures are defined as pervasive motifs in the viral genome that allow discrimination between species or variants. In the context of SARS-CoV-2, the identification of these signatures can assist in taxonomic and phylogenetic studies, improve in the recognition and definition of emerging variants, and aid in the characterization of functional properties of polymorphic gene products. In this paper, we assess KEVOLVE, an approach based on a genetic algorithm with a machine-learning kernel, to identify multiple genomic signatures based on minimal sets of k-mers. In a comparative study, in which we analyzed large SARS-CoV-2 genome dataset, KEVOLVE was more effective at identifying variant-discriminative signatures than several gold-standard statistical tools. Subsequently, these signatures were characterized using a new extension of KEVOLVE (KANALYZER) to highlight variations of the discriminative signatures among different classes of variants, their genomic location, and the mutations involved. The majority of identified signatures were associated with known mutations among the different variants, in terms of functional and pathological impact based on available literature. Here we showed that KEVOLVE is a robust machine learning approach to identify discriminative signatures among SARS-CoV-2 variants, which are frequently also biologically relevant, while bypassing multiple sequence alignments.

    "abstract": "Preclinical pharmacokinetics (PK) and in vitro ADME properties of GS-441524, a potential oral agent for the treatment of Covid-19, were studied. GS-441524 was stable in vitro in liver microsomes, cytosols, and hepatocytes of mice, rats, monkeys, dogs, and humans. The plasma free fractions of GS-441524 were 62-78% across all studied species. The in vitro transporter study results showed that GS-441524 was a substrate of MDR1, BCRP, CNT3, ENT1, and ENT2; but not a substrate of CNT1, CNT2, and ENT4. GS-441524 had a low to moderate plasma clearance (CLp), ranging from 4.1 mL/min/kg in dogs to 26 mL/min/kg in mice; the steady state volume distribution (Vdss) ranged from 0.9 L/kg in dogs to 2.2 L/kg in mice after IV administration. Urinary excretion appeared to be the major elimination process for GS-441524. Following oral administration, the oral bioavailability was 8.3% in monkeys, 33% in rats, 39% in mice, and 85% in dogs. The PK and ADME properties of GS-441524 support its further development as an oral drug candidate.",

    "abstract": "Omicron sub-lineage BA.2 has rapidly surged globally, accounting for over 60% of recent SARS-CoV-2 infections. Newly acquired RBD mutations and high transmission advantage over BA.1 urge the investigation of BA.2s immune evasion capability. Here, we show that BA.2 causes strong neutralization resistance, comparable to BA.1, in vaccinated individuals plasma. However, BA.2 displays more severe antibody evasion in BA.1 convalescents, and most prominently, in vaccinated SARS convalescents plasma, suggesting a substantial antigenicity difference between BA.2 and BA.1. To specify, we determined the escaping mutation profiles1,2 of 714 SARS-CoV-2 RBD neutralizing antibodies, including 241 broad sarbecovirus neutralizing antibodies isolated from SARS convalescents, and measured their neutralization efficacy against BA.1, BA.1.1, BA.2. Importantly, BA.2 specifically induces large-scale escape of BA.1/BA.1.1-effective broad sarbecovirus neutralizing antibodies via novel mutations T376A, D405N, and R408S. These sites were highly conserved across sarbecoviruses, suggesting that Omicron BA.2 arose from immune pressure selection instead of zoonotic spillover. Moreover, BA.2 reduces the efficacy of S309 (Sotrovimab)3,4 and broad sarbecovirus neutralizing antibodies targeting the similar epitope region, including BD55-5840. Structural comparisons of BD55-5840 in complexes with BA.1 and BA.2 spike suggest that BA.2 could hinder antibody binding through S371F-induced N343-glycan displacement. Intriguingly, the absence of G446S mutation in BA.2 enabled a proportion of 440-449 linear epitope targeting antibodies to retain neutralizing efficacy, including COV2-2130 (Cilgavimab)5. Together, we showed that BA.2 exhibits distinct antigenicity compared to BA.1 and provided a comprehensive profile of SARS-CoV-2 antibody escaping mutations. Our study offers critical insights into the humoral immune evading mechanism of current and future variants.",

    "abstract": "MotivationEpitope-based molecular mimicry occurs when an antibody cross-reacts with two different antigens due to structural and chemical similarities. Molecular mimicry between proteins from two viruses can lead to beneficial cross-protection when the antibodies produced by exposure to one also react with the other. On the other hand, mimicry between a protein from a pathogen and a human protein can lead to auto-immune disorders if the antibodies resulting from exposure to the virus end up interacting with host proteins. While cross-protection can suggest the possible reuse of vaccines developed for other pathogens, cross-reaction with host proteins may explain side effects. There are no computational tools available to date for a large-scale search of antibody cross-reactivity.\n\nResultsWe present a comprehensive Epitope-based Molecular Mimicry Search (EMoMiS) pipeline for computational molecular mimicry searches. EMoMiS, when applied to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein, identified eight examples of molecular mimicry with viral and human proteins. These findings provide possible explanations for (a) differential severity of COVID-19 caused by cross-protection due to prior vaccinations and/or exposure to other viruses, and (b) commonly seen COVID-19 side effects such as thrombocytopenia and thrombophilia. Our findings are supported by previously reported research but need validation with laboratory experiments. The developed pipeline is generic and can be applied to find mimicry for novel pathogens. It has applications in improving vaccine design.\n\nAvailabilityThe developed Epitope-based Molecular Mimicry Search Pipeline (EMoMiS) is available from https://biorg.cs.fiu.edu/emomis/.\n\nContactgiri@cs.fiu.edu",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy has become a core tool for visualizing and quantifying the spatial and temporal dynamics of complex biological processes. Thanks to its low cost and ease-of-use, widefield fluorescent imaging remains one of the most widely used fluorescence microscopy imaging modalities. To accomplish imaging of 3D samples, conventional fluorescence imaging entails acquiring a sequence of 2D images spaced along the z-dimension, typically called a z-stack. Oftentimes, the next step is to project the 3D volume into a single 2D image, as 3D image data can be cumbersome to manage and challenging to analyze and interpret, effectively limiting the utlity of z-dimensional information. Furthermore, z-stack acquisition is often time-consuming and consequently may induce photodamage to the biological sample, which are both major hurdles for its application in experiments that require high-throughput, such as drug screening. As an alternative to z-stacks, axial sweep acquisition schemes have been proposed to circumvent these drawbacks and offers potential of 100-fold faster image acquisition for 3D-samples compared to z-stack acquisition but unfortunately results in blurry, low-quality raw 2D z-projected images. We propose a novel workflow to combine axial z-sweep acquisition with deep learning-based image restoration, ultimately enabling high-throughput and high-quality imaging of complex 3D-samples using 2D projection images. To demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed workflow, we apply it to live-cell imaging of 3D tumor spheroids and find we can produce high-fidelity images appropriate for quantitative analysis. Therefore, we conclude that combining axial z-sweep image acquisition with deep learning-based image restoration enables high-throughput and high-quality fluorescence imaging of complex 3D biological samples.",
