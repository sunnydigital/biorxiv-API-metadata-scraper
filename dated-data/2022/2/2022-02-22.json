    "abstract": "MotivationThe advancement of high-throughput technology characterizes a wide range of epigenetic modifications across the genome involved in disease pathogenesis via regulating gene expression. The high-dimensionality of both epigenetic and gene expression data make it challenging to identify the important epigenetic regulators of genes. Conducting univariate test for each epigenetic-gene pair is subject to serious multiple comparison burden, and direct application of regularization methods to select epigenetic-gene pairs is computationally infeasible. Applying fast screening to reduce dimension first before regularization is more efficient and stable than applying regularization methods alone.\n\nResultsWe propose a novel screening method based on robust partial correlation to detect epigenetic regulators of gene expression over the whole genome, a problem that includes both high-dimensional predictors and high-dimensional responses. Compared to existing screening methods, our method is conceptually innovative that it reduces the dimension of both predictor and response, and screens at both node (epigenetic features or genes) and edge (epigenetic-gene pairs) levels. We develop data-driven procedures to determine the conditional sets and the optimal screening threshold, and implement a fast iterative algorithm. Simulations and two applications to long non-coding RNA and DNA methylation regulation in Kidney cancer and Glioblastoma Multiforme illustrate the validity and advantage of our method.\n\nAvailabilityThe R package, related source codes and real data sets used in this paper are provided at https://github.com/kehongjie/rPCor.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation of biomolecules give rise to membraneless organelles that contribute to the spatiotemporal organisation of the cell. In most cases, such biomolecular condensates contain multiple components, but the manner in which interactions between components control the stability of condensates remained challenging to elucidate. Here, we develop an approach to determine tie-line gradients in ternary liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) systems, based on measurements of the dilute phase concentration of only one component. We show that the sign of the tie-line gradient is related to the cross-interaction energy between the polymers in the system and discriminates between competitive and cooperative phase separation. Using this approach, we studied the interaction between protein Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer chains, and measured positive tie-line gradients. Our results show that PEG drives LLPS through an associative interaction with FUS and is not an inert crowder. We further studied the interaction between PolyA RNA (3.0{+/-}0.5kDa) and the protein G3BP1, and using the tie-line gradient as a reporter for the stoichiometry of polymers in the condensate we determined a G3BP1-to-PolyA RNA molar ratio of 1:4 in the dense phase. Our framework for measuring tie-line gradients opens up a route for the characterisation of interaction types and compositions in ternary LLPS systems.",

    "abstract": "Biofilm formation is the most successful survival strategy for bacterial communities. In the biofilm lifestyle, bacteria embed themselves in a self-secreted matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which acts as a shield against mechanical and chemical insults. When ambient flow is present, this viscoelastic scaffold can take a streamlined shape, forming biofilm filaments suspended in flow, called streamers. Streamers significantly disrupt the fluid flow by causing rapid clogging and affect transport in aquatic environments. Despite their relevance, the structural and rheological characterization of biofilm streamers is still at an early stage. In this work, we present a microfluidic platform that allows the reproducible growth of biofilm streamers in controlled physico-chemical conditions and the characterization of their biochemical composition, morphology, and rheology in situ. We employed isolated micropillars as nucleation sites for the growth of single biofilm streamers under the continuous flow of a diluted bacterial suspension. By combining fluorescent staining of the EPS components and epifluorescence microscopy, we were able to characterize the biochemical composition and morphology of the streamers. Additionally, we optimized a protocol to perform hydrodynamic stress tests in situ, by inducing controlled variations of the fluid shear stress exerted on the streamers by the flow. Thus, the reproducibility of the formation process and the testing protocol make it possible to perform several consistent experimental replicates that provide statistically significant information. By allowing the systematic investigation of the role of biochemical composition on the structure and rheology of streamers, this platform will advance our understanding of biofilm formation.",

    "abstract": "RNA binding proteins play important roles in the processing and precise regulation of RNAs. Highlighting the biological importance of RNA binding proteins is the increasing number of human diseases that result from mutations in genes that encode these proteins. We recently discovered that mutations in the ZC3H14 gene, which encodes an evolutionarily conserved polyadenosine RNA-binding protein, cause intellectual disability. Studies of the budding yeast orthologue of ZC3H14, Nuclear Poly(A) Binding protein 2 (Nab2), have provided insight into the functions of this protein. The NAB2 gene is essential in S. cerevisiae, and conditional nab2 mutants cause defects in a number of steps in RNA processing. To explore the critical functions of the Nab2/ZC3H14 protein family, we performed a high-copy suppressor screen on nab2 mutant cells. This screen identified genes encoding two core subunits of the RNA exosome, as well as Nrd1 and Ski7, nuclear and cytoplasmic cofactors of the RNA exosome, respectively. Nrd1 is an RNA binding protein that is part of the Nrd1-Nab3-Sen1 (NNS) complex, which plays an important role in transcription termination of non-coding RNAs. Ski7 is a GTP-binding protein that mediates interaction between the RNA exosome and the Ski complex, which targets RNA transcripts to the exosome for processing and degradation in the cytoplasm. To explore the functional interactions between the RNA exosome and Nab2, we employed RNA-seq analysis to identify the transcripts most impacted by overexpression of these exosome cofactors in nab2 mutant cells. This analysis revealed that many transcripts show small changes in steady-state levels, consistent with a global role of Nab2 in modulating transcript stability. This study uncovers functional interactions between the RNA exosome and Nab2 in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm.",

    "abstract": "Defining demographically independent units and understanding gene flow between them is essential for managing and conserving exploited populations. The scalloped hammerhead shark, Sphyrna lewini, is a coastal semi-oceanic species found worldwide in tropical and subtropical waters. Pregnant females give birth in shallow coastal estuarine habitats that serve as nursery grounds for neonates and small juveniles, and adults move offshore and become highly migratory. We evaluated the population structure and connectivity of S. lewini in coastal areas across the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP) using both sequences of the mitochondrial DNA control region (mtCR) and nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci. The mtCR defined two genetically discrete geographic groups: the Mexican Pacific and the central-southern Eastern Tropical Pacific (Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia). Overall, the mtCR data showed low levels of haplotype diversity ranged from 0.000 to 0.608, while nucleotide diversity ranged from 0.000 to 0.0015. A more fine-grade population structure analysis was detected using microsatellite loci where Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Panama differed significantly. Genetic diversity analysis with nuclear markers revealed an observed heterozygosity ranging from 0.68 to 0.71 and an allelic richness from 5.89 to 7.00. Relatedness analysis revealed that individuals within nursery areas were more closely related than expected by chance, suggesting that S. lewini may exhibit reproductive philopatric behaviour within the ETP. Findings of at least two different management units, and evidence of philopatric behaviour call for intensive conservation actions for this critically endangered species in the ETP.",
