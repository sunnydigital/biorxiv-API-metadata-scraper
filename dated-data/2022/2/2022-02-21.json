    "abstract": "The recognition that individual GPCRs can activate multiple signaling pathways has raised the possibility of developing drugs selectively targeting therapeutically relevant ones. This requires tools to determine which G proteins and {beta}arrestins are activated by a given receptor. Here, we present a set of BRET sensors monitoring the activation of the 12 G protein subtypes based on the translocation of their effectors to the plasma membrane (EMTA). Unlike most of the existing detection systems, EMTA does not require modification of receptors or G proteins (except for Gs). EMTA was found to be suitable for the detection of constitutive activity, inverse agonism, biased signaling and polypharmacology. Profiling of 100 therapeutically relevant human GPCRs resulted in 1,500 pathway-specific concentration-response curves and revealed a great diversity of coupling profiles ranging from exquisite selectivity to broad promiscuity. Overall, this work describes unique resources for studying the complexities underlying GPCR signaling and pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "Molecular barcoding techniques have emerged as powerful tools to understand microbial pathogenesis. However, barcoding strategies have not been extended to protozoan parasites, which have unique genomic structures and virulence strategies compared to viral and bacterial pathogens. Here, we present a versatile CRISPR-based method to barcode protozoa, which we successfully apply to Toxoplasma gondii and Trypanosoma brucei. The murine brain is an important transmission niche for T. gondii, and brain persistence is a clinically untreatable feature of infection. The blood-brain barrier is expected to physically restrict parasite colonization of this niche, resulting in a selection bottleneck. Using libraries of barcoded T. gondii we evaluate shifts in the population structure from acute to chronic infection of mice. Contrary to expectation, most barcodes were present in the brain one-month post-intraperitoneal infection in both inbred CBA/J and outbred Swiss mice. Although parasite cyst number and barcode diversity declined over time, barcodes that represented a minor fraction of the inoculum could become a dominant population in the brain by three months post-infection. Together, these data establish the first, robust molecular barcoding approach for protozoa and evidence that the blood-brain barrier does not represent a major bottleneck to colonization by T. gondii.",

To determine the underlying computational principles, we build a realistic computational model of a central decision module within the Drosophila mushroom body (MB), the flys center for learning and memory. Our model combines the electron microscopy-based architecture of one MB output neuron (MBON-3), the synaptic connectivity of its 948 presynaptic Kenyon cells (KCs), and its membrane properties obtained from patch-clamp recordings. We show that this neuron is electrotonically compact and that synaptic input corresponding to simulated odor input robustly drives its spiking behavior. Therefore, sparse innervation by KCs can efficiently control and modulate MBON activity in response to learning with minimal requirements on the specificity of synaptic localization. This architecture allows efficient storage of large numbers of memories using the flexible stochastic connectivity of the circuit.",

Since BDD is prone to misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER protein misfolding in hepatocytes followed by high fat diet (HFD) can cause hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we studied how FVIII misfolding impacts HCC development using hepatocyte DNA delivery to express three proteins from the same parental vector: 1) well-folded cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR); 2) BDD-FVIII, which is prone to misfolding in the ER; and 3) N6-FVIII which folds more efficiently than BDD-FVIII. One week after DNA delivery, when FVIII expression was undetectable, mice were fed HFD for 65 weeks. Remarkably, all mice that received BDD-FVIII vector developed liver tumors, whereas only 58% of mice that received N6 and no mice that received DHFR vector developed liver tumors, suggesting that the degree of protein misfolding in the ER increases predisposition to HCC in the context of a HFD and in the absence of viral transduction. Our findings raise concerns of ectopic BDD-FVIII expression in hepatocytes in the clinic, which poses risks independent of viral vector integration. Limited expression per hepatocyte and/or use of proteins that avoid misfolding may enhance safety.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "BackgroundImproving feed efficiency has become a common target for dairy farmers to meet the requirement of producing more milk with fewer resources. To improve feed efficiency, a prerequisite is to ensure that the cows identified as most or least efficient will remain as such, independently of diet composition. Therefore, the current research analysed the ability of lactating dairy cows to maintain their feed efficiency while changing the energy density of the diet by changing its concentration in starch and fibre. A total of 60 lactating Holstein cows, including 33 primiparous cows, were first fed a high starch diet-low fibre (diet S+F-), then switched over to a low starch diet-high fibre (diet S-F+). To know if diet affect feed efficiency, we compared the ability of feed efficiency to be maintained within a diet over subsequent lactation stages, known as repeatability of feed efficiency, with its ability to be maintained across diets, known as reproducibility of feed efficiency. To do so we used two indicators: the estimation of the error of repeatability/reproducibility, which is commonly used in metrology, and the coefficient of correlation of concordance (CCC), which is used in biology. The effect of diet change could also lead to a change in cows sorting behaviour which could potentially affect feed efficiency if for example the most efficient cows select more concentrate than the least efficient. We therefore analysed the relationship between the differences in individual feed refusals composition and the differences in feed efficiency. To do so, the composition of each feed refusal was described with its near infra-red (NIR) spectroscopy and was performed on each individual feed ingredient, diet and refusals and used as composition variable. The variability of the NIR spectra of the refusals was described with its principal components thanks to a principal component analysis (PCA). The Pearson correlation was estimated to check the relationship between feed efficiency and refusals composition, i.e. sorting behaviour.\n\nResultsThe error of reproducibility of feed efficiency across diets was 2.95 MJ/d. This error was significantly larger than the errors of repeatability estimated within diet, which were 2.01 MJ/d within diet S-F+ and 2.40 MJ/d within diet S+F-. The CCC was 0.64 between feed efficiency estimated within diet S+F- and feed efficiency estimated within diet S-F+. This CCC was smaller than the one observed for feed efficiency estimated within diet between two subsequent lactation stages (CCC = 0.72 within diet S+F- and 0.85 within diet S-F+). Feed efficiency was poorly correlated to the first two principal components, which explained 90% of the total variability of the NIR spectra of the individual refusals. This suggests that feed sorting behaviour did not explain differences in feed efficiency.\n\nConclusionsFeed efficiency was significantly less reproducible across diets than repeatable within the same diet over subsequent lactation stages, but cows ranking for feed efficiency was not significantly affected by diet change. This loss in repeatability across diets could be due to a more pronounced feed sorting subsequent to the change in diet composition. However, the differences in sorting behaviour between cows were not associated to feed efficiency differences in this trial neither with the S+F- diet nor with the S-F+ diet. Those results have to be confirmed on diets having different forage to concentrate ratios to ensure that the least and most efficient cows will not change.",

    "abstract": "A chromosomal translocation found in cannibalistic acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leads to an in-frame fusion of the transcription elongation repressor ZMYND11 to MBTD1, a subunit of the NuA4/TIP60 histone acetyltransferase (HAT) complex. In contrast to the NuA4/TIP60 complex, ZMYND11 is linked to repression of actively transcribed genes through recognition of H3.3K36me3. To understand the abnormal molecular events that expression of this ZMYND11-MBTD1 fusion protein can create, we performed its biochemical and functional characterization in comparison to each individual fusion partner. ZMYND11-MBTD1 is stably incorporated into the endogenous NuA4/TIP60 complex but does not bring any additional interactors as the fusion lacks the MYND domain of ZMYND11. Nevertheless, this truncated ZMYND11 moiety in the fusion leads to mislocalization of the NuA4/TIP60 complex on the body of genes normally bound by ZMYND11 in the genome, in a PWWP-H3.3K36me3 interaction-dependent manner. This can be correlated to increased chromatin acetylation and altered gene transcription, most notably on the MYC oncogene, and alternative splicing. Importantly, expression of ZMYND11-MBTD1, but not the individual fusion partners, during embryonic stem cell differentiation, leads to decreased expression of specific differentiation markers, while favoring Myc-driven pluripotency. It also favors self-renewal of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells. Altogether, these results indicate that the ZMYND11-MBTD1 fusion protein functions primarily by mistargeting the NuA4/TIP60 complex to the body of genes, altering normal transcription of specific genes, likely driving oncogenesis in part through the Myc regulatory network.\n\nHighlights-A recurrent chromosomal translocation detected in cannibalistic acute myeloid leukemia leads to the production of a ZMYND11-MBTD1 fusion protein.\n-The ZMYND11-MBTD1 fusion protein is stably incorporated into the endogenous NuA4/TIP60 complex.\n-ZMYND11-MBTD1 leads to mistargeting of NuA4/TIP60 activity to the coding region of ZMYND11-target genes, altering gene expression and splicing.\n-ZMYND11-MBTD1 binds the MYC gene leading to its upregulation, favoring growth and pluripotency while inhibiting differentiation markers.",

    "abstract": "The Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) is a developmental cellular program frequently coopted by cancer cells1 and is a key contributor to both heterogeneity in solid tumors2-4 and later stage chemo-resistance and metastasis5,6. Rather than being a switch from an epithelial to a mesenchymal state, increasing evidence points to the existence of intermediate EMT states, wherein cells co-express both epithelial and mesenchymal traits7-13. Multiple stable intermediate EMT states possessing unique characteristics exist across the EMT spectrum7,8,14,15, contributing to the complex heterogeneity of tumors to promote metastasis16. While much work has been carried out identifying and characterizing EMT-inducing transcription factors17-20, the transcriptional and epigenetic networks responsible for the stability and maintenance of the midpoints along the EMT spectrum are poorly defined. In addition, there are currently no approaches to identifying and quantifying intermediate EMT subpopulations within patient tumors to evaluate their prognostic significance. Using clonally isolated derivatives of the SUM149PT breast cancer cell line, we systematically interrogate how each EMT state independently contributes to heterogeneity and influences metastatic progression, uncovering the role of RUNX2 in stabilizing certain intermediate states. Using SUM149PT-derived tumors as a training set, we develop an entropy-based model to quantify phenotypic heterogeneity and EMT status. Remarkably, the majority of cell states captured in the SUM149PT model are represented in a selection of patient tumors, laying the foundation for quantification of epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity and understanding the role of the intermediate EMT state in tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "Microbial phosphonate biosynthetic machinery has been identified in ~5% of bacterial genomes and encodes natural products like fosfomycin as well as cell surface decorations. Almost all biological phosphonates originate from the rearrangement of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to phosphonopyruvate (PnPy) catalyzed by PEP mutase (Ppm), and PnPy is often converted to phosphonoacetaldehyde (PnAA) by PnPy decarboxylase (Ppd). Seven enzymes are known or likely to act on either PnPy or PnAA as early branch points en route to diverse biosynthetic outcomes, and these enzymes may be broadly classified into three reaction types: hydride transfer, aminotransfer, and carbon-carbon bond formation. However, the relative abundance of these branch points in microbial phosphonate biosynthesis is unknown. Also unknown is the proportion of ppm-containing gene neighborhoods encoding new branch point enzymes and potentially novel phosphonates. In this study we computationally sorted 434 ppm-containing gene neighborhoods based on these seven branch point enzymes. Unsurprisingly, the majority (56%) of these pathways encode for production of the common naturally occurring compound 2-aminoethylphosphonate (AEP) or a hydroxylated derivative. The next most abundant genetically encoded intermediates were phosphonoalanine (PnAla, 9.2%), 2-hydroxyethylphosphonate (HEP, 8.5%), and phosphonoacetate (PnAc, 6%). Significantly, about 13% of the gene neighborhoods could not be assigned to any of the seven branch points and may encode novel phosphonates. Sequence similarity network analysis revealed families of unusual gene neighborhoods including possible production of phosphonoacrylate and phosphonofructose, the apparent biosynthetic use of the C-P lyase operon, and a virus-encoded phosphonate. Overall, these results highlight the utility of branch point inventories to identify novel gene neighborhoods and guide future phosphonate discovery efforts.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTMicrobially-produced phosphonates are relatively rare and underexplored but include medically and agriculturally important molecules like fosfomycin and phosphinothricin, respectively. Because a single enzyme called phosphoenolpyruvate mutase (Ppm) inititates almost all phosphonate production, the composition of the  gene neighborhood surrounding a Ppm-encoding gene can inform hypotheses regarding the chemical output of this chromosomal region. After the initial Ppm-catalyzed reaction there are only a limited set of subsequently acting enzymes, or  branch points, to direct these early-stage phosphonates to alternate chemical fates. However, the relative abundance of different branch points - or the existence of new ones - has not been evaluated. This study provides just such a  branch point inventory to determine relative proportions of known branch points and assess the diversity within each branch point. Significantly, this study suggests that a significant proportion (~13%) of gene neighborhoods do not fit into known branch points and therefore may be fertile hunting grounds for new phosphonate biochemistry.\n\nData SummarySupporting information is available at Scholars Portal Dataverse (https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/) with DOI 10.5683/SP2/T33ZP6.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWFungal pathogens represent a serious threat towards agriculture, health, and environment. Control of fungal diseases on crops necessitates a global understanding of fungal pathogenicity determinants and their expression during infection. Genomes of phytopathogenic fungi are often compartmentalized: the core genome contains housekeeping genes whereas the fast-evolving genome mainly contains transposable elements and species-specific genes. In this study, we analysed nucleosome landscapes of four phytopathogenic fungi with contrasted genome organizations to describe and compare nucleosome repartition patterns in relation with genome structure and gene expression level. We combined MNase-seq and RNA-seq analyses to concomitantly map nucleosome-rich and transcriptionally active regions during fungal growth in axenic culture; we developed the MNase-seq Tool Suite (MSTS) to analyse and visualise data obtained from MNase-seq experiments in combination with other genomic data and notably RNA-seq expression data. We observed different characteristics of nucleosome profiles between species, as well as between genomic regions within the same species. We further linked nucleosome repartition and gene expression. Our findings support that nucleosome positioning and occupancies are subjected to evolution, in relation with underlying genome sequence modifications. Understanding genomic organization and its role in expression regulation is the next gear to understand complex cellular mechanisms and their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Metabolic oscillations are characterized by alternating phases of high and low respiratory activity, associated with transcription of genes involved in biosynthetic pathways and growth, and in catabolism and stress response. However, the functional consequences of transcriptome oscillations remain unclear, since most proteins are too stable to be affected by oscillatory transcript abundances. In this work, we investigate a transcriptome time series during an unstable state of the oscillation. Our analyses confirm previous suggestions that the relative times spent in the alternative transcription states are coupled to growth rate. This pulse-width modulation of transcription provides a simple mechanism for the long-standing question of how cells adjust their ribosome content and growth rate to environmental conditions. A mathematical model of this idea reproduces both the almost linear relation of transcript and protein abundances and the non-linear relation of oscillation periods to growth rate.",

    "abstract": "The Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infects almost 95% of the population worldwide. While typically asymptomatic, EBV latent infection is associated with several malignancies of epithelial and lymphoid origin in immunocompromised individuals. In latently infected cells, the EBV genome persists as a chromatinized episome that expresses a limited set of viral genes in different patterns, referred to as latency types, which coincide with varying stages of infection and various malignancies. We have previously demonstrated that latency types correlate with differences in the composition and structure of the EBV episome. Several cellular factors, including the nuclear lamina, regulate chromatin composition and architecture. While the interaction of the viral genome with the nuclear lamina has been studied in the context of EBV lytic reactivation, the role of the nuclear lamina in controlling EBV latency has not been investigated. Here, we report that the nuclear lamina is an essential epigenetic regulator of the EBV episome. We observed that in B cells, EBV infection affects the composition of the nuclear lamina by inducing the expression of lamin A/C, but only in EBV+ cells expressing the Type III latency program. Using ChIP-Seq, we determined that lamin B1 and lamin A/C bind the EBV genome, and their binding correlates with deposition of the histone repressive mark H3K9me2. By RNA-Seq, we observed that knock-out of lamin A/C in B cells alters EBV gene expression. Our data indicate that the interaction between lamins and the EBV episome contributes to the epigenetic control of viral gene expression during latency, suggesting a restrictive function of the nuclear lamina as part of the host response against viral DNA entry into the nucleus.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a common herpesvirus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in a small fraction of B cells of the infected individuals. In most cases, EBV infection is asymptomatic; however, especially in the context of immune suppression, EBV latent infection is associated with several malignancies. In EBV+ cancer cells, latent viral gene expression plays an essential role in sustaining the cancer phenotype. We and others have established that epigenetic modifications of the viral genome are critical to regulating EBV gene expression during latency. Understanding how the EBV genome is epigenetically regulated during latent infection may help identify new specific therapeutic targets for treating EBV+ malignancies. The nuclear lamina is involved in regulating the composition and structure of the cellular chromatin. In the present study, we determined that the nuclear lamina binds the EBV genome during latency, influencing viral gene expression. Depleting one component of the nuclear lamina, lamin A/C, increased the expression of latent EBV genes associated with cellular proliferation, indicating that the binding of the nuclear lamina with the viral genome is essential to control viral gene expression in infected cells. Our data show for the first time that the nuclear lamina may be involved in the cellular response against EBV infection by restricting viral gene expression.",

It is frequently convenient to characterize DNA molecules using a label-free approach such as ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy. In this paper we present the results of our investigation into the use of this technique to probe the folding of quadruplex and triplex nanoswitches. We confirmed that four G-quartets were necessary for folding at sub-mM concentrations of potassium and found that the wrong choice of sequence for the linker between G-tracts could dramatically disrupt folding, presumably due to the presence of kinetic traps in the folding landscape. In the case of the triplex nanoswitch we examined, we found that the UV spectrum showed a small change in absorbance when a triplex was formed. We anticipate that our results will be of interest to researchers seeking to design DNA nanoswitches based on quadruplexes and triplexes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIUltraviolet absorption spectroscopy can probe non-canonical DNA structures.\nC_LIO_LIAbsorbance at 295nm tends to increase as G-quadruplexes form.\nC_LIO_LIFour G-quartets are needed to form a quadruplex with less than 1mM potassium.\nC_LIO_LIFormation of DNA triplexes can also yield a small change in UV spectra.\nC_LIO_LIUV absorption is a cheap label-free method for studying DNA nanoswitches.\nC_LI",

These antibodies bind to regions on the antibody called epitopes. Structural similarity (molecular mimicry) of epitopes between an infecting pathogen and host proteins or other pathogenic proteins the host has previously encountered can impact the host immune response to the pathogen and may lead to cross-reactive antibodies. The ability to identify potential regions of molecular mimicry in a pathogen can illuminate immune effects which are especially important to pathogen treatment and vaccine design. Here we present Epitopedia, a software pipeline that facilitates the identification of regions that may exhibit potential three-dimensional molecular mimicry between an antigenic pathogen protein and known immune epitopes as catalogued by the immune epitope database (IEDB). Epitopedia is open-source software released under the MIT license and is freely available on GitHub, including a Docker container with all other software dependencies preinstalled. We performed an analysis describing how various secondary structure states, identity between pentapeptide pairs, and identity between the parent sequences of pentapeptide pairs affects RMSD. We found that pentapeptides pairs in a helical conformation had considerably lower RMSD values than those in Extended or Coil conformations. We also found that RMSD is significantly increased when pentapeptide pairs are from non-homologous sequences.",

    "abstract": "Species endemic to restricted geographical ranges represent a particular conservation issue, be it for their heritage interest. In a context of global change, this is particularly the case for plants which belong to high-mountain ecosystems and, because of their ecological requirements, are doomed to survive or disappear on their  sky islands. The Pyrenean Larkspur (Delphinium montanum, Ranunculaceae) is endemic to the Eastern part of the Pyrenees (France and Spain). It is now only observable at a dozen of localities and some populations show signs of decline, such as a recurrent lack of flowering. Implementing population genomic approach (e.g. RAD-seq like) is particularly useful to understand genomic patterns of diversity and differentiation in order to provide recommendations in term of conservation. However, it remains challenging for species such as D. montanum that are autotetraploid with a large genome size (1C-value > 10 pg) as most methods currently available were developed for diploid species. A Bayesian framework able to call genotypes with uncertainty allowed us to assess genetic diversity and population structure in this system. Our results show evidence for inbreeding (mean GIS = 0.361) within all the populations and substantial population structure (mean GST = 0.403) at the metapopulation level. In addition to a lack of connectivity between populations, spatial projections of Ecological Niche Modelling analyses under different climatic scenarios predict a dramatic decrease of suitable habitat for D. montanum in the future. Based on these results, we discuss the relevance and feasibility of different conservation measures.",

It is currently unknown how the clock regulates expression of homoeologous genes in polyploids. Here, we generate a high-resolution time-course dataset to investigate the circadian balance between sets of three homoeologous genes (triads) from hexaploid bread wheat. We find a large proportion of circadian triads exhibit imbalanced rhythmic expression patterns, with no specific sub-genome favoured. In wheat, period lengths of rhythmic transcripts are found to be longer and have a higher level of variance than in other plant species. Expression of transcripts associated with circadian controlled biological processes are largely conserved between wheat and Arabidopsis, however striking differences are seen in agriculturally critical processes such as starch metabolism. Together, this work highlights the ongoing selection for balance versus diversification in circadian homoeologs, and identifies clock-controlled pathways that might provide important targets for future wheat breeding.",

Examining the relationship between individual differences in brain organization and cognitive function in healthy older adults can help us understand how these networks support healthy cognitive aging. We investigated functional network segregation in 146 cognitively healthy participants aged 85+ in the McKnight Brain Aging Registry. We found that the segregation of the cortical association system and the segregation of individual networks within that system [the fronto-parietal network (FPN), cingulo-opercular network (CON) and default mode network (DMN)], were strong predictors of overall cognition and processing speed. We also provide a healthy oldest-old (85+) cortical parcellation that can be used in future work in this age group. This study shows that network segregation of the oldest-old brain is closely linked to cognitive performance. This work adds to the growing body of knowledge about differentiation in the aged brain by demonstrating that cognitive ability is associated with differentiated functional networks in very old individuals experiencing successful cognitive aging.",

    "abstract": "Endotoxin - bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - is a driver of the lethal infection sepsis through activation of innate immune responses. When delivered to the cytosol of macrophages, LPS (cLPS) induces the assembly of an inflammasome that contains caspases-4/5 in humans or caspase-11 in mice. Whereas activation of all other inflammasomes is triggered by sensing of pathogen products by a specific host cytosolic pattern recognition receptor protein, whether pattern recognition receptors for cLPS exist has been doubted by many investigators, as caspases-4, -5, and -11 bind and activate LPS directly in vitro. Here we show that the primate-specific protein NLRP11 is a pattern recognition receptor for cLPS required for efficient activation of the caspase-4 inflammasome in human macrophages. NLRP11 is present in humans and other primates, but absent in mice, likely explaining why it has been missed in screens looking for innate immune signaling molecules, most of which have been carried out in mice. NLRP11 is a previously missing link and a component of the human caspase-4 inflammasome activation pathway.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryDiscovery that human macrophages contain a cytosolic receptor for bacterial lipopolysaccharide.",

Here, we demonstrate that this canonical model for PSFs is equivalent to a well-studied model from evolutionary game theory, and use this equivalence to characterize the dynamics with an arbitrary number of plant species. Surprisingly, we find that coexistence of more than two species is virtually impossible, suggesting that alternative theoretical frameworks are needed to describe feedbacks observed in diverse natural communities.

One of the prominent features of behavioral persistence is that its maturation occurs relatively late in development. This is presumed to echo the developmental time course of a corresponding circuit within late-maturing parts of the brain, such as the prefrontal cortex, but the specific identity of the responsible circuits is unknown. Here, we describe the maturation of the projection from layer 5 neurons of the prefrontal cortex to the dorsal raphe nucleus in mice. We show using pathway-specific optogenetic stimulation that this connection undergoes a dramatic increase in synaptic potency between postnatal weeks 3 and 8, corresponding to the transition from juvenile to adult. We then show that this period corresponds to an increase in the behavioral persistence that mice exhibit in a foraging task. Finally, we use genetic targeting to selectively ablate this pathway in adulthood and show that mice revert to a behavioral phenotype similar to juveniles. These results suggest that the prefrontal to dorsal raphe pathway is a critical anatomical and functional substrate of the development and manifestation of behavioral control.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 Envelope (Env) proteins designed to induce neutralizing antibody responses allow study of the role of affinities (equilibrium dissociation constant, KD) and kinetic rates (association/dissociation rates) on B cell antigen recognition. It is unclear whether affinity discrimination during B cell activation is based solely on Env protein binding KD, and whether B cells discriminate between proteins of similar affinities but that bind with different kinetic rates. Here we used a panel of Env proteins and Ramos B cell lines expressing IgM BCRs with specificity for CD4 binding-site broadly neutralizing (bnAb) or a precursor antibody to study the role of antigen binding kinetic rates on both early (proximal/distal signaling) and late events (BCR/antigen internalization) in B cell activation. Our results support a kinetic model for B cell activation in which Env protein affinity discrimination is based not on overall KD, but on sensing of association rate and a threshold antigen-BCR half-life.",

    "abstract": "Excitable cells can convert electrical signals into chemical outputs to facilitate the active transport of information across larger distances. This electrical-to-chemical conversion requires a tightly regulated expression of ion channels. Alterations of ion channel expression provide landmarks of numerous pathological diseases, such as cardiac arrhythmia, epilepsy, or cancer. Although the activity of ion channels can be locally regulated by external light or chemical stimulus, it remains challenging to coordinate the expression of ion channels on extended spatial-temporal scales in a non-invasive manner. Here, we have engineered yeast S. cerevisiae to read and convert local chemical concentrations into a dynamic electrical field distributed across cell populations. The core mechanism encodes a chemically-excitable dual-feedback gene circuit that precisely tunes the expression domain of potassium channels, globally coordinating cyclic firing of the plasma membrane potential (PMP). We demonstrate that this mechanism leverages an engineered constitutively open bacterial potassium channel KcsA to directly couple chemical stimuli with ion flux through gene expression and it can interface with the host ion channels through the pulsatile production of toxins. Our study provides a robust synthetic transcriptional toolbox underlying the conversion of local chemical environments into spatiotemporally organized electrical impulses for various cellular engineering, synthetic biology, and potential therapeutic applications.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis remains a poorly understood aspect of cancer biology and the leading cause of cancer-related death, yet most preclinical cancer studies do not examine metastasis, focusing solely on the primary tumor. One major factor contributing to this paradox is a gap in available tools for accurate spatiotemporal measurements of metastatic spread in vivo. Our objective was to develop an imaging reporter system that offers sensitive three-dimensional detection of cancer cells at high resolutions in live mice. We utilized organic anion-transporting polypeptide lb3 (oatp1b3) as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reporter gene to this end, and systematically optimized its framework for in vivo tracking of viable cancer cells in a spontaneous metastasis model. We were able to image metastasis on oatp1b3-MRI at the single lymph node level and continued to track its progression over time as cancer cells spread to multiple lymph nodes and different organ systems in single animals. While initial single lesions were successfully imaged in parallel via bioluminescence, later metastases were obscured by light scatter from the initial node. Importantly, we demonstrate and validate that 100-m isotropic resolution MR images could detect micrometastases in lung tissue estimated to contain fewer than 103 cancer cells. In summary, oatp1b3-MRI enables precise determination of lesion size and location over time and offers a path towards deep-tissue tracking of any oatp1b3-engineered cell type with combined high resolution, high sensitivity, 3D spatial information, and surrounding anatomical context.",

    "abstract": "Members of the bacterial T6SS amidase effector (Tae) superfamily of toxins are delivered between competing bacteria to degrade cell wall peptidoglycan. Although Taes share a common substrate, they exhibit distinct antimicrobial potency across different competitor species. To investigate the molecular basis governing these differences, we quantitatively defined the functional determinants of Tae1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and a high-throughput in vivo genetic approach called deep mutational scanning (DMS). As expected, combined analyses confirmed the role of critical residues near the Tae1 catalytic center. Unexpectedly, DMS revealed substantial contributions to enzymatic activity from a much larger, ring-like functional hot spot extending around the entire circumference of the enzyme. Comparative DMS across distinct growth conditions highlighted how functional contribution of different surfaces is highly context-dependent, varying alongside composition of targeted cell walls. These observations suggest that Tae1 engages with the intact cell wall network through a more distributed three-dimensional interaction interface than previously appreciated, providing an explanation for observed differences in antimicrobial potency across divergent Gram-negative competitors. Further binding studies of several Tae1 variants with their cognate immunity protein demonstrate that requirements to maintain protection from Tae activity may be a significant constraint on the mutational landscape of tae1 toxicity in the wild. In total, our work reveals that Tae diversification has likely been shaped by multiple independent pressures to maintain interactions with binding partners that vary across bacterial species and conditions.",

However, whether and how the functional connectome individual variability architecture is structurally constrained remains largely unknown. Using tractography- and morphometry-based network models, we observed the spatial convergence of structural and functional connectome individual variability, with higher variability in heteromodal association regions and lower variability in primary regions. We demonstrated that functional variability is significantly predicted by a unifying structural variability pattern and that this prediction follows a primary-to-heteromodal hierarchical axis, with higher accuracy in primary regions and lower accuracy in heteromodal regions. We further decomposed group-level connectome variability patterns into individual unique contributions and uncovered the structural-functional correspondence that is associated with individual cognitive traits. These results advance our understanding of the structural basis of individual functional variability and suggest the importance of integrating multimodal connectome signatures for individual differences in cognition and behaviors.",

    "abstract": "For many nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes, mRNA localizes to the mitochondrial surface co-translationally, aided by the association of a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) on the nascent peptide with the mitochondrial import complex. For a subset of these co-translationally localized mRNAs, their localization is dependent on the metabolic state of the cell, while others are constitutively localized. To explore the differences between these two mRNA types we developed a stochastic, quantitative model for MTS-mediated mRNA localization to mitochondria in yeast cells. This model includes translation, applying gene-specific kinetics derived from experimental data; and diffusion in the cytosol. Even though both mRNA types are co-translationally localized we found that the steady state number, or density, of ribosomes along an mRNA was insufficient to differentiate the two mRNA types. Instead, conditionally-localized mRNAs have faster translation kinetics which modulate localization in combination with changes to diffusive search kinetics across metabolic states. Our model also suggests that the MTS requires a maturation time to become competent to bind mitochondria. Our work indicates that yeast cells can regulate mRNA localization to mitochondria by controlling mitochondrial volume fraction (influencing diffusive search times) and gene translation kinetics (adjusting mRNA binding competence) without the need for mRNA-specifc binding proteins. These results shed light on both global and gene-specific mechanisms that enable cells to alter mRNA localization in response to changing metabolic conditions.",

ABPP has proven invaluable for profiling enzymatic inhibitors in drug discovery.

ABPP can also be applied to pharmacodynamic studies to inform on cellular target engagement within specific organs when applied to in vivo models. Recently, we established separate high depth and high throughput ABPP (ABPP-HT) protocols for the profiling of deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs). However, the combination of the two, deep and fast, in one method has been elusive. To further increase the sensitivity of the current ABPP-HT workflow we implemented state-of-the-art data-independent acquisition (DIA) and data-dependent acquisition (DDA) MS analysis tools. Hereby, we describe an improved methodology, ABPP-HT* (enhanced high-throughput-compatible activity-based protein profiling), that in combination with DIA MS methods allowed for the consistent profiling of 35-40 DUBs and provided a reduced number of missing values, whilst maintaining a throughput of 100 samples per day.",

Most tumors, including tumors of the endocrine system, exhibit an increased consumption of glucose to fuel cancer progression, and some cancers meet this high glucose requirement by metabolizing glycogen. Our goal was to determine if ATC cells metabolize glycogen and if this could be exploited for treatment. We detected glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase (PYG) isoforms in normal thyroid and thyroid cancer cell lines and patient-derived biopsy samples. Inhibition of PYG using CP-91,149 induced apoptosis in ATC cells but not normal thyroid cells. CP-91,149 decreased NADPH levels and induced reactive oxygen species accumulation. CP-91,149 severely blunted ATC tumor growth in vivo. Our work establishes glycogen metabolism as a novel metabolic process in thyroid cells that presents a unique, oncogenic target that could offer an improved clinical outcome.\n\nSignificanceGlycogen metabolism plays an important role in combating reactive oxygen species and apoptosis in anaplastic thyroid cancer. Glycogen phosphorylase was inhibited with small molecule inhibitors that limited cell proliferation in vitro and blunted tumor growth in a nude mouse xenograft.

    "abstract": "Endocytosis through Drosophila glia is a significant determinant of sleep amount and occurs preferentially during sleep in glia of the blood brain barrier (BBB). To identify metabolites whose trafficking is mediated by sleep-dependent endocytosis, we conducted metabolomic analysis of flies that have increased sleep due to a block in glial endocytosis. We report that acylcarnitines, molecules that conjugate with long chain fatty acids to promote their transport, accumulate in heads of these animals. In parallel, to identify transporters and receptors whose loss contributes to the sleep phenotype caused by blocked endocytosis, we screened genes enriched in barrier glia for effects on sleep. We find that knockdown of lipid transporters LRP1&2 as well as carnitine transporters ORCT1&2 increases sleep. In support of the idea that the block in endocytosis affects trafficking through specific transporters, knockdown of LRP or ORCT transporters also increases acylcarnitines in heads. We propose that lipid species, such as acylcarnitines, are trafficked through the BBB via sleep-dependent endocytosis, and their accumulation in the brain increases the need for sleep.",

    "abstract": "Of the sources of noise which affect BOLD fMRI, respiration and cardiac fluctuations are responsible for the largest part of the variance, particularly at high and ultra-high field. Existing approaches to removing physiological noise either use external recordings, which can be unwieldy and unreliable, or attempt to identify physiological noise from the magnitude fMRI data. Data-driven approaches are limited by sensitivity, temporal aliasing and the need for user interaction. In the light of the sensitivity of the phase of the MR signal to local changes in the field stemming from physiological processes, we have developed an unsupervised physiological noise correction method which uses the information carried in both the phase and the magnitude of EPI data. Our technique, Physiological Regressor Estimation from Phase and mAgnItude, sub-tR (PREPAIR) derives time series signals which are sampled at the slice TR from both phase and magnitude images. It allows physiological noise to be captured without aliasing, and efficiently removes other sources of signal fluctuations which are not related to physiology, prior to regressor estimation. We demonstrate that the physiological signal time courses identified with PREPAIR not only agree well with those from external devices, but also retrieve challenging cardiac dynamics. The removal of physiological noise was as effective as that achieved with the most commonly used approach based on external recordings, RETROICOR. In comparison with widely used physiological noise correction tools which do not use external signals, PESTICA and FIX, PREPAIR removed more respiratory and cardiac noise and achieved a larger increase in tSNR at both 3 T and 7 T.",

    "abstract": "The toxic gain of function of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) associated with the neurodegenerative disease - Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), is believed to occur via misfolding and/or aggregation. SOD1 is also associated with stress granules (SGs) which are a type of membraneless organelle believed to form via liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of several proteins containing low-complexity, disordered regions. Using a combination of experiments and computer simulations, we report here that structural disorder in two loop regions of SOD1 induced by the absence of metal cofactor - Zn, triggers its LLPS. The phase-separated droplets give rise to aggregates which eventually form toxic amyloids upon prolonged incubation. The addition of exogenous Zn to immature, metal-free SOD1 and the severe ALS mutant - I113T, stabilized the loops and restored the folded structure, thereby inhibiting LLPS and subsequent aggregation. In contrast, the Zn-induced inhibition of LLPS and aggregation was found to be partial in the case of another severe ALS-associated mutant - G85R, which exhibits reduced Zn-binding. Moreover, a less-severe ALS mutant - G37R with perturbed Cu binding does not undergo LLPS. In conclusion, our work establishes a role for Zn-dependent modulation of SOD1 disorder and LLPS as a precursor phenomenon which may lead to the formation of toxic amyloids associated with ALS.\n\nSignificance StatementThe formation of membraneless organelles such as stress granules (SGs) is believed to occur through the process of liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and involves numerous proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions. Whether SOD1, which is also associated with SGs and whose aggregation is associated with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), can independently undergo LLPS, is not known. SOD1 is a metalloenzyme which is stabilized by the metal co-factor - Zn. In this work, we utilize experimental and simulation techniques to highlight the modulation of SOD1 LLPS propensity in a Zn-dependent manner due to underlying conformational transitions between folded and partially disordered states. Our work establishes a link between SOD1 LLPS and aggregation, which is relevant to ALS pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Over the last two decades, the human reference genome has undergone multiple updates as we complete a linear representation of our genome. There are two versions of human references currently used in the biomedical literature, GRCh37/hg19 and GRCh38, and conversions between these versions are critical for quality control, imputation, and association analysis. In the present study we show that genomic coordinates for single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in regions inverted between different builds of the reference genome are erroneously converted by the TOPMed imputation server. Depending on the array type, we estimate the inappropriate conversions of variant coordinates would occur in about 2-5 Mb of the genome. Independent of the imputation server, however, in-house conversions of variant coordinates are routine yet impact of mapped variants to these inverted regions and its downstream analytical consequences are underrecognized. We observed that errors for palindromic variants in these inverted regions cannot be detected by standard quality control procedures and destabilize the local haplotype structure, leading to loss of imputation accuracy and power in association analyses. Though only a small proportion of the genome is affected, we show that these regions include important disease susceptibility variants that would be lost due to poor imputation. For example, we show that a known locus associated with prostate cancer on chr10 would have its association P-value drop from 2.86x10-7 to 0.0011 in a case-control analysis of 20,286 Africans and African Americans (10,643 cases and 9,643 controls). We devise a straight-forward heuristic based on the popular tool liftOver that can easily detect and correct these variants in the inverted regions between genome builds to locally improve imputation accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in high-density neurophysiological tools now make it possible to record from hundreds of single neurons within local, highly interconnected neural networks. Among the many advantages of such recordings is that they dramatically increase the quantity of identifiable, functional connections between neurons thereby providing an unprecedented view of local circuit interactions. Using high-density, Neuropixels recordings from single neocortical columns of primary visual cortex in nonhuman primates, we identified 1000s of functionally connected neuronal pairs using established crosscorrelation approaches. Our results reveal clear and systematic variations in the strength and synchrony of functional connections across the cortical column. Despite neurons residing within the same column, both measures of functional connectivity depended heavily on the vertical distance separating neuronal pairs, as well as on the similarity of stimulus tuning. In addition, we leveraged the statistical power afforded by the large numbers of connected pairs to categorize functional connections between neurons based on their crosscorrelation functions. These analyses identified distinct, putative classes of functional connections within the full population. These classes of functional connections were corroborated by their unique distributions across defined laminar compartments and were consistent with known properties of V1 cortical circuitry, such as the lead-lag relationship between simple and complex cells. Our results provide a clear proof-of-principle for the use of high-density neurophysiological recordings to assess circuit-level interactions within local neuronal networks.",

    "abstract": "Stroke is a devastating disease that results in neurological deficits and represents a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Following a stroke, there is a degree of spontaneous recovery of function, the neural basis of which is of great interest among clinicians in their efforts to reduce disability following stroke and enhance rehabilitation. Conventionally, work on spontaneous recovery has tended to focus on the neural reorganization of motor cortical regions, with comparably little attention being paid to changes in non-motor regions and how these relate to recovery. Here we show, using structural neuroimaging in a macaque stroke model and by exploiting individual differences in spontaneous behavioural recovery, that the preservation of regions in the sensory and association cortices predict animal recovery. To characterize recovery, we performed a clustering analysis using Non-Human Primate Stroke Scale (NHPSS) scores and identified a good versus poor recovery group. By comparing the preservation of brain volumes in the two groups, we found that brain areas in integrity of brain areas in parietal, temporal and somatosensory cortex were associated with better recovery. In addition, a decoding approach performed across all subjects revealed that the preservation of specific brain regions in the parietal, somatosensory and medial frontal cortex predicted recovery. Together, these findings highlight the importance of the sensory and association regions in spontaneous behavioural recovery, supporting the notion that the  sensory retraining of impairments following stroke is critical to recovery and motor function.",

    "abstract": "Machine learning has become an important tool across biological disciplines, allowing researchers to draw conclusions from large datasets, and opening up new opportunities for interpreting complex and heterogeneous biological data. Alongside the rapid growth of machine learning, there have also been growing pains: some models that appear to perform well have later been revealed to rely on features of the data that are artifactual or biased; this feeds into the general criticism that machine learning models are designed to optimize model performance over the creation of new biological insights. A natural question thus arises: how do we develop machine learning models that are inherently interpretable or explainable? In this manuscript, we describe reliability scores, a new concept for scientific machine learning studies that assesses the ability of a classifier to produce a reliable classification for a given instance. We develop a specific implementation of a reliability score, based on our work in Sugden et al. 2018 in which we introduced SWIF(r), a generative classifier for detecting selection in genomic data. We call our implementation the SWIF(r) Reliability Score (SRS), and demonstrate the utility of the SRS when faced with common challenges in machine learning including: 1) an unknown class present in testing data that was not present in training data, 2) systemic mismatch between training and testing data, and 3) instances of testing data that are missing values for some attributes. We explore these applications of the SRS using a range of biological datasets, from agricultural data on seed morphology, to 22 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank, and population genetic simulations and 1000 Genomes Project data. With each of these examples, we demonstrate how interpretability tools for machine learning like the SRS can allow researchers to interrogate their data thoroughly, and to pair their domain-specific knowledge with powerful machine-learning frameworks. We hope that this tool, and the surrounding discussion, will aid researchers in the biological machine learning space as they seek to harness the power of machine learning without sacrificing rigor and biological understanding.",

    "abstract": "In many childhood-onset genetic epilepsies, seizures are accompanied by neurobehavioral impairments and motor disability. In the Stargazer mutant mouse, genetic disruptions of Cacng2 result in absence-like spike-wave seizures, cerebellar gait ataxia and vestibular dysfunction. Here, we combine videotracking and instrumented home-cage monitoring to resolve the neurobehavioral facets of the murine Stargazer syndrome. We find that despite their gait ataxia, stargazer mutants display horizontal hyperactivity and variable rates of repetitive circling behavior. While feeding rhythms, circadian or ultradian oscillations in activity are unchanged, mutants exhibit fragmented sleep bouts, atypical licking dynamics and lowered sucrose preference. Mutants also display an attenuated response to visual and auditory home-cage perturbations, together with profound reductions in voluntary wheel-running. Our results reveal that the seizures and ataxia of Stargazer mutants occur in the context of a more pervasive behavioral syndrome with elements of encephalopathy, repetitive behavior and anhedonia. These findings expand our understanding of the function of Cacng2/CACNG2, variants in which have been identified in patients with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.",

    "abstract": "Host-targeted therapeutics to control viral infection are gaining prominence given the vulnerability of viral replication at select host-interaction points and the limited possibility of developing drug resistant mutants. Nevertheless, the chemical and biological impact of many host-targeted therapeutics on both the cell and virus has not been elucidated and remains a key complication. Previously, it has been demonstrated that inhibition of fatty acid metabolism has significant antiviral potential. Here, we use a multidisciplinary approach to demonstrate how inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis creates a metabolically refractory environment that drives viral dependence on alternate metabolic pathways for survival. By profiling the global metabolic landscape following inhibition of fatty acid biosynthesis, we identified additional biochemical pathways that, when inhibited in combination with fatty acid biosynthesis, displayed increased antiviral potential. Our studies also demonstrated that there was a direct link between changes in cellular chemical composition and the ultrastructural membrane architecture induced by viral gene products. Utilizing inhibitors to change these metabolic environments significantly impacted early viral replication and disrupted the membrane architecture critical for the viral life cycle. Here, we have defined at a molecular level how shifting metabolic landscapes can be exploited to identify combinations of therapeutics that have a greater antiviral effect.\n\nAuthor SummaryDengue viruses are transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which are prevalent in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. These viruses cause over 350 million infections annually. There are no antivirals to combat infection and the only vaccine available is suboptimal. Since these viruses are obligate pathogens, they hijack lipid metabolic pathways in host cells to drive new lipid synthesis critically required for their replication. Mechanisms of how lipid synthesis impacts viral replication is unknown. These viruses also rearrange cellular membranes to form platforms for assembly of viral replication complexes. Here, for the first time, we show that virus-hijacking of de novo fatty acid biosynthesis pathways is required for the formation of membranous replication platforms and if inhibited disrupted synthesis of replicative form viral RNA. Importantly, these inhibitors drastically rearranged the metabolic landscape of the cell resulting in an activation of compensatory nucleotide synthesis pathways that allowed the virus to survive at a low level through the inhibition. However, if both pathways were inhibited in combination, infectious virus release was reduced to below detection limits. The study demonstrates how understanding the metabolic landscape altered by specific inhibitors can lead to the discovery of compensatory metabolic pathways and targets that in combination can enhance intervention efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Glyphosate, one of the most used herbicides worldwide, is known as an aquatic contaminant of concern, and can present adverse impacts in agroecosystems. In this study, we investigated the degradation of glyphosate in microbial electrochemical systems (MESs), and analysed the microbial composition of enriched anodic biofilms, and comparing them with microbial communities of non-MESs enriched cultures. MESs supported higher glyphosate degradation (68.41 {+/-} 1.21 % to 73.90 {+/-} 0.79 %) compared to non-MESs cultures (48.88 {+/-} 0.51 %). The Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV) analysis showed that MESs operated at +300 mV, produced a maximum current of 611.95 A, which was the highest among all the applied voltages. 16S amplicon sequencing revealed a significant difference in microbial community composition of MESs anodic biofilms and non-MESs enriched communities. The anodic biofilms were dominated by Rhodococcus (51.26 %), Pseudomonas (10.77 %), and Geobacter (8.67 %) while in non-MESs cultures, methanogens including Methanobrevibacter (51.18 %), and Methanobacterium (10.32 %), were the dominant genera.

    "abstract": "Inositol is an essential metabolite that serves as a precursor for structural and signaling molecules. Although perturbation of inositol homeostasis has been implicated in numerous human disorders, surprisingly little is known about how inositol levels are regulated in mammalian cells. A recent study in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) demonstrated that nuclear translocation of inositol hexakisphosphate kinase 1 (IP6K1) mediates repression of myo-3-P synthase (MIPS), the rate-limiting inositol biosynthetic enzyme. Binding of IP6K1 to phosphatidic acid (PA) is required for this repression. The current study was carried out to elucidate the role of PA in IP6K1 repression. The results indicate that increasing PA levels through pharmacological stimulation of phospholipase D (PLD) or direct supplementation of 18:1 PA induces nuclear translocation of IP6K1 and represses expression of MIPS protein. This effect was specific to PA synthesized in the plasma membrane, as ER-derived PA did not induce IP6K1 translocation. PLD-mediated PA synthesis can be stimulated by the master metabolic regulator 5 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Activation of AMPK by glucose deprivation or by treatment with the mood stabilizing drugs valproate (VPA) or lithium recapitulated IP6K1 nuclear translocation and decreased MIPS expression. This study demonstrates for the first time that modulation of PA levels through the AMPK-PLD pathway regulates IP6K1-mediated repression of MIPS.",

    "abstract": "The natural product jasplakinolide is a widely used tool compound to stabilize F-actin and influence actin dynamics. We have previously introduced photoswitchable jasplakinolides (optojasps) that are activated with violet light and deactivated with blue light. Based on insights from cryo-electron microscopy and structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, we now developed a new generation of functionally superior optojasps that are better suited for biological investigations. These compounds are procured through chemical total synthesis and feature rationally designed red-shifted azobenzene photoswitches. Our new optojasps can be activated with longer wavelengths in the visible range (e.g. 440-477 nm) and rapidly return to their inactive state through thermal relaxation. This has enabled the reversible control of F-actin dynamics, as shown through live-cell imaging and cell migration, as well as cell proliferation assays. Brief sub-cellular activation with blue-green light resulted in highly localized F-actin clusters that gradually dissolved in the dark. Our light-responsive tools can be useful in diverse fields to study actin dynamics with outstanding spatiotemporal precision.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=87 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/480923v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (36K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1883e3corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ae0c4borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a92f8forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@718d87_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "As neutrophils navigate complex environments to reach sites of infection, they may encounter obstacles that force them to split their front into multiple leading edges, raising the question of how the cell selects which front to maintain and which front(s) to abandon. Here we challenge chemotaxing HL60 neutrophil-like cells with symmetric bifurcating microfluidic channels, enabling us to probe the cell-intrinsic properties of their decision-making process. Using supervised statistical learning, we demonstrate that cells commit to one leading edge late in the decision- making process, rather than amplifying early pre-existing asymmetries. Furthermore, we use optogenetic tools to show that receptor inputs only bias the decision similarly late, once mechanical stretching begins to weaken each front. Finally, optogenetic attempts to reverse cell decisions reveal that, once an edge begins retracting, it commits to this fate, with the kinase ROCK limiting its sensitivity to inputs until the retraction is complete. Collectively our results suggest a \"selective listening\" model in which both actively protruding cell fronts and actively retracting cell rears have strong commitment to their current migratory program.",

Yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which DDX3X controls cortical development are largely unknown. Here, using a mouse model of Ddx3x loss-of-function we demonstrate that DDX3X directs translational and cell cycle control of neural progenitors, which underlies precise corticogenesis. First, we show brain development is highly sensitive to Ddx3x dosage; Complete Ddx3x loss from neural progenitors causes microcephaly in females, whereas hemizygous males and heterozygous females show reduced neurogenesis without marked microcephaly. In addition, Ddx3x loss is sexually dimorphic, as its paralog, Ddx3y, compensates for Ddx3x in the developing male neocortex. Using live imaging of progenitors, we show that DDX3X promotes neuronal generation by regulating both cell cycle duration and neurogenic divisions. Finally, we use ribosome profiling in vivo to discover the repertoire of translated transcripts in neural progenitors, including those which are DDX3X-dependent and essential for neurogenesis. Our study reveals invaluable new insights into the etiology of DDX3X syndrome, implicating dysregulated progenitor cell cycle dynamics and translation as pathogenic mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Characterising the genetic diversity of pathogens within the host promises to greatly improve surveillance and reconstruction of transmission chains. For bacteria, it also informs our understanding of inter-strain competition, and how this shapes the distribution of resistant and sensitive bacteria. Here we study the genetic diversity of Streptococcus pneumoniae within individual infants and their mothers by deep sequencing whole pneumococcal populations from longitudinal nasopharyngeal samples. We demonstrate deep sequencing has unsurpassed sensitivity for detecting multiple colonisation, doubling the rate at which highly invasive serotype 1 bacteria were detected in carriage compared to gold-standard methods. The greater resolution identified an elevated rate of transmission from mothers to their children in the first year of the childs life. Comprehensive treatment data demonstrated infants were at an elevated risk of both the acquisition, and persistent colonisation, of a multidrug resistant bacterium following antimicrobial treatment. Some alleles were enriched after antimicrobial treatment, suggesting they aided persistence, but generally purifying selection dominated within-host evolution. Rates of co-colonisation imply that in the absence of treatment, susceptible lineages outcompeted resistant lineages within the host. These results demonstrate the many benefits of deep sequencing for the genomic surveillance of bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Herbicide resistance represents one of the biggest threats to our natural environment and agricultural sector. Thus, new herbicides are urgently needed to tackle the rise in herbicideresistant weeds. Here, we employed a novel strategy to repurpose a  failed antibiotic into a new and target-specific herbicidal compound. Specifically, we identified an inhibitor of bacterial dihydrodipicolinate reductase (DHDPR), an enzyme involved in lysine biosynthesis in plants and bacteria, that exhibited no antibacterial activity but severely attenuated germination of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We confirmed that the inhibitor targets plant DHDPR orthologues in vitro, and exhibits no toxic effects against human cell lines. A series of analogues were then synthesised with improved efficacy in germination assays and against soil-grown A. thaliana plants. We also showed that our lead compound is the first lysine biosynthesis inhibitor with herbicidal activity against a weed species, providing proof-of-concept that DHDPR inhibition may represent a much-needed new herbicide mode of action. Furthermore, this study exemplifies the untapped potential of repurposing  failed antibiotic scaffolds to fast-track the development of herbicide candidates targeting the respective plant enzymes to combat the global rise in herbicide-resistant weeds.",

    "abstract": "ARID1A, a subunit of SWI/SNF, has been shown to play a major role in recruitment of the chromatin remodeler to enhancers for transcriptional regulation. Mutations inARID1A have been found in various cancers, many of which form solid tumors. Recent studies have revealed vulnerabilities in cells lacking ARID1A, specifically ARID1B, an ortholog and mutually exclusive subunit, in 2D cell culture. However, identification of vulnerabilities within SWI/SNF for loss of ARID1A in a multicellular tumor spheroid, that mimic in vivo condition within tumors, has not been explored. Here we show in the absence of ARID1A in a MTS model, ARID1B continues to be a vulnerability but we have identified PBRM1 as a new vulnerability within SWI/SNF. Levels of ARID1B and PBRM1 are elevated on loss of ARID1A. Further, reduction of ARID1B and PBRM1 protein levels, decreases cell survival and reduces induction of several hypoxia regulated genes in ARID1A deficient MTSs. Our studies have identified PBRM1 as a new vulnerability in ARID1a deficient cancers and which provides a new target for therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "The androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid receptor and master transcription factor that governs gene expression programs required for luminal development of prostate epithelium, formation of muscle tissue and maintenance of the male phenotype. AR misregulation is a hallmark of multiple malignancies, including prostate cancer, where AR hyperactivation and expansion of its transcriptome occur in part through AR gene amplification and interaction with oncoprotein cofactors. Despite its biological importance, how ARs individual domains and its protein cofactors cooperate to bind DNA have remained elusive. Using a combination of reconstitution biochemistry and single particle cryo-electron microscopy (EM), we have isolated three conformational states of AR bound to DNA. We observe that AR forms a non-obligate dimer, with the buried dimer interface utilized by related ancestral nuclear receptors repurposed to facilitate cooperative DNA binding. We identify surfaces bridging ARs domains responsible for allosteric communication, that are compromised in partial androgen insensitivity syndrome (PAIS), and are reinforced by ARs oncoprotein cofactor, ERG, and DNA binding site motifs. Finally, we present evidence that this plastic dimer interface for transcriptional activation may have been adopted by AR at the expense of DNA binding. Our work highlights how fine-tuning of ARs cooperative interactions translate to consequences in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone injuries present a major surgical challenge and cannot heal naturally due to their large size and complex topography. Approximately 26% of injured Iraq war veterans sustained CMF injuries in the form of blast wounds, and 0.1% of births involve CMF defects like cleft palate. We previously developed a class of mineralized collagen scaffolds designed to mimic native extracellular matrix (ECM) features of bone. These scaffolds induce in vitro human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) osteogenic differentiation and in vivo bone formation without the need for exogenous osteogenic supplements. Here, we seek to enhance cellular bioactivity and osteogenic activity via inclusion of placental-derived products in the scaffold architecture. The amnion and chorion membranes are distinct components of the placenta that individually have displayed anti-inflammatory, immunogenic, and osteogenic properties. They represent a potentially powerful compositional modification to the mineralized collagen scaffolds to improve bioactivity. Here we examine introduction of the placental-derived amnion and chorion membranes or soluble extracts derived from these membranes into the collagen scaffolds, comparing the potential for these modifications to improve hMSC osteogenic activity. We report structural analysis of the scaffolds via mechanical compression testing, imaging via scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and assessments of various metrics for osteogenesis including gene expression (Nanostring), protein elution (ELISA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP) for mineralization, and cell viability (AlamarBlue). Notably, a post fabrication step to incorporate soluble extracts from the amnion membrane induces the highest levels of metabolic activity and performs similarly to the conventional mineralized collagen scaffolds in regard to mineral deposition and elution of the osteoclast inhibitor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Together, these findings suggest that mineralized collagen scaffolds modified using elements derived from amnion and chorion membranes, particularly their soluble extracts, represent a promising environment conducive to craniomaxillofacial bone repair.",

Upon stimulation by two endogenous neuropeptides, neuromedin U and S (NMU and NMS) with similar binding affinities, NMUR1 and NMUR2 primarily display distinct peripheral tissue and central nervous system (CNS) functions, respectively, due to their distinct tissue distributions. These NMU receptors have triggered extensive attention as drug targets for obesity and immune inflammation. Specifically, selective agonists for NMUR1 in peripheral tissue show promising long-term anti-obesity effects with fewer CNS-related side effects. However, the mechanisms of peptide binding specificity and receptor activation remain elusive due to the lack of NMU receptor structures, which hamper drug design targeting NMU receptors. Here, we report four cryo-electron microscopy structures of Gq chimera-coupled NMUR1 and NMUR2 bound with NMU and NMS. These structures present the conserved overall peptide-binding mode and reveal the mechanism of peptide selectivity for specific NMURs, as well as the common activation mechanism of the NMUR subfamily.

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development. Under low iron conditions, Arabidopsis plants take up soil iron using the root iron transporter IRT1. In addition to iron, IRT1 also transports others divalent metals including cadmium that consequently accumulates into plant tissues and enters the food chain. IRT1 expression was shown to be regulated at the transcriptional and post-translational levels by its essential metal substrates to maximize iron uptake while limiting the accumulation of zinc, manganese or cobalt. Here, we characterized the regulation of IRT1 by cadmium and uncovered a cadmium-mediated downregulation of IRT1 protein by endocytosis. A short term exposure to cadmium indeed decreased the celle surface levels of IRT1 through endocytosis and degradation. This is mediated through the direct binding of cadmium to histidine residues within the regulatory loop of IRT1. Moreover, we demonstrated that cadmium-induced IRT1 degradation uses ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis driven by the IDF1 E3 ligase. Altogether, this work sheds light on the mechanisms of cadmium-mediated downregulation of IRT1 and offers a unique opportunity to boost plant cadmium uptake in phytoremediation/phytoextraction strategies.",

    "abstract": "Uterine Natural Killer cells (uNK) play an important role in promoting successful pregnancy by regulating trophoblast invasion and spiral artery remodelling in the first trimester. Recently, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) on first trimester decidua showed that uNKs can be divided into three subsets, which may have different roles in pregnancy. Here we present an integration of previously published scRNAseq datasets, together with novel flow cytometry data to interrogate the frequency, phenotype and function of uNK1-3 in seven stages of the reproductive cycle (menstrual, proliferative, secretory phases; first, second, third trimester; and postpartum). We found that uNK1 and -2 peak in the first trimester, but by the third trimester the majority of uNK are uNK3. All three subsets are most able to degranulate and produce cytokines during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle and express KIR2D molecules, which allow them to interact with HLA-C expressed by placental extravillous trophoblast cells, at the highest frequency during the first trimester. Taken together, our findings suggest that uNK are particularly active and able to interact with placental cells at the time of implantation, and that uNK1 and 2 may be particularly involved in these processes. Our findings are the first to establish how uNK frequency and function changes dynamically across the healthy reproductive cycle. This serves as a platform from which the relationship between uNK function and impaired implantation and placentation can be investigated. This will have important implications for the study of subfertility, recurrent miscarriage, pre-eclampsia and pre-term labour.",

Early-life disruptions to microbiome establishment can negatively impact host fitness and development. However, the consequences of such early-life disruptions are unknown in wild birds. To help fill this gap, after validating the disruptive influence of antibiotic and probiotic treatments on the gut microbiome in adult Great tits (Parus major) (efficacy experiment), we investigated the effect of continuous early-life gut microbiome disruptions on the establishment and development of gut communities in wild Great and Blue tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) nestlings (field experiment). Despite negative impacts of treatments on microbial alpha and beta diversities in the efficacy experiment, treatment did not affect the composition of nestling microbiomes in the field experiment. Independent of treatment, nestling gut microbiomes of both species grouped by brood, sharing high numbers of bacterial taxa with both the nest environment and their mother. The distance between nests increased inter-brood microbiome dissimilarity, but only in Great tits, indicating species-specific influence of environment on microbiomes. The strong maternal effect, driven by continuous recolonization from the nest environment and vertical transfer of microbes during feeding thus appear to provide resilience towards early-life disruptions in nestling gut microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes 200,000 cancers annually. Upon B-cell infection, EBV induces lipid metabolism to support B-cell proliferation. Yet, little is known about how latent EBV infection, or human B-cell stimulation more generally, alter sensitivity to ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of programmed cell death driven by iron-dependent lipid peroxidation and membrane damage. To gain insights, we analyzed lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and ferroptosis vulnerability in primary human CD19+ B-cells infected by EBV or stimulated by key B-cell receptors. Prior to the first mitosis, EBV-infected cells were exquisitely sensitive to blockade of glutathione biosynthesis, a phenomenon not observed with B-cell receptor stimulation. Subsequently, EBV-mediated Burkitt-like hyper-proliferation generated elevated levels of lipid ROS, which necessitated SLC7A11-mediated cystine import and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) activity to prevent ferroptosis. By comparison, B-cells were sensitized to ferroptosis induction by combinatorial CD40-ligand and interleukin-4 stimulation or anti-B-cell receptor and Toll-like receptor 9 stimulation upon GPX4 inhibition, but not with SLC7A11 blockade. EBV transforming B-cells became progressively resistant to ferroptosis induction upon switching to the latency III program and lymphoblastoid physiology. Similarly, latency I Burkitt cells were particularly vulnerable to blockade of SLC7A11 or GPX4 or cystine withdrawal, while latency III Burkitt and lymphoblastoid cells were comparatively resistant. The selenocysteine biosynthesis kinase PSTK was newly implicated as a cellular target for ferroptosis induction including in Burkitt cells, likely due to roles in GPX4 biosynthesis. These results highlight ferroptosis as an intriguing therapeutic target for the prevention or treatment of particular EBV-driven B-cell malignancies.\n\nSignificanceEBV contributes to B-cell Burkitt and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). EBV transforming programs activate lipid metabolism to convert B-cells into immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), a PTLD model. We found that stages of EBV transformation generate lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) byproducts to varying degrees, and that a Burkitt-like phase of B-cell outgrowth is dependent on lipid ROS detoxification by glutathione peroxidase 4 and its cofactor glutathione. Perturbation of this redox defense in early stages of B-cell transformation or in Burkitt cells triggered ferroptosis, a programmed cell death pathway. LCLs were less dependent on this defense, a distinction tied to EBV latency programs. This highlights ferroptosis induction as a novel therapeutic approach for prevention or treatment of EBV+ lymphomas.",

    "abstract": "Decades of research in Saccharomyces cerevisiae underlie the current dogma of mitochondrial retrograde (RTG) signaling: Rtg2-dependent translocation of the heterodimer Rtg1/Rtg3 from the cytoplasm to the nucleus induces the transcription of RTG-target genes under glutamate starvation or loss of respiration. We previously found that RTG mutants show severe growth inhibition from arginine deprivation and are highly sensitive to canavanine when grown on glucose. Here, we show that on solid media, RTG mutants are also sensitive to thialysine, a toxic lysine analog, although lysine deprivation causes a milder growth defect. Growth on an alternative carbon source restores RTG mutants ability to grow without arginine or lysine and improves their tolerance of toxic analogs; deletion of MIG1 affords a similar rescue on glucose and improves canavanine tolerance, except for in rtg2{Delta}. It is well known that the target of rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway inhibits the RTG pathway. Batch growth experiments with or without TOR inhibition reveal phenotypic and regulatory differences between RTG mutants. rtg1{Delta} can sustain simultaneous canavanine exposure and TOR inhibition via rapamycin, but rtg2{Delta} and rtg3{Delta} cannot. Surprisingly, our data show that under fermentative lifestyle and arginine deprivation, both RTG signaling and TOR activity are required. This expands the universe of TOR and RTG signaling, suggesting bilateral communication rather than unidirectional RTG regulation by TOR. To the best of our knowledge, this work shows for the first time that Rtg3 activity can be separate from its role as a heterodimer with Rtg1. This work also strongly suggests a specific role for Rtg2 in canavanine tolerance.",

    "abstract": "Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by immune dysfunction, mucus hypersecretion, and persistent infection of the paranasal sinuses. While Staphylococcus aureus is a primary CRS pathogen, recent sequence-based surveys have found increased relative abundances of anaerobic bacteria, suggesting that S. aureus may experience altered metabolic landscapes in CRS relative to healthy airways. To test this possibility, we characterized the growth kinetics and transcriptome of S. aureus in supernatants of the abundant CRS anaerobe Fusobacterium nucleatum. While growth was initially delayed, S. aureus ultimately grew to similar levels as in the control medium. The transcriptome was significantly affected by F. nucleatum metabolites, with the agr quorum sensing system notably repressed. Conversely, expression of fadX, encoding a putative propionate coA-transferase, was significantly increased, leading to our hypothesis that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by F. nucleatum could mediate S. aureus growth behavior and gene expression. Supplementation with propionate and butyrate, but not acetate, recapitulated delayed growth phenotypes observed in F. nucleatum supernatants. A fadX mutant was found to be more sensitive than wild type to propionate, suggesting a role for FadX in the S. aureus SCFA stress response. Interestingly, spontaneous resistance to butyrate, but not propionate, was frequently observed. Whole genome sequencing and targeted mutagenesis identified codY mutants as resistant to butyrate inhibition. Together, these data show that S. aureus physiology is dependent on its co-colonizing microbiota and metabolites they exchange, and indicate that propionate and butyrate may act on different targets in S. aureus to suppress its growth.\n\nImportanceS. aureus is an important CRS pathogen, yet is found in the upper airways of 30-50% of people without complications. The presence of strict and facultative anaerobic bacteria in CRS sinuses has recently spurred research into bacterial interactions and how they influence S. aureus physiology and pathogenesis. We show here that propionate and butyrate produced by one such CRS anaerobe, F. nucleatum, alter the growth and gene expression of S. aureus. We show that fadX is important for S. aureus to resist propionate stress, and that the CodY regulon mediates growth in inhibitory concentrations of butyrate. This work highlights the possible complexity of S. aureus-anaerobe interactions, and implicates membrane stress as a possible mechanism influencing S. aureus behavior in CRS sinuses.",

In addition, it was demonstrated that acpA has at least two promotors, one of them shared with atxA. We used a genetic approach to study capsule and toxin production under different conditions. Unlike previous works utilizing NBY-HCO3- medium under CO2 enriched conditions, we used a sDMEM-based medium. Thus, toxin and capsule production can be induced in ambient or CO2 enriched atmosphere. Using this system, we could differentiate between induction by 10% NRS, 10% CO2 or 0.75% HCO3-. In response to high CO2, capsule production is induced by acpA in an atxA-independent manner, with little to no toxin (protective antigen PA) production. atxA is activated in response to serum independently of CO2, inducing toxin and capsule production in an acpA or acpB dependent manner. HCO3- was also found to activate atxA, but in non-physiological concentrations. Our findings may help explain the first stages of inhalational infection, in which spores germinating in dendritic cells require protection (by encapsulation) without affecting cell migration to the draining lymph-node by toxin secretion.",

    "abstract": "RNA polymerase I (Pol I) products play pivotal roles in ribosomal assembly, protein synthesis and cell growth. Dysregulation of Pol I product synthesis closely correlates with tumourigenesis. However, the factors and pathways governing Pol I-dependent transcription remain to be identified. Here, we report that TFIIB-related factor 1 (BRF1), a subunit of TFIIIB required for Pol III-mediated transcription, is a nucleolar protein and modulates the rRNA synthesis directed by Pol I. We show that BRF1 can be co-localized with nucleolar protein markers in several human cell types. BRF1 expression positively correlates with Pol I product levels and tumour cell growth in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, BRF1 binds to the Pol I transcription machinery factors and is recruited to the rDNA promoter with them. Alteration of BRF1 expression affected the recruitment of Pol I transcription machinery at the rDNA promoter, the rDNA promoter activity and expression of TBP and TAF1A, indicating that BRF1 modulates Pol I-direct transcription by controlling the expression of selective factor 1 subunits. Collectively, we demonstrate that BRF1 acts as a positive factor to regulate Pol I-directed transcription, suggesting that BRF1 can concurrently modulate Pol I and Pol III transcription and acts as a key coordinator between them.",

    "abstract": "Contact sites between the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) regulate the exchange of lipids, Ca2+, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) across the two organelles. Mitofusin 2 (Mfn2) has been identified as one of the major components tethering these two organelles together. Several post-translational modifications (PTMs) of Mfn2 have been shown to modulate canonical (i.e., mitochondrial fusion) and non-canonical Mfn2 functions, such as mitophagy and activation of ER stress signaling. However, there is little information about whether any PTMs can regulate mitochondrial and ER tethering. Basal tyrosine phosphorylation of Mfn2 was detected by mass spectroscopy, but it is unknown whether Mfn2 is a substrate of mitochondria-localized tyrosine kinases. Here, we show that mitochondria-localized c-Src can phosphorylate the C-terminal tail of Mfn2, which decreases the distance between the mitochondria and ER and facilitates Ca2+ transfer from the ER to mitochondria, followed by changes in ROS generation and mitochondrial bioenergetics. Our findings suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Mfn2 may uniquely work to fine-tune ER-mitochondrial Ca2+ transport under physiological and pathological conditions.",

    "abstract": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), whose main risk factor is cigarette smoking (CS), is one of the most common diseases globally. Many COPD patients also develop pulmonary hypertension (PH), a severe complication that leads to premature death. Evidence suggests reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement in COPD and PH, especially regarding pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC) dysfunction. However, the effects of CS on the pulmonary vasculature are not completely understood. Herein we provide evidence on the effects of CS extract (CSE) exposure on PASMC regarding ROS production, antioxidant response and its consequences on vascular tone dysregulation. Our results indicate that CSE exposure promotes mitochondrial fission, mitochondrial membrane depolarization and increased mitochondrial superoxide levels. However, the increase in superoxide did not parallel a counterbalancing antioxidant response in human pulmonary artery (PA) cells. Interestingly, the mitochondrial superoxide chelator mitoTEMPO reduced mitochondrial fission and membrane potential depolarization caused by CSE. As we have previously shown, CSE reduces PA vasoconstriction and vasodilation. In this respect, mitoTEMPO prevented the impaired nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation, while vasoconstriction remained reduced. Finally, we observed a CSE-driven downregulation of the Cyb5R3 enzyme, which prevents soluble guanylyl cyclase oxidation in PASMC. This might explain the CSE-mediated decrease in PA vasodilation. These results provide evidence that there might be a connection between mitochondrial ROS and altered vasodilation responses in PH secondary to COPD, and strongly support the potential of antioxidant strategies specifically targeting mitochondria as a new therapy for these diseases.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

P. aeruginosa strains that express ExoU are implicated in the worst clinical outcomes. ExoU is phospholipase that is secreted by P. aeruginosa directly into the cytoplasm of target host cells, where its catalytic activity, directed towards plasma membranes, causes rapid cell lysis. Inhibition of ExoU may be a novel strategy to combat acutely cytotoxic ExoU expressing P. aeruginosa infections. Using an in vitro phospholipase assay, we performed a high throughput screen to identify compounds that might be repurposed as therapeutic ExoU inhibitors. We discovered a panel of compounds that appeared to inhibit ExoU through distinct mechanisms. Compound C prevented ExoU membrane localisation in HEK293T cells and caused colocalization with lysosomes, whereas compound D prevented PIP2 dependent oligomerisation of ExoU in vitro suggestive of synergistic action. Indeed, the concentrations required by compounds C and D to inhibit in vitro ExoU catalytic activity, when used in combination, was in the nanomolar region. In corneal scratch and infection assays, these compounds reduced ExoU mediated cytotoxicity, as assessed by fluorescence microscopy and lactate dehydrogenase release assays.",

Combining the realistic cornea structure and measured RI gradients with full-wave optical modelling and ray-tracing approaches, we show that the light collection mechanism depends on both refraction-based graded index (GRIN) optics and total internal reflection.

    "abstract": "Mutations that affect protein binding to a cognate partner primarily occur either at buried residues or at exposed residues directly involved in partner binding. Distinguishing between these two categories based solely on mutational phenotypes is challenging. The bacterial toxin CcdB kills cells by binding to DNA Gyrase. Cell death is prevented by binding to its cognate antitoxin CcdA, at an extended interface that partially overlaps with the GyrA binding site. Using the CcdAB toxin-antitoxin (TA) system as a model, a comprehensive site-saturation mutagenesis library of CcdB was generated in its native operonic context. The mutational sensitivity of each mutant was estimated by evaluating the relative abundance of each mutant in two strains, one resistant and the other sensitive to the toxic activity of the CcdB toxin, through deep sequencing. The ability to bind CcdA was inferred through a RelE reporter gene assay, since the CcdAB complex binds to its own promoter, repressing transcription. By analysing mutant phenotypes in the CcdB sensitive, CcdB resistant and RelE reporter strains, it was possible to assign residues to buried, CcdA interacting or GyrA interacting sites. A few mutants were individually constructed, expressed, and biophysically characterised to validate molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed phenotypes. Residues inferred to be important for antitoxin binding, are also likely to be important for rejuvenating CcdB from the CcdB-Gyrase complex. Therefore, even in the absence of structural information, when coupled to appropriate genetic screens, such high-throughput strategies can be deployed for predicting structural and functional determinants of proteins.\n\nBroader Impact StatementPartial loss-of-function mutations predominantly occur either at buried-site or exposed, active-site residues. We report a facile method to identify multiple binding sites for different interacting partners for a protein, and distinguish them from buried site and exposed non active-site residues, solely from mutational data.",

    "abstract": "Knowing intracellular metabolite concentrations is important for fundamental metabolism research as well as for biotechnology. The first steps in a quantitative metabolomics workflow, i.e., sampling, quenching, and extraction, are key to obtaining unbiased quantitative data. A qualified quenching and extraction method not only needs to rapidly terminate the in vivo biochemical reaction activities to preserve the endogenous metabolite levels but also has to fully extract all metabolites from cells. Recently, two different filtration-based sampling, quenching, and extraction methods have been proposed and used for quantitative yeast metabolomics. One method integrates the quenching and extraction into one step using a methanol-acetonitrile-water solution after a filtration step, while the other --more conventional-- method quenches with cold methanol and extracts with boiling ethanol. In this study, we tested whether these two methods are equally well suited for quantitative metabolome analyses with yeast. Using isotope dilution mass spectrometry (IDMS) with GC-MS and LC-MS as analytical methods, in combination with precise quantification of cell volumes, we determined absolute concentrations of 63 intracellular metabolites covering amino acids, organic acids, phosphorylated sugars, and nucleotides in two S. cerevisiae strains with different physiology. By analyzing the data from samples generated with the two methods, we found that while both methods yielded essentially identical concentrations for amino and organic acids, the cold-solvent extraction yielded significantly lower concentrations for particularly phosphorylated sugars and nucleotides, presumably because of lower quenching or extraction efficiency of this method. Our results show that methanol-quenching combined with boiling-ethanol-extraction is the more accurate approach when aiming to quantify a broad range of different metabolites from yeast cells. The significant discrepancy observed between both common metabolite extraction methods demonstrates the importance of method optimization for quantitative studies in particular when working with microbes with rigid cell walls such as those found in yeast.",

    "abstract": "Avian or human influenza A viruses bind preferentially to avian- or human-type sialic acid receptors, respectively, indicating that receptor tropism is an important factor for determining the viral host range. However, there are currently no reliable methods for analyzing receptor tropism biologically under physiological conditions. Here, we established a novel system using MDCK cells with avian- or human-type sialic acid receptors and with both sialic acid receptors knocked out (KO). When we examined the replication of human and avian influenza viruses in these KO cells, we observed unique viral receptor tropism that could not be detected using a conventional solid-phase sialylglycan binding assay, which directly assesses physical binding between the virus and sialic acids. Furthermore, we serially passaged an engineered avian-derived H4N5 influenza virus, whose PB2 gene was deleted, in avian-type receptor-KO cells stably expressing PB2 to select a mutant with enhanced replication in KO cells; however, its binding to human-type sialylglycan was undetectable using the solid-phase binding assay. These data indicate that a panel of sialic acid receptor-KO cells could be a useful tool for determining the biological receptor tropism of influenza A viruses. Moreover, the PB2-KO virus experimental system could help to safely and efficiently identify the mutations required for avian influenza viruses to adapt to human cells that could trigger a new influenza pandemic.\n\nAuthor summaryInfluenza A virus initiates infection via hemagglutinin by binding to avian- or human-type receptors. The acquisition of mutations that allow avian virus hemagglutinins (HAs) to recognize human-type receptors is mandatory for the transmission of avian influenza viruses to humans, which could lead to a pandemic. Therefore, it is important to detect such mutation(s) in animal influenza viruses for pandemic surveillance and risk assessment. In this study, we established a novel system using a set of genetically engineered MDCK cells with knocked out sialic acid receptors to biologically evaluate the receptor tropism for influenza A viruses. Using this system, we observed unique receptor tropism in several virus strains that was undetectable using conventional solid-phase binding assays that measure physical binding between the virus and artificially synthesized sialylglycans. This study makes a significant contribution to the literature because our findings suggest the pitfall of conventional receptor binding assay and the existence of a sialic acid-independent pathway for viral infection. In addition, our system could be safely used to identify mutations that could acquire human-type receptor tropism. Thus, this system could contribute not only toward basic analyses, such as elucidating the mechanism of influenza virus host range determination, but also the surveillance of viruses of animal origin that could be capable of infecting via human-type receptors, triggering a new influenza pandemic.",

Here, we present a systematic analysis of PNAs targeting eleven essential genes with varying expression levels in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC). We demonstrate that UPEC is susceptible to killing by peptide-conjugated PNAs, especially when targeting the widely-used essential gene acpP. Our evaluation yields three additional promising target mRNAs for effective growth inhibition, i.e., dnaB, ftsZ, and rpsH. The analysis also shows that transcript abundance does not predict target vulnerability and that PNA-mediated growth inhibition is not universally associated with target mRNA depletion. Global transcriptomic analyses further reveal PNA sequence-dependent but also -independent responses, including the induction of envelope stress response pathways. Importantly, we show that the growth inhibitory capacity of 9mer PNAs is generally as effective as their 10mer counterparts. Overall, our systematic comparison of a range of PNAs targeting mRNAs of different essential genes in UPEC suggests important features for PNA design, reveals a general bacterial response to PNA conjugates and establishes the feasibility of using PNA antibacterials to combat UPEC.",

    "abstract": "Pervasive transcription of eukaryotic genomes generates non-coding transcripts with regulatory potential. We examined the effects of non-coding antisense transcription on the regulation of expression of the yeast PHO5 gene, a paradigmatic case for gene regulation through promoter chromatin remodeling. A negative role for antisense transcription at the PHO5 gene locus was demonstrated by leveraging the level of overlapping antisense transcription through specific mutant backgrounds, expression from a strong promoter in cis, and use of the CRISPRi system. Furthermore, we showed that enhanced elongation of PHO5 antisense leads to a more repressive chromatin conformation at the PHO5 gene promoter, which is more slowly remodeled upon gene induction. The negative effect of antisense transcription on PHO5 gene transcription is mitigated upon inactivation of the histone deacetylase Rpd3, showing that PHO5 antisense RNA acts via histone deacetylation. This regulatory pathway leads to Rpd3-dependent decreased recruitment of the RSC chromatin remodeling complex to the PHO5 gene promoter upon induction of antisense transcription. Overall, the data in this work reveal an additional level in the complex regulatory mechanism of PHO5 gene expression by showing antisense transcription-mediated repression at the level of promoter chromatin structure remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Testosterone plays a critical role in mediating fitness-related traits in many species. Although it is highly responsive to environmental and social conditions, evidence from several species show a heritable component to its individual variation. Despite the known effects that in utero testosterone exposure have on adult fitness, the heritable component of individual testosterone variation in fetuses is mostly unexplored. Furthermore, testosterone has sex-differential effects on fetal development, i.e., a specific level may be beneficial for male fetuses but detrimental for females. The above mentioned may lead to a different genetic structure underlying the heritability of testosterone between the sexes. Here, we used a wild animal model, the feral nutria, quantified testosterone using hair-testing and estimated its heritability between parent and offspring from the same and opposite sex. We found that in utero accumulated hair testosterone levels were heritable between parents and offspring of the same sex. However, there was a low additive genetic covariance between the sexes, and a relatively low cross-sex genetic correlation, suggesting a potential for sex-dependent trait evolution, expressed early on, in utero.",

    "abstract": "During protein synthesis, the growing polypeptide chain threads through the nascent peptide exit tunnel that spans the body of the large ribosomal subunit while simultaneously acting as a modulator of ribosomal activity by itself or by sensing various small molecules, such as metabolites or antibiotics appearing in the tunnel. While arrested ribosome nascent chain complexes (RNCCs) have been extensively studied structurally, little attention has been given to the RNCCs that represent the functionally active state of the ribosome. This is in part due to the lack of a simple and reliable procedure for the large-scale preparation of peptidyl-tRNAs. Here we report a new chemoenzymatic approach based on native chemical ligation reaction for the facile synthesis of stably linked peptidyl-tRNAs that were used to determine several structures of RNCCs in the functional pre-attack state of the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) at the highest resolution available to date. These structures reveal a previously unknown role of the ribosome in stabilization of the growing polypeptide within the PTC and suggest an extended entropic trap model that mechanistically rationalizes how ribosome acts with comparable efficiencies upon a multitude of possible growing peptides having various sequences. Our structures also provide new insights into the mechanism of PTC functioning and explain what makes ribosome a versatile catalyst.",

    "abstract": "Arthropod predators are important for ecosystem functioning by providing top-down regulation of insect herbivores. As predator communities and activity are influenced by biotic and abiotic factors on different spatial scales, the strength of top-down regulation ( arthropod predation) is also likely to vary. Understanding the combined effects of potential drivers on arthropod predation is urgently needed with regard to anthropogenic climate and land-use change. In a large-scale study, we recorded arthropod predation rates using artificial caterpillars on 113 plots of open herbaceous vegetation embedded in contrasting habitat types (forest, grassland, arable field, settlement) along climate and land-use gradients in Bavaria, Germany. As potential drivers we included habitat characteristics (habitat type, plant species richness, local mean temperature and mean relative humidity during artificial caterpillar exposure), landscape diversity (0.5-3.0-km, six scales), climate (multi-annual mean temperature,  MAT) and interactive effects of habitat type with other drivers. We observed no substantial differences in arthropod predation rates between the studied habitat types, related to plant species richness and across the Bavarian-wide climatic gradient, but predation was limited when local mean temperatures were low and tended to decrease towards higher relative humidity. Arthropod predation rates increased towards more diverse landscapes at a 2-km scale. Interactive effects of habitat type with local weather conditions, plant species richness, landscape diversity and MAT were not observed. We conclude that landscape diversity favours high arthropod predation rates in open herbaceous vegetation independent of the dominant habitat in the vicinity. This finding may be harnessed to improve top-down control of herbivores, e.g. agricultural pests, but further research is needed for more specific recommendations on landscape management. The absence of MAT effects suggests that high predation rates may occur independent of moderate increases of MAT in the near future.",

    "abstract": "Coix lacryma-jobi L. is one of the most important economical and medicine corn. In this study, a high genetic linkage map has been constructed for Coix lacryma-jobi L. from a cross F2 community of \"Qianyi NO.2\" x \"Wenyi NO.2\" and their parents through high-throughput sequencing and specfic-locus amplified fragment (SLAF) library construction. After pre-processing, 325.49 Gb of raw data containing 1,628 M reads were obtained. A total of 22,944 high-quality SLAFs were detected, among which 3,952 SLAFs and 3,646 of the polymorphic markers could meet the requirements for construction of a genetic linkage map. The integrated map contains 3,605 high quality SLAFs, which are grouped to 10 genetic linkage groups. The total length of the linkage map is 1,620.39 cM with an average distance of 0.45 cM and 360.5 markers in average of per linkage group. This work will provide an important molecular biology basis for investigating their characteristics, gene cloning, molecular marker-assisted breeding, functional genomics and so on for Jobs tears.",

    "abstract": "Autosomal dominant diseases can be treated by allele-specific disruption of mutant alleles. If the missense mutation generates a novel protospacer-adjacent motif (PAM), CRISPR-Cas9 can distinguish mutant alleles from wild-type alleles by a PAM-specific approach. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a CRISPR toolbox capable of recognizing multiple PAMs. Here, by using a GFP-activation assay, we tested the activities of 29 type II-C orthologs closely related to Nme1Cas9, 25 of which are active in human cells. These orthologs recognize diverse PAMs with variable length and nucleotide preference, including purine-rich, pyrimidine-rich, and mixed purine and pyrimidine PAMs. We characterized in depth the activity and specificity of Nsp2Cas9. We also generated a chimeric Cas9 nuclease that recognizes a simple N4C PAM, representing the most relaxed PAM preference for compact Cas9s to date. These Cas9 nucleases significantly enhance our ability to perform allele-specific genome editing.",

    "abstract": "Reliably measuring small mass changes at the single-cell level is challenging. In this manuscript, we report the use of microfluidic cantilevers in liquid with sub-nanogram scale weight sensing capability for the measurement of cellular mass changes of living single cells. With this instrumentation, we were able to perform fast mass measurements within 3 minutes. We show results of mass measurements of polystyrene and metal beads of various sizes (smallest weight measured at 280 {+/-} 95 pg) and live single-cell mass measurements in a physiologically relevant environment. We also performed finite element analysis to simulate and optimize the structural design and materials of cantilevers. Our simulation results indicate that using polymer materials, such as SU8 and polyimide, could improve the minimal detectable mass by 3-fold compared to conventional silicon cantilevers. The simulations also suggest that smaller dimensions of length, width, and thickness would improve the mass detection capability of microfluidic cantilevers.",
