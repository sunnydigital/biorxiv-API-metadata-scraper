    "abstract": "Even though most axonal cargos are synthesized in the soma, the concentration of many of these cargos is larger at the presynaptic terminal than in the soma. This requires transport of these cargos from the soma to the presynaptic terminal or other active sites in the axon. Axons utilize both bidirectional (for example, slow axonal transport) and unidirectional (for example, fast anterograde axonal transport) modes of cargo transport. Bidirectional transport seems to be less efficient because it requires more time and takes more energy to deliver cargos. In this paper, we studied a family of models which differ by the modes of axonal cargo transport (such as anterograde and retrograde motor-driven transport and passive diffusion) as well as by the presence or absence of pausing states. The models are studied to investigate their ability to describe axonal transport against the cargo concentration gradient. We argue that bidirectional axonal transport is described by a higher-order mathematical model, which allows imposing cargo concentration not only at the axon hillock but also at the axon terminal. The unidirectional transport model allows only for the imposition of cargo concentration at the axon hillock. Due to the great lengths of the axons, anterograde transport mostly relies on molecular motors, such as kinesins, to deliver cargos synthesized in the soma to the terminal and other active sites in the axon. Retrograde transport can be also motor-driven, in which case cargos are transported by dynein motors. If cargo concentration at the axon tip is higher than at the axon hillock, retrograde transport can also occur by cargo diffusion. However, because many axonal cargos are large or they assemble in multiprotein complexes for axonal transport, the diffusivity of such cargos is very small. We investigated the case of a small cargo diffusivity using a perturbation technique and found that for this case the effect of diffusion is limited to a very thin diffusion boundary layer near the axon tip. If cargo diffusivity is decreased in the model, we show that without motor-driven retrograde transport the model is unable to describe a high cargo concentration at the axon tip. To the best of our knowledge, our paper presents the first explanation for the utilization of seemingly inefficient bidirectional transport in neurons.",

    "abstract": "Individuals differ in their responsiveness to hypnotic suggestions. However, defining and measuring hypnotizability is contentious because standardized scales, such as the Harvard group scale (HGSHS:A), measure a mixture of general suggestibility and its alteration due to hypnotic induction (hypnotizability). Exploratory factor analyses (FA) of standardized scales indicated their multidimensionality; however, the number and nature of latent factors are debated. We applied Confirmatory FA to the HGSHS:A scores of 477 volunteers and tested several theory-driven models. Scores were best explained by a bifactor model consisting of a G-factor and three correlated minor factors. The presented bifactor model shows that two sources of variability affect HGSHS:A simultaneously. Structural equation modeling revealed that the challenge-ideomotor factor predicts the other two minor factors, implying these suggestions might require more fundamental processes than other types. These results demonstrate the multifaceted and bifactorial structure of hypnotic suggestibility and underscore the desideratum for developing more differentiated scales.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMenthol, through its cooling and pleasant sensory effects, facilitates smoking and tobacco product initiation, resulting in the high popularity of mint/menthol-flavored E-cigarettes. More recently, E-cigarette vendors started marketing synthetic cooling agents as additives that impart a cooling effect but lack a characteristic minty odor. Knowledge about content of synthetic coolants in US-marketed E-cigarette products and associated health risks is limited.\n\nMethodsE-liquid vendor sites were searched with the terms \"koolada\", \"kool/cool\", \"ice\", or WS-3/WS-23, denoting individual cooling agents, and relevant refill E-liquids were purchased. \"Ice\" flavor varieties of Puffbar, the most popular disposable E-cigarette brand, were compared with non-\"Ice\" varieties. E-liquids were characterized, and synthetic coolants quantified using GC/MS. Margin of exposure (MOE), a risk assessment parameter, was calculated to assess the risk associated with synthetic coolant exposure from E-cigarette use.\n\nResultsWS-3 was detected in 24/25 refill E-liquids analyzed. All Puffbar flavor varieties contained either WS-23 (13/14) or WS-3 (5/14), in both \"Ice\"- and non-\"Ice\" flavors. Modeling consumption of WS-3 from vaped E-liquids, resulted in MOEs below the safe margin of 100 for most daily use scenarios. MOEs for WS-23 were <100 for 10/13 Puffbar flavors in all use scenarios. Puffbar power specifications are identical to Juul devices.\n\nConclusionsSynthetic cooling agents (WS-3/WS-23) were present in US-marketed E-cigarettes, at levels that may result in consumer exposures exceeding safety thresholds set by regulatory agencies. Synthetic coolants are not only found in mint-or menthol-flavored products, but also in fruit- and candy-flavored products, including popular disposable E-cigarette products such as Puffbar.\n\nImplicationsSynthetic cooling agents are widely used in \"kool/cool\"- and \"ice\"-flavored E-liquids and in E-liquids without these labels, both as a potential replacement for menthol or to add cooling  notes to non-menthol flavors. These agents may be used to bypass current and future regulatory limits on menthol content in tobacco products, and not just E-cigarettes. Since synthetic cooling agents are odorless, they may not fall under the category of \"characterizing flavor\", potentially circumventing regulatory measures based on this concept. Regulators need to consider the additional health risks associated with exposure to synthetic cooling agents.",

Using this method, we quantitatively compared the proteomes and metabolomes of guard cells and mesophyll cells and revealed that the enrichment of signal transduction-related proteins enables guard cells to respond rapidly to various environmental stimuli.

However, most PROTACs generated lack cell-type selectivity and have poorly soluble in water. To address this drawback, we developed a novel PROTAC ZL216 using aptamer AS1411 as a targeting ligand of nucleolin to conjugate with a small molecule ligand of E3 ligase VHL, which shows high aqueous solubility and serum stability. Based on the differential expression of nucleolin on the cell surface, ZL216 could bind to and internalize into breast cancer cells, but not normal breast cells. Furthermore, we revealed that ZL216 promoted the formation of a nucleolin-ZL216-VHL ternary complex in breast cancer cells and potently induced nucleolin degradation in vitro and in vivo. As a result, ZL216 inhibited the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells. These studies demonstrate that in addition to peptides and small molecule compounds, nuclei acid aptamers can also be used to generate PROTACs, which broadens the toolbox constructing PROTACs and provides a promising strategy for development of tumor-selective PROTACs.",

    "abstract": "Early predator detection is a key component of the predator-prey arms race, and has driven the evolution of multiple animal hearing systems. Katydids (Insecta) have sophisticated ears, each consisting of paired tympana on each foreleg that receive sound directly externally, and internally via a narrowing ear canal through the acoustic spiracle. These ears are pressure-time difference receivers capable of sensitive and accurate directional hearing across a wide frequency range, despite the small size of katydids. Many katydid species have cuticular pinnae which form cavities around the outer tympanal surfaces, but their function is unknown. We investigated pinnal function in the katydid Copiphora gorgonensis by combining experimental biophysics and numerical modelling using 3D ear geometries. Results show that the pinnae in C. gorgonensis do not assist in directional hearing for specific call frequencies, but instead pinnae act as ultrasound detector devices. Pinnae induced large sound pressure gains that enhanced sound detection at high ultrasonic frequencies (> 60 kHz), matching the echolocation range of co-occurring insectivorous bats. Comparing pinnal mechanics of sympatric katydid species supports these findings, and suggests that pinnae evolved in katydids primarily for enhanced predator detection. Audiograms (both behavioural and neural) and tympanal cavity resonances obtained from living specimens corroborate our findings.",

    "abstract": "Ischemic stroke causes brain endothelial cell (BEC) death and damages tight junction integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We harnessed the innate mitochondrial load of endothelial cell-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and utilized mixtures of EV/exogenous heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) as a one-two punch strategy to increase BEC survival (via EV mitochondria) and preserve their tight junction integrity (via HSP27 effects). We demonstrated that the medium-to-large (m/lEV) but not small EVs (sEV) transferred their mitochondrial load, which subsequently colocalized with the mitochondrial network of the recipient primary human BECs. BECs treated with m/lEVs increased relative ATP levels and displayed superior mitochondrial function. Importantly, m/lEVs isolated from oligomycin (mitochondrial complex V inhibitor) or rotenone (mitochondrial complex I inhibitor)-exposed BECs (RTN-m/lEVs or OGM-m/lEVs) did not increase BECs ATP levels compared to naive m/lEVs. In contrast, RTN-sEV and OGM-sEV functionality in increasing cellular ATP levels was minimally impacted in comparison to naive sEVs. Intravenously administered m/lEVs showed a reduction in brain infarct sizes compared to vehicle-injected mice in a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model of ischemic stroke. We formulated binary mixtures of human recombinant HSP27 protein with EVs: EV/HSP27 and ternary mixtures of HSP27 and EV with cationic polymer poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly (diethyltriamine): (PEG-DET/HSP27)/EV. (PEG-DET/HSP27)/EV and EV/HSP27 mixtures decreased the paracellular permeability of small and large molecular mass fluorescent tracers in oxygen glucose-deprived primary human BECs. This one-two-punch approach to increase BEC metabolic function and tight junction integrity is a promising strategy for BBB protection and prevention of long-term neurological dysfunction post-ischemic stroke.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=104 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/466491v5_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc5493org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134ad7forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a8929org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15315bc_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIMedium-to-large extracellular vesicles (m/lEVs), not small EVs contain mitochondria\nC_LIO_LIm/lEVs increased ATP and mitochondrial function in brain endothelial cells (BECs)\nC_LIO_LIm/lEVs from oligomycin-exposed BECs did not increase recipient BEC ATP levels\nC_LIO_LIIntravenously injected m/lEVs reduced brain infarct sizes in a mouse stroke model\nC_LIO_LIEV/HSP27 mixtures reduced small and large dextran molecule permeability across BECs\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Clostridium perfringens is one of the most widely distributed and successful pathogens. It causes multiple severe diseases in animals and humans and produces an impressive arsenal of toxins with pore-forming properties, most of them belonging to the hemolysin-like family of {beta}-pore forming toxins ({beta}-PFTs). One of the most potent toxins produced by C. perfringens is {beta}-toxin (CPB). This toxin is the main virulence factor of type C strains and essential for the development of a fatal necrotic enteritis in humans and newborn animals. In the present study, we describe the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of CPB in styrene maleic acid (SMA) discs, which represents the membrane-inserted pore form, at near atomic resolution. We show that CPB forms a homo-oligomeric pore with eightfold symmetry and similar conformation to the hetero-oligomeric pores of the bi-component leukocidins, with important differences in the receptor binding region and the N-terminal latch domain. Intriguingly, the octameric CPB pore complex contains a second 16-stranded {beta}-barrel protrusion atop of the cap domain that is formed by the N-termini of the eight protomers. We propose that CPB defines a new subclass of the hemolysin-like family of {beta}-PFTs s. In addition, we show that the {beta}-barrel protrusion domain can be changed or modified without affecting the pore forming ability, thus making the pore particularly attractive for macromolecule sensing and nanotechnology. The cryo-EM structure of the octameric pore of CPB will facilitate future developments in both nanotechnology and basic research.",

    "abstract": "While in vivo calcium imaging makes it possible to record activity in defined neuronal populations with cellular resolution, optogenetics allows selective manipulation of neural activity. Recently, these two tools have been combined to stimulate and record neural activity at the same time, but current approaches often rely on two-photon microscopes that are difficult to use in freely moving animals, or one-photon fiberscopes with benchtop-based digital micromirror devices that limit system portability. To address these limitations, we have developed a new integrated system combining a one-photon endoscope and a digital micromirror device for simultaneous calcium imaging and precise optogenetic photo-stimulation (Miniscope with All-optical Patterned Stimulation and Imaging, MAPSI). Using this system, we were able to successfully image striatal neurons from either the direct pathway or the indirect pathway while simultaneously activating any neuron of choice within the field of view or synthesizing arbitrary spatio-temporal patterns of photo-stimulation in freely moving mice. We could also select neurons based on their relationship with behavior and recreate the behavior by mimicking the natural neural activity with photo-stimulation. MAPSI thus provides a powerful tool for in vivo interrogation of neural circuit function.",

    "abstract": "A major limitation of large-scale neuronal recordings is the difficulty in locating homologous neurons in different subjects, referred to as the \"correspondence\" issue. This issue stems, at least in part, from the lack of a unique feature that unequivocally identifies each neuron. One promising approach to this problem is the functional neurocartography framework developed by Frady et al. (2016), in which neurons are identified by a semisupervised machine learning algorithm using a combination of multiple selected features. Here, the framework was adapted to the buccal ganglia of Aplysia. Multiple features were derived from neuronal activity during motor pattern generation, responses to peripheral nerve stimulation, and the spatial properties of each cell. The feature set was optimized based on its potential usefulness in discriminating neurons from each other, and then used to match putatively homologous neurons across subjects with the functional neurocartography software. An alternative matching method based on a cyclic matching algorithm was also developed, which allows for unsupervised extraction of groups of neurons and automated selection of high-quality matches. This improvement enabled unsupervised implementation of the machine learning algorithm, thereby enhancing scalability of the analysis. This study paves the way for investigating the roles of both well-characterized and previously uncharacterized neurons in Aplysia, and helps to adapt the neurocartography framework to other systems.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic regulatory mechanisms allow multicellular organisms to develop distinct specialized cell identities despite having the same total genome. Cell-fate choices are based on gene expression programs and environmental cues that cells experience during embryonic development, and are usually maintained throughout the life of the organism despite new environmental cues. The evolutionarily conserved Polycomb group (PcG) proteins form Polycomb Repressive Complexes that help orchestrate these developmental choices. Post-development, these complexes actively maintain the resulting cell fate, even in the face of environmental perturbations. Given the crucial role of these polycomb mechanisms in providing phenotypic fidelity (i.e. maintenance of cell fate), we hypothesize that their dysregulation after development will lead to decreased phenotypic fidelity allowing dysregulated cells to sustainably switch their phenotype in response to environmental changes. We call this abnormal phenotypic switching phenotypic pliancy. We introduce a general computational evolutionary model that allows us to test our systems-level phenotypic pliancy hypothesis in-silico and in a context-independent manner. We find that 1) phenotypic fidelity is an emergent systems-level property of PcG-like mechanism evolution, and 2) phenotypic pliancy is an emergent systems-level property resulting from this mechanisms dysregulation. Since there is evidence that metastatic cells behave in a phenotypically pliant manner, we hypothesize that progression to metastasis is driven by the emergence of phenotypic pliancy in cancer cells as a result of PcG mechanism dysregulation. We corroborate our hypothesis using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from metastatic cancers. We find that metastatic cancer cells are phenotypically pliant in the same manner as predicted by our model.\n\nSignificance StatementWe introduce the concept of cellular phenotypic pliancy- sustained abnormal phenotypic switching in response to environmental changes- and demonstrate that such behavior can be caused by dysregulation of Polycomb mechanisms. To overcome the incomplete knowledge about these mechanisms in higher organisms, we develop an abstract computational model to study the emergence of phenotypic pliancy from a general systems-level view by confirming our hypothesis over a wide range of simulated gene-regulatory networks and Polycomb mechanism patterns. We corroborate our hypothesis and model predictions using single-cell RNA-seq metastatic cancer datasets. Our hypothesis has the potential to shed light on a general phenomenon for complex diseases where abnormal phenotypic switching is relevant.",

Disruption of genes in the network can interrupt normal development and cause diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-a chronic lung disease in preterm infants with morbid and sometimes lethal consequences characterized by lung immaturity and reduced alveolarization.\n\nHere, we generated a transgenic mouse exhibiting a moderate severity BPD phenotype by blocking IGF1 signaling in secondary crest myofibroblasts (SCMF) at the onset of alveologenesis. Using approaches mirroring the construction of the model GRN in sea urchins development, we constructed the IGF1 signaling network underlying alveologenesis using this mouse model that phenocopies BPD. The constructed GRN, consisting of 43 genes, provides a birds-eye view of how the genes downstream of IGF1 are regulatorily connected. The GRN also reveals a mechanistic interpretation of how the effects of IGF1 signaling are transduced within SCMF from its specification genes to its effector genes and then from SCMF to its neighboring alveolar epithelial cells with WNT5A and FGF10 signaling as the bridge. Consistently, blocking WNT5A signaling in mice phenocopies BPD as inferred by the network. A comparative study on human samples suggests that a GRN of similar components and wiring underlies human BPD.\n\nOur network view of alveologenesis is transforming our perspective to understand and treat BPD. This new perspective calls for the construction of the full signaling GRN underlying alveologenesis, upon which targeted therapies for this neonatal chronic lung disease can be viably developed.",

    "abstract": "Modern high-throughput biological systems detection methods generate empirical frequency distributions (EFD) which exhibit complex forms and have long right-side tails. Such EFD are often observed in normal and pathological processes, of which the probabilistic properties are essential, but the underlying probability mechanisms are poorly understood. To better understand the probability mechanisms driving biological complexity and the pathological role of extreme values, we propose that the observed skewed discrete distributions are generated by non-linear transition rates of birth and death processes (BDPs). We introduce a (3d+1)-parameter Generalized Gaussian Hypergeometric Probability ((3d+1)-GHP) model with the probabilities defined by a stationary solution of generalized BDP (g-BDP) and represented by generalized hypergeometric series with regularly varying function properties. We study the Regularly Varying 3d-Parameter Generalized Gaussian Hypergeometric Probability (3d-RGHP) functions regular variation properties, asymptotically constant slow varying component, unimodality and upward/ downward convexity which allows us to specify a family of 3d-RGHP models and study their analytical and numerical characteristics. The frequency distribution of unique muta-tions occurring in the human genome of patients with melanoma have been analyzed as an example application of our theory in bioinformatics. The results show that the parameterized model not only fits the  heavy tail well, but also the entire EFD taken on the complete experimental outcome space. Our model provides a rigorous and flexible mathematical framework for analysis and application of skewed distributions generated by BDPs which often occur in bioinformatics and big data science.",

    "abstract": "Targeted sequencing significantly improves accuracy and coverage and aids in providing the depth necessary to detect rare alleles in a heterogenous population of cells. Until the introduction of nanopore Cas9 Targeted-Sequencing (nCATS), a lack of efficient long-read compatible targeting techniques made it difficult to study specific regions of interest on long-read platforms. Existing nCATS-based strategies are currently limited by the per molecule target lengths capturable (<30kb), requiring several Cas9 guides to tile across larger regions of interest, ultimately reducing the number of targets that can be surveyed per reaction. Also, longer read lengths help reduce mapping errors, making it more likely that complex structural rearrangements can be resolved. Absence of a background reduction step in nCATS also increases the competition between non-target and target fragments in the sequencing pool for pore occupancy, decreasing the overall percentage of on-target reads. To address this, we introduce ACME - an Affinity-based Cas9-Mediated Enrichment method - that helps reduce background reads, increasing on-target coverage and size of target regions that can be spanned with single reads to 100kb.\n\nACME uses a HisTag-based isolation and pulldown of Cas-9 bound non-target reads, reducing the background noise in sequencing. We designed a panel of guide RNAs targeting 10 genes to enrich for specific regions of the cancer genome and tested them in two breast cell lines - MCF 10A and SK-BR-3. These gene targets spanned different size ranges (10kb to 150kb) allowing us to identify the largest target sizes that could be optimally captured by single molecules spanning the entire region. When compared with using just nCATS, the ACME method for background reduction increased the overall coverage across the entire length of all targets by 2-fold to 25-fold. By using ACME to eliminate smaller competing non-targets from the sequencing library, we saw a 3- to 7-fold increase in the number of reads spanning 100% of the gene targets when compared to nCATS. For one of our larger targets, BRCA2, we observed >60-fold target enrichment, close to 70x coverage, and 3-20 reads spanning the entire 95kb target. We observed an increase in enrichment, depth, and number of whole gene spanning reads for other genes on the panel as well across both cell lines, with enrichment as high as 4000-fold for some genes. Furthermore, ACME identified all SVs previously called within our targets by ONT and PacBio whole genome sequencing and performed on par with these platforms for SNP detection when compared with Illumina short-read whole genome sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a key process in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The age-dependent decline in retinal autophagy has been associated with photoreceptor degeneration. Retinal dysfunction can also result from damage to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), as the RPE-retina constitutes an important metabolic ecosystem that must be finely tuned to preserve visual function. While studies of mice lacking essential autophagy genes have revealed a predisposition to retinal degeneration, the consequences of a moderate reduction in autophagy, similar to that which occurs during physiological aging, remain unclear. Here, we describe a retinal phenotype consistent with accelerated aging in mice carrying a haploinsufficiency for Ambra1, a pro-autophagic gene. These mice show protein aggregation in the retina and RPE, metabolic underperformance, and premature vision loss. Moreover, Ambra1+/gt mice are more prone to retinal degeneration after RPE stress. These findings indicate that autophagy provides crucial support to RPE-retinal metabolism and protects the retina against stress and physiological aging.",

    "abstract": "XIST RNA triggers gene silencing chromosome-wide and transforms a euchromatic chromosome into a condensed Barr body. XIST is heavily studied in mouse ES cells, but here an inducible iPSC system allows analysis of initial steps in human chromosome silencing, revealing key points not known in either system. XIST RNA distribution was examined relative to biochemical and transcriptional changes directly within architecture of individual chromosome territories. Within a few hours of induction, XIST transcripts distribute as a large \"sparse zone\" and a smaller \"dense zone\", which, importantly, exhibit different effects on chromatin. Very sparse transcripts immediately trigger bright staining for H2AK119ub and CIZ1, a structural matrix protein. In contrast, H3K27me3 enrichment comes hours later and is much more restricted to the smaller dense RNA zone, which enlarges as the chromosome condenses. Importantly, silencing of several genes examined occurred well after architectural condensation, suggesting a possibly separable step. Surprisingly, we show the small A-repeat fragment of XIST can alone silence endogenous genes; however, results indicate this requires high local RNA density for effective histone deacetylation. Results support a concept whereby XIST RNA acts directly to condense the chromosome territory, comprised largely of non-coding DNA, which facilitates a required step to initiate gene silencing by the A-repeat. Hence, compacted architecture is not a consequence of collective gene silencing, but an early step required for chromosome-wide gene silencing.",

    "abstract": "RFC uses ATP to assemble PCNA onto primed sites for replicative DNA polymerases {delta} and {varepsilon}. The RFC pentamer forms a central chamber that binds 3 ss/ds DNA junctions to load PCNA onto DNA during replication. We show here five structures that identify a 2nd DNA binding site in RFC that binds a 5 duplex. This 5 DNA site is located between the N-terminal BRCT domain and AAA+ module of the large Rfc1 subunit. Our structures reveal ideal binding to a 7-nt gap, which includes 2 bp unwound by the clamp loader. Biochemical studies show enhanced binding to 5 and 10 nt gaps, consistent with the structural results. Because both 3 and 5 ends are present at a ssDNA gap, we propose that the 5 site facilitates RFCs PCNA loading activity at a DNA damage-induced gap to recruit gap-filling polymerases. These findings are consistent with genetic studies showing that base excision repair of gaps greater than 1 base requires PCNA and involves the 5 DNA binding domain of Rfc1. We further observe that a 5 end facilitates PCNA loading at an RPA coated 30-nt gap, suggesting a potential role of the RFC 5-DNA site in lagging strand DNA synthesis",

However, two limitations prevent the broader application of plasmonic single-molecule imaging. One is the heating effect accompanying the plasmonic enhancement, and the other is the complicated system structure resulting from the two-objective optical arrangement. Here, we report single-objective evanescent scattering microscopy. The evanescent field is created by total internal reflection instead of the surface plasmon resonance on the gold film. As a result, the sensing substrate without gold film produces little heat, and allows excitation and observation using one objective. In addition, this system enables quantification of protein binding kinetics by simultaneously counting the binding of individual molecules and recording their binding sites with nanometer precision, providing a digital method to measure binding kinetics with high spatiotemporal resolution.

    "abstract": "The 20S proteasome Core Particle (CP) is a molecular machine that is a key component of cellular protein degradation pathways. Like other molecular machines, it is not synthesized in an active form, but rather as a set of subunits that assemble into a functional complex. The CP is conserved across all domains of life and is composed of 28 subunits, 14  and 14 {beta}, arranged in four stacked 7-member rings (7{beta}7{beta}77). While details of CP assembly vary across species, the final step in the assembly process is universally conserved: two half proteasomes (HP: 7{beta}7) dimerize to form the CP. In the bacterium Rhodococcus erythropolis, experiments have shown that the formation of the HP is completed within minutes, while the dimerization process takes hours. The N-terminal propeptide of the {beta} subunit, which is autocatalytically cleaved off after CP formation, plays a key role in regulating this separation of time scales. However, the detailed molecular mechanism of how the propeptide achieves this regulation is unclear. In this work, we used Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize HP conformations and found that the HP exists in two states: one where the propeptide interacts with key residues in the HP dimerization interface and likely blocks dimerization, and one where this interface is free. We found that a propeptide mutant that dimerizes extremely slowly is essentially always in the non-dimerizable state, while the WT rapidly transitions between the two. Based on these simulations, we designed a propeptide mutant that favored the dimerizable state in MD simulations. In vitro assembly experiments confirmed that this mutant dimerizes significantly faster than WT. Our work thus provides unprecedented insight into how this critical step in CP assembly is regulated, with implications both for efforts to inhibit proteasome assembly and for the evolution of hierarchical assembly pathways.",

    "abstract": "The Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) is a photoactive protein involved in cyanobacterial photoprotection, by quenching of the excess of light harvested energy. The photoactivation mechanism remains elusive, in part due to absence of data pertaining to the timescales over which protein structural changes take place. It also remains unclear whether or not oligomerization of the dark-adapted and light-adapted OCP could play a role in the regulation of its energy quenching activity. Here, we probed photo-induced structural changes in OCP by a combination of static and time-resolved X-ray scattering and steady-state and transient optical spectroscopy in the visible range. Our results suggest that oligomerization partakes in regulation of the OCP photocycle, with different oligomers slowing down the overall thermal recovery of the dark-adapted state of OCP. They furthermore reveal that upon non-photoproductive excitation, a numbed-state forms, which remains in a non-photoexcitable structural state for at least [~]0.5 {micro}s after absorption of a first photon.\n\nSignificance StatementThe orange carotenoid protein (OCP) is a photoactivatable protein involved in cyanobacterial photoprotection. Upon photoactivation, OCP becomes able to quench the excess of energy uptaken by the light-harvesting antennae, thereby evading damage to the cells. It remains unclear, however, what is the exact OCP photoactivation mechanism, and whether or not oligomerization partakes in the regulation of the OCP function. Here, we investigated these issues by combining static and time-resolved (TR) X-ray scattering and optical spectroscopy. Our results show that OCP oligomerizes in both the dark-adapted inactive and light-adapted active states, suggesting a functional role for oligomerization. TR scattering data furthermore reveal that the first large-scale conformational changes associated with OCP photoactivation take place on the {micro}s time scale.",

However, their contributions to acute infection in the aged and their developmental pathways are unclear. We find that the response against influenza A virus infection in aged mice is dominated by a Fas+GL7- effector B cell population we call infection-induced-ABC (iABC). Most iABC express IgM and include antibody-secreting cells in the spleen, lung and bone marrow. We find that in response to influenza, IgD+CD21-CD23-ABC are the precursors of iABC. These IgD+ABC develop in germ free mice, so are independent of foreign antigen recognition, suggesting they arise from an intrinsic age-associated developmental program. The response of ABC to influenza infection, resulting in iABC, is T cell independent and requires both extrinsic TLR7 and TLR9 signals. In response to influenza infection, IgD+ABC can induce a faster recovery of weight and higher total anti-influenza IgG and IgM titers that can neutralize virus. Immunization with whole inactivated virus also generates iABC in aged mice. Thus, in unimmunized aged mice, whose other B and T cell responses have waned, IgD+ABC are likely the naive B cells with the potential to become Ab-secreting cells and to provide protection from infection in the aged.",

Many of the signaling mechanisms that underlie mechanotransduction by endothelial cells are inadequately defined.\n\nObjectiveWe sought to better understand how {beta}-arrestins, intracellular proteins that regulate agonist-mediated desensitization and integration of signaling by transmembrane receptors, may be involved in the endothelial cell response to shear stress.\n\nMethods and ResultsIn vitro studies with primary endothelial cells subjected to {beta}-arrestin knockdown, and in vivo studies using mice with endothelial specific deletion of {beta}-arrestin 1 and {beta}-arrestin 2 were conducted. We found that {beta}-arrestins are localized to primary cilia in endothelial cells, which are present in subpopulations of endothelial cells in relatively low shear states. Recruitment of {beta}-arrestins to cilia involved its interaction with IFT81, a component of the flagellar transport protein complex in the cilia. {beta}-arrestin knockdown led to marked reduction in shear stress response, including induction of NOS3 expression. Within the cilia, {beta}-arrestins were found to associate with the type II bone morphogenetic protein receptor (BMPR-II), whose disruption similarly led to an impaired endothelial shear response. {beta}-arrestins also regulated Smad transcription factor phosphorylation by BMPR-II. Mice with endothelial specific deletion of {beta}-arrestin 1 and {beta}-arrestin 2 were found to have impaired retinal angiogenesis.\n\nConclusionWe have identified a novel role for endothelial {beta}-arrestins as key transducers of ciliary mechanotransduction that play a central role in shear signaling by BMPR-II and contribute to vascular development.\n\nNOVELTY AND SIGNIFICANCE\n\nWhat Is Known?O_LIEndothelial cells respond to flow-induced shear stress with biochemical changes, such as phosphorylation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, that promote morphological changes, such as cell alignment.\nC_LIO_LIThe endothelial response to shear stress can involve primary cilia, microtubule-based sensory organelles that detect extracellular stimuli and generates intracellular signals.\nC_LIO_LIThe specific ciliary signaling pathways that regulate endothelial mechanotransduction have not been fully elucidated.\nC_LI\n\nWhat New Information Does This Article Contribute?O_LI{beta}-arrestins directly interact with the ciliary protein intraflagellar transport protein 81 (IFT81), which is present in the primary cilia of endothelial cells, and are required for the morphological response to flow-induced shear stress.\nC_LIO_LI{beta}-arrestins regulates type II bone morphogenetic protein receptor signaling, which is required for the endothelial response to shear stress, and is required for the phosphorylation of Smad transcription factors.\nC_LIO_LI{beta}-arrestins are required for endothelial nitric oxide synthase-mediated flow-induced shear stress response in endothelial cells.\nC_LIO_LIEndothelial cell-specific knockout of {beta}-arrestins results in abnormal vascular development, with a loss of vessel length and branchpoints.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Modern, high-density neuronal recordings reveal at ever higher precision how information is represented by neural populations. Still, we lack the tools to understand these processes bottom-up, emerging from the biophysical properties of neurons, synapses, and network structure. The concept of the dynamic gain function, a spectrally resolved approximation of a populations coding capability, has the potential to link cell-level properties to network-level performance. However, the dynamic gains shape is co-determined by axonal and somatodendritic parameters and the populations operating regime. Previously, this complexity precluded an understanding of any individual parameters impact. Here, we decomposed the dynamic gain function into three components corresponding to separate signal transformations. This allowed attribution of network-level encoding features to specific cell-level parameters. Applying the method to data from real neurons and biophysically plausible models, we found: 1. The encoding bandwidth of real neurons, approximately 400 Hz, is constrained by the voltage dependence of axonal currents during early action potential initiation. 2. State-of-the-art models only achieve encoding bandwidths around 100 Hz and are limited mainly by subthreshold processes instead. 3. Large dendrites and low-threshold potassium currents modulate the bandwidth by shaping the subthreshold stimulus-to-voltage transformation. Our decomposition provides physiological interpretations when the dynamic gain curve changes, for instance during spectrinopathies and neurodegeneration. By pinpointing shortcomings of current models, it also guides inference of neuron models best suited for large-scale network simulations.\n\nAuthor summaryThe dynamic gain function quantifies how neurons can engage in collective, networklevel activity, shape brain rhythms and information encoding. Its shape results from a complex interaction between properties of different molecules (ion channels) and cell compartments (morphology, resistance), and is so far only understood for the simplest neuron models. Here we provide an interpretable analysis, decomposing the dynamic gain based on the stimulus transformation steps in individual neurons. We apply the decomposition to data from real neurons and complex models, and attribute changes of the dynamic gain to specific sub- and suprathreshold processes. Using this decomposition method, we reveal the relevance of subthreshold potassium channels for ultrafast information encoding and expose the shortcomings of even the state-of-the-art neuron models.",

    "abstract": "That sensory neurons alone transduce mechanical stimuli was challenged by the discovery of nociceptive Schwann cells that can initiate pain. Consistent with the existence of inherently mechanosensitive sensory Schwann cells, we found that the mechanosensory function of almost all nociceptors, including those signaling fast pain, were critically dependent on sensory Schwann cells. Furthermore, in polymodal nociceptors, sensory Schwann cells signal mechanical, but not cold or heat pain. Terminal Schwann cells also surround mechanoreceptor nerve-endings within the Meissners corpuscle and in at hair follicle lanceolate endings that both signal vibrotactile touch. Within Meissners corpuscles, two molecularly and functionally distinct sensory Schwann cells positive for Sox10 and Sox2 differentially modulate rapidly adapting mechanoreceptor function. Using optogenetics we show that Meissners corpuscle Schwann cells are necessary for the perception of low threshold vibrotactile stimuli. These results show that sensory Schwann cells within diverse glio-neural mechanosensory end-organs are sensors for mechanical pain as well as necessary for touch perception. Thus, specialized sensory Schwann are central to the transduction of mechanical forces that underpin somatic sensation.",

    "abstract": "In many metazoans, centromeres are embedded in large blocks of highly repetitive (peri-) centromeric heterochromatin from which non-coding RNAs emanate that have been assigned diverse functions in different species. However, little is known about their functional details or regulation. The pericentromere of the X chromosome in Drosophila melanogaster contains a multi mega-base array of the 359 bp satellite repeats from the 1.688 family, which is transcribed into a lncRNA (SAT III RNA). We performed a SAT III RNA pulldown assay and identified a SAT III RNA-associated complex of four previously uncharacterized proteins and show that they affect germline development. These factors not only interact with each other and with SAT III RNA but also co-regulate each other. RNAi depletion of any of the factors leads to severe defects in the developing germline and sterility. Moreover, we show that the complex plays a crucial role in SAT III RNA repression, as RNAi depletion of the factors leads to a drastic increase of SAT III RNA levels. Importantly, genetic reduction of SAT III RNA level in the RNAi-depleted flies partially rescued the germ line defects and infertility phenotype. Based on our results we hypothesize that the identified complex functions in the germline to regulate SAT III RNA levels, possibly to offset effects of chromatin remodelling taking place in the developing germline.",

To define the contribution of interferon receptor overexpression to Down syndrome phenotypes, we used genome editing to correct interferon receptor gene dosage in mice carrying triplication of a large genomic region orthologous to human chromosome 21. Normalization of interferon receptor copy number attenuated lethal antiviral responses, prevented heart malformations, decreased developmental delays, improved cognition and normalized craniofacial anomalies.

During transcription initiation, RNAP II opens the double-stranded DNA to expose the DNA template to the active site. The molecular interactions driving and controlling the DNA opening are not well understood. We used all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain a continuous atomistic pathway for the DNA opening process in human RNAP II. To achieve such large-scale and highly nonlinear transition, we steered the MD simulations along a combination of collective variables involving a guided DNA rotation and a set of path collective variables. The simulations reveal extensive interactions of the DNA with three protein loops near the active site, namely the rudder, fork loop 1, and fork loop 2. According to the simulations, these DNA-protein interactions support DNA opening by attacking Watson-Crick hydrogen bonds, and they stabilize the open DNA bubble by the formation of a wide set of DNA-protein salt bridges.",

    "abstract": "Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome is a premature aging disease caused by LMNA gene mutation and the production of a truncated lamin A protein \"progerin\" that elicits cellular and organismal toxicity. Progerin accumulates in the vasculature, being especially toxic for vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Patients autopsies show that vessel stiffening, and aortic atherosclerosis is accompanied by VSMC depletion in the medial layer, altered extracellular matrix (ECM), and thickening of the adventitial layer. Mechanisms whereby progerin causes massive VSMC loss and vessel alterations remain poorly understood. Mature VSMC retain phenotypic plasticity and can switch to a synthetic/proliferative phenotype. Here we show that progerin expression in human and mouse VSMC causes a switch towards the synthetic/proliferative phenotype. This switch elicits some level of replication stress in normal cells, which is exacerbated in the presence of progerin, leading to telomere fragility, genomic instability, and ultimately VSMC death. Importantly, calcitriol prevents replication stress, telomere fragility, and genomic instability, reducing VSMC death. In addition, RNAseq analysis shows induction of a profibrotic and proinflammatory aging-associated secretory phenotype upon progerin expression in human primary VSMC. Our data suggest that phenotypic switch-induced replication stress might be an underlying cause of VSMC loss in progeria, which together with loss of contractile features and gain of profibrotic and proinflammatory signatures contribute to vascular stiffness in HGPS. Preventing the phenotypic switch-induced replication stress with compounds such as calcitriol might ameliorate CVD in HGPS patients.",

    "abstract": "Biological invasions are usually examined in the context of their impacts on native species. However, few studies have examined the dynamics between invaders when multiple exotic species successfully coexist in a novel environment. Yet, long-term coexistence of now established exotic species has been observed in North American lady beetle communities. Exotic lady beetles Harmonia axyridis and Coccinella septempunctata were introduced for biological control in agricultural systems and have since become dominant species within these communities. In this study, we investigated coexistence via spatial and temporal niche partitioning among H. axyridis and C. septempunctata using a 31-year dataset from southwestern Michigan, USA. We found evidence of long-term coexistence through a combination of small-scale environmental, habitat, and seasonal mechanisms. Across years, H. axyridis and C. septempunctata experienced patterns of cyclical dominance likely related to yearly variation in temperature and precipitation. Within years, populations of C. septempunctata peaked early in the growing season at 550 degree days, while H. axyridis populations grew in the season until 1250 degree days, and continued to have high activity after this point. Coccinella septempunctata was generally most abundant in herbaceous crops, whereas H. axyridis did not display strong habitat preferences. These findings suggest that within this region H. axyridis has broader habitat and abiotic environmental preferences, while C. septempunctata thrives under more specific ecological conditions. These ecological differences have contributed to the continued coexistence among these two invaders. Understanding mechanisms that allow coexistence of dominant exotic species contributes to native biodiversity conservation management of invaded ecosystems.\n\nOpen research statementData are already published and publicly available, with those items properly cited in this submission.

    "abstract": "Predictive breeding is now widely practised in crop improvement programs and has accelerated selection response (i.e., the amount of genetic gain between breeding cycles) for complex traits. However, world food production needs to increase further to meet the demands of the growing human population. The prediction of complex traits with current methods can be inconsistent across different genetic, environmental, and agronomic management contexts because the complex relationships between genomic and phenotypic variation are not well accounted for. Therefore, developing gene-to-phenotype network models for traits that integrate the knowledge of networks from systems biology, plant and crop physiology with population genomics has been proposed to close this gap in predictive modelling. Here, we develop a gene-to-phenotype network for shoot branching, a critical developmental pathway underpinning harvestable yield for many crop species, as a case study to explore the value of developing gene-to-phenotype networks to enhance understanding of selection responses. We observed that genetic canalization is an emergent property of the complex interactions among shoot branching gene-to-phenotype network components, leading to the accumulation of cryptic genetic variation, reduced selection responses, and large variation in selection trajectories across populations. As genetic canalization is expected to be pervasive in traits, such as grain yield, that result from interactions among multiple genes, traits, environments, and agronomic management practices, the need to model traits in crop improvement programs as outcomes of gene-to-phenotype networks is highlighted as an emerging opportunity to advance our understanding of selection response and the efficiency of developing resilient crops for future climates.",

Here, we show that Rtt105 binds to multiple DNA binding and protein-interaction domains of RPA and configurationally staples the complex. In the absence of ssDNA, Rtt105 inhibits RPA binding to Rad52, thus preventing spurious binding to RPA-interacting proteins (RIPs). When ssDNA is available, Rtt105 promotes formation of high-density RPA nucleoprotein filaments and dissociates during this process. Free Rtt105 further stabilizes the RPA-ssDNA filaments by inhibiting RPA facilitated exchange. Collectively, our data suggest that Rtt105 sequesters free RPA in the nucleus to prevent untimely RIP interaction, while stabilizing RPA-ssDNA filaments at DNA lesion sites.",

    "abstract": "A standard unsupervised analysis is to cluster observations into discrete groups using a dissimilarity measure, such as Euclidean distance. If there does not exist a ground-truth label for each observation necessary for external validity metrics, then internal validity metrics, such as the tightness or consistency of the cluster, are often used. However, the interpretation of these internal metrics can be problematic when using different dissimilarity measures as they have different magnitudes and ranges of values that they span. To address this problem, previous work introduced the  scale-agnostic G+ discordance metric, however this internal metric is slow to calculate for large data. Furthermore, we show that G+ varies as a function of the proportion of observations in the predicted cluster labels (group balance), which is an undesirable property.\n\nTo address this problem, we propose a modification of G+, referred to as H+, and demonstrate that H+ does not vary as a function of group balance using a simulation study and with public single-cell RNA-sequencing data. Finally, we provide scalable approaches to estimate H+, which are available in the fasthplus R package.",

    "abstract": "Predicting the structure (or pose) of RNA-ligand complexes is an important problem in RNA structural biology and drug discovery. Although one could use molecular docking procedures to rapidly sample putative poses of RNA-ligand complexes, accurately dis-criminating the native-like poses from non-native, decoy structures remains a formidable challenge. Here, we started from the assumption that native-like RNA-ligand poses are less likely to dissociate during molecular dynamics simulations, and then we used enhanced simulations to promote ligand for diverse poses of a handful of RNA-ligand complexes. By fitting unbinding profiles obtained from the simulations to a single-exponential, we identified the characteristic decay time ({tau}) as particularly effective at resolving native poses from decoys. Remarkably, a simple regression model trained to predict the simulation-derived parameters directly from structure could also discriminate poses. As such, when molecular dynamics simulations are feasible, one could use them to simulate ligand unbinding to aid in the identification of near-native poses. On the other hand, when speed is more important, one could use a simple structure-based regression model, like the ones described in this study, to analyze and filter RNA-ligand poses.",

Therefore, there is a critical need to identify early non-invasive biomarkers of response. We performed plasma proteomic analysis (>700 proteins) at three timepoints on 174 metastatic melanoma patients treated with ICB. We leverage independent training and testing cohorts to build a predictor of immunotherapy response that outperforms several tissue-based approaches. We found 217 differentially expressed proteins between ICB responders (R) and non-responders (NR), including a co-regulated module of proteins enriched in certain NR patients. By analyzing single-cell RNA-sequencing data of tumor biopsies from 32 patients, we dissected the relative contribution of cells in the tumor to proteins in circulation. The majority of proteins in the co-regulated NR module derived from tumor and myeloid cells. Amongst myeloid cells, we identified a subset of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) with a suppressive phenotype that expressed high levels of the co-regulated NR module, thus suggesting they are key drivers of non-response signatures. Together, our data demonstrates the utility of plasma proteomics in biomarker discovery and in understanding the biology of host response to tumors.",

However, a lack of information about network structure of NAc top-down afference has limited our understanding of mechanisms of these functions. Here, we systematically analyzed whole brain patterns of inputs to mPFC/HPC/BL-NAc projectors via using (TRIO) labeling strategy. We found that the upstream input patterns between mPFC-core and mPFC-shell projections, BL-core and BL-shell projections, HPC-core and HPC-shell projections were similar. The projections from mPFC and BL to NAc receive a wide range of inputs, while the projections from HPC to NAc receive convergent inputs. Furthermore, all of mPFC/HPC/BL-NAc projectors receive considerable inputs from respective local regions. This study lays a foundation for further analysis of complex NAc functional mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampal CA2 region, an area important for social memory, has been suspected to play a role in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) because of its resistance to the degeneration observed in neighboring CA1 and CA3 regions in both human and rodent models of TLE. However, little is known about whether alterations in CA2 properties serve to promote seizure generation or propagation. Here we have used the pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (PILO-SE) model of TLE to explore the role of CA2. Ex vivo electrophysiological recordings from acute hippocampal slices revealed a set of coordinated changes that enhance CA2 intrinsic excitability, reduce CA2 local inhibitory input, and increase CA2 excitatory output to its major CA1 synaptic target. Moreover, selective silencing of CA2 pyramidal cells using a chemogenetic approach caused a significant decrease in the frequency of spontaneous seizures. These findings provide the first evidence that CA2 actively contributes to TLE seizure activity and may thus be a promising therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Necrotrophic mycoparasitism is an intricate process involving recognition, physical mycelial contact and killing of host fungi (mycohosts). During such interactions, mycoparasites undergo a complex developmental process involving massive regulatory changes of gene expression to produce a range of chemical compounds and proteins that contribute to the parasitism of the mycohosts. Small-RNAs (sRNAs) are vital components of post-transcriptional gene regulation, although their role in gene expression regulation during mycoparasitism remain understudied. Here, we investigated the role of sRNA-mediated gene regulation in mycoparasitism by performing sRNA and degradome tags sequencing of the mycoparasitic fungus Clonostachys rosea interacting with the plant pathogenic mycohosts Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium graminearum at two time points. The majority of differentially expressed sRNAs were down-regulated during the interactions with the mycohosts compared to a C. rosea self-interaction control, thus allowing de-suppression (up-regulation) of mycohost-responsive genes. Degradome analysis showed a positive correlation between high degradome counts and antisense sRNA mapping and led to the identification of 201 sRNA-mediated gene targets for 282 differentially expressed sRNAs. Analysis of sRNA gene targets revealed that the regulation of genes coding for membrane proteins was a common response against both mycohosts. While the regulation of genes involved in oxidative stress tolerance and cellular metabolic and biosynthetic processes was exclusive against F. graminearum highlighting common and mycohosts-specific gene regulation of C. rosea. By combining these results with transcriptome data collected in similar experimental conditions during a previous study, we expand the understanding of the role of sRNA in regulating interspecific fungal interactions and mycoparasitism.\n\nImportanceSmall-RNAs (sRNAs) are emerging as key players in pathogenic and symbiotic fungus-plant interactions, however, their role in fungal-fungal interactions remains elusive. In this study, we employed the necrotrophic mycoparasite Clonostachys rosea and plant pathogenic mycohots Botrytis cinerea and Fusarium graminearum and investigated the sRNA-mediated gene regulation in mycoparasitic interactions. The combined approach of sRNA and degradome tag sequencing identified 201 sRNA-mediated putative gene targets for 282 differentially expressed sRNAs highlighting the role of sRNA-mediated regulation of mycoparasitism in C. rosea. We also identified 36 known and 13 novel miRNAs and their potential gene targets at endogenous level, and at a cross-species level in B. cinerea and F. graminearum indicating a role of cross-species RNAi in mycoparasitism, representing a novel mechanism in biocontrol interactions. Furthermore, we showed that C. rosea adapts its transcriptional response, and thereby its interaction mechanisms, based on the interaction stages and identity of the mycohost.",

Metabolic theory predicts that mixotrophs will become more heterotrophic with rising temperatures, potentially creating a positive feedback loop that accelerates carbon dioxide accumulation in the atmosphere. Studies testing this theory have focused on phenotypically plastic (short-term) thermal responses of mixotrophs. However, as small organisms with short generation times and large population sizes, mixotrophs may rapidly evolve in response to climate change. Here we present data from a 3-year experiment quantifying the evolutionary response of two mixotrophic nanoflagellates to temperature. We found evidence for adaptive evolution through increasing growth rates in the obligately mixotrophic strain, but not in the facultative mixotroph. All lineages showed trends of increased carbon use efficiency, flattening of thermal reaction norms, and a return to homeostatic gene expression. Generally, mixotrophs evolved reduced photosynthesis and higher grazing with increased temperatures, suggesting that evolution may act to exacerbate mixotrophs effects on global carbon cycling.",

    "abstract": "The fitness effects of all possible mutations available to an organism largely shapes the dynamics of evolutionary adaptation. Tremendous progress has been made in quantifying the strength and abundance of selected mutations available to single microbial species in simple environments, lacking strong ecological interactions. However, the adaptive potential of strains that are part of multi-strain communities remains largely unclear. We sought to fill this gap by analyzing a stable community of two closely related ecotypes (\"L\" and \"S\") shortly after they emerged within the E. coli Long-Term Evolution Experiment (LTEE). We engineered genome-wide barcoded transposon libraries to measure the fitness effects of all possible gene knockouts in the coexisting strains as well as their ancestor, for many different, ecologically relevant conditions. We found that the fitness effects of many gene knockouts sensitively depends on the genetic background and the ecological conditions, as set by the abiotic environment and relative frequency of both ecotypes. Despite the idiosyncratic behavior of individual knockouts, we still see consistent statistical patterns of fitness effect variation across both genetic background and community composition. Genes that are in the same operon, or that strongly interact with each other, are more likely to be correlated with each other across backgrounds compared to random pairs of genes. Additionally, fitness effects are correlated with evolutionary outcomes for a number of conditions, possibly revealing shifting patterns of adaptation. Together, our results reveal how ecological and epistatic effects combine to drive adaptive potential in a nascent ecological community.",

    "abstract": "Adaptations to warming conditions exhibited by ectotherms include increasing heat tolerance but also metabolic changes to reduce maintenance costs (metabolic depression), which can allow them to redistribute the energy surplus to biological functions close to fitness. Currently, there is evidence that energy metabolism evolves in response to warming conditions but we know little about how the rate of temperature change during heat stress determines the evolutionary response of metabolism and the consequences on life-history traits. Here, we evaluated the evolutionary response of energy metabolism (metabolic rate and activity of enzymes of the glucose-6-phosphate branchpoint) and life-history traits to artificial selection for increasing heat tolerance in Drosophila subobscura, using two different thermal selection protocols for heat tolerance: slow and fast ramping protocols. We found that the increase in heat thermal tolerance was associated with a reduction of the hexokinase activity in the slow-ramping selected lines, and a slight reduction of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity in the fast-ramping selected lines. We also found that the evolution of increased heat tolerance increased the early fecundity in selected lines and increased the egg-to-adult viability only in the slow-ramping selected lines. However, heat tolerance evolution was not associated with changes in the metabolic rate in selected populations. This work shows heat tolerance can evolve under different thermal scenarios but with different evolutionary outcomes on associated traits depending on the intensity of thermal stress. Therefore, spatial and temporal variability of thermal stress intensity should be taken into account to understand and predict the adaptive response to ongoing and future climatic conditions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEarly simulations indicated that whole-genome sequence data (WGS) could improve genomic prediction accuracy and its persistence across generations and breeds. However, empirical results have been ambiguous so far. Large data sets that capture most of the genome diversity in a population must be assembled so that allele substitution effects are estimated with high accuracy. The objectives of this study were to use a large pig dataset to assess the benefits of using WGS for genomic prediction compared to using commercial marker arrays, to identify scenarios in which WGS provides the largest advantage, and to identify potential pitfalls for its effective implementation.\n\nMethodsWe sequenced 6,931 individuals from seven commercial pig lines with different numerical size. Genotypes of 32.8 million variants were imputed for 396,100 individuals (17,224 to 104,661 per line). We used BayesR to perform genomic prediction for eight complex traits. Genomic predictions were performed using either data from a marker array or variants preselected from WGS based on association tests.\n\nResultsThe prediction accuracy with each set of preselected WGS variants was not robust across traits and lines and the improvements in prediction accuracy that we achieved so far with WGS compared to marker arrays were generally small. The most favourable results for WGS were obtained when the largest training sets were available and used to preselect variants with statistically significant associations to the trait for augmenting the established marker array. With this method and training sets of around 80k individuals, average improvements of genomic prediction accuracy of 0.025 were observed in within-line scenarios.\n\nConclusionsOur results showed that WGS has a small potential to improve genomic prediction accuracy compared to marker arrays in intensely selected pig lines in some settings. Thus, although we expect that more robust improvements could be attained with a combination of larger training sets and optimised pipelines, the use of WGS in the current implementations of genomic prediction should be carefully evaluated on a case-by-case basis against the cost of generating WGS at a large scale.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM) based on microbubble (MB) localization was recently introduced to overcome the resolution limit of conventional ultrasound. However, ULM is currently challenged by the requirement for long data acquisition times to accumulate adequate MB events to fully reconstruct vasculature. In this study, we present a curvelet transform-based sparsity promoting (CTSP) algorithm that improves ULM imaging speed by recovering missing MB localization signal from data with very short acquisition times. CTSP was first validated in a simulated microvessel model, followed by the chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), and finally, in the mouse brain. In the simulated microvessel study, CTSP robustly recovered the vessel model to achieve an 86.94% vessel filling percentage from a corrupted image with only 4.78% of the true vessel pixels. In the chicken embryo CAM study, CTSP effectively recovered the missing MB signal within the vasculature, leading to marked improvement in ULM imaging quality with a very short data acquisition. Taking the optical image as reference, the vessel filling percentage increased from 2.7% to 42.2% using 50ms of data acquisition after applying CTSP. CTSP used 80% less time to achieve the same 90% maximum saturation level as compared with conventional MB localization. We also applied CTSP on the microvessel flow speed maps and found that CTSP was able to use only 1.6s of microbubble data to recover flow speed images that have similar qualities as those constructed using 33.6s of data. In the mouse brain study, CTSP was able to reconstruct the majority of the cerebral vasculature using 1-2s of data acquisition. Additionally, CTSP only needed 3.2s of microbubble data to generate flow velocity maps that are comparable to those using 129.6s of data. These results suggest that CTSP can facilitate fast and robust ULM imaging especially under the circumstances of inadequate microbubble localizations.",

While high-density electrodes allow for greater spatial resolution, the smaller electrode area translates to a higher impedance and lower SNR. In this study, we developed an implantable and flexible 3D microelectrode array (MEA) with low impedance that enables high-quality EMG recording. With polyimide micro-cones realized by standard photolithography process and PEDOT:PSS coating, this design can increase effective surface area by up to 250% and significantly improve electrical performance for electrode sites with various geometric surface areas, where the electrode impedance is at most improved by 99.3%. Acute EMG activity from mice was recorded by implanting the electrodes in vivo, and we were able to detect multiple individual motor units simultaneously and with high resolution (SNR >> 100). The charge storage capacity was measured to be 34.2 mC/cm2, indicating suitability of the electrodes for stimulation applications as well.",

We demonstrate the performance of CELESTA on multiplexed immunofluorescence in situ images of colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. Using the cell types identified by CELESTA, we identify tissue architecture associated with lymph node metastasis in HNSCC, which we validate in an independent cohort.

    "abstract": "For many human cancers and tumor-associated diseases, mutations in the RAS isoforms (KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS) are the most common oncogenic alterations, making these proteins high-priority therapeutic targets. Effectively targeting the RAS isoforms requires an exact understanding of their active, inactive, and druggable conformations. However, there is no structure-guided catalogue of RAS conformations to guide therapeutic targeting or examining the structural impact of RAS mutations. We present an expanded classification of RAS conformations based on analyzing their catalytic switch 1 (SW1) and switch 2 (SW2) loops. From all 721 available human KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (206 RAS-protein complexes, 190 inhibitor-bound, and 325 unbound, including 204 WT and 517 mutated structures), we created a broad conformational classification based on the spatial positions of residue Y32 in SW1 and residue Y71 in SW2. Subsequently, we defined additional conformational subsets (some previously undescribed) by clustering all well modeled SW1 and SW2 loops using a density-based machine learning algorithm with a backbone dihedral-based distance metric. In all, we identified three SW1 conformations and nine SW2 conformations, each which are associated with different nucleotide states (GTP-bound, nucleotide-free, and GDP-bound) and specific bound proteins or inhibitor sites. The GTP-bound SW1 conformation can be further subdivided based on the hydrogen (H)-bond type made between residue Y32 and the GTP {gamma}-phosphate: water-mediated, direct, or no H-bond. Further analyzing these structures clarified the catalytic impact of the G12D and G12V RAS mutations, and the inhibitor chemistries that bind to each druggable RAS conformation. To facilitate future RAS structural analyses, we have created a web database, called Rascore, presenting an updated and searchable dataset of human KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS structures in the PDB, and which includes a page for analyzing user uploaded RAS structures by our algorithm (http://dunbrack.fccc.edu/rascore/).\n\nSignificanceAnalyzing >700 experimentally determined RAS structures helped define an expanded landscape of active, inactive and druggable RAS conformations, the structural impact of common RAS mutations, and previously uncharacterized RAS-inhibitor binding modes.",

    "abstract": "The MYC oncogene is causally involved in the pathogenesis of most types of human cancer but it remains therapeutically untargeted. The mTORC1 protein complex regulates cap-dependent translation through 4EBP1 and S6K and thereby, downstream MYC protein expression. However, to date, agents such as rapalogs that selectively target mTORC1 (as compared to mTORC2) fail to reactivate 4EBP1 and thus, to block MYC in vivo. In contrast, agents that nonselectively inhibit both protein complexes of the mTOR pathway, mTORC1 and mTORC2, can activate 4EBP1, but often suffer from a lack of tolerability including in vivo hepatotoxicity and immunosuppression. Here, we report the anti-tumor activity of bi-steric mTORC1-selective inhibitors, including Revolution Medicines clinical candidate RMC-5552, that potently and selectively target mTORC1 over mTORC2. In an autochthonous transgenic mouse model of MYC-amplified and MYC-driven hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), representative bi-steric mTORC1-selective inhibitors suppress translation initiation via activation of 4EBP1, thereby suppressing MYC protein expression and blocking tumor growth. Furthermore, in human HCC samples, the low levels of 4EBP1 and MYC is correlated with immune reactivation. Immunohistochemistry, CIBERSORT, and CODEX reveal that selective mTORC1 inhibition results in activation of both CD4+ T cell- and NKp46+ NK cell-mediated immune surveillance. Moreover, bi-steric mTORC1-selective inhibitors synergize with -PD-1 to induce sustained tumor regression, with immune cell degranulation and release of perforins and granzyme B. These agents also exhibit anti-tumor activity in human patient-derived xenografts of HCC, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, and ovarian cancer harboring genomic amplifications in MYC. We infer that selective mTORC1 inhibition is a potential therapeutic strategy to drive effective MYC inactivation in cancer, and the consequent restoration of immune surveillance against neoplasia.",

    "abstract": "There is increasing interest in cancer cell subpopulations that can withstanding treatment via non-genetic mechanisms, such as tumor cell plasticity and adaptation. These cell populations may be comprised of cells with diverse phenotypes, e.g., quiescent or slow cycling. Such populations have been broadly termed \"drug-tolerant persisters\" (DTPs) and may be responsible for minimal residual disease following anticancer treatment and acquired resistance. Understanding molecular mechanisms that drive emergence of DTPs could lead to new strategies to improve therapeutic outcomes. Recently, we reported that BRAF-mutant melanoma cells under prolonged BRAF inhibition enter a DTP state with balanced cell death and division, which we termed \"idling.\" Here, we apply single cell barcoding to show that idling DTP populations emerge via cell state transitions, rather than selection of a few pre-existing drug-tolerant clones. Within the time frame of our experiments, DTPs exhibit varying proportions of fast- and slow-cycling cells within each lineage, suggesting that entry into the DTP state is a stochastic process. Furthermore, single-cell transcriptomics and bulk epigenomics reveal common gene expression and ontology signatures in DTP lineages that are consistent with rebalancing of ion channels. Calcium flux experiments uncover a reduction of divalent cation reserves in intracellular organelles, likely leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress. Accordingly, idling DTPs are more prone to ferroptotic cell death, as indicated by increased sensitivity to inhibition of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which prevents removal of toxic lipid peroxides. In summary, we propose that ion channel homeostasis is a central process underlying idling DTP emergence in BRAF-mutated melanoma. Future studies will investigate translational aspects of this insight.",

While the function of cortical microcircuits has focused on neuronal elements, much less is known about the functional organization of astrocytes and their bidirectional interaction with neurons. Here we show that CB1R-mediated astrocyte activation by neuron-released endocannabinoids elevate astrocyte Ca2+ levels, stimulate ATP/adenosine release as gliotransmitters, and transiently depress synaptic transmission in layer 5 pyramidal neurons at relatively distant synapses (>20 {micro}m) from the stimulated neuron. This astrocyte-mediated heteroneuronal synaptic depression occurred between pyramidal neurons within a cortical column and was absent in neurons belonging to adjacent cortical columns. Moreover, this form of heteroneuronal synaptic depression occurs between neurons located in particular layers, following a specific connectivity pattern that depends on a layer-specific neuron-to-astrocyte signaling. These results unravel the existence of astrocyte-mediated non-synaptic communication between cortical neurons, and that this communication is column- and layer-specific, which adds further complexity to the intercellular signaling processes in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "The parEF0409 type I toxin-antitoxin locus is situated between genes for two paralogous mannitol-family phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase systems (PTS). In order to address the possibility that parEF0409 function was associated with sugar metabolism, genetic and phenotypic analyses were performed on the flanking genes. It was found that the genes were transcribed as two operons; the downstream operon essential for mannitol transport and metabolism and the upstream operon performing a regulatory function. In addition to genes for the PTS components, the upstream operon encodes a gene similar to mtlR, the key regulator of mannitol metabolism in other Gram-positive bacteria. We confirmed that this gene is essential for regulation of the downstream operon and identified putative phosphorylation sites required for carbon catabolite repression and mannitol-specific regulation. Genomic comparisons revealed that this dual operon organization of mannitol utilization genes is uncommon in enterococci and that association with a toxin-antitoxin system is unique to E. faecalis. Finally, we consider possible links between parEF0409 function and mannitol utilization.\n\nImportanceEnterococcus faecalis is both a common member of the human gut microbiota and an opportunistic pathogen. Its evolutionary success is partially due to its metabolic flexibility: in particular, its ability to import and metabolize a wide variety of sugars. While a large number of phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase sugar transport systems have been identified in the E. faecalis genome bioinformatically, the specificity and regulation of most of these systems remains undetermined. Here we characterize a complex system of two operons flanking a type I toxin-antitoxin system required for the transport and metabolism of the common dietary sugar mannitol. We also determine the phylogenetic distribution of mannitol utilization genes in the enterococcal genus and discuss the significance of association with toxin-antitoxin systems.",

    "abstract": "The arrival order of species frequently determines the outcome of their interactions. This phenomenon, called the priority effect, is ubiquitous in nature and determines local community structure, but we know surprisingly little about how it influences biodiversity across different spatial scales. Here, we use a seasonal metacommunity model to show that biodiversity patterns and the homogenizing effect of high dispersal depend on the specific mechanisms underlying priority effects. When priority effects are only driven by positive frequency dependence, dispersal-diversity relationships are sensitive to initial conditions but generally show a hump-shaped relationship: biodiversity declines when dispersal rates become high and allow the dominant competitor to exclude other species across patches. When spatiotemporal variation in phenological differences alters species interaction strengths (trait-dependent priority effects), local, regional, and temporal diversity are surprisingly insensitive to variation in dispersal, regardless of the initial numeric advantage. Thus, trait-dependent priority effects can strongly reduce the effect of dispersal on biodiversity, preventing the homogenization of metacommunities. Our results suggest an alternative mechanism that maintains local and regional diversity without environmental heterogeneity, highlighting that accounting for the mechanisms underlying priority effects is fundamental to understanding patterns of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "The minimum O2 needed to fuel the demand of aquatic animals is commonly observed to increase with temperature, driven by accelerating metabolism. However, recent measurements of critical O2 thresholds ( Pcrit) reveal more complex patterns, including those with a minimum at an inter-mediate thermal  optimum. To discern the prevalence, physiological drivers, and biogeographic manifestations of such curves, we analyze new experimental and biogeographic data using a general dynamic model of aquatic water breathers. The model simulates the transfer of oxygen from ambient water, through a boundary layer and into animal tissues driven by temperature-dependent rates of metabolism, diffusive gas exchange, and ventilatory and circulatory systems with O2-protein binding. We find that a thermal optimum in Pcrit can arise even when all physiological rates increase steadily with temperature. This occurs when O2 supply at low temperatures is limited by a process that is more temperature sensitive than metabolism, but becomes limited by a less sensitive process at warmer temperatures. Analysis of species respiratory traits suggests this scenario is not uncommon in marine biota, with ventilation and circulation limiting supply under cold conditions and diffusion limiting supply at high temperatures. Using biogeographic data, we show that species with these physiological traits inhabit lowest O2 waters near the optimal temperature for hypoxia tolerance, and are restricted to higher O2 at temperatures above and below this optimum. Our results imply that O2 tolerance can decline under both cold and warm conditions, and thus may influence both poleward and equatorward species range limits.\n\nSignificance StatementPhysiology shapes the ecology, biogeography, and climate responses of marine species. In aquatic ectotherms, accelerating metabolism and lowered oxygen availability generally result in increasing oxygen limitation with warming. Here we present evidence for thermal optima in hypoxia tolerance of diverse species that is explained by a dynamical model of organismal physiology. Our results indicate that this potentially widespread bidirectional pattern explains species biogeographic limits in cold and warm waters. It can be understood using a generalized Metabolic Index of O2 supply to demand, which captures the variable observed trends between temperature and species hypoxia sensitivity. Oxygen limitation of aerobic metabolism in cold water has far-reaching implications for marine biogeography and species migrations under climate change.",

    "abstract": "1.The fall armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) can cause tremendous yield losses in maize. Its invasion into Africa and Asia has led to an enormous influx of insecticides into maize agro-ecosystems. Safe, effective and readily available alternatives are desperately needed. Entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN) are commonly used against soil insect pests, but can also control some above-ground pests. We explored the possibility to control FAW by incorporating EPN into a formulation that can be easily applied into the whorl of maize plants, where the caterpillars mostly feed. We tested this approach in laboratory cage experiments as well as in field trials. In the laboratory, treating maize plants with a low dose of EPN in a carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) gel formulation (about 3000 infective juveniles per plant), caused 100% mortality of FAW caterpillars and prevented plant damage considerably, whereas EPN applied in water or a surfactant-polymer-formulation (SPF) caused 72% and 94% mortality, respectively. Under field conditions, one-time treatments with EPN applied in water, SPF or CMC gel were all able to prevent significant plant damage, but only the EPN-gel formulation significantly reduced FAW infestation. Notably, the gel formulation was as effective as a standard dose of cypermethrin, an insecticide commonly used against FAW. Repeated applications may be needed to reduce re-infestations by FAW across a whole cropping season depending on the local maize phenology and pest dynamics. These findings demonstrate that EPN are excellent candidates for the biological control of FAW and are a safe and sustainable alternative to chemical insecticides.\n\nHighlightsO_LIEntomopathogenic nematodes are highly lethal to fall armyworm caterpillars.\nC_LIO_LIAppropriate formulation of the nematodes is crucial for above-ground application.\nC_LIO_LIA gel formulation of entomopathogenic nematodes was as effective as chemical insecticides.\nC_LIO_LIEntomopathogenic nematodes can be used for the control of fall armyworm in maize.\nC_LI",

Here, we provide the first estimations of spontaneous chromosome duplication rates in six unicellular eukaryotic species from mutation accumulation (MA) experiments. The spontaneous chromosome duplication rates reach 1x10-4 to 1x10-3 per genome per generation, which is ~4 to ~50 times less frequent than spontaneous point mutations per genome, whereas chromosome duplication events can affect 1 to 7% of the total genome size. Comparative transcriptomics between MA lines with different chromosome duplications reveals a strong positive correlation between RNA expression rate and DNA copy number. However, comparative analyses of the translation rate of mRNAs estimated by polysome profiling unravel a chromosome specific dosage compensation mechanism. In particular, one chromosome with a gene average of 2.1 excess of mRNAs is compensated by an average of ~0.7 decrease in translation rates. Altogether, our results are consistent with previous observations of a chromosome dependent effect of dosage compensation and provide evidence that it may occur during translation. These results support the existence of a yet unknown post-transcriptional mechanism orchestrating the modification of translation of hundreds of transcripts from genes located on duplicated regions in eukaryotes.",

As manufacturing processes and development of new synthetic compounds increase to keep pace with the expanding global demand, environmental health and the effects of toxicant exposure are emerging as critical public health concerns. Owing to this, in this study, we analyzed the impact of such chemical induced toxicity in zebrafish. We first searched the literature comprehensively for genes that were modulated during neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish and then studied the interactions between those genes using induced network modules analysis of the database ConsensusPathDB. The induced network modules analysis helps to study gene interactions through various types of interactions like gene regulatory, biochemical, genetic and protein interactions. A constant communication between the heart and the brain is an important physiological phenomenon. Therefore, we also analyzed the interactions among genes that are modulated simultaneously during cardiotoxicity and neurotoxicity. This study has led us to identify some potential predictive biomarkers for neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity in zebrafish.",

    "abstract": "Pericyte-mediated capillary constriction decreases cerebral blood flow in stroke after an occluded artery is unblocked. The determinants of pericyte tone are poorly understood. We show that a small rise in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in pericytes activates chloride efflux through the Ca2+-gated anion channel TMEM16A, thus depolarizing the cell and opening voltage-gated calcium channels. This mechanism strongly amplifies the pericyte [Ca2+]i rise and capillary constriction evoked by contractile agonists and ischemia. In a rodent stroke model, TMEM16A inhibition slows the ischemia-evoked pericyte [Ca2+]i rise, capillary constriction and pericyte death, reduces neutrophil stalling and improves cerebrovascular reperfusion. Genetic analysis implicates altered TMEM16A expression in poor patient recovery from ischemic stroke. Thus, pericyte TMEM16A is a crucial regulator of cerebral capillary function, and a potential therapeutic target for stroke and possibly other disorders of impaired microvascular flow, such as Alzheimers disease and vascular dementia.",

    "abstract": "In adulthood, sleep-wake rhythms are one of the most prominent behaviors under circadian control. However, during early life, sleep is spread across the 24-hour day (1-4). The mechanism through which sleep rhythms emerge, and the consequent advantage conferred to a juvenile animal, are unknown. In 2nd instar Drosophila larvae (L2), like human infants, sleep is not under circadian control (5). Here, we identify the precise developmental timepoint when the circadian clock begins to regulate sleep in Drosophila, leading to the emergence of sleep rhythms at the early 3rd instar stage (L3). At this stage, a cellular connection forms between DN1a clock neurons and arousalpromoting Dh44 neurons, bringing arousal under clock control to drive the emergence of circadian sleep. Finally, we demonstrate that L3 but not L2 larvae exhibit long-term memory (LTM) of an aversive cue, and that this LTM depends upon deep sleep generated once sleep rhythms begin. We propose that the developmental emergence of circadian sleep enables more complex cognitive processes, including the onset of enduring memories.",

    "abstract": "Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons modulate how organisms process and respond to environmental stimuli through impacts on arousal, attention, and memory. It is unknown, however, whether basal forebrain cholinergic neurons are directly involved in conditioned behavior, independent of secondary roles in the processing of external stimuli. Using fluorescent imaging, we found that cholinergic neurons are active during behavioral responding for a reward - even in prior to reward delivery and in the absence of discrete stimuli. Photostimulation of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, or their terminals in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), selectively promoted conditioned responding (licking), but not unconditioned behavior nor innate motor outputs. In vivo electrophysiological recordings during cholinergic photostimulation revealed reward-contingency-dependent suppression of BLA neural activity, but not prefrontal cortex (PFC). Finally, ex vivo experiments demonstrated that photostimulation of cholinergic terminals suppressed BLA projection neuron activity via monosynaptic muscarinic-receptor-signaling, while also facilitating firing in GABAergic interneurons. Taken together, we show that the neural and behavioral effects of basal forebrain cholinergic activation are modulated by reward contingency in a target-specific manner.",

    "abstract": "During voluntary behaviors, animals need to disable any reflexes that could interfere with the intended movements. With the optomotor response, for example, flies stabilize a straight flight path by correcting for unintended deviations sensed as panoramic motion of the surround. HS cells of the fly are thought to mediate optomotor responses to horizontal motion. During spontaneous flight turns, an efference copy acts on HS cells with the right sign to counteract the visual input elicited by the flys own behavior. Here, we investigated HS cell activity during looming-elicited turns in flying Drosophila. We show that looming stimuli themselves can influence the processing of panoramic motion stimuli in HS cells and that in addition, an inhibitory efference copy suppresses excitatory motion responses during turns, but only in a subset of HS cells. In conclusion, our findings support the notion that processing of sensory information is finely tuned to behavioral context.",

    "abstract": "Actin filament polymerization can be branched or linear, which depends on the associated regulatory proteins. Competition for Actin monomers occurs between proteins that induce branched or linear actin polymerization. Cell specialization requires the regulation of actin filaments to allow the formation of cell-type specific structures, like cuticular hairs in Drosophila, formed by linear actin filaments. Here, we report the functional analysis of CG34401/pelado, a gene encoding a SWIM domain containing protein, conserved throughout the animal kingdom. Mutant pelado epithelial cells display actin hair elongation defects. This phenotype is reversed by increasing Actin monomer levels or by either pushing linear actin polymerization or reducing branched actin polymerization. The same behavior occurs in hemocytes, where Pelado is essential to induce filopodia, a linear actin-based structure. We further show that this function of Pelado, ZSWIM8 in mammals, is conserved in human cells, where Pelado inhibits branched actin polymerization in a cell migration context. In summary, our data indicate that the function of Pelado/ZSWIM8 in regulating actin cytoskeletal dynamics is conserved, favoring linear actin polymerization at the expense of branched filaments.",

    "abstract": "Habituation is a foundational learning process critical for animals to adapt their behavior to changes in their sensory environment. Although habituation is considered a simple form of learning, the identification of a multitude of molecular pathways including several neurotransmitter systems that regulate this process suggests an unexpected level of complexity. How the vertebrate brain integrates these various pathways to accomplish habituation learning, whether they act independently or intersect with one another, and whether they act via divergent or overlapping neural circuits has remained unclear. To address these questions, we combined pharmacogenetic pathway analysis with unbiased whole-brain activity mapping using the larval zebrafish. This approach revealed five distinct molecular and circuit modules that regulate habituation learning and identified a set of molecularly defined brain regions associated with four of the five modules. Moreover, we find that in module 1 the palmitoyltransferase Hip14 cooperates with dopamine and NMDA signaling to drive plasticity, while in module 3 the adaptor protein complex subunit Ap2s1 drives habituation by antagonizing dopamine signaling, revealing two distinct and opposing roles for dopaminergic neuromodulation in the regulation of learning. Combined, our results define a core set of distinct modules that act in concert to regulate learning-associated plasticity, and provide compelling evidence that even seemingly simple learning behaviors in a compact vertebrate brain are regulated by a complex and overlapping set of molecular and circuit mechanisms.",
