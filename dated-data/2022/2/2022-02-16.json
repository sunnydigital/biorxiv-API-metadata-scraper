    "abstract": "The immune system is stratified into layers of specialized cells with distinct functions. Recently, Lin28b was shown to serve as a master regulator of fetal lymphopoiesis, programming the development of more innate-like lymphocytes in early life. However, it remains unclear whether Lin28b specifies innate functions in more conventional adaptive lymphocytes. In this report, we discovered that Lin28b promotes the development of a more innate-like lineage of CD8+ T cells that is capable of protecting the host against a wide variety of pathogens in the absence of TCR stimulation. Using RNA-seq and ATAC-seq, we found that Lin28b transcriptionally and epigenetically programs CD8+ T cells to be highly responsive to innate cytokines. We also performed scRNAseq and found that the shift from innate-like CD8+ T cells in early life to adaptive CD8+ T cells in adulthood is mediated by changes in the abundance of distinct subsets of cells. Remarkably, the innate CD8+ T cell subset predominates in early life but is also present in adult mice and humans. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that neonatal CD8+ T cells are a distinct lineage of lymphocytes that provide the host with innate defense in early life.\n\nOne sentence SummaryHigh-dimensional analysis reveals how Lin28b programs neonatal CD8+ T cells for innate defense.",

    "abstract": "Soil dwelling microorganisms are key players in the terrestrial carbon cycle, driving both the degradation and stabilization of soil organic matter. Bacterial community structure and function vary with respect to land-use, yet the ecological drivers of this variation remain poorly described and difficult to predict. We conducted a multi-substrate DNA-stable isotope probing experiment across cropland, old-field, and forest habitats to link carbon mineralization dynamics with the dynamics of bacterial growth and carbon assimilation. We tracked the movement of 13C derived from five distinct carbon sources as it was assimilated into bacterial DNA over time. We show that carbon mineralization, community composition, and carbon assimilation dynamics all differed with respect to land-use. We also show that microbial community dynamics affect carbon assimilation dynamics and are predictable from soil DNA content. Soil DNA yield is easy to measure and it predicts microbial community dynamics linked to soil carbon cycling.\n\nOriginality-Significance StatementSoil dwelling microorganisms are key players in the terrestrial carbon cycle, driving both the degradation and stabilization of soil organic matter. Microbial communities vary with respect to land-use, but we still have an incomplete understanding of how variation in community structure links to variation in community function. DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) is a high-resolution method that can identify specific microbial taxa that assimilate carbon in situ. We conducted a large-scale multi-substrate DNA-SIP experiment to explore differences in bacterial activity across land-use regimes. We show that microbial community dynamics vary with land-use, that these dynamics are linked to soil carbon cycling, and that they are predicted from easily measured soil properties.",

    "abstract": "Detecting the presence of important parasites within a host and its environment is critical to understanding the dynamics that influence a pathogens ability to persist, while accurate detection is also essential for implementation of effective control strategies. Pseudoloma neurophilia is the most common pathogen reported in zebrafish (Danio rerio) research facilities. The only assays currently available for P. neurophilia, are through lethal sampling, often requiring euthanasia of the entire population for accurate estimates of prevalence in small populations. We present a non-lethal screening method to detect Pseudoloma neurophilia in tank water based on detection of environmental DNA (eDNA) from this microsporidum, using a previously developed qPCR assay that was adapted to the digital PCR (dPCR) platform. Using the generated dPCR data, a multi-state occupancy model was also implemented to predict the probability of detection in tank water under different flow regimes and pathogen prevalence. The occupancy model revealed that samples collected in static conditions were more informative than samples collected from flow-through conditions, with a probability of detection at 80% and 47%, respectively. There was also a positive correlation with the prevalence of infection in water and prevalence in fish based on qPCR.",

Biofilms grow at the surface of abiotic and living materials with wide-ranging mechanical properties. Despite their co-occurrence during infection, we still lack a clear understanding of how mechanics regulate biofilm architecture and the physiology of resident bacteria. The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa forms biofilms on indwelling medical device2 and on soft tissues including burn wounds and the airway mucosa3. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical properties of hydrogel material substrates define P. aeruginosa biofilm architecture. We show that hydrogel mesh size regulates twitching motility, a surface exploration mechanism priming biofilms, ultimately controlling the arrangement of single cells in the multicellular community. The resulting architectural transitions increase P. aeruginosas tolerance to colistin, a last resort antibiotic. Our results thereby establish material properties as a regulator of biofilm architecture and antibiotic efficacy.",

    "abstract": "Genomic data contribute invaluable information to the epidemiological investigation of pathogens of public health importance. However, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of bacteria typically relies on culture, which represents a major hurdle for generating such data for a wide range of species for which culture is challenging. In this study, we assessed the use of culture-free target-enrichment sequencing as a method for generating genomic data for two bacterial species: 1) Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax in both people and animals and whose culture requires high level containment facilities; and 2) Mycoplasma amphoriforme, a fastidious emerging human respiratory pathogen. We obtained high quality genomic data for both species directly from clinical samples, with sufficient coverage (>15X) for confident variant calling over at least 80% of the baited genomes for over two thirds of the samples tested. Higher qPCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (indicative of lower pathogen concentrations in the samples), pooling libraries prior to capture, and lower captured library concentration were all statistically associated with lower capture efficiency. The Ct value had the highest predictive value, explaining 52% of the variation in capture efficiency. Samples with Ct values [&le;] 30 were over 6 times more likely to achieve the threshold coverage than those with a Ct > 30. We conclude that target-enrichment sequencing provides a valuable alternative to standard WGS following bacterial culture and creates opportunities for an improved understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of many clinically important pathogens for which culture is challenging.\n\nData summaryThe authors confirm all supporting data, code and protocols have been provided within the article or through supplementary data files.

    "abstract": "Regulation of the mRNA decay activator Tristetraprolin (TTP) by the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway during the mammalian inflammatory response represents a paradigm for the regulation of mRNA turnover by signaling. Phosphorylation of TTP by p38 MAPK-activated kinase 2 (MK2) inhibits the association of TTP with the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex and represses TTP-mediated mRNA decay. Here we present evidence that TTP remains active in the presence of activated MK2 due to its highly conserved CNOT1 Interacting Motif (CIM), which remains unphosphorylated and capable of promoting deadenylation and decay. The CIM recruits the CCR4-NOT complex cooperatively with previously identified conserved tryptophan residues of TTP and deletion of the CIM strongly represses residual association with the deadenylase complex and activity of TTP in conditions of active MK2. A conserved serine in the CIM is not a target of MK2 but is instead phosphorylated by other kinases including the PKC pathway and regulates TTP activity independently of MK2. These results suggest that kinase pathways regulate TTP activity in a cooperative manner and that the p38 MAPK-MK2 pathway relies on the activation of additional kinase pathway(s) to fully control TTP function.",

    "abstract": "RNA modifications are widespread in biology, and particularly abundant in ribosomal RNA. However, the significance of these modifications is not well understood. We show that methylation of a single universally conserved nucleotide, in the catalytic center of the large subunit, gates ribosome assembly. Massively parallel mutational scanning of the essential nuclear GTPase Nog2 identified important interactions with ribosomal RNA helix 92, particularly with the methylated A-site base Gm2922. We found that 2-O-methylation of G2922 is needed for efficient nuclear export of the large subunit. Critically, we identified single amino acid changes in Nog2 that completely bypass its dependence on G2922 methylation. By solving the cryo-EM structure of the unmodified nascent subunit, we reveal how methylation flips Gm2922 into the active site channel of Nog2. This work demonstrates that a single RNA modification is a critical checkpoint in ribosome biogenesis, and suggests that RNA modifications can play an important role in regulation and assembly of macromolecular machines.",

    "abstract": "Transcriptional regulators select their targets from a large pool of similar genomic sites. The binding of the Drosophila dosage compensation complex (DCC) exclusively to the male X chromosome provides insight into binding site selectivity rules. Previous studies showed that the male-specific organizer of the complex, MSL2, and ubiquitous DNA-binding protein CLAMP directly interact and play an important role in the specificity of X chromosome binding. Here we studied the highly specific interaction between the intrinsically disordered region of MSL2 and the N-terminal zinc-finger C2H2-type (C2H2) domain of CLAMP. We obtained the NMR structure of the CLAMP N-terminal C2H2 zinc finger, which has a classic C2H2 zinc-finger fold with a rather unusual distribution of residues typically used in DNA recognition. Substitutions of residues in this C2H2 domain had the same effect on the viability of males and females, suggesting that it plays a general role in CLAMP activity. The N-terminal C2H2 domain of CLAMP is highly conserved in insects. However, the MSL2 region involved in the interaction is conserved only within the Drosophila genus, suggesting that this interaction emerged during the evolution of a mechanism for the specific recruitment of the DCC on the male X chromosome in Drosophilidae.",

    "abstract": "There is a strong consensus that selection for fungicide resistant pathogen strains can be most effectively limited by using applications of mixtures of fungicides designed to balance disease control against selection. However, how to do this in practice is not entirely characterised. Previous work indicates optimal mixtures of pairs of fungicides which are both at a high risk of resistance can be constructed using pairs of doses which select equally for both single resistant strains in the first year of application. What has not been addressed thus far is the important real-world case in which the initial levels of resistance to each fungicide differ, for example because the chemicals have been available for different lengths of time. We show how recommendations based on equal selection in the first year can be sub-optimal in this case. We introduce a simple alternative approach, based on equalising the frequencies of single resistant strains in the year that achieving acceptable levels of control is predicted to become impossible. We show that this strategy is robust to changes in parameters controlling pathogen epidemiology and fungicide efficacy. We develop our recommendation using a pre-existing, parameterised model of Zymoseptoria tritici (the pathogen causing Septoria leaf blotch on wheat), which exemplifies the range of plant pathogens which predominantly spread clonally, but for which sexual reproduction forms an important component of the life cycle. We show that pathogen sexual reproduction can influence the rate at which fungicide resistance develops, but does not qualitatively affect our optimal resistance management recommendation.",

    "abstract": "Meiotic drivers are selfish genetic elements that tinker with gametogenesis to bias their own transmission into the next generation of offspring. Such tinkering can have significant consequences on gametogenesis and end up hampering the spread of the driver. In Drosophila affinis, sex-ratio meiotic drive is caused by an X-linked complex that, when in males with a susceptible Y chromosome, results in broods that are typically more than 95% female. Interestingly, D. affinis males lacking a Y chromosome (XO) are fertile and males with the meiotic drive X and no Y produce only sons - effectively reversing the sex-ratio effect. Here, we show that meiotic drive dramatically increases the rate of nondisjunction of the Y chromosome (at least 750X), meaning that the driver is creating resistant alleles through the process of driving. We then model how the O might influence the spread, dynamics and equilibrium of the sex-ratio X chromosome. We find that the O can prevent the spread or reduce the equilibrium frequency of the sex-ratio X chromosome and it can even lead to oscillations in frequency. Finally, with reasonable parameters, the O is unlikely to lead to the loss of the Y chromosome, but we discuss how it might lead to sex-chromosome turnover indirectly.",

    "abstract": "AbstractSelective pressures on DNA sequences often result in departures from neutral evolution that can be captured by the McDonald-Kreitman (MK) test. However, the nature of such selective forces often remains unknown to experimentalists. Amino acid fixations driven by natural selection in protein coding genes are commonly associated with a genetic arms race or changing biological purposes, leading to proteins with new functionality. Here, we evaluate the expectations of a buffering mechanism driving selective amino acids to fixation, which is motivated by an observed phenotypic rescue of otherwise deleterious nonsynonymous substitutions at bag of marbles (bam) and Sex lethal (Sxl). These two important genes in Drosophila melanogaster were shown to experience strong episodic bursts of natural selection potentially due to infections of the endosymbiotic bacteria Wolbachia observed among multiple Drosophila species. Using simulations to implement and evaluate the evolutionary dynamics of a Wolbachia buffering model, we demonstrate that selectively fixed amino acid replacements will occur, but that proportion of adaptive amino acid fixations and the statistical power of the MK test to detect the departure from an equilibrium neutral model are both significantly lower than seen for an arms race/change-in-function model that favors proteins with diversified amino acids.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMapping of quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with molecular phenotypes is a powerful approach for identifying the genes and molecular mechanisms underlying human traits and diseases. How the genetic architecture of molecular traits varies across human populations, however, has been less explored. To better understand the genetics of gene regulation in East Africans, we perform expression and splicing QTL mapping in whole blood from a cohort of 162 diverse Africans from Ethiopia and Tanzania. We assess replication of these QTLs in cohorts of predominantly European ancestry and identify candidate genes under selection in human populations.\n\nResultsWe find the gene regulatory architecture of African and non-African populations is broadly shared, though there is a considerable amount of variation at individual loci across populations. Comparing our analyses to an equivalently sized cohort of European Americans, we find that QTL mapping in Africans improves the detection of expression QTLs and fine mapping of causal variation. Integrating our QTL scans with signatures of selection, we find several genes related to immunity and metabolism that are highly differentiated between Africans and non-Africans, as well as a gene associated with pigmentation, TMEM216, with evidence of population-specific selection in Nilo-Saharan speaking pastoralists.\n\nConclusionExtending QTL-mapping studies beyond groups of European ancestry, particularly to diverse indigenous populations, is vital for a complete understanding of the genetic architecture of human traits and can reveal novel functional variation underlying human traits and disease.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases have been linked to a dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control system that is partially maintained by proteins PINK1 and Parkin. Whereas mitophagy pathways are becoming well-characterized, less is known about the molecular mechanisms of PINK1 trafficking in mitochondria. Accordingly, we have used a small molecule probe (MitoBloCK-10/MB-10) that modulates the activity of TIMM44, an essential component of the protein associated motor (PAM) complex for the mitochondrial inner membrane (TIM23) translocase, to characterize PINK1 import. MB-10 did not inhibit the import or degradation of PINK1 in energized mitochondria. However, when mitophagy was induced by the addition of an uncoupler or respiratory inhibitor, MB-10 treatment altered PINK1 trafficking by inhibiting association with the TOM complex and impairing Parkin recruitment and subsequent mitophagy. MB-10 analogs that did not inhibit TIMM44 activity failed to impair mitophagy, thereby assigning specificity to MB-10. Because PINK1 undergoes lateral release from the TIM23 translocon to interact with inner membrane (IM) modulators, our studies support that TIMM44 may be a key regulator and that the PAM complex has a central role in regulating PINK1-dependent mitophagy. Our studies also provide a probe for dissecting PINK1/Parkin events for mitochondria as well as studying PINK1-dependent mitophagy in cell and animal models.",

    "abstract": "Members of the bacterial T6SS amidase effector (Tae) superfamily of toxins are delivered between competing bacteria to degrade cell wall peptidoglycan. Although Taes share a common substrate, they exhibit distinct antimicrobial potency across different competitor species. To investigate the molecular basis governing these differences, we quantitatively defined the functional determinants of Tae1 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 using a combination of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and a high-throughput in vivo genetic approach called deep mutational scanning (DMS). As expected, combined analyses confirmed the role of critical residues near the Tae1 catalytic center. Unexpectedly, DMS revealed substantial contributions to enzymatic activity from a much larger, ring-like functional hot spot extending around the entire circumference of the enzyme. Comparative DMS across distinct growth conditions highlighted how functional contribution of different surfaces is highly context-dependent, varying alongside composition of targeted cell walls. These observations suggest that Tae1 engages with the intact cell wall network through a more distributed three-dimensional interaction interface than previously appreciated, providing an explanation for observed differences in antimicrobial potency across divergent Gram-negative competitors. Further binding studies of several Tae1 variants with their cognate immunity protein demonstrate that requirements to maintain protection from Tae activity may be a significant constraint on the mutational landscape of tae1 toxicity in the wild. In total, our work reveals that Tae diversification has likely been shaped by multiple independent pressures to maintain interactions with binding partners that vary across bacterial species and conditions.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study is show that Raman spectroscopy is a sensitive tool, which can be used for analyses eggs obtained in various hens housing system. This study provided a new and simple method for hens eggs breeding systems testing. Raman methods have potential to be applied by commercial inspections in food industry for verification indications placed on eggs. The development of functional technological methods to study the quality of eggs could be an interesting way to gain profitability for the food industry, in addition to improving the general conditions of public health. A label-free Raman method for detecting spectral changes in eggs from cage systems, barn systems, free range systems and ecological systems is presented. The most important advantage of Raman spectroscopy is the ability to identify biomarkers that help estimate the quality of eggs from various hens housing systems based on spectra typical for lipids, proteins and carotenoids. We have proved that ratios 1656/1004, 1656/1444, 1444/1520 and 1656/1156 can be used as universal biomarkers to distinguish eggs from various hens housing systems. Chemometric methods have shown that eggs from ecological systems and barn systems can be distinguished based on their vibrational properties.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/480636v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b11863org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b842d1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2ac3eborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a48ad3_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "RationaleBronchoalveolar lavage of the epithelial lining fluid can sample the profound changes in the airway lumen milieu prevalent in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Characterizing the proteins in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in COPD with advanced proteomic methods will identify disease-related changes, provide insight into pathogenetic mechanisms and potential therapeutics that will aid in the discovery of more effective therapeutics for COPD.\n\nObjectivesWe compared epithelial lining fluid proteome of ex-smokers with moderate COPD who are not in exacerbation status COPD, to non-smoking healthy control subjects using advanced proteomics methods and applied proteome-scale translational bioinformatics approaches to identify potential therapeutic protein targets and drugs that modulate these proteins towards the treatment of COPD.\n\nMethodsProteomic profiles of bronchalveolar lavage fluid were obtained from 1) never-smoker control subjects with normal lung function (n=10) or 2) individuals with stable moderate (GOLD stage 2, FEV1 50% - 80% predicted) COPD who were ex-smokers for at least one year (n=10). NIHs Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) and Ingenuitys Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were the two bioinformatics tools employed for network analysis on the differentially expressed proteins to identify potential crucial hub proteins. The drug-proteome interaction signature comparison and ranking approach implemented in the Computational Analysis of Novel Drug Opportunities (CANDO) platform for multiscale therapeutic discovery was utilized to identify potential repurposable drugs for the treatment of COPD based on the BALF proteome. Subsequently, a literature-based knowledge graph was utilized to rank combinations of drugs that would most likely ameloriate inflammatory processes by inhibition or activation of their functions.\n\nResultsProteomic network analysis demonstrated that 233 of the >1800 proteins identified in the BALF were differentially expressed in COPD versus control, including proteins associated with inflammation, structural elements, and energy metabolism. Functional annotation of the differentially expressed proteins by their implicated biological processes, cellular localization, and transcription factor interactions was accomplished via DAVID. Canonical pathways containing the differential expressed proteins were detailed via the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis application. Topological network analysis demonstrated that four proteins act as central node proteins in the inflammatory pathways in COPD. The CANDO multiscale drug discovery platform was used to analyze the behavioral similarity between the interaction signatures of all FDA-approved drugs and the identified BALF proteins. The drugs with the signatures most similar interaction signatures to approved COPD drugs were extracted with the CANDO platform. The analysis revealed 189 drugs that putatively target the proteins implicated in COPD. The putative COPD drugs that were identified using CANDO were subsequently analyzed using a knowledge based technique to identify an optimal two drug combination that had the most appropriate effect on the central node proteins.\n\nConclusionAnalysis of the BALF proteome revealed novel differentially expressed proteins in the epithelial lining fluid that elucidate COPD pathogenesis. Network analyses identified critical targets that have critical roles in modulating COPD pathogenesis, for which we identified several drugs that could be repurposed to treat COPD using a multiscale shotgun drug discovery approach.",

    "abstract": "Transposons, which are DNA sequences that can move to new positions in the genome, make up a large fraction of eukaryotic genomes and occur in clusters. The insertion of transposons into the genome is hindered by compact folding of chromatin, supposedly preventing aberrant or even pathogenic insertion. Chromatin can, however, be decompacted as a consequence of transposon insertion, leading to increased accessibility and, in consequence, further insertions. While these observations suggest a positive feedback between chromatin unfolding and transposon insertion, how such a feedback might contribute to clustered transposon insertion remains poorly understood. In this study, we analyze polymer models of a self-interacting chromatin domain that unfolds as increasing numbers of transposons are inserted and block the self-interaction. On the one hand, we find that, if additional transposons are inserted adjacently to already inserted transposons, the unfolding of the chromatin domain changes from a sharp globule-coil transition to a more gradual extension of loops from a core that remains folded. On the other hand, we find that adjacent transposon insertion emerges either when transposases are excluded from densely packed chromatin, or when transposon insertion proceeds very quickly in relation to the thermal equilibration of polymer configurations. We thus derive from our model physical conditions for clustered transposon insertion and the resulting spatial compartmentalization of chromatin. An according role was recently suggested for LINE-1 and Alu repeats, which occur in clusters and drive the mesoscopic compartmentalization of the mammalian genome.\n\nSignificance StatementA large part of the genome is composed of repetitive sequences, so-called transposons. Transposons are involved in important processes, such as early embryonic development or control over which genes are used by the cell. Transposons frequently occur in clusters, where many similar sequence motifs are grouped together. Recent studies suggest that the insertion of transposons can result in local unfolding of the genome, favoring insertion of yet more transposons. Our work simulates a simplified region of the genome and transposases, which are the molecules that insert transposons into the genome. Surprisingly, large and fast-acting transposases favor the formation of distinct loops that contain most of the inserted transposons, providing a potential explanation for the clustered insertion of transposons.",

In Sonic Hedgehog (SHH)-subgroup medulloblastoma, OLIG2-expressing tumour stem cells are crucial to recurrence. We investigated the potential of the small-molecule OLIG2 inhibitor CT-179 to decrease recurrence in patient-derived organoids, mice genetically-engineered to develop SHH-driven MB, and mice with MB patient-derived xenograft (PDX) tumours. We found that OLIG2 mRNA significantly correlated with poor survival in patients with SHH-MB, but not other subgroups. CT-179 rapidly downregulated OLIG2 protein in vitro and displayed nanomolar IC50 values. CT-179 arrested MB cells at G2/M, with degradation of cyclin B1 and phospho-CDK1 inducing apoptosis. In vivo CT-179 induced similar cell cycle changes in MBs in Smo-mutant mice and significantly increased mouse survival. In both MB organoids and mouse models, CT-179 combined with radiotherapy showed greater efficacy than either treatment alone. These data highlight the potential for OLIG2-targeted therapy to improve MB outcomes by targeting recurrent disease.",

Leveraging the molecular specificity of living sensors, we genetically encoded bacteria to respond to IBD-associated molecules by luminescing. Low-power electronic readout circuits (nanowatt power) integrated into the device convert the light from just 1 L of bacterial culture into a wireless signal. We demonstrate biosensor monitoring in the GI tract of small and large animal models and integration of all components into a sub-1.4 cm3 ingestible form factor capable of supporting wireless communication.

Currently, a significant roadblock to this application is the potential for deactivating mutations in engineered genes. A recently developed method to protect engineered coding sequences from mutation is called Constraining Adaptive Mutations using Engineered Overlapping Sequences (CAMEOS). In this chapter we provide a workflow for utilising CAMEOS to create synthetic overlaps between two genes, one essential (infA) and one non-essential (aroB), to protect the non-essential gene from mutation and loss of protein function. In this workflow we detail the methods to collect large numbers of related protein sequences, produce multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), use the MSAs to generate Hidden Markov Models and Markov Random Field models, and finally generate a library of overlapping coding sequences through CAMEOS scripts. To assist practitioners with basic coding skills to try out the CAMEOS method, we have created a virtual machine containing all the required packages already installed, that can be downloaded and run locally.",

This is the first record of O. nungara from this locality and also the first record of the species for Africa. Two specimens were collected, one from Petite France (commune of Saint Paul) and one from La Plaine des Gregues (commune of Saint Joseph); the two localities are widely separated, one in the Western part and one in the South-eastern part of the island. This suggests that the species is already present in several locations in La Reunion. The sightings were communicated to us in 2021, but it is likely that the species is already present since 2020. A molecular analysis of the specimen from Petite France showed that it had the same cox1 haplotype as specimens previously recorded from several countries of Europe; it is hypothesized that the species was imported from Europe, probably from France. We mapped climatic suitability of the species in La Reunion and found that O. nungara could potentially invade a large part of the island. One record was apparently associated with the transport of plates of travertine, a construction material which has numerous cavities, suitable for the transport and survival of adult or cocoons of land flatworms.",

Based on the theory, the current study examined the interactions between interval timing and neural oscillations, as predicted by timing deficits found in neuropsychiatric conditions. The interaction is predicted to manifest in frontal-midline theta and occipital alpha oscillations, which are two important cortical oscillatory sources engaged in working memory and time perception. Therefore, the main goal of the study is to examine how depression and anxiety modulate frontal-midline theta and occipital data during the encoding of sub- and supra-second intervals. In the current study, participants reproduced sub- (400, 600, 800ms) and supra-second (1600, 1800, 2000ms) intervals while they underwent scalp EEG recordings. Anxiety and depression levels were measured via self-report psychometrics. We found that higher levels of self-reported anxiety and depression were associated with shorter reproduction of lengths of durations. Further, time-frequency analysis of scalp EEG revealed a dissociation where state anxiety altered the links between frontal-midline theta power and sub-second interval reproduction, while depression and trait anxiety altered the association between occipital alpha power and supra-second interval reproduction. Our results suggest that anxiety and depression alter time perception, and this differentially relates to frontal-midline theta and occipital alpha as substrates for sub- and supra-second interval timing.",

However, the search for malaria vaccine(s) has so far been very challenging. Multiple targets have been tested and so far only a few show promise with one having been endorsed by the WHO. In this study we explore the development of immunity in a low transmission setting, with very few documented re-infections, in order to understand the kinetics of the development and waning of immunity to current and novel blood-stage vaccine candidate antigens. To do this we performed a high-throughput measurement of natural acquired immunity against P. falciparum antigens utilizing a well-established micro-array platform based on the mammalian protein expression system. This large panel of known and novel recombinant full length ectodomain P. falciparum merozoite vaccine candidates were differently recognized by the immune system. Based on the overal spread of the data, some of these antigens induced the acquisition of high levels (1st tertile) of antibodies, among which included novel antigens such as PF3D7_1025300, PF3D7_1105800, PF3D7_1334400, PF3D7_0911300, PF3D7_1252300, PF3D7_1460600, PF3D7_1453100, PF3D7_0831400 and some induced low levels of antibodies (3rd tertile) while others induced moderate levels (4th tertile). In this longitudinal cohort with low level of malaria endemicity, acquisition of humoral immunity to these full length ectodomains P. falciparum antigens demonstrate different dynamics over-time, whereby it was either not acquired or if it was acquired it was either maintained or lost at different rates. These various identified novel antigens are potentially ideal candidates to be prioritized for further functional and or serological studies.",

    "abstract": "Australia is known for its long history of using biocontrol agents, like myxoma virus and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), to manage wild European rabbit populations. Interestingly, while undertaking RHDV surveillance of rabbits that were found dead we observed that approximately 40% of samples were negative for RHDV. To investigate whether other infectious agents are responsible for killing rabbits in Australia we subjected a subset of these RHDV-negative liver samples to metatranscriptomic sequencing. In addition, we investigated whether the host transcriptome data could provide additional differentiation between likely infectious versus non-infectious causes of death. We identified transcripts from several Clostridia species, Pasteurella multocida, Pseudomonas, and Eimeria stiedae in liver samples of several rabbits that had died suddenly, all of which are known to infect rabbits and are capable of causing fulminant disease. In addition, we identified Hepatitis E virus and Cyniclomyces yeast in some samples, both of which are not usually associated with severe disease. In one third of the sequenced liver samples, no infectious agent could be identified. While metatranscriptomic sequencing cannot provide definitive evidence of causation, additional host transcriptome analysis provided further insights to distinguish between pathogenic microbes and commensals or environmental contaminants. Interestingly, three samples where no pathogen could be identified showed evidence of upregulated host immune responses, while immune response pathways were not upregulated when E. stiedae, Pseudomonas, or yeast were detected. In summary, although no new putative rabbit pathogens were identified, this study provides a robust workflow for future investigations into rabbit mortality events.\n\nImportanceWe have observed that approximately 40% of rabbit liver samples submitted for RHDV testing (from rabbits that had died suddenly without obvious cause) are RHDV-negative. Interestingly, a similar finding was reported in pet rabbits in the United Kingdom. This raises the intriguing question of what else is killing rabbits, both in Australia and internationally? Using a metatranscriptomic sequencing approach, we found that Clostridiaceae, Pasteurella multocida, and Eimeria are frequently detected in cases of sudden rabbit death in Australia. While we did not identify any potential new pathogens that could be explored in the context of wild rabbit management, we have validated an approach to explore future mortality events of lagomorphs that may identify candidate novel biocontrols. Furthermore, our findings reaffirm the recommendation to follow good hygiene practices when handling rabbits, since domestic rabbits harboured several pathogens of potential public health significance, including Escherichia, Pasteurella multocida, and Hepatitis E virus.",

    "abstract": "X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a dosage compensation phenomenon that occurs in females. Initiation of XCI depends on Xist RNA, which triggers silencing of one of the two X chromosomes, except for genes that escape XCI. This inactive state is propagated during cell divisions with continuous Xist expression. How Xist impacts XCI maintenance remains an open question. Here, we delete Xist in hematopoietic cells of mice and report increased fraction of cycling hematopoietic progenitors and differentiation defects during hematopoiesis. Xist loss results in upregulation of a subset of X-linked genes, several of which escape XCI and have functions in hematopoiesis and immunity. We find that the underlying mechanism of transcriptional upregulation involves reduced H3K27me3 occupancy and increased chromatin accessibility which accommodate binding of YY1 transcription factor (TF). We propose that XCI maintenance defects in Xist deficient mice rely on the landscape of open chromatin sites, TF availability, and cell cycle stress in specific cellular context during hematopoiesis.",

    "abstract": "West Nile disease is a vector-borne disease caused by West Nile virus (WNV), involving mosquitoes as vectors and birds as maintenance hosts. Humans and other mammals can be infected via mosquito bites, developing symptoms ranging from mild fever to severe neurological infection. Due to the worldwide spread of WNV, human infection risk is high in several countries. Nevertheless, there are still several knowledge gaps regarding WNV dynamics. Several aspects of transmission taking place between birds and mosquitoes, such as the length of the infectious period in birds or mosquito biting rates, are still not fully understood, and precise quantitative estimates are still lacking for the European species involved. This lack of knowledge affects the precision of parameter values when modelling the infection, consequently resulting in a potential impairment of the reliability of model simulations and predictions. Further investigations are thus needed to better understand these aspects, but field studies, especially those involving several wild species, such as in the case of WNV, can be challenging. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify which mechanisms most influence the dynamics of WNV transmission. In the present work, we propose a sensitivity analysis to identify the parameters that have the largest impact on the spread of the infection. Based on a mathematical model simulating WNV spread into the Lombardy region (northern Italy), the basic reproduction number of the infection was estimated and used to quantify infection spread into mosquitoes and birds. Then, we quantified how variations in the duration of the infectious period in birds, the mosquito biting rate on birds, and the competence and susceptibility to infection of different bird species might affect WNV transmission. Our study highlights that all considered parameters can affect the spread of WNV, but the duration of the infectious period in birds and mosquito biting rate are the most impactful, highlighting the need for further studies to better estimate these parameters. In addition, our study suggests that a WNV outbreak is very likely to occur in all areas with suitable temperatures, highlighting the wide area where WNV represents a serious risk for public health.\n\nAuthor SummaryInfectious communicable diseases are currently one of the main burdens for human beings and public health. The comprehension of their spread and maintenance is one of the main goals to facilitate their control and eradication, but due to the complexity of their cycles and transmission mechanisms, obtaining this information is often difficult and demanding. The control of vector-borne diseases in particular represents an important and very complex challenge for public health. Mathematical models are suitable tools to investigate disease dynamics and their transmission mechanisms. To build a suitable model that can simulate transmission dynamics, a reliable and precise estimate of parameters for measuring transmission mechanisms is fundamental. We thus propose a sensitivity analysis of four unknown epidemiological parameters (bird recovery rate, mosquito biting rate, avian susceptibility to infection and avian competence to infection) that play a crucial role in driving West Nile virus (WNV) infection to determine which of them have the greatest impact on infection spread. This analysis allows us to identify the investigated parameters that need the most accurate estimate and to further investigate mechanisms that majorly affect WNV spread.",

    "abstract": "In recent years the availability of genome sequence information has grown logarithmically resulting in the identification of a plethora of uncharacterised genes. To address this gap in functional annotation, many high-throughput screens have been devised with the goal of uncovering novel gene functions. Gene-replacement libraries are one such tool that can be screened in a high-throughput way to link genotype and phenotype and are key community resources. However, for a phenotype to be attributed to a specific gene, there needs to be confidence in the genotype. Construction of large libraries can be laborious and occasionally errors will arise. Here, we present a rapid and accurate method for the validation of any ordered gene-replacement library. We applied our method (TraDIS-Validate) to the well-known Keio library of Escherichia coli gene-deletion mutants. Our method identified 3,718 constructed mutants out of a total of 3,728 confirmed isolates. TraDIS-validate therefore had a success rate of 99.7% for identifying the correct kanamycin cassette position. This dataset provides a benchmark for the purity of the Keio mutants and a screening method for mapping the position of an antibiotic resistance cassette in any ordered library.",

    "abstract": "Increasing antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella has been observed in the Philippines. This study aims to utilize whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize the population and AMR mechanisms of Salmonella captured by the Philippine Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Program (ARSP) and contrast to traditional laboratory methods.\n\nWe sequenced the whole genomes of 148 Salmonella Typhi (S. Typhi) and 65 non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) collected in the Philippines in 2013-2014. From the genome sequences, we determined the serotype, multilocus sequence type, presence of determinants of antimicrobial resistance and relatedness between isolates. We also compared the genotypic predictions of serotype and AMR to the phenotypic data.\n\nAMR rates in S. Typhi were low, with sparse acquisition of mutations associated with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones or extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) genes. In contrast, three quarters of NTS isolates were insusceptible to at least one antimicrobial, with more than half carrying mutations and/or genes linked to resistance to fluoroquinolones. ESBL genes were detected in five genomes that also carried other AMR determinants. The population of S. Typhi was dominated by the likely endemic genotype 3.0, which also caused of a putative local outbreak susceptible to antibiotics. The main NTS clades were global epidemic S. Enteritidis ST11 and the monophasic variant of S. Typhimurium (I 4,[5],12:i:-) ST34, which had frequently been serotyped as S. Typhimurium in the laboratory.\n\nThis was the first time that Salmonella isolated from the Philippines were characterized by WGS and we provide evidence of its utility for ongoing surveillance at the ARSP.",

    "abstract": "SWI/SNF has been shown to have important functions in hypoxia-mediated gene expression through roles of its catalytic and core subunits. Since SWI/SNF exists as three distinct assemblies, and usage of complex specific subunits of the complex can be expected to vary within a given cell under changing environmental conditions. It remains an open question as to the compositional makeup of SWI/SNF and the roles of individual complexes in gene expression and cell viability in a hypoxic environment. In our current study, we find that hypoxia regulates levels of unique subunits that define each complex. Protein levels of ARID2 and PBRM1, members of PBAF and BRD9, a member of ncBAF, are downregulated in hypoxic cells, while members of BAF complex are retained. Our studies further show that loss of ARID1A, ARID1B and DPF2, which are unique subunits of BAF, reduces induction of HIF target genes and ARID1A or DPF2 are important for cell survival during hypoxia. Collectively, our results provide evidence that levels of SWI/SNF forms are not static within cells, but can be dynamically altered as a response to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionGlottic insufficiency can result from neurologic injury, surgery, radiation, and the aging larynx. Treatment includes voice therapy, vocal fold injection augmentation, surgical medialization, or laryngeal reinnervation procedures. The objective of this study is to describe an in-vivo rabbit phonation model for glottic insufficiency that is simple and reproducible by means of unilateral cricothyroid muscle stimulation and high-speed video recordings of evoked phonation.\n\nMethodsA non-randomized controlled trial utilizing seven New Zealand white rabbits was performed via a single operation including evoked phonation with bilateral and unilateral cricothyroid muscle stimulation conditions. The effect of stimulation method on glottic cycle, pitch and loudness was compared. Endoscopic recordings using 5,000 frames-per-second image capture technology and audiologic recordings were obtained for all phonation conditions. Primary outcome measures included means of maximum glottal area (MGA)/length pixel ratio, right and left amplitude/length pixel ratios, calculated cycle frequency, auditory recorded frequency, and maximum auditory intensity. Measurements were obtained via pixel counts using imageJ. Paired t-tests compared the average values obtained over five consecutive glottic cycles for each unilateral and bilateral stimulation during evoked phonation.\n\nResultsMean (median, IQR) MGA/length was significantly greater with unilateral, 20.30 (19.13, 10.97), vs bilateral, 9.62 (8.33, 2.58), stimulation (p=0.043). Mean frequency (median, IQR), 683.46 Hz (658.5, 197.1) vs 479.92 Hz (458.1, 112); (p=0.027) and mean maximum intensity, 83.5 dB (83.5, 1) vs 76.3 dB (74.5, 4); (p=0.013) were significantly reduced from bilateral to unilateral stimulation. There was no significant difference of mean right amplitude/length between bilateral and unilateral.\n\nConclusionThe described model demonstrates a simple and reproducible means of producing glottic insufficiency and represents a pathway for better understanding the biomechanics and pathophysiology of glottic insufficiency and offers the potential to compare treatment modalities through in-vivo study.",

Therefore, activation of ERR could be a potential therapeutic intervention for heart failure. However, no natural or synthetic ERR agonist is available to demonstrate their pharmacological effect in vivo. Using a structure-based design approach, we designed and synthesized two structurally distinct pan-ERR agonists, SLU-PP-332 (332) and SLU-PP-915 (915), which significantly improved ejection fraction and ameliorated fibrosis against pressure overload-induced heart failure without affecting cardiac hypertrophy. Mechanistically, a broad-spectrum of metabolic genes were transcriptionally activated by ERR agonists, particularly genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and mitochondrial function, which were mainly mediated by ERR{gamma}. Metabolomics analysis showed significant normalization of metabolic profiles in fatty acid/lipid and TCA/OXPHOS metabolites by 915 in the mouse heart with 6-week pressure overload. Autophagy was also induced by ERR agonists in cardiomycoyte. On the other hand, ERR agonism led to downregulation of cell cycle and development pathways, which was partially mediated by E2F1 in cardiomyocyte. In summary, ERR agonists maintain oxidative metabolism, which confers cardiac protection against pressure overload-induced heart failure in vivo. Our results provided direct pharmacological evidence supporting the further development of ERR agonists as novel heart failure therapeutics in vivo.",

Here we studied the immunometabolic mechanisms for the spatial immune specialization and the dysregulated immune response during ulcerative colitis at single-cell resolution.

Also, IgA+ plasma cells accumulated in lamina propria of the sigmoid colon were identified to be more metabolically activated versus those in the cecum and transverse colon, and the improved metabolic activity was correlated with the expression of CD27. In addition to the immunometabolic reprogramming caused by spatial localization colon, we found dysregulated cellular metabolism was related to the impaired immune functions of macrophages, dendritic cells, regulatory T cells, and ILCs in patients with ulcerative colitis. The cluster of OSM+ inflammatory monocytes was also identified to play its role in resistance to anti-TNF treatment, and we explored targeted metabolic reactions that could reprogram them to a normal state. Altogether, this study revealed a landscape of metabolic reprogramming of human colonic immune cells in different locations and disease states, and offered new insights into treating ulcerative colitis by immunometabolic modulation.",

We describe a simple add-on method to investigate 5-methylcytosine residues in the bacterial 16S rDNA region from clinical samples or flora. Single-stranded bacterial DNA after bisulfite conversion was preferentially amplified with multiple displacement amplification (MDA) at pH neutral, and the 16S rDNA region was analyzed using nested bisulfite PCR and sequencing. 16S rDNA bisulfite sequencing can provide clinically important bacterial DNA methylation status concurrently with intact 16S rDNA sequence information. We used this approach to identify novel methylation sites and a methyltransferase (M. MmnI) in Morganella morganii. Next, we analyzed bacterial flora from clinical specimens of small amount and identified different methylation motifs among Enterococcus faecalis strains. The method developed here, referred to as \"add-on\" to the conventional 16S rDNA analysis, is the most clinically used bacterial identification genetic test, which provides additional information that could not be obtained with the conventional method. Since the relationship between drug resistance in bacteria and DNA methylation status has been reported, bacterial epigenetic information would be useful in clinical testing as well. Our analysis suggests that M. MmnI has a promotive effect on erythromycin resistance. 16S rDNA bisulfite PCR and sequencing coupled with MDA at pH neutral is a useful add-on tool for analyzing 16S meta-epigenetics.",

    "abstract": "Interlineage communication within a cancer microenvironment can augment cancer cell behaviour and impact response to therapy. Patient-derived cancer organoids provide an opportunity to explore cancer cell biology, however it is a major challenge to generate a complex cancer microenvironment in vitro. Here, we established a stromal tumoroid culture system modeling pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) that reconstitutes multilineage interactions between cancer, endothelial, and fibroblast cells and recapitulates several aspects of primary tumors. Whole-mount immunohistochemistry on cleared tumoroids reveals organized vessel, desmoplastic fibroblast, and glandular cancer cell phenotypes that emerge over time. Time-course scRNA-seq measurements show that tumoroid formation activates fibroblasts, altering the extracellular matrix (ECM) composition and inducing cancer cell signal-response signatures and metabolic state change. Comparison between tumoroids with normal or cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs) reveals different ECM compositions, as well as differential effects on cancer cell behaviors and metabolism. We identify Syndecan 1 (SDC1) and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) as receptor and metabolic nodes involved in cancer cell response to CAF signals, and blocking SDC1 disrupts cancer cell growth within the tumoroid. Tumoroids from multiple PDAC patients revealed co-existence of subpopulations associated with classical and basal phenotypes, and CAF-induced migration behaviors emerged in certain patient tumoroids. Comparisons between patient tumoroids revealed a multigene migration signature that develops over time reflecting a stress response mechanism that correlates with worse clinical outcome. Altogether, stromal tumoroids can be used to explore dynamic and reciprocal interactions between cancer, CAF and endothelial cell states, and our data provides new inroads into the discovery of personalized pancreatic cancer therapies.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major health issue, the outcome of which depends primarily on damage and reparative processes of tubular epithelial cells (TEC). Mechanisms underlying AKI remain incompletely understood, specific therapies are lacking and monitoring the course of AKI in clinical routine is confined to measuring urine output and plasma levels of filtration markers.\n\nHere we demonstrate feasibility and potential of a novel approach to assess the cellular and molecular dynamics of AKI by establishing a robust urine-to-single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) pipeline for excreted kidney cells via flow cytometry sorting. We analyzed 42,608 single cell transcriptomes of 40 urine samples from 32 AKI patients and compared our data with reference material from human AKI post-mortem biopsies and published mouse data. We demonstrate that TEC transcriptomes mirror intrarenal pathology and reflect distinct injury and repair processes, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and tissue rearrangement. We also describe an AKI-specific abundant urinary excretion of progenitor-like cells.\n\nIn conclusion, single cell transcriptomics of kidney cells excreted in urine provides non-invasive, unprecedented insight into cellular processes underlying AKI, thereby opening novel opportunities for target identification, AKI sub-categorization and monitoring of natural disease course and interventions.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=130 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/479234v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e7175corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aed1e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5655f4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2512a7_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Researchers would generally adjust for the possible confounding effect of population structure by considering global ancestry proportions or top principle components. Alternatively, researchers would conduct admixture mapping to increase the power to detect variants with an ancestry effect. This is sufficient in simple admixture scenarios, however, populations from southern Africa can be complex multi-way admixed populations. Duan et al. (2018) first described local ancestry adjusted allelic (LAAA) analysis as a robust method for discovering association signals, while producing minimal false-positives. Their simulation study, however, was limited to a two-way admixed population. Realizing that their findings might not translate to other admixture scenarios, we simulated a three- and five-way admixed population to compare the LAAA model to other models commonly used in GWAS. We found that, given our admixture scenarios, the LAAA model identifies the most causal variants in most of the phenotypes we tested across both the three-way and five-way admixed populations. The LAAA model also produced a high number of false-positives which was potentially caused by the ancestry effect size that we assumed. Considering the extent to which the various models tested differed in their results and considering that the source of a given association is unknown, we recommend that researchers use multiple GWAS models when analysing populations with complex ancestry.",

    "abstract": "Solution NMR spectroscopy is a well-established tool with unique advantages for structural studies of RNA molecules. However, for large RNA sequences, the NMR resonances often overlap severely. A reliable way to perform resonance assignment and allow further analysis despite spectral crowding is the use of site-specific isotope labeling in sample preparation. While solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis has several advantages, RNA length and availability of isotope-labeled building blocks are persistent issues. Purely enzymatic methods pose as an alternative and have been presented in the literature. In this study, we report on a method in which we exploit the preference of T7 RNA polymerase for nucleotide monophosphates over triphosphates for the 5 position, which allows 5-labeling of RNA. Successive ligation to an unlabeled RNA strand generates a site-specifically labeled RNA. We show the successful production of such an RNA sample for NMR studies, report on experimental details and expected yields, and present the surprising finding of a previously hidden set of peaks which reveals conformational exchange in the RNA structure. This study highlights the feasibility of site-specific isotope-labeling of RNA with enzymatic methods.",

    "abstract": "Global changes may direct species expansion away from their current range. When such an expansion occurs, and a species colonizes a new region, it is important to monitor the habitat used by the species and use the information for updated management strategies. Water deer is listed as Vulnerable species in IUCN Red List and restricted to east central China and the Korean Peninsula. Since 2017 water deer has expanded its range towards northeast China and the Russian Far East. Our research focuses on data collected in northeast China and the Russian Far East during 2017-2021, with the purpose of providing support for a better understanding of habitat use and provide conservation suggestions. We used MaxEnt to model species niche and distribution and predict habitat suitability for water deer and applied the circuitscape to determine possible dispersal routes for the species. There is good quality habitat for water deer in the boundary area of the Yalu and Tumen River estuaries between China, North Korea, and the Russian Far East, as well as the east and west regions of the Korean Peninsula. Elevation, distance to cropland and water sources, and presence of wetlands were the variables that positively contributed to modelling the suitable habitats. Two possible dispersal routes were determined using the circuit theory, one was across the area from North Korea to the downstream Tumen transboundary region, and the other was across North Korea to the boundary region in China and along the tiger national park in northern China. A series of protected areas in North Korea, China, and Russia may support the dispersal of water deer. The establishment of a Northeast Asia landscape conservation network would help establish monitoring and conservation planning at a broad scale, and this study provides an example for the need for such a network",
