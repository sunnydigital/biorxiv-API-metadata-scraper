    "abstract": "The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) is an important source of disease-causing genetic variability, but existing sequencing methods limit understanding, precluding phased measurement of mutations and clear detection of large sporadic deletions. We adapted a method for amplification-free sequence enrichment using Cas9 cleavage to obtain full length nanopore reads of mtDNA. We then utilized the long reads to phase mutations in a patient with an mtDNA-linked syndrome and demonstrated that this method can map age-induced mtDNA deletions. We believe this method will offer deeper insight into our understanding of mtDNA variation.",

    "abstract": "This article describes dynamical simulations of the assembly of an icosahedral protein shell around a bicomponent fluid cargo. Our simulations are motivated by bacterial microcompartments, which are protein shells found in bacteria that assemble around a complex of enzymes and other components involved in certain metabolic processes. The simulations demonstrate that the relative interaction strengths among the different cargo species play a key role in determining the amount of each species that is encapsulated, their spatial organization, and the nature of the shell assembly pathways. However, the shell protein-shell protein and shell protein-cargo component interactions that help drive assembly and encapsulation also influence cargo composition within certain parameter regimes. These behaviors are governed by a combination of thermodynamic and kinetic effects. In addition to elucidating how natural microcompartments encapsulate multiple components involved within reaction cascades, these results have implications for efforts in synthetic biology to colocalize alternative sets of molecules within microcompartments to accelerate specific reactions. More broadly, the results suggest that coupling between self-assembly and multicomponent liquid-liquid phase separation may play a role in the organization of the cellular cytoplasm.",

In this study, a fragment derived from aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional protein1 (AIMP1) was secreted from HFSCs to activate DPCs to maintain hair follicle homeostasis. A histological analysis revealed that AIMP1 levels in hair follicles decreased with hair loss. Hair regrowth in AIMP1-induced mice was faster than that in non-induced mice. Deletion mapping revealed 41 amino acids (TN41, aa 6-46) as the active region of AIMP1. The N-terminal peptide fragment of AIMP1 generated by MMP1 was secreted from Wnt-treated HFSCs to activate DPCs via FGFR2. TN41 activated Akt and ERK, increased {beta}-catenin, and enhanced DPCs activation. TN41 also promoted hair shaft elongation in cultured human hair follicles and improved the hair-inducing activity of cultured DPC spheroids. In summation, the AIMP1 fragment secreted from HFSCs appears to stimulate active hair regrowth through activating DPCs.",

    "abstract": "The elucidation of the properties of malignant glioma and development of therapeutic methods require model cells with characteristics such as invasiveness, multinuclearity, and ability for mitosis. A previous study has shown that overexpression of active HRas (HRasL61) in neural stem/progenitor cells isolated from fetal telencephalic neuroepithelial cells with homozygous deletion of the p53 locus forms glioma-initiating cells (GICs). The orthotopically transplantation of 10 cells into the forebrain of immunodeficient mice, resulted in the development of glioblastoma multiforme-like malignant brain tumors. In this study, GICs were induced from wild-type fetal neural stem/progenitor cells. Through forced expression of CRISPR-associated protein 9 together with a guide RNA that recognizes the p53 gene, neural stem/progenitor cells containing p53 knockout cells were obtained. Furthermore, HRasL61 was forced-expressed and transplanted into the immunodeficient mice. These cells were tumor-initiating cells (TICs) with tumorigenicity in the brain. However, no invasiveness to the brain was observed. The p53 homozygous-deleted cells obtained through single-cell cloning from TICs were GICs, forming glioblastoma multiforme-like tumors. The induced GICs strongly expressed the GIC marker. These results indicate that GICs can be induced through genetic recombination using genome editing. This study suggests that the use of genome editing may lead to the elucidation of the oncogenic mechanisms of human cells that cannot delete genes.",

Five untreated age-matched juvenile marmoset retinas were used as controls (Rx: -0.74{+/-}0.4D).\n\nResultsAs control marmoset eyes grew normally, there was an age-related increase in astrocyte numbers associated with RNFL thickening. Marmosets with induced myopia did not show this trend and, on the contrary, had reduced astrocyte numbers, increased positive GFAP immunopositive staining, thinner RNFL, lower peripheral capillary branching, and increased numbers of string vessels.\n\nConclusionThe myopic changes in retinal astrocytes, vasculature, and ganglion cell layer thickness suggest a reorganization of the astrocyte and vascular templates during myopia development and progression. Whether these adaptations are beneficial or harmful to the retina remains to be investigated.\n\nSummary StatementThis article provides new information on how progressive myopia affects key elements of the retinal neurovascular unit.",

Marker analysis is also used as a tool to investigate organ functioning and disease progression. As these processes happen in three dimensions, the development of technologies that enable detection of gene expression in the whole organ or embryo is essential. Here, we describe an optimized protocol of whole mount multiplexed RNA in situ hybridization chain reaction version 3.0 (HCR v3.0) in combination with immunohistochemistry (IHC), followed by fructose-glycerol clearing and light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) imaging on whole-mount Octopus vulgaris embryos. We developed a code to automate probe design which can be applied for designing HCR v3.0 type probe pairs for fluorescent in situ mRNA visualization. As proof of concept, neuronal (Ov-elav) and glial (Ov-apolpp) markers were used for multiplexed HCR v3.0. Neural progenitor (Ov-ascl1) and precursor (Ov-neuroD) markers were combined with an immunostaining for phosphorylated-histone H3, a marker for mitosis. After comparing several tissue clearing methods, fructose-glycerol clearing was found optimal in preserving the fluorescent signal of HCR v3.0. The expression that was observed in whole-mount octopus embryos matched with the previous expression data gathered from paraffin-embedded transverse sections. Three-dimensional reconstruction revealed additional spatial organization that had not been discovered using two-dimensional methods.",

    "abstract": "Adult interfollicular epidermis (IFE) renewal is likely orchestrated by physiological demands of its complex tissue architecture comprising spatial and cellular heterogeneity. Mouse tail and back skin display two kinds of basal IFE spatial domains that regenerate at different rates. Here we elucidate the molecular and cellular states of basal IFE domains by marker expression and single cell transcriptomics in mouse and human skin. We uncover two paths of basal cell differentiation that reflect in part the IFE spatial domain organization. We unravel previously unrecognized similarities between mouse tail IFE basal domains defined as scales and interscales versus human rete ridges and inter-ridges, respectively. Second, our basal IFE transcriptomics and gene targeting in mice provide evidence supporting a physiological role of IFE domains: adaptation to differential UV exposure. We identify Sox6 as a novel UV-induced and interscale/inter-ridge basal IFE-domain transcription factor, important for IFE proliferation and survival. The spatial, cellular, and molecular organization of IFE basal domains underscores skin adaptation to environmental exposure and its unusual robustness in adult homeostasis.\n\nSynopsis\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=112 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481662v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1565ee8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@170f3e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9b67adorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b3ba40_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Maintenance of cardiomyocyte identity is vital for normal heart development and function. However, our understanding of cardiomyocyte plasticity remains incomplete. Here, we show that sustained expression of the zebrafish transcription factor (TF) Nr2f1a prevents the progressive acquisition of ventricular cardiomyocyte (VC) and pacemaker cardiomyocyte (PC) identities within distinct regions of the atrium. Transcriptomic analysis of isolated atrial cardiomyocytes (ACs) from nr2f1a mutant zebrafish embryos showed increased VC marker gene expression and altered expression of core PC regulatory genes, including decreased expression of nkx2.5, a critical repressor of PC differentiation. At the arterial pole of the atrium in nr2f1a mutants, cardiomyocytes resolve to VC identity within the expanded atrioventricular canal. However, at the venous pole, there is a progressive wave of AC transdifferentiation into PCs across the atrium toward the arterial pole. Restoring Nkx2.5 is sufficient to repress PC identity in nr2f1a mutant atria and analysis of chromatin accessibility identified a Nr2f1a-dependent nkx2.5 enhancer expressed in the atrial myocardium directly adjacent to PCs, supporting that Nr2f1a limits PC differentiation within venous ACs via maintaining nkx2.5 expression. The Nr2f-dependent maintenance of AC identity within discrete atrial compartments may provide insights into the molecular etiology of concurrent structural congenital heart defects and associated arrhythmias.",

    "abstract": "The generation of complex structures during embryogenesis requires the controlled migration and differentiation of cells from distant origins. How migration and differentiation are coordinated and impact each other to form functional structures is not fully understood. Neural crest cells migrate extensively giving rise to many cell types. In the trunk, neural crest migrate collectively forming chains comprised of cells with distinct migratory identities: one leader cell at the front of the group directs migration, while followers track the leader forming the body of the chain. Herein we analysed the relationship between trunk neural crest migratory identity and terminal differentiation. We found that trunk neural crest migration and fate allocation is coherent. Leader cells that initiate movement give rise to the most distal derivativities. Interestingly, the asymmetric division of leaders separates migratory identity and fate. The distal daughter cell retains the leader identity and clonally forms the Sympathetic Ganglia. The proximal sibling migrates as a follower and gives rise to Schwann cells. The sympathetic neuron transcription factor phox2bb is strongly expressed by leaders from early stages of migration, suggesting that specification and migration occur concomitantly and in coordination. Followers divide symmetrically and their fate correlates with their position in the chain.",

In the present study, we explored fetal brain pathologies at term gestation resulting from ZIKV infection during either first or second trimester in the Olive baboon. In all dams, viremia resolved after 7 days post infection (dpi). One first trimester infected dam aborted at 5 dpi. All dams developed IgM and IgG response to ZIKV with ZIKV IgG detected in fetal serum. Substantial placental pathology and inflammation was observed including disruption of syncytiotrophoblast layers, delayed villous maturation, partially or fully thrombosed vessels, calcium mineralization and fibrin deposits. In the uterus, ZIKV was detected in [3/4] first trimester but not in second trimester infected dams. While ZIKV was not detected in any fetal tissue at term, all fetuses exhibited varying degrees of neuropathology. Fetal brains from ZIKV infected dams exhibited a range of gross brain pathologies including irregularities of the major gyri and sulci of the cerebral cortex and cerebellar pathology. Frontal cortices of ZIKV fetuses showed a general disorganization of the six-layered cortex with degree of disorganization varying among the fetuses from the two groups. Frontal cortices from first but not second trimester infections exhibited increased microglia and astrocyte numbers (white matter) in both trimester infections. In the cerebellum, increased microglia were observed in both first and second trimester infected fetuses and decreased oligodendrocyte precursor cell populations in the cerebellar white matter in first trimester infections.

However, its practical application was rather limited due to low natural abundance and inefficient cell factories for biosynthesis. Here we report the metabolic engineering of oleaginous yeast Rhodotorula toruloides for TAL overproduction. We first introduced a 2-pyrone synthase gene from Gerbera hybrida (GhPS) into R. toruloides and investigated the effects of different carbon sources on TAL production. We then systematically employed a variety of metabolic engineering strategies to increase the flux of acetyl-CoA by enhancing its biosynthetic pathways and disrupting its competing pathways. We found that overexpression of citrate lyase (ACL1) improved TAL production by 45% compared to the GhPS overexpressing strain, and additional overexpression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC1) further increased TAL production by 29%. Finally, we characterized the resulting strain I12-ACL1-ACC1 using fed-batch bioreactor fermentation in glucose or oilcane juice medium with acetate supplementation and achieved a titer of 28 g/L or 23 g/L TAL, respectively.

    "abstract": "The ability of cells to mount an interferon response to virus infections depends on intracellular nucleic acid sensing pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). RIG-I is an intracellular PRR that binds short double stranded viral RNAs to trigger MAVS-dependent signalling. The RIG-I/MAVS signalling complex requires the coordinated activity of multiple kinases and E3 ubiquitin ligases to activate the transcription factors that drive type I and type III interferon production from infected cells. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) regulates the activity of multiple receptor signalling pathways in both ligase-dependent and -independent ways. Here, we show that the three proteins that constitute LUBAC have separate functions in regulating RIG-I signalling. Both HOIP, the E3 ligase capable of generating M1-ubiquitin chains, and LUBAC accessory protein HOIL-1 are required for viral RNA sensing by RIG-I. The third LUBAC component, SHARPIN, is not required for RIG-I signalling. These data cement the role of LUBAC as a positive regulator of RIG-I signalling and as an important component of antiviral innate immune responses.",

    "abstract": "We apply our mechanistic, within-host, pre-immunity, respiratory tract infection model for unvaccinated, previously uninfected, and immune-compromised individuals. Starting from published cell infection and viral replication data for the SARS-CoV-2 alpha variant, we explore variability in outcomes of viral load and cell infection due to three plausible mechanisms altered by SARS-CoV-2 mutations of delta and omicron. We seek a mechanistic explanation of clinical test results: delta nasal infections express [~]3 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load than alpha, while omicron infections express an additional 1 to 2 orders-of-magnitude rise over delta. Model simulations reveal shortening of the eclipse phase (the time between cellular uptake of the virus and onset of infectious viral replication and shedding) alone can generate 3-5 orders-of-magnitude higher viral load within 2 days post initial infection. Higher viral replication rates by an infected cell can generate at most one order-of-magnitude rise in viral load, whereas higher cell infectability has minimal impact and lowers the viral load.",

    "abstract": "T cells play a critical role in the adaptive immune response, recognizing peptide antigens presented on the cell surface by Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) proteins. While assessing peptides for MHC binding is an important component of probing these interactions, traditional assays for testing peptides of interest for MHC binding are limited in throughput. Here we present a yeast display-based platform for assessing the binding of tens of thousands of user-defined peptides in a high throughput manner. We apply this approach to assess a tiled library covering the SARS-CoV-2 proteome and four dengue virus serotypes for binding to human class II MHCs, including HLA-DR401, -DR402, and -DR404. This approach identifies binders missed by computational prediction, highlighting the potential for systemic computational errors given even state-of-the-art training data, and underlines design considerations for epitope identification experiments. This platform serves as a framework for examining relationships between viral conservation and MHC binding, and can be used to identify potentially high-interest peptide binders from viral proteins. These results demonstrate the utility of this approach for determining high-confidence peptide-MHC binding.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is in continuous interaction with the intestinal mucosa via metabolic, neuro- immunological, and neuroendocrine pathways. Disruption in levels of antimicrobial peptides produced by the enteroendocrine cells, such as catestatin, has been associated with changes in the gut microbiota and imbalance in intestinal homeostasis. However, whether the changes in the gut microbiota have a causational role in intestinal dyshomeostasis has remained elusive. To this end, we performed reciprocal fecal microbial transplantation in wild-type mice and mice with a knockout in the catestatin coding region of the chromogranin-A gene (CST-KO mice). Combined microbiota phylogenetic profiling, RNA sequencing, and transmission electron microscopy were employed. Fecal microbiota transplantation from mice deficient in catestatin (CST-KO) to microbiota-depleted wild-type mice induced transcriptional and physiological features characteristic of a distorted colon in the recipient animals, including impairment in tight junctions, as well as an increased collagen area fraction indicating colonic fibrosis. In contrast, fecal microbiota transplantation from wild-type mice to microbiota-depleted CST-KO mice reduced collagen fibrotic area, restored disrupted tight junction morphology, and altered fatty acid metabolism in recipient CST-KO mice. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the murine metabolic- and immune-related cellular pathways and processes that are co-mediated by the fecal microbiota transplantation and supports a prominent role for the gut microbiota in the colonic distortion associated with the lack of catestatin in mice. Overall, the data show that the gut microbiota may play a causal role in the development of features of intestinal inflammation and metabolic disorders, known to be associated with altered levels of catestatin and may, thus, provide a tractable target in the treatment and prevention of these disorders.",

    "abstract": "Neuraminidase (NA) of human influenza H3N2 virus has evolved rapidly and been accumulating mutations for more than half-century. However, biophysical constraints that govern the evolutionary trajectories of NA remain largely elusive. Here, we show that among 70 natural mutations that are present in the NA of a recent human H3N2 strain, >10% are deleterious for an ancestral strain. By mapping the permissive mutations using combinatorial mutagenesis and next-generation sequencing, an extensive epistatic network is revealed. Biophysical and structural analyses further demonstrate that certain epistatic interactions can be explained by non-additive stability effect, which in turn modulates membrane trafficking and enzymatic activity of NA. Additionally, our results suggest that other biophysical mechanisms also contribute to epistasis in NA evolution. Overall, these findings not only provide mechanistic insights into the evolution of human influenza NA and elucidate its sequence-structure-function relationship, but also have important implications for the development of next-generation influenza vaccines.",

Within memory B-cells, the reservoir for lifelong infection, EBV genomic DNA and histone methylation marks restrict gene expression. But, this epigenetic strategy also enables EBV-infected tumors, including Burkitt lymphomas to evade immune detection. Little is known about host cell metabolic pathways that support EBV epigenome landscapes. We therefore used amino acid restriction, metabolomic and CRISPR approaches to identify that an abundant methionine supply, and interconnecting methionine and folate cycles, maintain Burkitt EBV gene silencing. Methionine restriction, or methionine cycle perturbation, hypomethylated EBV genomes, de-repressed latent membrane protein and lytic gene expression. Methionine metabolism also shaped EBV latency gene regulation required for B-cell immortalization. Dietary methionine restriction altered murine Burkitt xenograft metabolomes and de-repressed EBV immunogens in vivo. These results highlight epigenetic/immunometabolism crosstalk supporting the EBV B-cell lifecycle and suggest therapeutic approaches.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMethionine metabolism is critical for Epstein-Barr virus B-cell latency\nC_LIO_LIExtensive cross-talk enables methionine metabolism to control the EBV epigenome\nC_LIO_LIMethionine restriction also impairs EBV-driven human B-cell immortalization\nC_LIO_LIDietary methionine restriction unmasks EBV antigens in Burkitt xenografts in vivo\nC_LI",

These dyes are marginally degradable and recalcitrant, hence alternatives to physical and chemical techniques like various bioremediation studies involving plants, plant roots, single or consortium of microbes have been used as environment friendly methods for the removal of textile dye. In the present study potent bacteria for dye decolourization were isolated from rhizospheric soil collected from Kamothe, Navi Mumbai, India. Of the 20 isolates obtained after enrichment, seven isolates were used for further screening of efficient decolourization ability in MBM media containing 10% glucose, 2.5 % trace metal solution and 0.1% of MO dye concentration. Physiological parameters to optimize the decolourization of dye at optimum pH, temperature and incubation time was studied for all the seven isolates. UV-vis and Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy were used to investigate dye decolorization. The seven isolates were characterized morphologically, biochemically, and molecular identification of these strains were performed by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. The isolates were identified as Bacillus paramycoides, Pseudomonas taiwanensis, Citrobacter murliniae, Acinetobacter pitti, Exiguobacterium acetylicum, Psychrobacter celer, and Aeromonas taiwanensis. Out of these Aeromonas taiwanensis has shown exceptional capacity by 100% decolorization of azo dye in minimum time.\n\n1.

    "abstract": "RNA viruses have limited coding capacity and must therefore successfully subvert cellular processes to facilitate their replication. A fundamental challenge faced by both viruses and their hosts is the ability to achieve the correct folding and assembly of their proteome while avoiding misfolding and aggregation. In cells, this process is facilitated by numerous chaperone systems together with a large number of co-chaperones. In this work, we set out to define the chaperones and co-chaperones involved in the replication of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Using an RNAi screen, we identify multiple members of cellular protein folding networks whose knockdown alters RSV replication. The reduced number of chaperones and co-chaperones identified in this work can facilitate the unmasking of specific chaperone subnetworks required for distinct steps of the RSV life cycle and identifies new potential targets for antiviral therapy. Indeed, we show that the pharmacological inhibition of one of the genes identified in the RNAi screen, valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97), can impede the replication of RSV by interfering with the infection cycle at multiple steps.",

While most species are restricted to specific hosts and cell types, Toxoplasma gondii can invade every nucleated cell derived from warm-blooded animals. This broad host range suggests that this parasite can recognize multiple host cell ligands or structures, leading to the activation of a central protein complex, which should be conserved in all apicomplexans. During invasion, the unique secretory organelles (micronemes and rhoptries) are sequentially released and several micronemal proteins have been suggested to be required for host cell recognition and invasion. However, to date only few micronemal proteins have been demonstrated to be essential for invasion.\n\nCysteine Repeat Modular Proteins (CRMPs) are a family of apicomplexan specific proteins. In Toxoplasma gondii, two CRMPs are present in the genome. The Kringle domain containing protein (CRMPA) and the GCC2 GCC3 domain containing protein (CRMPB). Here we demonstrate that both proteins form a complex that contains additional micronemal proteins. Disruption of this complex results in a block of rhoptry secretion and parasites being unable to invade the host cell. In conclusion, this complex is a central invasion complex conserved in all apicomplexans.",

    "abstract": "Cell-cell fusion is important for biological processes including fertilization, development, immunity, and microbial pathogenesis. Bacteria in the pseudomallei group of Burkholderia species, including B. thailandensis, spread between host cells by inducing cell-cell fusion. Previous work showed that B. thailandensis-induced cell-cell fusion requires intracellular bacterial motility and a bacterial protein secretion apparatus called the type VI secretion system-5 (T6SS-5), including the T6SS-5 protein VgrG5. However, the cellular level mechanism and T6SS-5 proteins important for bacteria-induced cell-cell fusion remained incompletely described. Using live cell imaging, we found bacteria used actin-based motility to push on the host cell plasma membrane to form plasma membrane protrusions that extended into neighboring cells. Then, membrane fusion occurred within these membrane protrusions, either proximal to the bacterium at the tip or elsewhere within a protrusion. Expression of VgrG5 by bacteria within membrane protrusions was required to promote cell-cell fusion. Furthermore, a second predicted T6SS-5 protein, TagD5, was also required for cell-cell fusion. In the absence of VgrG5 or TagD5, bacteria in plasma membrane protrusions were engulfed into neighboring cells. Our results suggest that the T6SS-5 effectors VgrG5 and TagD5 are secreted within membrane protrusions and act locally to promote membrane fusion.",

Persistence results in the relapse of infections by producing a tiny fraction of pathogen survivors that stay dormant during antibiotic exposure. From an evolutionary perspective, persistence is either a  bet-hedging strategy that helps to cope with stochastically changing environments or an unavoidable minimal rate of  cellular errors that lock the cells in a low activity state. Here, we analyzed the evolution of persistence over 50,000 bacterial generations in a stable environment by improving a published method that estimates the number of persister cells based on the growth of the reviving population. Our results challenged our understanding of the factors underlying persistence evolution. In one case, we observed a substantial decrease in persistence proportion, suggesting that the naturally observed persistence level is not an unavoidable minimal rate of  cellular errors. However, although there was no obvious environmental stochasticity, in 11 of the 12 investigated populations, the persistence level was maintained during 50,000 bacterial generations.",

    "abstract": "Friedreich ataxia, an autosomal recessive disorder is caused by tandem GAA nucleotide repeats expansion in intron 1 of the FXN (frataxin gene). The GAA repeats above 66 in length are considered as pathogenic and commonly occurring repeats are 600-1200. Clinically the spectrum of the features is confined mainly to the neurological tissue, however, cardiomyopathy and diabetes mellitus has been observed in 60% and 30% of the subjects. The accurate detection of GAA repeats count is of utmost importance for clinical genetic correlation as no study has attempted an approach which is of high throughput nature and defines the sequence of GAA repeats. Largely, the method for detection of GAA repeats so far is either conventional PCR based screening and southern blot which is the gold standard method. We describe for the first time a method of long read sequencing wherein we utilized approach of long range targeted amplification of FXN-GAA repeats and sequencing on oxford MinION platform. We were able to achieve the successful amplification of GAA repeats ranging from 180-1200 at 250x coverage. The total throughput achievable for 96 samples can be less than 24 hours on one flow cell as per our protocol and is scalable and deployable at clinical day to sequencing.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in the sensitivity and speed of mass spectrometers utilized for proteomics and metabolomics workflows has led to a dramatic increase in data file size and density. For a field already challenged by data complexity due to a dependence on desktop PC architecture and the Windows operating systems, further compromises appear inevitable as data density scales. As one method to reduce data complexity, we present herein a light-weight python script that can rapidly filter and provide analysis metrics from tandem mass spectra based on the presence and number of diagnostic fragment ions determined by the end user. Diagnostic Ion Data Analysis Reduction (DIDAR) can be applied to any mass spectrometry dataset to create smaller output files containing only spectra likely to contain post-translational modifications or chemical labels of interest. In this study we describe the application DIDAR within the context of multiplexed single cell proteomics workflows. When applied in this manner using reporter fragment ions as diagnostic signatures, DIDAR can provide quality control metrics based on the presence of reporter ions derived from single human cells and simplified output files for search engine analysis. The simple output metric text files can be used to rapidly flag entire LCMS runs with technical issues and remove them from downstream analysis based on end user minimum requirements. Acquisition files that pass these criteria are further improved through the automatic removal of spectra where insufficient signal from single cells is observed. We describe the application of DIDAR to two recently described multiplexed single cell proteomics datasets.\n\nAbstract Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=132 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481489v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (14K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1380a32org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@258660org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@199411eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@824aa1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, it is currently not scalable because of lacking ideal strains. Here, we explore hpm91, a previously reported PGR5-deletion mutant with remarkable H2 production, that possesses numerous valuable attributes towards large-scale application and in-depth study issues. We show that hpm91 is at least 100-fold scalable (upto 10 liter) with H2 collection sustained for averagely 26 days and 7287 ml H2/10L-HPBR. Also, hpm91 is robust and active over the period of sulfur-deprived H2 production, most likely due to decreased intracellular ROS relative to wild type. Moreover, quantitative proteomic analysis revealed its features in photosynthetic antenna, primary metabolic pathways and anti-ROS responses. Together with success of new high-H2-production strains derived from hpm91, we highlight that hpm91 is a potent strain toward basic and applied research of algal-H2 photoproduction.",

However, the limited in vitro catalytic activities described for these enzymes is at odds with their complex cellular roles, most notably in driving large-scale RNA remodeling steps during the assembly of ribonucleoproteins (RNPs). We describe cryo-EM structures of 60S ribosomal biogenesis intermediates that reveal how context-specific RNA unwinding by the DEAD-box ATPase Spb4 results in extensive, sequence-directed remodeling of rRNA secondary structure. Multiple cis and trans interactions stabilize a post-catalytic, high-energy intermediate that drives the organization of the root helix structure within rRNA domain IV.

They have become the major cause for hospital-acquired infections because once they form, they are very difficult to eradicate. Nanotechnology offers a new approach to fight biofilm-associated infections. Here, we report on the synthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with antibacterial ligand epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and the formation of lysozyme protein corona on AgNPs as shown by UV-Vis, dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism analyses. We further tested the activity of EGCG-AgNPs and their lysozyme bioconjugates on the viability of Bacillus subtilis cells and biofilm formation. Our results showed that, although EGCG-AgNPs presented no antibacterial activity on planktonic Bacillus subtilis cells, they inhibited B. subtilis biofilm formation at concentrations larger than 40 nM and EGCG-AgNP-lysozyme bioconjugates inhibited biofilms at concentrations above 80 nM. Cytotoxicity assays performed with human cells showed a reverse trend, where EGCG-AgNPs barely affected human cell viability, while EGCG-AgNP-lysozyme bioconjugates severely hampered viability. Our results therefore demonstrate that EGCG-AgNPs may be used as non-cytotoxic antibiofilm agents.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are two leading causes of severe respiratory infections in children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients. The fusion (F) protein is the major target of neutralizing antibodies. Recent developments in stabilizing the pre-fusion conformation of the F proteins, and identifying immunodominant epitopes that elicit potent neutralizing antibodies have led to testing of numerous pre-fusion RSV F-based vaccines in clinical trials. We designed and tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a chimeric fusion protein that contains immunodominant epitopes of RSV F and hMPV F (RHMS-1). RHMS-1 has several advantages over vaccination with pre-fusion RSV F or hMPV F, including a focus on recalling B cells to the most important protective epitopes and the ability to induce protection against two viruses with a single antigen. RHMS-1 was generated as a trimeric recombinant protein, and negative-stain EM analysis demonstrated the protein resembles the pre-fusion conformation. Probing of RHMS-1 antigenicity using a panel of RSV and hMPV F-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) revealed the protein retains features of both viruses, including the pre-fusion site O epitope of RSV F. BALB/c mice immunized with RHMS-1 had serum binding and neutralizing antibodies to both viruses. RHMS-1 vaccinated mice challenged with RSV or hMPV had undetectable virus in lung homogenates for both viruses, in contrast to RSV F or hMPV F vaccinated mice, which had detectable virus for hMPV and RSV, respectively. Overall, this study demonstrates protection against two viruses with a single antigen and supports further testing of RHMS-1 in additional pre-clinical animal models.\n\nSignificanceRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV) are two Pneumoviruses that cause substantial respiratory tract infections in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised adults. Yet vaccines against either of them are still unavailable. Multiple promising vaccine designs based on the fusion proteins of RSV and hMPV have been tested, but none of them can induce cross-protective antibody responses despite their similar structures and closely related amino acid sequence identity. Here, we report a vaccine candidate, RHMS-1, which combines the immunodominant epitopes of the RSV and hMPV fusion proteins into a single antigen. RHMS-1 maintains the immunological features of both RSV F and hMPV F, which can be recognized by epitope-specific mAbs and human B cells pre-exposed to RSV or hMPV. Furthermore, this is the first immunogen that induced potent cross-neutralizing antibodies and protected mice from RSV and hMPV challenge. Our results suggest RHMS-1 is a promising Pan-Pneumovirus vaccine.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the impact of host immunity on sexual reproduction in fungal pathogens. In particular, it is unclear whether crossing requires both sexual partners to infect living plant tissues. We addressed this issue in a three-year experiment investigating different scenarios of Zymoseptoria tritici crosses on wheat according to the virulence ( vir) or avirulence ( avr) of the parents against a qualitative resistance gene. Co-inoculations ( vir x vir,  avr x vir,  avr x avr) and single inoculations were performed on a cultivar carrying the resistance gene (Cellule) and a susceptible cultivar (Apache), in the greenhouse. We assessed the intensity of asexual multiplication by scoring disease severity, and the intensity of sexual reproduction by counting the ascospores discharged from wheat residues. As expected, disease severity was more intense on Cellule for  vir x vir co-inoculations than for  avr x vir co-inoculations, with no disease for  avr x avr. However, all types of co-inoculation yielded sexual offspring, whether or not the parental strains caused plant symptoms. Parenthood was confirmed by genotyping (SSR markers), and the occurrence of crosses between (co-)inoculated and exogenous strains (other strains from the experiment, or from far away) was determined. We found that symptomatic asexual infection was not required for a strain to participate in sexual reproduction, and that avirulent strains could be maintained asymptomatically \"on\" or \"in\" leaf tissues of plants carrying the corresponding resistant gene for long enough to reproduce sexually. In two of the three years, the intensity of sexual reproduction did not differ significantly between the three types of co-inoculation in Cellule, suggesting that crosses involving avirulent strains are not anecdotal. We discuss the possible mechanisms explaining the maintenance of avirulence in Z. tritici populations and supporting the potential efficacy of cultivar mixtures for limiting resistance gene breakdown.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAvirulent Zymoseptoria tritici strains can reproduce sexually in wheat plants carrying the corresponding resistant gene.\nC_LIO_LISymptomatic infection of plant tissues is not essential for a strain to reproduce sexually.\nC_LIO_LIAvirulent strains can be maintained asymptomatically \"on\" or \"in\" leaf tissues of plants carrying the corresponding resistant gene for long enough to reproduce sexually.\nC_LIO_LICrosses of virulent strains with virulent and avirulent strains in a plant host carrying the corresponding resistance gene can produce offspring with similar population sizes.\nC_LIO_LISeveral possible scenarios for sexual crosses can explain the maintenance of avirulence in Zymoseptoria tritici populations evolving in a wheat canopy, particular in cultivar mixtures.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) transactivator protein Tax has pleiotropic functions in the host cell affecting cell-cycle regulation, DNA damage response pathways and apoptosis. These actions of Tax have been implicated in the persistence and pathogenesis of HTLV-1-infected cells. It is now known that tax expression occurs in transcriptional bursts of the proviral plus-strand, but the effects of the burst on host transcription are not fully understood. We carried out RNA sequencing of two naturally-infected T-cell clones transduced with a Tax-responsive Timer protein, which undergoes a time-dependent shift in fluorescence emission, to study transcriptional changes during successive phases of the HTLV-1 plus-strand burst. We found that the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the NF-{kappa}B pathway, cell-cycle regulation, DNA damage response and apoptosis inhibition were immediate effects accompanying the plus-strand burst, and are limited to the duration of the burst. The results distinguish between the immediate and delayed effects of HTLV-1 reactivation on host transcription, and between clone-specific effects and those observed in both clones. The major transcriptional changes in the infected host T-cells observed here, including NF-kB, are transient, suggesting that these pathways are not persistently activated at high levels in HTLV-1-infected cells. The two clones diverged strongly in their expression of genes regulating the cell cycle. Up-regulation of senescence markers was a delayed effect of the proviral plus-strand burst and the up-regulation of some pro-apoptotic genes outlasted the burst. We found that activation of the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) pathway enhanced and prolonged the proviral burst, but did not increase the rate of reactivation. Our results also suggest that sustained plus-strand expression is detrimental to the survival of infected cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryHuman T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) causes a lifelong infection that results in disease in [~]10% of cases. The HTLV-1 transactivator protein Tax is involved in both the persistence of infected host cells, and the pathogenesis of HTLV-1 infection. tax is transcribed from the plus-strand of the provirus, and tax expression is not constitutive, but limited to transcriptional bursts. How these bursts affect host cell transcription is not completely understood. Here, we studied the temporal changes in host transcription during successive phases of the plus-strand burst in two naturally-infected T-cell clones. We found that the deregulation of genes involved in Tax-associated processes, including NF-{kappa}B activation, cell-cycle regulation, DNA damage response and suppression of apoptosis, coincided with the early phase of the plus-strand burst: these transcriptional effects appear to be limited to the duration of the proviral plus-strand expression. Regulation of cell-cycle genes diverged between the clones, demonstrating the heterogeneity of naturally-infected cells. We observed a pro-apoptotic response, which outlasted the burst and may indicate increased risk of apoptosis following the burst. Finally, we observed that AhR activity regulated the intensity and duration of the burst, but not the dynamics of reactivation.",

    "abstract": "The complex life cycle of Plasmodium parasites, the eukaryotic pathogens that cause malaria, features three distinct invasive forms tailored specifically to the equally distinct host environment they must navigate and invade for progression of the life cycle. One conserved feature of all these invasive forms is the presence of micronemes, apically oriented secretory organelles involved in egress, motility, adhesion and invasion. Micronemes are tailored to their specific host environment and feature stage specific contents. Here we investigate the role of GPI-anchored micronemal antigen (GAMA), which shows a micronemal localization in all zoite forms of the rodent infecting species Plasmodium berghei. While GAMA is dispensable during asexual blood stages, GAMA knock out parasites are severely defective for invasion of the mosquito midgut, resulting in reduced numbers of oocysts. Once formed, oocysts develop normally, however sporozoites are unable to egress and these sporozoites exhibit defective motility. Epitope-tagging of GAMA revealed tight temporal expression late during sporogony and showed that GAMA is shed during sporozoite gliding motility in a similar manner to circumsporozoite protein. Complementation of P. berghei knock out parasites with full length P. falciparum GAMA partially restored infectivity to mosquitoes, indicating a conservation of function across Plasmodium species. A suite of parasites with GAMA expressed under the promoters of the known ookinete-to-sporozoite stage-specific genes: CTRP, CAP380 and TRAP, further confirmed the involvement of GAMA in midgut infection, motility and infection of the mammalian host and revealed a lethal consequence to overexpression of GAMA during oocyst development. Combined, the research suggest that GAMA plays independent roles in sporozoite motility, egress and invasion, possibly implicating GAMA as a regulator of microneme function.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMalaria remains a major source of morbidity and mortality across the globe. Completion of a complex life cycle between vertebrates and mosquitoes is required for the maintenance of parasite populations and the persistence of malaria disease and death. Three invasive forms across the complex lifecycle of the parasite must successfully egress and invade specific cell types within the vertebrate and mosquito hosts to maintain parasite populations and consequently disease and suffering. A conserved feature of all invasive forms are the micronemes, apically oriented secretory organelles which contain proteins required for motility, egress and invasion. Few proteins are expressed in the micronemes of all three invasive forms. One such protein is GPI-anchored micronemal antigen (GAMA). Here we reveal that GAMA is required for the invasion of the mosquito midgut, egress of sporozoites from oocysts and invasion of the vertebrate host. Our finding indicate that while GAMA is essential for sporozoite motility, the defects in oocyst egress and hepatocyte invasion occur independently of the motility defect, implicating the requirement of GAMA in all three processes.",

    "abstract": "Rickettsia spp. are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that have evolved a variety of strategies to exploit their host cell niche. However, the bacterial factors that contribute to this intracellular lifestyle are poorly understood. Here, we show that the conserved ankyrin repeat protein RARP-1 supports Rickettsia parkeri infection. Specifically, RARP-1 promotes efficient host cell entry and growth within the host cytoplasm, but it is not necessary for cell-to-cell spread or evasion of host autophagy. We further demonstrate that RARP-1 is not secreted into the host cytoplasm by R. parkeri. Instead, RARP-1 resides in the periplasm, and we identify several binding partners that are predicted to work in concert with RARP-1 during infection. Altogether, our data reveal that RARP-1 plays a critical role in the rickettsial life cycle.\n\nImportanceRickettsia spp. are obligate intracellular bacterial pathogens that pose a growing threat to human health. Nevertheless, their strict reliance on a host cell niche has hindered investigation of the molecular mechanisms driving rickettsial infection. This study yields much needed insight into the Rickettsia ankyrin repeat protein RARP-1, which is conserved across the genus but has not yet been functionally characterized. Earlier work had suggested that RARP-1 is secreted into the host cytoplasm. However, the results from this work demonstrate that R. parkeri RARP-1 resides in the periplasm and is important both for invasion of host cells and for growth in the host cell cytoplasm. These results reveal RARP-1 as a novel regulator of the rickettsial life cycle.",

    "abstract": "Malaria transmission to humans begins with sporozoite infection of the liver. The elucidation of gene regulation during the sporozoite stage will promote the investigation of mechanisms of liver infection by this parasite and contribute to the development of strategies for preventing malaria transmission. AP2-Sp is a transcription factor (TF) essential for the formation of sporozoites or sporogony, which takes place in oocysts in the midgut of infected mosquitoes. To understand the role of this TF in the transcriptional regulatory system of this stage, we performed ChIP-seq analyses using whole mosquito midguts containing late oocysts as starting material and explored its genome-wide target genes. We identified 697 target genes, comprising those involved in distinct processes parasites experience during this stage, from sporogony to development into the liver-stage, and representing the majority of genes highly expressed in the sporozoite stage. These results suggest that AP2-Sp determines basal patterns of gene expression by targeting a broad range of genes directly. The ChIP-seq analyses also showed that AP2-Sp maintains its own expression by a transcriptional auto-activation mechanism (positive feedback loop) and induces all TFs reported to be transcribed at this stage, including AP2-Sp2, AP2-Sp3, and SLARP. The results showed that AP2-Sp exists at the top of the transcriptional cascade of this stage and triggers the formation of this stage as a master regulator.",

    "abstract": "To understand how a bacterium ultimately succeeds or fails in adapting to a new environment, it is essential to assess the temporal dynamics of its fitness over the course of colonization. The mammalian gut, into which exogenous microorganisms are regularly introduced, represents a biologically and clinically relevant system to explore microbial adaptational processes. In this study, we introduce a human-derived commensal organism, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, into the guts of germ-free mice to 1) determine whether the genetic requirements for colonization shift over time and, if so, 2) characterize the biological functions required for microbial survival at different points of colonization. The results of a high-throughput functional genetics assay (BarSeq), transcriptomics, and metabolomics converge on several conclusions. First, adaptation to the host gut occurs in distinct stages. We observed drastic changes in gene usage during the first week, shifting from high expression of amino acid biosynthesis to polysaccharide utilization genes. These changes were sustained thereafter, except for the continued upregulation of a single polysaccharide utilization locus responsible for the degradation of raffinose-family oligosaccharides rich in the standard chow diet fed to our mice. Spontaneous mutations in wildtype Bt also evolve around this locus, highlighting the importance of efficient carbohydrate metabolism in long-term persistence within a monoassociated gut. To improve microbiome-based therapies, it will be important to appreciate and meet the distinct needs of the organism during each stage of colonization.\n\nImportanceMicrobes regularly disperse across and adapt to new environments and ecological niches. A clinically significant microbial niche home to trillions of microbes is the mammalian gut. Temporal processes of microbial adaptation over the course of gut colonization are poorly understood on a genetic, transcriptional, and metabolite level. In this study, we leverage a three-pronged approach to characterize gut colonization as a dynamic process with shifting genetic determinants of microbial fitness. This study sheds light on host colonization by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an organism that is prevalent and dominant across healthy human microbiomes, and not only identifies key pathways involved in colonization, but determines the timing of when these pathways are most vital to colonization success. By demonstrating that the key determinants of colonization success in the gut change over time, the results of this study highlight the importance of considering ecological dynamics in developing more effective microbiome-based therapies.",

    "abstract": "Unlike many mammalian vital organs, the lung exhibits a robust, multifaceted regenerative response to severe injuries such as influenza infection, which primarily targets epithelial cells in the airways and alveoli. Quiescent lung-resident epithelial progenitors proliferate, migrate, and differentiate following lung injury, participating in two distinct reparative pathways: functionally beneficial regeneration and dysplastic tissue remodeling. Intrapulmonary airway-resident basal-like p63+ progenitors are one such progenitor cell type that migrates from the airways to form ectopic bronchiolar tissue in the alveoli, generating honeycomb-like cysts that fail to resolve after injury. Though this phenomenon is now well described, the cell-autonomous signals that drive dysplastic alveolar remodeling remain uncertain, a question made especially salient by observations that p63+ progenitors also expand dramatically upon diffuse alveolar damage in humans resulting from a variety of insults including SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS. Here we show that the master basal cell transcription factor {Delta}Np63 is required for the immense migratory capacity of intrapulmonary p63+ progenitors and consequently for the dysplastic repair pathway manifest by these cells. We further demonstrate that {Delta}Np63 restricts the fate plasticity of intrapulmonary p63+ progenitors by regulating their epigenetic landscape, and that loss of {Delta}Np63 alters the deposition of active and repressive histone modifications at key differentiation gene loci, allowing {Delta}Np63KO progenitors to proceed towards airway or alveolar differentiation depending on their surrounding environment. These insights into the regulatory mechanisms of dysplastic repair and intrapulmonary p63+ progenitor fate choice highlight potential therapeutic targets to promote more effective alveolar regeneration following severe lung injuries.",

    "abstract": "Major stress has systemic effects on the body that can have adverse consequences for physical and mental health. However, the molecular basis of these damaging effects remains incompletely understood. Here we use a longitudinal approach to characterise the acute systemic impact of major psychological stress in a pig model. We perform untargeted metabolomics on non-invasively-obtained saliva samples from pigs before and 24-hours after transfer to the novel physical and social environment of a slaughterhouse. The main molecular changes occurring include decreases in amino acids, B-vitamins, and amino acid-derived metabolites synthesized in B-vitamin-dependent reactions, as well as yet-unidentified metabolite features. Decreased levels of several of the identified metabolites are implicated in the pathology of human psychological disorders and neurodegenerative disease, suggesting a possible neuroprotective function. Our results provide a fingerprint of the acute effect of psychological stress on the metabolome and suggest candidate biomarkers with potential roles in stress-related disorders.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryIdentification of metabolites decreased under acute psychological stress may lead to future discoveries for the prevention and treatment of stress-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "In most eukaryotic organisms, cilia perform a variety of life-sustaining roles related to environmental sensing and motility. Cryo-electron microscopy has provided considerable insight into the morphology and function of ciliary structures, but studies have been limited to less than a dozen of the millions of known eukaryotic species. Ultrastructural information is particularly lacking for unicellular organisms in the opisthokont clade, leaving a sizeable gap in our understanding of cilia evolution between unicellular species and multicellular metazoans (animals). Choanoflagellates are important aquatic heterotrophs, uniquely positioned within the opisthokonts as the metazoans closest living unicellular relatives. We performed cryo-focused ion beam milling and cryo-electron tomography on cilia from the choanoflagellate species Salpingoeca rosetta. We show that the axonemal dyneins, radial spokes, and central pair complex in S. rosetta more closely resemble metazoan structures than those of unicellular organisms from other suprakingdoms. In addition, we describe unique features of S. rosetta cilia, including microtubule holes, microtubule inner proteins, and the ciliary vane: a fine, net-like extension that has been notoriously difficult to visualize using other methods. Furthermore, we report barb-like structures of unknown function on the extracellular surface of the ciliary membrane. Together, our findings provide new insights into choanoflagellate biology and cilia evolution between unicellular and multicellular opisthokonts.",

    "abstract": "Salt taste sensation is multifaceted: NaCl at low or high concentrations is preferably or aversively perceived through distinct pathways. Cl- is thought to participate in taste sensation through an unknown mechanism. Here we describe Cl- ion binding and the response of taste receptor type 1 (T1r), a receptor family composing sweet/umami receptors. The T1r2a/T1r3 heterodimer from the medaka fish, currently the sole T1r amenable to structural analyses, exhibited a specific Cl- binding in the vicinity of the amino-acid-binding site in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of T1r3, which is likely conserved across species, including human T1r3. The Cl- binding induced a conformational change in T1r2a/T1r3LBD at sub-to low-mM concentrations similar to canonical taste substances. Furthermore, oral Cl- application to mice increased impulse frequencies of taste nerves connected to T1r-expressing taste cells and promoted their behavioral preferences attenuated by a T1r-specific blocker or T1r3 knock-out. These results suggest that the Cl- evokes taste sensations by binding to T1r, thereby serving as another preferred salt taste pathway at a low concentration.",

    "abstract": "Infection with the human-tropic Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a strong risk factor for multiple sclerosis (MS), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To investigate the immunomodulatory effects of latent EBV infection, we induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in immunocompromised mice humanized with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with or without a history of EBV infection and/or a diagnosis of relapsing MS. HuPBMC EAE mice generated from EBV seronegative healthy donors were less susceptible to developing severe clinical disease than EBV seropositive healthy donor and RRMS cohorts. Donor EBV seropositivity and RRMS led to a significant incremental increase in the number of brain and spinal cord infiltrating effector T cells, in the absence of viral reactivation, due to enhanced proliferation of donor T cells and reduced regulatory T cell expansion. The data indicate that a history of EBV infection, further compounded by a diagnosis of RRMS, promotes T cell-mediated disease in a novel humanized mouse model of MS.\n\nSUMMARYIn a novel humanized mouse model of multiple sclerosis (MS), donor history of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection exacerbates disease severity by skewing the balance of effector and regulatory T cells in the brain and spinal cord. These results reveal an immunomodulatory mechanism by which latent EBV infection could predispose to the development of autoimmune disease.",

Given their opportunistic, omnivorous nature the consumptive and competitive impacts of house mice on islands have the potential to vary over time in concert with resource availability and mouse population dynamics.\n\nMethodsWe examined the ecological niche of invasive house mice on Southeast Farallon Island, California, USA using a combination of mouse trapping, food resource surveys, and stable isotope analysis to better understand their trophic interactions with native flora and fauna.\n\nResultsWe found that plants were the important resource for house mice during the spring months when vegetation is abundant and mouse populations are low. However, plants decline in dietary importance throughout the summer and fall as mouse populations increase, and seabird and insect resources become relatively more available and consumed by house mice. Mouse abundance peaks and other resource availability are low in the fall months when the isotopic niches of house mice and salamanders overlap significantly indicating the potential for competition, most likely for insect prey.\n\nDiscussionThese results indicate how seasonal shifts in both the mouse abundance and resource availability are key factors that mediate the consumptive and competitive impacts of introduced house mice on this island ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "Daphnia, an ecologically important zooplankton species in lakes, shows both genetic adaptation and phenotypic plasticity in response to temperature and fish predation, but little is known about the molecular basis of these responses and their potential interactions. We performed a factorial experiment exposing laboratory-propagated Daphnia pulicaria clones from two lakes in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California to normal or high temperature (15{degrees}C or 25{degrees}C) in the presence or absence of fish kairomones, then measured changes in life history and gene expression. Exposure to kairomones increased upper thermal tolerance limits for physiological activity in both clones. Cloned individuals matured at a younger age in response to higher temperature and kairomones, while size at maturity, fecundity and population intrinsic growth were only affected by temperature. At the molecular level, both clones expressed more genes differently in response to temperature than predation, but specific genes involved in metabolic, cellular, and genetic processes responded differently between the two clones. Although gene expression differed more between clones from different lakes than experimental treatments, similar phenotypic responses to predation risk and warming arose from these clone-specific patterns. Our results suggest that phenotypic plasticity responses to temperature and kairomones interact synergistically, with exposure to fish predators increasing the tolerance of Daphnia pulicaria to stressful temperatures, and that similar phenotypic responses to temperature and predator cues can be produced by divergent patterns of gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplast metabolism is very sensitive to environmental fluctuations and is intimately related to plant leaf development. Characterization of the chloroplast proteome dynamics may contribute to enlarge the understanding on plant adaptation to different climate scenarios and leaf development processes. Herein, we carried out a discovery-driven proteome analysis of the Eucalyptus grandis chloroplast proteome during leaf maturation and throughout different seasons of the year. The chloroplast proteome from young leaves differed the most from all assessed samples. Most up-regulated proteins identified in mature and young leaves were those related to catabolic-redox signaling and biogenesis processes, respectively. Seasonal dynamics revealed unique proteome features in the autumn and spring periods. The most abundant chloroplast protein in humid (wet) seasons (spring and summer) was a small subunit of RuBisCO, while in the dry periods (fall and winter) the proteins that showed the most pronounced accumulation were associated with photo-oxidative damage, Calvin cycle, shikimate pathway, and detoxification. Our investigation of the chloroplast proteome dynamics during leaf development revealed significant alterations in relation to the maturation event. Our findings also suggest that transient seasons induced the most pronounced chloroplast proteome changes over the year. This study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding on the subcellular mechanisms that lead to plant leaf adaptation and ultimately to Eucalyptus grandis productivity.
