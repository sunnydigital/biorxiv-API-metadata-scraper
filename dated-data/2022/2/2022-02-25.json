    "abstract": "Cytological data from flowering plants suggest that the evolution of recombination rates is affected by the mating system of organisms, as higher chiasma frequencies are often observed in self-fertilizing species compared with their outcrossing relatives. Understanding the evolutionary cause of this effect is of particular interest, as it may shed light on the selective forces favoring recombination in natural populations. While previous models showed that inbreeding may have important effects on selection for recombination, existing analytical treatments are restricted to the case of loosely linked loci and weak selfing rates, and ignore the effect of genetic interference (Hill-Robertson effect), known to be an important component of selection for recombination in randomly mating populations. In this article, we derive general expressions quantifying the stochastic and deterministic components of selection acting on a mutation affecting the genetic map length of a whole chromosome along which deleterious mutations occur, valid for arbitrary selfing rates. The results show that selfing generally increases selection for recombination caused by interference among mutations as long as selection against deleterious alleles is sufficiently weak. While interference is often the main driver of selection for recombination under tight linkage or high selfing rates, deterministic effects can play a stronger role under intermediate selfing rates and high recombination, selecting against recombination in the absence of epistasis, but favoring recombination when epistasis is negative. Individual-based simulation results indicate that our analytical model often provides accurate predictions for the strength of selection on recombination under partial selfing.",

    "abstract": "Immune surveillance escape is a hallmark of tumorigenesis1. Multiple studies have characterized the immune escape landscape across several untreated early-stage primary cancer types2-4. However, whether late-stage treated metastatic tumors present differences in genetic immune escape (GIE) prevalence and dynamics remains unclear. Here, we performed a pan-cancer characterization of GIE prevalence across six immune escape pathways in 6,457 uniformly processed Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) tumor samples including 58 cancer types from 1,943 primary untreated patients and 4,514 metastatic patients. To effectively address the complexity of the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA-I) locus and to characterize its tumor status, we developed LILAC, an open-source integrative framework. We demonstrate that one in four tumors harbor GIE alterations, with high mechanistic and frequency variability across cancer types. GIE prevalence is highly consistent between primary and metastatic tumors for most cancer types with few exceptions such as prostate and thyroid carcinomas that have increased immune evasion frequencies in metastatic tumors. Positive selection analysis revealed that GIE alterations are frequently selected for in tumor evolution and that focal LOH of HLA-I, unlike non-focal LOH of HLA-I, tends to lose the HLA allele that presents the largest neoepitope repertoire. We also unraveled tumor genomic features contributing to immune escape incidence, including DNA repair deficiency, APOBEC activity, tobacco associated mutation load and viral DNA integration. Finally, there is a strong tendency for mid and high tumor mutation burden (TMB) tumors to preferentially select LOH of HLA-I for GIE whereas hypermutated samples favor global immune evasion strategies. Our results indicate that genetic immune escape is generally a pre-metastatic event during tumor evolution and that tumors adapt different strategies depending on their neoepitope burden.",

    "abstract": "Obesity prevalence has reached pandemic proportions, leaving individuals at high risk for the development of diseases such as cancer and type 2 diabetes. In obesity, to accommodate excess lipid storage, adipocytes become hypertrophic, which is associated with an increased pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and dysfunction of metabolic processes such as insulin signaling and lipolysis. Targeting adipocyte dysfunction is an important strategy to prevent the development of obesity-associated disease. However, it is unclear how accurately animal models reflect human biology, and the long-term culture of human hypertrophic adipocytes in an in vitro 2D monolayer is challenging due to the buoyant nature of adipocytes. Here we describe the development of a human 3D in vitro disease model that recapitulates hallmarks of obese adipocyte dysfunction. First, human primary adipose-derived stromal cells are embedded in hydrogel, and infiltrated into a thin cellulose scaffold. The thin microtissue profile allows for efficient assembly and image-based analysis. After adipocyte differentiation, the scaffold is stimulated with oleic or palmitic acid to mimic caloric overload. Using functional assays, we demonstrated that this treatment induced important obese adipocyte characteristics such as a larger lipid droplet size, increased basal lipolysis, insulin resistance and activation of macrophages through adipocyte-conditioned media. This 3D disease model mimics physiologically relevant hallmarks of obese adipocytes, to enable investigations into the mechanisms by which dysfunctional adipocytes contribute to disease.",

While machine learning algorithms are a promising approach to detect upper limb use, there is currently no knowledge of the information used by these methods, and the data-related factors that influence their performance. A comparison of existing methods was carried out using data from a previous study which was collected from 10 unimpaired and 5 hemiparetic subjects, with annotation to identify periods of functional and non-functional upper limb use. Intra-subject random forest machine learning measures were found to classify upper limb use more accurately than other measures. The random forest measure uses information about the orientation and the amount of movement of the forearm to detect upper limb use. The types of movements and the proportion of functional data included in training/testing set influences the performance of machine learning measures. This study presents the first step towards understanding and optimizing machine learning methods for upper limb use assessment using wearable sensors.",

Motivated by fine-mapping applications in statistical genetics, we refer to our framework as an \"ensemble of single-effect neural networks\" (ESNN) which generalizes the \"sum of single-effects\" regression framework by both accounting for nonlinear structure in genotypic data (e.g., dominance effects) and having the capability to model discrete phenotypes (e.g., case-control studies). Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate our methods ability to produce calibrated posterior summaries such as credible sets and posterior inclusion probabilities, particularly for traits with genetic architectures that have significant proportions of non-additive variation driven by correlated variants. Lastly, we use real data to demonstrate that the ESNN framework improves upon the state-of-the-art for identifying true effect variables underlying various complex traits.",

Data integration aims to place cells, captured with different technologies, onto a common embedding to facilitate downstream analytical tasks. Current horizontal data integration techniques use a set of common features, thereby ignoring non-overlapping features and losing information. Here we introduce StabMap, a mosaic data integration technique that stabilises mapping of single cell data by exploiting the non-overlapping features. StabMap is a flexible approach that first infers a mosaic data topology, then projects all cells onto supervised or unsupervised reference coordinates by traversing shortest paths along the topology. We show that StabMap performs well in various simulation contexts, facilitates disjoint mosaic data integration, and enables the use of novel spatial gene expression features for mapping dissociated single cell data onto a spatial transcriptomic reference.",

    "abstract": "Inspired by recent experiments on the spontaneous assembly of virus-like particles from a solution containing a synthetic coat protein and double-stranded DNA, (1) we put forward a kinetic model that has as main ingredients a stochastic nucleation and a deterministic growth process. The efficiency and rate of the packaging of the DNA turn out to strongly increase by introducing proteins onto the DNA template that are modified using CRISPR-Cas techniques to bind specifically at predesignated locations, mimicking assembly signals in viruses. Our model shows that treating these proteins as nucleation-inducing diffusion barriers is sufficient to explain experimentally observed increase in encapsulation efficiency, but only if the nucleation rate is sufficiently high. We find an optimum in the encapsulation kinetics for conditions where the number of packaging signals is equal to the number of nucleation events that can occur during time required to fully encapsulate the DNA template, presuming that the nucleation events can only take place adjacent to a packaging signal. Our theory is in satisfactory agreement with the available experimental data.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe rate and efficiency of the encapsulation of double-stranded DNA by synthetic coat proteins was recently found to be strongly enhanced by the presence of specifically positioned protein molecules on the DNA that mimic so-called packaging signals. We present a kinetic theory based on the initial stochastic nucleation and subsequent deterministic elongation of the protein coat with the aim to explain these findings. We find that equidistantly placed nucleation sites that also act as diffusion barriers on the DNA have profound and non-trivial effects, and they can either slow down or speed up encapsulation, depending on how fast nucleation is on the time scale of the elongation process. Our findings may contribute to the rational design of linear virus-like particles.",

This causes intracellular endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention of the misfolded collagen and can result in a pathological ER stress response. A therapeutic approach to reduce this toxic mutant load could be to stimulate mutant collagen degradation by manipulating autophagy and/or ER-associated degradation. Since carbamazepine (CBZ) both stimulates autophagy of misfolded collagen X and improves skeletal pathology in a metaphyseal chondrodysplasia model, we tested the effect of CBZ on bone structure and strength in 3 week-old male OI Col1a2 +/p.G610C and control mice. Treatment for 3 or 6 weeks with CBZ, at the dose effective in metaphyseal chondrodysplasia, provided no therapeutic benefit to Col1a2 +/p.G610C mouse bone structure, strength, or composition, measured by micro-computed tomography, three point bending tests and Fourier-transform infrared microspectroscopy. In control mice however, CBZ treatment for 6 weeks impaired femur growth and led to lower femoral cortical and trabecular bone mass. These data, showing the negative impact of CBZ treatment on the developing mouse bones, raise important issues which must be considered in any human clinical applications of CBZ in growing individuals.",

To understand the possible behaviors of such systems, phase portrait diagrams can be used to visualize their overall global dynamics across a domain. However, producing these phase portrait diagrams is a laborious process reserved to mathematical experts. Here, we developed a computational methodology to automatically generate phase portrait diagrams to study biological dynamical systems based on ordinary differential equations. The method only needs as input the variables and equations describing a multidimensional biological system and it automatically outputs for each pair of dependent variables a complete phase portrait diagram, including the critical points and their stability, the nullclines of the system, and a vector space of the trajectories. Crucially, the portraits generated are interactive, and the user can move the visualized planar slice, change parameters with sliders, and add trajectories in the phase and time domains, after which the diagrams are updated in real time. The method is available as a user-friendly graphical interface or can be accessed programmatically with a Mathematica package. The generated portraits and particular views can be saved as computable notebooks preserving the interactive functionality, an approach that can be adopted for reproducible science and interactive pedagogical materials.

Although numerous studies demonstrated enhanced unimodal sensory functions at both neural and behavioral levels in skilled individuals, little is known about their multisensory interaction, especially multisensory integration and selective attention that involve volitional control of information derived from multiple sensory organs. Here, we show unique multisensory interaction functions of expert pianists. Expert pianists and musically untrained individuals performed five sets of intensity discrimination tasks at the auditory and somatosensory modalities with different conditions: (1) auditory stimulus, (2) somatosensory stimulus, (3) congruent auditory and somatosensory stimuli (i.e., multisensory integration), (4) auditory and task-irrelevant somatosensory stimuli, and (5) somatosensory and task-irrelevant auditory stimuli. In the fourth and fifth conditions, participants were instructed to ignore a task-irrelevant stimulus and to pay attention to a task-relevant stimulus (i.e., selective attention). The unimodal intensity discrimination of the pianists was superior to that of the nonmusicians at the auditory modality but not at the somatosensory modality. While the discrimination perception was superior in the condition (3) compared to the better one of the individual unimodal conditions (i.e., conditions 1 and 2) only in the pianists, the task-irrelevant somatosensory stimulus worsened the auditory discrimination more in the pianists than the nonmusicians. These findings indicate efficient processing of multisensory information in expert pianists, which enables to benefit from multisensory integration of the auditory and somatosensory information, but exacerbates top-down selective inhibition of somatosensory information during auditory processing.",

However, in most such studies, prediction performance ranged from moderate to disappointing.

Here, we systematically assess the effect of sample size on prediction performance using sample sizes far beyond what is possible in common neuroimaging studies. We project 3-9 fold improvements in prediction performance for behavioral and mental health phenotypes when moving from one thousand to one million samples. Moreover, we find that moving from single imaging modalities to multimodal input data can lead to further improvements in prediction performance, often on par with doubling the sample size. Our analyses reveal considerable performance reserves for neuroimaging-based phenotype prediction.

To determine these relationships, we recorded spiking activity in mouse forelimb M1 and S1 and tongue/jaw M1. Activity in all areas was strongly modulated in close association with discrete active manipulation events that occurred intermittently as mice fed. Each areas activity was also partly distinct in its overall timing and phasic/tonic temporal profile, attributable to area-specific composition of activity classes. Forelimb position could be accurately predicted from activity in all three regions. These results thus establish that cortical activity during food-handling is manipulation-specific, distributed, and broadly similar across multiple cortical areas, while also exhibiting area- and submovement-specific relationships with the fast kinematic hallmarks of this form of complex, free-object-handling manual dexterity.",

    "abstract": "In birds, like in mammals, the hippocampus critically mediates spatial navigation through the formation of a spatial map. This study investigates the impact of active exploration of a novel environment on the hippocampus of young domestic chicks, during formation of a new spatial map. Chicks that were free to actively explore the novel environment exhibited a significantly higher neural activation (measured by c-Fos expression), compared to those that passively observed the novel environment from a restricted area. The difference was limited to the anterior and the dorsolateral parts of the intermediate hippocampus. Furthermore, the nucleus taeniae of the amygdala showed a higher c-Fos expression in the active exploration group than the passive observation group. In both brain regions, brain activation correlated with the number of locations that chicks visited during the test. This suggest that the increase of c-Fos expression in the hippocampus is related to increased firing rates of spatially coding neurons. Furthermore, our study indicates a functional linkage of the hippocampus and nucleus taeniae of the amygdala in processing spatial information. Overall, with the present study, we confirm that, in birds like in mammals, exploration of novel environments activates hippocampus, which is likely related to the formation of new spatial representations.\n\nSummary statementActive exploration of a novel environment induces stronger activation of hippocampus and taeniae of domestic chicks than pure visual, passive exploration from a restricted area.",

An anatomical template of the semi-circular canals was fit to the T2 anatomical image from each subject, and used to derive the angle of the B0 magnetic field with respect to the vestibular apparatus.\n\nResultsRecordings from 37 subjects yielded valid measures of eye movements. The population-mean SPV {+/-} SD for the horizontal component was -1.38 {+/-} 1.27 deg/sec, and vertical component was -0.93 {+/-} 1.44 deg/sec, corresponding to drift movement in the rightward and downward direction. Although there was substantial inter-subject variability, persistent nystagmus was present in half of subjects with no significant adaptation over the 20 minute scanning period. The amplitude of vertical drift was correlated with the roll angle of the vestibular system, with a non-zero vertical SPV present at a 0 degree roll.\n\nInterpretationNon-habituating vestibular signals of varying amplitude are present in resting state data collected at 3T.",

    "abstract": "The projection neurons (PNs), reconstructed from electron microscope (EM) images of the Drosophila olfactory system, offer a detailed view of neuronal anatomy, providing glimpses into information flow in the brain. About 150 uPNs constituting 58 glomeruli in the antennal lobe (AL) are bundled together in the axonal extension, routing the olfactory signal received at AL to mushroom body (MB) calyx and lateral horn (LH). Here we quantify the neuronal organization by inter-PN distances and examine its relationship with the odor types sensed by Drosophila. The homotypic uPNs that constitute glomeruli are tightly bundled and stereotyped in position throughout the neuropils, even though the glomerular PN organization in AL is no longer sustained in the higher brain center. Instead, odor-type dependent clusters consisting of multiple homotypes innervate the MB calyx and LH. Pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes are spatially segregated in MB calyx, whereas two distinct clusters of food-related homotypes are found in LH in addition to the segregation of pheromone-encoding and hygro/thermo-sensing homotypes. We find that there are statistically significant associations between the spatial organization among a group of homotypic uPNs and certain stereotyped olfactory responses. Additionally, the signals from some of the tightly bundled homotypes converge to a specific group of lateral horn neurons (LHNs), which indicates that homotype (or odor type) specific integration of signals occurs at the synaptic interface between PNs and LHNs. Our findings suggest that before neural computation in the inner brain, some of the olfactory information are already encoded in the spatial organization of uPNs, illuminating that a certain degree of labeled-line strategy is at work in the Drosophila olfactory system.",

    "abstract": "Visual information can be stored as continuous as well as categorical representations in visual working memory (VWM) to guide subsequent behavior. Yet it is still unclear what determines whether VWM is represented as continuous or categorical information, or as a mix of both. Recent studies have shown that color VWM representations adjust flexibly depending on the number of memory items as well as the duration that these items need to be maintained for. The current study aims to extend and replicate these crucial effects. In a delayed estimation task, participants memorized one to four colored objects presented at different spatial locations, followed by a delay of 100, 500, 1,000, or 2,000 ms. Next, a probe indicated the location of the color that participants needed to report. We measured the extent to which responses were biased in the direction of prototypical colors. Crucially, we implemented this categorical bias in an extension to the classic mixture model (Zhang & Luck 2008) in which the center of the error distribution is a crucial parameter that characterizes the extent to which VWM is biased by color categories. We found that VWM shows a strong categorical bias in all cases, and that this bias increases with increasing memory load; strikingly, this effect of memory load on categorical bias is stronger at longer intervals (1,000 ms or longer), as compared to shorter intervals, yet it peaks for intermediate memory loads as opposed to the highest memory load. Overall, our results suggest that when visual information needs to be maintained for one second or longer, VWM becomes more reliant on categorical representations as memory load increases.",

In a mouse model of congenital myopathy, heterozygous Acta1 (H40Y) knock-in (Acta1+/Ki) mice exhibit features of human nemaline myopathy, including premature lethality, severe muscle weakness, reduced mobility, and the presence of nemaline rods in muscle fibers. In this study, we investigated the structure and function of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in the Acta1+/Ki mice. We found marked impairments in NMJ structure in the mutant mice, including fragmented endplates and nerve terminals, reduced density of acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) on endplate membranes, reduced nerve occupancy at endplates, and increased numbers of muscle fiber subsynaptic nuclei. We compared the NMJs in three different types of muscles - the extensor digitorum longus (EDL, composed of fast-twitch muscle fibers), soleus (Sol, enriched in slow-twitch fibers) and the triangularis sterni muscle (TS, a mixed fiber type muscle). Among these three types of muscles, EDL was affected to the greatest extent, suggesting that fast-twitch fibers may be most susceptible to NMJ fragmentation in Acta1+/Ki nemaline myopathy.\n\nElectrophysiological analysis of mutant NMJs showed a reduced quantal size (reduced mEPP amplitude), increased mEPP frequency, and increased quantal content, but normal EPP amplitude compared to wild type (WT) NMJs.

    "abstract": "Despite the fundamental importance of visual motion processing, our understanding of how the brain represents basic aspects of motion is incomplete. While it is generally believed that direction is the main representational feature of motion, motion processing is also influenced by non-directional orientation signals that are present in most motion stimuli. Here, we aimed to test whether this non-directional motion axis determines motion perception even when orientation is completely absent from the stimulus. Using stimuli with and without orientation signals, we found that serial dependence in a simple motion direction estimation task was predominantly determined by the orientation of the previous motion stimulus. Moreover, the observed attraction profiles closely matched the characteristic pattern of serial attraction found in orientation perception. Evidently, the sequential integration of motion signals depends solely on the orientation of motion, indicating a fundamental role of non-directional orientation in the coding of visual motion direction.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphThe hippocampus is a vertebrate brain structure that expresses spatial representations1 and is critical for navigation2,3. Navigation in turn intricately depends on locomotion; however, current accounts suggest a dissociation between hippocampal spatial representations and the details of locomotor processes. Specifically, the hippocampus is thought to primarily represent higher-order cognitive and locomotor variables like position, speed, and direction of movement4-7, while the limb movements that propel the animal are thought to be computed and represented primarily in subcortical circuits, including the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum8-11. Whether hippocampal representations are actually decoupled from the detailed structure of locomotor processes remains unknown. To address this question, we simultaneously monitored hippocampal spatial representations and ongoing limb movements underlying locomotion at fast timescales. We found that the forelimb stepping cycle in freely behaving rats is rhythmic and peaks at ~8 Hz during movement, matching the ~8 Hz organization of information processing in the hippocampus during locomotion12. We also discovered precisely timed coordination between the time at which the forelimbs touch the ground ( plant times of the stepping cycle) and the hippocampal representation of space. Notably, plant times coincide with hippocampal representations closest to the actual position of the animal, while in-between these plant times, the hippocampal representation progresses towards possible future locations. This synchronization was specifically detectable when animals approached upcoming spatial decisions. Taken together, our results reveal profound and dynamic coordination on a timescale of tens of milliseconds between central cognitive representations and peripheral motor processes. This coordination engages and disengages rapidly in association with cognitive demands and is well suited to support rapid information exchange between cognitive and sensory-motor circuits.",

    "abstract": "Chronic migraine is characterised by persistent headaches for more than 15 days per month; the intensity of the pain is fluctuating over time. Here, we explored the dynamic interplay of connectivity patterns between regions known to be related to pain processing and their relation to the ongoing dynamic pain experience. We recorded EEG from 80 sessions (20 chronic migraine patients in 4 separate sessions of 25 minutes). The patients were asked to continuously rate the intensity of their endogenous headache. On different time-windows, a dynamic causal model (DCM) of cross spectral responses was inverted to estimate connectivity strengths. For each patient and session, the evolving dynamics of effective connectivity were related to pain intensities and to pain intensity changes by using a Bayesian linear model. Hierarchical Bayesian modelling was further used to examine which connectivity-pain relations are consistent across sessions and across patients.\n\nThe results reflect the multi-facetted clinical picture of the disease. Across all sessions, each patient with chronic migraine exhibited a distinct pattern of pain intensity-related cortical connectivity. The diversity of the individual findings are accompanied by inconsistent relations between the connectivity parameters and pain intensity or pain intensity changes at group level. This suggests a rejection of the idea of a common neuronal core problem for chronic migraine.",

The role of KIAA1109 in mammalian development and function remains poorly understood. Here, we characterize mutant mice deficient in Kiaa1109 (Kiaa1109-/-). We report that Kiaa1109-/- mice died during perinatal stages. These Kiaa1109-/- embryos exhibited impaired intramuscular nerve growth and reduced sizes of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) compared with their littermate controls. Electrophysiological analysis further revealed defects in neuromuscular synaptic transmission in Kiaa1109-/- embryos. Notably, the frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release was markedly increased, whereas evoked neurotransmitter release and quantal content were reduced. Furthermore, neuromuscular synapses in Kiaa1109-/- embryos failed to respond to a repetitive, low frequency stimulation (10Hz). These results demonstrate that KIAA1109 is required for survival in mice and for proper development and function of the NMJ.\n\nSignificance StatementThis is the first report characterizing the phenotype of mutant mice deficient in KIAA1109 (4932438A13Rik), a novel gene in mammals.

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic biomolecules comprised of an extracellular antigen recognition domain and intracellular signaling domains. When expressed in immune cells, CARs direct their host cells to kill diseased cells expressing the antigen recognized by the CAR. Although signaling pathways downstream of CAR activation control the cytotoxic function of CAR-expressing cells, phospho-proteomic studies of CAR signaling have been limited. Most approaches have used antibodies or soluble ligands, rather than cell-displayed antigens, to activate CAR signaling. Here, we demonstrate an efficient and cost-effective label-free phospho-proteomic approach to analyze CAR signaling in immune cells stimulated with antigen-presenting cancer cells. Following co-culture of CAR-T cells with cancer cells, we first preserve phospho-signaling by cross-linking proteins with formalin. Then, we use magnet-activated cell sorting (MACS) to isolate CAR-T cells from the co-culture. Validation experiments demonstrated that formalin fixation did not alter the phospho-proteome and that MACS achieved >90% CAR-T cell purity. Next, we compared the phospho-proteome in CAR-T cells stimulated with either CD19-expressing or non-CD19-expressing SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells. This analysis revealed that CAR signaling activated known pathways including the mitogen- activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2. Bioinformatic approaches further showed that CAR activation induced other signaling pathways including the MAPK p38, protein kinase A, and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1). Taken together, this work presents an easy and inexpensive method to better understand CAR immunotherapy by label-free phospho-proteomic analysis of CAR signaling in immune cells stimulated by antigen- presenting cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Among circulating influenza viruses in humans, H3N2 viruses typically evolve faster than other subtypes and have caused severe illness and deaths in millions of people since emerging in 1968. Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) technology is one strategy to broaden vaccine-elicited antibody responses among influenza subtypes. In this study, we determined the structural integrity of an H3N2 COBRA HA, TJ5, and, as nearly all humans have pre-existing immunity to H3N2 influenza viruses, we probed the antigenic profile of several H3N2 COBRA HAs by assessing recognition of these immunogens by human B cells and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Of three recently described COBRA H3 HA antigens (TJ5, NG2, and J4), we determined that TJ5 and J4 HA proteins recognize pre-existing B cells (from the 2017-2018 vaccine season) more effectively than NG2 HA and a wild type Hong Kong/4801/2014 protein. H3 HA-specific human mAbs recognize wild type and COBRA HA proteins, and have functional activity against a broad panel of H3N2 viruses. mAb TJ5-5 recognizes TJ5 and J4 HA proteins, but has poor recognition of NG2 HA, similar to the global B cell analysis. To probe these recognition differences and to verify the structural integrity of the TJ5 HA protein, we determined a 3.4 [A] structure via cryo-electron microscopy of TJ5-5 complexed with the TJ5 HA, which revealed residues important to the differential binding. Overall, these studies determined that COBRA H3 HA proteins have correct antigenic and structural features, and are recognized by B cells and mAbs isolated from seasonally vaccinated humans.\n\nImportanceVaccine development for circulating influenza viruses, particularly for the H3N2 subtype, remains challenging due to consistent antigenic drift. Computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA) technology has proven effective for broadening influenza hemagglutinin (HA) elicited antibody responses compared to wild type immunogens. Here we determined the structural features and antigenic profiles of H3 COBRA HA proteins. Two H3 COBRA HA proteins, TJ5 and J4, are better recognized by pre-existing B cells and monoclonal antibodies from the 2017-2018 vaccine season compared to COBRA NG2 and a wild type A/Hong Kong/2014 HA protein. We determined a cryo-EM structure of one mAb that poorly recognizes NG2, mAb TJ5-5, in complex with the TJ5 COBRA HA protein and identified residues critical to mAb recognition. As NG2 is more effective than TJ5 for a recent Hong Kong/2019 virus, these data provide insights into the diminished effectiveness of influenza vaccines across vaccine seasons.",

    "abstract": "Cryptosporidium spp. is the most important foodborne and waterborne pathogens and the leading cause of mortality from foodborne and waterborne gastrointestinal disease. In neonates of domestic animals it is associated with consistent diarrhoea and dehydration. Cryptosporidium infection begins with the ingestion of sporulated oocytes disseminated by carrier animals that consistently contaminate the environment. Many diagnostic tests are available including microscopy, antigen trap ELISA, but none of the diagnostic tests available currently cannot differentiate between active and passive infection in the host. In the current study, to address this challenge an mRNA based duplex TaqMan(R) probe PCR (dRT-qPCR) was developed to target the Cryptosporidium oocyst wall protein (COWP) gene and 18ssu rRNA gene in a single tube that can detect metabolically active Cryptosporidial oocysts. The mRNA transcripts are the direct indicator of any actively replicating cell and it will help decipher the active stages of its lifecycle in host. This diagnostic assay was standardized by computing transcript copy number-based limit of detection. For COWP and 188ssu rRNA genes the limit of detection was 7.08x1004 and 5.95x1005 respectively. During active infections the oocyst wall protein will be active and so its COWP gene transcripts will act as marker for active infection. While transcripts for 18SSU rRNA are constitutively expressing in Cryptosporidial life cycle. This current diagnostic assay will be a quantitative marker that will help assess active stages of Cryptosporidium infection in neonates. The disease dynamics will help better understand to formulate the control strategies and contain infection among the healthy animals.\n\nImportanceCryptosporidiosis is an important neonatal disease affecting goats causing diarrhoea, dehydration and stunted growth. For diagnosing this condition, many diagnostic tests are available including microscopy, immunological tests, but none of the diagnostic tests available currently can differentiate between active and passive infection in the host. The mRNA transcripts are the direct indicator of any actively replicating cell and especially in intracellular parasites it will help decipher the infective stages of a lifecycle in the host, and hence the test was developed in a reverse transcriptional format in a duplex mode. The currently developed diagnostic assay for cryptosporidiosis was evaluated for sensitivity using Limit of detection (LOD). This diagnostic test will act as a quantitative marker to aid in detecting active stages of Cryptosporidium infection in neonatal goats and will eventually lead to better control strategies for managing cryptosporidial infections in the future.",

Here, we model and map the environmental habitats of copepod (i.e. the main component of marine zooplankton) FGs to identify regions sharing similar functional trait expression, at the community level.\n\nTaxonMarine planktonic Neocopepoda.\n\nLocationGlobal ocean.\n\nMethodsFactor analysis on mixed data and hierarchical clustering were used to identify copepod FGs based on five species-level functional traits. An ensemble of species distribution models was used to estimate the environmental niches of the species modelled and the community weighted mean values of the traits studied. Ocean regions were defined based on their community-level mean trait expression using a principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering.\n\nResultsEleven global copepod FGs were identified. They displayed contrasting latitudinal patterns in mean annual habitat suitability that could be explained by differences in environmental niche preferences: two FGs were associated with polar conditions, one followed the global temperature gradient, five were associated with tropical oligotrophic gyres, and the remaining three with boundary currents and counter currents. Four main regions of varying community weighted mean trait values emerged: the Southern Ocean, the northern and southern high latitudes, the tropical gyres, and the boundary currents and upwelling systems.\n\nConclusionsThe present FGs will improve the representation of copepods in global marine ecosystem models. This study improves the understanding of the patterns and drivers of copepods trait biogeography and will serve as a basis for studying links between zooplankton biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in a context of climate change.",

    "abstract": "Tropical fish are fast-growing and high energetic-demand organisms, which can be highly vulnerable to long-lasting effects of heat stress and pollution, particularly under food shortages. We tested this by assessing highly complex direct and delayed interactive effects of an extreme temperature (32{degrees}C) from a simulated marine heatwave (MHW), copper (Cu, 0, 100, 150 and 175 {micro}g L-1) and food availability (limited and saturated food) on larvae of a tropical, reef-associated seaperch (Psammoperca waigiensis). Cu, MHW, and food limitation independently reduced survival and growth, partly explained by reduced feeding. The negative effect of Cu on fish survival was more substantial under MHW, particularly under limited food. Delayed interactive effects of Cu, MHW, and food limitation were still lethal to fish larvae during the post-exposure period. These results indicate that reef-associated fish larvae are highly vulnerable to these dominant stressors, impairing their ecological function as predators in the coral reefs.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=101 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/481600v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc37aborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eaedaeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a409eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1087cc6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The past decades have witnessed efforts to unveil ecological risks associated with massive releases of captive-bred individuals (\"stock enhancement\"). Still, we may underestimate the negative impact because current schemes rarely consider the consequences of stock enhancement for the whole ecological community. Here, we use theory and long-term data of Japanese stream fish communities to show that stock enhancement undermines community stability. Our theory predicted that stock enhancement destabilizes community dynamics by facilitating competitive exclusion. Consistent with this prediction, fish communities showed greater temporal fluctuations and fewer species richness in rivers with the intensive stocking of hatchery masu salmon - a major freshwater resource in the region. Our findings paint a bleak picture for stock enhancement, reinforcing the recurrent calls for alternative management strategies.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryLarge-scale releases of captive-bred organisms undermine the long-term persistence of ecological communities by disrupting the stable coexistence of competing species.",

    "abstract": "Elucidating the Transcription Factors (TFs) that drive the gene expression changes in a given experiment is one of the most common questions asked by researchers. The existing methods rely on the predicted Transcription Factor Binding Site (TFBS) to model the changes in the motif activity. Such methods only work for TFs that have a motif and assume the TF binding profile is the same in all cell types. Given the wealth of the ChIP-seq data available for a wide range of the TFs in various cell types, we propose that the modeling can be done using ChiP-seq \"signatures\" directly, effectively skipping the motif finding and TFBS prediction steps. We present xcore, an R package that allows Transcription Factor activity modeling based on their ChiP-seq signatures and users gene expression data. We also provide xcoredata a companion data package that provides a collection of preprocessed ChiP-seq signatures. We demonstrate that xcore leads to biologically relevant predictions using TGF-beta induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition and rinderpest infection time-course CAGE data as examples.\n\nAvailability and Implementationxcore and xcoredata R packages are freely available at www.github.com/bkaczkowski/xcore and www.github.com/mcjmigdal/xcoredata.\n\nxcore user guide is available www.bkaczkowski.github.io/xcore/articles/xcore_vignette.html.\n\nContactb.kaczkowski@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "Transition path ensemble is of special interest in reaction coordinate identification as it consists of reactive trajectories that start from the reactant state and end in the product one. As a theoretical framework for describing the transition path ensemble, the transition path theory has been introduced more than ten years ago and so far its applications have been only illustrated in several low-dimensional systems. Given the transition path ensemble, expressions for calculating flux, current (a vector field), and principal curve are derived here in the space of collective variables from the transition path theory and they are applicable to time-series obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of high-dimensional systems, i.e., the position coordinates as a function of time in the transition path ensemble. The connection of the transition path theory is made to a density-weighted average flux, a quantity proposed in a previous work to appraise the relevance of a coordinate to the reaction coordinate [W. Li, J. Chem. Phys. 156, 054117 (2022)]. Most importantly, as an extension of the existing quantities, time-lagged quantities such as flux and current are also proposed. The main insights and objects provided by these time-lagged quantities are illustrated in the application to the alanine peptide in vacuum.",

    "abstract": "Background & AimsVinyl chloride (VC) monomer is a volatile organic compound commonly used in industry to produce polyvinyl chloride (PVC). At high exposure levels, VC causes liver cancer and toxicant-associated steatohepatitis. However, lower exposure levels (i.e., < regulatory exposure limits) that do not directly damage the liver, enhance injury caused by Western diet (WD). Although these lower exposure levels are considered  safe, it is unknown if the long-term impact of transient low-concentration VC enhances the risk of liver cancer development. Low-concentration VC is especially a concern given that fatty liver disease is in and of itself a risk factor for the development of liver cancer.\n\nMethodsC57Bl/6J mice were fed WD or control diet (CD) for 1 year. During the first 12 weeks of feeding only, mice were also exposed to VC via inhalation at sub-regulatory limit concentrations (<1 ppm) or air for 6 hours/day, 5 days/week.\n\nResultsFeeding WD for 1 year caused significant hepatic injury, including steatohepatitis and moderate fibrosis, which was exacerbated by VC. Additionally, VC increased the number of tumors which ranged from moderately to poorly differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transcriptomic analysis demonstrated VC-induced changes in metabolic but also ribosomal processes. Epitranscriptomic analysis showed a VC-induced shift of the modification pattern that has been associated with metabolic disease, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cancer.\n\nConclusionsThese data indicate that VC sensitizes the liver to other stressors (e.g., WD), resulting in enhanced tumorigenesis. These data raise concerns about a potential interaction between VC exposure and WD. Furthermore, it also emphasizes that current safety restrictions may be insufficient to account for other factors that can influence hepatotoxicity.",

    "abstract": "The success and failure of past cultures across the Arctic was tightly coupled to the ability of past people to exploit the full range of resources available to them, and to adapt to fluctuations in resource availability. There is substantial evidence for the hunting of birds, caribou and a wide range of marine mammals in pre-historic Greenland from bone remains preserved in ancient middens. However, the extent to which these communities relied on marine resources such as fish and large cetaceans is understudied because of the taphonomic processes and bias that affect how these taxa present themselves in the archaeological record. To address this, we analyse DNA from bulk bone samples from 12 archaeological sites across Greenland dating from Paleo-Inuit to Neo-Inuit periods. Using a combination of metabarcoding and shotgun metagenomics we identify an assemblage of 43 species consisting of birds, fish, and both marine and terrestrial mammals. We find genetic evidence of five different whale species, of which the bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) was the most commonly detected. Furthermore, we detect nine fish species, of which four have not previously been identified in any of the studied sites. Lastly, we identify a novel haplotype in caribou (Rangifer tarandus) at the 3,000-year-old site Itinnera, suggesting the presence of a distinct lineage of (now extinct) dwarfed caribou that colonised Greenland after the last ice age 9,000 years ago. Collectively, these findings provide a rare insight into whaling and fishing practices in Greenland and demonstrate that prehistoric Greenlandic communities had the social and technological capacity to target the largest whales available in the waters around them.",

With the growing number and scale of neuroimaging data sharing initiatives of both healthy and clinical populations comes an opportunity to create large and heterogeneous sets of dynamic network models to better understand individual differences in network dynamics and their impact on brain health. Here we present TheVirtualBrain-UK Biobank pipeline, a robust, automated and open-source brain image processing solution to address the expanding scope of TheVirtualBrain project. Our pipeline generates connectome-based modelling inputs compatible for use with TheVirtualBrain. We leverage the existing multimodal MRI processing pipeline from the UK Biobank made for use with a variety of brain imaging modalities. We add various features and changes to the original UK Biobank implementation specifically for informing large-scale network models, including user-defined parcellations for the construction of matching whole-brain functional and structural connectomes. Changes also include detailed reports for quality control of all modalities, a streamlined installation process, modular software packaging, updated software versions, and support for various publicly available datasets. The pipeline has been tested on both healthy and clinical populations and is robust to the morphological changes observed in aging and dementia. In this paper, we describe these and other pipeline additions and modifications in detail, as well as how this pipeline fits into the TheVirtualBrain ecosystem.",

    "abstract": "The human visual system exploits continuity in the visual environment, which induces two contrasting perceptual phenomena: repulsive aftereffects and attractive serial dependences. Recent studies have theorized that these two effects concurrently arise in perceptual processing, but empirical evidence that directly supports this hypothesis lacks. Here we show that the two effects concurrently modulate estimation behavior in a typical sequence of perceptual tasks. We first demonstrate that observers estimation error as a function of both the previous stimulus and response cannot be fully described by either attractive or repulsive bias but is instead well captured by a summation of repulsion from the previous stimulus and attraction toward the previous response. We then reveal that the repulsive bias is centered on the observers sensory encoding of the previous stimulus, which is again repelled away from the preceding trials, whereas the attractive bias is centered precisely on the previous response, which is the observers best prediction about the incoming stimuli. Our findings provide strong evidence that sensory coding is shaped by dynamic tuning of the system to the past stimuli, inducing repulsive aftereffects, and followed by inference incorporating the prediction from the past estimation, leading to attractive serial dependence.",

    "abstract": "Challenging the brain with experiential richness creates tissue-level changes and synaptic plasticity, but the interjacent network level has not been accessible. We here show that environmental enrichment has unexpectedly far-reaching effects on network connectivity and multi-dimensional coding in the hippocampus. We present direct evidence that experience impacts local and global network connectivity, synchrony, and rhythmic dynamics. For this, we investigated the hippocampi from standard-housed mice (SD) and mice living in an enriched environment (ENR) using large-scale ex vivo recordings with a high-density microelectrode sensing array that - with the unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution-allowed simultaneous electrophysiological assessment across the entire circuit. In the absence of extrinsic electrical network stimulation, we found enhanced functional connectivity and high-dimensional coding in hippocampal-cortical networks of ENR mice. The mapped connectome illustrated a scale-free smallworld topology and an ENR-induced resilience to random failures. ENR enhanced large-scale spatiotemporal firing patterns, which facilitated efficient pattern separation and boosted the information encoded in the firing phases of slow oscillatory rhythms. Given that essentially all electrophysiological studies on network behaviors have been done on animals housed in stimulus-poor conditions, our SD mice showed the expected normal functionality. The literature consequently underestimates the extent of spontaneous network activity and connectivity under truly physiological conditions. Our results pave the way to unveil fundamental mechanisms of experience-dependent enhancement in the hippocampal network underlying high brain functions and provide markers for large-scale network remodeling and metaplasticity.",

    "abstract": "Aging is associated with auditory nerve (AN) functional deficits and decreased inhibition in the central auditory system, amplifying central responses in a process known as central gain. Although central gain enhances response amplitudes, central gain may not restore disrupted response timing. In this translational study, we measured responses from the AN and auditory midbrain in younger and older mice and humans. We hypothesized that older mice and humans exhibit central gain without an improvement in inter-trial synchrony in the midbrain. Our data demonstrated greater age-related deficits in AN response amplitudes than auditory midbrain response amplitudes, as shown by significant interactions between neural generator and age group, indicating central gain in auditory midbrain. However, synchrony decreases with age in both the AN and midbrain responses. These results reveal age-related central gain without concomitant improvements in synchrony, consistent with those predictions based on decreases in inhibition. Persistent decreases in synchrony may contribute to auditory processing deficits in older mice and humans.",

Optogenetic stimulation of VGATIN and PVIN in the somatosensory cortex triggered astrocytic Ca2+ increases that were abolished by anaesthesia. PVIN evoked astrocytic Ca2+ responses with a short latency that preceded NVC, whereas VGATIN evoked Ca2+ increases that were delayed relative to the NVC response. The early onset in PVIN evoked Ca2+ increases dependent on noradrenaline release from locus coeruleus, which also affected inhibitory NVC. Therefore, NVC mechanisms should be studied in awake mice and, though the relationship between interneuron activity and astrocytic Ca2+ is complex, we found a correlation between astrocyte activity and NVC in PVIN.",

    "abstract": "The thalamus is an important hub for sensory information and participates in sensory perception, regulation of attention, arousal and sleep. These functions are executed primarily by glutamatergic thalamocortical neurons that extend axons to the cortex and initiate cortico-thalamocortical connectional loops. However, the thalamus also contains projection GABAergic neurons that do not engage in direct communication with the cortex. Here, we have harnessed recent insight into the development of the intergeniculate (IGL), the ventrolateral geniculate (LGv) and the perihabenula (pHB) to specifically target and manipulate thalamic projection GABAergic neurons in female and male mice. Our results show that thalamic GABAergic neurons of the IGL and LGv receive retinal input from diverse classes of ipRGCs, but not from the M1 ipRGC type, while those in the pHB lack direct retinal input. We describe the synergistic role of the photoreceptor melanopsin and the thalamic neurons of the IGL/LGv in circadian entrainment to dim light. We identify a requirement for the thalamic IGL/LGv in the rapid changes in vigilance states associated with circadian light transitions. Furthermore, we map a previously undescribed thalamic network of developmentally related GABAergic neurons in the IGL/LGv complex and the pHB potentially involved in light-dependent mood regulation.\n\nSignificance statementThe intergeniculate leaflet and ventral geniculate nucleus are part of the extended circadian system and mediate some non-image-forming visual functions. Here we show that each of these structures has a thalamic (dorsal) as well as prethalamic (ventral) developmental origin. We map the retinal input to thalamus-derived cells in the IGL/LGv complex and discover that while ipRGC input is dominant, this is not likely to originate from M1-ipRGCs. We describe the extent of similarity in synaptic input to developmentally related cells in the IGL/LGv and in the perihabenula nucleus (pHB). We implicate thalamic cells in the IGL/LGv in vigilance state transitions at circadian light changes and in overt behavioural entrainment to dim light, the latter exacerbated by concomitant loss of melanopsin expression.",

    "abstract": "Producing context-specific motor acts requires sensorimotor neural networks to integrate multiple sensory modalities. Some of this integration occurs via presynaptic interactions between proprioceptive afferent neurons themselves,1,2 other by afferents of different modalities targeting appropriate motor neurons (MNs).3-5 How the interneuronal network typically interposed between sensory afferents and MNs contributes to this integration, particularly at single-neuron resolution, is much less understood. In stick insects, this network contains nonspiking interneurons (NSIs) converging onto the posture-controlling slow extensor tibiae motor neuron (SETi). We analyzed how load altered movement signal processing by tracing the interaction of movement (femoral chordotonal organ, fCO) and load (tibial campaniform sensilla, tiCS) signals from the afferents through the NSI network to the motor output. On the afferent level, load reduced movement signal gain by presynaptic inhibition; tiCS stimulation elicited primary afferent depolarization and reduced fCO afferent action potential amplitude. In the NSI network, graded responses to movement and load inputs summed nonlinearly and increased the gain of NSIs opposing movement-induced reflexes. The gain of SETi and muscle movement reflex responses consequently decreased. Gain modulation was movement parameter-specific and required presynaptic inhibition; pharmacologically blocking presynaptic inhibition abolished load-dependent tuning of SETi responses. These data describe sensorimotor gain control at the sensory, premotor, and motor levels. Presynaptic inhibition-mediated nonlinear integration allowed the NSI network to respond to movement sensory input in a context (load)-dependent manner. These findings show how gain changes can allow premotor networks to integrate multiple sensory modalities and thus generate context-appropriate motor activity.",

    "abstract": "In multi-echo fMRI (ME-fMRI), two metrics have been widely used to measure the performance of various acquisition and analysis approaches. These are temporal SNR (tSNR) and differential contrast-to-noise ratio (dCNR). A key step in ME-fMRI is the weighted combination of the data from multiple echoes, and prior work has examined the dependence of tSNR and dCNR on the choice of weights. However, most studies have focused on only one of these two metrics, and the relationship between the two metrics has not been examined. In this work, we present a geometric view that offers greater insight into the relation between the two metrics and their weight dependence. We identify three major regimes: (1) a tSNR robust regime in which tSNR is robust to the weight selection with most weight variants achieving close to optimal performance, whereas dCNR shows a pronounced dependence on the weights with most variants achieving suboptimal performance; (2) a dCNR robust regime in which dCNR is robust to the weight selection with most weight variants achieving close to optimal performance, while tSNR exhibits a strong dependence on the weights with most variants achieving significantly lower than optimal performance; and (3) a within-type robust regime in which both tSNR and dCNR achieve nearly optimal performance when the form of the weights are variants of their respective optimal weights and exhibit a moderate decrease in performance for other weight variants. Insight into the behavior observed in the different regimes is gained by considering spherical representations of the weight dependence of the components used to form each metric. For multi-echo acquisitions, dCNR is shown to be more directly related than tSNR to measures of CNR and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for both task-based and resting-state fMRI scans, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Despite detailed characterization of fascicular organization of somatic nerves, the functional anatomy of fascicles evident in human and large mammal cervical vagus nerve is unknown. The vagus nerve is a prime target for intervention in the field of electroceuticals due to its extensive distribution to the heart, larynx, lungs, and abdominal viscera. However, current practice of the approved vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) technique is to stimulate the entire nerve. This produces indiscriminate stimulation of non-targeted effectors and undesired side effects. Selective neuromodulation is now a possibility with a spatially-selective vagal nerve cuff. However, this requires the knowledge of the fascicular organization at the level of cuff placement to inform selectivity of only the desired target organ or function. We imaged function over milliseconds with fast neural electrical impedance tomography and selective stimulation, and found consistent spatially separated regions within the nerve correlating with the three fascicular groups of interest, suggesting organotopy. This was independently verified with structural imaging by tracing anatomical connections from the end organ with microCT and the development of an anatomical map of the vagus nerve. This confirmed organotopic organization. Here we show, for the first time, localized fascicles in the porcine cervical vagus nerve which map to cardiac, pulmonary and recurrent laryngeal function (N=4). These findings pave the way for improved outcomes in VNS as unwanted side effects could be reduced by targeted selective stimulation of identified organ-specific fascicles and the extension of this technique clinically beyond the currently approved disorders to treat heart failure, chronic inflammatory disorders and more.",

    "abstract": "Excessive alcohol (ethanol) consumption, such as binge-drinking, is extremely commonplace and represents a major health concern. Through modeling excessive drinking in rodents, we are beginning to uncover the neurobiological and neurobehavioral causes and consequences of this pattern of ethanol intake. One important factor for modeling binge drinking in mice is that subjects reliably drink to blood ethanol concentrations (BECs) of 80 mg/dl or higher. Drinking-in-the-dark (DID) is a commonly used mouse model of binge drinking, and we have shown these methods reliably result in robust ethanol front-loading and binge-level BECs in C57BL/6J (B6) mice as well as other ethanol-preferring mouse strains/lines. However, establishing the DID model in a new vivarium space forced us to consider the use of rodent diet formulations we had not previously used. The current set of experiments were designed to investigate the role of two standard rodent diet formulations on binge drinking and the development of ethanol front-loading using DID. We found that BECs in animals maintained on LabDiet 5001 (LD01) were double those found in mice maintained on Teklad 2920x (TL20). Interestingly, this effect was paralleled by differences in the degree of front-loading, such that LD01-fed mice consumed approximately twice as much ethanol in the first 15 minutes of the 2-hour DID sessions compared to TL20-fed mice. Surprisingly however, mice that developed front-loading during maintenance on the LD01 diet continued to display front-loading behavior after being switched to the TL20 diet. These data emphasize the importance of choosing and reporting diet formulations when conducting voluntary drinking studies and support the need for further investigation into the mechanisms behind diet-induced differences in binge drinking, particularly front-loading.",

Preprocessed, analysis-ready data was made openly available. Data quality plays a key role in the analysis of dMRI, and we provide automated quality control (QC) scores for every scan, as part of the data release. To scale QC to this large dataset, we trained a neural network through the combination of a small data subset scored by experts and a larger set scored by community scientists. The network performs QC highly concordant with that of experts on a held out set (ROC-AUC = 0.947). A further analysis of the neural network demonstrates that it relies on image features with relevance to QC.

    "abstract": "During immune surveillance, CD8 T cells scan the surface of antigen presenting cells using dynamic microvillar palpation and movements as well as by having their receptors pre-concentrated into patches. Here, we use real-time lattice light sheet microscopy to demonstrate the independence of microvillar and membrane receptor patch scanning. While T cell receptor (TCR) patches can distribute to microvilli, they do so stochastically and not preferentially as for other receptors such as CD62L. The distinctness of TCR patch movement from microvillar movement extends to many other receptors that form patches that also scan independently of the TCR. An exception to this is the CD8 co-receptor which largely co-migrates in patches that overlap with or are closely adjacent to those containing TCRs. Microvilli that assemble into a synapse contain various arrays of the engaged patches, notably of TCRs and the inhibitory receptor PD-1, creating a pastiche of occupancies that vary from microvillar contact to contact. In summary, this work demonstrates that localization of receptor patches within the membrane and on microvillar projections is stochastic prior to antigen detection and that such stochastic variation may play into the generation of many individually-composed receptor patch compositions at a single synapse.\n\nSignificance statementMotile T cell microvilli palpate surfaces to facilitate surface scanning in a pattern that is independent of the movement of pre-formed patches of transmembrane antigen-receptors across those microvilli; once T cell receptors engage, the microvilli act to scaffold multiple receptors within a microvillar close-contact.",

    "abstract": "Fruit aroma is an important organoleptic quality, which influences consumer preference and market competitiveness. Aroma compound synthesis pathways in plants have been widely identified of which the lipoxygenase pathway is crucial for fatty acid catabolism to form esters in apple. However, the regulatory mechanism of this pathway remains elusive. In this study, linear regression analysis and transgene verification revealed that the lipoxygenase MdLOX1a participates in ester biosynthesis. Yeast one-hybrid library screening indicated that a novel abiotic stress gene, MdASG1 (ABIOTIC STRESS GENE 1), was a positive regulator of the MdLOX1a promoter and ester production based on yeast one-hybrid and dual-luciferase assays, and correlation analysis among eight apple cultivars. Overexpression of MdASG1 in apple and tomato stimulated the lipoxygenase pathway and increased the fatty acid-derived volatile content, whereas the latter was decreased by MdASG1 silencing. Furthermore, MdASG1 overexpression enhanced the salt-stress tolerance of tomato and apple  Orin calli accompanied by a higher content of fatty acid-derived volatiles compared with that of non-stressed transgenic tomato fruit. Collectively, these findings indicate that MdASG1 activates MdLOX1a expression and participates in the lipoxygenase pathway, subsequently increasing the accumulation of aroma compounds especially under moderate salt stress treatment. The results also provide insight into the regulation of aroma production, and the potential strategy of prudent development and utilization of saline-alkali land to produce high-quality fruit, thereby reducing pressure on arable land and ensuring national food security.\n\nOne-sentence SummaryMdASG1 directly activates MdLOX1a expression to promote aroma volatiles accumulation especially under moderate salt stress.",

Although much is explored on the mechanisms that affect tipping points and alternative stable states, little is known on how ecosystems with alternative stable states could have emerged in the first place. Here, we explore whether evolution by natural selection can lead to the emergence of ecosystems with tipping points using a toy model inspired by shallow lakes. Shallow lakes are the best-known example where a shift from a submersed macrophyte dominated state to a floating macrophyte dominated state in response to excess nutrient loading corresponds to a tipping point between alternative stable states. We model the evolution of the macrophytes living depth in the lake, we identify the conditions under which the ancestor macrophyte population diversifies, and investigate whether alternate stable states dominated by different macrophyte phenotypes occur. Given the trade-off between access to light and nutrient along the water column, we show that asymmetry in competition for light is required for diversification, while alternative stable states require an additional mechanism, an unequal efficiency in nutrient removal. We find that eco-evolutionary dynamics may produce alternative stable states, but only under a restrictive range of conditions. Our analysis suggests that competitive asymmetries along opposing resource gradients may allow alternative stable states to emerge by natural selection.",

Here, we use a recently published machine learning framework to extract syllables from ten bird species ranging in their phylogenetic relatedness from 1 to 85 million years, to compare how phylogenetic relatedness influences accuracy. We also evaluate the utility of applying trained models to novel species. Our results indicate that model performance is best on conspecifics, with accuracy progressively decreasing as phylogenetic distance increases between taxa. However, we also find that the application of models trained on multiple distantly related species can improve the overall accuracy to levels near that of training and analyzing a model on the same species.

With the growing global population and the increasing impact of climate change on crop yield, there is an urgent need to apply genomic approaches to accelerate wheat breeding. With recent advances in DNA sequencing technology, a growing number of high-quality reference genomes are becoming available, reflecting the genetic content of a diverse range of cultivars. However, information on the presence or absence of genomic regions has been hard to visualize and interrogate due to the size of these genomes and the lack of suitable bioinformatics tools. To address this limitation, we have produced a wheat pangenome graph maintained within an online database to facilitate interrogation and comparison of wheat cultivar genomes. The database allows users to visualize regions of the pangenome to assess presence/absence variation between bread wheat genomes.\n\nDatabase URL: http://www.appliedbioinformatics.com.au/wheat_panache",

    "abstract": "PurposeDysmyelinating disorders lead to abnormalities in myelin structure that produce detectable effects in an echo-planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) signal. To estimate the voxel-wise proportion of myelin, data are typically fit to compartmental models in the time domain. This work characterizes limitations in these models by comparing high-resolution water spectra measured in postmortem fixed mouse brains to spectra predicted from time-domain models fit to the same data, specifically by comparing spectra from control and shiverer mice, a model for dysmyelination.\n\nMethodsPerfusion-fixed, resected control (n = 5) and shiverer (n = 4) mouse brains were imaged using 3D EPSI with 100 {micro}m isotropic resolution. The free induction decay (FID) was sampled every 2.74 ms over 192 echoes and Fourier transformed to produce water spectra with 1.9 Hz resolution. FIDs were also fit to two biophysical models and the resulting fits were converted to spectra with a Fourier transform. Spectral asymmetry was computed and compared before and after fitting the data to models.\n\nResultsSpectra derived from both models did not show the magnitude of asymmetric broadening observed in the raw data. Correlations between data- and model-derived asymmetries and estimated frequency shifts are weak, leading to a reduction in spectral sensitivity to changes in white-matter structure after fitting the data to models.\n\nConclusionThe results demonstrate spectral inconsistencies between biophysical model predictions and measured data, promoting the further incorporation of spectral analysis methods to develop and benchmark new model-based approaches.",

    "abstract": "Toxicity testing is under transformation as it aims to harness the potential of New Approach Methods (NAMs) as alternative test methods that may be less resource intensive (i.e., fewer animals, cheaper costs, quicker assays) than traditional approaches while also providing more data and information. While many stakeholders are of the opinion that this unfolding transformation holds significant promise as a more efficient and ethical way forward, few studies have compared the resources required for NAMs versus those needed for traditional animal-based toxicity tests, particularly in the field of ecotoxicology. The objective was to compare resources needed for traditional animal-based ecotoxicity tests versus alternative tests using emergent NAMs. From a bibliometric review, we estimate that traditional tests for a single chemical cost $118,000 USD, require 135 animals, and take 8 weeks. In comparison, alternative tests cost $2,600, require 20 animals (or none), and take up to 4 weeks to test 16 (to potentially hundreds of) chemicals. Based on our analysis we conclude that NAMs in ecotoxicology can be more advantageous than traditional methods in terms of resources required (i.e., monetary costs, number of animals needed, and testing times). We note, however, that the evidence underpinning these conclusions is relatively sparse. Moving forward, groups developing and applying NAMs should provide more detailed accounts of the resources required. In addition, there is also a need for carefully designed case studies that demonstrate the domain of applicability of NAMs (and make comparisons to traditional tests) to ultimately build confidence among the user community.",

    "abstract": "Classical genetic studies have identified many cases of pleiotropy where mutations in individual genes alter many different phenotypes. Quantitative genetic studies of natural genetic variants frequently examine one or a few traits, limiting their potential to identify pleiotropic effects of natural genetic variants. Widely adopted community association panels have been employed by plant genetics communities to study the genetic basis of naturally occurring phenotypic variation in a wide range of traits. High-density genetic marker data - 18M markers - from two partially overlapping maize association panels comprising 1,014 unique genotypes grown in field trials across at least seven US states and scored for 162 distinct trait datasets enabled the identification of of 2,154 suggestive marker-trait associations and 697 confident associations in the maize genome using a resampling-based genome-wide association strategy. The precision of individual marker-trait associations was estimated to be three genes based a reference set of genes with known phenotypes. Examples were observed of both genetic loci associated with variation in diverse traits (e.g. above-ground and below-ground traits), as well as individual loci associated with the same or similar traits across diverse environments. Many significant signals are located near genes whose functions were previously entirely unknown or estimated purely via functional data on homologs. This study demonstrates the potential of mining community association panel data using new higher density genetic marker sets combined with resampling-based genome-wide association tests to develop testable hypotheses about gene functions, identify potential pleiotropic effects of natural genetic variants, and study genotype by environment interaction.",

    "abstract": "Early-life adversity (ELA) predisposes individuals to develop neuropsychiatric conditions, which are more prevalent in women than men. Efforts to model this sex difference in rodents have produced mixed results, with some studies paradoxically showing stronger phenotypes in males than females. Since changes in reproductive hormone levels can increase the likelihood of anxiety disorders in women, we examined the effects of ELA on adult female mice across the estrous cycle. We found that during diestrus, when the ratio of progesterone to estrogen is relatively high, ELA mice exhibit increased avoidance behavior, altered activity levels in specific contexts, and increased theta oscillation power in the ventral hippocampus. Ovariectomy, which eliminates circulating estrogen but not progesterone, unexpectedly preserved some of the effects present in diestrus ELA mice. Progesterone receptor antagonism in diestrus normalized avoidance behavior in ELA mice, while treatment with a negative allosteric modulator of the progesterone metabolite allopregnanolone promoted avoidance behavior in control mice. These results suggest that altered progesterone and allopregnanolone signaling during diestrus increases avoidance behavior in ELA mice",

    "abstract": "Rabies viral vectors have become important components of the systems neuroscience toolkit, allowing both direct retrograde targeting of projection neurons and monosynaptic tracing of inputs to defined postsynaptic populations, but the rapid cytotoxicity of first-generation ({Delta}G) vectors limits their use to short-term experiments. We recently introduced second-generation, double-deletion-mutant ({Delta}GL) rabies viral vectors, showing that they efficiently retrogradely infect projection neurons and express recombinases effectively but with little to no detectable toxicity; more recently, we have shown that {Delta}GL viruses can be used for monosynaptic tracing with far lower cytotoxicity than the first-generation system. Here we introduce third-generation ({Delta}L) rabies viral vectors, which, like first-generation vectors, have only a single gene deleted from their genomes (in this case the viral polymerase gene L) but which appear to be as nontoxic as second-generation ones, based on in vivo longitudinal structural and functional two-photon imaging and ex vivo electrophysiology. Although third-generation vectors are therefore phenotypically very similar to second-generation ones, we show that they have the major advantage of growing to much higher titers, and this key difference results in significantly increased numbers of retrogradely labeled neurons in vivo. These {Delta}L rabies viral vectors therefore constitute a new state of the art for minimally perturbative, pathway-specific expression of recombinases and transactivators in mammalian neurons selected on the basis of their axonal projections. Because replication of deletion-mutant rabies viruses within complementing cells is precisely the process that underlies monosynaptic tracing, the higher replication efficiency of this new class of rabies viral vectors furthermore suggests the potential to provide the foundation of an improved nontoxic monosynaptic tracing system.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is the most common complication of diabetes, but the underlying molecular pathogenesis remains unclear. Accumulating evidence indicates that circular RNAs (circRNAs) play vital roles in DPN, while their expressions and functions in Schwann cell (SC) are rarely reported. Here, we performed protein profiling and circRNA sequencing on the peripheral nerves of patients with or without DPN. A total of 265 differentially expressed proteins were identified in DPN by protein profiling, which mainly enrich in myelination according to Gene Ontology analysis. Further, 15637 circRNAs were identified by circRNA sequencing, of which 11 were verified to be dysregulated. Among them, circ_0002538 was found to be downregulated in DPN and chosen for further investigation. Functional experiments revealed that circ_0002538 overexpression promoted SC migration and relieved demyelination in DPN. Mechanistic studies revealed that circ_0002538 could promote PLLP expression by sponging miR-138-5p, while lack of circ_0002538 led to PLLP deficiency, which further suppressed SC migration and caused demyelination. The present research provided novel insights into the pathogenesis of DPN, in which the circ_0002538/miR-138-5p/PLLP axis was suppressed in SCs and hence caused demyelination. These findings expanded the role of circRNAs in DPN and provided potential therapeutic targets for DPN.",

    "abstract": "The tremendous increase of video-based eye tracking has made it possible to collect data from thousands of participants. Traditional manual detection and classification procedures for saccades and trial categorization is not viable for the large data sets being collected. Additionally, high-speed video-based eye trackers now allow for the novel analysis of pupil responses and blink behavior. Here we present a detailed description of our pipeline for collecting data, storing data, organizing participant codes, and cleaning data, which are fairly lab-specific but nonetheless important precursory steps in establishing standardized pipelines. More importantly, we also include descriptions of the automated detection and classification of saccades, blinks,  blincades (blinks occurring during saccades), and boomerang saccades (two saccades in opposite directions that occur almost simultaneously so that speed-based algorithms fail to split them), which are almost entirely task-agnostic and can be used on a wide variety of data. We additionally describe novel findings about post-saccadic oscillations, and provide a method to get more accurate estimates for end-points of saccades. Lastly, we describe the automated behavior classification for the Interleaved Pro- and Anti-Saccade Task (IPAST), a well-known task that probes voluntary and inhibitory control. This pipeline was evaluated using data collected from 592 human participants between 5 and 93 years of age, making it robust enough to handle large clinical patient data sets as well. In sum, this pipeline has been optimized to consistently handle large data sets obtained from diverse study cohorts (i.e., development, aging, clinical), and collected across multiple laboratory sites.",

    "abstract": "HIV establishes a persistent infection in heterogeneous cell reservoirs, which can be maintained by different mechanisms including cellular proliferation, and represent the main obstacle to curing the infection. The expression of the Fc{gamma} receptor CD32 has been identified as a marker of the active cell reservoirs in people on antiretroviral therapy, but if its expression has any role in conferring advantage for viral persistence is unknown. Here, we report that HIV-infected cells expressing CD32 have reduced susceptibility to natural killer (NK) antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) by a mechanism compatible with the suboptimal binding of HIV-specific antibodies. Infected CD32 cells have increased proliferative capacity in the presence of immune complexes, and are more resistant to strategies directed to potentiate NK function. Remarkably, reactivation of the latent reservoir from antiretroviral-treated people living with HIV increases the pool of infected CD32 cells, which are largely resistant to the ADCC immune mechanism. Thus, we report the existence of reservoir cells that evade part of the NK immune response through the expression of CD32.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

The varying prevalence of antibiotic resistance across N. gonorrhoeae lineages5 suggests that underlying metabolic differences may influence the likelihood of acquisition of specific resistance mutations6,7. We hypothesized that the requirement for supplemental CO2, present in approximately half of isolates8, reflects one such example of metabolic variation. Here, using a genome-wide association study and experimental investigations, we show that CO2-dependence is attributable to a single substitution in a {beta}-carbonic anhydrase, canB. CanB19E is necessary and sufficient for growth in the absence of CO2, and the hypomorphic CanB19G variant confers CO2-dependence. Furthermore, ciprofloxacin resistance is correlated with CanB19G in clinical isolates, and the presence of CanB19G increases the likelihood of acquisition of ciprofloxacin resistance. Together, our results suggest that metabolic variation has impacted the acquisition of fluoroquinolone resistance.",

The current work aimed to develop an iPSC organoid model enriched with stable NKX2-1+ BTP-like cells. Building on prior work, we optimized a directed differentiation paradigm to generate spheroids with robust NKX2-1 expression. Spheroids were expanded into organoids that possessed NKX2-1+/CPM+ BTP-like cells, which increased in number over time. Single cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed a high degree of transcriptional similarity between induced BTPs (iBTPs) and in vivo BTPs. Using FACS, iBTPs can be purified and expanded as induced bud tip organoids (iBTO), which maintain an enriched population of bud tip progenitors. When iBTOs are directed to differentiate into airway or alveolar cell types using well-established methods, they give rise to organoids composed of organized airway or alveolar epithelium, respectively. Collectively, iBTOs are transcriptionally and functionally similar to in vivo BTPs, providing an important model to study human lung development and differentiation.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTiPSC-derived lung bud tip progenitors emerge in organoid culture, can be isolated and expanded, are transcriptionally similar to primary bud tip progenitors, and can differentiate into airway or alveolar organoids.",

In many countries, considerable resources are spent combatting scrub encroachment. Here, we hypothesize that encroachment may benefit biodiversity - especially under eutrophic conditions where asymmetric competition among plants compromises conservation targets.\n\nWe studied the effects of scrub cover, nutrient levels and soil moisture on richness of vascular plants, bryophytes, soil fungi and microbes in open and overgrown wetlands. We also tested the effect of encroachment, eutrophication and soil moisture on indicators of conservation value (red-listed species, indicator species and uniqueness).\n\nPlant and bryophyte species richness peaked at low soil fertility, whereas soil fertility promoted soil microbes. Soil fungi responded negatively to increasing soil moisture. Lidar-derived variables reflecting degree of scrub cover had predominantly positive effects on species richness measures.\n\nConservation value indicators had a negative relationship to soil fertility and a positive to encroachment. For plant indicator species, the negative effect of high nutrient levels was offset by encroachment, supporting our hypothesis of competitive release under shade. The positive effect of soil moisture on indicator species was strong in open habitats only.\n\nNutrient poor mires and meadows host many rare species and require conservation management by grazing and natural hydrology. On former arable lands, where restoration of infertile conditions is unfeasible, we recommend rewilding with opportunities for encroachment towards semi-open willow scrub and swamp forest, with the prospect of high species richness in bryophytes, fungi and soil microbes and competitive release in the herb layer.",

Our aim was to study the breeding phenology and reproductive success associated with the use of those two seasonal niches to understand how this breeding strategy can be maintained. Field surveys revealed that breeding phenology was typically bimodal with a higher breeding effort in autumn. More importantly, in spring, the survival rate of offspring was severely reduced by the presence of autumn tadpoles, indicating a clear priority effect. However, the autumn cohort often failed to survive over winter, in which case spring cohorts were often successful. Based on those results, we constructed a model in which females can allocate a variable portion of eggs to each season and added a priority effect. We conclude that the existence of the two breeding seasons may indeed constitute a bet-hedging strategy.",

More than 69% of both genomes are composed of repeats, with retrotransposons the most abundant. We identify 1,150 orthogroups which are unique to caecilians and enriched for functions in olfaction and detection of chemical signals. There are 379 orthogroups with signatures of positive selection on caecilian lineages with roles in organ development and morphogenesis, sensory perception and immunity amongst others. We discover that caecilian genomes are missing the ZRS enhancer of Sonic Hedgehog which is also mutated in snakes. In vivo deletions have shown ZRS is required for limb development in mice, thus revealing a shared molecular target implicated in the independent evolution of limblessness in snakes and caecilians.",

    "abstract": "Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) emerged early in evolution and occur in all domains of life and nearly in all species, including humans. Mutations in four sHSPs (HspB1, HspB3, HspB5, HspB8) are associated with neuromuscular disorders. The aim of this study is to investigate the evolutionary forces shaping these sHSPs during vertebrate evolution. We performed comparative evolutionary analyses on a set of orthologous sHSP sequences, based on the ratio of non-synonymous: synonymous substitution rates for each codon. We found that these sHSPs had been historically exposed to different degrees of purifying selection, decreasing in this order: HspB8 > HspB1, HspB5 > HspB3. Within each sHSP, regions with different degrees of purifying selection can be discerned, resulting in characteristic selective pressure profiles. The conserved -crystallin domains were exposed to the most stringent purifying selection compared to the flanking regions, supporting a  dimorphic pattern of evolution. Thus, during vertebrate evolution the different sequence partitions were exposed to different and measurable degrees of selective pressures. Among the disease-associated mutations, most are missense mutations primarily in HspB1 and to a minor extent in the other sHSPs. Our data provide an explanation for this disparate incidence. Contrary to the expectation, most missense mutations cause dominant disease phenotypes. Theoretical considerations support a connection between the historic exposure of these sHSP genes to a high degree of purifying selection and the unusual prevalence of genetic dominance of the associated disease phenotypes. Our study puts the genetics of inheritable sHSP-borne diseases into the context of vertebrate evolution.",

    "abstract": "Chromatin accessibility assays are central to the genome-wide identification of gene regulatory elements associated with transcriptional regulation. However, the data have highly variable quality arising from several biological and technical factors. To surmount this problem, we use the predictability of open-chromatin peaks from DNA sequence-based machine-learning models to evaluate and refine chromatin accessibility data. Our framework, gapped k-mer SVM quality check (gkmQC), provides the quality metrics for a sample based on the prediction accuracy of the trained models. We tested 886 samples with DNase-seq from the ENCODE/Roadmap projects to demonstrate that gkmQC can effectively identify high-quality samples underperforming owing to marginal read depths. Peaks identified in high-quality samples by gkmQC are more accurately aligned at functional regulatory elements, show greater enrichment of regulatory elements harboring functional variants from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), and explain greater heritability of phenotypes from their relevant tissues. Moreover, gkmQC can optimize the peak-calling threshold to identify additional peaks, especially for single-cell chromatin accessibility data as well as bulk data. Here we provide a standalone open-source toolkit (https://github.com/Dongwon-Lee/gkmQC) for such analyses and share improved regulatory maps using gkmQC.

    "abstract": "Iron dyshomeostasis contributes to aging, but little information is available about the molecular mechanisms. Here, we provide evidence that, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, aging is associated with altered expression of genes involved in iron homeostasis. We further demonstrate that defects in the conserved mRNA-binding protein Cth2, which controls stability and translation of mRNAs encoding iron-containing proteins, increase lifespan by alleviating its repressive effects on mitochondrial function. Mutation of the conserved cysteine residue in Cth2 that inhibits its RNA-binding activity is sufficient to confer longevity, whereas Cth2 gain-of-function shortens replicative lifespan. Consistent with its function in RNA degradation, we demonstrate that Cth2 deficiency relieves Cth2-mediated post-transcriptional repression of nuclear-encoded components of the electron transport chain. Our findings uncover a major role of the RNA-binding protein Cth2 in the regulation of lifespan and suggest that modulation of iron starvation signaling can serve as a target for potential aging interventions.",

    "abstract": "The TREX1 3 [-&gt;] 5 exonuclease degrades DNA in vivo to prevent chronic immune activation through the cGAS-STING pathway. TREX1 degrades ss- and dsDNA containing a free 3-hydroxyl, but the precise nature of immune-activating DNA remains an open question. The TREX1 homodimer structure is critical for exonuclease activity with amino acids from one protomer acting across the dimer interface contributing to catalysis in the opposing protomer. The unique TREX1 obligate homodimer structure suggests an intricate connection between the TREX1 protomers that has yet to be explained. We used biochemical assays, molecular dynamics simulations, and kinetic modeling to determine relative TREX1 affinities for ss- and dsDNA and to interrogate inter-protomer communication within the TREX1 homodimer. These new findings indicate that TREX1 is a semi-processive exonuclease with at least a 20-fold greater affinity for dsDNA than for ssDNA. Furthermore, we find extensively correlated dynamics between TREX1 protomers revealing newly identified substrate interactions in the TREX1 enzyme. These data indicate that TREX1 has evolved as a semi-processive exonuclease with a likely in vivo function to degrade dsDNA, where the TREX1 homodimer structure facilitates a mechanism for efficient binding and catabolism of dsDNA. These studies identify previously unrecognized regions of the TREX1 enzyme involved in DNA interactions, and our findings contribute to an emerging model of TREX1 exonuclease activity.",

    "abstract": "Multiheme cytochromes play key roles in diverse biogeochemical cycles, but understanding the origin and evolution of these proteins is a challenge due to their ancient origin and complex structure. Up until now, the evolution of multiheme cytochromes composed by multiple redox modules in a single polypeptide chain was proposed to occur by gene fusion events. In this context, the pentaheme nitrite reductase NrfA and the tetraheme cytochrome c554 were previously proposed to be at the origin of the extant octa- and nonaheme cytochromes c involved in metabolic pathways that contribute to the nitrogen, sulfur and iron biogeochemical cycles by a gene fusion event. Here, we combine structural and character-based phylogenetic analysis with an unbiased root placement method to refine the evolutionary relationships between these multiheme cytochromes. The evidence show that NrfA and cytochrome c554 belong to different clades, which suggests that these two multiheme cytochromes are products of truncation of ancestral octaheme cytochromes related to extant ONR and MccA, respectively. From our phylogenetic analysis, the last common ancestor is predicted to be an octaheme cytochrome with nitrite reduction ability. Evolution from this octaheme framework led to the great diversity of extant multiheme cytochromes analised here by pruning and grafting of protein modules and hemes. By shedding light into the evolution of multiheme cytochromes that intervene in different biogeochemical cycles, this work contributes to our understanding about the interplay between biology and geochemistry across large time scales in the history of Earth.",

    "abstract": "Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) constitute a group of human malignancies that originate from the squamous epithelium. Most SCC patients experience treatment failure and relapse and have a poor prognosis due to de novo and acquired resistance to first-line chemotherapeutic agents. To identify chemoresistance mechanisms and explore novel chemosensitizer targets, we performed whole-transcriptome sequencing of paired resistant/parental SCC cells. We identified DLGAP1 antisense RNA 2 (D-AS2) as a crucial noncoding RNA that contributes to chemoresistance in SCC. Mechanistically, D-AS2 associates with histones to regulate the distal elements of FAM3 metabolism regulating signaling molecule D (FAM3D) and reduces extracellular FAM3D protein secretion. FAM3D interacts with Gi-coupled G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) formyl peptide receptor (FPR) 1 and FPR2 to suppress phospholipase D (PLD) activity; thus, reduced FAM3D activates PLD signaling. Moreover, activated PLD promotes phosphatidic acid (PA) production and subsequent yes-associated protein (YAP) nuclear translocation. Accordingly, in vivo administration of a D-AS2-targeting antisense oligonucleotide sensitizes SCC to cisplatin treatment. In summary, our study reveals that D-AS2/FAM3D-mediated PLD/PA lipid signaling is essential in SCC chemoresistance and that D-AS2 can be targeted to sensitize SCC to cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents.\n\nSignificanceThis study identifies D-AS2 as a targetable lipid-related lncRNA that activates YAP signaling via PLD/PA axis to trigger chemoresistance in SCC.",

    "abstract": "Proteins comprise a multibillion-dollar industry in enzymes and therapeutics, but bacterial protein production can be costly and inefficient. Proteins of interest (POIs) must be extracted from lysed cells, purified, and resolubilized. The Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 type III secretion system (T3SS) is a protein secretion complex in Salmonella that has been engineered to secrete heterologous proteins and addresses the problems associated with bacterial protein production. However, the current best practices method of T3SS pathway activation for secretion is not ideal for industrial scaleup. Previously, the T3SS was activated by plasmid-based overexpression of the T3SS transcriptional regulator, hilA, which requires the addition of a small molecule inducer to the culture media and adds significant cost to the production media. Plasmid-based expression is also subject to instability in large-scale fermentation. Here, we show that we can constitutively activate the T3SS by modulating the upstream transcriptional regulator, hilD, either through knocking out hilE, a repressor of HilD, or by adding transcriptional fusions to hilD. Finally, we combine the two most promising genomic modifications to build a constitutively active T3SS capable of secreting a range of heterologous proteins at titers comparable to those reported with synthetic induction of hilA. These improvements further our goal of making an industrially competitive protein production strain that reduces the challenges associated with plasmid induction and maintenance.\n\nImportanceProteins are used in our everyday lives as therapeutics (insulin), industrial enzymes (laundry detergent), and bio-based materials (spider silk). Current industrial protein production in bacteria is costly because it requires purification of the target protein from the other proteins inside the cell. We solve this problem by engineering the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 type III secretion system (T3SS) to export the target protein into the cell growth media. This makes the protein purification process more efficient and cheaper. However, this system currently requires an expensive inducer reagent to activate it which significantly increases the cost of the production media. We show here the creation of a constitutively active T3SS, meaning the T3SS pathway is always on. In doing so, we successfully created a Salmonella strain that eliminates the need for the inducer reagent and exports proteins at levels comparable to the inducer-activated system, ultimately reducing the cost of T3SS protein production.",

    "abstract": "In July 2016, a severe coral reef invertebrate mortality event occurred approximately 200km southeast of Galveston, Texas at the East Flower Garden Bank wherein upwards of 80% of corals in a 0.06 km2 area died. Based on surveys of dead corals and other invertebrates shortly after this mortality event, responders hypothesized that localized hypoxia was the most likely direct cause. However, no dissolved oxygen data were available to test this hypothesis because oxygen is not continuously monitored within the Flower Garden Banks sanctuary. Here we quantify microbial plankton community diversity based on four cruises over two years at the Flower Garden Banks, including a cruise just 5-8 days after the mortality event was first observed. In contrast with observations collected during baseline conditions, microbial plankton communities in the thermocline were differentially enriched with taxa known to be active and abundant in oxygen minimum zones or that have known adaptations to oxygen limitation shortly after the mortality event (e.g. SAR324, Thioglobaceae, Nitrosopelagicus, and Thermoplasmata MGII). Unexpectedly, these enrichments were not localized to the East Bank, but were instead prevalent across the entire study area, suggesting there was a widespread depletion of dissolved oxygen concentrations in the thermocline around the time of the mortality event. Hydrographic analysis revealed the southern East Bank coral reef (where the localized mortality event occurred) was uniquely within the thermocline at this time. Our results demonstrate how temporal monitoring of microbial communities can be a useful tool to address questions related to past environmental events.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn the northwestern Gulf of Mexico in July 2016, upwards of 80% of corals in a small area of the East Flower Garden Bank coral reef suddenly died without warning. Oxygen depletion is believed to have been the cause. However, there was considerable uncertainty as no oxygen data is available from the time of the event. Microbes are sensitive to changes in oxygen and can be used as bioindicators of oxygen loss. In this study, we analyze microbial communities in water samples collected over several years at the Flower Garden Banks, including shortly after the mortality event. Our findings indicate that compared to normal conditions, oxygen depletion was widespread in the deep-water layer during the mortality event. Hydrographic analysis of water masses further revealed some of this low oxygen water likely upwelled onto the coral reef.",

Infection of pregnant rats during late gestation (embryonic day 14) resulted in vertical transmission to the placenta and widespread viral infection throughout the decidua, basal zone, and labyrinth zone. Some pups delivered from infected dams appeared normal while others had gross signs of teratogenicity including fetal death. Histopathological lesions were detected in placenta from pups regardless of teratogenicity, while teratogenic pups had more widespread hemorrhage throughout multiple placenta layers. Teratogenic events were also associated with significant increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines, type I interferons, and chemokines within the placental tissue. Thus, we found that RVFV displays a high degree of tropism for all placental tissue layers, and that the degree of hemorrhage and inflammatory mediator production is highest in placenta from pups with adverse outcomes. This is the first detailed pathological study of the mechanisms of RVFV infection of placental tissue in a tractable rodent model of congenital RVF disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-wide measurement of bacterial mRNA lifetimes using the antibiotic rifampicin has provided new insights into the control of bacterial mRNA decay. However, for long polycistronic mRNAs, the estimation of mRNA half-life can be confounded with transcriptional runoff caused by rifampicins inhibition of initiating RNA polymerases, and not elongating RNA polymerases.\n\nResultsWe present the Rif-correct software package, a free open-source tool that uses transcriptome models of transcript architecture to allow for more accurate mRNA half-life estimates that account for the transcriptional runoff. Rif-correct is implemented as a customizable python script that allows for users to control all the analysis parameters to achieve improved mRNA half-life estimates.\n\nConclusionsRif-correct is the first free open-source computational analysis pipeline for Rif-seq dataset mRNA half-life estimation.

    "abstract": "Alveolar macrophages are among the first cells to come into contact with inhaled fungal conidia of the human pathogenic fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. In lung alveoli, they contribute to phagocytosis and elimination of conidia. As a counter defense, conidia contain a grey-green pigment allowing them to survive in phagosomes of macrophages for some time. Previously, we showed that this conidial pigment interferes with the formation of flotillin-dependent lipid-rafts in the phagosomal membrane thereby preventing the formation of functional phagolysosomes. In this study, the role of the lipid raft-associated protein stomatin in macrophages during antifungal defense was investigated. To determine the function of this integral membrane protein, a stomatin-deficient macrophage cell line was generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry revealed that stomatin contributes to the phagocytosis of conidia and is important for recruitment of both the {beta}-glucan receptor dectin-1 and the vATPase to the membrane of phagosomes. In the stomatin knockout cell line, fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes was reduced when infected with pigmentless pksP conidia. Thus, our data suggest that stomatin is involved in maturation of phagosomes via fostering fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes.",

    "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis can cause meningococcal disease, a rapidly developing and potentially fatal infection. Despite this, it normally resides as a commensal in the nasopharynx of healthy individuals. The mechanisms by which meningococci access deeper tissues remain unknown. Epidemiological data suggest that mucosal disruptions increase the risk of meningococcal disease. We previously investigated whether meningococci inhibit host cell wound repair, enhancing invasive disease risk. Here, using genome sequencing and a collection of closely related household isolates that differ in their ability to inhibit host wound repair, we identify the responsible meningococcal factor. This protein, HpuA, has previously been characterized as part of a bipartite heme acquisition transporter. We constructed mutants to demonstrate that HpuA, but not HpuB, inhibits wound repair, acts as an adhesin for epithelial cells, and promotes cellular invasion. We showed this was not due to iron starvation resulting from the bacteria, differences in growth rate, or manipulation of host haptoglobin. Heterologous expression of HpuA in E. coli mediated adherence to 16HBE cells in an HpuA-dependent manner and conferred an aggregative phenotype onto E. coli, suggesting that HpuA may play a role in the formation of microcolonies on host cells. We also demonstrated that iron supplementation of meningococci restored the inhibition of wound repair in strains lacking HpuA (NZCM112, {Delta}hpuA mutant) to levels seen with the wild type. This was also seen with unrelated carriage strains previously shown not to inhibit wound repair. Iron supplementation also increased adherence and invasion of meningococci for strains lacking HpuA, while not affecting those that expressed HpuA. These findings suggest there may be a second meningococcal protein that inhibits wound repair. Together, these results suggest that HpuA is an important meningococcal virulence factor with multiple moonlighting functions, mediating adherence, invasion, inhibition of wound repair, and bacterial aggregation.\n\nAuthor SummaryNeisseria meningitidis causes meningococcal disease, a potentially fatal and rapidly developing illness that most often occurs in children. Despite this, the bacteria are frequently carried harmlessly as part of the normal airway microflora in healthy people, only rarely causing invasive disease, which involves replication in the bloodstream or central nervous system. It remains unknown precisely how the bacteria reach the deeper tissues from the airways, though some epidemiological evidence suggests that wounds or disruptions to the airways may increase risk. Here, we show that a N. meningitidis protein, HpuA, moonlights from its usual job of acquiring nutrients from the host, to enable the bacteria to adhere to and invade host cells, as well as inhibiting wound closure. Furthermore, we also show that meningococci that lack HpuA acquire the ability to inhibit wound repair when they are supplemented with iron, suggesting that there are additional meningococcal proteins to be discovered that may inhibit wound repair.",

    "abstract": "During cell division in Escherichia coli, the highly conserved tubulin homolog FtsZ polymerizes and assembles into a ring-like structure, called the Z-ring, at the site of septation early in the division pathway. For recruitment to the membrane surface, FtsZ polymers directly interact with membrane-associated proteins. In E. coli, membrane recruitment and tethering of FtsZ are predominantly carried out by FtsA. FtsA shares structural homology with actin and, like actin, hydrolyzes ATP. Yeast actin detects nucleotide occupancy through a sensor region adjacent to the nucleotide binding site and adopts distinct conformations in monomeric and filamentous actin. Accordingly, bacterial actin homologs also display considerable conformational flexibility across different nucleotide-bound states and adopt a polymerized conformation. Here, we show that a cluster of amino acid residues in the central region of FtsA and proximal to the nucleotide binding site are critical for FtsA function in vitro and in vivo. Each of these residues are important for ATP hydrolysis, phospholipid (PL) binding, ATP-dependent vesicle remodeling, and recruitment to the divisome in vivo, to varying degrees. Notably, we observed that Ser 84 and Glu 14 are essential for ATP-dependent vesicle remodeling and magnesium-dependent membrane release of FtsA from vesicles in vitro, and these defects likely underlie the loss of function by FtsA(E14R) and FtsA(S84L) in vivo. Finally, we demonstrate that FtsA(A188V), which is associated with temperature-sensitive growth in vivo, is defective for rapid ATP hydrolysis and ATP-dependent remodeling of PL vesicles in vitro. Together, our results show that loss of nucleotide-dependent activities by FtsA, such as ATP hydrolysis, ATP-dependent PL vesicle remodeling, and membrane release, lead to failed Z-ring assembly and division defects in cells.",

    "abstract": "Herpes Simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) maintains a lifelong latent infection in neurons and periodically reactivates, resulting in the production of infectious virus. The exact cellular pathways that induce reactivation are not understood. In primary neuronal models of HSV latency, the cellular protein Dual Leucine Zipper kinase (DLK) has been found to initiate a wave of viral gene expression known as Phase I. Phase I occurs independently of both viral DNA replication and the activities of histone demethylase enzymes required to remove repressive heterochromatin modifications associated with the viral genome. Here we investigated whether Phase-I like gene expression occurs in ganglia reactivated from infected mice. Using the combined trigger of explant-induced axotomy and inhibition of PI3K signaling, we found that HSV lytic gene expression was induced rapidly from both sensory and sympathetic neurons. Ex vivo reactivation involved a wave of viral late gene expression that occurred independently of viral genome synthesis and histone demethylase activity, and preceded the detection of infectious virus. Importantly, we found that DLK was required for the initial induction of lytic gene expression. These data confirm the essential role of DLK in inducing HSV-1 gene expression from the heterochromatin associated genome and further demonstrate that HSV-1 gene expression during reactivation occurs via mechanisms that are distinct from lytic replication.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of gene expression is tightly linked to the organization of the mammalian genome. With age, chromatin alterations occur on all levels of genome organization, accompanied by changes in the gene expression profile. However, little is known about the changes on the level of transcriptional regulation with age. Here, we used a multi-omic approach and integrated ATAC-, RNA- and NET-seq to identify age-related changes in the chromatin landscape of murine liver and to investigate how these are linked to transcriptional regulation. We provide the first systematic inventory of the connection between aging, chromatin accessibility and transcriptional regulation in a whole tissue. We observe that aging in murine liver is accompanied by an increase in chromatin accessibility at promoter regions of protein-coding genes. Yet, although promoter accessibility is a requirement for transcription, the increased accessibility does not result in enhanced transcriptional output. Instead, aging is accompanied by a decrease of promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). We propose that these changes in transcriptional regulation are due to a reduced stability of the pausing complex and may represent a mechanism to compensate for the age-related increase in chromatin accessibility in order to prevent aberrant transcription.",

    "abstract": "The premature aging disorder Nestor Guillermo Progeria Syndrome (NGPS) is caused by a homozygous Alanine to Threonine mutation at position 12 (A12T) in Barrier-to- Autointegration Factor (BAF). BAF is a small essential protein that binds to DNA and nuclear envelope proteins. It contributes to important cellular processes including transcription regulation and nuclear envelope reformation after mitosis. More recently, BAF was identified as an important factor for nuclear envelope repair upon rupture in interphase. However, the mechanism by which the BAF A12T mutation causes NGPS has remained unclear. To investigate the effects of this mutation on nuclear envelope integrity, we used NGPS-derived patient cells and engineered an isogenic cell line by reversing the BAF A12T homozygous mutation using CRISPR/Cas9. Using a combination of cellular models, structural data and in vitro assays, we identified that the A12T mutation reduces the affinity of BAF for lamin A/C by tenfold. As a result, BAF A12T is unable to recruit lamin A/C to sites of nuclear envelope rupture. This leads to persistent lamin A/C gaps at sites of ruptures, and contributes to nuclear fragility in NGPS patient cells, which show increased frequency of nuclear envelope re- rupturing. Overexpression of wild-type BAF in a NGPS context rescues lamin A/C recruitment to sites of nuclear rupture, which could explain why the heterozygous A12T mutation does not cause premature aging.",

    "abstract": "Genes encoding resistance to stressors, such as antibiotics or environmental pollutants, are widespread across microbiomes, often encoded on mobile genetic elements. Yet despite their prevalence, the impact of resistance genes and their mobility upon the dynamics of microbial communities remains largely unknown. Here we develop eco-evolutionary theory to explore how resistance genes alter the stability of diverse microbiomes. We show that adding resistance genes to a microbiome typically increases its overall stability, particularly for mobile resistance genes with high transfer rates that efficiently spread resistance throughout the community. However, the impact of resistance genes upon the stability of individual taxa varies depending upon the mobility of the resistance gene and the network of ecological interactions within the community. Non-mobile resistance genes can benefit susceptible taxa in cooperative communities, yet damage those in competitive communities. Moreover, whilst the transfer of mobile resistance genes generally increases the stability of previously susceptible recipient taxa to perturbation, it can, counterintuitively, decrease the stability of the originally resistant donor species. We confirmed these theoretical predictions experimentally using competitive soil microcosm communities. Here the stability of a susceptible microbial community to perturbation was increased by adding mobile resistance genes encoded on conjugative plasmids but was decreased when these same genes were encoded on the chromosome. Together these findings highlight the importance of horizontal gene transfer in driving the eco-evolutionary dynamics of diverse microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies for cancer biomarker discovery based on pre-diagnostic blood DNA methylation profiles, either ignore the explicit modeling of the time to diagnosis (TTD) as in a survival analysis setting, or provide inconsistent results. This lack of consistency is likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work, we argue that a global approach to estimate CpG sites effect profile is needed, and we claim that such approach should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. To prove our concept, we develop a new Deep Learning-based approach assessing the relevance of individual CpG Islands (i.e., assigning a weight to each site) in determining TTD while modeling their combined effect in a survival analysis scenario. The algorithm combines a tailored sampling procedure with DNAm sites agglomeration, deep non-linear survival modeling and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values estimation to aid robustness of the derived effects profile. The proposed approach deal with the common complexities arising from epidemiological studies, such as small sample size, noise, and low signal-to-noise ratio of blood-derived DNAm. We apply our approach to a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort and we perform weighted gene-set enrichment analyses to demonstrate the biological meaningfulness of the obtained results. We compared the results of Deep Survival EWAS with those of a traditional EWAS approach, demonstrating that our method performs better than the standard approach in identifying biologically relevant pathways.\n\nAuthor summaryBlood-derived DNAm profiles could be exploited as new biomarkers for cancer risk stratification and possibly, early detection. This is of particular interest since blood is a convenient tissue to assay for constitutional methylation and its collection is non-invasive. Exploiting pre-diagnostic blood DNAm data opens the further opportunity to investigate the association of DNAm at baseline on cancer risk, modeling the relationship between sites methylation and the Time to Diagnosis. Previous studies mostly provide inconsistent results likely due to the limitations of standard EWAS approaches, that model the effect of DNAm at CpG sites on TTD independently. In this work we argue that an approach to estimate single CpG sites effect while modeling their combined effect on the survival outcome is needed, and we claim that such approach should capture the complex (potentially non-linear) relationships interplaying between sites. We prove this concept by developing a novel approach to analyze a prospective case-control study on breast cancer nested in the EPIC Italy cohort. A weighted gene set enrichment analysis confirms that our approach outperforms standard EWAS in identifying biologically meaningful pathways.",

VLPs assemble from many copies of capsid protein, with combinatorial intermediates, and therefore the mechanism of the reaction is poorly understood. In this paper, we determined the effect of ionic strength on the assembly of Simian Vacuolating Virus 40 (SV40)-like particles. We mixed poly(styrene sulfonate) with SV40 capsid protein pentamers at different ionic strengths. We then characterized the assembly product by solution small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-TEM. To analyze the data, we performed Brownian dynamics simulations using a coarse-grained model that revealed incomplete, asymmetric VLP structures that were consistent with the experimental data.

    "abstract": "Cell mechanics and motility are responsible for collective motion of cells that result in overall deformation of epithelial tissues. On the other hand, contact-dependent cell-cell signalling is responsible for generating a large variety of intricate, self-organized, spatial patterns of the signalling molecules. Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that the combined mechanochemical patterns of cell shape/size and signalling molecules in the tissues, for example, in cancerous and sensory epithelium, are governed by mechanochemical coupling between chemical signalling and cell mechanics. However, a clear quantitative picture of how these two aspects of tissue dynamics, i.e., signalling and mechanics, lead to pattern and form is still emerging. Although, a number of recent experiments demonstrate that cell mechanics, cell motility, and cell-cell signalling are tightly coupled in many morphogenetic processes, relatively few modeling efforts have focused on an integrated approach. We extend the vertex model of an epithelial monolayer to account for contact-dependent signalling between adjacent cells and between non-adjacent neighbors through long protrusional contacts with a feedback mechanism wherein the adhesive strength between adjacent cells is controlled by the expression of the signalling molecules in those cells. Local changes in cell-cell adhesion lead to changes in cell shape and size, which in turn drives changes in the levels of signalling molecules. Our simulations show that even this elementary two-way coupling of chemical signalling and cell mechanics is capable of giving rise to a rich variety of mechanochemical patterns in epithelial tissues. In particular, under certain parametric conditions, bimodal distributions in cell size and shape are obtained, which resemble experimental observations in cancerous and sensory tissues.",

    "abstract": "The NSD2 p.E1099K (EK) mutation has been shown to be enriched in patients with relapsed ALL and found to play a role in clonal fitness dependent on the underlying genetic/epigenetic landscape of the cells. To uncover 3D chromatin architecture-related mechanisms underlying drug resistance, we systematically integrated Hi-C, ATAC-seq, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data from three B-ALL cell lines heterozygous for NSD2 EK (RS4;11, RCH-ACV, SEM) and assessed changes upon knockdown. NSD2 knockdown revealed widespread remodeling of the 3D genome, specifically in terms of compartmentalization. Systematic integration of these datasets revealed significant switches in A/B compartments with a strong bias towards B compartments upon knockdown, suggesting that NSD2 EK plays a prominent role in maintaining A compartments through enrichment of H3K36me2 epigenetic marks. In contrast, we identified few changes in intra-TAD activity suggesting that the NSD2 EK impacts transcriptional changes through a remarkable dependence on compartmentalization. Furthermore, EK-mediated reorganization of compartments highlights the existence of a common core of compacting loci shared across the three cell lines that explain previously described phenotypes as well as serve as targets for therapeutic intervention. This study offers a novel mechanism by which NSD2 EK drives clonal evolution and drug resistance.",

    "abstract": "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) used for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) eradicates tumors in approximately 45% of patients. Unfortunately, TNBC patients with substantial residual cancer burden have poor metastasis free and overall survival rates. We previously demonstrated mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was elevated and was a unique therapeutic dependency of residual TNBC cells surviving NACT. We sought to investigate the mechanism underlying this enhanced reliance on mitochondrial metabolism. Mitochondria are morphologically plastic organelles that cycle between fission and fusion to maintain mitochondrial integrity and metabolic homeostasis. The functional impact of mitochondrial structure on metabolic output is highly context dependent and not understood in TNBC. Several chemotherapy agents are conventionally used for neoadjuvant treatment of TNBC patients. Upon comparing mitochondrial effects of commonly used chemotherapies, we found that DNA-damaging agents increased mitochondrial elongation, mitochondrial content, flux of glucose through the TCA cycle, and OXPHOS, whereas taxanes instead decreased mitochondrial elongation and OXPHOS. Additionally, short protein isoform levels of the mitochondrial inner membrane fusion protein optic atrophy 1 (OPA1) were associated with those observations. Further, we observed heightened OXPHOS, OPA1 protein levels, and mitochondrial elongation in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of residual TNBC. Pharmacologic or genetic disruption of mitochondrial fusion and fission resulted in decreased or increased OXPHOS, respectively, revealing that longer mitochondria favor oxphos in TNBC cells. Using TNBC cell lines and an in vivo PDX model of residual TNBC, we found that sequential treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapy, thus inducing mitochondrial fusion and OXPHOS, followed by MYLS22, a specific inhibitor of OPA1, was able to suppress mitochondrial fusion and OXPHOS and significantly inhibited residual tumor regrowth. Taken together, our findings suggest that TNBC mitochondria can optimize OXPHOS through modulation of mitochondrial structure. This may provide an opportunity to overcome mitochondrial adaptations of chemoresistant TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Age-related deficits in auditory nerve (AN) function reduce afferent input to the auditory cortex. The extent to which the auditory cortex in older adults compensates for this loss of afferent input, also known as central gain, and the mechanisms underlying this compensation are not well understood. We took a neural systems approach to estimate central gain, measuring AN and cortical evoked responses within 50 older and 27 younger adults. Amplitudes were significantly smaller for older than for younger adults for AN responses but not for cortical responses. We used the relationship between AN and cortical response amplitudes in younger adults to predict cortical response amplitudes for older adults from their AN responses. Central gain in older adults was thus defined as the difference between their observed cortical responses and those predicted from the parameter estimates of younger adults. More central gain was associated with decreased cortical levels of GABA measured with 1H-MRS and poorer speech recognition in noise (SIN). Effects of central gain and GABA on SIN occur in addition to, and independent from, effects attributed to elevated hearing thresholds. Our results are consistent with animal models of central gain and suggest that reduced AN afferent input in some older adults may result in changes in cortical encoding and inhibitory neurotransmission, which contribute to reduced SIN. An advancement in our understanding of the changes that occur throughout the auditory system in response to the gradual loss of input with increasing age may provide potential therapeutic targets for intervention.\n\nSignificanceAge-related hearing loss is one of the most common chronic conditions of aging, yet little is known about how the cortex compensates for this loss of sensory input. We measured AN and cortical responses to the same stimulus in younger and older adults. In older adults we found an increase in cortical activity following concomitant declines in afferent input that are consistent with central gain. Increased central gain was associated with lower levels of cortical GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, which predicted poorer speech recognition in noise. The results suggest that the cortex in older adults can compensate for attenuated sensory input by reducing inhibition to amplify the cortical response, but this amplification may lead to poorer speech recognition in noise.",

    "abstract": "Syntax involves complex neurobiological mechanisms, which are difficult to disentangle for multiple reasons. Using a protocol able to separate syntactic information from sound information we investigated the neural causal connections evoked by the processing of homophonous phrases, either verb phrases (VP) or noun phrases (NP). We used event-related causality (ERC) from stereo-electroencephalographic (SEEG) recordings in 10 epileptic patients in multiple cortical areas, including language areas and their homologous in the non-dominant hemisphere. We identified the different networks involved in the processing of these syntactic operations (faster in the dominant hemisphere) showing that VPs engage a wider cortical network. We also present a proof-of-concept for the decoding of the syntactic category of a perceived phrase based on causality measures. Our findings help unravel the neural correlates of syntactic elaboration and show how a decoding based on multiple cortical areas could contribute to the development of speech prostheses for speech impairment mitigation.",

Reproducing human cardiogenesis with neurogenesis in a multi-lineage context remains challenging, requiring spatiotemporal input of paracrine and mechanical cues. Here we extend elongating multi-lineage organized (EMLO) gastruloids to include cardiogenesis (EMLOC) and describe interconnected neuro-cardiac lineages in a single gastruloid model. Contractile EMLOCs recapitulate numerous interlinked developmental features including heart tube formation and specialization, cardiomyocyte differentiation and remodeling phases, epicardium, ventricular wall morphogenesis, chamber-like structures and formation of a putative outflow tract. The EMLOC cardiac region, which originates anterior to gut tube primordium, is progressively populated by neurons in a spatial pattern mirroring the known distribution of neurons in the innervated human heart. This human EMLOC model represents the first multi-lineage advancement for the study of coincident neurogenesis and cardiogenesis.",
