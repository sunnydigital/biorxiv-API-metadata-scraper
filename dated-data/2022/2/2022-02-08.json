    "abstract": "Most research on individual differences in performance on tests of cognitive ability focuses on general cognitive ability (g), the highest level in the three-level Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) hierarchical model of intelligence. About 50% of the variance of g is due to inherited DNA differences (heritability) which increases across development. Much less is known about the genetics of the middle level of the CHC model, which includes 16 broad factors such as fluid reasoning, processing speed, and quantitative knowledge. We provide a meta-analytic review of 863,041 monozygotic-dizygotic twin comparisons from 80 publications for these middle-level factors, which we refer to as specific cognitive abilities (SCA). Twin comparisons were available for 11 of the 16 CHC domains. The average heritability across all SCA is 55%, similar to the heritability of g. However, there is substantial differential heritability and the SCA do not show the dramatic developmental increase in heritability seen for g. We also investigated SCA independent of g (g-corrected SCA, which we refer to as SCA.g). A surprising finding is that SCA.g remain substantially heritable (53% on average), even though 25% of the variance of SCA that covaries with g has been removed. Our review frames expectations for genomic research that will use polygenic scores to predict SCA and SCA.g. Genome-wide association studies of SCA.g are needed to create polygenic scores that can predict SCA profiles of cognitive abilities and disabilities independent of g. These could be used to foster childrens cognitive strengths and minimise their weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveHigh-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) allows the reliable identification of individual motor unit (MU) action potentials. Despite the accuracy in decomposition, there is a large variability in the number of identified MUs across individuals and exerted forces. Here we present a systematic investigation of the anatomical and neural factors that determine this variability.\n\nApproachWe investigated factors of influence on HD-sEMG decomposition, such as synchronization of MU discharges, distribution of MU territories, muscle-electrode distance (MED - subcutaneous fat thickness), maximum anatomical cross-sectional area (ACSAmax), and fiber CSA. For this purpose, we recorded HD-sEMG signals, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and muscle biopsy of the biceps brachii muscle from two groups of participants - untrained-controls (UT=14) and strength-trained (>3 years of training, ST=16) - while they performed isometric ramp contractions with elbow flexors (at 15, 35, 50 and 70% maximum voluntary torque - MVT). We assessed the correlation between the number of accurately detected MUs by HD-sEMG decomposition and each measured parameter, for each target force level. Multiple regression analysis was then applied.\n\nMain resultsST subjects showed lower MED (UT: 4.8 {+/-} 1.4 vs. ST: 3.7 {+/-} 0.8 mm) associated to a greater number of identified motor units (UT: 21.3 {+/-} 10.2 vs. ST: 29.2 {+/-} 11.8 MUs/subject). Both groups showed a negative correlation between MED and the number of identified MUs at low forces (r= -0.6, p=0.002 at 15% MVT). Moreover, the number of identified MUs was positively correlated to the distribution of MU territories (r=0.56, p=0.01) and ACSAmax (r=0.48, p=0.03) at 15% MVT. By accounting for all anatomical parameters, we were able to partly predict the number of decomposed MUs at low but not at high forces.\n\nSignificanceOur results confirmed the influence of subcutaneous tissue on the quality of HD-sEMG signals and demonstrated that MU spatial distribution and ACSAmax are also relevant parameters of influence for current decomposition algorithms.",

Here we describe LRLoop, a new method for analyzing cell-cell communication that is based on bi-directional ligand-receptor interactions, where two pairs of ligand-receptor interactions are identified that are responsive to each other, and thereby form a closed feedback loop. We assessed LRLoop using both bulk and single-cell datasets and found our method significantly reduces the false positive rate seen with existing methods. Finally, we applied LRLoop to the single-cell datasets obtained from retinal development and discovered many new bi-directional ligand-receptor interactions among individual cell types that potentially control proliferation, neurogenesis and/or cell fate specification.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a small subpopulation of cells within tumors that are resistant to anti-tumor therapies, making them a likely origin of tumor relapse after treatment. In many cancers including breast cancer, CSC function is regulated by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), making GPCR signaling an attractive target for new therapies designed to eradicate CSCs. Yet, CSCs overexpress multiple GPCRs that are redundant in maintaining CSC function, so it is unclear how to target all the various GPCRs to prevent relapse. Here, in a model of HER2+ breast cancer (i.e., transgenic MMTV-Neu mice), we were able to block tumorsphere- and tumor-forming capability of CSCs by targeting GPCRs coupled to Gi/o proteins (Gi/o-GPCRs). Similarly, in HER2+ breast cancer cells, blocking signaling downstream of Gi/o-GPCRs in the PI3K/AKT and Src pathways also enhanced HER2-targeted elimination of CSCs. In a proof-of-concept study, when CSCs were selectively ablated (via a suicide gene construct), loss of CSCs from HER2+ breast cancer cell populations mimicked the effect of targeting Gi/o-GPCR signaling, suppressing their capacity for tumor initiation and progression and enhancing HER2-targeted therapy. Thus, targeting Gi/o-GPCR signaling in HER2+ breast cancer is a promising approach for eradicating CSCs, enhancing HER2+ targeted therapy and blocking tumor reemergence.",

Here, we assembled a chromosome-level phased Valencia SWO (DVS) genome with [~]98.5% completeness, high accuracy (QV=50.6), and the highest annotation BUSCO completeness (99.2%) thus far in citrus. DVS harbors a high level of allelic variances and enables study of allelic somatic structural mutations and corresponding allelic expression alteration in two SWO mutants, one with high Huanglongbing tolerance (T19) and one more sensitive (T78). In T78, a large deletion on the pummelo-origin chr8 causes regional allelic expression absence. In T19, seven upregulated genes are located at one terminal of a translocated segment, including three genes related to heat shock protein (HSP) regulation. Furthermore, 68 of 133 HSPs are significantly upregulated in T19, which may be related to its enhanced HLB tolerance by preventing phloem necrosis. The DVS will advance allelic level studies in citrus.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionIdentifying the psychophysiological underpinnings of cue-induced compulsive nicotine use will provide new targets for relapse prevention treatments. We tested whether neuroaffective responses to motivationally relevant stimuli are associated with cue-induced nicotine self-administration. We hypothesized that smokers with stronger neuroaffective responses to nicotine-related cues than to pleasant stimuli (C>P) are more vulnerable to cue-induced nicotine self-administration than smokers with stronger neuroaffective responses to pleasant stimuli than to nicotine-related cues (P>C).\n\nMethodsSmokers (N=36) looked at pleasant, unpleasant, neutral, and nicotine-related images signaling that an electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) was immediately available for use. We measured event-related potentials (a direct measure of cortical activity) and computed the amplitude of the late positive potential, a robust index of motivational salience. We used k-means cluster analysis to identify individuals characterized by the C>P or the P>C neuroaffective profile. We compared the ENDS use frequency in the two groups using quantile regression for counts.\n\nResultsCluster analysis assigned 18 smokers to the C>P profile and 18 smokers to the P>C profile. Smokers with the C>P neuroaffective profile used the ENDS significantly more often than smokers with the P>C profile. Significant differences in the number of puffs persisted across different quantiles.\n\nConclusionsThese results support the hypothesis that individual differences in the tendency to attribute motivational salience to drug-related cues underlie vulnerability to cue-induced drug self-administration.\n\nImplicationsBy linking brain reactivity profiles to nicotine self-administration, we identified a neuroaffective biomarker that could guide the development of personalized treatments to prevent smoking relapse.",

    "abstract": "Associating environmental context with emotional experience is a vital brain function that requires the activity in both dorsal and ventral hippocampus. While only ventral hippocampus connects with the amygdala, a hub for fear learning, it remains unclear how the two hippocampal areas interact during contextual fear conditioning (CFC). We found that projections from dorsal CA2/CA3 (dCA2/3) to the dorsal part of ventral CA1 (vCA1d) contributed significantly to CFC. Deep-brain Ca2+ imaging revealed a CFC-enhanced difference in neuronal activities evoked by conditioned vs. neutral environmental context in both dCA2/3 and vCA1d areas. Notably, contextual fear retrieval correlated with changes in conditioned context-evoked activity in vCA1d, but not in dCA2/3. Furthermore, slice recordings showed that CFC potentiated dCA2/3-to-vCA1d projection strength, in line with coordinated elevation of monosynaptic excitation and reduction of disynaptic inhibition mediated by somatostatin-expressing interneurons. Thus, vCA1d represents a critical site for initiating emotional association with contextual information from dCA2/3.",

    "abstract": "Temporal information is ubiquitous in natural vision and must be represented accurately in the brain to allow us to interact with a constantly changing world. Recent studies have employed a random stimulation paradigm to map the temporal response function (TRF) to luminance changes in the human EEG. This approach has revealed that the visual system, when presented with broadband visual input, actively selects distinct temporal frequencies, and retains their phase-information for prolonged periods of time. This non-linear response likely originates in primary visual cortex (V1), yet, so far it has not been investigated on a neural level. Here, we characterize the steady-state response to random broadband visual flicker in marmoset V1. In two experiments, we recorded from i) marmosets passively stimulated under general anesthesia, and ii) awake marmosets, under free viewing conditions. Our results show that LFP coupling to the stimulus was broadband and unselective under anesthesia, whereas in awake animals, it was restricted to two distinct frequency components, in the alpha and beta range. Within these frequency bands, coupling adhered to the receptive field (RF) boundaries of the local populations. The responses outside the RF did not provide evidence for a propagation of stimulus information across the cortex, contrary to results in human EEG studies. This result may be explained by short fixation durations, warranting further investigation. In summary, our findings show that during awake behavior V1 neural responses to broadband information are selective for distinct frequency bands, and that this selectivity is likely controlled actively by top-down mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Here we show that deleting NMNAT2 from cortical glutamatergic neurons (NMNAT2 cKO) results in progressive axonal loss, neuroinflammation, small hippocampi and enlarged ventricles. Interestingly, dramatic neuroinflammation responses were observed around the long-range axonal tracts of NMNAT2 cKO cortical neurons. In addition to the neurodegenerative-like phenotype, we also found the absence of whisker-representation patterns \"barrels\" in the primary somatosensory cortex of NMNAT2 cKO mice. These observations suggest that NMNAT2 is required in developing cortical circuits and in maintaining the health of cortical neurons. Unbiased transcriptomic analysis suggests that NMNAT2 loss in cortical neurons after axonal outgrowth phase upregulates mitochondria function while greatly reducing synaptogenesis pathways. Complete loss of Sarm1 function in NMNAT2 cKO mice restores barrel map formation and axonal integrity and abolishes the inflammatory response. Interestingly, reducing Sarm1 function in NMNAT2 cKO mice by deleting only one copy of Sarm1 restores barrel map formation but did not diminish the neurodegenerative-like phenotype. Only complete loss of Sarm1 prevents neurodegeneration and inflammatory responses.",

    "abstract": "Sunlight drives phototrophic metabolism, which affects redox conditions and produces substrates for non-phototrophs. These environmental parameters fluctuate daily due to Earths rotation, and non-phototrophic organisms can therefore benefit from the ability to respond to, or even anticipate, such changes. Circadian rhythms, such as daily changes in body temperature, in host organisms can also affect local conditions for colonizing bacteria. Here, we investigated the effects of light/dark and temperature cycling on biofilms of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14. We grew biofilms in the presence of a respiratory indicator dye and found that greater dye reduction occurred in biofilm zones that formed during dark intervals and at lower temperatures. This pattern formation occurred with cycling of blue, red, or far-red light, and a screen of mutants representing potential sensory proteins identified two with defects in pattern formation, specifically under red light cycling. We also found that the physiological states of biofilm subzones formed under specific light and temperature conditions were retained during subsequent condition cycling. Light/dark and temperature cycling affected expression of genes involved in primary metabolic pathways and redox homeostasis, including those encoding electron transport chain components. Consistent with this, we found that cbb3-type oxidases contribute to dye reduction under light/dark cycling conditions. Together, our results indicate that cyclic changes in light exposure and temperature have lasting effects on redox metabolism in biofilms formed by a non-phototrophic, pathogenic bacterium.\n\nIMPORTANCEOrganisms that do not obtain energy from light can nevertheless be affected by daily changes in light exposure. Many aspects of animal and fungal physiology fluctuate in response to these changes, including body temperature and the activities of antioxidant and other redox enzymes that play roles in metabolism. Whether redox metabolism is affected by light/dark and temperature cycling in bacteria that colonize such circadian organisms has not been studied in detail. Here we show that growth under light/dark and temperature cycling leads to rhythmic changes in redox metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and identify proteins involved in this response. P. aeruginosa is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections and designated as a serious threat by the CDC due to its recalcitrance during treatments. Our findings have the potential to inform therapeutic strategies that incorporate controlled light exposure or consider P. aeruginosas responses to conditions in the host.",

    "abstract": "During viral infection, competition ensues between viruses and their host cells to control the protein synthesis machinery. In response, certain host defense proteins globally limit mRNA translation. However, this is also detrimental for host protein synthesis. Here we describe an interferon-stimulated helicase, DDX60, that specifically inhibits translation from type II viral internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs). IRESs are RNA structures that enable mRNAs to recruit ribosomes directly, bypassing translation initiation using a 5 cap. DDX60 was previously observed to inhibit replication of a reporter hepatitis C virus (HCV). We show that DDX60 likely does not inhibit HCV replication, but surprisingly, inhibits the type II IRES used in the reporter HCV genomic RNA. Using firefly luciferase mRNAs translationally driven by different viral IRESs or a 5 cap analog, we show that DDX60 selectively reduces translation driven by type II IRESs of encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), but not other IRES types or a 5 cap analog. Correspondingly, DDX60 reduces EMCV and FMDV (type II IRES) replication, but not poliovirus or bovine enterovirus 1 (type I IRES) replication. Furthermore, replacing the IRES of poliovirus with a type II IRES is sufficient for DDX60 to inhibit poliovirus replication. Finally, we demonstrate that DDX60 specifically reduces polysome binding on type II IRES mRNA, but not 5 cap-dependent mRNA. Our data demonstrate that the cellular defense factor DDX60 counteracts viral takeover of host translation by blocking ribosome access to type II IRES elements specifically.",

In this investigation, we demonstrate that TRP120 has a novel repetitive short liner motif (SLiM) that activates the evolutionarily conserved Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway to inhibit apoptosis. In silico analysis revealed that TRP120 has sequence and functional similarity with Hh ligands and a candidate Hh ligand SLiM was identified. siRNA knockdown of Hh signaling and transcriptional components significantly reduced infection. Co-immunoprecipitation and surface plasmon resonance demonstrated that rTRP120-TR interacted directly with Hh receptor Patched-2 (PTCH2). E. chaffeensis infection resulted in early activation of Hh transcription factor GLI-1 and upregulation of Hh target genes. Moreover, soluble recombinant TRP120 (rTRP120) activated Hh and induced gene expression consistent with the eukaryotic Hh ligand. The TRP120 Hh SLiM (NPEVLIKD) induced nuclear translocation of GLI-1 in THP-1 cells and primary human monocytes and induced a rapid and expansive activation of Hh pathway target genes. Furthermore, Hh activation was blocked by an -TRP120 Hh SLiM antibody.\n\nTRP120 Hh SLiM significantly increased levels of Hh target, anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2), and siRNA knockdown of BCL-2 dramatically inhibited infection.\n\nBlocking Hh signaling with the inhibitor Vismodegib, induced a pro-apoptotic cellular program defined by decreased mitochondria membrane potential, significant reductions in BCL-2, activation of caspase 3 and 9, and increased apoptotic cells. This study reveals a novel E. chaffeensis SLiM ligand mimetic that activates Hh signaling to maintain E. chaffeensis infection by engaging a BCL-2 anti-apoptotic cellular program.\n\nAuthor summary\n\nEhrlichia chaffeensis is an obligately intracellular bacterium that preferentially infects and replicates within mononuclear phagocytes and survives intracellularly by modulating cellular signaling pathways to subvert innate immune defenses. This investigation reveals the complex and expanding role that the E. chaffeensis TRP120 moonlighting effector and SLiM ligand mimetics have on immune subversion and infection through activation and regulation of evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways. Herein, we define a TRP120 Hh SLiM mimetic that induces Hh signaling and regulates the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-2 to prevent sequential activation of caspase 9 and 3, promoting E. chaffeensis infection. This study defines a novel prokaryotic SLiM mimetic that repurposes evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic signaling pathways to promote survival of an intracellular bacterium.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial type IV secretion systems (T4SSs) are macromolecular machines that translocate effector proteins across multiple membranes into infected host cells. Loss of function mutations in genes encoding protein components of the T4SS render bacteria avirulent, highlighting the attractiveness of T4SSs as drug targets. Here, we designed an automated high-throughput screening approach for the identification of compounds that interfere with the delivery of a reporter-effector fusion protein from Legionella pneumophila into RAW264.7 mouse macrophages. Using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based detection assay in a bacteria/macrophage co-culture format, we screened a library of over 18,000 compounds and, upon vetting compound candidates in a variety of in vitro and cell-based secondary screens, isolated several hits that efficiently interfered with biological processes that depend on a functional T4SS, such as intracellular bacterial proliferation or lysosomal avoidance, but had no detectable effect on L. pneumophila growth in culture medium, conditions under which the T4SS is dispensable. Notably, the same hit compounds also attenuated, to varying degrees, effector delivery by the closely related T4SS from Coxiella burnetii, notably without impacting growth of this organism within synthetic media. Together, these results support the idea that interference with T4SS function is a possible therapeutic intervention strategy, and the emerging compounds provide tools to interrogate at a molecular level the regulation and dynamics of these virulence-critical translocation machines.\n\nImportanceMulti-drug-resistant pathogens are an emerging threat to human health. Since conventional antibiotics target not only the pathogen but also eradicate the beneficial microbiota, they often cause additional clinical complications. Thus, there is an urgent need for the development of \"smarter\" therapeutics that selectively target pathogens without affecting beneficial commensals. The bacterial type IV secretion system (T4SS) is essential for the virulence of a variety of pathogens but dispensable for bacterial viability in general and can, thus, be considered a pathogens Achilles heel. By identifying small molecules that interfere with cargo delivery by the T4SS from two important human pathogens, Legionella pneumophila and Coxiella burnetii, our study represents the first step in our pursuit towards precision medicine by developing pathogen-selective therapeutics capable of treating the infections without causing harm to commensal bacteria.",

Paradoxically, knowledge of the genetics of the pathogen population in the Americas is very limited. In this study, a collection of 178 monosporic isolates from several banana producing regions, located in different climatic zones along a South to North transect in Brazil, was formed to assess the genetic structure of the population of Foc. The isolates underwent pathogenicity tests, PCR diagnosis for the detection of Tropical race 4 and screening to SIX homologs. The VCG of 119 isolates was determined by pairing against 17 testers. A group of 158 isolates was selected for microsatellite genotyping. There was moderate diversity of Foc in Brazil. Eight VCGs were identified: 0120, 0122, 0124, 0125, 0128, 01215, 01220, and 01222, of which 78% of isolates belong to a single VCG, while 22% of isolates belong to complexes of VCGs. The distribution of VCGs is uneven and independent of the banana genotype. VCGs were correlated with homologs of the SIX genes and varied according to geographic regions. Four SSR loci were polymorphic and on average 7.5 alleles were detected per locus. Thirty-five multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were identified. There was no association between VCG and MLGs and no genetic structure of the population of Foc in Brazil was detected.",

    "abstract": "Current knowledge of plant viruses stems largely from those affecting economically important plants. Yet, plant species in cultivation represent a small and bias subset of the plant kingdom. Here, we describe virus diversity and abundance from a survey of 1079 transcriptomes from species across the breadth of the plant kingdom (Archaeplastida) by analysing open-source data from the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative (1KP). We identified 104 potentially novel viruses, of which 40% comprised single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses across eight orders, including members of the Hepelivirales, Tymovirales, Cryppavirales, Martellivirales and Picornavirales. One-third of the newly described viruses comprised double-stranded RNA viruses from the orders Durnavirales and Ghabrivirales. The remaining were negative-sense RNA viruses from the Rhabdoviridae, Aspiviridae, Yueviridae, Phenuiviridae and the newly proposed Viridisbunyaviridae. Our analysis considerably expands the known host range of 13 virus families to include lower plants (e.g., Benyviridae and Secoviridae) and four virus families to include algae hosts (e.g., Tymoviridae and Chrysoviridae). The discovery of the first 30 kDa movement protein in a non-vascular plant, suggests that the acquisition of plant virus movement proteins occurred prior to the emergence of the plant vascular system. More broadly, however, a co-phylogeny analysis revealed that the evolutionary history of these families is largely driven by cross-species transmission events. Together, these data highlight that numerous RNA virus families are associated with older evolutionary plant lineages than previously thought and that the scarcity of RNA viruses found in lower plants to date likely reflects a lack of investigation rather than their absence.\n\nImportanceOur knowledge of plant viruses is mainly limited to those infecting economically important host species. In particular, we know little about those viruses infecting primitive plant lineages such as the ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes and charophytes. To expand this understanding, we conducted a broad-scale viral survey of species across the breadth of the plant kingdom. We find that primitive plants harbour a wide diversity of RNA viruses including some that are sufficiently divergent to comprise a new virus family. The primitive plant virome we reveal offers key insights into the evolutionary history of core plant virus gene modules and genome segments. More broadly, this work emphasises that the scarcity of viruses found in these species to date likely reflects the absence of research in this area.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities thrive in almost all habitats on earth. Within these communities, cells interact through the release and uptake of metabolites. These interactions can have synergistic or antagonistic effects on individual community members. The collective metabolic activity of microbial communities leads to changes in their local environment. As the environment changes over time, the nature of the interactions between cells can change. We currently lack understanding of how such dynamic feedbacks affect the growth dynamics of individual microbes and of the community as a whole. Here we study how interactions mediated by the exchange of metabolites through the environment change over time within a simple marine microbial community. We used a microfluidic-based approach that allows us to disentangle the effect cells have on their environment from how they respond to their environment. We found that the interactions between two species - a degrader of chitin and a cross-feeder that consumes metabolic by-products - changes dynamically over time as cells modify their environment. Cells initially interact positively and then start to compete at later stages of growth. Our results demonstrate that interactions between microbes are not static and depend on the state of the environment, emphasizing the importance of disentangling how modifications of the environment affects species interactions. This experimental approach can shed new light on how interspecies interactions scale up to community level processes in natural environments.",

    "abstract": "The genus Methylobacterium includes widespread plant-associated bacteria that dominate the plant phyllosphere (occupying leaf surfaces), consume plant-secreted methanol, and can produce plant growth promoting metabolites. However, despite the potential to increase agricultural productivity, their impact on host fitness in the natural environment is relatively poorly understood. Here, we conducted field experiments with three traditionally cultivated rice landraces from north eastern India. We inoculated seedlings with native vs. non-native phyllosphere Methylobacterium strains, finding significant impacts on plant growth and grain yield. However, these effects were variable: whereas some Methylobacterium isolates were beneficial for their host, others had no impact or were no more beneficial than the bacterial growth medium. Host plant benefits were not consistently associated with Methylobacterium colonization, altered phyllosphere microbiome composition, changes in early expression of plant stress response pathways, or bacterial auxin production. We provide the first clear demonstration of the benefits of phyllosphere Methylobacterium for rice yield under field conditions, and highlight the need for further analysis to understand the mechanisms underlying these benefits. Given that the host landrace-Methylobacterium relationship is not generalizable, future agricultural applications will require careful testing to identify coevolved host- bacterium pairs that may enhance the productivity of high-value rice varieties.",

This places a significant burden on healthcare providers, delaying treatment and leading to adverse patient outcomes.

Four WHO priority pathogens are AST phenotyped and their antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profile determined by WGS. On application of ME-RS method we find high correlation with the WGS characterization. Highly accurate classification based on the species (98.93%), wild-type/non-wild type (99.45%), and presence or absence of thick peptidoglycan layers in cell walls (100%), as well as at the individual strain level (99.29%).

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) genetic exchange through reassortment has the potential to accelerate viral evolution and has played a critical role in the generation of multiple pandemic strains. For reassortment to occur, distinct viruses must co-infect the same cell. The spatio-temporal dynamics of viral dissemination within an infected host therefore define opportunity for reassortment. Here, we used wild type and synonymously barcoded variant viruses of a pandemic H1N1 strain to examine the within-host viral dynamics that govern reassortment in guinea pigs, ferrets and swine. The first two species are well-established models of human influenza, while swine are a natural host and a frequent conduit for cross-species transmission and reassortment. Our results show reassortment to be pervasive in all three hosts but less frequent in swine than in ferrets and guinea pigs. In ferrets, tissue-specific differences in the opportunity for reassortment are also evident, with more reassortants detected in the nasal tract than the lower respiratory tract. While temporal trends in viral diversity are limited, spatial patterns are clear, with heterogeneity in the viral genotypes detected at distinct anatomical sites revealing extensive compartmentalization of reassortment and replication. Our data indicate that the dynamics of viral replication in mammals allow diversification through reassortment but that the spatial compartmentalization of variants likely shapes their evolution and onward transmission.",

    "abstract": "Naturally fluctuating temperatures provide a constant environmental stress that requires adaptation. Some fungal pathogens respond to heat stress by producing new morphotypes that maximize their overall fitness. The fungal wheat pathogen Z. tritici responds to heat stress by switching from its yeast-like blastospore form to hyphae or chlamydospores. The regulatory mechanisms underlying this switch are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that a differential heat stress response is ubiquitous in Z. tritici populations around the world. We used QTL mapping to identify a single locus associated with the temperature-dependent morphogenesis and we found two genes, the transcription factor ZtMsr1 and the protein phosphatase ZtYvh1, regulating this mechanism. We find that ZtMsr1 regulates repression of hyphal growth and induces chlamydospore formation whereas ZtYvh1 is required for hyphal growth. We next pinpointed that chlamydospore formation is a response to the intracellular osmotic stress generated by the heat stress. This intracellular stress stimulates the CWI and HOG MAPK pathways resulting in hyphal growth. If cell wall integrity is however compromised, ZtMsr1 represses the hyphal development program and might induce the chlamydospore-inducing genes as a stress-response survival strategy. Taken together, these results suggest a novel mechanism through which morphological transitions are orchestrated in Z. tritici - a mechanism possibly also present in other pleomorphic fungi.\n\nIMPORTANCETemperature is an environmental signal constantly monitored by pleomorphic fungi. Our experiments showed that yeast-to-hyphal or yeast-to-chlamydospore transitions are ubiquitous heat stress responses in Z. tritici. QTL mapping allowed us to identify a transcription factor and a protein phosphatase contributing to temperature-dependent morphogenesis. We showed that intracellular osmolarity is the pivotal signal inducing these transitions. We propose a regulatory network controlling Z. tritici morphogenesis, which may have broad implications for temperature sensing of fungal pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a recently identified RNA species with emerging functional roles as microRNA (miRNA) and protein sponges, regulators of gene transcription and translation, and as modulators of fundamental biological processes including immunoregulation. circRNAs have been found in a variety of species including plants, animals, and model genetic organisms such as the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Relevant to this study, circRNAs have recently been described in the parasitic nematode, Haemonchus contortus, suggesting they may have functionally important roles in parasites. Given this involvement in regulating biological processes, a better understanding of their role in parasites could be leveraged for future control efforts. Here, we report the use of next-generation sequencing to identify 1,997 distinct circRNAs expressed in adult female stages of the gastrointestinal parasitic nematode, Ascaris suum. We describe spatial expression in the ovaries and body wall muscle, and also report circRNA presence in extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted by the parasite into the external environment. Further, we used an in-silico approach to predict that a subset of Ascaris circRNAs bind both endogenous parasite miRNAs as well as human host miRNAs, suggesting they could be functional as both exogenous and endogenous miRNA sponges to alter gene expression. There was not a strong correlation between Ascaris circRNA length endogenous miRNA interactions, indicating Ascaris circRNAs are enriched for Ascaris miRNA binding sites, but that human miRNAs were predicted form a more thermodynamically stable bond with Ascaris circRNAs. These results suggest that secreted circRNAs could be interacting with host miRNAs at the host-parasite interface and influencing host gene transcription. Lastly, although we previously found that therapeutically relevant concentrations of the anthelmintic drug ivermectin inhibited EV release from parasitic nematodes, we did not observe a direct effect on Ascaris circRNAs expression or secretion.",

We show that DVM increases exponentially in sexual reproduction, while only linearly in asexual reproduction. Hence, sexual reproduction allows species more opportunity to adapt. We also show that DFM is bounded in sexual reproduction and OPM is inversely related to DFM. Thus, sexual reproduction leads to smaller DFM and hence a larger OPM.

    "abstract": "BackgroundComplex diseases have multifactorial etiologies making clinically actionable diagnostic markers difficult to identify. Novel tools with higher diagnostic yield and utility in driving personalized care are needed.\n\nMethodsWe utilized Illumina methylation array data from over 2400 samples to assess DNA methylation patterns in 20 distinct cell types ranging from sperm to brain as well as various disease states. We generated a simple analysis pipeline for DNA methylation data that focuses on intra-individual methylation variability within gene promoters. The analysis is designed, not to identify single causative gene alterations but instead focuses on any movement away from \"healthy\" methylation. This approach identifies altered regulation across multiple genes in related pathways thus enabling us to detect shifts in gene regulatory activity associated with distinct tissues and phenotypes. We explored three distinct questions in our assessment. 1) Are patterns of epigenetic variability tissue specific? 2) Do diseased tissues exhibit altered variability patterns compared to normal tissue? 3) Can epigenetic variability be detected in complex disease?\n\nResultsUnsupervised clustering analyses established that patterns of epigenetic variability are tissue specific and that these patterns are at least as predictive of tissue type as differential methylation analysis. We demonstrated the ability to use these patterns to differentiate between healthy and diseased tissue with unsupervised clustering even in cases of complex multifactorial diseases. We applied this method to the clinical use case of male infertility and found that men undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) with the lowest number of epigenetically dysregulated promoters in their sperm were almost twice as likely to father a child than men participating in IUI with the highest number of dysregulated promoters (p=0.011). We saw no significant difference in birth rates between groups of men with high and low numbers of dysregulated promoters undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF), indicating IVF as a better treatment than IUI to achieve live birth in the presence of multi-pathway dysregulation in sperm.\n\nConclusionsThis study demonstrates that patterns of epigenetic variability can differentiate between tissue types. While intuitive, this finding has never been demonstrated previously and suggests that specific epigenetic variability patterns may be used to predict phenotypic changes in disease states as these are, by definition, functional changes to cellular phenotypes. We demonstrate that the variability of gene regulatory marks are distinct between healthy and diseased tissue. This is particularly apparent at genes known to be important to cell function of the tissue of interest. While in some cases these regional alterations can be seen across the entire genome, more often the regulatory alterations that define a pathological phenotype are restricted to genes of known importance to a particular tissue. Importantly, in the case of sperm, we found that these patterns of variability did have utility in predicting infertile patients who would conceive through intrauterine insemination (IUI). We would propose that this discriminatory ability is due to the fact that the signature can be assessed in an n-of-1 context and that the patterns of variability identify any shift away from regulatory normalcy in pathways known to be impactful in the tissue of interest, and not only assessing the presence or absence of rare genetic variants. While the data presented here are encouraging, more work needs to be performed in other tissues to determine when, and in what context, these findings could be clinically actionable.",

Here we investigated performance of two animal opsins, mosquito Opn3 (MosOpn3) and lamprey parapinopsin (LamPP) in optical manipulation in vivo by using C. elegans. MosOpn3 introduced in a nociceptor neurons induced avoidance responses light-dependently with a retinal isomer ubiquitously present in every tissue, like ChR2 and unlike canonical vertebrate opsins. Remarkably, the sensitivity is ~7000 times higher than the case of ChR2 in the light-induced behavior. LamPP introduced in motor neurons induced violet light-dependent stop and green light-dependent go, demonstrating color-dependent manipulation of behaviors using LamPP. Furthermore, our molecular engineering extended the usability of MosOpn3 and LamPP to different signaling cascades and kinetics. Current findings demonstrated that the availability of two animal opsins is equivalent to that of ChR2 in terms of retinal requirement, providing solid strategies for GPCR optogenetics.",

We propose a model for SRT data that includes both continuous and discrete spatial variation in expression, and an algorithm, Belayer, to estimate the parameters of this model from layered tissues. Belayer models gene expression as a piecewise linear function of the relative depth of a tissue layer with possible discontinuities at layer boundaries. We use conformal maps to model relative depth and derive a dynamic programming algorithm to infer layer boundaries and gene expression functions. Belayer accurately identifies tissue layers and infers biologically meaningful spatially varying genes in SRT data from brain and skin tissue samples.",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has been a widely used high-throughput method to characterize transcriptomic dynamics spatiotemporally. However, typical RNA-seq data analysis pipelines depend on either a sequenced genome or corresponding reference transcripts or them both. This restriction makes the use of RNA-seq for species lacking both of sequenced genomes and corresponding reference transcripts challenging. Nile grass rat (Arvicanthis niloticus) is a diurnal rodent species with several unique characteristics making it as a useful model to study diet-induced type 2 diabetes and other physiological or behavioral processes due to its diurnal nature. However, there is neither a high-quality annotated Nile grass rat genome nor a reference transcript sets available so far, making it technically challenging to perform large-scale RNA-seq based transcriptomic studies. Although we are working on the first draft of Nile grass rat genome, a well annotated genome typically requires several rounds of manually reviewing curated transcripts and can take years to achieve. To solve this problem, we developed a Comparative RNA-Seq Pipeline (CRSP), integrating a comparative species strategy but not depending on a specific sequenced genome or species-matched reference transcripts. Benchmarking suggests the CRSP tool can achieve high accuracy to quantify gene expression levels. In this study, we generated the first ultra-deep (2.3 billion x 2 paired-end) Nile grass rat RNA-seq data from 59 biopsy samples representing 22 major organs, providing a unique resource and spatial gene expression reference for using Nile grass rat as a model to study human diseases. To facilitate a general use of CRSP, we also characterized the number of RNA-seq reads required for accurate estimation via simulation studies.

We compared three Aplysia neurons with varying capacity to generate plateau potentials: B51 with self-terminating plateaus, B64 with plateau potentials that do not self-terminate, and the regular spiking neuron B8. Our results indicate the three neurons expressed outward currents IA and ID, voltage-gated Ca2+ currents ICaL and ICaR, and persistent inward INaP. The most notable difference observed was a larger IA, ID, and IKCa currents in B8, and the plateau generating B64 did not express IKCa.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2r) from Guangdong and Guangxi pangolins have been implicated in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and future pandemics. We previously reported the culture of a SARS-CoV-2r GX_P2V from Guangxi pangolins. Here we report the GX_P2V isolate rapidly adapted to Vero cells by acquiring two genomic mutations: an alanine to valine substitution in the nucleoprotein and a 104-nucleotide deletion in the hypervariable region (HVR) of the 3-terminus untranslated region (3-UTR). We further report the characterization of the GX_P2V variant in in vitro and in vivo infection models. In cultured Vero and BGM cells, the GX_P2V variant produced minimal cell damage and small plaques. The GX_P2V variant infected golden hamsters and BALB/c mice but was highly attenuated. Golden hamsters infected intranasally had a short duration of productive infection. These productive infections induced neutralizing antibodies against pseudoviruses of GX_P2V and SARS-CoV-2. Collectively, our data show that the GX_P2V variant is highly attenuated in in vitro and in vivo infection models. Attenuation of the variant is likely due to the 104-nt deletion in the HVR in the 3-UTR. This study furthers our understanding of pangolin coronaviruses pathogenesis and provides novel insights for the design of live attenuated vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Candida albicans is the most common cause of human fungal infection, but the mechanisms of invasive pathogenesis remain poorly defined. Here we identify an unexpected mechanism: lipid-mediated immunosuppression. Through forward genetics, we found that C. albicans secretes a lipase, Lip2, that is critical for invasive disease. Murine infection with C. albicans strains that lack Lip2 display an exaggerated host IL-17 response that leads to fungal clearance from solid organs and host survival. IL-17 signaling is required for Lip2 action. The lipase activity of Lip2 inhibits IL-17 production indirectly through suppression of IL-23 production by tissue resident dendritic cells. We conclude that C. albicans suppresses antifungal IL-17 defense in solid organs by altering the tissue lipid milieu.",

    "abstract": "Type I interferon production and the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are key components of an innate immune response to many microbial pathogens. Dysregulation of this response can result in uncontrolled infection, inflammation, and autoimmune disease. Understanding the molecular mechanisms shaping the strength of type I interferon signaling may provide critical insights into infection control strategies and autoimmune disease therapies. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) is an intracellular pattern recognition receptor that acts as both a bacterial sensor protein and a mediator of antiviral responses. Antibacterial functions of NOD2 are enhanced by treatment with the small molecule inhibitor of pyrimidine biosynthesis N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA), though how this might function in the host antiviral response remains unknown. Therefore, we tested the ability of PALA to enhance NOD2-dependent antiviral responses. Alone, PALA treatment of macrophages was not sufficient to induce interferon {beta} (IFN{beta}) production or ISG expression. Instead, PALA synergized with IFN{beta} stimulation to enhance expression and activation of interferon-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) and induce the upregulation of a subset of ISGs in co-treated cells. Furthermore, PALA treatment of epithelial cells resulted in impaired viral replication of the herpesvirus, human cytomegalovirus. Induction of the PALA-enhanced antiviral response required activation of non-canonical NOD2 signaling mediated by mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and interferon response factor 1 (IRF1), rather than the classical receptor-interacting serine/threonine protein kinase 2 (RIP2) pathway or other IRFs previously reported to mediate NOD2 antiviral responses. These findings highlight pyrimidine metabolism enzymes as controllers of antimicrobial responses and suggest novel mechanisms for the modulation of type I interferon responses and antiviral activity.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the molecular mechanisms shaping the strength of type I interferon signaling may provide critical insights to improve infection control strategies and autoimmune disease therapies.

We have previously developed a scalable monolayer system to differentiate human embryonic stem cell (hESC) into mature skeletal muscle cells (SkMC) within 26 days without cell sorting or genetic manipulation. Here, building on our previous work, we show that differentiation and fusion of myotubes can be further enhanced using the anabolic factors testosterone (T) and follistatin (F) in combination with a cocktail of myokines (C). Importantly, combined TFC treatment significantly enhanced both hESC-SkMC fusion index and expression of various skeletal muscle markers including the motor protein Myosin Heavy Chain (MyHC). Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis revealed oxidative phosphorylation as the most up-regulated pathway and a significantly higher level of ATP and increased mitochondrial mass were also observed in TFC-treated hESC-SkMCs, suggesting enhanced energy metabolism is coupled to improved muscle differentiation. This cellular model will be a powerful tool for studying in vitro myogenesis and for drug discovery to further enhance muscle development or treat muscle diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundKnock-down resistance (kdr) mutations in the voltage gated sodium channel gene of Aedes species mosquitoes are biomarkers for resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. In the United States, few studies have reported kdr mutations among Aedes albopictus (family: Culicidae, order: Diptera, Skuse, 1895) populations. In this study we sought to explore the potential for permethrin-impregnated uniforms worn by military servicemembers to drive kdr emergence.\n\nMethods and ResultsWe collected 538 Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, including 156 from 4 sites at Fort Bragg (exposed), North Carolina and 382 from 15 sites in Wake County (control), North Carolina to compare the prevalence of kdr mutations. Of those successfully sequenced, we identified 12 (3.0%) mosquitoes with kdr mutations, all of which were attributed to variants at position 1534 within domain 3. All mutations were found in mosquitoes collected at Wake County sites; no mutations were identified at Fort Bragg. There was a focus of mutations observed at the Wake County sites with approximately 92% (11 of 12) of the mosquitoes with the mutation coming from one site, where kdr mutations represented 24.4% (11 of 45) of all mosquitoes collected.\n\nConclusionsOur study did not show any evidence that universal implementation of permethrin-impregnated uniforms drives the development of resistance. In contrast, we observed highly focal resistance in a suburban area of Raleigh, which may be attributable to peri-domestic mosquito control activities that involve area dispersal of pyrethroid insecticides. More robust surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence and spread of resistance.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYResistance to commonly employed insecticides among Aedes albopictus (family: Culicidae, order: Diptera, Skuse, 1895) mosquitoes poses as a substantial public health threat. In this study we sought to explore the potential for permethrin-impregnated uniforms worn by military servicemembers to drive emergence of resistance to pyrethroid insecticides by collecting and testing mosquitoes from both military and civilian sites. Overall, we did not identify mosquitoes harboring resistance at Ft. Bragg, but did find a focus of resistance in sub-urban Raleigh, which may be driven by commercial, peri-domestic mosquito control activities. These results suggest that resistance to pyrethroid insecticides may be more prevalent in the United States than previously known, but highly heterogenous. More robust surveillance is needed to monitor the emergence and spread of resistance.",

We sought genes that contribute to dominant forms of hereditary OA with the aim of identifying pathways whose activity level contributes to OA susceptibility. We found seven independent alleles affecting the NOD/RIPK2 pathway. To determine if altered signaling is sufficient to confer heightened OA susceptibility, mice carrying the OA-associated hyperactive Ripk2104Asp allele were generated. Knees of heterozygous Ripk2104Asp mice exhibit no overt signs of joint remodeling. Nevertheless, the mice respond to injury with markedly advanced post-traumatic OA. Uninjured heterozygous Ripk2104Asp mice appear primed to develop OA: their knees exhibit elevated NOD/RIPK2 pathway activity, localized inflammation, and altered expression of extracellular matrix genes linked to OA. In contrast to the joint, the mice display no evidence of systemic elevated inflammation. Elevated NOD/RIPK2 signaling confers vulnerability to OA.",

    "abstract": "The Hsp70 family of molecular chaperones is well-conserved and expressed in all organisms. In budding yeast, cells express four highly similar cytosolic Hsp70s Ssa1, 2, 3 and 4 which arose from gene duplication. Ssa1 and 2 are constitutively expressed while Ssa3 and 4 are induced upon heat shock. Recent evidence suggests that despite their amino acid similarity, these Ssas have unique roles in the cell. Here we examine the relative importance of Ssa1-4 in the regulation of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). We demonstrate that cells expressing either Ssa3 or Ssa4 as their sole Ssa are compromised for their resistance to DNA damaging agents and activation of DDR transcription. In addition, we show that the steady state levels and stability of RNR small subunits Rnr2 and Rnr4 are reduced in Ssa3 or Ssa4-expressing cells, a result of decreased Ssa-RNR interaction. Interaction between the Hsp70 co-chaperone Ydj1 and RNR is correspondingly decreased in cells only expressing Ssa3 and 4. Through studies of Ssa2/4 domain swap chimeras, we determined that the C-terminal domain of Ssas are the source of this functional specificity. Taking together, our work suggests a distinct role for Ssa paralogs in regulating DNA replication mediated by C-terminus sequence variation.\n\nAuthor SummaryCells require molecular chaperones to fold proteins into their active conformation. A major mystery however is why cells express so many highly-related and apparently redundant Hsp70 paralogs. We examined the role of four Hsp70 paralogs in budding yeast (Ssa1, 2, 3 and 4) on the activity of the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR complex). Importantly, we demonstrate there is selectivity of RNR subunits for Ssa1 and Ssa2 subunits, which is dictated by the co-chaperone Ydj1. Taken together, our work provides new insight into the functional specificity of Hsp70 paralogs using a native client protein.",

They can fail to determine the phase of variants, to capture multiple deletions and to cover the mitochondrial genome evenly. Long-read whole genome sequencing is prohibitively expensive for mtDNA heteroplasmy detection and often does not recapitulate the full mtDNA length.\n\nHere we describe a method to target, multiplex and sequence full-length, native single-molecule the human mitochondrial genome utilizing the RNA-guided DNA endonuclease Cas9. Combining Cas9 induced breaks as barcodes with long-read sequencing, we implemented a protocol in an optimal setting for both high or low integrity genomic DNA to target the circular mitochondrial genome with extremely high coverage. Our analytical pipeline efficiently detects single nucleotide heteroplasmy, physically determines phase and can accurately disentangle complex deletion patterns. This workflow is a unique tool for studying mtDNA variation in health and disease, and will accelerate mitochondrial research.",

    "abstract": "1This study investigated the impact of hyperoxic gas breathing (HYP) on repeated-sprint ability (RSA) and on the associated training load (TL). Thirteen team- and racquet-sport athletes performed 6-s all-out sprints with 24-s recovery until exhaustion (power decrement [&ge;] 15% for two consecutive sprints) under normoxic (NOR: FIO2 0.21) and hyperoxic (HYP: FiO2 0.40) conditions in a randomized, single-blind and crossover design. The following variables were recorded throughout the tests: mechanical indices, arterial O2 saturation (SpO2), oxygenation of the vastus lateralis muscle with near-infrared spectroscopy, and electromyographic activity of the vastus lateralis, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius lateralis muscles. Session TL (work x rate of perceived exertion) and neuromuscular efficiency (work/EMG) were calculated. Compared with NOR, HYP increased SpO2 (2.7 {+/-} 0.8%, Cohens effect size ES 0.55), the number of sprints (14.5 {+/-} 8.6%, ES 0.28), the total mechanical work (13.6 {+/-} 6.8%, ES 0.30) and the session TL (19.4 {+/-} 7.0%, ES 0.33). Concomitantly, HYP increased the amplitude of muscle oxygenation changes during sprints (25.2 {+/-} 11.7%, ES 0.36) and recovery periods (26.1 {+/-} 11.4%, ES 0.37), as well as muscle recruitment (9.9 {+/-} 12.1%, ES 0.74) and neuromuscular efficiency (6.9 {+/-} 9.0%, ES 0.24). We conclude that breathing a hyperoxic mixture enriched to 40% O2 improves the total work performed and the associated training load during an open-loop RSA session in trained athletes. This ergogenic impact may be mediated by metabolic and neuromuscular alterations.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of the immune response to Salmonella typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infection is a complex process, influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Different inbred mouse strains show distinct levels of resistance to S. Typhimurium infection, ranging from susceptible (e.g., C57BL/6J) to resistant (e.g., DBA/2J) strains. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms contributing to the host response remain elusive. In this study, we present a comprehensive proteomics profiling of the spleen tissue from C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains with different doses of S. Typhimurium infection by tandem tag mass coupled with two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We identified and quantified 3,986 proteins, resulting in 475 differentially expressed proteins between C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the mechanisms of innate immune responses to S. Typhimurium infection are associated with several signaling pathways, including the interferon signaling pathway. Our proteomic data also discovered a plausible gene in a genomic region that control different levels of resistance to S. Typhimurium infection. We further revealed the roles of macrophage cells and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the mechanisms under the natural resistance to S. Typhimurium. In summary, our results provide new insights into the genetic regulation of the immune response to S. Typhimurium infection in mice.\n\nAuthor SummarySalmonella infection (salmonellosis) is a common zoonotic disease that mainly propagates through contaminated food and drink. Various mouse strains display prominent disparities in responses to Salmonella invasion. Elucidating the heterogeneous immune reactions between different mouse strains can shed light on the fundamental molecular mechanisms of the innate immune system. Here, we employed a combination of proteomics and systems biology approaches to provide an unprecedented panorama of the inextricably interlaced immune signaling pathways in response to Salmonella infection in mice. Our results revealed the dynamics of cell signaling molecules elicited by inflammation and established new connections among them. We also identified a new candidate gene involved in the combat with pathogens. Our proteomic data and results contribute to understanding the intricate interactions of immune responses to Salmonella infection from molecular to systemic levels.",

    "abstract": "The MCM2-7 hetero-hexamer is the replicative DNA helicase that plays a central role in eukaryotic DNA replication. In proliferating cells, the expression level of the MCM2-7 hexamer is kept high, which safeguards the integrity of the genome. However, how the MCM2-7 hexamer is assembled in living cells remains unknown. Here, we revealed that the MCM-binding protein (MCMBP) plays a critical role in the assembly of this hexamer in human cells. MCMBP associates with MCM3 which is essential for maintaining the level of the MCM2-7 hexamer. Acute depletion of MCMBP demonstrated that it contributes to MCM2-7 assembly using nascent MCM3. Cells depleted of MCMBP gradually ceased to proliferate because of reduced replication licensing. Under this condition, p53-positive cells exhibited arrest in the G1 phase, whereas p53-null cells entered the S phase and lost their viability because of the accumulation of DNA damage, suggesting that MCMBP is a potential target for killing p53-deficient cancers.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that play essential roles in cell growth and survival. Processes of fission and fusion are critical for distribution, segregation and maintenance of mitochondria and their genomes (mtDNA). While recent work has revealed the significance of mitochondrial organization for mtDNA maintenance, impact of mtDNA perturbations on mitochondrial dynamics remains less understood. Here we develop a tool to induce mitochondria-specific DNA damage, using a mitochondrial-targeted base modifying bacterial toxin, DarT. Following damage, we observe dynamic reorganization of mitochondrial networks, likely driven by mitochondrial dysfunction. Changes in organization are associated with loss of mtDNA, independent of mitophagy. Unexpectedly, perturbation to exonuclease function of mtDNA replicative polymerase, Mip1, results in rapid loss of mtDNA. Our data suggest that, under damage, partitioning of defective mtDNA and organelle are de-coupled, with emphasis on mitochondrial segregation independent of its DNA. Together, our works underscores the importance of genome maintenance on mitochondrial function, that can act as a modulator of organelle organization and segregation.",

    "abstract": "Rangelands support many important ecosystem services and are highly sensitive to climate change. Understanding temporal dynamics in rangeland gross primary production (GPP) and how it may change under projected climate change, including more frequent and severe droughts, is critical for ranching communities to cope with future changes. Covering ~10% of Californias climatologically and topographically diverse landscapes, annual rangelands express varying sensitivity to precipitation fluctuation and warming. Herein, we examined how climate regulates temporal dynamics of annual GPP in Californias annual rangeland across scales, based on 20 years of satellite record derived GPP at 500-meter resolution since 2001. We built gradient boosted regression tree models for 23 ecoregion subsections in our study area, relating annual GPP with 30 climatic variables and disentangling the partial dependence of GPP on each climate variable. Our analysis showed that GPP was most sensitive to growing season precipitation amount; GPP decrease as much as 200 g C/m2/yr when growing season precipitation decreased from 400 to 100 mm/yr in one of the driest subsections. We also found that years with more evenly distributed growing season precipitation had higher GPP. Warmer winter minimum air temperature enhanced GPP in approximately two-thirds of the subsections. In contrast, average growing season mean and maximum air temperatures showed a negative relationship with annual GPP. When forced by downscaled future climate projections, changes in future rangeland productivity at the ecoregion subsection scale were more remarkable than at the state level; this suggests rangeland productivity responses to climate change will be highly variable at the local level. Further, we found large uncertainty in precipitation projections among the four climate models used in this study. Specifically, drier models predicted a larger degree of reduction in GPP, especially in drier subsections. Our machine learning-based analysis highlights key regional differences in GPP vulnerability to climate and provides insights into the intertwining and potentially counteracting effects of seasonal temperature and precipitation regimes. This work demonstrates the potential of using remote sensing to enhance field-based rangeland monitoring and, combined with machine learning, to inform adaptive management and conservation within the context of weather extremes and climate change.",

Few studies have explored whether identifying CpG subsets based on biological and statistical properties can maximise predictions while minimising array content.\n\nMethodsVariance component analyses and penalised regression (epigenetic predictors) were used to test the influence of (i) the number of CpGs considered, (ii) mean CpG methylation variability and (iii) methylation QTL status on the variance captured in eighteen traits by blood DNA methylation. Training and test sets comprised [&le;]4,450 and [&le;]2,578 unrelated individuals from Generation Scotland, respectively.\n\nResultsAs the number of CpG sites under consideration decreased, so too did the estimates from the variance components and prediction analyses. Methylation QTL status and mean CpG variability did not influence variance components. However, relative effect sizes were 15% larger for epigenetic predictors based on CpGs with methylation QTLs compared to sites without methylation QTLs. Relative effect sizes were 45% larger for predictors based on CpGs with mean beta-values between 10%-90% compared to those using hypo- or hypermethylated CpGs (beta-value [&le;]10% or [&ge;]90%).\n\nConclusionArrays with fewer CpGs could reduce costs, leading to increased sample sizes for analyses.

While many pathogenic drivers have been described in AML, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating chemotherapy resistance remains poor. Therefore, we sought to identify resistance genes to induction therapy in AML and elucidated ALOX5 as a novel mediator of resistance to anthracycline based therapy. ALOX5 is transcriptionally upregulated in AML patient blasts in comparison to normal hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) and ALOX5 mRNA, and protein expression is increased in response to induction therapy. In vitro, and in vivo genetic, and pharmacologic perturbation studies confirm that ALOX5 positively regulates the leukemogenic potential of AML LSCs, and its loss does not significantly affect the function of normal HSPCs.

Computational tools, based on classic machine learning, have been successful at predicting PPIs in silico, but the lack of consistent and reliable frameworks for this task has led to network models that are difficult to compare and discrepancies between algorithms that remain unexplained. To better understand the underlying inference mechanisms that underpin these models, we designed an open-source framework for benchmarking that accounts for a range of biological and statistical pitfalls while facilitating reproducibility. We use it to shed light on the impact of network topology and how different algorithms deal with highly connected proteins. By studying functional genomics-based and sequence-based models on human PPIs, we show their complementarity as the former performs best on lone proteins while the latter specialises in interactions involving hubs. We also show that algorithm design has little impact on performance with functional genomic data. We replicate our results between both human and S. cerevisiae data and demonstrate that models using functional genomics are better suited to PPI prediction across species. With rapidly increasing amounts of sequence and functional genomics data, our study provides a principled foundation for future construction, comparison and application of PPI networks.",
