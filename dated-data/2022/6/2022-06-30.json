    "abstract": "Efferent neurons are believed to play essential roles in maintaining auditory function. The lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons, which project from the brainstem to the inner ear where they release multiple transmitters including peptides, catecholamines and acetylcholine, are the most numerous yet least understood elements of efferent control of the cochlea. Using in vitro calcium imaging and patch-clamp recordings, we found that LOC neurons in juvenile and young adult mice exhibited extremely slow waves of activity (~0.1 Hz). These seconds-long bursts of Na+ spikes were driven by an intrinsic oscillator dependent on L-type Ca2+ channels, and were not observed in prehearing mice, suggesting an age-dependent mechanism underlying the intrinsic oscillator. Using optogenetic approaches, we identified both ascending (cochlear nucleus) and descending (auditory cortex) sources of synaptic excitation, as well as the synaptic receptors used for such excitation. Additionally, we identified potent inhibition originating in the glycinergic medial nucleus of trapezoid body (MNTB). Conductance-clamp experiments revealed an unusual mechanism of electrical signaling in LOC neurons, in which synaptic excitation and inhibition served to switch on and off the intrinsically generated spike burst mechanism, allowing for prolonged periods of activity or silence controlled by brief synaptic events. Protracted bursts of action potentials may be essential for effective exocytosis of the diverse transmitters released by LOC fibers in the cochlea.\n\nSignificance StatementThe lateral olivocochlear (LOC) neurons, being the most abundant auditory efferent control of the ear, remained largely unexplored. Here we reported that LOC neurons displayed patterned electrical activity at an unusually slow pace (~0.1 Hz), mediated by a calcium-dependent intrinsic oscillator. This is surprising given the speed and precision were believed to be the currency of signaling in the lower auditory system. Optogenetic experiments determined the glutamatergic and glycinergic sources of synaptic inputs to these neurons, while conductance-clamp experiments revealed that synaptic activity acts like switches for turning on or off prolonged spike activity driven by the intrinsic oscillator. This extended spike activity may be essential for effective exocytosis of the diverse transmitters released by LOC fibers in the cochlea.",

    "abstract": "The central circadian regulator within the suprachiasmatic nucleus transmits time of day information by a diurnal spiking rhythm that is driven by intrinsic activity of molecular clock genes controlling membrane excitability. Most brain regions, including the hippocampus, harbor similar intrinsic circadian transcriptional machinery but whether these molecular programs generate oscillations of membrane properties is unexplored. Here, we show that intrinsic excitability of mouse dentate granule neurons exhibits a 24-hour oscillation that controls spiking probability. Diurnal changes in excitability are mediated by antiphase G-protein regulation of potassium and sodium conductances to reduce excitability during the light phase. Disruption of the circadian transcriptional machinery by conditional deletion of Bmal1 enhances excitability selectively during the light phase, increasing engram recruitment and spatial discrimination memory. These results reveal that circadian transcriptional machinery regulates intrinsic excitability, highlighting the role of cell-autonomous oscillations in hippocampal function and behavior.\n\nHighlightsDentate neurons exhibit a 24-hour oscillation of excitability with low excitability during the Light phase\n\nReduced excitability results from G-protein regulation of passive and active properties\n\nBmal1 deletion disrupts G-protein regulation to enhance excitability during the Light\n\nBmal1 deletion enhances the size of memory engrams and spatial discrimination",

    "abstract": "Leptospirosis, a neglected bacterial zoonosis, is a global public health issue disproportionately affecting impoverished communities such as urban slums in the developing world. A variety of animal species, including peridomestic rodents and dogs, can be infected with different strains of leptospirosis. Humans contract leptospirosis via exposure to water or soil contaminated with the urine of infected animals. Due to the unavailability of safe and effective vaccines, preventive strategies mainly focus on minimizing human exposure to contaminated environment. In marginalized communities, this approach is ineffective due to infrastructure deficiencies and the difficulties in implementing sanitation and hygiene practices. Moreover, continuing expansion of urban slums worldwide will likely contribute to the increase in outbreaks of leptospirosis. Effective prevention of leptospirosis outbreaks will therefore require a thorough understanding of Leptospira transmission dynamics in impoverished, high-density settings. We developed the agent-based model MHMSLeptoDy to investigate Leptospira dynamics in a realistic, in silico high-density community of rodents, dogs, and human hosts, and two host-adapted Leptospira strains. Virtual explorations using MHMSLeptoDy were undertaken to evaluate alternate interventions and to assess the zoonotic transmission risk of leptospirosis. A key finding from model explorations is that rodents are the main contributors of rodent-adapted as well as dog-adapted strains in the environment, while dogs play an important role in distributing the rodent-adapted strain. Assessment of alternate leptospirosis control strategies using model iterations revealed that dog vaccination and rodent control interventions had the most impact on lowering human outbreak probability. Our open-source, customizable agent-based model provides a sophisticated mechanism to quantitatively evaluate nuanced intervention strategies and inform the design of rational, locally relevant leptospirosis control programs.",

    "abstract": "Following the breakthrough of immune check point inhibitors (ICIs), a new era of immuno-oncology agents has emerged and established immunotherapy as a part of cancer treatment. Despite the improving outcomes of ICIs, many patients with initial response are known to develop acquired resistance later. There is increasing interest in utilizing other stimulatory means, such as anti-pathogen immune responses to induce anti-tumor immune responses. The immunostimulatory effects of anti-pathogen-treated tumors in combinations with ICI are known to potentially amplify anti-tumor immunity resulting in increased tumor responses and improved outcomes. Anti-pathogen-treated tumors can become immune-infiltrated \"hot\" tumors and demonstrate higher treatment response rates and improved survival. Our research group has previously demonstrated that tumors can be converted from \"cold\" to \"hot\" by intratumoral injection of a commercially available seasonal influenza vaccine. In continuation with our work, in deciphering the role of anti-viral immunity in the context of tumor immunology, we studied the role of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 virus as anti-tumor agent. Here we report that intratumoral injections of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 convert the immunologically cold tumors to hot by generating anti-tumor-mediated CD8+ T cells. Our findings suggest that inactivated SARS-CoV-2 can be used as an immune modulator in immunotherapy for melanoma and triple-negative breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Why are people with focal epilepsy not constantly seizing? Previous molecular work has implicated gamma-aminobutyric acid balance as integral to seizure generation and termination, but is the high-level distributed brain network involved in suppressing seizures? Recent intracranial electrographic evidence has suggested that seizure onset zones have an increased inward connectivity. Accordingly, we hypothesize that seizure onset zones are actively suppressed by the rest of the brain network during interictal states.\n\nWe tested this hypothesis on 81 subjects with drug resistant focal epilepsy undergoing presurgical evaluation. We utilized intracranial electrographic resting-state and neurostimulation recordings to evaluate the network connectivity of seizure onset, propagative, and non-involved regions. We then utilized diffusion imaging to acquire estimates of white matter connectivity to evaluate structure-function coupling effects on connectivity findings. Finally, using our observations, we generated a resting-state classification model to assist clinicians in detecting seizure onset and propagative zones without the need for multiple ictal recordings.\n\nOur findings indicate that seizure onset and propagative zones demonstrate markedly increased inward connectivity and decreased outward connectivity on both resting-state and neurostimulation analyses. When controlling for distance between regions, the difference between inward vs. outward connectivity remained stable up to 80 mm between brain connections. Structure-function coupling analyses revealed that seizure onset zones exhibit abnormally enhanced coupling (hypercoupling) of surrounding regions compared to presumably healthy tissue. Using these observations, our classification models achieved a maximum held-out testing set accuracy of 92.0{+/-}2.2%.\n\nThese results indicate that seizure onset zones are actively segregated and suppressed by a widespread brain network. Furthermore, this electrographically observed functional suppression is disproportionate to any observed structural connectivity alterations of the seizure onset zones. These findings have implications for the identification of seizure onset zones using only brief resting-sate recordings to reduce patient morbidity and augment the presurgical evaluation of drug resistant epilepsy. Furthermore, testing of the interictal suppression hypothesis can provide insight into potential new resective, ablative, and neuromodulation approaches to improve surgical success rates in those suffering from drug resistant focal epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) continue to cause disease and impair the effectiveness of treatments. The therapeutic potential of convergent neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) from fully recovered patients has been explored in several early stages of novel drugs. Here, we identified initially elicited NAbs (Ig Heavy, Ig lambda, Ig kappa) in response to COVID-19 infection in patients admitted to the intensive care unit at a single center with deep RNA sequencing (>100 million reads) of peripheral blood as a diagnostic tool for predicting the severity of the disease and as a means to pinpoint specific compensatory NAb treatments. Clinical data were prospectively collected at multiple time points during ICU admission, and amino acid sequences for the NAb CDR3 segments were identified. Patients who survived severe COVID-19 had significantly more of a Class 3 antibody (C135) to SARS-CoV-2 compared to non-survivors (16,315 reads vs 1,412 reads, p=0.02). In addition to highlighting the utility of RNA sequencing in revealing unique NAb profiles in COVID-19 patients with different outcomes, we provided a physical basis for our findings via atomistic modeling combined with molecular dynamics simulations. We established the interactions of the Class 3 NAb C135 with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, proposing a mechanistic basis for inhibition via multiple conformations that can effectively prevent ACE2 from binding to the spike protein, despite C135 not directly blocking the ACE2 binding motif. Overall, we demonstrate that deep RNA sequencing combined with structural modeling offers the new potential to identify and understand novel therapeutic(s) NAbs in individuals lacking certain immune responses due to their poor endogenous production. Our results suggest a possible window of opportunity for administration of such NAbs when their full sequence becomes available. A method involving rapid deep RNA sequencing of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 or its variants at the earliest infection time could help to develop personalized treatments using the identified specific NAbs.",

Upon interaction with CD4, Env adopts more \"open\" conformations, exposing ADCC epitopes. HIV-1 limits Env-CD4 interaction and protects infected cells against ADCC by downregulating CD4 via Nef, Vpu and Env. Limited data exists however of the role of these proteins in downmodulating CD4 on infected macrophages and how this impacts Env conformation. While Nef, Vpu and Env are all required to efficiently downregulate CD4 on infected CD4+T cells, we show here that any one of these proteins is sufficient to downmodulate most CD4 from the surface of infected macrophages. Consistent with this finding, Nef and Vpu have a lesser impact on Env conformation and ADCC sensitivity in infected macrophages compared to CD4+T cells.

For the present study, we isolated natural strains vertically transmitted through three generations and proceeded to study their molecular mechanism of VT. No parasitemia was detected in immunocompetent mice, but they were able to induce an immune response and colonize different organs. VT experiments revealed that infection with the different strains did not affect mating, pregnancy or resorptions, but despiting low parasitemia, VT strains reached the placenta and resulted in higher vertical transmission rates than strains of either moderate or high virulence. While the virulent strain modulated more than 2500 placental genes, VT strains modulated 150, and none of the modulated genes is shared between them. VT strains downregulate genes associated with cell division and replication and upregulate immunomodulatory genes leading to anti-inflammatory responses and tolerance. The virulent strain stimulates a strong pro-inflammatory immune response, and this molecular footprint correlated with histopathological analyses. We herein describe a unique placental response regarding the passage of T cruzi VT isolates across the maternal-fetal interphase, challenging the current knowledge derived mainly from studies of laboratory-adapted or highly virulent strains.",

    "abstract": "The sulfonamides (sulfas) are the oldest class of synthetic antibacterial that target the essential, conserved dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) enzyme, encoded by folP, through chemical mimicry of its substrate p-aminobenzoic acid (pABA). Resistance has complicated their clinical utility and is widespread in pathogenic species. Resistance is mediated by acquisition of sul genes on mobile genetic elements, which code for the so-called Sul enzymes that are divergent DHPS enzymes with intrinsic sulfa-insensitivity. Even decades after the discovery of this resistance mechanism, its molecular details have not been understood. In this study, we elucidate the molecular basis for intrinsic resistance of Sul enzymes using x-ray crystallography, enzymology, mutagenesis, intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence, antibiotic susceptibility of a contemporary {Delta}folP strain, and adaptive laboratory evolution of folP. We show that the active sites of Sul enzymes possess a modified pABA-interaction region based on insertion of a Phe-Gly sequence. This insertion is necessary for discrimination between pABA and sulfonamides, more than 1000-fold loss in binding affinity of sulfas to Sul enzymes, and robust pan-sulfonamide resistance. We detect no fitness cost due to this active site modification, as it does not compromise the rate of dihydropteroate biosynthesis and complements the thymidine-auxotrophy of an E. coli folP deletion strain. Lab-evolved sulfa-resistance folP recapitulated this mechanism through the same active site insertion. Finally, we show that this insertion and a nearby loop confer increased active site flexibility of Sul enzymes relative to DHPS. These results provide a molecular foundation for revisiting DHPS-targeted antibacterials to evade resistance.",

    "abstract": "Clostridia are a polyphyletic group of Gram-positive, spore-forming anaerobes in the Firmicutes phylum that significantly impact metabolism and functioning of human gastrointestinal tract. Recently, Clostridia were divided into two separate classes, Clostridia and Erysipelotrichia, based on phenotypic and 16S rRNA gene-based differences. While Clostridia include many well-known pathogenic bacteria, Erysipelotrichia remain relatively uncharacterized, particularly regarding their role as a pathogen vs. commensal. Despite wide recognition as a commensal, the Erysipelotrichial species, Clostridium innocuum, has recently been associated with various disease states. To further understand the ecological and potential virulent role of C. innocuum, we conducted a genomic comparison across 38 C. innocuum isolates and 75 publicly available genomes. Based on colony morphology, we isolated multiple C. innocuum cultivars from the feces of healthy human volunteers (n=5). Comparison of the 16S rRNA gene of our isolates against publicly available microbiota datasets in healthy individuals suggests a high prevalence of C. innocuum across the human population (> 80%). Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across core genes and average nucleotide identify (ANI) revealed the presence of 4 clades among all available unique genomes (n=108 total). Investigation of carbohydrate and protein utilization pathways, including comparison against the carbohydrate-activating-enzyme (CAZyme) database, demonstrated inter-and intra-clade differences that were further substantiated in vitro. Collectively, these data indicate genetic variance within the C. innocuum species that may help clarify its role in human disease and health.\n\nIMPORTANCEClostridia are a group of medically important anaerobes as both commensals and pathogens. Recently, a new class of Erysipelotrichia containing a number of re-assigned Clostridial species has emerged, including Clostridium innocuum. Recent studies have implicated C. innocuum as a potential causative agent of diarrhea in patients from whom Clostridioides difficile could not be isolated. Using genomic and in vitro comparison, this study sought to characterize C. innocuum in the healthy human gut. Our analyses suggest that C. innocuum is a highly prevalent and diverse species, demonstrating clade-specific differences in metabolism and potential virulence. Collectively, this study is the first investigation into a broader description of C. innocuum as a human gut inhabitant.",

There are numerous P. aeruginosa lifestyle changes associated with chronic biofilm infection cued by the CF lung environment. These include a loss of virulence, metabolic changes, and increased antimicrobial tolerance. We have investigated P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilm infection over 7 d in an ex vivo pig lung (EVPL) model for CF, previously shown to facilitate formation of a clinically-relevant P. aeruginosa biofilm structure with gene expression comparable to human infection. We extracted and sequenced P. aeruginosa RNA from EVPL-associated biofilms 24 h, 48 h, and 7 d after infection, and compared gene expression between sequential time points. We also investigated tolerance to polymyxins across these three time points. Our results indicate that the EVPL model can maintain a P. aeruginosa biofilm population, which exhibits increased antibiotic tolerance, for at least 7 d. Differential expression of antimicrobial resistance-associated genes was not observed, however there was significant upregulation of sulfur metabolism and phenazine biosynthesis-related genes, as well as maintenance of a structured biofilm. These findings provide further insight into the incidence of increased P. aeruginosa antibiotic tolerance during infection of the CF lung, and the gene expression changes that arise as chronic infection establishes.",

To define the types of glycoconjugates that facilitate IAV infection, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 technique to truncate different types of glycoconjugates, either individually or in combination, by targeting glycosyltransferases essential to glycan biosynthesis in a human lung epithelial cell line. Our studies show that both human and avian IAV strains do not display strict preferences for a specific type of glycoconjugate. Interestingly, truncation of all three types of glycoconjugates significantly decreased the replication of human IAV strains, yet did not impact the replication of avian IAV strains. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that avian IAV strains utilize a broader repertoire of glycoconjugates for host cell infection as compared to human IAV strains.\n\nAuthor SummaryIt is well known that influenza A viruses (IAV) initiate host cell infection by binding to sialic acid, a sugar molecule present at the ends of various sugar chains called glycoconjugates. These glycoconjugates can vary in chain length, structure, and composition. However, it remains unknown if IAV strains preferentially bind to sialic acid on specific glycoconjugates for host cell infection. Here, we utilized CRISPR gene editing to abolish sialic acid on different glycoconjugate types in human lung cells, and evaluated human versus avian IAV infections. Our studies show that both human and avian IAV strains can infect human lung cells by utilizing any of the three major sialic acid-containing glycoconjugate types, specifically N-glycans, O-glycans, and glycolipids. Interestingly, simultaneous elimination of sialic acid on all three glycoconjugate types in human lung cells dramatically decreased human IAV infection, yet had little effect on avian IAV infection. Our studies indicate that avian IAV strains can utilize a wide variety of glycoconjugates for infection, whereas human IAV strains display restrictions in glycoconjugate type usage. These novel studies show distinct differences in host glycoconjugate preferences between human and avian IAV strains.",

    "abstract": "Lambdoid (or Lambda-like) phages, are a group of related temperate phages that can infect Escherichia coli and other gut bacteria. A key characteristic of these phages is their mosaic genome structure which served as basis for the \"modular genome hypothesis\". Accordingly, lambdoid phages evolve by transferring genomic regions, each of which constitutes a functional unit. Nevertheless, it is unknown which genes are preferentially transferred together and what drives such co-transfer events. Here we aim to characterize genome modularity by studying co-transfer of genes among 95 distantly related lambdoid (pro-)phages. Based on gene content, we observed that the genomes cluster into twelve groups, which are characterized by a highly similar gene content within the groups and highly divergent gene content across groups. Highly similar proteins can occur in genomes of different groups, indicating that they have been transferred. About 26% of homologous protein clusters in the four known operons (i.e., the early left, early right, immunity, and late operon) engage in gene transfer, which affects all operons to a similar extent. We identified pairs of genes that are frequently co-transferred and observed that these pairs tend to be in close proximity to one another on the genome. We find that frequently co-transferred genes are involved in related functions and highlight interesting examples involving structural proteins, the CI repressor and Cro regulator, proteins interacting with DNA, and membrane-interacting proteins. We conclude that epistatic effects, where the functioning of one protein depends on the presence of another, plays an important role in the evolution of the modular structure of these genomes.\n\nData summaryThe genomes used in this research are publicly available (Table S1). All supporting data is available in supplementary tables. Source code and documentation to calculate GRR is available under GPLv2 (https://github.com/annecmg/GRRpair).\n\nImpact statementTemperate phages, viruses that can integrate their own genetic material into bacterial genomes, are pervasive mobile genetic elements that can influence bacterial fitness in manifold ways. The E. coli phage lambda has been a model phage of molecular biology for decades. Lambdoid phages are highly prevalent in Enterobacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella, have a mosaic-like genome, the same genome architecture as lambda, and can recombine with phage lambda. Nevertheless, these phages can be very distinct, and no lambdoid core genome exits. Although lambdoid phage genomes have been studied for decades, we know relatively little about how they evolve. Early observations led to the modular genome hypothesis, according to which, phages are assemblages of genetic modules. But what determines the structure of these modules and which genes do preferentially occur together in modules? In this study, we provide answers to these questions using a novel computational approach that allows to infer gene transfer events between distantly related phages despite the absence of a core genome.\n\nWe find that co-transfer of functionally related genes is frequent during the evolution of lambdoid phages. This suggests epistatic interactions among these genes, i.e., the co-transferred genes likely need to function together to ensure a viable phage. A prime example is the co-transfer of structural genes, such as genes encoding for the phage capsid or the phage tail. Additionally, we also find co-transfer of known interacting regulatory genes and co-transfer between functionally related genes that have so far been unknown to interact. Together, our analysis provides novel insights into the evolution of temperate phages. Moreover, our approach, which allows to identify gene transfer in the absence of a core phylogeny might be valuable for studying the evolution of other fast-evolving genomes, including viruses of other hosts.",

    "abstract": "Probiotics have been suggested as nutritional supplements to improve gastrointestinal health. However, the probiotics marketed today only colonize the densely populated gut to a limited extent. Bacteriophages comprise the majority of viruses in the human gut virome and there are strong indications that they play important roles in shaping the gut microbiome (GM). Here we investigate the use of fecal virome transplantation (FVT) as a mean to alter GM composition to lead the way for persistent colonization of two types of probiotics: Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) representing a well-established probiotic and Akkermansia muciniphila (AKM) representing a putative next-generation probiotic. Male and female C57BL/6NTac mice were cohoused in pairs at 4 weeks of age and received the following treatment by oral gavage at week 5 and 6: AKM+FVT, probiotic sham (Pro-sham)+FVT, LGG+Saline, AKM+Saline, and control (Pro-sham+Saline). The FVT originated from donor mice with high relative abundance of A. muciniphila. All animals were terminated at age 9 weeks. The FVT treatment did not increase the relative abundance of the administered LGG or AKM in the recipient mice. Instead FVT significantly (p<0.05) increased the abundance of naturally occurring A. muciniphila compared to the control. This highlights the potential of stimulating the commensal \"probiotics\" that already are permanent members of the gut. Being co-housed male and female, a fraction of the female mice became pregnant. Unexpectedly, the FVT treated mice were found to have a significantly (p<0.05) higher fertility rate independent of probiotic administration. These preliminary observations urge for follow-up studies investigating GM/fertility interactions.",

    "abstract": "Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) induce p53-dependent apoptosis in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). To interrogate this phenomenon, a rationally designed ITR (SynITR), deleted for p53 binding sites was evaluated for vector production and gene delivery. While SynITR genomes were decreased for transgenic genome replication compared to wtITRs, similar production titers indicated that replication is not rate-limiting. Packaged in the AAV2 capsid, wtITR and SynITR vectors demonstrated similar transduction efficiencies of human cell lines with no differences in reporter kinetics. Following rAAV2-wtITR infection of hESCs, rapid apoptosis was observed, in contrast, rAAV2-SynITR infection resulted in attenuated hESC toxicity with cells retaining their differentiation potential. While hESC particle entry and double stranded circular episomes was similar for the ITR contexts, reporter expression was significantly inhibited from transduced SynITR genomes. Infection of hESCs induced {gamma}H2AX in an ITR-independent manner, however, canonical activation of p53 was uncoupled using rAAV-SynITR. Further hESC investigations revealed 2 additional novel findings: i) p53{beta} is uniquely and constitutively active, and ii) rAAV infection, independent of the ITR sequence, induces activation of p53{psi}. The data herein reveal an ITR-dependent rAAV transduction restriction specific to hESCs and manipulation of the DNA damage response via ITR engineering.",

    "abstract": "Dimerization of the thrombopoietin receptor (TpoR) is necessary for receptor activation and downstream signaling through activated Janus kinase 2. We have shown previously that different orientations of the transmembrane (TM) helices within a receptor dimer can lead to different signaling outputs. Here we addressed the structural basis of activation for receptor mutations S505N and W515K that induce myeloproliferative neoplasms. We show using in vivo bone marrow reconstitution experiments that ligand-independent activation of TpoR by TM asparagine (Asn) substitutions is proportional to the proximity of the mutation to the intracellular membrane surface. Solid-state NMR experiments on TM peptides indicate a progressive loss of helical structure in the juxtamembrane (JM) R/KWQFP motif with either proximity of Asn substitutions to the cytosolic boundary or mutation of W515 in the motif. Mutational studies in the TpoR cytosolic JM region show that the helical loss by itself can induce activation, but is localized to a maximum of 6 amino acids downstream of W515, the rest of the region until Box 1 requiring helicity for receptor function. The constitutive activation of TpoR mutants S505N and W515K can be inhibited by rotation of TM helices within the TpoR dimer, which also restores helicity around W515. Together these data allow us to develop a general model for activation and to explain the critical role of the JM W515 residue in the regulation of receptor activity.\n\n(Total manuscript without References and Figure Legends 6507 words, main text (without methods and materials):)",

    "abstract": "Lysosomes are an important organelle required for the degradation of a range of cellular components. Lysosome function is critical for development and homeostasis as dysfunction can lead to inherited genetic disorders, cancer, and neurodegenerative and metabolic disease. The acidic and protease-rich environment of lysosomes poses experimental challenges. Many fluorescent proteins are quenched or degraded, while specific red fluorescent proteins can be cleaved from translational fusion partners and accumulate. While studying MLT-11, a C. elegans molting factor that localizes to lysosomes and the cuticle, we sought to optimize several experimental parameters. We found that, in contrast to mNeonGreen fusions, mScarlet fusions to MLT-11 missed cuticular and rectal epithelial localization. Rapid sample lysis and denaturation was critical for preventing MLT-11 fragmentation while preparing lysates for western blots. Using a model lysosomal substrate (NUC-1) we found that rigid polyproline linkers and truncated mCherry constructs do not prevent cleavage of mCherry from NUC-1. We provide evidence that extended localization in lysosomal environments prevents the detection of FLAG epitopes in western blots. Finally, we optimize an acid-tolerant green fluorescent protein (Gamillus) for use in C. elegans. These experiments provide important experimental considerations and new reagents for the study of C. elegans lysosomal proteins.",

Here, we have characterized the functional diversification of the Protein kinase R (PKR), a major antiviral innate defense system. Our data indicate that PKR has evolved under positive selection and has undergone repeated genomic duplications in bats, in contrast to all studied mammals that possess a single copy of the gene. Functional testing of the relationship between PKR and poxvirus antagonists revealed how an evolutionary conflict with ancient pathogenic poxviruses has shaped a specific bat host-virus interface. More importantly, we determined that duplicated PKRs of the Myotis species have undergone functional diversification allowing them to collectively escape from and enhance control of DNA and RNA viruses. These findings suggest that viral-driven adaptations in PKR contribute to modern virus-bat interactions and may account for bat specific immunity.",

    "abstract": "The genus Chlorocebus is widely distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa, and in the last 300 thousand years expanded from equatorial Africa into the southernmost latitudes of the continent. In these new environments, colder climate was a likely driver of natural selection. We investigated population-level genetic variation in the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) gene region - implicated in non-shivering thermogenesis within brown/beige adipocytes - in 73 wild savanna monkeys from three taxa representing this southern expansion (C. pygerythrus hilgerti, C. cynosuros, C. p. pygerythrus) ranging from Kenya to South Africa. We found 17 SNPs with extended haplotype homozygosity consistent with positive selective sweeps, 10 of which show no significant LD with each other. Phylogenetic generalized least squares modeling with ecological covariates suggest that most derived allele frequencies are significantly associated with solar irradiance and winter precipitation, rather than overall low temperatures. This selection and association with irradiance appears to be driven by a population isolate in the southern coastal belt of South Africa. We suggest that sunbathing behaviors common to savanna monkeys, in combination with strength of solar irradiance, may mediate adaptations to thermal stress via non-shivering thermogenesis among savanna monkeys. The variants we discovered all lie in non-coding regions, some with previously documented regulatory functions, calling for further validation and research.",

    "abstract": "Non-linear Mendelian randomization is an extension to standard Mendelian randomization to explore the shape of the causal relationship between an exposure and outcome using an instrumental variable. The approach divides the population into strata and calculates separate instrumental variable estimates in each stratum. However, the standard implementation of stratification in non-linear Mendelian randomization, referred to as the residual method, relies on strong parametric assumptions of linearity and homogeneity between the instrument and the exposure to form the strata. If these stratification assumptions are violated, the instrumental variable assumptions may be violated in the strata even if they are satisfied in the population, resulting in misleading estimates. We propose a new stratification method, referred to as the doubly-ranked method, that does not require strict parametric assumptions to create strata with different average levels of the exposure such that the instrumental variable assumptions are satisfied within the strata. Our simulation study indicates that the doubly-ranked method can obtain unbiased stratum-specific estimates and appropriate coverage rates even when the effect of the instrument on the exposure is non-linear or heterogeneous. Moreover, it can also provide unbiased estimates when the exposure is coarsened (that is, rounded, binned into categories, or truncated), a scenario that is common in applied practice and leads to substantial bias in the residual method. We applied the proposed doubly-ranked method to investigate the effect of alcohol intake on systolic blood pressure, and found evidence of a positive effect of alcohol intake, particularly at higher levels of alcohol consumption.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing has rich potential for genomic epidemiology and public health investigations of bacterial pathogens, particularly in low-resource settings and at the point of care, due to its portability and affordability. However, low base-call accuracy has limited the reliability of ONT data for critical tasks such as antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and virulence gene detection and typing, serotype prediction and cluster identification. Thus, Illumina sequencing remains the standard for genomic surveillance despite higher capital and running costs.\n\nMethodsWe tested the accuracy of ONT-only assemblies for common applied bacterial genomics tasks (genotyping and cluster detection, implemented via Kleborate, Kaptive and Pathogenwatch), using data from 54 unique Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. ONT reads generated via MinION with R9.4 flowcells were basecalled using three alternative models (Fast, High-accuracy (HAC) and Super-accuracy (SUP), available within ONTs Guppy software), assembled with Flye and polished using Medaka. Accuracy of typing using ONT-only assemblies was compared with that of Illumina-only and hybrid ONT+Illumina assemblies, constructed from the same isolates as reference standards.\n\nResultsThe most resource-intensive ONT-assembly approach (SUP basecalling, with or without Medaka polishing) performed best, yielding reliable capsule (K) type calls for all strains (100% exact or best matching locus), reliable multi-locus sequence type (MLST) assignment (98.3% exact match or single-locus variants), and good detection of acquired AMR genes and mutations (88% - 100% correct identification across the various drug classes). Distance-based trees generated from SUP+Medaka assemblies accurately reflected overall genetic relationships between isolates; however, the definition of outbreak clusters from ONT-only assemblies was problematic. HAC basecalling + Medaka polishing performed similarly to SUP basecalling without polishing, and polishing introduced errors into HAC- or Fast-basecalled assemblies. Therefore, we recommend investing compute resources into basecalling (SUP model) over polishing, where compute resources and/or time are limiting.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our results show that MLST, K type and AMR determinants can be reliably identified with ONT-only data. However, cluster detection remains challenging with this technology.",

    "abstract": "The orexigenic peptide ghrelin exerts important functions in energy metabolism and cellular homeostasis by activating the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a (GHSR1a), and thus has therapeutic potential to treat certain diseases. Native ghrelin carries an essential O-fatty acyl moiety at the side-chain of its third Ser residue; however, this posttranslational modification is susceptible to hydrolysis by certain esterases in circulation, representing a major route of in vivo inactivation of ghrelin. In the present study, we developed a novel approach to prepare various esterase-resistant ghrelin analogs via photo-induced thiol-ene click chemistry. A recombinant unacylated human ghrelin mutant carrying a unique Cys residue at the third position was reacted with commercially available end alkenes, thus various alkyl moieties were introduced to the side-chain of its unique Cys residue via a thioether bond. Among eleven S-alkylated ghrelin analogs, analog 11, generated by reacting with 2-methyl-1-octene, not only acquired much higher stability in human serum and fetal bovine serum, but also acquired moderately higher activity compared with native human ghrelin. Thus, the present study not only provided an efficient approach to prepare various esterase-resistant ghrelin analogs, but also produced a novel highly stable and highly active ghrelin analog with therapeutic potential.",

    "abstract": "During DNA replication, DNA lesions present in lagging strand templates are initially encountered by DNA polymerase {delta} (pol {delta}). The historical view for what transpires from these encounters is that replication of the afflicted lagging strand template abruptly stops, activating DNA damage tolerance (DDT) pathways that replicate the offending lesion and adjacent DNA sequence, allowing pol {delta} to resume downstream. However, qualitative studies observed that human pol {delta} is capable of replicating various DNA lesions, albeit to unknown extents, which raises issues regarding the roles of pol {delta} and DDT in the replication of DNA lesions. To address these issues, we re-constituted human lagging strand replication to quantitatively characterize initial encounters of pol {delta} holoenzymes with DNA lesions. The results indicate that pol {delta} holoenzymes support stable dNTP incorporation opposite and beyond multiple lesions and the extent of these activities depends on the lesion and pol {delta} proofreading. Furthermore, after encountering a given DNA lesion, subsequent dissociation of pol {delta} is distributed around the lesion and a portion of pol {delta} does not dissociate at all. The distributions of these events are dependent on the lesion and pol {delta} proofreading. These results challenge our understanding of DNA lesion replication and DDT.",

    "abstract": "Acylation of diverse carbohydrates occurs across all domains of life and can be catalysed by proteins with a membrane bound acyltransferase-3 (AT3) domain (PF01757). In bacteria, these proteins are essential in processes including symbiosis, resistance to viruses and antimicrobials, and biosynthesis of antibiotics, yet their structure and mechanism is largely unknown. In this study, evolutionary co-variance analysis was used to build a computational model of the structure of a bacterial O-antigen modifying acetyltransferase, OafB. The resulting structure exhibited a novel fold for the AT3 domain, which molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated is stable in the membrane. The AT3 domain contains 10 transmembrane helices arranged to form a large cytoplasmic cavity lined by residues known to be essential for function. Further molecular dynamics simulations support a model where the acyl-coA donor spans the membrane through accessing a pore created by movement of an important loop capping the inner cavity, enabling OafB to present the acetyl group close to the likely catalytic resides on the extracytoplasmic surface. Limited but important interactions with the fused SGNH domain in OafB are identified and modelling suggests this domain is mobile and can both accept acyl-groups from the AT3 and then reach beyond the membrane to reach acceptor substrates. Together this new general model of AT3 function provides a framework for the development of inhibitors that could abrogate critical functions of bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a disease that claims ~1.5 million lives annually. The current treatment regime is long and expensive, and missed doses contribute to drug resistance. There is much to be understood about the Mtb cell envelope, a complicated barrier that antibiotics need to negotiate to enter the cell. Within this envelope, the plasma membrane is the ultimate obstacle and is proposed to be comprised of over 50% mannosylated phosphatidylinositol lipids (phosphatidyl-myoinositol mannosides, PIMs), whose role in the membrane structure remains elusive. Here we used multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to understand the structure-function relationship of the PIM lipid family and decipher how they self-organize to drive biophysical properties of the Mycobacterial plasma membrane. To validate the model, we tested known anti-tubercular drugs and replicated previous experimental results. Our results shed new light into the organization of the Mycobacterial plasma membrane and provides a working model of this complex membrane to use for in silico studies. This opens the door for new methods to probe potential antibiotic targets and further understand membrane protein function.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=169 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/498153v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (56K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@102b357org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c30f8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@22f32aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8a6f65_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Dendritic protein synthesis is a well-known regulator of neurotransmission in the central nervous system. For example, local on-demand protein synthesis in dendrites is required for hippocampal long-term1,2 and homeostatic plasticity3. Although axonal protein synthesis is a key regulator in neural circuit assembly during early development4-6, it is unclear if local translation in mature axons plays a functional role in neurotransmission of the mammalian central nervous system. Here we show that local translation in axons regulates pyramidal cell neurotransmission in primary visual cortex microcircuits in a synapse-type-specific manner7,8. Using paired recordings to manipulate pre- and postsynaptic neurons independently, we found that presynaptic translation sustains neurotransmission and regulates short-term plasticity. This was mediated via mTOR and cap-dependent translation, with presynaptic NMDA receptors acting as an up-stream trigger. By isolating the axon from the soma with laser microsurgery, we unveiled that axonal translation was required to sustain neurotransmission. With live endogenous RNA imaging, we found that RNA granules stably docked in individual presynaptic compartments, suggesting bouton-specific regulation. In agreement, presynaptic translation influenced pyramidal cell synapses to neighbouring pyramidal cells, but not to inhibitory Martinotti cells. Our study establishes local protein synthesis in mature axons as a fundamental regulatory principle that governs information transfer at central synapses.",

    "abstract": "Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is an emerging opportunistic respiratory pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). S. maltophilia is frequently observed in polymicrobial infections, and we have previously shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa promotes colonization and persistence of S. maltophilia in mouse respiratory infections. In this study, we used host and bacterial RNA sequencing to further define this interaction. To evaluate S. maltophilia transcript profiles we used a recently described method for selective capture of bacterial mRNA transcripts with strain specific RNA probes. We found that factors associated with the type IV pilus, including the histidine kinase subunit of a chemotactic two-component signaling system (chpA), had increased transcript levels during polymicrobial infection. Using immortalized CF respiratory epithelial cells, we found that infection with P. aeruginosa increases adherence of S. maltophilia, at least in part due to disruption of epithelial tight junctions. In contrast, an isogenic S. maltophilia chpA mutant lacked cooperative adherence to CF epithelia and decreased bacterial burden in vivo in polymicrobial infections with P. aeruginosa. Similarly, P. aeruginosa lacking elastase (lasB) did not promote S. maltophilia adherence or bacterial colonization and persistence in vivo. Based on these results, we conclude that disruption of lung tissue integrity by P. aeruginosa promotes adherence of S. maltophilia to the lung epithelia in a type IV pilus-dependent manner. These data provide insight into S. maltophilia colonization and persistence in patients in later stages of CF disease and may have implications for interactions with other bacterial opportunists.\n\nIMPORTANCEDespite advances in treatment options for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), complications of bacterial infections remain the greatest driver of morbidity and mortality in this patient population. These infections often involve more than one bacterial pathogen, and our understanding of how inter-species interactions impact disease progression is lacking. Previous work in our lab found that two CF pathogens, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa can cooperatively infect the lung to cause more severe infection. In the present study, we found that infection with P. aeruginosa promotes persistence of S. maltophilia by interfering with epithelial barrier integrity. Depolarization of the epithelial cell layer by P. aeruginosa secreted elastase increased S. maltophilia adherence, likely in a type IV pilus-dependent manner. Ultimately, this work sheds light on the molecular mechanisms governing an important polymicrobial interaction seen in pulmonary diseases such as CF.",

    "abstract": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is known to function as a global regulator of M. tuberculosis gene expression. Sequence-based transcriptomic profiling identified the mycobacterial regulon controlled by the cAMP receptor protein, CRP. In this study, we identified a new subset of CRP-associated genes including virulence determinants which are also under the control of a major regulator, PhoP. Our results suggest that PhoP as a DNA binding transcription factor, impacts expression of these genes, and phosphorylated PhoP promotes CRP recruitment at the target promoters. Further, we uncover a distinct regulatory mechanism involving CRP and PhoP on transcriptional control of these genes. While both these regulators influence gene expression, we show that activation of these genes requires direct recruitment of both PhoP and CRP at their target promoters. The most fundamental biological insight is derived from the inhibition of CRP binding at the regulatory regions in a PhoP-deleted strain owing to CRP-PhoP protein-protein interactions. Based on these results, a model is proposed suggesting how CRP and PhoP function as co-activators and contribute to activation of the essential pathogenic determinants. Together, these results uncover a novel mechanism where two interacting virulence factors impact expression of virulence determinants, have significant implications on TB pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the basis of hybrid vigor remains a key question in crop breeding and improvement, especially for rootstock development where F1 hybrids are extensively utilized. Full-sibling UCB-1 F1 seedling rootstocks are widely planted in commercial pistachio orchards that are generated by crossing two highly heterozygous outbreeding parental trees of Pistacia atlantica (female) and P. integerrima (male). This results in extensive phenotypic variability, prompting costly removal of low-yielding small trees. To identify the genetic basis of this variability, we assembled chromosome-scale genome assemblies of the parental trees of UCB-1. We genotyped 960 UCB-1 trees in an experimental orchard for which we also collected multi-year phenotypes. We genotyped an additional 1,358 rootstocks in six commercial pistachio orchards and collected single-year tree size data. Genome-wide single marker association tests identified loci associated with tree size and shape, sex, and precocity. In the experimental orchard, we identified multiple trait-associated loci and a strong candidate for ZZ/ZW sex chromosomes. We found significant marker associations unique to different traits and to early vs. late phenotypic measures of the same trait. We detected two loci strongly associated with rootstock size in commercial orchards. Pseudo-testcross classification of markers demonstrated that the trait-associated alleles for each locus were segregating in the gametes of opposite parents. These two loci interact epistatically to generate the bimodal distribution of tree size with undesirable small trees observed by growers. We identified candidate genes within these regions. These findings provide a foundational resource for marker development and genetic selection of vigorous pistachio UCB-1 rootstock.",

Here, through a large-scale metagenomic analysis of archeological samples, we discovered bacterial species related to modern-day Clostridium tetani, which produces the tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) and causes the disease tetanus. We assembled draft genomes from 38 distinct human archeological samples spanning five continents and dating to as early as ~4000 BCE. These genomes had varying levels of completeness and a subset of them displayed hallmarks of ancient DNA damage. While 24 fall into known C. tetani clades, phylogenetic analysis revealed novel C. tetani lineages, as well as two novel Clostridium species (\"Clostridium sp. X and Y\") closely related to C. tetani. Within these genomes, we found 13 TeNT variants with unique substitution profiles, including a subgroup of TeNT variants found exclusively in ancient samples from South America. We experimentally tested a TeNT variant selected from a ~6000-year-old Chilean mummy sample and found that it induced tetanus muscle paralysis in mice with potency comparable to modern TeNT. Our work identifies neurotoxigenic C. tetani in ancient DNA, new Clostridium species unique to ancient human samples, and a novel variant of TeNT that can cause disease in mammals.",

    "abstract": "Schwann cells (SCs) myelinate and provide trophic support to axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and disruption of SC cellular metabolism leads to demyelination and axon degeneration, both symptoms of peripheral neuropathies. The lactate shuttle hypothesis proposes that glycolytic support cells supply lactate to adjacent axons to sustain their high metabolic demands, a process that requires the interconversion of lactate and pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in both SCs and neurons. To test this hypothesis in the PNS, we selectively knocked out the genes for both LDH enzymes, LDHA and LDHB, in motor neurons (MNs), sensory neurons (SNs), or SCs. Interestingly, motor axons and their synapses progressively degenerate when LDH is deleted from either MNs or SCs; however, defects in sensory axons or their terminals were not observed when LDH was excised from either SNs or SCs. Deletion of LDH in SCs also leads to a decrease in total ATP levels in peripheral nerves despite a marked accumulation of pyruvate and glycolytic intermediates, consistent with the failure of pyruvate to lactate conversion in SCs leading to energetic deficits in axons. These results support a model in which motor axons are more dependent on SC-derived lactate than are sensory axons, a specific dependency that suggests LDH and lactate shuttling influence the course of motor-dominated neuropathies such as ALS.",

Despite the fact that antimicrobial sensitivity of B. burgdorferi has been widely studied, there is still a need to develop an affordable, practical, high-throughput in vivo model which can be used to find effective antibiotic therapies, especially for the recently discovered persister and biofilm forms. Recent studies showed that Zebrafish (Danio rerio) could offer a novel, high-throughput, affordable model in antibiotic therapies for various infections agents can be studied. Therefore, in this study, we developed a straightforward, standardized infection procedure and tested it for zebrafish survival rate, morphological or behavioral changes post-infection as well as providing evidence that B. burgdorferi persists in zebrafish using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemical (IHC) techniques. Morphological and physiological examination showed a significant size difference between control and infected zebrafish at 2 wpi, and infected zebrafish exhibited slower heart rates through 72 hpi. Furthermore, our results showed B. burgdorferi DNA can be detected and active replication of the B. burgdorferi 16S rRNA gene can be confirmed through 10 days post-infection via PCR and Reverse Transcription PCR respectively. Fluorescent microscopy and immunohistochemical staining revealed spirochetes present in the eyes, gills, heart, liver, tail, and hindbrain tissues though 72 hpi as well as the stomach and digestive tract at 2 weeks post-infection, respectively.

Here, we identified a class of small cytosolic DNAs (scDNAs) of [~]20-40 bp in human and mouse cell lines. scDNAs competed with herring testis DNA (HT-DNA, [~]200-1500 bp) for binding to cGAS, and repressing HT-DNA-induced cGAS activation and the associated interferon {beta} (IFN{beta}) production. Moreover, scDNAs promoted cGAS and Beclin-1 interaction, triggering the release of Rubicon, a negative regulator of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase class III (PI3KC3)5,6, from the Beclin-1-PI3KC3 complex, activating PI3KC3 and inducing autophagy. DNA damage decreased and autophagy inducers increased scDNA levels. scDNA transfection or autophagy induction attenuated DNA damage-induced cGAS-STING activation and IFN{beta} expression. Thus, scDNAs acted as molecular brakes of cGAS activation, preventing excessive inflammatory cytokine production following DNA damage. Our findings lay foundations for understanding the physiological and pathological functions of scDNAs.",

    "abstract": "Src-homology 2 (SH2) domains are protein interaction domains that bind to specific peptide motifs containing phosphotyrosine. SHP2, a tyrosine phosphatase encoded by PTPN11 gene, which has been emerged as positive or negative modulator in multiple signaling pathways, contains two SH2 domains, respectively called N-SH2 and C-SH2. These domains play a relevant role in regulating SHP2 activity, either by recognizing its binding partners or by blocking its catalytic site. Considering the multiple functions that these domains carry out in SHP2, N-SH2 and C-SH2 represent an interesting case of study. Here, we present a methodology that permits, by means of the principal component analysis (PCA), to study and to rationalize the structures adopted by the SH2 domains, in terms of the conformations of their binding sites. The structures can be distinguished, grouped, classified and reported in a diagram. This approach permits to identify the accessible conformations of the SH2 domains in different binding conditions and to eventually reveal allosteric interactions. The method further reveals that the conformation dynamics of N-SH2 and C- SH2 strongly differ, which likely reflects their distinct functional roles.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, a progressive neurological disorder characterized by short and long-term memory loss, including cognitive and functional impairment, which is refractory to current therapy. It is suggested that the aggregation of {beta}-amyloid (A{beta}) peptide on neuronal cell surface leads to various deviations of its vital function due to myriad pathways defined by internalization of calcium ions, apoptosis promotion, reduction of membrane potential, synaptic activity loss etc. These are associated with structural reorganizations and pathologies of the cell cytoskeleton mainly involving actin filaments and microtubules, and consequently - alterations of cell mechanical properties. Thus, the effect of amyloid oligomers on cells Youngs modulus has been observed in a variety of studies. However, the precise connection between the formation of amyloid aggregates on cell membranes and their effects on local mechanical properties of living cells is still unresolved. In this work, we have used correlative scanning ion-conductance microscopy (SICM) to study cell topography, Youngs modulus mapping and confocal imaging of A{beta} aggregates formation on living cell surfaces with subsequent assessment of the reactive oxygen species levels inside single cells using platinum nanoelectrodes. We showed that correlative SICM technique, in conjunction with topography mapping and confocal imaging, can be used for Patch-Clamp recordings from living cells with evidently formed FAM-labeled A{beta} aggregates on its surface. As we demonstrated, SICM can be successfully applied to studying cytotoxicity mechanisms of A{beta} aggregates on living cell surface.",

    "abstract": "Neural progenitors transit through multiple competence states that restrict production of each neural cell type. In Drosophila neuroblasts, a timed genome reorganization relocates the cell fate gene, hunchback, to the nuclear periphery, terminating competence to produce early-born neurons. Distal antenna (Dan), a pipsqueak (Psq) superfamily protein, is transiently downregulated at mid-embryogenesis, which is required for this relocation. Here we find that Dan is a highly intrinsically disordered protein, and when its Psq DNA-binding domain is increasingly disrupted, Dan coalesces into steadily larger, interconnected hubs of rapid protein exchange. Consistent with these phase-separation properties, Dan has a predicted LARKS domain, a structural motif that forms reversible interactions associated with phase-separation. In the embryo, loss of either the Psq motif or the LARKS domain abrogates Dans ability to maintain neuroblast early competence upon misexpression, suggesting that Dan requires both DNA-binding and phase-separation to regulate neuroblast competence. Finally, we found that Dan strongly interacts with proteins of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), and Elys, a core NPC scaffold protein known to regulate genome architecture, binds the hb intron and is required for competence termination. Together, the results support a model for how Dans phase-separation properties can mediate dynamic restructuring by balancing genome-binding, self-association, and interaction among nuclear architecture regulators.",

    "abstract": "How cell specification can be controlled in a reproducible manner is a fundamental question in development biology. In ascidians, a group of marine invertebrate chordates, geometry plays a key role in achieving this control. Here, we use mathematical modeling to demonstrate that geometry dictates the neural-epidermal cell fate choice in the 32-cell stage ascidian embryo by a two-step process involving first the modulation of ERK signaling and second, the expression of the neural marker gene, Otx. The model describes signal transduction by the ERK pathway that is stimulated by FGF and repressed by ephrin, and ERK-mediated control of Otx gene expression, which involves both an activator and an inhibitor of transcription. Considering the measured area of cell surface contacts with FGF- or ephrin-expressing cells as inputs, the solutions of the model reproduce the experimental observations about ERK activation and Otx expression in the different cells under normal and perturbed conditions. Sensitivity analyses and computations of Hill coefficients allow to quantify the robustness of the specification mechanism controlled by cell surface area and to identify the respective role played by each signaling input. Simulations also predict in which conditions the dual control of gene expression by an activator and an inhibitor that are both under the control of ERK can induce a robust ON/OFF control of neural fate induction.\n\nAuthor summaryThe development of a single cell zygote into a multicellular embryo occurs thanks to the combination of cell division and cell specification. The latter process corresponds to the progressive acquisition by the embryonic cells of their final physiological and functional characteristics, which rely on well-defined signaling-controlled genetic programs. The origin of the great robustness of cell specification remains poorly understood. Here, we address this question in the framework of the embryonic neural fate induction in ascidians, which are marine invertebrates. At the 32-cells stage, four cells identified by their precise location in the embryo adopt neural fate. On the basis of experimental observations, we develop a mathematical model that predicts that the choice between the neural or epidermal fate is controlled by the cell surface areas of the cells in contact with two antagonistic signals, FGF and ephrin. Our findings provide a computational confirmation of the major role played by the geometry of the embryo in controlling cell lineage acquisition during ascidian development.",

    "abstract": "Here we describe a novel neuro-mesodermal assembloid model which recapitulates aspects of peripheral nervous system (PNS) development such as neural crest cell (NCC) induction, delamination, migration and sensory as well as sympathetic ganglion formation. The ganglia send neuronal projections to the mesodermal as well as the neural compartment. Axons in the mesodermal part are associated with Schwann cells. In addition, peripheral ganglia as well as nerve fibers interact with the co-developing vascular plexus, forming a neurovascular niche. Finally, developing sensory ganglia show response to capsaicin treatment indicating their functionality.\n\nThe presented assembloid model could help to uncover mechanisms of NCC delamination, migration and PNS development in the human tissue context. Moreover, the model could be used for toxicity screenings or drug testing. The co-development of mesodermal and neuroectodermal tissues and of a well-organized vascular plexus along with a peripheral nervous system allows to investigate the crosstalk between neuroectoderm and mesoderm and between peripheral neurons/neuroblasts and endothelial cells. Such interactions influence NCC delamination and migration, sensory neuron differentiation and rearrangement of the primitive vascular plexus in the embryo.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo investigate the effects of different indoor lighting intensity (500 lx, 750 lx and 1,000 lx) on normal ocular axial length growth by using juvenal rhesus monkeys.\n\nMethodsTwenty-four juvenile monkeys were exposed continuously to normal intensity light (NIL, 500 lx, n=16), medium intensity light (MIL, 750 lx, n=8) and high intensity light (HIL, 1 000 lx, n=8), with a same CCT value (about 3000 K) for 246 days. Axial length, anterior chamber depth, corneal curvature radius were measured at about a monthly interval.\n\nResultsAfter 246 days of light exposure, the growth of axial length of the MIL group (750 lx) were 0.151 {+/-} 0.081 mm and 0.139 {+/-} 0.070 mm in the right and left eyes, respectively, and significantly larger in comparison with the NIL group (500lx, OD: 0.068 {+/-} 0.055 mm, OS: 0.074 {+/-} 0.057 mm) and the HIL group (1000lx,OD:0.063 {+/-} 0.093 mm, OS: 0.084 {+/-} 0.052 mm) monkeys. This effect was stable and robust during the whole experimental period.\n\nConclusionThe effects of different intensity lighting on normal ocular axial development was not linear as most people currently think. We must be cautious when it comes to elevate light intensity in classrooms. Whether this conclusion is correct under lights of other CCT value needs further study.",

    "abstract": "Chitinase-like proteins (CLPs) are members of the family 18 glycosyl hydrolases, which include chitinases and the enzymatically inactive CLPs. A mutation in the enzymes catalytic site, conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates, allowed CLPs to evolve independently with functions that do not require chitinase activity. CLPs normally function during inflammatory responses, wound healing, and host defense, but when they persist at excessive levels at sites of chronic inflammation and in tissue-remodeling disorders, they correlate positively with disease progression and poor prognosis. However, little is known about their physiological function. Drosophila melanogaster has six CLPS, termed Imaginal disc growth factors (Idgfs), encoded by Idgf1, Idgf2, Idgf3, Idgf4, Idgf5, and Idgf6. In this study we developed tools to facilitate characterization of the physiological roles of the Idgfs by deleting each of the Idgf genes using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and assessing loss-of-function phenotypes. Using null lines, we showed that loss-of-function for all six Idgf proteins significantly lowers fertility and viability and compromises germ cell migration. We also showed that Idgfs play roles in epithelial morphogenesis, maintaining proper epithelial architecture and cell shape, regulating E-cadherin and cortical Actin, and protecting these tissues against CO2 exposure. Defining the normal molecular mechanisms of CLPS is key to understanding how deviations tip the balance from a physiological to a pathological state.",
