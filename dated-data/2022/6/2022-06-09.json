    "abstract": "Leucine-rich-repeat-kinase 1 (LRRK1) and its homologue LRRK2 are multidomain kinases possessing a ROC-CORA-CORB containing GTPase domain and phosphorylate distinct Rab proteins. LRRK1 loss of function mutations cause the bone disorder osteosclerotic metaphyseal dysplasia, whereas LRRK2 missense mutations that enhance kinase activity cause Parkinsons disease. Previous work suggested that LRRK1 but not LRRK2, is activated via a Protein Kinase C (PKC)-dependent mechanism. Here we demonstrate that phosphorylation and activation of LRRK1 in HEK293 cells is blocked by PKC inhibitors including LXS-196 (Darovasertib), a compound that has entered clinical trials. We show multiple PKC isoforms phosphorylate and activate recombinant LRRK1 in a manner reversed by phosphatase treatment. PKC unexpectedly does not activate LRRK1 by phosphorylating the kinase domain, but instead phosphorylates a cluster of conserved residues (Ser1064, Ser1074 and Thr1075) located within a region of the CORB domain of the GTPase domain. These residues are positioned at the equivalent region of the LRRK2 DK helix reported to stabilize the kinase domain C-helix in the active conformation. Thr1075 represents an optimal PKC site phosphorylation motif and its mutation to Ala, blocked PKC-mediated activation of LRRK1. A triple Glu mutation of Ser1064/Ser1074/Thr1075 to mimic phosphorylation, enhanced LRRK1 kinase activity ~3-fold. From analysis of available structures, we postulate that phosphorylation of Ser1064, Ser1074 and Thr1075 activates LRRK1 by promoting interaction and stabilization of the aC-helix on the kinase domain. This study provides new fundamental insights into the mechanism controlling LRRK1 activity and reveals a novel unexpected activation mechanism.",

In order to get further insight into the structure and function of Bax when it is inserted in the OMM, we attempted to reconstitute Bax in nanodiscs. Cell-free protein synthesis in the presence of nanodiscs did not allow to obtain Bax-containing nanodiscs, but it provided a simple way to purify full-length Bax without any tag. Purified wild-type Bax (BaxWT) and a constitutively active mutant (BaxP168A) displayed biochemical properties that were in line with previous characterizations following their expression in yeast and human cells followed by their reconstitution into liposomes. Both Bax variants were then reconstituted in nanodiscs. Size exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy showed that nanodiscs formed with BaxP168A were larger than nanodiscs formed with BaxWT. This was consistent with the hypothesis that BaxP168A was reconstituted in nanodiscs as an active oligomer.",

The mechanism of phospholipid modulation of any pLGIC is not well understood. We demonstrate that the model pLGIC, ELIC (Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel), is positively modulated by the anionic phospholipid, phosphatidylglycerol, from the outer leaflet of the membrane. To elucidate the mechanism of phosphatidylglycerol modulation, we determine a structure of ELIC in an open conformation. The structure shows a bound phospholipid in an outer leaflet site, and conformational changes in the phospholipid binding site unique to the open state. In combination with streamlined alchemical free energy perturbation calculations and functional measurements in asymmetric liposomes, the data support a mechanism by which an anionic phospholipid stabilizes the open state of a pLGIC by specific, state-dependent binding to this site.",

    "abstract": "During host infection, single-celled apicomplexan parasites like Plasmodium and Toxoplasma use a motility mechanism called gliding, which differs fundamentally from other known mechanisms of eukaryotic cell motility. Gliding is thought to be powered by a thin layer of flowing filamentous (F)-actin1- 3 sandwiched between the plasma membrane and a myosin-coated4,5 inner membrane complex. How this surface actin layer drives the diverse apicomplexan gliding modes observed experimentally - helical, circular, and twirling6,7, and patch8, pendulum9, or rolling2 - presents a rich biophysical puzzle. Here, we use single-molecule imaging to track individual actin filaments and myosin complexes in live Toxoplasma gondii. Based on these data, we hypothesize that F-actin flows arise by self-organization, rather than following a microtubule-based template as previously believed. We develop a continuum model of emergent F-actin flow within the unusual confines provided by parasite geometry. In the presence of F-actin turnover, our model predicts the emergence of a steady-state mode in which actin transport is largely rearward. Removing actin turnover leads to actin patches that recirculate up and down the cell, a \"cyclosis\" that we observe experimentally for drug-stabilized actin bundles in live parasites. These findings provide a mechanism by which actin turnover governs a transition between distinct self-organized F-actin states, whose properties can account for the diverse gliding modes known to occur. More broadly, we illustrate how different forms of gliding motility can emerge as an intrinsic consequence of the self-organizing properties of F-actin flow in a confined geometry.",

    "abstract": "Modern microscopy relies increasingly on microscope automation to improve throughput, ensure reproducibility or observe rare events. Automation requires in particular computer control of the important elements of the microscope. Furthermore, optical elements that are usually fixed or manually movable can be placed on electronically-controllable elements. In most cases, a central electronics board is necessary to generate the control signals they require and to communicate with the computer. Fur such tasks, Arduino microcontrollers are widely used due to their low cost and programming entry barrier. However, they are limiting in their performance for applications that require high-speed or multiple parallel processes. Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) are the perfect technology for high-speed microscope control, as they are capable of processing signals in parallel and with high temporal precision. While plummeting price made the technology available to consumers, a major hurdle remains the complex languages used to configure them. In this work, we used an affordable FPGA, delivered with an open-source and friendly-to-use programming language, to create a versatile microscope control platform called MicroFPGA. It is capable of synchronously triggering cameras and multiple lasers following complex patterns, as well as generating various signals used to control microscope elements such as filter wheels, servomotor stages, flip-mirrors, laser power or acoustooptic modulators. MicroFPGA is open-source and we provide online Micro-Manager, Java, Python and LabVIEW libraries, together with blueprints and tutorials.",

    "abstract": "Calmodulin (CaM) is a calcium sensor which binds and regulates a wide range of target-proteins. This implicitly enables the concentration of calcium to influence many downstream physiological responses, including muscle contraction, learning and depression. The antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine (TFP) is a known CaM inhibitor. By binding to various sites, TFP prevents CaM from associating to target-proteins. However, the molecular and state-dependent mechanisms behind CaM inhibition by drugs such as TFP are largely unknown. Here, we build a Markov state model (MSM) from adaptively sampled molecular dynamics simulations and reveal the structural and dynamical features behind the inhibitory mechanism of TFP-binding to the C-terminal domain of CaM. We specifically identify three major TFP binding-modes from the MSM macrostates, and distinguish their effect on CaM conformation by using a systematic analysis protocol based on biophysical descriptors and tools from machine learning. The results show that depending on the binding orientation, TFP effectively stabilizes features of the calcium-unbound CaM, either affecting the CaM hydrophobic binding pocket, the calcium binding sites or the secondary structure content in the bound domain. The conclusions drawn from this work may in the future serve to formulate a complete model of pharmacological modulation of CaM, which furthers our understanding of how these drugs affect signaling pathways as well as associated diseases.\n\nAuthor summaryCalmodulin (CaM) is a calcium-sensing protein which makes other proteins dependent on the surrounding calcium concentration by binding to these proteins. Such protein-protein interactions with CaM are vital for calcium to control many physiological pathways within the cell. The antipsychotic drug trifluoperazine (TFP) inhibits CaMs ability to bind and regulate other proteins. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations together with Markov state modeling and machine learning to understand the structural and dynamical features by which TFP bound to the one domain of CaM prevents association to other proteins. We find that TFP encourages CaM to adopt a conformation that is like the one stabilized in absence of calcium: depending on the binding orientation of TFP, the drug indeed either affects the CaM hydrophobic binding pocket, the calcium binding sites or the secondary structure content in the domain. Understanding TFP binding is a first step towards designing better drugs targeting CaM.",

    "abstract": "Although integrins are known to be mechano-sensitive and to possess many subtypes that have distinct physiological roles, single molecule studies of force exertion have thus far been limited to RGD-binding integrins. Here, we show that integrin 4{beta}1 and RGD-binding integrins (V{beta}1 and 5{beta}1) require markedly different tension thresholds to support cell spreading. Furthermore, actin assembled downstream of 4{beta}1 forms cross-linked networks in circularly spread cells, is in rapid retrograde flow, and exerts low forces from actin polymerization. In contrast, actin assembled downstream of V{beta}1 forms stress fibers linking focal adhesions in elongated cells, is in slow retrograde flow, and matures to exert high forces (>54-pN) via myosin II. Conformational activation of both integrins occurs below 12-pN, suggesting that post-activation subtype-specific cytoskeletal remodeling imposes the higher threshold for spreading on RGD substrates. Multiple layers of single integrin mechanics for activation, mechanotransduction and cytoskeleton remodeling revealed here may underlie subtype-dependence of diverse processes such as somite formation and durotaxis.",

    "abstract": "Defects in double-strand repair mechanisms - both through germline or somatic inactivation of repair genes - is a hallmark of basal-like breast cancers. In this genetically-unstable context, a recurrent shift in cell identity occurs within the mammary epithelium. Basal-like tumors have indeed been proposed to originate from luminal progenitor (LP) cells yet tumor-initiating events remain poorly understood. Here, we map state transitions at the onset of basal-like tumorigenesis, using a Brca-1 deficient mouse model launching tumorigenesis in multiple LP cells. Combining single-cell transcriptomics to spatial multiplex imaging, we identify a population of cycling p16-expressing cells, emerging from the luminal progenitor compartment, undergoing partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and losing luminal identity. Pseudo-temporal analyses position these cells as a transitory pre-tumoral state between aberrant Brca1-deficient luminal progenitors and growing tumor cells. In patients, the p16 pre-tumoral signature is found in early stage basal-like tumors, that rarely recur. Concomitant to p16 activation, we show that LP cells undergo an epigenomic crisis attested by the general re-organization of their heterochromatin. They accumulate multiple H3K27me3 micro-foci - reminiscent of the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatin foci (SAHFs) - and lose their inactive X (Xi). Both p16 activation and heterochromatin reorganization are hallmarks of human basal-like breast tumors; we propose that these events occur during initial LP transformation and are scars of an initial transitory senescent-like state.",

    "abstract": "Iron deficiency during the fetal-neonatal period results in long-term neurodevelopmental impairments associated with pervasive and widespread hippocampal gene dysregulation. Globally, fetal-neonatal iron deficiency produces both long-term activation and repression of hundreds of loci in the adult rat hippocampus. Prenatal choline (a methyl donor) supplementation can partially reverse these effects, suggesting an interaction between iron and choline in regulating the hippocampal transcriptome. To gain insights into the underlying epigenetic signatures, we integrate hippocampal transcriptomes and epigenetic marks of active (transposase accessible chromatin/ATAC) and repressed (H3K9me3 enrichment) genes in adult rats that had been exposed to fetal-neonatal iron deficiency with or without prenatal choline supplementation. Rats were made iron-deficient during fetal and neonatal period by limiting maternal iron intake from gestational day (G) 2 through postnatal day (P) 7. Choline (5.5 g/kg) was given to half of the pregnant dams during G11-18. This paradigm produced four comparison groups (Iron-sufficient [IS], Iron-deficient [ID], IS+choline [ISch], and ID+choline [IDch]). Hippocampi were collected from P65 males and analyzed for changes in chromatin conformation and histone H3K9me3 enrichment. ATAC-seq results accounted for 22% and 24%, whereas H3K9me3 enrichment accounted for 1.7% and 13% of differences in ID- and IDch-altered gene expression. These epigenetic changes were annotated onto gene networks regulating synaptic structure and plasticity, neuroinflammation, and reward circuits. The low correlation between gene dysregulation and changes in ATAC or H3K9me3 signatures indicate involvements of other epigenetic modifications. This study provides a genome-wide findings of stable epigenetic changes and lays a foundation for further analyses to elucidate more fully iron-dependent epigenetic mechanisms that underlie iron deficiency, choline supplementation, and their interactions in mediating long-term neural gene dysregulation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTEarly-life iron deficiency can lead to long-term neurocognitive dysfunction and persistent neural gene dysregulation, despite prompt iron replenishment, suggesting that iron deficiency results in long-term neuroepigenomic changes. This study combined RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and ChIP-seq to provide the epigenetic basis for gene dysregulation due to fetal-neonatal iron deficiency and prenatal choline supplementation. We found that early-life iron deficiency alters epigenetic regulation of genes involved in neuronal development, cell signaling, neuroinflammation, and reward-related cognition. While choline supplementation to iron-deficient animals partially reverses these effects, it also leads to dysregulation of genes in iron-sufficient animals. The patterns of gene dysregulation were positively correlated with differences in chromatin accessibility and negatively correlated with repressive histone H3K9me3 modification. Our results indicate that these changes at the epigenetic level partially account for the long-term hippocampal gene dysregulation.",

Our data shows that MSBP keeps a majority of particles away from air-water interface and mitigates preferred orientation as verified by the analyses of apoferritin, hemagglutinin (HA) trimer and various sample proteins. The use of MSBP is a simple method to improve particle distribution for high-resolution structure determination in single-particle cryo-EM.",

    "abstract": "Claudins are cell-cell adhesion proteins within tight junctions that connect epithelial cells together. Claudins polymerize into a network of strand-like structures within the membrane of adjoining cells and create ion channels that control paracellular permeability to water and small molecules. Tight junction morphology and barrier function is tissue specific and regulated by claudin subtypes. Here, we present a molecular dynamics study of claudin-15 strands within lipid membranes and the role of a single-point mutation (A134P) on the third transmembrane helix (TM3) of claudin-15 in determining the morphology of the strand. Our results indicate that the A134P mutation significantly affects the lateral flexibility of the strands, increasing the persistence length of claudin-15 strands by a factor of three. Analyses of claudin-claudin contact in our {micro}second-long trajectories show that the mutation does not alter the intermolecular contacts (interfaces) between claudins. However, the dynamics and frequency of interfacial contacts are significantly affected. The A134P mutation introduces a kink in TM3 of claudin-15 similar to the one observed in claudin-3 crystal structure. The kink on TM3 skews the rotational flexibility of the claudins in the strands and limits their fluctuation in one direction. This asymmetric movement in the context of the double rows reduces the lateral flexibility of the strand and leads to higher persistence lengths of the mutant.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic details behind the activation of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) by apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and its mimetic peptides are still enigmatic. Resolving the fundamental principles behind the LCAT activation will facilitate the design of advanced HDL-mimetic therapeutic nanodiscs for LCAT deficiencies and coronary heart disease, and for several targeted drug delivery applications. Here, we have combined coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with complementary experiments to gain mechanistic insight into how apoA-I mimetic peptide 22A and its variants attune LCAT activity in peptide-lipid nanodiscs. Results highlight that peptide 22A forms transient antiparallel dimers in the rim of nanodiscs. The dimerization tendency considerably decreases with the removal of C-terminal lysine K22, which has also been shown to reduce the cholesterol esterification activity of LCAT. In addition, our simulations revealed that LCAT prefers to localize to the rim of nanodiscs in a manner that shields the membrane-binding domain (MBD), A-A, and the lid amino acids from the water phase, following the previous experimental evidence. Meanwhile, the location and conformation of LCAT in the rim of nanodisc are spatially more restricted when the active site covering lid of LCAT is in the open form. The average location and spatial dimensions of LCAT in its open form were highly compatible with the electron microscopy images. All peptide 22A variants studied here had a specific interaction site in the open LCAT structure flanked by the lid and MBD domain. The bound peptides showed different tendencies to form antiparallel dimers and, interestingly, the temporal binding site occupancies of the peptide variants affected their in vitro ability to promote LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix are essential for regulating cancer cell behaviour, but how they change depending on tumour type remains unclear. The aim of the current study was to determine how the mechanical properties of tumours that frequently metastasize to bones were affected depending on histological type. Human breast, kidney, and thyroid specimens containing tumour and normal tissue were collected during surgery. The elastic modulus and elastic fraction of each sample were characterised using atomic force microscopy and compared with histopathological markers. We observed that tumour mechanical properties were differentially affected depending on organ and histological type. Indeed, clear cell renal carcinoma and poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma displayed a decrease in the elastic modulus compared to their normal counterpart, while breast tumours, papillary renal carcinoma and fibrotic thyroid tumours displayed an increase in the elastic modulus. Elastic fraction decreased only for thyroid tumour tissue, indicating an increase in the viscosity. These findings suggest a unique mechanical profile associated with each subtype of cancer. Therefore, viscosity could be a discriminator between tumour and normal thyroid tissue, while elasticity could be a discriminator between the subtypes of breast, kidney and thyroid cancers.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=64 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/495321v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1372cddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1628197org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a0103org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a89b3a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "In this work, we provide a general method for inferring the stochastic behavior of compositional systems. Our approach is guided by the principle of maximum entropy, a data-driven modeling technique. In particular, we show that our method can accurately capture stochastic, inter-species relationships with minimal model parameters. We provide two proofs of principle. First, we measure the relative abundances of different bacteria and infer how they interact. Second, we show that our method outperforms a common alternative for the extraction of gene-gene interactions in triple-negative breast cancer.\n\nAuthor summaryCompositional systems, represented as proportions of some whole, are ubiquitous. They encompass the abundances of proteins in a cell, the distribution of organisms in nature, and the stoichiometry of the most basic chemical reactions. Thus, a central goal is to understand how such processes emerge from the behaviors of their components and their pairwise interactions. Such a study, however, is challenging for two key reasons. Firstly, such systems are complex and depend, often stochastically, on their constituent parts. Secondly, the data lie on a simplex which influences their correlations. We provide a general and data-driven modeling tool for compositional systems to resolve both of these issues. We achieve this through the principle of maximum entropy, which requires only minimal assumptions and limited experimental data in contrast to current alternatives. We show that our approach provides novel and biologically-intuitive insights and is promising as a comprehensive quantitative framework for compositional data.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in genes encoding components of chromatin modifying and remodeling complexes are among the most frequently observed somatic events in human cancers. For example, missense and nonsense mutations targeting the mixed lineage leukemia family member 3 (MLL3/KMT2C) histone methyltransferase occur in a range of solid tumors and heterozygous deletions encompassing MLL3 occur in a subset of aggressive leukemias. Although MLL3 loss can promote tumorigenesis in mice, the molecular targets and biological processes by which MLL3 suppresses tumorigenesis remain poorly characterized. Here we combined genetic, epigenomic, and animal modeling approaches to demonstrate that one of the mechanisms by which MLL3 links chromatin remodeling to tumor suppression is by co-activating the Cdkn2a tumor suppressor locus. Disruption of Mll3 cooperates with Myc overexpression in the development of murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), in which MLL3 binding to the Cdkn2a locus is blunted, resulting in reduced H3K4 methylation and low expression levels of the locus-encoded genes, Ink4a and Arf. Conversely, elevated MLL3 expression increases its binding to the CDKN2A locus and co-activates gene transcription. Endogenous Mll3 restoration reverses these chromatin and transcriptional effects and triggers Ink4a/Arf-dependent apoptosis. Underscoring the human relevance of this epistasis, we found that genomic alterations in MLL3 and CDKN2A display mutual exclusivity in human HCC samples. These results collectively point to a new mechanism for disrupting CDKN2A activity during cancer development and, in doing so, link MLL3 to an established tumor suppressor network.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the leading cause of breast cancer-related deaths and often driven by invasion and cancer-stem like cells (CSCs). Both the CSC phenotype and invasion have been associated with increased hyaluronic acid (HA) production. How these independent observations are connected, and which role metabolism plays in this process remains unclear due in part to the lack of convergent approaches that integrate engineered model systems, computational tools, and cancer biology. Using microfluidic invasion models, metabolomics, computational flux balance analysis (FBA), and bioinformatic analysis of patient data we investigated the functional links between the stem-like, invasive, and metabolic phenotype of breast cancer cells as a function of HA biosynthesis. Our results suggest that CSCs are more invasive than non-CSCs and that broad metabolic changes caused by overproduction of HA play a role in this process. Accordingly, overexpression of hyaluronic acid synthases (HAS) 2 or 3 induced a metabolic phenotype that promoted breast cancer cell stemness and invasion in vitro and upregulated a transcriptomic signature that was predictive of increased invasion and worse survival in patients. Collectively, this study suggests that HA overproduction leads to metabolic adaptations that help satisfy the energy demands necessary for 3D invasion of breast cancer stem cells further highlighting the importance of engineered model systems and multidisciplinary approaches in cancer research.",

    "abstract": "RNA splicing factors are recurrently affected by alteration-of-function mutations in clonal blood disorders, highlighting the importance of splicing regulation in hematopoiesis. However, our understanding of the impact of dysregulated RNA splicing has been hampered by the inability to distinguish mutant and wildtype cells in primary patient samples, the cell-type complexity of the hematopoietic system, and the sparse and biased coverage of splice junctions by short-read sequencing typically used in single-cell RNA sequencing. To overcome these limitations, we developed GoT-Splice by integrating Genotyping of Transcriptomes (GoT) with enhanced efficiency long-read single-cell transcriptome profiling, as well as proteogenomics (with CITE-seq). This allowed for the simultaneous single-cell profiling of gene expression, cell surface protein markers, somatic mutation status, and RNA splicing. We applied GoT-Splice to bone marrow progenitors from patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) affected by mutations in the most prevalent mutated RNA splicing factor - the core RNA splicing factor SF3B1. High-resolution mapping of SF3B1mut vs. SF3B1wt hematopoietic progenitors revealed a fitness advantage of SF3B1mut cells in the megakaryocytic-erythroid lineage, resulting in an expansion of SF3B1mut erythroid progenitor (EP) cells. SF3B1mut EP cells exhibited upregulation of genes involved in regulation of cell cycle and mRNA translation. Long-read single-cell transcriptomes revealed the previously reported increase of aberrant 3 splicing site usage in SF3B1mut cells. However, the ability to profile splicing within individual cell populations uncovered distinct cryptic 3 splice site usage across different progenitor populations, as well as stage-specific aberrant splicing during erythroid maturation. Lastly, as splice factor mutations occur in clonal hematopoiesis (CH) with increased risk of neoplastic transformation, we applied GoT-Splice to CH samples. These data revealed that the erythroid lineage bias, as well as cell-type specific cryptic 3 splice site usage in SF3B1mut cells, precede overt MDS. Collectively, we present an expanded multi-omics single-cell toolkit to define the cell-type specific impact of somatic mutations on RNA splicing, from the earliest phases of clonal outgrowths to overt neoplasia, directly in human samples.",

However, because ribosome display is typically performed with standard in vitro translation reagents, the ability to display proteins with complex post-translational modifications such as glycosylation is limited. To address this technological gap, here we developed a set of complementary methods for producing stalled ribosome complexes that displayed asparagine-linked (N-linked) glycoproteins in conformations amenable to downstream functional and glyco-structural interrogation. The ability to generate glycosylated ribosome-nascent chain (glycoRNC) complexes was enabled by integrating SecM-mediated translation arrest with methods for cell-free synthesis of N-glycoproteins. This integration yielded a novel capability for translating and displaying target proteins modified efficiently and site-specifically with different N-glycan structures. Moreover, the encoding mRNAs remained stably attached to stalled ribosomes both before and after biopanning, thereby providing the genotype- glycophenotype link between an arrested glycoprotein and its RNA message. We anticipate that our method will enable selection and evolution of N-linked glycoproteins with advantageous biological and biophysical properties.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia with progressive cognitive deficits and mood disorders (Knopman et al., 2021). Recent studies have associated AD pathology with the impairment of adult neurogenesis, as indicated by impaired neural stem cell (NSCs) homeostasis (Bond et al., 2015). Recent work has further associated AD progression with a decline in the number and maturation of adult-born neurons in the SGZ, distinct from typical age-related decline (Moreno-Jimenez et al., 2019). In 3xTG-AD mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, our and other groups have demonstrated impairments to NSC pool and neural progenitor proliferation, as well as adult-born neurons, before the onset of A{beta} plaques and NFTs (Hamilton et al., 2010, 2015; Rodriguez et al., 2008, 2009). However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying the functional impairment of adult NSCs remain to be resolved. Here, we employ single-cell RNA-Seq to establish population-specific defects in the 3xTG-AD mouse model during adult SGZ neurogenesis. Relative to control mice, we observe a dramatic AD-induced decrease in the primed and activated NSC population, which results in a progressive loss of cells committed to neurogenesis. Transcriptome measurements suggest that 3xTG-AD NSCs and their progeny represent enhanced ribosomal and mitochondrial biogenesis, and disturbed Notch signaling pathway. RNA velocity analysis reveals reduced NSC activation as evidenced by a large fraction of Ascl1-postive cells, instead of entering cell cycle, returning to the primed and quiescent state. This is further supported by reduced numbers of Lpar1-expressing cells, a marker of neural progenitor cells, in the SGZ.

    "abstract": "Cells rely on activity-dependent protein-protein interactions to convey biological signals, but the state-dependent interactome is notoriously cell-specific and undercharacterized1. In the case of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells containing a 4-1BB costimulatory domain, receptor engagement is thought to trigger the formation of protein complexes similar to those triggered by T cell receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling, but the number and type of protein-interaction-mediating binding domains differ between CARs and TCRs. Here, we performed co-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry of a 2nd generation CD19-directed 4-1BB:zeta CAR (referred to as bb{zeta}CAR) and identified 67 proteins that increased their co-association after target engagement. We compared activity-induced TCR and CAR signalosomes using quantitative multiplex co-immunoprecipitation and showed that bb{zeta}CAR engagement leads to activation of two modules of protein interactions, one similar to TCR signaling that is more weakly engaged in bb{zeta}CAR vs. TCR, and one composed of TRAF signaling complexes that is not engaged by the TCR. Batch-to-batch and inter-individual variations in IL2 production correlated with differences in the magnitude of protein network activation. Future CAR T cell manufacturing protocols could measure, and eventually control, biological variation by monitoring these signalosome activation markers.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe define a network of protein interactions engaged by chimeric antigen receptors following target binding, and show that the magnitude of network activation correlates with IL-2 secretion, a proxy measure for CAR T cell function.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a newly emerged beta-coronavirus that enter cells via two routes, direct fusion at the plasma membrane or endocytosis followed by fusion with the late endosome/lysosome. While the viral receptor, ACE2, multiple entry factors, and the mechanism of fusion of the virus at the plasma membrane have been extensively investigated, viral entry via the endocytic pathway is less understood. By using a human hepatocarcinoma cell line, Huh-7, which is resistant to the antiviral action of the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat, we discovered that SARS-CoV-2 entry is not dependent on dynamin but dependent on cholesterol. ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) has been described as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 replication and it is involved in the entry and infection of several pathogenic viruses. Using CRISPR-Cas9 genetic deletion, we observed that ARF6 is important for SARS-CoV-2 uptake and infection in Huh-7. This finding was corroborated using a pharmacologic inhibitor, whereby the ARF6 inhibitor NAV-2729 showed a dose-dependent inhibition of viral infection. Importantly, NAV-2729 reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral loads also in more physiologic models of infection: Calu-3 and kidney organoids. This highlighted the importance of ARF6 in multiple cell contexts. Together, these experiments points to ARF6 as a putative target to develop antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays a crucial role in the mucosal immunity for preventing the invasion of the exogenous antigens, however, little has been understood about the neutralizing activity of serum IgA. Here, to examine the role of IgA antibodies against COVID-19 illnesses, we determined the neutralizing activity of serum/plasma IgG and IgA purified from previously SARS-CoV-2-infected and COVID-19 mRNA-vaccine-receiving individuals. We found that serum/plasma IgA possesses substantial but rather modest neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 compared to IgG with no significant correlation with the disease severity. Neutralizing IgA and IgG antibodies achieved the greatest activity at approximately 25 and 35 days after symptom onset, respectively. However, neutralizing IgA activity quickly diminished and went down below the detection limit approximately 70 days after onset, while substantial IgG activity was observed till 200 days after onset. The total neutralizing activity in sera/plasmas of those with COVID-19 largely correlated with that in purified-IgG and purified-IgA and levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding IgG and anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding IgA. In individuals who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 but had no detectable neutralizing IgA activity, a single dose of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 elicited potent serum/plasma neutralizing IgA activity but the second dose did not further strengthen the neutralization antibody response. The present data show that the systemic immune stimulation with natural infection and COVID-19 mRNA-vaccines elicit both SARS-CoV-2-specific neutralizing IgG and IgA response in serum, but the IgA response is modest and diminishes faster compared to IgG response.\n\nAuthor SummaryImmunoglobulin A (IgA) is the most abundant type of antibody in the body mostly located on mucosal surfaces as a dimeric secretory IgA. Such secretory IgA plays an important role in preventing the adherence and invasions of foreign objects by its neutralizing activity, while monomeric serum IgA is thought to relate to the phagocytic immune system activation. Here, we report that individuals with the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) developed both systemic neutralizing IgG and IgA active against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the neutralizing IgA response was quick and reached the highest activity 25 days post-symptom-onset, compared to 35 days for IgG response, neutralizing IgA activity was modest and diminished faster than neutralizing IgG response. In individuals, who recovered from COVID-19 but had no detectable neutralizing IgA activity, a single dose of COVID-19 mRNA-vaccine elicited potent neutralizing IgA activity but the second dose did not further strengthen the antibody response. Our study provides novel insights into the role and the kinetics of serum IgA against the viral pathogen both in naturally-infected and COVID-19 mRNA-vaccine-receiving COVID-19-convalescent individuals.",

    "abstract": "The formation of viroplasms is a well-conserved step in the rotavirus (RV) life cycle. In these structures, both virus genome replication and progeny assembly take place. A stabilized microtubule cytoskeleton and lipid droplets are required for the viroplasm formation, which involves several virus proteins. The viral spike protein VP4 has not previously been shown to have a direct role in viroplasm formation. However, it is involved with virus-cell attachment, endocytic internalization, and virion morphogenesis. Moreover, VP4 interacts with actin cytoskeleton components, mainly in processes involving virus entrance and egress, and thereby may have an indirect role in viroplasm formation. In this study, we used reverse genetics to construct a recombinant RV, rRV/VP4-BAP, which contains a biotin acceptor peptide (BAP) in the K145-G150 loop of the VP4 lectin domain, permitting live monitoring. The recombinant virus was replication competent but showed a reduced fitness. We demonstrate that rRV/VP4-BAP infection, as opposed to rRV/wt infection, did not lead to a reorganized actin cytoskeleton as viroplasms formed were insensitive to drugs that depolymerize actin and inhibit myosin. Moreover, wt VP4, but not VP4-BAP, appeared to associate with actin filaments. Similarly, VP4 in co-expression with NSP5 and NSP2 induced a significant increase in the number of viroplasm-like structures. Interestingly, a small peptide mimicking loop K145-G150 rescued the phenotype of rRV/VP4-BAP by increasing its ability to form viroplasms and hence, improve virus progeny formation. Collectively, these results provide a direct link between VP4 and the actin cytoskeleton to catalyze viroplasm assembly.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe spike protein VP4 participates in diverse steps of the rotavirus (RV) life cycle, including virus-cell attachment, internalization, modulation of endocytosis, virion morphogenesis, and virus egress. Using reverse genetics, we constructed for the first time a recombinant RV, rRV/VP4-BAP, harboring a heterologous peptide in the lectin domain (loop K145-G150) of VP4. The rRV/VP4-BAP was replication-competent but with reduced fitness due to a defect in the ability to reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, which affected the efficiency of viroplasm assembly. This defect was rescued by adding a permeable small-peptide mimicking the wild-type VP4 loop K145-G150. In addition to revealing a new role of VP4, our findings suggest that rRV harboring an engineered VP4 could be used as a new dual vaccination platform providing immunity against RV and additional heterologous antigens.",

The path ensemble showed the mechanism of how a highly flexible peptide folded into the bound form. At the early stage, the dominant motion was the diffusion on the protein surface showing a broad distribution, whose center was led into the cleft of the Chymotrypsin fold. We observed a definite sequential formation of the hydrogen bonds at the later stage occurring in the cleft, initiated between Glu166 (3CLpro) and P3_Val (peptide), followed by binding to the oxyanion hole and completed by the sequencespecific recognition at P1_Gln.",

    "abstract": "Despite its ecological flexibility and geographical co-occurrence with human pathogens, little is known about the ability for Anopheles albimanus to transmit arboviruses. To address this gap, we challenged An. albimanus females with four alphaviruses and one flavivirus and monitored progression of infections. We found this species is an efficient vector of the alphaviruses Mayaro virus, Onyong-nyong virus, and Sindbis virus, though the latter two do not currently exist in its habitat range. An. albimanus was able to become infected with Chikungunya virus, but virus dissemination was rare (indicating the presence of a midgut escape barrier), and no mosquito transmitted. Mayaro virus rapidly established disseminated infections in An. albimanus females and was detected in the saliva of a substantial proportion of infected mosquitoes. Consistent with previous work in other anophelines, we find that An. albimanus is refractory to infection with flaviviruses, a phenotype that did not depend on midgut-specific barriers. Our work demonstrates that An. albimanus may be a vector of neglected emerging human pathogens and adds to recent evidence that anophelines are competent vectors for diverse arboviruses.",

    "abstract": "Programmed cell suicide of infected bacteria, known as abortive infection (Abi), serves as a central immune defense strategy to prevent the spread of bacteriophage viruses and other invasive genetic elements across a population. Many Abi systems utilize bespoke cyclic nucleotide immune messengers generated upon infection to rapidly mobilize cognate death effectors. Here, we identify a large family of bacteriophage nucleotidyltransferases (NTases) that synthesize competitor cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) ligands, inhibiting NAD-depleting TIR effectors activated by a linked STING CDN sensor domain. Virus NTase genes are positioned within genomic regions containing other anti-defense genes, and through a functional screen, we uncover candidate anti-TIR defense (Atd) genes that confer protection against TIR-STING cytotoxicity. We show that a virus MazG-like nucleotide pyrophosphatase identified in the screen, Atd1, depletes the starvation alarmone (p)ppGpp, revealing a role for the alarmone-activated host toxin MazF as a key executioner of TIR-directed abortive infection. Phage NTases and counter-defenses like Atd1 preserve host viability to ensure virus propagation, and may be exploited as tools to modulate TIR and STING immune responses.",

We further synthesized several analogs of C346, and found that its analog, G42, also mobilized Ca2+ release from lysosomes. G42 alkalized lysosomal pH, and inhibited autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Moreover, G42 markedly inhibited Zika virus (ZIKV, a flavivirus) or murine hepatitis virus (MHV, a {beta}-coronavirus) infections of host cells.

    "abstract": "Cytoadherence and consequential migration are crucial for pathogens to establish colonization in the host. In contrast to the nonadherent isolate of Trichomonas vaginalis, the adherent one expresses more actin-related machinery proteins with more active flagellate-amoeboid morphogenesis, amoeba migration, and cytoadherence, activities that were abrogated by an actin assembly blocker. By immunoprecipitation coupled with label-free quantitative proteomics, an F-actin capping protein (TvFACP) was identified from the actin-centric interactome, with an atypically greater binding preference to G-actin than F-actin. TvFACP partially colocalized with F-actin at the parasite pseudopodia protrusion and formed the protein complexes with -actin through its c-terminal domain. Meanwhile, TvFACP overexpression suppresses F-actin polymerization, amoeboid morphogenesis, and cytoadherence in this parasite. Ser2 phosphorylation of TvFACP enriched in the amoeboid stage of adhered trophozoites was reduced by a CKII inhibitor. The site-directed mutagenesis and CKII inhibitor treatment revealed that Ser2 phosphorylation acts as a switching signal to alter TvFACP actin-binding activity and consequent actin cytoskeleton behaviors. Through CKII signaling, TvFACP also controls the conversion of adherent trophozoite from amoeboid migration to flagellate form with axonemal motility. Together, CKII-dependent Ser2 phosphorylation regulates TvFACP binding actin to fine-tune cytoskeleton dynamics and drive crucial behaviors underlying host colonization of T. vaginalis.",

Endosomal cathepsins can carry out both. Using real-time 3D single virion tracking, we show fusion and genome penetration requires virion exposure to an acidic milieu of pH 6.2-6.8, even when furin and TMPRSS2 cleavages have occurred. We detect the sequential steps of S1-fragment dissociation, fusion, and content release from the cell surface in TMPRRS2 overexpressing cells only when exposed to acidic pH. We define a key role of an acidic environment for successful infection, found in endosomal compartments and at the surface of TMPRSS2 expressing cells in the acidic milieu of the nasal cavity.\n\nSignificance StatementInfection by SARS-CoV-2 depends upon the S large spike protein decorating the virions and is responsible for receptor engagement and subsequent fusion of viral and cellular membranes allowing release of virion contents into the cell. Using new single particle imaging tools, to visualize and track the successive steps from virion attachment to fusion, combined with chemical and genetic perturbations of the cells, we provide the first direct evidence for the cellular uptake routes of productive infection in multiple cell types and their dependence on proteolysis of S by cell surface or endosomal proteases.

Neutralizing antibodies are more likely to reflect real immunity, however certain of these tests investigate protein/protein interaction rather than the fusion event. Viral and pseudoviral entry assays detect functionally active antibodies, however they are cumbersome and burdened by biosafety and standardization issues. We have developed a Spike/ACE2-dependant cell-to-cell fusion assay, based on a split luciferase. Hela cells stably transduced with Spike and a large fragment of luciferase were co-cultured with Hela cells transduced with ACE2 and the complementary small fragment of luciferase. Within 24h, cell fusion occured allowing the measurement of luminescence. Light emission was abolished in the absence of Spike and reduced in the presence of an inhibitor of Spike-processing proteases. Serum samples from COVID-19-negative, non-vaccinated individuals, or sera from patients at the moment of first symptoms did not lead to a significant reduction of fusion. In contrast, sera from COVID-19-positive patients as well as sera from vaccinated individuals reduced the fusion. In conclusion, we report a new method measuring fusion-inhibitory antibodies in serum, combining the advantage of a functional full Spike/ACE2 interaction with a high degree of standardization, easily allowing automation in a standard bio-safety environment.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR-Cas9 method for generation of knock-in mutations in a rodent embryo yields many F0 generation candidates that may have the designed mutations. Genetic mutations must be confirmed using genomic DNA with a mixture of designed and unexpected mutations. In our study for establishing Prlhr-Venus knock-in reporter mice, we found that genomic rearrangements near the targeted knock-in allele, tandem multicopy at a target allele locus and mosaic genotype of two different knock-in alleles occurred in addition to the designed knock-in mutation in the F0 generation. Conventional PCR and genomic sequencing were not able to detect mosaicism or discriminate between the designed one-copy knock-in mutant and a multicopy-inserted mutant. However, by using a combination of Southern blotting and the next-generation sequencing-based RAISING method, these mutants were successfully detected in the F0 generation. In F1 and F2 generations, droplet digital PCR analysis contributed to establishment of the strain, although a multicopy was falsely detected as one copy by the analysis in the F0 generation. We emphasize that the combination of these five methods allowed us to select promising F0 generations and establish the designed strain and that focusing only on positive evidence of knock-in can lead to erroneous selection of undesirable strains.",

    "abstract": "Many situations require focusing attention on one speaker, while monitoring the environment for potentially important information. Some have proposed that dividing attention among two speakers involves behavioral tradeoffs, due to limited cognitive resources. However the severity of these tradeoffs, particularly under ecologically-valid circumstances, is not well understood. We investigated the capacity to process simultaneous speech using a dual-task paradigm simulating task demands and stimuli encountered in real-life. Participants listened to conversational narratives (Narrative Stream) and monitored a stream of announcements (Barista Stream), to detect when their order was called. We measured participants performance, neural activity and skin conductance as they engaged in this dual-task.\n\nParticipants achieved extremely high dual-task accuracy, with no apparent behavioral tradeoffs. Moreover, robust neural and physiological responses were observed for target-stimuli in the Barista Stream, alongside significant neural speech-tracking of the Narrative Stream. These results suggest that humans have substantial capacity to process simultaneous speech and do not suffer from insufficient processing resources, at least for this highly ecological task-combination and level of perceptual load. Results also confirmed the ecological validity of the advantage for detecting ones own name at the behavioral, neural and physiological level, highlighting the contribution of personal relevance when processing simultaneous speech.",

    "abstract": "Background and ObjectivesMotor learning experiments with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at 2mA have produced mixed results. We hypothesize that tDCS will boost motor learning provided sufficiently high field intensity on the motor cortex.\n\nMethodsIn a single-blinded, between-subject design, 72 healthy right-handed participants received either anodal or cathodal tDCS at 4mA while they learned to perform a sequence of key presses using their non-dominant hand for about 12 minutes. Cathodal stimulation served as an active control for sensation. A separate sham-stimulation group established baseline performance. Gains during practice and rest periods were analyzed (called micro-online and -offline learning). The target for stimulation was identified on the motor cortex using fMRI. After optimization with individual current flow models, we selected a single montage for all 108 participants with 4 frontal and 4 parietal electrodes each drawing 1mA.\n\nResultsWe found significant gains in performance with anodal stimulation (Cohens d=0.7). The boost in performance persisted for at least one hour. Subsequent learning for a new sequence and the opposite hand also improved. Concurrent tDCS enhanced micro-offline learning, while subsequent learning relied on micro-online gains. Sensation ratings were comparable in the active groups and did not exceed moderate levels. The new electrode montage achieved a better tradeoff between stimulation intensity and sensations on the scalp as compared to alternative montages.\n\nConclusionThe present paradigm shows reliable behavioral effects at 4mA and is well-tolerated. It may serve as a go-to experiment for future studies on motor learning and tDCS.\n\nHighlightsO_LItDCS resulted in a lasting boost of concurrent learning with effect size of Cohens d=0.7.\nC_LIO_LISubsequent learning was also improved, indicating a form of meta-learning.\nC_LIO_LIDetailed analysis of behavior suggests an effect of tDCS on sequence consolidation.\nC_LIO_LIA novel electrode montage with 1mA through each of 4+4 electrodes was well-tolerated.\nC_LI",

However, the complete repertoire of m6A-modified RNA interacting RBPs in the synaptic compartment, and whether they are involved in fear extinction, have yet to be revealed. Using RNA immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry, we discovered 12 novel, synapsespecific, learning-induced m6A readers in the medial prefrontal cortex of male C57/B6 mice. m6A RNA-sequencing also revealed a unique population of learning-related m6A-modified RNAs at the synapse, which includes a variant of the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1). m6A-modified Malat1 binds to a subset of novel m6A readers, including cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) and dihydropyrimidase-related protein 2 (DPYSL2) and a cell-type-specific, state-dependent, and synapse-specific reduction in m6A-modified Malat1 disrupts the interaction between Malat1 and DPYSL2 and impairs fear extinction. The consolidation of fear-extinction memory therefore relies on an interaction between m6A-modified Malat1 and select RBPs in the synaptic compartment.",

    "abstract": "Previous research in the field of personality neuroscience has identified associations of conscientiousness and related constructs like impulsivity and self-control with structural and functional properties of particular regions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and insula. Network- based conceptions of brain function suggest that these regions probably belong to a single large- scale network, labeled the salience/ventral attention network (SVAN). The current study tested associations between conscientiousness and resting-state functional connectivity in this network using two community samples (N = 244 and 239) and data from the Human Connectome Project (N = 1000). Individualized parcellation was used to improve the accuracy of functional localization and to facilitate replication. Functional connectivity was measured using an index of network efficiency, a graph theoretical measure quantifying the capacity for parallel information transfer within a network. Efficiency of a set of parcels in the SVAN was significantly associated with conscientiousness in all samples. Findings are consistent with a theory of conscientiousness as a function of variation in neural networks underlying effective prioritization of goals.",

Two behavioral features, motivation and working memory (WM), play a role in DM capacities although the precise relationship is not entirely known. Additionally, we previously reported that neurotransmitters e.g., dopamine - modulation was tightly linked to the PD phenotype. The goal of the study was to investigate the detailed motivational functions in PD individuals including saccharin intake, reward-seeking or incentive behaviors under different internal states i.e., food-deprived or ad libitum. Maze-based spatial WM was also evaluated. Moreover, two inbred strains of rats, Lewis and Fisher 344 (F344) rats, known for modeling vulnerability to drug addiction and affected by substantial variations in the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, were run in the DM task (Rat Gambling Task, RGT). PD Wistar Han rats displayed higher saccharin intake levels and a drastic increased reward-seeking behavior on a fixed schedule. PD were more sensitive to the internal state in responding to saccharin delivery in fixed but not in progressive schedules. A few relationships were found within motivational functions, and with DM, that is a positive correlation between saccharin intake and reward-seeking behavior, and a negative correlation between saccharin intake and DM. PD were significantly not impaired in WM. Lewis and F344 rats displayed improved performance early in the task (exploration) and a higher proportion of PD was observed in Lewis as compared to F344 rats. Altogether, these findings complete the preclinical panel of behavioral functions that relate to poor DM and extend a presumed role of dopamine in such processes.",

    "abstract": "Moving effectively is essential for any animal. Thats why many different kinds of brain processes likely contribute to learning and adapting movement. How these contributions are combined to shape behavior is unknown. Nevertheless, the field of motor adaptation has been working under the assumption that measures of explicit and implicit motor adaptation can simply be added in total adaptation - without testing this assumption. Here we put this additivity assumption to the test in various ways, but we find that measures of implicit and explicit adaptation are not additive. This means that future studies should measure both implicit and explicit adaptation directly. It also challenges us to disentangle how various motor adaptation processes combine when producing movements, and may have implications for our understanding of other kinds of learning as well.(data and code: https://osf.io/kr5eh)",

    "abstract": "There is a critical need to develop vaccine adjuvants that induce robust immune responses able to protect against intracellular pathogens, including viruses. Previously, we described the virus-derived adjuvant, defective viral genome-derived oligonucleotide (DDO), as a strong inducer of type 1 immune responses, including protective Th1 CD4+ T-cells and effector CD8+ T-cells in mice. Here we unravel the early innate response required for this type 1 immunity induction. Upon DDO subcutaneous injection, type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) accumulate rapidly in the draining lymph node in a type I interferon (IFN)-dependent manner. cDC1 accumulation in the lymph node is required for antigen-specific CD8+ T-cell responses. Notably, in contrast to poly I:C, DDO administration resulted in type I IFN expression at the injection site, but not in the draining lymph node. Additionally, DDO induced an inflammatory cytokine profile distinct from that induced by poly I:C. Therefore, DDO represent a powerful new adjuvant to be used during vaccination against intracellular pathogens.\n\nIMPORTANCEThere is a paucity of vaccine adjuvants able to trigger effective and safe protective responses to many intracellular pathogens. Defining the minimal requirements to achieve type 1 immunity, which includes antigen specific CD8+ T cells capable of eliminating infected cells, is essential for the development of adjuvants that lead to optimal protective immune responses during vaccination against intracellular pathogens. We use a virus-derived immunostimulatory molecule, defective viral genome-derived oligonucleotide (DDO), to provide insights into how type 1 immune responses are triggered during vaccination using an inactivated influenza vaccine model. Understanding the mechanism of action of vaccine adjuvants not only aids in the advancement of vaccine development, but also in understanding specific immune pathways required for efficient induction of adaptive immune responses to infections.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria can acquire mobile genetic elements (MGEs) to combat infection by viruses (phages). Satellite viruses, including the PLEs (phage-inducible chromosomal island-like elements) in epidemic Vibrio cholerae, are MGEs that restrict phage replication to the benefit of their host bacterium. PLEs parasitize the lytic phage ICP1, unleashing multiple mechanisms to restrict phage replication and promote their own spread. In the arms race against PLE, ICP1 uses nucleases, including CRISPR-Cas, to destroy PLEs genome during infection. However, through an unknown CRISPR-independent mechanism, specific ICP1 isolates subvert restriction by PLE. Here, we discover ICP1-encoded Adi that counteracts PLE by exploiting the PLEs large serine recombinase (LSR), which normally mobilizes PLE in response to ICP1 infection. Unlike previously characterized ICP1-encoded anti-PLE mechanisms, Adi is not a nuclease itself but instead appears to modulate the activity of the LSR to promote destructive nuclease activity of the LSRs specific attachment site, attP. The PLE LSR, its catalytic activity, and attP are additionally sufficient to sensitize a PLE encoding a resistant variant of the recombination module to Adi activity. This work highlights a unique type of adaptation arising from inter-genome conflicts, in which the intended activity of a protein can be weaponized to overcome the antagonizing genome.",

Numerous clinical strains harbor a large pathogenicity island that encodes enterococcal surface protein (Esp), which is suggested to promote biofilm production and virulence, but this remains controversial. To resolve this issue, we characterized the Esp N-terminal region, the portion implicated in biofilm production. Small angle X-ray scattering indicated that the N-terminal region had a globular head, which consisted of two DEv-Ig domains as visualized by X-ray crystallography, followed by an extended tail. The N-terminal region was not required for biofilm production but instead significantly strengthened biofilms against mechanical or degradative disruption, greatly increasing retention of Enterococcus within biofilms. Biofilm strengthening required low pH, which resulted in Esp unfolding, aggregating, and forming amyloid-like structures. The pH threshold for biofilm strengthening depended on protein stability. A truncated fragment of the first DEv-Ig domain, plausibly generated by a host protease, was the least stable and sufficient to strengthen biofilms at pH [&le;] 5.0, while the entire N-terminal region and intact Esp on the enterococcal surface was more stable and required a pH [&le;] 4.3. These results suggested a virulence role of Esp in strengthening enterococcal biofilms in acidic abiotic or host environments.",

Metabolic rewiring is an emergent aspect in the adaptation of bacteria to oxidative stress4, 5. Evolutionarily diverse bacteria combat the toxicity of reactive oxygen species by actively engaging the stringent response6-8, a metabolic program activated at the level of transcription initiation via guanosine tetraphosphate and the -helical DksA protein9. Studies herein with Salmonella demonstrate that the interactions of structurally related, but functionally unique, -helical Gre factors with the secondary channel of RNA polymerase elicit the expression of metabolic signatures that are associated with resistance to oxidative killing. Gre proteins resolve pauses in ternary elongation complexes of Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolysis and aerobic respiration genes. The Gre-directed utilization of glucose in overflow and aerobic metabolism satisfies the energetic and redox demands of Salmonella, while preventing the occurrence of amino acid bradytrophies. Moreover, the simultaneous utilization of lower glycolysis, the methylglyoxal pathway and the electron transport chain curtails the noxious coexistence of reductive and electrophilic stress. The resolution of transcriptional pauses in EMP glycolysis and aerobic respiration genes by Gre factors safeguards Salmonella from the cytotoxicity of phagocyte NADPH oxidase in the innate host response. Control of transcriptional elongation represents a pivotal breakpoint in the regulation of metabolic programs underlying bacterial pathogenesis.",

Despite serving as a valuable tool for the discovery of novel defence systems, the nature and distribution of defence islands themselves remain poorly understood. In this study, we comprehensively mapped the repertoire of defence islands within >1,300 strains of Escherichia coli, the most widely studied organism in terms of phage-bacteria interactions. We found that defence islands preferentially integrate at several dozens of dedicated integration hotspots in the E. coli genome. Defence islands are usually carried on mobile genetic elements including prophages, integrative conjugative elements and transposons, as well as on other genetic elements whose nature of mobilisation is unclear. Each type of mobile genetic element has a preferred integration position but can carry a diverse variety of defensive cargo. On average, an E. coli genome has 4.5 genomic hotspots occupied by a defence system-containing mobile element, with some strains possessing up to eight defensively occupied hotspots. Our data show that the overwhelming majority of the E. coli pan-immune system is carried on mobile genetic elements that integrate at a discrete set of genomic hotspots, and explains why the immune repertoire substantially varies between different strains of the same species.",

    "abstract": "Classical observations have long suggested there is a link between 3D gene structure and transcription1-4. However, due to the many factors regulating gene expression, and to the challenge of visualizing DNA and chromatin dynamics at the same time in living cells, this hypothesis has been difficult to quantitatively test experimentally. Here we take an orthogonal approach and use computer simulations, based on the known biophysical principles of genome organisation5-7, to simultaneously predict 3D structure and transcriptional output of human chromatin genome wide. We validate our model by quantitative comparison with Hi-C contact maps, FISH, GRO-seq and single-cell RNA-seq data, and provide the 3DGene resource to visualise the panoply of structures adopted by any active human gene in a population of cells. We find transcription strongly correlates with the formation of protein-mediated microphase separated clusters of promoters and enhancers, associated with clouds of chromatin loops, and show that gene noise is a consequence of structural heterogeneity. Our results also indicate that loop extrusion by cohesin does not affect average transcriptional patterns, but instead impacts transcriptional noise. These findings provide a functional role for intranuclear microphase separation, and an evolutionary mechanism for loop extrusion halted at CTCF sites, to modulate transcriptional noise.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylases (HDACs) play a key role in cellular processes by the regulation of gene transcription. This study contributes a novel insight how Plasmodium falciparum HDAC (PfHDAC-1) is regulated by S1P produced by host erythrocyte SphK-1. The binding of S1P with endogenous nuclear extract PfHDAC-1 and recombinant PfHDAC-1 blocks their activity. A significant modulation in transcriptional regulation of P. falciparum HDAC regulated genes resulted upon inhibition of S1P production through blocking of hSphK-1 by clinical SphK-1 inhibitor PF-543. PF-543 led to profound decrease in S1P in the parasites nuclear fraction. The significant modulation of PfHDAC-1 regulated specific candidate genes related to gametocytogenesis, virulence and proliferation was observed in parasite treated with SphK-1 inhibitor, suggesting S1P targets PfHDAC-1 and participates in epigenetic regulation of these key cellular processes. The epigenetic modulation of parasite cell growth and differentiation by host provides a novel approach for the developmenthost-targeted therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Microcystin toxins from harmful algal blooms (HABs) can accumulate and persist in fish, raising dual concerns about human health risks from consumption and the potential for detrimental impacts on fish populations. However, there are fundamental unknowns about the relationship between HABs and fish populations driven by a lack of field information on toxin accumulation and retention over space and time. We conducted a field study to assess human health risks from consuming fish caught across all life stages of a HAB and to determine the pervasiveness of potentially harmful levels of microcystins on fish populations. We collected 190 fish in 2015 and 2017 from Lake Erie, a large freshwater ecosystem that is highly productive for fisheries and is an epicenter of HABs and microcystin toxicity events. Muscles and livers were analyzed for total microcystins, which was used to conduct a human health risk assessment for comparison against fish consumption advisory benchmarks available for Lake Erie. We find low human health risk from muscle consumption following the World Health Organizations safety thresholds. However, all fish across capture dates had microcystins in their livers at levels shown to cause adverse effects, suggesting a pervasive and underappreciated toxic stressor. These data demonstrate that microcystins are retained in fish livers well beyond the cessation of HABs and calls for additional research to better understand the effects of sublethal toxic exposures for fish population dynamics, conservation, and related ecosystem services.",

    "abstract": "Many animal species employ short, positively charged proteins, called sperm nuclear basic proteins (SNBPs) or protamines, for tighter packaging of genomes in sperm. SNBP repertoires differ dramatically across animal lineages and signatures of rapid evolution have been reported in mammals. Both sperm competition and meiotic drive between sex chromosomes have been proposed as causes of SNBP innovation. We used a phylogenomic approach to investigate SNBP diversification and its underlying causes in Drosophila species. We found unambiguous signatures of positive selection in most SNBP genes except for genes essential for male fertility in D. melanogaster. Unexpectedly, evolutionarily young SNBP genes are more likely to encode essential functions for fertility than ancient, conserved SNBP genes like CG30056, which we found is dispensable for male fertility despite universal retention in Drosophila species. We found 19 independent amplification events involving eight SNBP genes that occurred preferentially on sex chromosomes in 78 Drosophila species. Conversely, we found that otherwise-conserved SNBP genes were lost in the montium group of Drosophila species, coincident with an X-Y chromosomal fusion. Furthermore, SNBP genes that became linked to sex chromosomes via chromosomal fusions are prone to degenerate or relocate back to autosomes. We hypothesize that SNBP genes ancestrally encoded by autosomes suppress meiotic drive, whereas sex-chromosomal SNBP expansions directly participate in meiotic drive. X-Y fusions in the montium group render autosomal SNBPs dispensable by making X-versus-Y meiotic drive obsolete or costly. We conclude that SNBP rapid evolution is driven by genetic conflicts between sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis in Drosophila species.",

The study included twenty-one gymnasts and twenty-one swimmers. The ACE and IL6 genes were genotyped by PCR and polyacrylamide electrophoresis, the ACTN3 gene was genotyped by PCR-RFLP. In the ACE gene, a greater number of genotypes with the D allele was observed in both sports, for the ACTN3 gene a predominance of the RX genotype was observed in both gymnastics and swimming, in the IL6 gene the most predominant characteristic is the total absence of the CC genotype. For the ACE gene, the highest allelic frequency is that of the D allele in both sports, the IL6 gene shows a high presence of the G allele, for the ACTN3 gene, in gymnastics the highest frequency of carriers is observed in the R allele and for the sport of swimming the majority is carrying the X allele. Significant differences were observed when comparing the genotypic and allelic frequencies between the population of gymnasts and swimmers only in the ACTN3 gene, the ACE gene and IL6 did not present significant differences between the populations. In conclusion, the genotypes presented by the athletes correspond to the types of efforts of their sport, gymnastics with predominance in strength and power and swimming with an orientation towards both phenotypes, showing a pleiotropic effect of the ACE and ACTN3 genes.",

To improve understanding of the evolution of this iconic fish group, we generated and analysed new genome assemblies for 24 species covering all major subgroups of the radiation. We present a new estimate for the onset of the radiation at 10.7 million years ago, based on a time-calibrated phylogeny derived from genome-wide sequence data. We identify a two-fold variation in genome size, driven by expansion of multiple transposable element families, and use long-read sequencing data to reconstruct two evolutionarily important, highly repetitive gene family loci. First, we present the most complete reconstruction to date of the antifreeze glycoprotein gene family, whose emergence enabled survival in sub-zero temperatures, showing the expansion of the antifreeze gene locus from the ancestral to the derived state. Second, we trace the loss of haemoglobin genes in icefishes, the only vertebrates lacking functional haemoglobins, through complete reconstruction of the two haemoglobin gene clusters across notothenioid families. Finally, we show that both the haemoglobin and antifreeze genomic loci are characterised by multiple transposon expansions that may have driven the evolutionary history of these genes.",

The pathophysiology consists of a prominent inflammatory component that can be targeted to prevent cartilage degradation and structural defects. Intracellular metabolism has emerged as a culprit of the inflammatory response in chondrocytes, with both processes co-regulating each other. The role of glutamine metabolism in chondrocytes, especially in the context of inflammation, lacks a thorough understanding and is the focus of this work. We display that chondrocytes utilize glutamine for energy production and anabolic processes. Furthermore, we show that glutamine deprivation itself causes metabolic reprogramming and decreases the inflammatory response of chondrocytes through inhibition of NF-{kappa}B activity. Finally, we display that glutamine deprivation promotes autophagy and that ammonia is an inhibitor of autophagy. Overall, we identify a relationship between glutamine metabolism and inflammatory signaling and display the need for increased study of chondrocyte metabolic systems.",

Although much attention has been focused on the thermodynamics of DNA and RNA base pairing in the scientific literature, much less work has been done on the time dependence of interactions involving multiple strands, especially in RNA. Here we provide a study of oligoribonucleotide interaction kinetics and show that it is possible to calculate the association, dissociation and strand displacement rates displayed by short oligonucleotides (5nt - 12nt) as simple functions of oligonucleotide length, CG content, {Delta}G of hybridization and {Delta}G of toehold binding. We then show that the resultant calculated kinetic parameters are consistent with the experimentally observed time dependent changes in concentrations of the different species present in mixtures of multiple competing RNA strands. We show that by changing the mixture composition, it is possible to create and tune kinetic traps that extend by orders of magnitude the typical sub-second hybridization timescale of two complementary oligonucleotides. We suggest that the slow equilibration of complex oligonucleotide mixtures may have facilitated the nonenzymatic replication of RNA during the origin of life.",

Clinical success of CRISPR technology is dependent on incorporation of modifications into the single guide RNA (sgRNA).

We developed a conjugation strategy that utilized bio-orthogonal chemistry to efficiently assemble functional sgRNAs containing nucleobase modifications. The described approach entails the chemical synthesis of two shorter RNA oligonucleotides: a 31-mer containing tetrazine (Tz) group and a 70-mer modified with a trans-cyclooctene (TCO) moiety. The two oligonucleotides were conjugated to form functional sgRNAs. The two-component conjugation methodology was utilized to synthesize a library of sgRNAs containing nucleobase modifications such as m1A, m6A, s2U and s4U. The impacts of these RNA modifications on overall CRISPR activity was investigated in vitro and in Cas9-expressing HEK293T cells.",

It has diverse phenotypes, including diffuse single-cell infiltration in which the tumor cells co-opt the normal microvasculature, and the neovascularization of an expanding tumor mass. The blood-brain-tumor barrier (BBTB) is a significant obstacle to GBM treatment and restricts entry of most FDA-approved effective oncology drugs. Herein, we report that picosecond laser excitation of vascular-targeted plasmonic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) can non-invasively and reversibly modulate the BBTB permeability (optoBBTB). OptoBBTB enhances the delivery of paclitaxel (Taxol) in two genetically engineered glioma models (GEMM) that span the spectrum of GBM phenotypes. OptoBBTB followed by Taxol delivery effectively suppresses tumor growth and prolongs the survival time of both GEMM. Moreover, our results raise the possibility that paclitaxel, which is amongst the most widely used oncology drugs because of its proven efficacy but has been abandoned for GBM following its failure to efficacy in early phase clinical trials due to poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, could now be reconsidered in combination with strategies to increase BBB permeability. In summary, optoBBTB is a novel and effective approach to increase the delivery of therapeutics with limited BBB permeability to treat neoplastic and non-neoplastic brain diseases.",

This is achieved by combining IBLTs with k-mer sampling based on syncmers, which constitute a context-independent alternative to minimizers and provide an unbiased estimator of Jaccard similarity. A key property of our method is that involved data structures require space proportional to the difference of k-mer sets and are independent of the size of sets themselves. As another application, we show how our ideas can be applied in order to efficiently compute (an approximation of) k-mers that differ between two datasets, still using space only proportional to their number.

    "abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) data linked to DNA biobanks are a valuable resource for understanding the phenotypic effects of human genetic variation. We previously developed the phenotype risk score (PheRS) as an approach to quantify the extent to which a patients clinical features resemble a given Mendelian disease. Using PheRS, we have uncovered novel associations between Mendelian diseaselike phenotypes and rare genetic variants, and identified patients who may have undiagnosed Mendelian disease. Although the PheRS approach is conceptually simple, it involves multiple mapping steps and was previously only available as custom scripts, limiting the approachs usability. Thus, we developed the phers R package, a complete and user-friendly set of functions and maps for performing a PheRS-based analysis on linked clinical and genetic data. The package includes up-to-date maps between EHR-based phenotypes (i.e., ICD codes and phecodes), human phenotype ontology (HPO) terms, and Mendelian diseases. Starting with occurrences of ICD codes, the package enables the user to calculate phenotype risk scores, validate the scores using case-control analyses, and perform genetic association analyses. By increasing PheRSs transparency and usability, the phers R package will help improve our understanding of the relationships between rare genetic variants and clinically meaningful human phenotypes.\n\nAvailabilityThe phers R package is free and open-source, and available on CRAN and at https://phers.hugheylab.org.\n\nContactjakejhughey@gmail.com\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Advances in artificial intelligence have paved the way for leveraging hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tumor slides for precision oncology. We present ENLIGHT-DeepPT, an approach for predicting response to multiple targeted and immunotherapies from H&E-slides. In difference from existing approaches that aim to predict treatment response directly from the slides, ENLIGHT-DeepPT is an indirect two-step approach consisting of (1) DeepPT, a new deep-learning framework that predicts genome-wide tumor mRNA expression from slides, and (2) ENLIGHT, which predicts response based on the DeepPT inferred expression values. DeepPT successfully predicts transcriptomics in all 16 TCGA cohorts tested and generalizes well to two independent datasets. Importantly, ENLIGHT-DeepPT successfully predicts true responders in five independent patients cohorts involving four different treatments spanning six cancer types with an overall odds ratio of 2.44, increasing the baseline response rate by 43.47% among predicted responders, without the need for any treatment data for training. Furthermore, its prediction accuracy on these datasets is comparable to a supervised approach predicting the response directly from the images, trained and tested on the same cohort in cross validation. Its future application could provide clinicians with rapid treatment recommendations to an array of different therapies and importantly, may contribute to advancing precision oncology in developing countries.\n\nStatement of SignificanceENLIGHT-DeepPT is the first approach shown to successfully predict response to multiple targeted and immune cancer therapies from H&E slides. In distinction from all previous H&E slides prediction approaches, it does not require supervised training on a specific cohort for each drug/indication treatment but is trained to predict expression on the TCGA cohort and then can predict response to an array of treatments without any further training. ENLIGHT-DeepPT can provide rapid treatment recommendations to oncologists and help advance precision oncology in underserved regions and low-income countries.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInflammation is undoubtedly a hallmark of cancer development. Its maintenance within tumors and subsequent consequences on disease aggressiveness is less understood.\n\nMethodsMulti-omic analyses of 27 (~ 5000 samples) entities from the TCGA, GEO and in-house data was performed to investigate the molecular determinant of tumor aggressiveness. Using molecular loss of function data, the mechanistic underpinnings of inflammation-induced tumor aggressiveness was addressed.\n\nResultsThe data revealed a significant association between somatic copy number alterations (sCNA) and tumor aggressiveness, with amplification of the transcription factor SOX2 being the most important feature among novel and known aggressiveness-associated genes such as ZIC5 and MYEOV.\n\nMechanistically, SOX2 regulates a group of aggressiveness-related genes including the AP1 transcription factor FOSL2 to sustain pro-inflammatory pathway such as IL6-JAK-STAT3, TNFA and IL17 signaling pathways. Prolonged inflammation induces immunosuppression and further leads to activation of cytidine deamination and consequential DNA damage evidenced by enrichment in cytidine deamination mutational signatures in aggressive tumors.\n\nThe resulting DNA damage affects tumor suppressor genes such as TP53, which was the most mutated gene in aggressive tumors compared with less aggressive tumors (38% vs 14%), thereby releasing cell cycle control. This was exemplified in Glioblastoma multiform, where TP53 and IDH1 mutations are predominant. IDH1 mutations were almost only seen in younger patients (>45 years, > 90%) and may explain the previously reported favorable prognosis.\n\nConclusionTaken together, our data demonstrate the implication of SOX2 in promoting DNA damage and genome instability by sustaining inflammation via FOSL2/IL6, resulting in tumor aggressiveness.",

    "abstract": "Non-motile plants have evolved regulatory mechanisms to maintain homeostasis for optimal growth. Responses to environmental changes in light are particularly important not only during the diurnal transition from night to day but also to react to light changes caused by passing clouds or by wind. Thioredoxins rapidly orchestrate redox control during environmental change by modifying cysteine residues. Here, we assign a function to regulatory cysteines of PGRL1A, a constituent of the ferredoxin-dependent cyclic electron flow (Fd-CEF) pathway and show their role in the regulation of proton motive force (PMF) and nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ). During step increase of low light intensity (10-60 E*m-2*s-1), the intermolecular disulfide of the PGRL1A 59-kDa complex is reduced transiently within seconds to the 28 kDa form. In contrast, step increases to higher light intensity (60-600 E*m-2*s-1) stimulated a stable partially reduced redox state in PGRL1A. Measurements of NPQ, PMF and resultant photosynthetic controls Y(ND) and Y(NA) were found to correlate with the redox state of PGRL1A during step increases in light intensity but not in PGRL1mutant plants pgrl1ab or PGRL1A cysteine mutant (PGRL1AC1,2A). Continuous light regimes did not affect mutant growth; however, fluctuating regimes of light intensity showed significant growth reduction in the mutants. Inhibitors of photosynthesis placed control of the PGRL1A redox state as dependent on the penultimate ferredoxin redox state that fuels reducing equivalents to the large set of chloroplasts thioredoxins. Our results showed that redox state changes in PGRL1A are crucial to the optimization of photosynthesis and are regulated by the photosynthetic electron flux.",

    "abstract": "3D EM connectomics image volumes are now surpassing sizes of 1 mm3, and are therefore beginning to contain multiple meaningful spatial scales of brain circuitry simultaneously. However, the sheer density of information in such datasets makes the development of unbiased, scalable machine learning techniques a necessity for extracting novel insights without extremely time-consuming, intensive labor. In this paper, we present SynapseCLR, a self-supervised contrastive representation learning method for 3D electron microscopy (EM) data, and use the method to extract feature representations of synapses from a 3D EM dataset from mouse visual cortex. We show that our representations separate synapses according to both their overall physical appearance and structural annotations of known functional importance. We further demonstrate the utility of our methodology for several valuable downstream tasks for the growing field of 3D EM connectomics. These include one-shot identification of defective synapse segmentations, dataset-wide similarity-based querying, and accurate imputation of annotations for unlabeled synapses, using only manual annotation of 0.2% of synapses in the dataset. In particular, we show that excitatory vs. inhibitory neuronal cell types can be assigned to individual synapses and highly truncated neurites with accuracy exceeding 99.8%, making this population accessible to connectomics analysis. Finally, we present a data-driven and unsupervised study of the manifold of synaptic structural variation, revealing its intrinsic axes of variation and showing that synapse structure is also strongly correlated with inhibitory neuronal subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Empirical and computational methods were combined to examine whether individual or dual-drug treatments can restore the deficit in long-term synaptic facilitation (LTF) of the Aplysia sensorimotor synapse observed in a molecular model of Coffin-Lowry Syndrome (CLS). The model was produced by pharmacological inhibition of p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) activity. Simultaneous treatment with an activator of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) isoform ERK and an activator of protein kinase A (PKA) resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of RSK and LTF to a greater extent than either drug alone and greater than their additive effects. Indeed, the combined drugs exerted synergistic effects on both RSK activation and LTF, fully restoring RSK phosphorylation and LTF. The extent of synergism appeared to depend on another MAPK isoform, p38 MAPK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK facilitated serotonin (5-HT)-induced RSK phosphorylation, indicating that p38 MAPK inhibits activation of RSK. Inhibition of p38 MAPK combined with activation of PKA synergistically activated RSK.",

    "abstract": "Cre1 is an important transcription factor that regulates carbon catabolite repression (CCR) and is widely conserved across fungi. This gene has been extensively studied in several Ascomycota species, whereas its role in gene expression regulation in the Basidiomycota remains poorly understood. Here, we identified and investigated the role of cre1 in Coprinopsis cinerea, a basidiomycete model mushroom that can efficiently degrade lignocellulosic plant wastes. We used a rapid and efficient gene deletion approach based on PCR-amplified split-marker DNA cassettes together with in-vitro assembled Cas9-guide RNA ribonucleoproteins (Cas9-RNPs) to generate C. cinerea cre1 gene deletion strains. Gene expression profiling of two independent C. cinerea cre1 mutants showed significant deregulation of carbohydrate metabolism, plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs), plasma membrane transporter-related and several transcription factor encoding genes, among others. Our results support the notion that, similarly to reports in the ascomycetes, Cre1 of C. cinerea orchestrates CCR through a combined regulation of diverse genes, including PCWDEs, transcription factors that positively regulate PCWDEs and membrane transporters which could import simple sugars that can induce the expression of PWCDEs. Somewhat paradoxically, though in accordance with other Agaricomycetes, genes related to lignin degradation were mostly downregulated in cre1 mutants, indicating they fall under different regulation than other PCWDEs. The gene deletion approach and the data presented in this paper expand our knowledge of CCR in the Basidiomycota and provide functional hypotheses on genes related to plant biomass degradation.\n\nImportanceMushroom-forming fungi include some of the most efficient degraders of lignocellulosic plant biomass. They degrade dead plant materials by a battery of lignin-, cellulose-, hemicellulose- and pectin-degrading enzymes, the encoding genes of which are under tight transcriptional control. One of the highest-level regulation of these metabolic enzymes is known as carbon catabolite repression, which is orchestrates by the transcription factor Cre1, and ensures that costly lignocellulose-degrading enzyme genes are expressed only when simple carbon sources (e.g. glucose) are not available. Here, we identified the Cre1 ortholog in a litter-decomposer Agaricomycete, Coprinopsis cinerea, knocked it out and characterized transcriptional changes in the mutants. We identified several dozen lignocellulolytic enzyme genes as well as membrane transporters and other transcription factors as putative target genes. These results extend knowledge on carbon catabolite repression to litter decomposer Basidiomycota.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBiomphalaria glabrata is a snail intermediate host for Schistosoma mansoni, a trematode responsible for human schistosomiasis. BS90 is one of the most well studied strains of B. glabrata owing to its high resistance to infection by most strains of S. mansoni. An F2 mapping study from 1999 identified two RAPD markers that associated with what appeared to be single-locus, dominant resistance by the BS90 population relative to the susceptible M-line population. One marker cannot be mapped, but the other, OPM-04, maps to within 5 Mb of PTC2, a region we recently showed has a very large effect on resistance within another snail population challenged by the same strain of parasite (PR1). Here we tested the hypothesis that the PTC2 region contains the causal gene/s that explain the iconic resistance of BS90 snails.\n\nMethodsWe used marker-assisted backcrossing to drive the BS90 version of the PTC2 region (+/-[~] 1 Mb on either side) into an M-line (susceptible strain) genetic background, and the M-line version into a BS90 genetic background. We challenged the offspring with PR1-strain schistosomes and tested for effects of allelic variation in the PTC2 region in a common genetic background.\n\nResultsRelative to M-line haplotypes, the BS90 haplotype actually confers enhanced susceptibility. So we reject our original hypothesis. One possible explanation for our result was that the causal gene linked to OPM-04 is near, but not in the PTC2 block that we introgressed into each line. So we used an F2 cross to independently test the effects of the PTC2 and OPM-04 regions in a randomized genetic background. We confirmed that the BS90 haplotype confers increased susceptibility, and we see a similar, although non-significant effect at OPM-04. We discuss possible reasons why our results differed so dramatically from those of the 1999 study. We also present PacBio assemblies of the PTC2 and flanking region in BS90 and M-line, compare with previously published PTC2 haplotypes, and discuss candidate genes that might be behind the enhanced susceptibility of the BS90 haplotype.",

The micro electrode array fabrication process integrates traditional silicon thin-film processing techniques and direct laser writing of 3D structures at micron resolution via two-photon lithography. While direct laser writing of 3D printed electrodes has been described before, this report is the first to provide a method for high-aspect-ratio laser-written structures integrated with microfabricated electrical traces. One prototype is a 16-channel array composed of 350 m long shanks spaced on a grid with 90 m pitch. Other devices shown here include biomimetic mosquito-needles that penetrate through the dura of birds and porous electrodes designed to promote tissue ingrowth or enhance charge injection capacity for neural stimulation. These devices are just a few examples of a new design space that will enable high-channel-count 3D electrode arrays with features definable at single micrometer resolution. Using a custom laser writer, the 3D printing process is rapid (1 mm3/min). This high-speed printing combined with standard wafer-scale processes will enable efficient device fabrication and new studies examining the relationship between electrode geometry and electrode performance. We anticipate highest impact in small animal models, nerve interfaces, retinal implants, and other applications requiring small, high density 3D electrodes.",

However, its characteristics and functions in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain largely unknown.

Transcriptome analysis revealed that a major fraction of the hypermethylated genes participated in the phosphokinase signaling pathways, such as the Ras and PI3K-Akt pathways. The m5C methyltransferase NSUN2 was highly expressed in HCC tissues consistently. Interestingly, the expression of many oncogenes was positively correlated with the expression of NSUN2, including GRB2, RNF115, AATF, ADAM15, RTN3, and HDGF. Real-time PCR assays further revealed that the expression of the mRNA of GRB2, RNF115, and AATF decreased significantly with the depletion of NSUN2 in HCC cells.

    "abstract": "Aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, yet we still do not understand how the aging process leads to pathological vulnerability. The research community has relied heavily on mouse models, but the considerable anatomical, physiological, and cognitive differences between mice and humans limit their translational relevance. Ultimately, these barriers necessitate the development of novel aging models. As a non-human primate, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) shares many features in common with humans and yet has a significantly shorter lifespan (10 years) than other primates, making it ideally suited to longitudinal studies of aging. Our objective was to evaluate the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment. To do this, we utilized the Delayed Recognition Span Task (DRST) to characterize age-related changes in working memory capacity in a cohort of sixteen marmosets varying in age from young adult to geriatric. These monkeys performed thousands of trials over periods of time ranging up to 50 percent of their adult lifespan. To our knowledge, this represents the most thorough cognitive profiling of any marmoset aging study conducted to-date. By analyzing individual learning curves, we found that aged animals exhibited delayed onset of learning, slowed learning rate after onset, and decreased asymptotic working memory performance. These findings are not accounted for by age-related impairments in motor speed and motivation. This work firmly establishes the marmoset as a model of age-related cognitive impairment.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the normal aging process is fundamental to identifying therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases for which aging is the biggest risk factor. Historically, the aging field has relied on animal models that differ markedly from humans, constraining translatability. Here, we firmly establish a short-lived non-human primate, the common marmoset, as a key model of age-related cognitive impairment. We demonstrate, through continuous testing over a substantial portion of the adult marmoset lifespan, that aging is associated with both impaired learning and working memory capacity, unaccounted for by age-related changes in motor speed and motivation. Characterizing individual cognitive aging trajectories reveals inherent heterogeneity, which could lead to earlier identification of the onset of impairment, and extended timelines during which therapeutics are effective.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation for both resistance and disease tolerance has been described in a range of species infected with bacterial, viral and fungal pathogens. In Drosophila melanogaster, genetic variation in mortality following systemic Drosophila C Virus (DCV) infection has been shown to be driven by large effect polymorphisms in the viral restriction factor pastrel (pst). However, it is unclear if pst impacts variation in DCV titres (i.e. resistance), or if it also contributes to disease tolerance. We investigated systemic infection across a range of DCV challenge doses spanning nine orders of magnitude, in males and females of ten Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel (DGRP) lines carrying either a susceptible (S) or resistant (R) pst allele. Our results uncover among-line variation in fly survival, viral titers, and disease tolerance measured both as the ability to maintain survival (mortality tolerance) and reproduction (fecundity tolerance). We confirm the role of pst in resistance, as fly lines with the resistant (R) pst allele experienced lower viral titers, and we uncover novel effects of pst on host vigor, as flies carrying the R allele exhibited higher survival and fecundity even in the absence of infection. Finally, we found significant variation in the expression of the JAK-STAT ligand upd3 and the epigenetic regulator of JAK-STAT G9a. While G9a has been previously shown to mediate tolerance of DCV infection, we found no correlation between the expression of either upd3 or G9a on fly tolerance or resistance. Our work highlights the importance of both resistance and tolerance in viral defence.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that infects 30-40% of the worlds population. Infections are typically subclinical but can be severe and, in some cases, life threatening. Central to the virulence of T. gondii is an unusual form of substrate-dependent motility that enables the parasite to invade cells of its host and to disseminate throughout the body. A hetero-oligomeric complex of proteins that functions in motility has been characterized, but how these proteins work together to drive forward motion of the parasite remains controversial. A key piece of information needed to understand the underlying mechanism(s) is the directionality of the forces that a moving parasite exerts on the external environment. The linear motor model of motility, which has dominated the field for the past two decades, predicts continuous anterior-to-posterior force generation along the length of the parasite. We show here using three-dimensional traction force mapping that the predominant forces exerted by a moving parasite are instead periodic and directed in towards the parasite at a fixed circular location within the extracellular matrix. These highly localized forces, which are generated by the parasite pulling on the matrix, create a visible constriction in the parasites plasma membrane. We propose that the ring of inward-directed force corresponds to a circumferential attachment zone between the parasite and the matrix, through which the parasite propels itself to move forward. The combined data suggest a closer connection between the mechanisms underlying parasite motility and host cell invasion than previously recognized. In parasites lacking the major surface adhesin, TgMIC2, neither the inward-directed forces nor the constriction of the parasite membrane are observed. The trajectories of the TgMIC2-deficient parasites are less straight than those of wild-type parasites, suggesting that the annular zone of TgMIC2-mediated attachment to the extracellular matrix normally constrains the directional options available to the parasite as it migrates through its surrounding environment.",

    "abstract": "Cell stiffness and T-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3) expression have been identified as biomarkers of melanoma metastasis in 2D environments. This study aimed to determine how mechanical and biochemical properties of melanoma cells change during cluster formation in 3D environments. Vertical growth phase (VGP) and metastatic (MET) melanoma cells were embedded in 3D collagen matrices of 2 and 4 mg/ml collagen concentrations, representing low and high matrix stiffness. Mitochondrial fluctuation, intracellular stiffness, and TBX3 expression were quantified before and during cluster formation. In isolated cells, mitochondrial fluctuation decreased and intracellular stiffness increased with increase in disease stage from VGP to MET and increased matrix stiffness. TBX3 was highly expressed in soft matrices but diminished in stiff matrices for VGP and MET cells. Cluster formation of VGP cells was excessive in soft matrices but limited in stiff matrices, whereas for MET cells it was limited in soft and stiff matrices. In soft matrices, VGP cells did not change the intracellular properties, whereas MET cells exhibited increased mitochondrial fluctuation and decreased TBX3 expression. In stiff matrices, mitochondrial fluctuation and TBX3 expression increased in VGP and MET, and intracellular stiffness increased in VGP but decreased in MET cells. The findings suggest that soft extracellular environments are more favourable for tumour growth, and high TBX3 levels mediate collective cell migration and tumour growth in the earlier VGP disease stage but play a lesser role in the later metastatic stage of melanoma.\n\nSymbols\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=184 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/495509v4_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1444cf4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@118427eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b56a0aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@144d41f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

A levels-of-mechanism approach that decomposes a higher-level model of cognition and behavior into component mechanisms provides a coherent and richer understanding of the system than any level alone. Toward this end, we decomposed a cognitive model into neuron-like units using a neural flocking approach that parallels recurrent hippocampal activity. Neural flocking coordinates units that collectively form higher-level mental constructs. The decomposed model suggested how brain-scale neural populations coordinate to form assemblies encoding concept and spatial representations, and why so many neurons are needed for robust performance at the cognitive level. This multi-level explanation provides a way to understand how cognition and symbol-like representations are supported by coordinated neural populations (assemblies) formed through learning.",

    "abstract": "Within the primate order, the morphology of the shoulder girdle is immensely variable and has been shown to reflect the functional demands of the upper limb. The observed morphological variation among extant primate taxa consequently has been hypothesized to be driven by selection for different functional demands. Evolutionary analyses of the shoulder girdle often assess this anatomical region, and its traits, individually, therefore implicitly assuming independent evolution of the shoulder girdle. However, the primate shoulder girdle has developmental and functional covariances with the basicranium and pelvic girdle that have been shown to potentially influence its evolution. It is unknown whether these relationships are similar or even present across primate taxa, and how they may affect morphological variation among primates. This study evaluates the strength of covariance and evolutionary potential across four anatomical regions: shoulder girdle, basicranium, pelvis, and distal humerus. Measures of morphological integration and evolutionary potential (conditioned covariance, and evolutionary flexibility) are assessed across eight anthropoid primate taxa. Results demonstrate a consistent pattern of morphological constraint within paired anatomical regions across primates. Differences in evolutionary flexibility are observed among primate genera, with humans having the highest evolutionary potential overall. This pattern does not follow functional differences, but rather a separation between monkeys and apes. Therefore, evolutionary hypotheses of primate shoulder girdle morphological variation that evaluate functional demands alone may not account for the effect of these relationships. Collectively, our findings suggest differences in genetic covariance among anatomical regions may have contributed to the observable morphological variation among taxa.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental goal in plant microbiome research is to determine the relative impacts of host and environmental effects on root microbiota composition, particularly how host genotype impacts bacterial community composition. Most studies characterizing the effect of plant genotype on root microbiota undersample host genetic diversity and grow plants outside of their native ranges, making the associations between host and microbes difficult to interpret. Here we characterized the root microbiota of a large population of switchgrass, a North American native C4 bioenergy crop, in three field locations spanning its native range. Our data, composed of >2000 samples, suggest field location is the primary determinant of microbiome composition; however, substantial heritable variation is widespread across bacterial taxa, especially those in the Sphingomonadaceae family. Despite diverse compositions, we find that relatively few highly prevalent bacterial taxa make up the majority of the switchgrass root microbiota, a large fraction of which is shared across sites. Local genotypes preferentially recruit / filter for local microbes, supporting the idea of affinity between local plants and their microbiota. Using genome-wide association, we identified loci impacting the abundance of >400 microbial strains and found an enrichment of genes involved in immune responses, signaling pathways, and secondary metabolism. We found loci associated with over half of the core microbiota (i.e. microbes in >80% of samples) regardless of field location. Finally, we show a genetic relationship between a basal plant immunity pathway and relative abundances of root microbiota. This study brings us closer to harnessing and manipulating beneficial microbial associations via host genetics.",

    "abstract": "Stomata, cellular valves found on the surface of aerial plant tissues, present a paradigm for studying cell fate and patterning in plants. A highly conserved core set of related basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) regulate aspects of stomatal cell identity in diverse species. We characterized BdFAMA in the temperate grass, Brachypodium distachyon, and found this late-acting TF was necessary and sufficient for specifying stomatal GC fate, and unexpectedly could also induce the recruitment of subsidiary cells in the absence of its paralogue, BdMUTE. The overlap in function is paralleled by an overlap in expression pattern and by unique regulatory relationships between BdMUTE and BdFAMA. To better appreciate the relationships among the Brachypodium stomatal bHLHs, we characterized the diversity of bHLH complexes through in vivo proteomics in developing leaves and found evidence for multiple shared interaction partners. The ability of BdFAMA to compensate for BdMUTE then prompted us to reexamine the roles of these paralogues in Arabidopsis. By testing genetic sufficiency within and across species, we found that, while BdFAMA and AtFAMA can rescue stomatal production in Arabidopsis fama and mute mutants, only AtFAMA can participate in the specification of Brassica-family-specific myrosin idioblasts. Taken together, our findings further our understanding of how the molecular framework of stomatal development has been reprogrammed across the monocot/dicot divide, as well as within the grasses, to produce distinct stomatal forms and patterns, and compel us to refine the current models of stomatal bHLH function and regulatory feedbacks amongst paralogues.",

    "abstract": "Since the publication of Sprengels (1793) observations, it has been considered that flowers with zygomorphic (or bilaterally symmetrical) corollas evolved to restrict the movement of pollinators into the flower by limiting the pollinators direction of approach. However, little empirical support has been accumulated so far, except Culbert and Forrest (2016) who found that zygomorphy reduced variance in pollinators flower entry angle. Our aim was to build on this work and observe whether floral symmetry or orientation had an effect on pollinator entry angle in a laboratory experiment using bumble bees, Bombus ignitus. Using nine different combinations of artificial flowers created from three symmetry types (radial, bilateral and disymmetrical) and three orientation types (upward, horizontal and downward), we tested the effects of these two floral aspects on the consistency of bees entry angle. Our results show that horizontal orientation significantly reduced the variance in entry angle, while symmetry had little effect. We also found no significant interactions between angle and symmetry in their effect on entry angle. Thus, our results suggest that horizontal orientation forces the bees to orient themselves relative to gravity rather than the corolla and stabilizes their flower entry. This stabilizing effect may have been mistaken for the effect of zygomorphic corolla as it is presented horizontally in most species. Consequently, we suggest that the evolution of horizontal orientation preceded that of zygomorphy as indicated by some authors, and that the reason behind the evolution of zygomorphy should be revisited.",

Here we show that serine racemase (SR), an enzyme that catalyzes the racemization of L-serine to D-serine and vice versa, affects neurogenesis in the adult SVZ by controlling de novo fatty acid synthesis. Complete and conditional deletion of SR in nestin precursor cells lead to diminished neurogenesis in the SVZ. Nestin-cre+ mice showed reduced expression of fatty acid synthase and its substrate malonyl CoA, which are involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis. Global lipidomic analyses revealed significant alterations in lipid subclasses in nestin-cre+ mice. Decrease in fatty acid synthesis was mediated by phospho acetyl CoA carboxylase that was AMPK independent. Both L and D serine treatment rescued defects in SVZ neurogenesis, proliferation and levels of malonyl CoA in vitro. Our work shows that SR affects adult neurogenesis in the SVZ via lipid metabolism.",
