    "abstract": "Cellular response to stimulation governs tissue scale processes ranging from growth and development to maintaining tissue health and initiating disease. To determine how cells coordinate their response to such stimuli, it is necessary to simultaneously track and measure the spatiotemporal distribution of their behaviors throughout the tissue. Here, we report on a novel SpatioTemporal Response Analysis IN Situ (STRAINS) tool that uses fluorescent micrographs, cell tracking, and machine learning to measure such behavioral distributions. STRAINS is broadly applicable to any tissue where fluorescence can be used to indicate changes in cell behavior. For illustration, we use STRAINS to simultaneously analyze the mechanotransduction response of 5000 chondrocytes--over 20 million data points--in cartilage during the 50 ms to 4 hours after the tissue was subjected to local mechanical injury, known to initiate osteoarthritis. We find that chondrocytes exhibit a range of mechanobiological responses indicating activation of distinct biochemical pathways with clear spatial patterns related to the induced local strains during impact. These results illustrate the power of this approach.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesThe DepMap genome-wide loss of function CRISPR screens offer new insight into gene dependencies in HPV(-) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cell lines. We aimed to leverage this data to guide preclinical studies by cataloging novel targetable dependencies that are predicted to offer a useful therapeutic window. We also aimed to identify targets potentially representing synthetic lethalities by testing for associations between genetic alterations and gene dependency profile.\n\nMethodsDepMap was queried for gene probability and effect scores in cell lines from 87 tumors, including 63 HPV(-) HNSCCs plus 24 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), which have comparable etiology, tissue or origin, and genetic profile to HNSCC. A probability score of [&ge;] 0.5 was used as the threshold for essentiality. Essential genes were selected for analysis by 4 criteria: (1) presence in [&ge;]10% cell lines, (2) lack of common essential designation by DepMap, (3) lack of predicted dependency in normal cell lineages, and (4) designation as druggable by the Drug-Gene Interaction Database.\n\nResultsThe 143 genes meeting selection criteria had a median gene effect score of 0.56. Selection criteria captured targets of standard therapeutic agents of HNSCC including TYMS (5-FU), tubulin genes (taxanes), EGFR (cetuximab), plus additional known oncogenes like PIK3CA and ERBB3. Functional classification analysis showed enrichment of tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, RNA-binding proteins, and mitochondrial carriers. 90% of the 143 dependencies were not known oncogenes in the OncoKB Database. 10% of targets had inhibitors previously used in a non-HNSCC phase II trial, including 8 that have not yet been tested in cancer. The 13 genes with median gene effect scores greater than of PIK3CA and not well-studied in HNSCC were assigned highest priority, including DHRSX, MBTPS1, TDP2, FARS2, TMX2, RAB35, CFLAR, GPX4, SLC2A1, TP63, PKN2, MAP3K11, and TIPARP. A novel association was found between NOTCH1 mutation and increased TAP1 dependency.\n\nConclusionsThe DepMap CRISPR screens capture well-studied targets in HNSCC as well as numerous genes without known roles in HNSCC or malignancy in general. Several of these targets have well-developed inhibitors that provide resources to guide preclinical studies. Association of some of the dependencies with known molecular subgroups in HNSCC may enhance use of cell line models to guide personalization of therapy.",

    "abstract": "Inducing cancer cell apoptosis through cytotoxic reagents is the main therapeutic strategy for diverse cancer types. However, several antiapoptotic factors impede curative cancer therapy by driving cancer cells to resist cytotoxic agent-induced apoptosis, thus leading to refractoriness and relapse. To define critical antiapoptotic factors that contribute to chemoresistance in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we generated two pairs of parental and apoptosis-resistant cell models through cisplatin (DDP) induction and then performed whole-transcriptome sequencing. We identified the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) histocompatibility leukocyte antigen complex P5 (HCP5) as the chief culprit for chemoresistance. Mechanistically, HCP5 interacts with UTP3 small subunit processome component (UTP3) and prevents UTP3 degradation from E3 ligase tripartite motif containing 29 (TRIM29)-mediated ubiquitination. UTP3 then recruits c-Myc to activate vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) expression. Activated VAMP3 suppresses caspase-dependent apoptosis and eventually leads to chemoresistance. Accordingly, the expression level of the HCP5/UTP3/c-Myc/VAMP3 axis in chemoresistant patients is significantly higher than that in chemosensitive patients. Thus, our study demonstrated that the HCP5/UTP3/c-Myc/VAMP3 axis plays an important role in the inhibition of cancer cell apoptosis and that HCP5 can be a promising chemosensitive target for cancer treatment.",

In this study, data mining on publicly available transcriptomic datasets revealed EPHA2 to be associated both with inflammation and endochondral ossification in osteoarthritis. EPHA2 was further investigated using a computational model of cellular signaling networks in chondrocytes. In silico activation of EPHA2 increased inflammatory mediators and triggered the hypertrophic differentiation of healthy chondrocytes, the phenotypic switch characteristic of endochondral ossification. Inhibition of EPHA2 in cultured chondrocytes isolated from individuals with osteoarthritis reduced inflammation and hypertrophy. Systemic subcutaneous administration of the EPHA2 inhibitor ALW-II-41-27 attenuated joint degeneration in a mouse model, attenuating local inflammation and pathological endochondral ossification. Collectively, we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition of EPHA2 with ALW-II-41-27 is a promising disease-modifying treatment that paves the route for a novel drug discovery pipeline for osteoarthritis.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition and growth are strongly linked, but not much is known about how nutrition leads to growth. To understand the connection between nutrition through the diet, growth, and proliferation, we need to study the phenotypes resulting from the activation and inhibition of central metabolic pathways. One of the most highly conserved metabolic pathways across eukaryotes is the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway, whose primary role is to detect the availability of nutrients and to either induce or halt cellular growth. Here we used the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (D. mel.) and three non-model Drosophila species with different dietary needs, Drosophila guttifera (D. gut.), Drosophila deflecta (D. def.), and Drosophila tripunctata (D. tri.), to study the effects of dietary amino acid availability on fecundity and longevity. In addition, we inhibited the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway, using rapamycin, to test how the inhibition interplays with the nutritional stimuli in these four fruit fly species. We hypothesized that the inhibition of the TOR pathway would reverse the phenotypes observed under conditions of overfeeding. Our results show that female fecundity increased with higher yeast availability in all four species but decreased in response to TOR inhibition. The longevity data were more varied: most species experienced an increase in median lifespan in both genders with an increase in yeast availability, while the lifespan of D. mel. females decreased. When exposed to the TOR inhibitor rapamycin, the life spans of most species decreased, except for D. tri, while we observed a major reduction in fecundity across all species. The obtained data can benefit future studies on the evolution of metabolism by showing the potential of using non-model species to track changes in metabolism. Particularly, our data show the possibility to use relatively closely related Drosophila species to gain insight on the evolution of TOR signaling.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundReactive oxidative stress is a critical player in the amyloid beta (A{beta}) toxicity that contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease (AD). Mitochondrial damage, observed in AD, is one of the main sources of reactive oxygen species. Although A{beta} causes neuronal mitochondria-associated reactive oxidative stress in vitro, this has never been directly observed in the in vivo living brain. Here, we tested whether A{beta} plaques and soluble oligomers induce mitochondrial oxidative stress in surrounding neurons in vivo, and whether the neurotoxic effect can be abrogated using mitochondrial-targeted antioxidants.\n\nMethodsWe expressed a genetically encoded fluorescent ratiometric mitochondria-targeted reporter of oxidative stress in mouse models of the disease, and performed intravital multiphoton microscopy of neuronal mitochondria and A{beta} plaques.\n\nResultsFor the first time, we demonstrated by direct observation exacerbated mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurons after both A{beta} plaque deposition and direct application of soluble oligomeric A{beta} onto the brain, and determined the most likely pathological sequence of events leading to oxidative stress in vivo. Oxidative stress could be inhibited by both blocking calcium influx into mitochondria and treating with the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SS31.\n\nConclusionsConsidering these results, mitochondria-targeted compounds hold promise as neuroprotective drugs for the prevention and/or treatment of AD.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the interplay between sensory input, endogenous neural dynamics, and behavioral output is key toward understanding the principles of neural computation. Hippocampal place cells are an ideal system to investigate this closed-loop interaction, as they are influenced by both self-motion (idiothetic) signals and by external sensory landmarks as an animal navigates its environment1-9. To continuously update a position signal on an internal \"cognitive map\", the hippocampal system integrates self-motion signals over time10,11. In the absence of stable, external landmarks, however, these spatial correlates of neuronal activity can quickly accumulate error and cause the internal representation of position or direction to drift relative to the external environment1,5. We have previously demonstrated that, in addition to their known roles in preventing and/or correcting path-integration error, external landmarks can be used as a putative teaching signal to recalibrate the gain of the path integration system6. However, it remains unclear whether idiothetic cues, such as optic flow, exert sufficient influence on the cognitive map to enable recalibration of path integration, or if instead an unambiguous allocentric frame of reference, anchored by polarizing landmark information, is essential for path integration recalibration. Here, we use principles of control theory12,13 to demonstrate systematic control of place fields by pure optic flow information in freely moving animals by using a neurally closed-loop virtual reality system that adjusts optic flow speed as a function of real-time decoding of the hippocampal spatial map. Using this \"cognitive clamp\", we show that we can not only bring the updating of the map under control of the optic flow cues but we can also elicit recalibration of path integration. This finding demonstrates that the brain continuously rebalances the influence of conflicting idiothetic cues to fine-tune the neural dynamics of path integration, and that this recalibration process does not require a top-down, unambiguous position signal from landmarks.",

    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) affects 2 billion people worldwide and causes 1.5 million deaths every year. There is great need for new TB vaccines that are more efficacious than the currently licensed BCG vaccine, which provides only limited protection. Our goal was to identify potential targets for new TB vaccines by characterizing the immune responses that distinguish individuals with sterilizing protection against TB (TB-resisters), defined by presence of TB-specific immune responses and absence of latent infection, from individuals with latent TB infection (LTBI-participants).\n\nCryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 13 TB-resisters and 10 LTBI-participants were analyzed by high dimensional spectral flow cytometry after overnight M. tuberculosis (Mtb) antigenic stimulation or unstimulated control. Activation of conventional and nonconventional T cells, NK cells, and antigen presenting cells (APC) was compared between the two groups. Compared with LTBI-participants, TB-resisters had significantly higher proportions of conventional and nonconventional T cells expressing granzyme B (GranzB) and PD-1, and of polyfunctional cells in unstimulated and Mtb-stimulated conditions. Conversely LTBI-participants had higher expression of CD25, CD69, CD107a, IL10 and IFN{gamma}. An unbiased cluster analysis revealed higher frequency of recently described CD8+GMM+GranzB+ T cells in unstimulated PBMC from TB-resisters than LTBI-participants. APC activation revealed very few differences between TB-resisters and LTBI-participants. An exploratory analysis of responses in 14 BCG-recipients with minimal exposure to TB showed multiple differences with TB-resisters and LTBI-participants in PBMC activation; lower polyfunctionality of T cells and APC in Mtb-stimulated PBMC; and absence of CD8+GMM+GranzB+ T cells.\n\nWe conclude that combined increased T cell expression of GranzB and checkpoint inhibitors may contribute to immune protection against TB and may be targeted by new vaccines.",

These cells are activated by infections through stimulation of TLRs expressed on their cell surface and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF. However, distal enhancers that regulate TNF gene transcription in human macrophages have not been investigated. This study used an unbiased genomic approach to identify six candidate enhancers in human primary alveolar macrophages within a 131 kb region from the transcription start site (TSS) of the TNF gene, covering 13 genes. Of these candidate enhancers, five showed enhancer activity, with three targeting the TNF gene and two targeting neighboring genes. Deletion of the distal TNF E-16 enhancer led to a 73% reduction in TNF gene transcription in response to poly (I:C) stimulation in the THP-1 human leukemia monocytic cell line. Additionally, deletion of the E-7.1/hHS-8 enhancer resulted in a 41% reduction in TNF mRNA, while deletion of the PE enhancer had a lesser effect, resulting in a 52% reduction in TNF gene transcription. Massively parallel reporter assays (MPRA) indicated that the transcription factor AP-1 and EGR1-binding sites at the distal TNF E-16 enhancer were crucial in mediating enhancer activity. This study shows that both distal and proximal enhancers work together to fully transcribe the TNF gene in human macrophages in response to TLR ligand poly (I:C) stimulation.",

    "abstract": "The salivary glands often become damaged in individuals receiving radiotherapy for head and neck cancer, resulting in xerostomia, or chronic dry mouth. This leads to detrimental effects on their health and quality of life, for which there is no regenerative therapy. Macrophages are the predominant cell type in the salivary glands and are attractive therapeutic targets due to their unrivalled capacity to drive tissue repair and regeneration. Yet, the nature and role of macrophages in salivary gland homeostasis and whether or not they contribute to tissue repair/regeneration following injury is not well understood. Here, we have used single cell RNA-seq, multi-parameter flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to map the heterogeneity of the salivary gland macrophage compartment throughout development and following radiation-induced injury. We show that there are highly dynamic changes in the composition of the salivary gland macrophage compartment with age, in part due to changes in the ontogeny of these cells, determined using a suite of complementary fate mapping systems. A combination of mutant mice and antibody blockade demonstrates that salivary gland macrophages are dependent on CSF1, but not IL-34 or GM-CSF, for their development and maintenance. Finally, using an in vivo model of radiation-induced salivary gland injury combined with a novel Mafb-specific depletion system, we demonstrate an essential role for macrophages. Without macrophages the clearance of cells with DNA damage, and effective tissue repair following such injury, is severely comprised. Our data, therefore, indicate a strong case for exploring the therapeutic potential of manipulating macrophages in order to promote tissue repair and thus minimise salivary gland dysfunction after radiotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Barnacles are typical fouling organisms which strongly adhere to immersed solid substrates by secreting proteinaceous adhesives called cement proteins (CPs). The self-assembly of the cement proteins forms a permanently bounded layer that binds barnacle to foreign surfaces. However, due to the abundance of cysteines in whole-length CP20, it is difficult to determine its natural structure and to properly describe its self-assembly properties. In this study, a putative functional motif of Balanus albicostatus CP20 (BalCP20) is identified and found to present distinctive self-assembly and wet-adhesion characteristics. The atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM) investigations show that wildtype BalCP20-P3 forms grain-like spindles, which further assembly into fractal-like structures looks like ears of wheat. SDS-PAGE, AFM and LSCM show that DTT treatment opens up disulfide bonds between cysteines and disrupts the fractal-like structures (eras of wheat). Additionally, these morphologies are abolished when one of the BalCP20-P3 four cysteines is mutated by alanine. Circular dichroism (CD) results further suggest that the morphological diversity among BalCP20-P3 and its mutations lays on the proportion of -helix. The above results demonstrate that cysteines and disulfide bonds play a crucial role in the self-assembly of BalCP20-P3. This study provides new insights into BalCP20 underwater adhesion, and brings in new inspirations for the development of novel bionic underwater adhesive.",

    "abstract": "Proteins containing DZF (domain associated with zinc fingers) modules play important roles throughout gene expression, from transcription to translation. Derived from nucleotidyltransferases but lacking catalytic residues, DZF domains serve as heterodimerization surfaces between DZF protein pairs. Three DZF proteins are widely expressed in mammalian tissues, ILF2, ILF3, and ZFR, which form mutually exclusive ILF2-ILF3 and ILF2-ZFR heterodimers. Using eCLIP-Seq, we find that ZFR binds across broad intronic regions to regulate the alternative splicing of cassette and mutually exclusive exons. ZFR preferentially binds dsRNA in vitro and is enriched on introns containing conserved dsRNA elements in cells. Many splicing events are similarly altered upon depletion of any of the three DZF proteins; however, we also identify independent and opposing roles for ZFR and ILF3 in alternative splicing regulation. Along with widespread involvement in cassette exon splicing, the DZF proteins control the fidelity and regulation of over a dozen highly validated mutually exclusive splicing events. Our findings indicate that the DZF proteins form a complex regulatory network that leverages dsRNA binding by ILF3 and ZFR to modulate splicing regulation and fidelity.",

    "abstract": "Damage to the genetic material of the cell poses a universal threat to all forms of life. Central to the DNA damage response (DDR) is a phosphorylation signalling cascade that leads to the co-ordination of the cellular response to a DNA break. Identifying the proteins that are phosphorylated is crucial to understanding the mechanisms underlying this DDR. We have used SILAC-based quantitative phosphoproteomics to profile changes in phosphorylation site abundance following a single double strand break (DSB) at a chromosome internal locus and the subtelomeric bloodstream form expression site in Trypanosoma brucei. We report >6500 phosphorylation sites, including a core set of 211 DSB responsive phosphorylation sites. Along with phosphorylation of canonical DNA damage factors, we find that there is a striking distinction between the proteins phosphorylated in response to a chromosome internal DSB and one at the active BES and describe a single phosphorylation event on Replication factor A (RPA) 1 that is required for efficient resection at a bloodstream form expression site.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) have undergone substantial structural remodelling throughout evolution. Compared to their prokaryotic counterparts, mitoribosomes show a substantial loss of ribosomal RNA, whilst acquiring unique protein subunits located on the periphery of the ribosomal subunit structures. We set out to investigate the functional properties of all 14 unique (mitochondrial-specific or supernumerary) human mitoribosomal proteins in the small subunit. Using genome editing with CRISPR-Cas9, we made knockouts for each subunit in HEK293 cells to study the effect on mitoribosome assembly and function in protein synthesis. Unexpectedly, we show that each supernumerary knockout leads to a unique mitoribosome assembly defect with variable impact on mitochondrial protein synthesis. Our data demonstrates that all supernumerary subunits are essential structural components except mS37. Surprisingly, we found the stability of mS37 was reduced in all our supernumerary knockouts of the small and large ribosomal subunits as well as patient-derived lines with mitoribosome assembly defects. We identified that a redox regulated CX9C motif in mS37 was essential for protein stability, suggesting a potential mechanism to regulate mitochondrial protein synthesis. Together, our findings support a modular assembly of the human mitochondrial small ribosomal subunit mediated by essential supernumerary subunits and identify a redox regulatory role involving mS37 in mitochondrial protein synthesis in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Transit-amplifying progenitor populations with phased behavior have long been postulated as essential to epidermal renewal, but not experimentally observed in vivo. Here we identify a population with bi-phasic behavior using CreER genetic cell-marking in mice for long-term lineage tracing and clonal analysis. Nascent, highly expressing Aspm cells undergo an amplification-phase followed by a timed transition into an extinction-phase, with near complete loss of descending cells from skin. Generalized birth-death modeling of Aspm-CreER and a Dlx1-CreER population that behaves like a stem cell demonstrates neutral competition for both populations, but neutral drift only for the stem cells. This work identifies a long-missing class of non-self-renewing epidermal progenitors with bi-phasic behavior that appears time-dependent as the lineage matures, indicative of a transit-amplifying cell. This has broad implications for understanding cell fate decisions and tissue renewal mechanisms.\n\nOne-sentence summaryWe identify a long-missing class of non-self-renewing epidermal progenitors with bi-phasic and maturation-dependent behavior in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Constitutive activation of the ATF4-mediated integrated stress response (ATF4-ISR) is common in cancer and buffers the metabolic challenges imposed by rapid proliferation. However, hyperactivation of the ISR can induce apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that novel pyrazolo-thiazole derivates activate the mitochondrial protease OMA1 which subsequently induces apoptosis in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells. Apoptosis is dependent on the OMA1 mediated cleavage of DELE1 which leads to activation of HRI and induction of the ATF4 ISR. Screening in 406 cancer cell lines identified an inverse correlation between sensitivity to OMA1 activators and expression of the mitochondrial protein FAM210B. Ectopic overexpression of FAM210B specifically blocks OMA1 activation and apoptosis induction by pyrazolo-thiazole activators in DLBCL. OMA1 activators, including the preclinical candidate BTM-3566, selectively killed ABC, GCB, and double-hit DLBCL lines and induced complete tumor regression across a panel of DLBCL patient-derived xenografts.\n\nSignificanceHere we describe a novel class of small molecules that activate the mitochondrial protease OMA1 and induce therapeutic responses in DLBCL preclinical models in vitro and in vivo.

    "abstract": "IntroductionPalliative care demands a special skill from health care providers which begins with the right attitude and adequate knowledge during training. Little is known about knowledge and attitude of physiotherapy undergraduates towards palliative care. Objective of this study was to assess knowledge and attitude of clinical undergraduates of physiotherapy in Nigerian universities towards palliative care.\n\nMethodThis was a cross sectional survey involving 281 (132 females and 149 males) clinical physiotherapy undergraduates from 10 purposively selected universities across Nigeria. Palliative care knowledge was assessed with a structured questionnaire while attitude was assessed using FROMMELT attitude towards care of the dying scale. Both questionnaires were administered online via Google forms. Socio-demographic data of each respondent was also collected. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Level of significance was set at p<0.05.\n\nResultsMajority of respondents were males (53%) aged 21-25 years (87.9%) from Obafemi Awolowo University (40.3%) and had above average knowledge (62%). Almost all, (99.6%) of the respondents displayed favourable attitude. There were significant associations between knowledge and university of respondents (p=0.001), attitude and age of respondents (p=0.003), as well as attitude and geopolitical zone of origin of respondents (p=0.006). There was significant correlation between knowledge and attitude of respondents (r =0.441, p =0.001).\n\nConclusionThere are knowledge gaps, but positive attitudes towards palliative care among clinical physiotherapy undergraduates in Nigeria. This signifies an essential and urgent need for inclusion, reform or improvement in palliative care education in the curriculum of undergraduate physiotherapy training in Nigerian universities.",

    "abstract": "The genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) is currently comprised of seven viruses, four of which have demonstrated prior evidence of zoonotic capacity. These include the biosafety level 4 agents Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, which circulate naturally in pteropodid fruit bats. Here, we describe and characterize Angavokely virus (AngV), a divergent henipavirus identified in urine samples from wild, Madagascar fruit bats. We report the near-complete 16,740 nt genome of AngV, which encodes the six major henipavirus structural proteins (nucleocapsid, phosphoprotein, matrix, fusion, glycoprotein, and L polymerase). Within the phosphoprotein (P) gene, we identify an alternative start codon encoding the AngV C protein and a putative mRNA editing site where the insertion of one or two guanine residues encodes, respectively, additional V and W proteins. In other paramyxovirus systems, C, V, and W are accessory proteins involved in antagonism of host immune responses during infection. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that AngV is ancestral to all four previously described bat henipaviruses--HeV, NiV, Cedar virus (CedV), and Ghanaian bat virus (GhV)--but evolved more recently than rodent- and shrew-derived henipaviruses, Mojiang (MojV), Gamak (GAKV), and Daeryong (DARV) viruses. Predictive structure-based alignments suggest that AngV is unlikely to bind ephrin receptors, which mediate cell entry for all other known bat henipaviruses. Identification of the AngV receptor is needed to clarify the viruss potential host range. The presence of V and W proteins in the AngV genome suggest that the virus could be pathogenic following zoonotic spillover.\n\nImportanceHenipaviruses include highly pathogenic emerging zoonotic viruses, derived from bat, rodent, and shrew reservoirs. Bat-borne Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) are the most well-known henipaviruses, for which no effective antivirals or vaccines for humans have been described. Here we report the discovery and characterization of a novel henipavirus, Angavokely virus (AngV), isolated from wild fruit bats in Madagascar. Genomic characterization of AngV reveals all major features associated with pathogenicity in other henipaviruses, suggesting that AngV could be pathogenic following spillover to human hosts. Our work suggests that AngV is an ancestral bat henipavirus which likely uses viral entry pathways distinct from those previously described for HeV and NiV. In Madagascar, bats are consumed as a source of human food, presenting opportunities for cross-species transmission. Characterization of novel henipaviruses and documentation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potential are essential to predicting and preventing the emergence of future zoonoses that cause pandemics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInterventions based on social cognitive theory are more patient-centered and focused on principles that can enlighten and encourage adoption of healthy habits. Addressing limited stroke literacy among stroke survivors based on social cognitive theory is an effective means to reduce secondary stroke risk. The use of trending Mobile Health (m-health) devices can be a valuable interventional approach to achieve this through improved stroke literacy.\n\nObjectivesThe objectives of this study were to develop and test effectiveness of m-health based educational package for stroke prevention among stroke survivors.\n\nMethodThis was a multimodal methodology involving content development and effectiveness testing using Delphi protocol and pretest-posttest design respectively. Development involved items selection, rating and retention; script writing, translation and recording into an audio and video educational packages. Effectiveness testing involved 30 consenting, consecutively assigned SSVs in each of audio (AIG) and video (VIG) intervention group. Stroke literacy was assessed at baseline, 2nd and 4th week post-intervention. Participants socio-demographic data were also collected. Data was summarized using descriptive and inferential statistics. Alpha value was set at p<0.05.\n\nResultsMajority of the participants were male (63.3%), over 60 years old (51.7%), hypertensive (83.3%) and had tertiary education (31.7%). Knowledge of stroke risk factors improved between AIG and VIG from baseline (11 23{+/-}4 01 and 10.07{+/-}3.24) to 2nd week (17 73{+/-}0.78 and 15.30{+/-}1.78) and 4th week (17.97{+/-}0.18 and 16.77{+/-}1.01) post-intervention respectively. There were significant differences between the two groups (p<0.01).\n\nConclusionMobile-health education based on social cognitive theory effectively improves stroke literacy among SSVs and should be tested among larger samples in the community.",

    "abstract": "Although new advances in neuroscience allow the study of vocal communication in awake animals, substantial progress in the processing of vocalizations has been made from brains of anaesthetized preparations. Thus, understanding how anaesthetics affect neuronal responses is of paramount importance. Here, we used electrophysiological recordings and computational modelling to study how the auditory cortex of bats responds to vocalizations under anaesthesia and in wakefulness. We found that multifunctional neurons that process echolocation and communication sounds were affected by ketamine anaesthesia in a manner that could not be predicted by known anaesthetic effects. In wakefulness, acoustic contexts (preceding echolocation or communication sequences) led to stimulus-specific suppression of lagging sounds, accentuating neuronal responses to sound transitions. However, under anaesthesia, communication contexts (but not echolocation) led to a global suppression of responses to lagging sounds. Such asymmetric effect was dependent on the frequency composition of the contexts and not on their temporal patterns. We constructed a neuron model that could replicate the data obtained in vivo. In the model, anaesthesia modulates spiking activity in a channel-specific manner, decreasing responses of cortical inputs tuned to high-frequency sounds and increasing adaptation in the respective cortical synapses. Combined, our findings obtained in vivo and in silico reveal that ketamine anaesthesia does not reduce uniformly the neurons responsiveness to low and high frequency sounds. This effect depends on combined mechanisms that unbalance cortical inputs and ultimately affect how auditory cortex neurons respond to natural sounds in anaesthetized preparations.",
