    "abstract": "Sensory information is processed by the brain not in a simple feedforward fashion. Rather, bottom-up inputs are combined in pyramidal cells of sensory cortices with top-down information from higher brain areas that arrives through synapses in apical dendrites. The exact functional role of these top-down inputs has remained unknown. A promising abstract model posits that they provide probabilistic priors for bottom-up sensory inputs. We show that this hypothesis is consistent with a large number of experimental about synaptic plasticity in apical dendrites, in particular with the prominent role of NMDA-spikes. We identify conditions under which this synaptic plasticity could approximate the gold standard for self-supervised learning of probabilistic priors: logistic regression. Furthermore, this perspective suggests an additional functional role for the complex structure of the dendritic arborization plays: It enables the neuron to learn substantially more complex landscapes of probabilistic priors.",

    "abstract": "Small angle scattering (SAS) probes the size and shape of particles at low resolution through the analysis of the scattering of X-rays or neutrons passing through a solution of particles. One approach to extracting structural information from SAS data is the indirect Fourier transform (IFT). The IFT approach parameterizes the real space pair distribution function (P(r)) of a particle using a set of basis functions, which simultaneously determines the scattering profile (I(q)) using corresponding reciprocal space basis functions. This article presents an extension of an IFT algorithm proposed by Moore which used a trigonometric series to describe the basis functions, where the real space and reciprocal space basis functions are Fourier mates. An equation is presented relating the Moore coefficients to the intensities of the SAS profile at specific positions as well as a series of new equations that describe the size and shape parameters of a particle from this distinct set of intensity values. An analytical real space regularizer is derived to smooth the P(r) curve and ameliorate systematic deviations caused by series termination, commonly used in IFT methods though not described in Moores original approach, which is particularly susceptible to such effects. The algorithm is provided as a script, denss.fit_data.py, as part of the DENSS software package for SAS, which includes both command line and interactive graphical interfaces. Results of the program using experimental data show that it is as accurate, and often more accurate, than existing tools.",

Examining the relationships between host and microbe fitness proxies at both the phenotypic and genomic levels can illuminate the mechanisms underlying interspecies cooperation and conflict. We examined naturally-occurring genetic variation in 191 strains of the model microbial symbiont, Ensifer meliloti, paired with each of two host Medicago truncatula genotypes in single- or multi-strain experiments to determine how multiple proxies of microbial and host fitness were related to one another and test key predictions about mutualism evolution at the genomic scale, while also addressing the challenge of measuring microbial fitness. We found little evidence for interspecies fitness conflict; loci tended to have concordant effects on both microbe and host fitnesses, even in environments with multiple co-occurring strains. Our results emphasize the importance of quantifying microbial relative fitness for understanding microbiome evolution and thus harnessing microbiomes to improve host fitness. Additionally, we find that mutualistic coevolution between hosts and microbes acts to maintain, rather than erode, genetic diversity, potentially explaining why variation in mutualism traits persists in nature.",

    "abstract": "A goal of modern biology is to develop the genotype-phenotype (G[-&gt;]P) map, a predictive understanding of how genomic information generates trait variation that forms the basis of both natural and managed communities. As microbiome research advances, however, it has become clear that many of these traits are symbiotic extended phenotypes, being governed by genetic variation encoded not only by the hosts own genome, but also by the genomes of myriad cryptic symbionts. Building a reliable G[-&gt;]P map therefore requires accounting for the multitude of interacting genes and even genomes involved in symbiosis. Here we use naturally-occurring genetic variation in 191 strains of the model microbial symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti paired with two genotypes of the host Medicago truncatula in four genome-wide association studies to study the genomic architecture of a key symbiotic extended phenotype - partner quality, or the fitness benefit conferred to a host by a particular symbiont genotype, within and across environmental contexts and host genotypes. We define three novel categories of loci in rhizobium genomes that must be accounted for if we want to build a reliable G[-&gt;]P map of partner quality; namely, 1) loci whose identities depend on the environment, 2) those that depend on the host genotype with which rhizobia interact, and 3) universal loci that are likely important in all or most environments.\n\nIMPORTANCEGiven the rapid rise of research on how microbiomes can be harnessed to improve host health, understanding the contribution of microbial genetic variation to host phenotypic variation is pressing, and will better enable us to predict the evolution of (and select more precisely for) symbiotic extended phenotypes that impact host health. We uncover extensive context-dependency in both the identity and functions of symbiont loci that control host growth, which makes predicting the genes and pathways important for determining symbiotic outcomes under different conditions more challenging. Despite this context-dependency, we also resolve a core set of universal loci that are likely important in all or most environments, and thus, serve as excellent targets both for genetic engineering and future coevolutionary studies of symbiosis.",

Here we identify the adult mouse ISC niche as a complex, multi-layered structure that encompasses distinct mesenchymal and smooth muscle cell populations. Diverse sub-cryptal cells provide redundant supportive factors, with certain BMPi and the most potent Wnt co-factor, RSPO2, restricted to single cell types. Niche functions refine during a critical period of postnatal crypt morphogenesis, in part to oppose dense aggregation of BMP-expressing sub-epithelial myofibroblasts that promote epithelial differentiation. A specialized muscle layer, the muscularis mucosae, first appears during this period and supplements neighboring RSPO and BMPi sources. In vivo ablation of smooth muscle raises BMP activity and potently limits a pre-weaning burst of crypt fission. Thus, distinct and progressively specialized mesenchymal components together create the milieu required to propagate crypts during rapid organ growth and to sustain adult ISCs.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell datasets are routinely collected to investigate changes in cellular state between control cells and corresponding cells in a treatment condition, such as exposure to a drug or infection by a pathogen. To better understand heterogeneity in treatment response, it is desirable to disentangle latent structures and variations uniquely enriched in treated cells from those shared with controls. However, standard computational models of single-cell data are not designed to explicitly separate these variations. Here, we introduce Contrastive Variational Inference (contrastiveVI; https://github.com/suinleelab/contrastiveVI), a framework for analyzing treatment-control scRNA-seq datasets that explicitly disentangles the data into shared and treatment-specific latent variables. Using four treatment-control scRNA-seq dataset pairs, we apply contrastiveVI to perform a broad set of standard analysis tasks, including visualization, clustering, and differential expression testing. In each case, we find that our method consistently achieves results that agree with known biological ground truths, while previously proposed methods often fail to do so. We conclude by generalizing our framework to multimodal measurements and applying it to analyze a single-cell dataset with joint transcriptome and surface protein measurements.",

Here, we use dotplots and dimensionality reduction to systematically define LCR type/copy relationships and create a map of LCR sequence space capable of integrating LCR features and functions. By defining LCR relationships across the proteome, we provide insight into how LCR type and copy number contribute to higher order assemblies, such as the importance of K-rich LCR copy number for assembly of the nucleolar protein RPA43 in vivo and in vitro. With LCR maps, we reveal the underlying structure of LCR sequence space, and relate differential occupancy in this space to the conservation and emergence of higher order assemblies, including the metazoan extracellular matrix and plant cell wall. Together, LCR relationships and maps uncover and identify scaffold-client relationships among E-rich LCR-containing proteins in the nucleolus, and revealed previously undescribed regions of LCR sequence space with signatures of higher order assemblies, including a teleost-specific T/H-rich sequence space. Thus, this unified view of LCRs enables discovery of how LCRs encode higher order assemblies of organisms.",

To this end, we characterized the influence of age, sex and cognitive performance on PVS anatomical characteristics in a large cross-sectional cohort ([~]1400) of healthy subjects between 8 and 90 years of age using multimodal structural MRI data. Our results show age is associated with wider and more numerous MRI-visible PVS over the course of the lifetime with spatially-varying patterns of PVS enlargement trajectories. In particular, regions with low PVS volume fraction in childhood are associated with rapid age-related PVS enlargement (e.g., temporal regions), while regions with high PVS volume fraction in childhood are associated with minimal age-related PVS alterations (e.g., limbic regions). PVS burden was significantly elevated in males compared to females with differing morphological time courses with age. Together, these findings contribute to our understanding of perivascular physiology across the healthy lifespan and provide a normative reference for the spatial distribution of PVS enlargement patterns to which pathological alterations can be compared.",

In the ageing brain, interferon signalling in stem cells also reduces their ability to activate. Whether these functions are linked and at what time interferons start taking on a role in stem cell functioning is unknown. Additionally, the molecular link between interferons and activation in neural stem cells and how this relates to productivity is not well understood. Here we combine single-cell transcriptomics, RiboSeq and animal models of interferon to show that this pathway is important for proper stem cell function at all ages. Interferon orchestrates cell cycle and mTOR activity to post-transcriptionally repress Sox2 and drive the exit from stem cell activation. The interferon response then decreases in the subsequent maturation states. Mathematical simulations indicate that this regulation is beneficial for the young and harmful for the old brain. Our study establishes molecular mechanisms of interferon in stem cells and interferons as genuine regulators of stem cell homeostasis and a potential therapeutic target to repair the ageing brain.",

    "abstract": "The organization of actin filaments into bundles is required for cellular processes such as motility, morphogenesis, and cell division. Filament bundling is controlled by a network of actin binding proteins. Recently, several proteins that comprise this network have been found to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation. How might liquid-like condensates contribute to filament bundling? Here, we show that the processive actin polymerase and bundling protein, VASP, forms liquid-like droplets under physiological conditions. As actin polymerizes within VASP droplets, elongating filaments partition to the edges of the droplet to minimize filament curvature, forming an actin-rich ring within the droplet. The rigidity of this ring is balanced by the droplets surface tension, as predicted by a continuum-scale computational model. However, as actin polymerizes and the ring grows thicker, its rigidity increases and eventually overcomes the surface tension of the droplet, deforming into a linear bundle. The resulting bundles contain long, parallel actin filaments that grow from their tips. Significantly, the fluid nature of the droplets is critical for bundling, as more solid droplets resist deformation, preventing filaments from rearranging to form bundles. Once the parallel arrangement of filaments is created within a VASP droplet, it propagates through the addition of new actin monomers to achieve a length that is many times greater than the initial droplet. This droplet-based mechanism of bundling may be relevant to the assembly of cellular architectures rich in parallel actin filaments, such as filopodia, stress fibers, and focal adhesions.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are widely developed and used as therapeutics to treat cancer, infectious disease, and inflammation. During development, initial leads routinely undergo additional engineering to increase their target affinity. Experimental methods for affinity maturation are expensive, laborious, and time-consuming and rarely allow the efficient exploration of the relevant design space. Deep learning (DL) models are transforming the field of protein engineering and design. While several DL-based protein design methods have shown promise, the antibody design problem is distinct, and specialized models for antibody design are desirable. Inspired by hallucination frameworks that leverage accurate structure prediction DL models, we propose the FvHallucinator for designing antibody sequences, especially the CDR loops, conditioned on an antibody structure. Such a strategy generates targeted CDR libraries that retain the conformation of the binder and thereby the mode of binding to the epitope on the antigen. On a benchmark set of 60 antibodies, FvHallucinator generates sequences resembling natural CDRs and recapitulates perplexity of canonical CDR clusters. Furthermore, the FvHallucinator designs amino acid substitutions at the VH-VL interface that are enriched in human antibody repertoires and therapeutic antibodies. We propose a pipeline that screens FvHallucinator designs to obtain a library enriched in binders for an antigen of interest. We apply this pipeline to the CDR H3 of the Trastuzumab-HER2 complex to generate in silico designs improving upon the binding affinity and interfacial properties of the original antibody. Thus, the FvHallucinator pipeline enables generation of inexpensive, diverse, and targeted antibody libraries enriched in binders for antibody affinity maturation.",

The ecology and evolution of rabies host-pathogen dynamics are influenced by two infection-induced behavioral changes. RABV-infected hosts often exhibit increased aggression which facilitates transmission, and rabies also leads to reduced activity and paralysis prior to death. Although several studies document rabies-induced behavioral changes in rodents and other dead-end hosts, surprisingly few studies have measured these changes in vampire bats, the key natural reservoir throughout Latin America. Here, we take advantage of an experiment designed to test the safety and efficacy of an oral rabies vaccine in captive male vampire bats to quantify for the first time how rabies affects allogrooming and aggressive behaviors in the vampire bat. Compared to non-rabid vampire bats, rabid individuals reduced their allogrooming prior to death, but we did not detect increases in aggression among bats. To put our results in context, we review what is known and what remains unclear about behavioral changes of rabid vampire bats.",

    "abstract": "Neonatal brachial plexus injury (NBPI) causes disabling and incurable muscle contractures that result from impaired longitudinal growth of denervated muscles. This deficit in muscle growth is driven by increased proteasome-mediated protein degradation, suggesting a dysregulation of muscle proteostasis. The myostatin (MSTN) pathway, a prominent muscle-specific regulator of proteostasis, is a putative signaling mechanism by which neonatal denervation could impair longitudinal muscle growth, and thus a potential target to prevent NBPI-induced contractures. Through a mouse model of NBPI, our present study revealed that pharmacologic inhibition of MSTN signaling induces hypertrophy, restores longitudinal growth, and prevents contractures in denervated muscles of female but not male mice, despite inducing hypertrophy of normally innervated muscles in both sexes. Additionally, the MSTN-dependent impairment of longitudinal muscle growth after NBPI in female mice is associated with perturbation of 20S proteasome activity, but not through alterations in canonical MSTN signaling pathways. These findings reveal a sex dimorphism in the regulation of neonatal longitudinal muscle growth and contractures, thereby providing insights into contracture pathophysiology, identifying a potential muscle-specific therapeutic target for contracture prevention, and underscoring the importance of sex as a biological variable in the pathophysiology of neuromuscular disorders.",

Here, we demonstrate that the eIF2 kinase GCN2 is required for sustained growth in androgen-sensitive and castration-resistant models of PCa both in vitro and in vivo, and is active in PCa patient samples. Using RNA-seq transcriptome analysis and a CRISPR-based phenotypic screen, GCN2 was shown to regulate expression of over 60 solute-carrier (SLC) genes, including those involved in amino acid transport and loss of GCN2 function reduces amino acid import and levels. Addition of essential amino acids or expression of 4F2 (SLC3A2) partially restored growth following loss of GCN2, suggesting that GCN2 targeting of SLC transporters is required for amino acid homeostasis needed to sustain tumor growth.

    "abstract": "RNA velocity analysis of single cells promises to predict temporal dynamics from gene expression. Indeed, in many systems, it has been observed that RNA velocity produces a vector field that qualitatively reflects known features of the system. Despite this observation, the limitations of RNA velocity estimates are poorly understood. Using real data and simulations, we dissect the impact of different steps in the RNA velocity workflow on the estimated vector field. We find that the process of mapping RNA velocity estimates into a low-dimensional representation, such as those produced by UMAP, has a large impact on the result. The RNA velocity vector field strongly depends on the k-NN graph of the data. This dependence leads to significant estimator errors when the k-NN graph is not a faithful representation of the true data structure, a feature that cannot be known for most real datasets. Finally, we establish that RNA velocity estimates expression speed neither at the gene nor cellular level. We propose that RNA velocity is best considered a smoothed interpolation of the observed k-NN structure, as opposed to an extrapolation of future cellular states, and that the use of RNA velocity as a validation of latent space embedding structures is circular.",

    "abstract": "Development of the Xenopus pronephros relies on renal precursors grouped at neurula stage into a specific region of dorso-lateral mesoderm called the kidney field. Formation of the kidney field at early neurula stage is dependent on retinoic (RA) signaling acting upstream of renal master transcriptional regulators such as pax8 or lhx1. Although lhx1 might be a direct target of RA-mediated transcriptional activation in the kidney field, how RA controls the emergence of the kidney field remains poorly understood. In order to better understand RA control of renal specification of the kidney field, we have performed a transcriptomic profiling of genes affected by RA disruption in lateral mesoderm explants isolated prior to the emergence of the kidney field and cultured at different time points until early neurula stage. Besides genes directly involved in pronephric development (pax8, lhx1, osr2, mecom), hox (hoxa1, a3, b3, b4, c5 and d1) and the hox co-factor meis3 appear as a prominent group of genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) downstream of RA. Supporting the idea of a role of meis3 in the kidney field, we have observed that meis3 depletion results in a severe inhibition of pax8 expression in the kidney field. Meis3 depletion only marginally affects expression of lhx1 and aldh1a2 suggesting that meis3 principally acts upstream of pax8. Further arguing for a role of meis3 and hox in the control of pax8, expression of a combination of meis3, hoxb4 and pbx1 in animal caps induces pax8 expression, but not that of lhx1. The same combination of TFs is also able to transactivate a previously identified pax8 enhancer, Pax8-CNS1. Mutagenesis of potential PBX-Hox binding motifs present in Pax8-CNS1 further allows to identify two of them that are necessary for transactivation. Finally, we have tested deletions of regulatory sequences in reporter assays with a previously characterized transgene encompassing 36.5 kb of the X. tropicalis pax8 gene that allows expression of a truncated pax8-GFP fusion protein recapitulating endogenous pax8 expression. This transgene includes three conserved pax8 enhancers, Pax8-CNS1, Pax8-CNS2 and Pax8-CNS3. Deletion of Pax8-CNS1 alone does not affect reporter expression, but deletion of a 3.5kb region encompassing Pax8-CNS1 and Pax8-CNS2 results in a severe inhibition of reporter expression both in the otic placode and kidney field domains.",

    "abstract": "Secreted proteins, which include cytokines, hormones and growth factors, are extracellular ligands that control key signaling pathways mediating cell-cell communication within and between tissues and organs. Many drugs target secreted ligands and their cell-surface receptors. Still, there are hundreds of secreted human proteins that either have no identified receptors (\"orphans\") and are likely to act through cell surface receptors that have not yet been characterized. Discovery of secreted ligand-receptor interactions by high-throughput screening has been problematic, because the most commonly used high-throughput methods for protein-protein interaction (PPI) screening do not work well for extracellular interactions. Cell-based screening is a promising technology for definition of new ligand-receptor interactions, because multimerized ligands can enrich for cells expressing low affinity cell-surface receptors, and such methods do not require purification of receptor extracellular domains. Here, we present a proteo-genomic cell-based CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) enrichment screening platform employing customized pooled cell surface receptor sgRNA libraries in combination with a magnetic bead selection-based enrichment workflow for rapid, parallel ligand-receptor deorphanization. We curated 80 potentially high value orphan secreted proteins and ultimately screened 20 secreted ligands against two cell sgRNA libraries with targeted expression of all single-pass (TM1) or multi-pass (TM2+) receptors by CRISPRa. We identified previously unknown interactions in 12 of these screens, and validated several of them using surface plasmon resonance and/or cell binding. The newly deorphanized ligands include three receptor tyrosine phosphatase (RPTP) ligands and a chemokine like protein that binds to killer cell inhibitory receptors (KIRs). These new interactions provide a resource for future investigations of interactions between the human secreted and membrane proteomes.",

    "abstract": "The basal levels of salicylic acid (SA), an important plant hormone, vary dramatically among plant species. In the shoot, for example, the monocot plant rice contains almost 100 times higher SA levels than the dicot model plant Arabidopsis. Despite its high basal levels, neither the biosynthetic pathway nor the biological functions of SA is well understood in rice. Here, we report that the synthesis of basal SA in rice shoot is not altered in the mutant for the ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE (ICS) gene, but drastically reduced in the mutant for OsAIM1, which encodes a beta-oxidation enzyme in the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) pathway. Analogous to its role in thermogenesis, compromised SA accumulation in the Osaim1 mutant led to a lower shoot temperature than wild-type plants. However, this shoot temperature defect was resulted from increased transpiration due to elevated steady-state stomatal aperture in the mutant. Furthermore, the high basal shoot SA level is required for sustained expression of WRKY45 to modulate the steady-state stomatal aperture and shoot temperature in rice. Taken together, these results provide the direct genetic evidence for the critical role of the PAL pathway in the biosynthesis of high levels of basal SA, which play an important role in the regulation of steady-state stomatal aperture to promote fitness under both normal and stress conditions.",

    "abstract": "The view on the role of light during seed germination stems mainly from studies with Arabidopsis, where light is required to initiate this process. In contrast, white light is a strong inhibitor of germination in other plants, exemplified by accessions of Aethionema arabicum, another Brassicaceae. Their seeds respond to light with gene expression changes of key regulators converse to Arabidopsis, resulting in antipodal hormone regulation and prevention of germination. The photoreceptors involved in this process in A. arabicum were unknown. Screening the first mutant collection of A. arabicum, we identified koy-1, a mutant that lost light inhibition of germination, due to a deletion in the promoter of HEME OXYGENASE 1, the gene for a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of the phytochrome chromophore. koy-1 seeds are unresponsive to red- and far-red light and hyposensitive under white light. Comparison of hormone and gene expression between wild type and koy- 1 revealed that very low light fluence stimulates germination, while high irradiance of red and far-red light is inhibitory, indicating a dual role of phytochromes in light-regulated seed germination. The mutation also affects the ratio between the two fruit morphs of A. arabicum, suggesting that light reception via phytochromes can fine-tune several parameters of propagation in adaptation to conditions in the habitat.\n\nOne sentence summaryCharacterization of a phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis mutant demonstrates an active role of phytochromes in the light-inhibited seed germination in Aethionema arabicum.",

    "abstract": "Roots are highly plastic organs enabling plants to acclimate to a changing below-ground environment. In addition to abiotic factors like nutrients or mechanical resistance, plant roots also respond to temperature variation. Below the heat stress threshold, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings react to elevated temperature by promoting primary root growth, possibly to reach deeper soil regions with potentially better water saturation. While above-ground thermomorphogenesis is enabled by thermo-sensitive cell elongation, it was unknown how temperature modulates root growth. We here show that roots are able to sense and respond to elevated temperature independent of shoot-derived signals. A yet unknown root thermosensor seems to employ auxin as a messenger to promote primary root growth. Growth is primarily achieved by accelerating cell division rates in the root apical meristem, likely maintained via temperature-sensitive organization of the polar auxin transport system. Hence, the primary cellular target of elevated ambient temperature differs fundamentally between root and shoot tissues, while the messenger auxin that relays temperature information to elongating or dividing cells, respectively, remains the same.",

    "abstract": "Determining the distribution and environmental preferences of rare species threatened by global change has long been a focus of conservation. Typical minimum suggested number of occurrences ranges from [~]5 to 30, but many species are represented by even fewer occurrences. However, several newer methods may be able to accommodate such low samples sizes. These include Bayesian joint species distribution models (JSDMs) which allow rare species to statistically \"borrow strength\" from more common species with similar niches, and ensembles of small models (ESMs), which reduce the number of parameters by averaging smaller models. Here we explore how niche breadth and niche position relative to other species influence model performance at low sample sizes (N=2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64) using virtual species within a community of real species. ESMs were better at discrimination tasks for most species, and yielded better-than-random accuracy even for N=2. In contrast, \"traditional\" single species or JSDMs were better able to estimate the underlying response curves of variables that influenced the niche, but at low sample sizes also were more likely to incorrectly identify unimportant factors as influential. Species with niches that were narrow and peripheral to the available environmental space yielded models with better discrimination capacity than species with broad niches or niches that were similar to those of other species, regardless of whether the modeling algorithm allowed for borrowing of strength. Our study suggests that some rare species may be able to be modeled reliably at very low sample sizes, although the best algorithm depends on number of occurrences and whether the niche or distribution is the focus.",

    "abstract": "Adaptive phenotypic plasticity may improve the response of individuals when faced with new environmental conditions. Typically, empirical evidence for plasticity is based on phenotypic reaction norms obtained in reciprocal transplant experiments. In such experiments, individuals from their native environment are transplanted into a different environment, and a number of trait values, potentially implicated in individuals response to the new environment, are measured. However, the interpretations of reaction norms may differ depending on the nature of the assessed traits, which may not be known beforehand. For example, for traits that contribute to local adaptation, adaptive plasticity implies non-zero slopes of reaction norms. By contrast, for traits that are correlated to fitness, high tolerance to different environments (possibly due to adaptive plasticity in traits that contribute to adaptation) may, instead, result in flat reaction norms. Here we investigate reaction norms for adaptive versus fitness-correlated traits, and how they may affect the conclusions regarding the contribution of plasticity. To this end, we first simulate range expansion along an environmental gradient where plasticity evolves to different values locally and then perform reciprocal transplant experiments in silico. We show that reaction norms alone cannot inform us whether the assessed trait exhibits locally adaptive, maladaptive, neutral or no plasticity, without any additional knowledge of the traits assessed and species biology. We use the insights from the model to analyse and interpret empirical data from reciprocal transplant experiments involving the marine isopod Idotea balthica sampled from two geographical locations with different salinities, concluding that the low-salinity population likely has reduced adaptive plasticity relative to the high-salinity population. Overall, we conclude that, when interpreting results from reciprocal transplant experiments, it is necessary to consider whether traits assessed are locally adaptive with respect to the environmental variable accounted for in the experiments, or correlated to fitness.",

We have now classified an additional 251 variants for RYR1-related MHS according to current ClinGen standards and updated the criteria where necessary. Criterion PS4 was modified such that individuals with multiple RYR1 variants classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic (LP) or variant of uncertain significance (VUS) were not considered as providing evidence for pathogenicity. Critera PS1 and PM5 were revised to consider LP variants at the same amino acid residue as providing evidence for pathogenicity at reduced strength. Finally, PM1 was revised such that if PS1 or PM5 are used PM1, if applicable, should be downgraded to supporting. Of the 251 RYR1 variants, 42 were classified as P/LP, 16 as B/LB, and 193 as VUS. The primary driver of 176 VUS classifications was insufficient evidence supporting pathogenicity, rather than evidence against pathogenicity. Functional data supporting PS3/BS3 was identified for only 13 variants. Based on the posterior probabilities of pathogenicity and variant frequencies in gnomAD, we estimated the prevalence of individuals with RYR1-related MHS pathogenic variants to be between 1/300 and 1/1,075, considerably higher than current estimates. We have updated ACMG/AMP criteria for RYR1-related MHS and classified 251 variants. We suggest that prioritization of functional studies is needed to resolve the large number of VUS classifications and allow for appropriate risk assessment. RYR1-related MHS pathogenic variants are likely to be more common than currently appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Cross-sectional studies have linked differences in white matter tissue properties to reading skills. However, past studies have reported a range of, sometimes conflicting, results. Some studies suggest that white matter properties act as individual-level traits predictive of reading skill, whereas others suggest that reading skill and white matter develop as a function of an individuals educational experience. In the present study, we tested two hypotheses: a) that diffusion properties of the white matter reflect stable brain characteristics that relate to reading skills over development or b) that white matter is a dynamic system, linked with learning over time. To answer these questions, we examined the relationship between white matter and reading in a five-year longitudinal dataset and a series of large-scale, single-observation, cross-sectional datasets (N=14,249 total participants). We find that gains in reading skill correspond to longitudinal changes in the white matter. However, in the single-observation datasets, we find no evidence for the hypothesis that individual differences in white matter predict reading skill. These findings highlight the link between dynamic processes in the white matter and learning.",

    "abstract": "The ability to flexibly adjust beliefs about other people is crucial for human social functioning. Dopamine has been proposed to regulate the precision of beliefs, but direct behavioural evidence of this is lacking. We investigated how a relatively high dose of the selective D2/D3 dopamine receptor antagonist sulpiride impacts learning about other peoples prosocial attitudes in a repeated trust game. Using a Bayesian model of belief updating, we show that sulpiride increased the volatility of beliefs, which led to higher precision-weights on prediction errors. This effect was entirely driven by participants with genetically conferring higher dopamine availability (Taq1a polymorphism). Higher precision weights were reflected in higher reciprocal behaviour in the repeated trust game but not in single-round trust games. This finding suggests that antipsychotic medication might acutely reduce rigidity of pathological beliefs.",

    "abstract": "Olfactory coding, from insects to humans, is canonically considered to involve considerable across-fiber coding already at the peripheral level, thereby allowing recognition of very large numbers of odor compounds. Here we show that the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria, has evolved an alternative strategy built on highly specific odorant receptors feeding into a complex primary processing center in the brain.\n\nBy collecting odors from food and different life stages of the locust, we identified 208 ecologically relevant odorants, which we used to deorphanize 48 locust olfactory receptors via ectopic expression in Drosophila. Contrary to the often broadly tuned olfactory receptors of other insects, almost all locust receptors were found to be narrowly tuned to one ligand and most of these best ligands exclusively excited only one receptor. Knocking out a single receptor using CRISPR-Cas9 resulted in an abolished physiological and behavioral response to the corresponding ligand. We conclude that the locust olfactory system, with an apparent lack of redundancy among most olfactory receptors, differs from so-far described olfactory systems.",

Lentiviral CER constructs comprised of the extracellular domain of T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain containing 4 (TIM-4), the PS receptor, and engulfment signaling domains were transduced into primary rhesus macaque (RM) T cells. We measured PS binding and T-cell engulfment of RM CD4+ T cells infected with SIV expressing GFP. As chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells induce PS and subsequent TIM-4 binding, we evaluated in vitro killing of CAR and CER T-cell combinations. We found that recombinant TIM-4 bound to SIV infected cells. In vitro, CER CD4+ T cells effectively killed SIV infected cells, which was dependent on TIM-4 binding to PS. Enhanced killing of SIV infected CD4+ T cells by CER and CAR T-cell combinations was observed.

    "abstract": "Bacterial biofilm is crucial in inducing the larval transition from pelagic to benthic environments for marine organisms. Bacteria can therefore dictate species distribution and success of the individual. Despite the importance of marine bacteria to animal ecology, the identity of inductive microbes for many invertebrates are unknown. We isolated bacteria belonging to multiple phyla are capable of inducing settlement and metamorphosis in the upside-down jellyfish Cassiopea xamachana. The most inductive isolates belonged to the genus Pseudoalteromonas, a marine bacterium known to induce the pelago-benthic transition in other marine invertebrates. In sequencing the genome of the isolated Pseudoalteromonas and an inductive Vibrio, we found biosynthetic pathways previously implicated in larval settlement were absent in these Cassiopea inducing taxa. Comparative analysis of the Pseudoalteromonas and Vibrio revealed shared genes that could underlie the inductive capacity of these two bacteria. Thus, C. xamachana are capable of responding to multiple bacterial species, but they may be responding to a common cue produced by multiple taxa. These findings could provide hints to the ecological success of C. xamachana compared to sympatric congeneric species within mangrove environments and provide avenues to investigate the evolution of animal-microbe interactions.",

Proviruses of different subgroups displayed a bias in tissue expression which may be associated with differences in transcription factor binding sites in their LTRs. Provirus expression was greater in evolutionarily older proviruses with an earliest shared ancestor of gorilla or older. HML-2 expression was significantly affected by biological sex in one tissue, while age and timing of death (Hardy score) had little effect.

    "abstract": "The current model for human papillomavirus (HPV) replication is comprised of three modes of replication. Following infectious delivery, the viral genome is amplified during the establishment phase to reach up to some hundred copies per cell. HPV genome copy number remains constant during the maintenance stage. Differentiation of infected cells induces HPV genome amplification. Using highly sensitive in situ hybridization (DNAscope) and freshly HPV16-infected as well as established HPV16-positive cell lines, we observed that viral genome is amplified in each S phase of undifferentiated keratinocytes cultured as monolayers. Nuclear viral genome copy number is reset to pre-S phase levels during mitosis. The majority of viral genome fails to tether to host chromosomes and is lost to the cytosol. Cytosolic viral genome gradually decreases during cell cycle progression. Loss of cytosolic genome is blocked in presence of NH4Cl or other drugs interfering with lysosomal acidification, suggesting the involvement of autophagy in viral genome degradation. These observations were also made with HPV31 cell lines obtained from patient samples. Cytosolic viral genome was not detected in UMSCC47 cells carrying integrated HPV16 DNA. Analyses of organotypic raft cultures derived from keratinocytes harboring episomal HPV16 revealed the presence of cytosolic viral genome as well. We conclude that HPV maintains viral genome copy number by balancing viral genome amplification during S phase with loss of viral genome that is lost to the cytosol during mitosis. It seems plausible that restrictions to viral genome tethering to mitotic chromosomes resets genome copy number in each cell cycle.\n\nIMPORTANCEHPV genome maintenance is currently being thought to be achieved by regulating expression and activity of viral replication factors E1 and E2. In addition, the E8^E2 repressor has been shown to be important for restricting genome copy number by competing with E1 and E2 for binding to the viral origin of replication and by recruitment of repressor complexes. Herein, we demonstrate that HPV viral genome is amplified in each S phase. Nuclear genome copy number is reset during mitosis by a failure of the majority of genomes to tether to mitotic chromosomes. Rather, they accumulate in the cytoplasm of freshly divided cells. Cytosolic viral DNA is quickly degraded in G1 in a lysosome dependent manner contributing to the genome copy reset. Our data imply that the mode of replication during establishment and maintenance is the same and further suggest that restrictions to genome tethering significantly contributes to viral genome maintenance.",

We assessed the gut microbiota and faecal metabolome in a Stelic Animal Model of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).\n\nDesignThis model was subjected to the following treatments: reverse osmosis water, AFO-202, N-163, AFO-202+N-163, and telmisartan. Faecal samples were collected at 6 weeks and 9 weeks of age. The gut microbiome was analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequence acquired by next-generation sequencing and the faecal metabolome using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.\n\nResultsThe gut microbial diversity increased greatly in the AFO-202+N-163 group. Post-intervention, the abundance of Firmicutes decreased, while that of Bacteroides increased and was the highest in the AFO-202+N-163 group. The decrease in the Enterobacteria and other Firmicutes abundance and in the Turicibacter and Bilophila abundance was the highest in the AFO-202 and N-163 groups, respectively. The Lactobacillus abundance increased the most in the AFO-202+N-163 group. The faecal metabolites spermidine and tryptophan, beneficial against inflammation and NASH, respectively, were greatly increased in the N-163 group. Succinic acid, beneficial in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases, increased in the AFO-202 group. Decrease in fructose was the highest in the AFO-202 group. Leucine and phenylalanine decreased, whereas ornithine, which is beneficial against chronic immune-metabolic-inflammatory pathologies, increased in the AFO-202+N-163 group.\n\nConclusionAFO-202 treatment in mice is beneficial against neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative diseases and has prophylactic potential against metabolic conditions.

    "abstract": "Even though replication and transcription of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) has been intensively studied, little is known about immediate early events of the viral life cycle due to the lack of an efficient infection model allowing genetic dissection of viral factors. We employed the recently developed infection model (Bienkowska-Haba et al. PLOS Pathogen 2018) to investigate genome amplification and transcription immediately after infectious delivery of viral genome to nuclei of primary keratinocytes. Using EdU pulse labeling and highly sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization, we observed that the HPV16 genome is replicated and amplified in an E1 and E2 dependent manner. Knockout of E1 resulted in failure of the viral genome to replicate and amplify. In contrast, knockout of the E8^E2 repressor led to increased viral genome copy number confirming previous reports. Genome copy control by E8^E2 was confirmed for differentiation-induced genome amplification. Lack of functional E1 had no effect on transcription from the early promoter, suggesting that viral genome replication is not required for p97 promoter activity. However, infection with an HPV16 mutant virus defective for E2 transcriptional function revealed a requirement of E2 for efficient transcription from the early promoter. In absence of the E8^E2 protein, early transcript levels are unaltered and even decreased when normalized to genome copy number. Surprisingly, lack of functional E8^E2 repressor did not affect E8^E2 transcript levels when normalized to genome copy number. These data suggest that the main function of E8^E2 in the viral life cycle is to control genome copy number.\n\nIMPORTANCEIt is being assumed that HPV utilizes three different modes of replication during its lifecycle: initial amplification during the establishment phase, genome maintenance and differentiation-induced amplification. However, HPV16 initial amplification was never formally proven due to a lack of an infection model. Using our recently established infection model (Bienkowska-Haba et al. PLOS Pathogen 2018), we demonstrate herein that viral genome is indeed amplified in an E1 and E2 dependent manner. Furthermore, we find that the main function of the viral repressor E8^E2 is to control viral genome copy number. We did not find evidence that it regulates its own promoter in a negative feedback loop. Our data also suggest that the E2 transactivator function is required for stimulation of early promoter activity, which has been debated in the literature. Overall, this report confirms the usefulness of the infection model for studying early events of the HPV lifecycle using mutational approaches.",

    "abstract": "After more than 100 years of generating monoculture batch culture growth curves, microbial ecologists and evolutionary biologists still lack a reference method for inferring growth rates. Our work highlights the challenges of estimating the growth rate from growth curve data and shows that inaccurate estimates of growth rates significantly impact the estimated relative fitness, a principal quantity in evolution and ecology. First, we conducted a literature review and found which different types of methods are currently used to estimate growth rates. These methods differ in the meaning of the estimated growth rate parameter. Kinetic models estimate the intrinsic growth rate {micro} whereas statistical methods - both model-based and model-free - estimate the maximum per capita growth rate {micro}max. Using math and simulations, we show the conditions in which {micro}max is not a good estimator of {micro}. Then, we demonstrate that inaccurate absolute estimates of {micro} is not overcome by calculating relative values. Importantly, we find that poor approximations for {micro} sometimes lead to wrongly classifying a beneficial mutant as deleterious. Finally, we re-analyzed four published data-sets using most of the methods found by our literature review. We detected no single best-fitting model across all experiments within a data-set and found that the Gompertz models, which were among the most commonly used, were often among the worst fitting. Our study provides suggestions for how experimenters can improve their growth rate and associated relative fitness estimates and highlights a neglected but fundamental problem for nearly everyone who studies microbial populations in the lab.",

We report the 3.0 [A]-resolution cryo-electron microscopy structure of the central hub of NuA4, which flexibly tethers the HAT and TINTIN modules. The hub contains the large Tra1 subunit and a core that includes Swc4, Arp4, Act1, Eaf1 and the C-terminal region of Epl1. Eaf1 stands out as the primary scaffolding factor that interacts with the Tra1, Sw4 and Epl1 subunits and contributes the conserved HSA helix to the Arp module. Using nucleosome binding assays, we find that the HAT module, which is anchored to the core through Epl1, recognizes H3K4me3 nucleosomes with hyperacetylated H3 tails, while the TINTIN module, anchored to the core via Eaf1, recognizes nucleosomes that have hyperacetylated H2A and H4 tails. Together with the known interaction of Tra1 with site-specific transcription factors, our data suggests a model in which Tra1 recruits NuA4 to specific genomic sites then allowing the flexible HAT and TINTIN modules to select nearby nucleosomes for acetylation.",

    "abstract": "Multiplex proteomics using isobaric labeling tags has emerged as a powerful tool for the simultaneous relative quantification of peptides and proteins across multiple experimental conditions. However, the quantitative accuracy of the approach is largely compromised by ion interference, a phenomenon that causes fold changes to appear compressed. The degree of compression is generally unknown, and the contributing factors are poorly understood. In this study, we thoroughly characterized ion interference at the MS2 level using a defined two-proteome experimental system with known ground-truth. We discovered remarkably poor agreement between the apparent precursor purity in the isolation window and the actual level of observed reporter ion interference in MS2-scans - a discrepancy that we found resolved by considering co-fragmentation of peptide ions hidden within the spectral \"noise\" of the MS1 isolation window. To address this issue, we developed a regression modeling strategy to accurately predict estimates of reporter ion interference in any dataset. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our procedure for improved fold change estimation and unbiased PTM site-to-protein normalization. All computational tools and code required to apply this method to any MS2 TMT dataset are documented and freely available.",

These nodules are of economic interested and considered potential future resources for said metals, but they also host a variety of deep-sea fauna. In a recent study it was estimated that the removal of these nodules would lead to a loss of up to 18% of all taxa in the CCZ. Here, I assess the impact of removing these nodule-dependent taxa on carbon cycling at two sites (B4S03, B6S02) of the Belgian exploration license area in the eastern CCZ. For this purpose, I developed two highly-resolved carbon-based food web models with 72 (B6S02) to 77 (B4S03) food-web compartments consisting of different detritus pools, bacteria, metazoan meiobenthos, macrobenthic isopods, polychaetes and other macrobenthos, megabenthic cnidarians, crustaceans, poriferans, holothurians and other invertebrate megabenthos, and fish. These compartments were connected with 304 (B6S02) to 338 (B4S03) links which were reduced by 5-6% when nodule-dependent faunal compartments were removed. The models estimated the total system throughput T.., i.e., the sum of all carbon flows in the food webs, in intact food webs as 1.24 mmol C m-2 d-1 and 1.20 mmol C m-2 d-1 at B4S03 and B6S02, respectively, whereupon 67.7% (B4S03) to 69.8% (B6S02) of T.. flowed through the microbial loop. A removal of the nodule-dependent fauna did not affect this microbial loop, but reduced the scavenger loop by 54.6% (B6S02) to 84.1% (B4S03). Overall, nodule-dependent fauna is responsible for only a small fraction of total carbon cycling at the eastern CCZ. Therefore, when the effect of prospective deep-seabed mining on carbon cycling is investigated, its impact on benthic prokaryotes and the microbial loop should be addressed specifically.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTungurahua volcano (Ecuador) intermittently emitted ash between 1999 and 2016, enduringly affecting the surrounding rural area and its population, but its health impact remains poorly documented.\n\nObjectivesWe aim at assessing the respiratory health hazard posed by the 16-17 August 2006 most intense eruptive phase of Tungurahua.\n\nMethodsBased on detailed field surveys and grain size analyses, we mapped the spatial distribution of the health-relevant ash size fractions produced by the eruption in the area impacted by ash fallout. We used Scanning Electron Microscopy and Raman Spectroscopy to quantify the mineralogy, composition, surface texture and morphology of a respirable ash sample isolated by aerodynamic separation. The cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory potential of this respirable ash towards lung tissues was assessed in-vitro using A549 alveolar epithelial cells, by Electron Microscopy and biochemical assays (LDH assay, RT-qPCR, multiplex immunoassays).\n\nResultsThe eruption produced a high amount of inhalable and respirable ash (12.0-0.04 kg/m2 of sub-10 {micro}m and 5.3-0.02 kg/m2 of sub-4 {micro}m ash deposited). Their abundance and proportion vary greatly across the deposit within the first 20 km from the volcano. The respirable ash is characteristic of an andesitic magma and no crystalline silica is detected. Morphological features and surface textures are complex and highly variable, with few fibres observed. In-vitro experiments show that respirable volcanic ash are internalized by A549 cells and processed in the endosomal pathway, causing little cell damage, but some changes in cell morphology and membrane texture. The ash trigger a weak pro-inflammatory response.\n\nDiscussionThese data provide the first understanding of the respirable ash hazard near Tungurahua, and the extent to which it varies spatially in a fallout deposit. Given the long exposure duration of the surrounding population, the chronic effects of this inhalable, weakly bio-reactive ash on health could be further investigated.",

    "abstract": "Our knowledge of aquatic fungal communities, their assembly, distributions and ecological roles in marine ecosystems is scarce. Hence, we aimed to investigate fungal metacommunities of coastal habitats in a subarctic zone (northern Baltic Sea, Sweden). Using a novel joint species distribution model and network approach, we quantified the importance of biotic associations contributing to the assembly of mycoplankton, further, detected potential biotic interactions between fungi-algae pairs, respectively. Our long-read metabarcoding approach identified 504 fungal taxa, of which a dominant fraction (44.8 %) was assigned as early-diverging fungi (i.e., Cryptomycota and Chytridiomycota). Alpha diversity of mycoplankton declined and community compositions changed along inlet-bay- offshore transects. The distributions of most fungi were rather influenced by spatial factors than by environmental drivers, and the influence of biotic associations was pronounced when environmental filtering was weak and spatial patterning lessened. We found great number of co-occurrences (138) among the dominant fungal groups, and the forty associations between fungal and algal OTUs suggested potential host-parasite/saprotroph links, supporting a Cryptomycota-based mycoloop pathway. We emphasize that the contribution of biotic associations to mycoplankton assembly are important to consider in future studies as it helps to improve predictions of species distributions in aquatic ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Migration is typically associated with risk and uncertainty at the population level, but little is known about its cost and benefit trade-offs at the species level. Migratory insects often exhibit strong demographic fluctuations due to local bottlenecks and outbreaks. Here, we use genomic data to investigate levels of heterozygosity and long-term population size dynamics in migratory insects, as an alternative to classical local and short-term approaches such as regional field monitoring. We analyze whole-genome sequences from 97 Lepidoptera species and show that migratory species have significantly higher levels of genome-wide heterozygosity, a proxy for effective population size, than non-migratory species. Also, we contribute whole-genome data for one of the most emblematic insect migratory species, the painted lady butterfly (Vanessa cardui), sampled across its worldwide distribution range. This species exhibits one of the highest levels of heterozygosity described in Lepidoptera (2.95% {+/-} 0.15). Coalescent modeling (PSMC) shows historical demographic stability in V. cardui, and high effective population size estimates of 2 to 20 million individuals 10,000 years ago. The study reveals that the high risks associated with migration and local environmental fluctuations do not seem to decrease overall genetic diversity and demographic stability in migratory Lepidoptera. We propose a \"compensatory\" demographic model for migratory r-strategist organisms in which local bottlenecks are counterbalanced by reproductive success elsewhere within their typically large distributional ranges. Our findings highlight that the delimitations of populations are substantially different for sedentary and migratory insects, and that, in the latter, local and even regional field monitoring results may not reflect whole population dynamics. Genomic diversity patterns may elucidate key aspects of an insects migratory nature and population dynamics at large spatiotemporal scales.",

    "abstract": "This paper presents a new method for mapping surface features on bone (e.g. presence and distribution of ochre, surface cuts and scratches, pathologies, etc.). It is an accessible and quantifiable alternative to photogrammetry or three-dimensional scanning. It breaks each bone down into a number of two-dimensional geometric faces that can be utilised in statistical analyses. The number of faces differs depending on the skeletal development of the individual, with children having fewer faces. The recording method allows faces to be grouped by anatomical plane, bone type, side, and region of the body. These selective groupings facilitate flexible categories for hypothesis testing. The technique was developed to enable a detailed recording of ochre staining on human skeletal remains from Khok Phanom Di, Thailand, used in conjunction with a novel recording method to quantify pigment use across the body, and some exemplary results are presented here. While the technique was developed for recording bone surface staining it could also be used to map other variations on bone surfaces, such as in palaeopathological, forensic or taphonomic contexts.",

    "abstract": "Insights into the processes underpinning convergent evolution advance our understanding of the contributions of ancestral, introgressed, and novel genetic variation to phenotypic evolution. Phylogenomic analyses characterizing genome-wide gene tree heterogeneity can provide first clues about the extent of ILS and of introgression and thereby into the potential of these processes or (in their absence) the need to invoke novel mutations to underpin convergent evolution. Here, we were interested in understanding the processes involved in convergent evolution in open-habitat chats (wheatears of the genus Oenanthe and their relatives). To this end, based on whole-genome resequencing data from 50 taxa of 44 species, we established the species tree, characterized gene tree heterogeneity, and investigated the footprints of ILS and introgression within the latter. The species tree corroborates the pattern of abundant convergent evolution, especially in wheatears. The high levels of gene tree heterogeneity in wheatears are explained by ILS alone only for 30% of internal branches. For multiple branches with high gene tree heterogeneity, D-statistics and phylogenetic networks identified footprints of introgression. Finally, long branches without extensive ILS between clades sporting similar phenotypes provide suggestive evidence for a role of novel mutations in the evolution of these phenotypes. Together, our results suggest that convergent evolution in open-habitat chats involved diverse processes and highlight that phenotypic diversification is often complex and best depicted as a network of interacting lineages.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSelf-paced treadmills are increasingly used in clinical and research settings. Using self-paced (SP) treadmills, researchers can simulate overground walking while participants can walk with different but comfortable gait speeds in a controlled environment. Several algorithms have been designed for self-paced treadmills based on data from force plates, motion capture, and even marker-less systems such as 3D depth cameras.\n\nMethodsWe present a non-linear controller that implements a self-paced algorithm integrated with treadmills. This algorithm uses the subjects centre-of-mass (CoM) position and velocity, relative to the front and back end of the treadmill as inputs. The controller continuously adjusts the treadmills belt speed via belt acceleration. The algorithm attempts to prevent the subject reaching the front and back of treadmill via minimal treadmill acceleration.\n\nFindingsThis method has been safely used in previous studies with over 410 subjects in various populations. We simulated the use of the SP algorithm with three different sensitivities (0.2, 1 and 2). The belt speed predicted by algorithm simulation in matched well with the belt speeds of experiments in (Gait Realtime Analysis Interactive Lab (GRAIL) system.\n\nInterpretationThis algorithm is integrated with a VR environment in which the subject can be immersed and even be mechanically perturbed. Additionally, this algorithm can be implemented in other treadmills where CoM position is known. We encourage researchers to use and build upon our well-established SP algorithm toward a more standardized SP algorithm in different gait scenarios across various instrumented treadmills with different populations.",

From this, word embedding vectors were obtained. For words including \"infarction\", we calculated the cophenetic correlation coefficient (CCC) as an internal validity measure and the adjusted rand index (ARI), normalized mutual information (NMI), and adjusted mutual information (AMI) with ICD-10 codes as the external validity measures. This was performed for each combination of metric and hierarchical clustering method.\n\nResultsSeventy-one words included \"infarction\", of which 38 diseases matched the ICD-10 standard with the appearance of 21 unique ICD-10 codes. The CCC was most significant at 0.8690 (metric and method: euclidean and centroid), while the AMI was maximal at 0.4109 (metric and method: cosine and correlation, and average and weighted). The NMI and ARI were maximal at 0.8463 and 0.3593, respectively (metric and method: cosine and complete).\n\nDiscussionThe metric and method that maximized the internal validity measure were different from those that maximized the external validity measures; both produced different results. The Cosine distance should be used when considering ICD-10, and the Euclidean distance when considering the frequency of word occurrence.\n\nConclusionThe distributed representation, when trained by Word2Vec on the \"infarction\" domain from a Japanese academic corpus, provides an objective inter-disease distance used in PCS.",

The mRNAs for EHD2 and Caveolin-1/2, structural components of caveolae, show co-overexpression across breast tumors, predicting shorter survival in basal-like BC. EHD2 shRNA knockdown and CRISPR-Cas9 knockout of EHD2, together with mouse EHD2 rescue, in TNBC cell line models demonstrate a major positive role of EHD2 in promoting tumorigenesis and metastasis. Mechanistically, we link these roles of EHD2 to store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), with EHD2-dependent stabilization of plasma membrane caveolae ensuring high cell surface expression of the SOCE-linked calcium channel Orai1.

Therefore, knowledge of microenvironmental nutrient levels and how cancer cells cope with such nutrition is critical to understand the metabolism underpinning cancer cell biology. Previously, we performed quantitative metabolomics of the interstitial fluid (the local perfusate) of murine pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tumors to comprehensively characterize nutrient availability in the microenvironment of these tumors (Sullivan et al., 2019a). Here, we develop Tumor Interstitial Fluid Medium (TIFM), a cell culture medium that contains nutrient levels representative of the PDAC microenvironment, enabling study of PDAC metabolism under physiological nutrition. We show that PDAC cells cultured in TIFM, compared to standard laboratory models, adopt a cellular state more similar to PDAC cells in tumors. Further, using the TIFM model we identified arginine biosynthesis as a metabolic adaptation PDAC cells engage to cope with microenvironmental arginine starvation driven by myeloid cells in PDAC tumors. Altogether, these data show that nutrient availability in tumors is an important determinant of cancer cell metabolism and behavior, and cell culture models that incorporate physiological nutrient availability have improved fidelity and enable the discovery of novel cancer metabolic phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Advancements in rational drug design over the past decades have consistently produced new cancer therapies, but such treatments are inevitably countered through an adaptive process that fosters therapy resistance. Malignant cells achieve drug resistance through intrinsic and acquired mechanisms, rooted in genetic and non-genetic determinants. In particular, recent work has highlighted the role of intrinsic cellular heterogeneity in the emergence of transient drug-tolerant persister cells that survive drug treatment, as well as non-genetically driven cell plasticity toward stable resistance. However, these models do not account for the role of dose and treatment duration as extrinsic forces in eliciting cancer cell adaptation. Here, we show that these two components together drive the resistance of ovarian cancer cells to targeted therapy along a trajectory of cellular adaptation, that we denote the  resistance continuum. We report that gradual dose exposure and prolonged treatment promote a continuous increase in fitness, and show that this process is mediated by evolving transcriptional, epigenetic and genetic changes that promote multiple cell state transitions. The resistance continuum is underpinned by the assembly of gene expression programs and epigenetically reinforced stress response regulation. Using both in vivo and in vitro models, we found that this process involves widespread reprogramming of cell survival pathways, including interferon response, lineage reprogramming, metabolic rewiring and oxidative stress regulation. Together, the resistance continuum reveals the dynamic nature of cellular adaptation, and carries implications for cancer therapies, as initial exposure to lower doses primes cells over time for increased resistance to higher doses. Beyond cancer, such continuous adaptation exposes a basic aspect of cellular plasticity, which may also be deployed in other biological systems such as development, immune response and host-pathogen interactions.",

    "abstract": "Compartmentalization can serve different purposes such as the protection of biological active substances from the environment, or the creation of a unique combination of biomolecules for diagnostic, therapeutic, or other bioengineering applications. We present a method for direct encapsulation of molecules in biocompatible and semi-permeable microcapsules made from low-molecular weight poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEG-DA 258). Microcapsules are produced using a non-planar PDMS microfluidic chip allowing for one-step production of water-in-PEG-DA 258-in-water double-emulsions, which are polymerized with UV light into a poly-PEG-DA 258 shell. Semi-permeable PEG shells are obtained by adding an inert solvent to the PEG-diacrylate. Due to the favourable hydrophilicity of poly-PEG-DA 258, proteins didnt adsorb to the capsule shell, and we demonstrate the direct encapsulation of enzymes, which can also be dried in the capsules to preserve activity. Finally, we leverage capsule permeability for the implementation of a two-layer communication cascade using compartmentalized DNA strand displacement reactions. This work presents the direct encapsulation of active biomolecules in semi-permeable microcapsules, and we expect our platform to facilitate the development of artificial cells and generating encapsulated diagnostics or therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "The tilt aftereffect (TAE) is observed when adaptation to a tilted contour alters the perceived tilt of a subsequently presented contour. Thus far, the TAE has been treated as a local aftereffect observed only at the location of the adapter. Whether and how TAE spreads to other locations in the visual field has not been systematically studied. Here we sought an answer to this question by measuring TAE magnitudes at locations including but not limited to the adapter location. The adapter was a tilted grating presented at the same peripheral location throughout an experimental session. In a single trial, participants indicated the perceived tilt of a test grating presented after the adapter at one of fifteen locations in the same hemifield as the adapter. We found non-zero TAE magnitudes in all locations tested, showing that the effect spreads across the tested visual hemifield. Next, to establish a link between neuronal activity and the behavioral results, and to predict possible origins of the spread, we built a model based on known characteristics of neuronal responses in the visual cortex. Simulation results showed that the model can successfully capture the pattern of the behavioral results. Furthermore, the pattern of the optimized receptive field sizes suggests that mid-level visual areas, for example V4, could be critically involved in TAE and its spread across the visual field.",

    "abstract": "We must often decide how much effort to exert or withhold to avoid undesirable outcomes or obtain rewards. In depression and anxiety, levels of avoidance can be excessive and reward-seeking may be reduced. Yet outstanding questions remain about the links between motivated action/inhibition and anxiety and depression levels, and whether they differ between men and women. Here we examined the relationship between anxiety and depression scores, and performance on effortful active and inhibitory avoidance (Study 1) and reward seeking (Study 2) in humans. Undergraduates and paid online workers (NAvoid = 545, NReward = 310; NFemale = 368, NMale = 450, MAge = 22.58, RangeAge = 17-62) were assessed on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and performed an instructed online avoidance or reward-seeking task. Participants had to make multiple presses on active trials and withhold presses on inhibitory trials to avoid an unpleasant sound (Study 1) or obtain points towards a monetary reward (Study 2). Overall, men deployed more effort than women in both avoidance and reward-seeking, and anxiety scores were negatively associated with active reward-seeking performance based on sensitivity scores. Gender interacted with anxiety scores and inhibitory avoidance performance, such that women with higher anxiety showed worse avoidance performance. Our results illuminate effects of gender in the relationship between anxiety and depression levels and the motivation to actively and effortfully respond to obtain positive and avoid negative outcomes.\n\nSignificance statementWe must often take or withhold effortful action to avoid unpleasant outcomes or obtain rewards. Depression and anxiety can impact these behaviours effectiveness, but the roles of avoidance in depression and reward-seeking in anxiety are not fully understood. Gender differences in avoidance and reward-seeking have also not been examined. We present a task in which community participants with a range of anxiety and depression levels made or withheld button presses to avoid hearing an unpleasant sound or obtain a reward. Men deployed more effort than women in avoidance, and women with higher anxiety scores had lower avoidance performance than men. We illuminate gender differences in how depressive and anxiety scores impact our ability to avoid threats and obtain rewards.",

    "abstract": "The medial preoptic area (mPOA) undergoes through neuroanatomical changes across the postpartum period, during which its neurons play a critical role in the regulation of maternal behavior. In addition, this area is also crucial for sleep-wake regulation. We have previously shown that hypocretins (HCRT) within the mPOA facilitate active maternal behaviors in postpartum rats, while the blockade of endogenous HCRT in this area promotes nursing and sleep. To explore the mechanisms behind these HCRT actions, we aimed to evaluate the effects of juxta-cellular HCRT-1 administration on mPOA neurons in urethane-anesthetized postpartum and virgin female rats. We recorded mPOA single units and the electroencephalogram (EEG) and applied HCRT-1 juxta-cellular by pressure pulses. Our main results show that the electrophysiological characteristics of the mPOA neurons and their relationship with the EEG of postpartum rats did not differ from virgin rats. Additionally, neurons that respond to HCRT-1 had a slower firing rate than those that did not. In addition, administration of HCRT increased the activity in one group of neurons while decreasing it in another, both in postpartum and virgin rats. The mechanisms by which HCRT modulate functions controlled by the mPOA involve different cell populations.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance is rapidly spreading by horizontal transfer of resistance genes in mobile genetic elements. While plasmids are key drivers of this process, very few integrative phages encode antibiotic resistance genes. Here, we find that phage-plasmids, elements that are both phages and plasmids, often carry antibiotic resistance genes. We found 60 phage-plasmids with 184 antibiotic resistance genes, including broad-spectrum-cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones and colistin. These genes are in a few hotspots, seem to have been co-translocated with transposable elements, and are often in class I integrons, which had not been previously found in phages. We tried to induce six phage-plasmids with resistance genes (including four with resistance integrons) and succeeded in five cases. Other phage-plasmids and integrative prophages were co-induced in these experiments. As a proof of principle, we focused on a P1-like element encoding an extended spectrum {beta}-lactamase, blaCTX-M-55. After induction, we confirmed that its capable to infect and convert four other E. coli strains. Its re-induction led to further conversion of a sensitive strain, confirming its a fully functional phage. This study shows that phage-plasmids carry a large diversity of clinically relevant antibiotic resistance genes that they transfer across bacteria. As plasmids, these elements seem very plastic and capable of acquiring genes from other plasmids. As phages, they may provide novel paths of transfer for resistance genes, because they can infect bacteria distant in time and space from the original host. As a matter of alarm, they may also eventually mediate transfer to other types of phages.\n\nImportanceDissemination of antimicrobial resistances is a major threat to global health. Here, we show that a group of temperate bacterial viruses (=phages), termed phage-plasmids, commonly encode different and multiple types of resistance genes of high clinical importance, often in integrons. This is unexpected since phages typically do not carry resistance genes and, hence, do not confer their hosts with resistance upon infection and genome integration. Our experiments with phage-plasmids isolated from clinical settings confirmed they infect sensitive strains, rendering them antibiotic resistant. The spread of antibiotic resistance genes by phage-plasmids is worrisome because it dispenses cell-to-cell contact, necessary for the canonical plasmid transfer (=conjugation). Furthermore, their integrons are now genetic platforms for the acquisition of novel resistance genes.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic Leptospira, the causative agents of leptospirosis, comprise >200 serotypes (called serovars). Most have a restricted reservoir-host range, and some, e.g., serovar Copenhageni, are cosmopolitan and of public health importance owing to their propensity to produce severe, fatal disease in humans. Available serotyping approaches--such as multi-locus sequence typing, core genome sequence typing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the cross-agglutination absorption test--are tedious and expensive, and require isolation of the organisms in culture media--a protracted and incredibly inefficient process-- precluding their use in prospective studies or outbreak investigations. The unavailability of culture-independent assays capable of distinguishing Leptospira serotypes remains a crucial gap in the field. Here, we have developed a simple yet specific real-time qPCR assay--targeting a Leptospira-unique gene encoding a putative polysaccharide flippase--that provides intra-species, serotype-defining (i.e., epidemiologically useful) information, and improves upon the sensitivity of preferred lipL32-based qPCR-based diagnostic tests. The assay, dubbed RAgI (\"rage one\"), is rapid and affordable, and reliably and specifically detects group I pathogenic Leptospira in culture, serum and urine, with no detectable off-target amplification--even of the genetically related but low virulence group II pathogenic (formerly \"intermediate\") or non-pathogenic Leptospira. It retained 100% diagnostic specificity when tested against difficult sample types, including field-collected dog urine-samples and environmental samples containing varied and complex microbial species-consortia. And holds considerable promise in the clinical setting, and for routine epidemiological and environmental surveillance studies.",

    "abstract": "Mutagenic drugs are promising candidates for the treatment of various RNA virus infections. Increasing the mutation rate of the virus leads to rapid accumulation of deleterious mutation load, which is proposed to ultimately result in extinction as described by the theoretical concepts of mutational meltdown and lethal mutagenesis. However, the conditions and potential mechanisms of viral escape from the effects of mutagenic drugs have not been conceptually explored. Here we apply a computational approach to quantify the population dynamics and genetics of a population under high mutation rates and discuss the likelihood of adaptation to a mutagenic drug by means of three proposed mechanisms: (1) a proportion of \"traditional\" beneficial mutations that increase growth/fitness, (2) a mutation rate modifier (i.e., evolution of resistance to the mutagenic drug) that reduces the mutation rate, and (3) a modifier of the distribution of fitness effects, which either decreases or increases deleterious effects of mutations (i.e., evolution of tolerance to the mutagenic drug). We track the population dynamics and genetics of evolving populations and find that successful adaptations have to appear early to override the increasing mutational load and rescue the population from its imminent extinction. We highlight that the observed stochasticity of adaptation, especially by means of modifiers of the distribution of fitness effects, is difficult to capture in experimental trials, which may leave potential dangers of the use of mutagenic treatments unexposed.",

    "abstract": "Advanced prostate cancers comprise distinct phenotypes, but tumor classification remains clinically challenging. Here, we harnessed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to study tumor phenotypes by ascertaining nucleosome positioning patterns associated with transcription regulation. We sequenced plasma ctDNA whole genomes from patient-derived xenografts representing a spectrum of androgen receptor active (ARPC) and neuroendocrine (NEPC) prostate cancers. Nucleosome patterns associated with transcriptional activity were reflected in ctDNA at regions of genes, promoters, histone modifications, transcription factor binding, and accessible chromatin. We identified the activity of key phenotype-defining transcriptional regulators from ctDNA, including AR, ASCL1, HOXB13, HNF4G, and NR3C1. Using these features, we designed a prediction model which distinguished NEPC from ARPC in patient plasma samples across three clinical cohorts with 97-100% sensitivity and 85-100% specificity. While phenotype classification is typically assessed by immunohistochemistry or transcriptome profiling, we demonstrate that ctDNA provides comparable results with numerous diagnostic advantages for precision oncology.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEThis study provides key insights into the dynamics of nucleosome positioning and gene regulation associated with cancer phenotypes that can be ascertained from ctDNA.

We detect phenotypic and transcriptomic evidence of differential neuronal vulnerability independent of -synuclein or tau expression levels. Comparing vulnerable with resilient neurons enabled us to identify molecular signatures associated with these differential responses. We used these to verify, and then predict resilient and vulnerable neuron subtypes in human brains. This confirms substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons to be sensitive to -synuclein, and we predict pathogenic tau vulnerable and protected cortical neuron subtypes.

    "abstract": "Lysosomes function as a primary site for catabolism and cellular signaling. These organelles digest a variety of substrates received through endocytosis, secretion and autophagy with the help of resident acid hydrolases. Lysosomal enzymes are folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked to lysosomes via Golgi and endocytic route. The inability of hydrolase trafficking due to mutations or mutations in its receptor or cofactor leads to cargo accumulation (storage) in lysosomes, resulting in lysosome storage disorder (LSD). In Gauchers disease (GD), the lysosomes accumulate glucosylceramide due to a lack of {beta}-glucocerebrosidase ({beta}-GC) activity that causes lysosome enlargement/dysfunction. We hypothesize that improving the trafficking of mutant {beta}-GC to lysosomes may delay the progression of GD. RNAi screen using high throughput based lysosomal enzyme activity assay followed by reporter trafficking assay utilizing {beta}-GC-mCherry lead to the identification of nine potential phosphatases. Depletion of these phosphatases in HeLa cells enhanced the {beta}-GC activity by increasing the folding and trafficking of Gauchers mutants to the lysosomes. Consistently, the lysosomes in primary fibroblasts from GD patients restored their function upon the knockdown of these phosphatases. Thus, these studies provide evidence that altering phosphatome activity possibly delays the GD and forms an alternative therapeutic strategy for this genetic disease.\n\nKey pointsO_LIPhosphatome RNAi screen identified both activators and inhibitors of cellular glucocerebrosidase activity\nC_LIO_LIDepletion of selective phosphatases in HeLa cells improved the folding and trafficking of mutant {beta}-glucocerebrosidase to lysosomes\nC_LIO_LIKnockdown of selective phosphatases restored the low basal {beta}-glucocerebrosidase activity to that of wild-type in primary cells derived from Gauchers disease patients\nC_LIO_LIDepletion of selective phosphatases displayed variable {beta}-GC activity in neuropathic and non-neuropathic Gauchers disease patient cells\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "DNA replication is a vulnerable time for genome stability maintenance. Intrinsic stressors, as well as oncogenic stress, can challenge replication by fostering conflicts with transcription and stabilizing DNA:RNA hybrids. RAD18 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for PCNA that is involved in coordinating DNA damage tolerance pathways to preserve genome stability during replication. In this study, we show that RAD18 deficient cells have higher levels of transcription-replication conflicts and accumulate DNA:RNA hybrids that induce DNA double strand breaks and replication stress. We find that these effects are driven in part by failure to recruit the Fanconi Anemia protein FANCD2 at difficult to replicate and R-loop prone genomic sites. While RAD18 is important for FANCD2 localization after splicing inhibition or aphidicolin treatment, it is comparatively less important during interstrand crosslink repair. Thus, we highlight a RAD18 dependent pathway promoting FANCD2-mediated suppression of R-loops and transcription-replication conflicts.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYGenome instability, a state in which cells acquire mutations more quickly, drives cancer initiation and progression. DNA is normally protected from such mutations by a host of specialized factors that recognize and repair potentially damaging circumstances. Here we describe under-appreciated links between a protein called RAD18, which recognizes potentially damaging stress, and a phenomenon called a transcription-replication conflict. If not repaired such conflicts can lead to DNA breaks. We find that RAD18 plays an important role in recruiting another repair protein called FANCD2 to sites of transcription-replication conflicts. By doing so, RAD18 protects the human genome from damage when it is faced with stresses such as those seen in cancer cells. This work provides new insight to how the FANCD2 protein is brought to potentially damaging sites in our genomes.",

    "abstract": "Muscle weakness and atrophy are clinical hallmarks of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1). Muscle stem cells, which contribute to skeletal muscle growth and repair, are also affected in this disease. However, the molecular mechanisms leading to this defective activity and the impact on the disease severity are still elusive. Here, we explored through an unbiased approach the molecular signature leading to myogenic cell defects in DM1. Single cell RNAseq data revealed the presence of a specific subset of DM1 myogenic cells expressing a senescence signature, characterized by the high expression of genes related to senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). This profile was confirmed using different senescence markers in vitro and in situ. Accumulation of intranuclear RNA foci in senescent cells, suggest that RNA-mediated toxicity contribute to senescence induction. High expression of IL-6, a prominent SASP cytokine, in the serum of DM1 patients was identified as a biomarker correlating with muscle weakness and functional capacity limitations. Drug screening revealed that the BCL-XL inhibitor (A1155463), a senolytic drug, can specifically target senescent DM1 myoblasts to induce their apoptosis and reduce their SASP. Removal of senescent cells re-established the myogenic function of the non-senescent DM1 myoblasts, which displayed improved proliferation and differentiation capacity in vitro; and enhanced engraftment following transplantation in vivo. Altogether this study presents a well-defined senescent molecular signature in DM1 untangling part of the pathological mechanisms observed in the disease; additionally, we demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting these defective cells with senolytics to restore myogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Microtubules are dynamic cytoskeletal polymers, and their organization and stability are tightly regulated by numerous cellular factors. While regulatory proteins controlling formation of interphase microtubule arrays and mitotic spindles have been extensively studied, the biochemical mechanisms responsible for generating stable microtubule cores of centrioles and cilia are poorly understood. Here, we used in vitro reconstitution assays to investigate microtubule-stabilizing properties of CSPP1, a centrosome and cilia-associated protein mutated in the neurodevelopmental ciliopathy Joubert syndrome. We found that CSPP1 preferentially binds to polymerizing microtubule ends that grow slowly or undergo growth perturbations and, in this way, resembles microtubule-stabilizing compounds such as taxanes. Fluorescence microscopy and cryo-electron tomography showed that CSPP1 is deposited in the microtubule lumen and inhibits microtubule growth and shortening through two separate domains. CSPP1 also specifically recognizes and stabilizes damaged microtubule lattices. These data help to explain how CSPP1 regulates elongation and stability of ciliary axonemes and other microtubule-based structures.",

    "abstract": "Sigma 1 Receptor (S1R) is a therapeutic target for a wide spectrum of pathological conditions ranging from neurodegenerative diseases to cancer and COVID-19. S1R is ubiquitously expressed throughout the visceral organs, nervous, immune and cardiovascular systems. It is proposed to function as a ligand-dependent molecular chaperone that modulates multiple intracellular signaling pathways. The purpose of this study was to define the S1R interactome under native conditions and upon binding to well-characterized ligands. This was accomplished by fusing the biotin ligase, Apex2, to the C terminus of S1R. Cells stably expressing S1R-Apex or a GFP-Apex control were used to map specific protein interactions. Biotinylated proteins were labeled under native conditions and in a ligand dependent manner, then purified and identified using quantitative mass spectrometry. Under native conditions, S1R biotinylates over 200 novel proteins, many of which localize within the endomembrane system (ER, Golgi, secretory vesicles) and function within the secretory pathway. Under conditions of cellular exposure to either S1R agonist or antagonist, results show enrichment of proteins integral to secretion, extracellular matrix formation, and cholesterol biosynthesis. Notably, Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin/Kexin Type 9 (PCSK9) displays increased binding to S1R under conditions of treatment with Haloperidol, a well-known S1R antagonist; whereas Low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) binds more efficiently to S1R upon treatment with (+)-Pentazocine ((+)-PTZ), a classical S1R agonist. Our results are consistent with the postulated role of S1R as an intracellular chaperone and further suggest important and novel functionalities related to cholesterol metabolism and biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Fasting exerts various physiological effects, most notably, reduced signaling through the insulin receptor. We showed that insulin receptor activity requires association with Dystrophin Glycoprotein Complex (DGC). Here, we demonstrate that insulin receptor turnover by lysosomes during fasting is dependent on deglycosylation of the principal DGC component, {beta}-dystroglycan. We show that the lysosomal enzymes HexA and Man2b1, which specifically remove N-linked glycans, promote {beta}-dystroglycan deglycosylation and consequently insulin receptor-DGC loss. Surprisingly, the lysosomal enzyme NAGLU, which cannot process N-linked glycosylation, also facilitated {beta}-dystroglycan deglycosylation and insulin receptor loss. NAGLU enhances the activity of the transcriptional complex PPAR-{gamma}/RXR-, which in turn promotes Man2b1 and HexA induction and the resulting {beta}-dystroglycan deglycosylation. Accordingly, downregulation of HexA, Man2b1, NAGLU or RXR- during fasting blocked {beta}-dystroglycan deglycosylation, and caused accumulation of insulin receptor-DGC assemblies on the membrane. Thus, NAGLU mediates physiological adaptation to fasting by promoting {beta}-dystroglycan deglycosylation.",

    "abstract": "Eyesight plays essential roles for the survival of most animal species, and diseases leading to blindness or partial vision loss in humans have an enormous impact in life quality. The complex structure of the eye makes it ideal for the study of structure-function relationships, and to accomplish integration of histology with other disciplines, connecting basic anatomical sciences to clinical medicine. The RGB trichrome consists of the sequential staining with three dyes, fast green (as a general protein stain), picrosirius red and alcian blue (for two main components of the extracellular matrix, collagen and glycosaminoglycans respectively). Notably, this combination of primary colors matches the physiological color detection capacity of the human trichromatic eye. Application of RGB stain to human eye samples and to the eye of two widely used animal models, the mouse and the zebrafish (Danio rerio), gives rise to brilliant staining of eye connective tissues, with a range of colors from red to magenta depending on the extracellular matrix composition, and producing highly contrasted tissue interfaces, facilitating the observation of tissue structures, as well as histomorphometric analysis. Interestingly, staining of the retina resulted in differential staining of the retinal layers in the three species analyzed. These results support the effectiveness of RGB as a reliable general staining method, complementary to routine basic hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), applicable to the study of the eye in human pathology, basic preclinical research, as well as in histo(patho)logy teaching.",

    "abstract": "Designing movesets providing high quality protein conformations remains a hard problem, especially when it comes to deform a long protein backbone segment, and a key building block to do so is the so-called tripeptide loop closure (TLC). Consider a tripeptide whose first and last segments (N1C;1 and C;3C3) are fixed, and so are all internal coordinates except the six {({phi},{psi} )}i=1,2,3 dihedral angles associated to the three C carbons. Under these conditions, the TLC algorithm provides all possible values for these six dihedral angles-there exists at most 16 solutions. TLC moves atoms up to ~ 5[A] in one step and retains low energy conformations, whence its pivotal role to design move sets sampling protein loop conformations.\n\nIn this work, we relax the previous constraints, allowing the last segment (C;3C3) to freely move in 3D space-or equivalently in a 5D configuration space. We exhibit necessary geometric constraints in this 5D space for TLC to admit solutions. Our analysis provides key insights on the geometry of solutions for TLC. Most importantly, when using TLC to sample loop conformations based on m consecutive tripeptides along a protein backbone, we obtain an exponential gain in the volume of the 5m-dimensional configuration space to be explored.",

    "abstract": "PIEZO1 channels open in response to numerous mechanical stimuli, such as physical membrane deformations, which modulate the curvature of flexible domains called blades. Yet, whether different stimuli cause similar blade motions and whether these rearrangements correlate with pore opening remain unclear. Here, we scan local conformational changes along the PIEZO1 blade using fluorescent probes. We identify two distant probes, one intracellular proximal and the other extracellular distal, which independently and robustly respond to flow stimuli. Flow-induced signals from both probes exquisitely correlate with PIEZO1-dependent calcium influx and specifically increase in presence of fast-inactivating pore mutations. In contrast, both probes remain fluorimetrically silent to hypotonic shocks and indentations, two stimuli that otherwise evoke normal electrochemical responses in both engineered channels. This study reveals that flow-induced blade motions are functionally coupled to the pore and that at least two distant blade regions discriminate flow from two other stimuli, suggesting that PIEZO1 mobilizes distinct mechanisms to sense a broad range of mechanical cues.\n\nTeaserFluorimetric evidence suggests that different mechanical stimuli impart distinct rearrangements in PIEZO1s mechanosensory domains.",

The distribution of Piezo1 within a cell is essential for various biological processes including cytokinesis, cell migration, and wound healing. However, the underlying principles that guide the subcellular distribution of Piezo1 remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that membrane curvature serves as a key regulator of the spatial distribution of Piezo1 in the plasma membrane of living cells. Piezo1 depletes from highly curved membrane protrusions such as filopodia and enriches to nanoscale membrane invaginations. Quantification of the curvaturedependent sorting of Piezo1 directly reveals the in situ nano-geometry of the Piezo1-membrane complex. Piezo1 density on filopodia increases upon activation, independent of Ca2+, suggesting flattening of the channel upon opening. Consequently, the expression of Piezo1 inhibits filopodia formation, an effect that diminishes with channel activation.",

    "abstract": "In the vertebrate retina, phosphorylation of photoactivated visual pigments in rods and cones by G protein-coupled receptor kinases is essential for sustained visual function. In vitro analysis demonstrates that GRK1 and GRK7 are phosphorylated by PKA and that phosphorylation is associated with a decreased capacity to phosphorylate rhodopsin, while in vivo observations show that GRK phosphorylation is cAMP-dependent. In many vertebrates, including humans, GRK1 is expressed in both rods and cones while GRK7 is expressed only in cones. However, mice express only GRK1 in both rods and cones and lack GRK7. We recently reported that a mutation deleting the phosphorylation site, Ser21, in GRK1 is associated with a delay in dark adaptation in mouse rods but not in cones, suggesting that GRK1 may serve a different role depending upon the photoreceptor cell type in which it is expressed. Here, we present immunochemical and electrophysiological studies using zebrafish as a model. Since zebrafish display a retinal GRK expression profile similar to humans, these studies will allow us to further evaluate the role of cAMP-dependent GRK phosphorylation in cone photoreceptor recovery that may be relevant to human physiology. ERG analyses of wildtype and Grk-knockout zebrafish larvae treated with forskolin show that elevated intracellular cAMP significantly decreases recovery of the cone photoresponse, which is mediated by Grk7a rather than Grk1b. Using a cone-specific dominant negative PKA transgenic zebrafish, we show for the first time that PKA is required for Grk7a phosphorylation in vivo. Lastly, immunoblot analyses in rod grk1a and cone grk1b knockout zebrafish, as well as the  all cone Nrl-/- mouse, show that cone-expressed Grk1 does not undergo cAMP-dependent phosphorylation in vivo. These results provide a better understanding of the function of Grk phosphorylation in the context of cone adaptation and recovery.",

The DNA sensor cyclic-GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has emerged as a new principle detecting genome damage, as it can be triggered by aberrant self-DNA. Stimulator of interferon genes (STING)-activation downstream of cGAS can drive cells into senescence or cell death and induces antiproliferative type I interferon (IFN) and pro-apoptotic tumor necrosis factor responses. Herein, we investigated how DNA damage-driven activation of cGAS/STING signaling impacts on hematopoiesis. Defective ribonucleotide excision repair (RER) in the hematopoietic system caused chromosomal instability as well as robust activation of the cGAS/STING/IFN axis, and compromised hematopoietic stem cell function, resulting in cytopenia and ultimately leukemia. Whereas loss of p53 largely rescued RER-deficient hematopoiesis at the cost of further accelerated leukemogenesis, the additional inactivation of cGAS, STING or type I IFN signaling had no detectable effect on blood cell generation and leukemia development. Moreover, cGAS-deficient hematopoiesis showed unaltered responses to spontaneous or acute DNA damage. Our data demonstrate that the cGAS/STING pathway is dispensable for the hematopoietic system coping with chronic or acute DNA damage and does not protect against leukemic transformation in the absence of RER.",

    "abstract": "Although immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has provided robust results in many cancer types such as melanoma and lung cancer, a large percentage of patients remain unresponsive to this therapy. Emerging evidence strongly suggests that one of the contributing factors in ICI resistance is monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) that accumulate in late-stage cancer patients. These M-MDSCs are a subset of innate immune cells and possess potent immunosuppressive activity against T lymphocytes. Here we provide evidence of a mechanism by which CD73-expressing M-MDSCs in the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibit superior T cell suppressor function via adenosine. We show that tumor-derived PGE2, a prostaglandin frequently found at high levels in the TME, directly induces CD73 expression in M-MDSCs by initiating a signaling pathway that is mediated by both Stat3 and CREB. The resulting CD73 overexpression induces elevated levels of adenosine, a nucleoside with strong T cell suppressive activity, culminating in the suppression of CD8+ T cell-mediated anti-tumor responses. We also show that depletion of adenosine in the TME by the repurposed drug PEGylated Adenosine Deaminase (PEG-ADA) increases CD8+ T cell anti-tumor activity and enhances response to ICI therapy in preclinical models of cancer. Our results suggest that use of PEG-ADA is a viable therapeutic option to overcome ICI therapeutic resistance in advanced cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "The collective behavior of active agents, whether herds of wildebeest or microscopic actin filaments propelled by molecular motors, is an exciting frontier in biological and soft matter physics. Almost three decades ago, Toner and Tu developed a hydrodynamic theory of the collective action of flocks, or herds, that helped launch the modern field of active matter. One challenge faced when applying continuum active matter theories to living phenomena is the complex geometric structure of biological environments. Both macroscopic and microscopic herds move on asymmetric curved surfaces, like undulating grass plains or the surface layers of cells or embryos, which can render problems analytically intractable. In this work, we present a formulation of the Toner-Tu flocking theory that uses the finite element method to solve the governing equations on arbitrary curved surfaces. First, we test the developed formalism and its numerical implementation in channel flow with scattering obstacles and on cylindrical and spherical surfaces, comparing our results to analytical solutions. We then progress to surfaces with arbitrary curvature, moving beyond previously accessible problems to explore herding behavior on a variety of landscapes. Our approach allows the investigation of transients and dynamic solutions not revealed by analytic methods. It also enables versatile incorporation of new geometries and boundary conditions and efficient sweeps of parameter space. Looking forward, the work presented here lays the groundwork for a dialogue between Toner-Tu theory and data on collective motion in biologically-relevant geometries, from drone footage of migrating animal herds to movies of microscopic cytoskeletal flows within cells.",
