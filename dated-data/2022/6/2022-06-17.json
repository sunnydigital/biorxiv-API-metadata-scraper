    "abstract": "More than 500 kinases phosphorylate [~]15% of all human proteins. The architecture of the phosphorylation network has been studied extensively, for instance to compile global interaction maps, trace signal transduction pathways or identify chemical intervention points. In contrast, systematic investigation of local motifs is rare but may provide a complementary understanding of network and kinase function. Here, we report on the occurrence, topology and experimental analysis of convergent kinase-substrate relationships (cKSRs) in which [&ge;]two kinases phosphorylate the same substrate. Through bioinformatics analysis we found that human cKSRs are frequent and involve >80% of all kinases and >24% of all substrates. We show that cKSRs occur over a wide range of stoichiometries harnessing converging kinases that are in many instances recruited from the same family subgroup and co-expressed. Experimentally, we demonstrate at the prototypical convergent CDK4/6 kinase pair how multiple inputs at the major tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein (RB) can hamper in situ analysis of individual kinases. We hypothesized that overexpression of one kinase combined with a CDK4/6 inhibitor can dissect convergence. In breast cancer cells that express high levels of CDK4, we confirmed this hypothesis and developed a high throughput compatible assay that sensitively quantifies genetically modified CDK6 variants and small molecule or protein inhibitors. Collectively, our work provides deeper insights into the phosphorylation network through the identification and analysis of kinase convergence.",

    "abstract": "Mcm2, a subunit of the Mcm2-7 helicase best known for its role in DNA replication, contains a histone binding motif that facilitates the transfer of parental histones following DNA replication. Here we show that Mcm2 is important for the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Mcm2-2A mutation defective in histone binding impairs differentiation and disrupts the programmatic changes in gene expression and histone modifications during differentiation. Mcm2 localizes at transcription starting sites and the binding of Mcm2 at gene promoters is disrupted in both Mcm2-2A ES cells and neuro-precursor cells (NPCs). Reduced Mcm2 binding at bivalent chromatin domains containing repressive H3K27me3 and active H3K4me3 modifications in Mcm2-2A ES cells correlates with decreased chromatin accessibility at corresponding sites in NPCs. Together, our studies reveal a novel function of Mcm2 in ES cell differentiation, likely through manipulating chromatin landscapes at bivalent chromatin domains.",

    "abstract": "Microalgae are pivotal in maintaining water quality in the lakes and rivers of Qinghai-Tibet plateau. The optimum sewage treatment conditions for Desmodesmus sp. are, temperature: 20-25{degrees}C, light intensity: 3000-8000 lx, and pH: 7.0-7.5, identified based on orthogonal experiments. The maximum removal rate of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and chemical oxygen demand was more than 95% in the actual sewage treatment. The sewage treatment capacity of Desmodesmus sp. from plateau is higher than that from plains under the same treatment conditions. To identify the differentially expressed genes and metabolites in Desmodesmus sp. in response to sewage treatment, a combination of metabolomics and transcriptomics was employed to the microalgae with and without sewage treatment. The results showed that the oxidative phosphorylation, photosynthesis, and propanoate metabolism pathways were the most significantly enriched pathways in sewage treatment. Further, the metabolism of adenosine diphosphate, 2-oxobutanoate, and succinate were significantly upregulated, downregulated, and both upregulated and downregulated, respectively, as shown by the combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis. Additionally, we found that sewage treatment could also induce numerous changes in the primary metabolism, such as carbohydrate, fatty acid biosynthesis, and amino acid metabolism when compared with control. Overall, our results should improve fundamental knowledge of molecular responses to Desmodesmus sp. in sewage treatment and contribute to the design of strategies in microalgae response to sewage treatment.",

The environmental impacts of invasive alien insects are varied and widespread, with evidence to suggest that an insect species global maximum impact is likely to increase in severity as it increases its non-native distribution. Two potential explanations are that large geographic distributions include environmental heterogeneity and increase resource availability, or that there are intrinsic factors of widely-spread species that also facilitate greater impacts. Determining which explanation is more likely, and developing a more comprehensive and general understanding of the environmental impacts of invasive alien species, can be assisted by addressing the information shortfalls highlighted in this research.",

    "abstract": "Urban environments are critical points for biological invasions because these areas are susceptible to a greater number of environmental disturbances. Because they are densely populated ecosystems, urban environments present a unique opportunity for the involvement of society in the management of invasive exotic species. Similarly, citizen science offers opportunities to conduct research in the field of ecology together with society. The objective of our study was to analyze the occurrence of exotic species in urban areas recorded on iNaturalist and determine whether citizen science applications are good data sources for research projects in invasion ecology. Specifically, we evaluated whether richness and composition of the exotic species community in the cities registered on the iNaturalist platform were explained by socioeconomic and environmental factors. We also verified whether richness of the exotic species in cities registered on the iNaturalist platform were similar to the richness of the exotic species community in the region where the city is located using data collected only by researchers. We obtained 38,374 occurrences of 265 invasive species covering 2,057 cities in 72 countries. Occurrence records were concentrated in North America, Western Europe and Oceania, and there were no data for cities in most of Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe and West Asia. Socioeconomic and environmental factors were important determinants of the richness of exotic species in urban areas of the world and were important determinants of the richness of exotic species in natural environments. Urban hotspots of invasive exotic species were different from those for ecosystems in general.",

    "abstract": "Collisions between DNA replication complexes (replisomes) and impediments such as damaged DNA or proteins tightly bound to the chromosome lead to premature dissociation of replisomes at least once per cell cycle in Escherichia coli. Left unrepaired, these events produce incompletely replicated chromosomes that cannot be properly partitioned into daughter cells. DNA replication restart, the process that reloads replisomes at prematurely terminated sites, is therefore essential in E. coli and other bacteria. Three replication restart pathways have been identified in E. coli: PriA/PriB, PriA/PriC, and PriC/Rep. A limited number of genetic interactions between replication restart and other genome maintenance pathways have been defined, but a systematic study placing replication restart reactions in a broader cellular context has not been performed. We have utilized transposon insertion sequencing to identify new genetic interactions between DNA replication restart pathways and other cellular systems. Known genetic interactors with the priB replication restart gene (uniquely involved in the PriA/PriB pathway) were confirmed and several novel priB interactions were discovered. Far fewer connections were found with the PriA/PriC or PriC/Rep pathways, suggesting a primacy role for the PriA/PriB pathway in E. coli. Targeted genetic and imaging-based experiments with priB and its genetic partners revealed significant double-strand DNA break (DSB) accumulation in strains with mutations in dam, rep, rdgC, lexA, or polA. Modulating the activity of the RecA recombinase partially suppressed the detrimental effects of rdgC or lexA mutations in {Delta}priB cells. Taken together, our results highlight roles for several genes in DSB homeostasis and define a genetic network that facilitates DNA repair/processing upstream of PriA/PriB-mediated DNA replication restart in E. coli.\n\nAuthor SummaryAll organisms rely on DNA replication to grow, develop, and reproduce. In bacteria, the cellular machinery that carries out DNA replication is estimated to fail and prematurely dissociate from the genome at least once per cell cycle. As a result, bacteria have evolved \"DNA replication restart\" mechanisms that resuscitate failed replication reactions. To probe the function and context of DNA replication restart in the bacterium Escherichia coli, we employed a genetic screen to identify genes that were conditionally important in mutant E. coli strains compromised in their ability to perform DNA replication restart. Identification of genes with previously known relationships with DNA replication restart confirmed the robustness of our screen, while additional findings implicated novel genetic relationships. Targeted experiments validated the importance of these genes and provided an explanation for their significance in preventing double-strand DNA breaks in cells, a severe form of DNA damage. Our results help to define specific roles for the genes identified by our screen and elucidate the contextual environment of DNA repair upstream of DNA replication restart in E. coli.",

The composition of microbial populations is normally determined by comparing DNA sequences sampled from those populations with the sequences stored in genomic databases. Therefore, the amount of information available in databanks should be expected to constrain the accuracy of microbiome analyses. Albeit normally ignored in microbiome studies, this constraint could severely compromise the reliability of microbiome data. To test this hypothesis, we generated virtualomes, virtual bacterial populations that exhibit the ecological structure of real-world microbiomes. Confronting the analyses of virtualomes with their original composition revealed critical issues in the current approach to characterizing microbiomes, issues that were empirically confirmed by analyzing the microbiome of Galleria mellonella larvae. To reduce the uncertainty of microbiome data, the effort in the field must be channeled towards significantly increasing the amount of available genomic information.",

Here, using transgenic mouse models of metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma, we found that Pygo2 deletion decelerated tumor progression, diminished metastases, and extended survival. Pygo2 loss augmented the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and sensitized tumor cells to T cell killing. Mechanistically, Pygo2 orchestrated a p53/Sp1/Kit/Ido1 signaling network to foster a microenvironment hostile to CTLs. Genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Pygo2 enhanced the anti-tumor efficacy of immunotherapies using immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive cell transfer, or myeloid-derived suppressor cell inhibitors. In human prostate cancer samples, Pygo2 expression was inversely correlated with CD8+ T cells.

However, the mechanism how -synuclein (-syn) accumulate in MSA brain remains unclear. Here, we identify the protein epsin-2 as a novel target for MSA therapy via controlling -synuclein accumulation. In MSA mouse model, PLP-hSyn transgenic mice and FABP7/-syn hetero-aggregates injected mice, we firstly found that fatty acid-binding protein 7 (FABP7) related to MSA development and formed hetero-aggregates with -syn, which exhibited stronger toxicity than -syn aggregates. Furthermore, injected FABP7/-syn hetero-aggregates in mice selectively accumulated in oligodendrocytes and Purkinje neurons and cause cerebellar dysfunction. By bioinformatic analyses, the protein epsin-2 expresses in both oligodendrocyte and Purkinje cells was found as a potential target to regulate FABP7/-syn hetero-aggregates propagation via clathrin-dependent endocytosis. The AAV5-dependent epsin-2 knock-down mice exhibited decreased levels of aggregates accumulation in Purkinje neurons and oligodendrocytes as well as performed improved myelin levels and Purkinje neurons in cerebellum and motor functions.

    "abstract": "Changes in the frequency content of sounds over time are arguably the most basic form of information about the behavior of sound-emitting objects. In perceptual studies, such changes have mostly been investigated separately, as aspects of either pitch or timbre. Here, we propose a unitary account of \"up\" and \"down\" subjective judgments of frequency change, based on a model combining auditory correlates of acoustic cues in a sound-specific and listener-specific manner. To do so, we introduce a generalized version of so-called Shepard tones, allowing symmetric manipulations of spectral information on a fine scale, usually associated to pitch (spectral fine structure, SFS), and on a coarse scale, usually associated timbre (spectral envelope, SE). In a series of behavioral experiments, listeners reported \"up\" or \"down\" shifts across pairs of generalized Shepard tones that differed in SFS, in SE, or in both. We observed the classic properties of Shepard tones for either SFS or SE shifts: subjective judgements followed the smallest log-frequency change direction, with cases of ambiguity and circularity. Interestingly, when both SFS and SE changes were applied concurrently (synergistically or antagonistically), we observed a trade-off between cues. Listeners were encouraged to report when they perceived \"both\" directions of change concurrently, but this rarely happened, suggesting a unitary percept. A computational model could accurately fit the behavioral data by combining different cues reflecting frequency changes after auditory filtering. The model revealed that cue weighting depended on the nature of the sound. When presented with harmonic sounds, listeners put more weight on SFS-related cues, whereas inharmonic sounds led to more weight on SE-related cues. Moreover, these stimulus-based factors were modulated by inter-individual differences, revealing variability across listeners in the detailed recipe for \"up\" and \"down\" judgments. We argue that frequency changes are tracked perceptually via the adaptive combination of a diverse set of cues, in a manner that is in fact similar to the derivation of other basic auditory dimensions such as spatial location.",

    "abstract": "Total joint arthroplasty is a common surgical procedure resulting in improved quality of life; however, a leading cause of surgery failure is periprosthetic joint infection. Periprosthetic infection often involves biofilms, making treatment challenging. Periprosthetic joint infections are difficult to diagnose by traditional culturing methods and there are no clinical biomarkers for the presence of biofilms. Further, the metabolic state of pathogens in the joint space is difficult to diagnose, the mechanism of their tolerance to antibiotics and host defenses is not well understood, and their culturing in the laboratory is challenging. Thus, there is a critical need for improved pathogen- and phenotype-specific diagnosis as well as improved treatment strategies toward better patient outcomes. Here, we present a quantitative, untargeted NMR-based metabolomics strategy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa suspended culture and biofilm phenotypes grown in bovine synovial fluid. We identified 21 unique metabolites as potential markers of P. aeruginosa and one unique marker of the biofilm phenotype in synovial fluid. Significant differences in metabolic pathways were found between the suspended culture and biofilm phenotypes including creatine, glutathione, alanine, and choline metabolism and the tricarboxylic acid cycle. These unique metabolite and pathway differences have the potential to serve as targets for P. aeruginosa and specifically biofilm diagnosis and biofilm control in synovial fluid.\n\nAuthor SummaryJoint replacement surgery is a common procedure frequently required in later stages of life due to damage in the joint. Over one million joint replacement surgeries are performed annually with rates increasing every year. A devastating complication associated with joint replacement is the development of infection around the implant device in the joint space, known as a periprosthetic joint infection. Bacteria in the joint space can form a biofilm, which is a gel-like matrix encasing the cells that increases resistance to treatment and exacerbates chronic infections. A particular challenge for the diagnosis of biofilm-mediated periprosthetic joint infections is the slowly growing nature of biofilm-mediated phenotypes, resulting in frequent failure to detect these bacteria by clinical microbiological culturing methods. Small molecule metabolites are uniquely produced by strains of bacteria in the biofilm versus planktonic or suspended culture phenotype. Identification of metabolites as specific markers of infection and biofilm could allow a new culture-free diagnostic approach to diagnose infection by biofilm. Furthermore, knowledge of metabolic pathway populations in biofilm in joint fluid could point to specific targets to prevent biofilm formation in the joint space.",

Contaminated soil and water are the major transmission sources in humans and animals. Clusters of disease outbreaks are common during rainy seasons.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsIn this study, to detect the presence of Leptospira, we applied PCR, direct metagenomic sequencing, and enrichment culture followed by metagenomic sequencing on water and soil samples. Direct sequencing and enrichment cultures followed by PCR or sequencing effectively detected pathogenic and nonpathogenic Leptospira compared to direct PCR and 16S amplification-based metagenomic sequencing in soil or water samples. Among multiple culture media evaluated, Ellinghausen-McCullough-Johnson-Harris (EMJH) media containing antimicrobial agents was superior in recovering and detecting Leptospira from the environmental samples. Our results show that enrichment culture followed by PCR can be used to confirm the presence of pathogenic Leptospira in environmental samples. Metagenomic sequencing on enrichment cultures effectively detects the abundance and diversity of Leptospira spp from environmental samples.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceThe selection of methodology is critical when testing environmental samples for the presence of Leptospira. Selective enrichment culture improves Leptospira detection efficacy by PCR or metagenomic sequencing and can be used successfully to understand the presence and diversity of pathogenic Leptospira during environmental surveillance.\n\nAuthor SummaryLeptospirosis, a life-threatening disease in humans and animals, is one of the most widespread global zoonosis. Contaminated soil and water are major sources of transmission in humans and animals. For this reason, clusters of disease outbreaks are common during the rainy season. In this study, Leptospira enrichment cultures followed by PCR and sequencing detected pathogenic and nonpathogenic Leptospira in soil and water samples. The pathogenic and intermediate groups of Leptospira were more prevalent in soil samples tested. Metagenomic sequencing on enrichment culture is effective in detecting the abundance and diversity of various Leptospira spp. in environmental samples. Soil samples in proximity to water may be an ideal niche for Leptospira growth and survival and may be an appropriate sample of choice for testing.",

Adding RNase 1:1 to HNP1 at the standard inoculum of 5x105 CFU/mL did not enhance activity. Increasing the inoculum to 6.25x107 CFU/mL almost abrogated HNP1 activity. However, adding RNase 25:1 to HNP1 enhanced activity. Adding both tRNA and RNase resulted in enhanced activity, indicating that the enhancement effect of RNase overwhelms the inhibiting effect of tRNA when both are present. HBD1 activity at the standard inoculum was almost completely abrogated by the addition of tRNA, but LL-37 activity was only slightly inhibited by tRNA. At the high inoculum, LL-37 activity was enhanced by RNase. HBD1 activity was not enhanced by RNase. RNase was not antimicrobial in the absence of antimicrobial peptides. Cell clumps were observed at the high inoculum in the presence of all three antimicrobial peptides and at the standard inoculum in the presence of HNP1+tRNA.\n\nConclusionsAntimicrobial peptide-ribonuclease combinations have the potential to be active against high cell concentrations and biofilms, conditions where the antimicrobial agent alone is relatively ineffective.",

    "abstract": "Kruppel-like transcription factor 7 (KLF7) promotes preadipocyte proliferation; however, its target gene in this process has not yet been identified. Using KLF7 ChIP-seq analysis, we previously showed that a KLF7-binding peak is present upstream of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 3 gene (CDKN3) in chicken preadipocytes. In the current study, we identified CDKN3 as a target gene of KLF7 that mediates the effects of KLF7 on preadipocyte proliferation. Furthermore, 5'-truncating mutation analysis showed that the minimal promoter was located between CDKN3 nt -160 and nt -7 (relative to the translation initiation codon ATG). KLF7 overexpression increased CDKN3 promoter activity in the DF-1 and immortalized chicken preadipocyte (ICP1) cell lines. Deletion of the putative binding site of KLF7 abolished the promotive effect of KLF7 overexpression on CDKN3 promoter activity. Moreover, CDKN3-knockdown and -overexpression assays revealed that CDKN3 enhanced ICP1 cell proliferation. Flow cytometry analysis showed that CDKN3 accelerated the G1/S transition. Further, we found that KLF7 promoted ICP1 cell proliferation via Akt phosphorylation by regulating CDKN3. Taken together, these results suggest that KLF7 promotes preadipocyte proliferation via activating the Akt signaling pathway by cis-regulating CDKN3, thus driving the G1/S transition.",

    "abstract": "Laboratory experiments suggest that rapid cycling of antibiotics during the course of treatment could successfully counter resistance evolution. Drugs involving collateral sensitivity could be particularly suitable for such therapies. However, the environmental conditions in-vivo differ from those in-vitro. One key difference is that drugs can be switched abruptly in the lab, while in the patient, pharmacokinetic processes lead to changing antibiotic concentrations including periods of dose overlaps from consecutive administrations. During such overlap phases, drug-drug interactions may affect the evolutionary dynamics. To address the gap between the lab and potential clinical applications, we set up two models for comparison - a  lab model and a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic  patient model. The analysis shows that in the lab, the most rapid cycling suppresses the bacterial population always at least as well as other regimens. For patient treatment, however, a little slower cycling can sometimes be preferable if the pharmacodynamic curve is steep or if drugs interact antagonistically. When resistance is absent prior to treatment, collateral sensitivity brings no substantial benefit unless the cell division rate is low and drug cycling slow. By contrast, drug-drug interactions strongly influence the treatment efficiency of rapid regimens, demonstrating their importance for the optimal choice of drug pairs.",

Fascin is also overexpressed in most solid tumours where it supports invasion through control of F-actin structures at the periphery and nuclear envelope. Recently fascin has been identified in the nucleus of a broad range of cell types but the contributions of nuclear fascin to cancer cell behaviour remain unknown. Here we demonstrate that fascin bundles F-actin within the nucleus to support chromatin organisation and efficient DNA damage response. Fascin associates directly with phosphorylated Histone H3 leading to regulated levels of nuclear fascin to support these phenotypes. Forcing nuclear fascin accumulation through the expression of nuclear-targeted fascin-specific nanobodies or inhibition of Histone H3 kinases results in enhanced and sustained nuclear F-actin bundling leading to reduced invasion, viability and nuclear fascin-specific/driven apoptosis. These findings represent an additional important route through which fascin can support tumorigenesis and provide insight into potential pathways for targeted fascin-dependent cancer cell killing.",

    "abstract": "Tumor cells respond to a host of factors from the local microenvironment. Microenvironmental fatty acids can be used by melanoma cells for fuel, but their effects on transcription and epigenetics are still unclear. Here, we show that the fatty acid {beta}-oxidation (FAO) pathway integrates signaling and epigenetics to drive melanoma progression. Using transgenic zebrafish and human cell lines, we find that octanoate, a medium-chain fatty acid, increases tumorigenesis. Octanoate is metabolized via the FAO/ACLY axis into acetyl-CoA, leading to increased histone acetylation. Transcriptomic and epigenetic analyses demonstrate a convergence of inflammatory gene signatures in octanoate-treated melanoma cells. This signature is mediated by TLR4/MyD88 signaling, which is activated by saturated fatty acids like octanoate. Genetic inactivation of either FAO enzymes or TLR4/MyD88 inhibits alterations in histone acetylation, and rescues octanoate-tumor promoting effects. Together, these data demonstrate clear evidence linking fatty acid metabolism and epigenetics to melanoma pathogenesis through TLR4 signaling.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of virulence in plant-pathogenic fungi has emerged as a key area of importance underlying host infections. Recent work has highlighted the role of transcription factors (TFs) that mediate the expression of virulence-associated genes. A prominent example is Pf2, a member of the Zn2Cys6 family of fungal TFs, where orthologues regulate the expression of genes linked to parasitism in several plant-pathogen lineages. These include PnPf2 which controls effector-gene expression in Parastagonospora nodorum, thereby determining the outcome of effector-triggered susceptibility on its host, wheat. PnPf2 is a promising target for disease suppression but the genomic targets, or whether other are regulators involved, remain unknown. This study used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) and a mutagenesis analysis to investigate these components. Two distinct binding motifs connected to positive gene-regulation were characterised and genes directly targeted by PnPf2 were identified. These included genes encoding major effectors and other components associated with the P. nodorum pathogenic lifestyle, such as carbohydrate-active enzymes and nutrient assimilators. This supports a direct involvement of PnPf2 in coordinating virulence on wheat. Other TFs were also prominent PnPf2 targets, suggesting it also operates within a transcriptional network. Several TFs were therefore functionally investigated in connection to fungal virulence. Distinct metabolic and developmental roles were evident for the newly characterised PnPro1, PnAda1, PnEbr1 and the carbon-catabolite repressor PnCreA. Overall, the results uphold PnPf2 as the central transcriptional regulator orchestrating genes that contribute to virulence on wheat and provide mechanistic insight into how this occurs.\n\nImportanceFungal pathogens cause large crop losses worldwide and consequently much attention has focused on improving host genetic resistance to diseases. These pathogens use effectors, which require coordinated expression at specific stages of the pathogenic lifecycle, to manipulate the host plant metabolism in favour of infection. However, our understanding of the underlying regulatory network in coordination with other genes involved in fungal pathogenicity is lacking. The Pf2 TF orthologues are key players underpinning virulence and effector gene expression in several fungal phytopathogens, including P. nodorum. This study provided significant insight into the DNA-binding regulatory mechanisms of P. nodorum PnPf2, as well as further evidence that it is central to the coordination of virulence. In the context of crop protection, the Pf2 taxonomic orthologues present opportune targets in major fungal pathogens that can be perturbed to reduce the impact of effector triggered-susceptibility and improve disease resistance.",

Nevertheless, applying the 1/n rule generates conflicts of interest both among cartel members themselves and between members and non-members which might lead to the self-purification of the academic publishing industry.",

Herein, we seek to use multimodal single-cell analysis to comprehensively define immune cell phenotypes, proportions and functional characteristics in preschool children with CF. We analyzed 42,658 cells from bronchoalveolar lavage of 11 preschool children with CF and a healthy control using scRNA-seq and parallel assessment of 154 cell surface proteins. Validation of cell types identified by scRNA-seq was achieved by assessment of samples by spectral flow cytometry. Analysis of transcriptome expression and cell surface protein expression, combined with functional pathway analysis, revealed 41 immune and epithelial cell populations in BAL. Spectral flow cytometry analysis of over 256,000 cells from a subset of the same patients revealed high correlation in major cell type proportions across the two technologies. Macrophages consisted of 13 functionally distinct sub populations, including previously undescribed populations enriched for markers of vesicle production and regulatory/repair functions. Other novel cell populations included CD4 T cells expressing inflammatory IFN/{beta} and NF{kappa}B signalling genes.

For dendrite arborization, Spire required intact structural domains to nucleate actin and target the secretory network, and Spire interacted with Rab11 GTPase, a key regulator of recycling endosomes.

    "abstract": "We present a hierarchical and empirical Bayesian framework for testing hypotheses about synaptic neurotransmission, based on the integration of ultra-high field magnetic resonance spectroscopy (7T-MRS) and magnetoencephalography data (MEG). A first level dynamic causal modelling of cortical microcircuits is used to infer the connectivity parameters of a generative model of individuals neurophysiological observations. At the second level, individuals 7T-MRS estimates of regional neurotransmitter concentration supply empirical priors on synaptic connectivity. We compare the group-wise evidence for alternative empirical priors, defined by monotonic functions of spectroscopic estimates, on subsets of synaptic connections. For efficiency and reproducibility, we used Bayesian model reduction (BMR), parametric empirical Bayes and variational Bayesian inversion. In particular, we used Bayesian model reduction to compare models of how spectroscopic neurotransmitter measures inform estimates of synaptic connectivity. This identifies the subset of synaptic connections that are influenced by neurotransmitter levels, as measured by 7T-MRS. We demonstrate the method using resting-state MEG (i.e., task-free recording) and 7T-MRS data from healthy adults. We perform cross-validation using split-sampling of the MEG dataset. Our results confirm the hypotheses that GABA concentration influences local recurrent inhibitory intrinsic connectivity in deep and superficial cortical layers, while glutamate influences the excitatory connections between superficial and deep layers and connections from superficial to inhibitory interneurons. The method is suitable for applications with magnetoencephalography or electroencephalography, and is well-suited to reveal the mechanisms of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including responses to psychopharmacological interventions.",

    "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the meningeal compartment plays instrumental roles in various neurological disorders and can modulate neurodevelopment and behavior. While this has sparked great interest in the meninges, we still lack fundamental knowledge about meningeal biology. Here, we utilized high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) techniques to investigate the transcriptional response of the meninges to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and aging in the sub-acute and chronic time frames. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we first explored how mild TBI affects the cellular and transcriptional landscape in the meninges in young mice at one week post-injury. Then, using bulk RNA sequencing, we assessed the differential long-term outcomes between young and aged mice following a TBI. In our scRNA-seq studies, we found that mild head trauma leads to an activation of type I interferon (IFN) signature genes in meningeal macrophages as well as the mobilization of multiple distinct sub-populations of meningeal macrophages expressing hallmarks of either classically activated or wound healing macrophages. We also revealed that dural fibroblasts in the meningeal compartment are highly responsive to TBI, and pathway analysis identified differential expression of genes linked to various neurodegenerative diseases. For reasons that remain poorly understood, the elderly are especially vulnerable to head trauma, where even mild injuries can lead to rapid cognitive decline and devastating neuropathology. To better understand the differential outcomes between the young and the elderly following brain injury, we performed bulk RNA-seq on young and aged meninges from mice that had received a mild TBI or Sham treatment 1.5 months prior. Notably, we found that aging alone induced massive upregulation of meningeal genes involved in antibody production by B cells and type I IFN signaling. Following injury, the meningeal transcriptome had largely returned to its pre-injury signature in young mice. In stark contrast, aged TBI mice still exhibited massive upregulation of immune-related genes and markedly reduced expression of genes involved in extracellular matrix remodeling and maintenance of cellular junctions. Overall, these findings illustrate the dynamic and complex transcriptional response of the meninges to mild head trauma. Moreover, we also reveal how aging modulates the meningeal response to TBI.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496485v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14fe137org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14afa25org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ca643org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17a8a0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Comparing pOmpT with cOmpT in terms of structure, proteolytic activity and target substrates, it is found that Asp267 and Ser276 of cOmpT are substrate-binding sites and help its catalytic center to cleave substrates (protamine,synthetic peptide or RNase 7). However, special structural features and the nature of residues Ser267 and Thr276 of pOmpT caused the inability of cleavage protamine, but allows it to specifically cleave the human AMP RNase 7. It is suggested that two sites are related with the substrate specificity. In short, we found that pOmpT presents a new structural basis for the specific recognition of substrates, and providing new clues for the development of antimicrobial drugs.",

    "abstract": "Alternative splicing occurs in the vast majority of human genes, giving rise to distinct mRNA and protein isoforms. We, and others, have previously identified hundreds of genes that change their isoform expression upon T cell activation via alternative splicing; however, how these changes link activation input with functional output remains largely unknown. Here we investigate how costimulation of T cells through the CD28 receptor impacts alternative splicing in T cells activated through the T cell receptor (CD3) and find that while CD28 signaling alone has minimal impact on splicing, it enhances the extent of change for up to 20% of TCR-induced alternative splicing events. Interestingly, a set of CD28-enhanced splicing events occur within genes encoding key components of the apoptotic signaling pathway; namely caspase-9, Bax and Bim. Using both CRISPR-edited cells and antisense oligos to force expression of specific isoforms, we show for all three of these genes that the isoform induced by CD3/CD28 costimulation promotes resistance to apoptosis, and that changes in all three genes together function combinatorially to further promote cell viability. Finally, we show that the JNK signaling pathway, induced downstream of CD3/CD28 costimulation, is required for each of these splicing events, further highlighting their co-regulation. Together these findings demonstrate that alternative splicing is a key mechanism by which costimulation of CD28 promotes viability of activated T cells.",

    "abstract": "Expression of the HIV-1 genome by RNA Polymerase II is regulated at multiple steps, as are most cellular genes, including recruitment of general transcription factors and control of transcriptional elongation from the core promoter. We recently discovered that tripartite motif protein TRIM24 is recruited to the HIV-1 Long Terminal Repeat (LTR) by interaction with TFII-I and causes transcriptional elongation by stimulating association of PTEF-b/ CDK9. Because TRIM24 is required for stimulation of transcription from the HIV-1 LTR, we were surprised to find that IACS-9571, a specific inhibitor of the TRIM24 C-terminal bromodomain, induces HIV-1 provirus expression in otherwise untreated cells. IACS-9571 reactivates HIV-1 in T cell lines bearing multiple different provirus models of HIV-1 latency. Additionally, treatment with this TRIM24 bromodomain inhibitor encourages productive HIV-1 expression in newly infected cells and inhibits formation of immediate latent transcriptionally repressed provirus. IACS-9571 synergizes with PMA, ionomycin, TNF- and PEP005 to activate HIV-1 expression. Furthermore, co-treatment of CD4+ T cells from individuals with HIV-1 on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with PEP005 and IACS-9571 caused robust provirus expression. Notably, IACS-9571 did not cause global activation of T cells; rather, it inhibited induction of IL2 and CD69 expression in human PBMCs and Jurkat T cells treated with PEP005 or PMA. These observations indicate the TRIM24 bromodomain inhibitor IACS-9571 represents a novel HIV-1 latency reversing agent (LRA), and unlike other compounds with this activity, causes partial suppression of T cell activation while inducing expression of latent provirus.",

    "abstract": "After endocytosis, transmembrane cargo is differentially sorted into degradative or recycling pathways. This process is facilitated by recruitment into physically distinct degradative or recycling microdomains on the limiting membrane of individual endosomes. Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) mark the degradative microdomain, while the recycling domain is marked by the retromer complex and associated proteins RME-8 and SNX-1. The separation of endosomal microdomains is also controlled by RME-8 and SNX-1, at least in part via removal of degradative component HRS/HGRS-1 from the recycling microdomain. This activity is likely due to recruitment and activation of chaperone Hsc70 to the recycling microdomain by the RME-8 DNAJ domain. To better understand the mechanism of RME-8 function we performed a new phylogenetic analysis of RME-8 and identified new conserved sequence features. In a complementary approach, we performed structure-function analysis that identified the C-terminus as important for microdomain localization and likely substrate binding, while N-terminal sequences beyond the known single N-terminal PH-like domain are important for endosome recruitment. Random mutagenesis identified IWN4, and by analogy IWN3, to be important for the inhibitory DNAJ domain binding. Combining AlphaFold structural predictions with in vivo truncation and point mutation analysis of RME-8, we propose a model whereby SNX-1 and the IWN domains control the conformation of RME-8 and hence the productive exposure of the DNAJ domain. Furthermore, we propose that the activation of RME-8 is cyclical, with SNX-1 acting as an activator and a target of RME-8 uncoating activity.",

    "abstract": "Spermatogenesis is a key process for the sexual reproduction species. In lepidopteran insects, dichotomous spermatogenesis is a notable feature, which produces eupyrene (nucleate) and apyrene (anucleate) spermatozoa. Both sperm morphs are essential for fertilization, as eupyrene sperm fertilizes the egg, while apyrene sperm is necessary for eupyrene sperm migration. In Drosophila, Prmt5 acts as a type II arginine methyltransferase to catalyze the symmetrical dimethylation of arginine residues (sDMA) in Vasa. However, Prmt5 is involved in regulating spermatogenesis, but Vasa is not. To date, the functional genetic study on dichotomous spermatogenesis in the lepidopteran model Bombyx mori has been limited, thus the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. In this study, we report that both BmPrmt5 and BmVasa act as essential components in the regulation of dichotomous spermatogenesis in Bombyx mori. The loss-of-function mutants of BmPrmt5 ({Delta}BmPrmt5) and BmVasa ({Delta}BmVasa) derived from CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing show similar male and female-sterile phenotypes. Through immunofluorescence staining analysis, we found that the morphs of both{Delta} BmPrmt5 and{Delta} BmVasa sperm show severe defects, indicating an essential role for both BmPrmt5 and BmVasa in the regulation of dichotomous spermatogenesis. RNA-seq analyses indicate that the defects in dichotomous spermatogenesis observed for{Delta} BmPrmt5 and{Delta} BmVasa mutants could be attributed to the reduced expression of the spermatogenesis-related genes including Sex-lethal (BmSxl), implying that BmSxl may act downstream of Prmt5 and Vasa in regulating apyrene sperm development. These findings suggest that BmPrmt5 and BmVasa constitute an integral regulatory module essential for dichotomous spermatogenesis in Bombyx mori, in which BmPrmt5 may promote BmVasa activity through sDMA modification.\n\nAuthor SummaryDichotomous spermatogenesis is a notable feature in Lepidoptera insects, in which a single male produces nucleated and anucleated dimorphic sperm. Both sperm morphs are essential for fertilization, as the eupyrene sperm fertilizes the egg, while the apyrene sperm assists in transporting the eupyrene sperm to the female sperm storage organs. To date, the mechanism of dichotomous spermatogenesis is still unclear, as very limited components participating in this process have been reported. Here we defined the function of BmPrmt5 (Protein arginine methyltransferase 5) and its substrate BmVasa in dichotomous spermatogenesis in the lepidopteran insect Bombyx mori. Our genetic analyses revealed that both BmPrmt5 and BmVasa are essential for dichotomous spermatogenesis. Moreover, RNA-seq analyses, in conjunction with the genetic and immunofluorescence staining analyses, suggest a potential regulatory pathway consisting of the BmPrmt5-BmVasa module in dichotomous spermatogenesis in Bombyx mori. This study expands the knowledge of reproduction biology in insects, and may provide potential gene targets for pest control.",

    "abstract": "Zoonotic disease dynamics in wildlife hosts are rarely quantified at macroecological scales due to the lack of systematic surveys. Non-human primates (NHPs) host Plasmodium knowlesi, a zoonotic malaria of public health concern and the main barrier to malaria elimination in Southeast Asia. Understanding of regional P. knowlesi infection dynamics in wildlife is limited. Here, we systematically assemble reports of NHP P. knowlesi and investigate geographic determinants of prevalence in reservoir species. Meta-analysis of 6322 NHPs from 148 sites reveals that prevalence is heterogeneous across Southeast Asia, with low overall prevalence and high estimates for Malaysian Borneo. We find that regions exhibiting higher prevalence in NHPs overlap with human infection hotspots. In wildlife and humans, parasite transmission is linked to land conversion and fragmentation. By assembling remote sensing data and fitting statistical models to prevalence at multiple spatial scales, we identify novel relationships between P. knowlesi in NHPs and forest fragmentation. This suggests that higher prevalence may be contingent on habitat complexity, which would begin to explain observed geographic variation in parasite burden. These findings address critical gaps in understanding regional P. knowlesi epidemiology and indicate that prevalence in simian reservoirs may be a key spatial driver of human spillover risk.",

On flat solid surfaces, the limb-stepping patterns can be characterized according to the direction in which limbaggregates propagate, opposite to (retrograde) or with the direction of motion (direct). It is unknown how limb and body dynamics are modified in terrain with terradynamic complexity more representative of their natural heterogeneous environments. Here, we investigated how centipedes that use retrograde and direct limp-stepping patterns, S. polymorpha and S. sexspinosus, respectively, coordinate their body and limbs to navigate laboratory environments which present footstep challenges and terrain rugosity. We recorded the kinematics and measured the locomotive performance of these animals traversing two rough terrains with randomly distributed step heights and compared the kinematics to those on a flat frictional surface. S. polymorpha exhibited similar body and limb dynamics across all terrains and a decrease in speed with increased terrain roughness. Unexpectedly, when placed in a rough terrain, S. sexspinosus changed the limb-stepping pattern from direct to retrograde. Further, for both species, traversal of rough terrains was facilitated by hypothesized passive mechanics: upon horizontal collision of a limb with a block, the limb passively bent and later continued the stepping pattern. While centipedes have many degrees of freedom. our results suggest these animals negotiate limb-substrate interactions and navigate complex terrains, by offloading complex control and leveraging the innate flexibility of their limbs.",

We find that a hitherto unstudied linker, between the RFTS and CXXC domains, plays a key role for activation. It contains a conserved -helix which engages a crucial \"Toggle\" pocket, displacing a previously described inhibitory linker, and allowing the DNA recognition helix to spring into the active conformation. This is accompanied by large-scale reorganization of the inhibitory RFTS and CXXC domains, allowing the enzyme to gain full activity.

Genetically engineered mouse models aim to faithfully mimic the complexity of human cancers and, when appropriately aligned, represent ideal pre-clinical systems to test new drug treatments. Despite its importance, dual-species classification has been limited by the lack of a reliable approach. Here we utilise, develop and test a set of options for human-to-mouse CMS classifications of CRC tissue.\n\nMETHODSUsing transcriptional data from established collections of CRC tumours, including human (TCGA cohort; n=577) and mouse (n=57 across n=8 genotypes) tumours with combinations of random forest and nearest template prediction algorithms, alongside gene ontology collections, we comprehensively assess the performance of a suite of new dual-species classifiers.\n\nRESULTSWe developed three approaches: MmCMS-A; a gene-level classifier, MmCMS-B; an ontology-level approach and MmCMS-C; a combined pathway system encompassing multiple biological and histological signalling cascades. Although all options could identify tumours associated with stromal-rich CMS4-like biology, MmCMS-A was unable to accurately classify the biology underpinning epithelial-like subtypes (CMS2/3) in mouse tumours.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWhen applying human-based transcriptional classifiers to mouse tumour data, a pathway-level classifier, rather than an individual gene-level system, is optimal.

Distinct subpopulations of MP CD4+ T cells are specifically activated by IL-1 family cytokines and STAT activators, revealing that the cells have TCR-independent effector functions. Especially, CCR6high MP CD4+ T cells are major responders to IL-1{beta} and IL-23 without MOG35-55 antigen reactivity, which gives them pathogenic-Th17 characteristics and allows them to contribute to autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We identified Bhlhe40 in CCR6high MP CD4+ T cells drives the expression of GM-CSF, contributing to CNS pathology in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Collectively, our findings reveal heterogeneity of MP CD4+ T cells that can contribute to autoimmune neuroinflammation in bystander manner synergistically with antigen-specific T cells.",

    "abstract": "The human-specific bacterial pathogen Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Macrophages are important to control GAS infection, but previous data indicate that GAS can persist in macrophages. In this study, we detail the molecular mechanisms by which GAS survives in THP-1 macrophages. Our fluorescence microscopy studies demonstrate that GAS are readily phagocytosed by macrophages, but persist within phagolysosomes. These phagolysosomes are not acidified, which is in agreement with our findings that GAS cannot survive in low pH environments. We find that the secreted pore-forming toxin Streptolysin O (SLO) perforates the phagolysosomal membrane, allowing leakage of not only protons, but large proteins including the lysosomal protease cathepsin B. Additionally, GAS blocks the activity of vacuolar ATPase (v-ATPase) to prevent acidification of the phagolysosome. Thus, while GAS does not inhibit fusion of the lysosome with the phagosome, it has multiple mechanisms to prevent proper phagolysosome function, allowing for persistence of the bacteria within the macrophage. This has important implications for not only the initial response but the overall functionality of the macrophages, which may lead to the resulting pathologies in GAS infection. Our data suggests that therapies aimed at improving macrophage function may positively impact patient outcomes in GAS infection.",

    "abstract": "The estimation of effective population sizes (Ne) through time is of fundamental interest in population genetics, but the interpretation of Ne as the effective number of breeding individuals in the population is challenged by the effect of population structure. In fact, variation in Ne reported in many studies may be a consequence of changes in migration rates between populations rather than changes in actual population size. We address this long-standing problem here by constructing joint models of population size changes, migration, and divergence that can adjust temporal estimates of Ne and estimate the actual Ne of a local deme connected to another population through migration. We also develop a method for estimating divergence times and migration rates taking into account complex scenarios of changing population sizes. We apply the method to previously published data from humans, and show that, when taking migration and changes in Ne into account, the estimated divergence between the San and Dinka populations is approximately 108 kya, and not 255 kya as reported in a previous study. Using simulations, we demonstrate that the previously reported and surprisingly old estimates of divergence between San and Dinka is in fact caused by a quantifiable estimation bias due to changes in Ne through time.",

We have studied the main electrostatic features involved in the interaction of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with the human receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). As the principal computational tool, we have used the FORTE approach, capable to model proton fluctuations and computing free energies for a very large number of protein-protein systems under different physical-chemical conditions, here focusing on the RBD-ACE2 interactions. Both the wild-type and all critical variants are included in this study. From our large ensemble of extensive simulations, we obtain, as a function of pH, the binding affinities, charges of the proteins, their charge regulation capacities, and their dipole moments. In addition, we have calculated the pKas for all ionizable residues and mapped the electrostatic coupling between them. We are able to present a simple predictor for the RBD-ACE2 binding based on the data obtained for Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants, as a linear correlation between the total charge of the RBD and the corresponding binding affinity. This \"RBD charge rule\" should work as a quick test of the degree of severity of the coming SARS-CoV-2 variants in the future.\n\nCategories and Subject Descriptors:",

    "abstract": "The majority of the transcribed genome does not have coding potential but is composed of non-coding transcripts that are involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes. Regulation of gene expression is important in determining the response of organisms to changes in the environment, and therefore their persistence as population or species under global change. However, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are scarcely studied especially in non-model organisms due to the lack of a reliable pipeline for their accurate identification and annotation. Here, we present a pipeline which uses a combination of alignment-dependent and independent methods for the identification of conserved and species-specific lncRNAs from RNA-Seq data. Validation of this pipeline was performed using existing RNA-Seq data from Acanthochromis polyacanthus brain tissue, identifying a total of 4,728 lncRNAs across the genome, the majority of which (3,272) are intergenic. To investigate the possible implications of these intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), we estimated the expression changes of lincRNAs and coding genes in response to ocean acidification. We found lincRNAs which neighbour or possibly trans-regulate differentially expressed coding genes related to pH regulation, neural signal transduction and ion transport, which are known to be important in the response to ocean acidification in fish. Overall, this pipeline enables the use of existing RNA sequencing data to reveal additional underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the response to environmental changes by integrating the study of lncRNAs with gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Structural waters in the S1 binding pocket of {beta}-trypsin are critical for the stabilization of the complex of {beta}-trypsin with its inhibitor bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI). The inhibitor strength of BPTI can be modulated by replacing the critical lysine residue at the P1 position by non-natural amino acids. We study BPTI variants in which the critical Lys15 in BPTI has been replaced by -aminobutyric acid (Abu) and its fluorinated derivatives monofluoroethylglycine (MfeGly), difluoroethylglycine (DfeGly) and trifluoroethylglycine (TfeGly). We investigate the hypothesis that additional water molecules in the binding pocket can form specific non-covalent interactions to the fluorinated side chains and thereby act as an extension of the inhibitors. We report potentials of mean force (PMF) of the unbinding process for all four complexes and enzyme activity inhibition assays. Additionally, we report the protein crystal structure of the Lys15MfeGly-BPTI-{beta}-trypsin complex (pdb: 7PH1). Both, experimental and computational data, show a step-wise increase in inhibitor strength with increasing fluorination of the Abu side chain. The PMF additionally shows a minimum for the encounter complex and an intermediate state just before the bound state. In the bound state, the computational analysis of the structure and dynamics of the water molecules in the S1 pocket shows a highly dynamic network of water molecules that does not indicate a rigidification or stabilizing trend in regards to energetic properties that could explain the increase in inhibitor strength. The analysis of the enthalpy and the entropy of the water molecules in the S1 binding pocket using Grid Inhomogeneous Solvation Theory confirms this result. Overall, fluorination systematically changes the binding affinity but the effect cannot be explained by a persistent water network in the binding pocket. Other effects, such as the hydrophobicity of fluorinated amino acids and the stability of the encounter complex as well as the additional minimum in the potential of mean force in the bound state, likely influence the affinity more directly.\n\nTOC GRAPHIC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=124 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/496563v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1177443org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d20760org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e252ecorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b22121_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Human in vitro bone models can create the possibility for investigation of physiological bone remodeling while addressing the principle of replacement, reduction and refinement of animal experiments (3R). Current in vitro models lack cell-matrix interactions and their spatiotemporal complexity. To facilitate these analyses, a bone-mimetic template was developed in this study, inspired by bones extracellular matrix composition and organization. Silk fibroin (SF) was used as an organic matrix, poly-aspartic acid (pAsp) was used to mimic the functionality of non-collagenous proteins, and 10x simulated body fluid served as mineralization solution. By using pAsp in the mineralization solution, minerals were guided towards the SF material resulting in mineralization inside and as a coating on top of the SF. After cytocompatibility testing, remodeling experiments were performed in which mineralized scaffold remodeling by osteoclasts and osteoblasts was tracked with non-destructive micro-computed tomography and medium analyses over a period of 42 days. The mineralized scaffolds supported osteoclastic resorption and osteoblastic mineralization, in the physiological bone remodeling specific sequence. This model could therefore facilitate the investigation of cell-matrix interactions and may thus reduce animal experiments and advance in vitro drug testing for bone remodeling pathologies like osteoporosis, where cell-matrix interactions need to be targeted.",

Nonviral delivery methods rely on the application of polymers, liposomes and cationic lipid systems used as vehicle. Among these systems, there is increasing interest in surfactants, which, due to their ability to complex with nucleic acids can deliver into cell DNA or RNA molecules of almost any size, which is unattainable with viral gene delivery systems.The main aim of this study was to determine the effect of the concentration of lactose-based surfactants (zwitterionic derivatives of sulfobetaine with carbohydrate moieties) on the structure of DNA/RNA as well as to explore their abilities of nucleic acid complexation. Structural studies of DNA or RNA in complexes with surfactants of two types at various concentrations were conducted using circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, gel electrophoresis (GE) and synchrotron radiation small angle X-ray scattering (SR-SAXS). Our studies showed that the examined surfactants have excellent properties of forming complexes with DNA and RNA. Additionally, to determine the cytotoxicity and transfection abilities of the studied lipoplexes, preliminary tests were performed in HeLa and fibroblast cells. The obtained results suggest that these systems have relatively low toxicity; however, further research is needed in this area.",

    "abstract": "Introductory paragraphWhile CAR T cells have altered the treatment landscape for B cell malignancies, the risk of on-target, off-tumor toxicity has hampered their development for solid tumors because most target antigens are shared with normal cells1,2. Researchers have attempted to apply Boolean logic gating to CAR T cells to prevent on-target, off-tumor toxicity3-7; however, a truly safe and effective logic-gated CAR has remained elusive8. Here, we describe a novel approach to CAR engineering in which we replace traditional ITAM-containing CD3{zeta} domains with intracellular proximal T cell signaling molecules. We demonstrate that certain proximal signaling CARs, such as a ZAP-70 CAR, can activate T cells and eradicate tumors in vivo while bypassing upstream signaling proteins such as CD3{zeta}. The primary role of ZAP-70 is to phosphorylate LAT and SLP-76, which form a scaffold for the propagation of T cell signaling. We leveraged the cooperative role of LAT and SLP-76 to engineer Logic-gated Intracellular NetworK (LINK) CAR, a rapid and reversible Boolean-logic AND-gated CAR T cell platform that outperforms other systems in both efficacy and the prevention of on-target, off-tumor toxicity. LINK CAR will dramatically expand the number and types of molecules that can be targeted with CAR T cells, enabling the deployment of these powerful therapeutics for solid tumors and diverse diseases such as autoimmunity9 and fibrosis10. In addition, this work demonstrates that the internal signaling machinery of cells can be repurposed into surface receptors, a finding that could have broad implications for new avenues of cellular engineering.",

    "abstract": "Habituation allows animals to learn to ignore persistent but inconsequential stimuli. Despite being the most basic form of learning, a consensus model on the underlying mechanisms has yet to emerge. To probe relevant mechanisms we took advantage of a visual habituation paradigm in larval zebrafish, where larvae reduce their reactions to abrupt global dimming (a dark flash). We used Ca2+ imaging during repeated dark flashes and identified 12 functional classes of neurons that differ based on their rate of adaptation, stimulus response shape, and anatomical location. While most classes of neurons depressed their responses to repeated stimuli, we identified populations that did not adapt, or that potentiated their response. These neurons were distributed across brain areas, consistent with a distributed learning process. Using a small molecule-screening approach, we confirmed that habituation manifests from multiple distinct molecular mechanisms, and we have implicated molecular pathways in habituation, including: Melatonin, Estrogen and GABA signaling. However, by combining anatomical analyses and pharmacological manipulations with Ca2+ imaging, we failed to identify a simple relationship between pharmacology, altered activity patterns, and habituation behaviour. Collectively, our work indicates that habituation occurs via a complex and distributed plasticity processes that cannot be captured by a simple model. Therefore, untangling the mechanisms of habituation will likely require dedicated approaches aimed at sub-component mechanisms underlying this multidimensional learning process.",

However, these LFPs are often contaminated with electrocardiographic (ECG) artifacts that impede the detection of physiomarkers for adaptive DBS research. This study systematically compared the ability of different ECG suppression methods to recover disease-specific electrical brain activity from ECG-contaminated LFPs.\n\nApproachThree ECG suppression methods were evaluated: (1) QRS interpolation of the Perceive toolbox, (2) four variants of a template subtraction method, and (3) sixteen variants of a singular value decomposition (SVD) method. The performance of these methods was examined using LFPs recorded with the Medtronic PerceptTM PC system from the subthalamic nucleus in nine patients with Parkinsons disease while stimulation was turned off (\"OFF-DBS\"; anode disconnected) and while stimulation was turned on at 0 mA (\"ON-DBS 0 mA\"; anode connected). In addition, ECG-contaminated LFPs were simulated by scaling a co-recorded external ECG signal and adding it to the OFF-DBS LFPs.\n\nMain ResultsECG artifacts were present in 10 out of 18 ON-DBS 0 mA recordings. All ECG suppression methods were able to drastically reduce the percent difference of beta band (13 - 35 Hz) spectral power and at least partly recover the beta peak and beta burst dynamics. Using predetermined R-peaks improved the performance of the ECG suppression methods. Lengthening the time window around the R-peaks resulted in stronger reduction in artifact-induced beta band power but at an increased risk of flattening the beta peak and loss of beta burst dynamics.\n\nSignificanceThe SVD method formed the preferred trade-off between artifact cleaning and signal loss, as long as its parameter settings (time window around the R-peaks; number of components) are adequately chosen.",

We conducted a genome-wide in vivo CRISPR screen in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model of MS and identified 18 essential facilitators of T cell migration that include known targets of MS therapies. Combining in vitro studies with in vivo cell transfer and multiphoton microscopy enabled us to reveal three functional modules, centred around the adhesion molecule 4-integrin, the chemokine receptor CXCR3, and the GRK2 kinase, that are required for the migration of autoreactive CD4+ T cells into the CNS. Single-cell analysis of T cells from patients with MS confirmed that the expression of the essential regulators correlates with the propensity of CD4+ T cells to reach the CNS.

    "abstract": "SAR11 bacteria dominate the surface ocean and are major players in converting fixed carbon back to atmospheric carbon dioxide. The SAR11 clade is comprised of niche-specialized ecotypes that display distinctive spatiotemporal transitions. We analysed SAR11 ecotype seasonality in two long-term 16S rRNA amplicon time series representing different North Atlantic regimes: the Sargasso Sea (subtropical ocean-gyre; BATS) and the temperate coastal Western English Channel (WEC). Using phylogenetically resolved amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), we evaluated seasonal environmental constraints on SAR11 ecotype periodicity. Despite large differences in temperature and nutrient availability between the two sites, at both SAR11 succession was defined by summer and winter clusters of ASVs. Summer cluster was dominated by ecotype Ia.3 in both sites. Winter clusters were dominated by ecotypes Ib and IIa.A at BATS and Ia.1 and IIa.B at WEC. A two-year weekly analysis within the WEC time series showed that the response of SAR11 communities to short-term environmental fluctuations was variable. In 2016, community shifts were abrupt and synchronised to environmental shifts. However, in 2015, changes were gradual and decoupled from environmental fluctuations, likely due to increased mixing from strong winds. We demonstrate that interannual weather variability disturb the pace of SAR11 seasonal progression.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLymphadenitis is the most common extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) manifestation and a major cause of death. The microbiome is important to human health but uninvestigated in EPTB. We profiled the site-of-disease lymph node microbiome in tuberculosis lymphadenitis (TBL).\n\nMethodsFine needle aspiration biopsies (FNABs) were collected from 159 pre-treatment presumptive TBL patients in Cape Town, South Africa. 16S Illumina MiSeq rRNA gene sequencing was done.\n\nResultsWe analysed 89 definite TBLs (dTBLs) and 61 non-TBLs (nTBLs), which had similar -but different {beta}-diversities (p=0.001). Clustering identified five lymphotypes prior to TB status stratification: Mycobacterium-, Prevotella- and Streptococcus-dominant lymphotypes were more frequent in dTBLs whereas a Corynebacterium-dominantlymphotype and a fifth lymphotype (no dominant taxon) were more frequent in nTBLs. When restricted to dTBLs, clustering identified a Mycobacterium-dominant lymphotype with low -diversity and other non-Mycobacterium-dominated lymphotypes (termed Prevotella-Corynebacterium and Prevotella-Streptococcus). The Mycobacterium dTBL lymphotype was associated with HIV-positivity and clinical features characteristic of severe lymphadenitis (e.g., node size). dTBL microbial communities were enriched with potentially proinflammatory microbial short chain fatty acid metabolic pathways (propanoate, butanoate) vs. those in nTBLs. 11% (7/61) of nTBLs had Mycobacterium reads.\n\nConclusionsTBL at the site-of-disease is not microbially homogenous and distinct microbial community clusters exist that are associated with different immunomodulatory potentials and clinical characteristics. Non-Mycobacterium-dominated dTBL lymphotypes, which contain taxa potentially targeted by TB treatment, represent less severe potentially earlier stage disease. These investigations lay foundations for studying the microbiomes role in lymphatic TB and the long-term clinical significance of lymphotypes requires prospective evaluation.",

    "abstract": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) forms contacts with the lysosomal compartment, regulating lysosome positioning and motility. The movement of lysosomes are controlled by the attachment of molecular motors to their surface. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ER controls lysosome dynamics are still elusive. Here, we demonstrate that spatacsin is an ER-resident protein that regulates ER-lysosomes contacts to promote lysosome motility, shown by the presence of tubular lysosomes. Tubular lysosomes, which are highly dynamic, are entangled in a network of tubular ER. Screening for spatacsin partners required for tubular lysosome formation showed spatacsin to act by regulating protein degradation. We demonstrate that spatacsin promotes the degradation of its partner AP5Z1, which regulates the relative amount of spastizin and AP5Z1 at lysosomes. Spastizin and AP5Z1 contribute to lysosome trafficking by interacting with anterograde and retrograde motor proteins, kinesin KIF13A and dynein/dynactin subunit p150Glued, respectively. Ultimately, investigations in polarized neurons demonstrated that spatacsin-regulated degradation of AP5Z1 controls the directionality of lysosomes trafficking. Collectively, our results identify spatacsin as a protein regulating the directionality of lysosome trafficking.",

    "abstract": "The type I transmembrane protein BT-IgSF is predominantly localized in the brain and testes. It belongs to the CAR subgroup of Ig cell adhesion proteins, which have been hypothesized to regulate connexin expression or localization. Here, we studied the putative link between BT-IgSF and connexins in astrocytes, ependymal cells and neurons of the mouse. Global knockout of BT-IgSF caused an increase in the clustering of connexin43 (Gja1), but not of connexin30 (Gjb6), on astrocytes and ependymal cells. Additionally, knockout animals displayed reduced expression levels of connexin43 protein in the cortex and hippocampus. Importantly, analysis of biocytin spread in hippocampal or cortical slices from mature mice of either sex revealed a decrease in astrocytic cell-cell coupling in the absence of BT-IgSF. Blocking either protein biosynthesis or proteolysis showed that the lysosomal pathway increased connexin43 degradation. Localization of connexin43 in subcellular compartments was not impaired in the mutant. In contrast to connexin43 the localization and expression of connexin36 (Gjd2) on neurons was not affected by the absence of BT-IgSF. Overall, our data indicate that the IgCAM BT-IgSF is essential for correct gap junction-mediated astrocyte-to-astrocyte and ependymal cell-to-ependymal cell communication.\n\nSignificance StatementAstrocytes regulate a variety of physiological processes in the developing and adult brain that are essential for proper brain function. Astrocytes form extensive networks in the brain and communicate via gap junctions. Disruptions of gap junction coupling are found in several diseases such as neurodegeneration or epilepsy. Here, we demonstrate that the cell adhesion protein BT-IgSF is essential for gap junction mediated coupling between astrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus.",

    "abstract": "Hair cells of the inner ear are particularly sensitive to changes in mitochondria, the subcellular organelles necessary for energy production in all eukaryotic cells. There are over thirty mitochondrial deafness genes, and mitochondria are implicated in hair cell death following noise exposure, aminoglycoside antibiotic exposure, as well as in age-related hearing loss. However, little is known about the basic aspects of hair cell mitochondrial biology. Using hair cells from the zebrafish lateral line as a model and serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we have quantifiably characterized a unique hair cell mitochondrial phenotype that includes (1) a high mitochondrial volume, and (2) specific mitochondrial architecture: multiple small mitochondria apically, and a reticular mitochondrial network basally. This phenotype develops gradually over the lifetime of the hair cell. Disrupting this mitochondrial phenotype with a mutation in opa1 impacts mitochondrial health and function. While hair cell activity is not required for the high mitochondrial volume, it shapes the mitochondrial architecture, with mechanotransduction necessary for all patterning, and synaptic transmission necessary for development of mitochondrial networks. These results demonstrate the high degree to which hair cells regulate their mitochondria for optimal physiology, and provide new insights into mitochondrial deafness.",

    "abstract": "Most pathogens are generalists capable of infecting multiple host species or strains. Trade-offs in performance among different hosts are expected to limit the evolution of generalism. Despite the commonness of generalism, the variation in infectivity, transmission, and trade-offs in performance among host species have rarely been studied in the wild. To understand the ecological and evolutionary drivers of multi-host pathogen infectivity and transmission potential, I studied disease severity, transmission dynamics and infectivity variation of downy mildew pathogen Peronospora sparsa on its three host plants Rubus arcticus, R. chamaemorus, and R. saxatilis. In a survey of 19 wild and cultivated sites of the three host species, disease severity varied by host species and by whether the focal host species grew in shared habitat with other host species. Generally, the presence of an alternative host resulted in lower disease severity. To understand how alternative host presence and plant diversity affect on transmission of the pathogen, I conducted a trap plant experiment. In contrast to the field survey observations, the presence of R. saxatilis was positively correlated with transmission to trap plants. To understand how resistance to P. sparsa varies among host species and genotypes, I conducted an inoculation experiment using 10 P. sparsa strains from different locations and 20 genotypes of the three host species. Significant variation in infectivity was found among host genotypes but not among host species. The pathogens strains originating form sites with R. saxatilis were less infective than those without. When trade-offs for infectivity were tested, high infectivity in one host species correlated with high infectivity in another host species. However, when pathogen transmission-related life-history correlations were tested, a positive correlation was found in R. arcticus but not in R. saxatilis. The results suggest that host resistance may shape pathogen life-history evolution with epidemiological consequences in a multi-host pathogen.",

    "abstract": "In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, virus replication in the central nervous system (CNS) can result in HIV-associated neurocognitive deficits in approximately 25% of patients with unsuppressed viremia and is thought to be characterized by evolutionary adaptation to this unique microenvironment. While no single mutation can be agreed upon as distinguishing the neuroadapted population from virus in patients without neuropathology, earlier studies have demonstrated that a machine learning (ML) approach could be applied to identify a collection of mutational signatures within the envelope glycoprotein (Env Gp120) predictive of disease. The S[imian] IV-infected macaque is a widely used animal model of HIV neuropathology, allowing in-depth tissue sampling infeasible for human patients. Yet, translational impact of the ML approach within the context of the macaque model has not been tested, much less the capacity for early prediction in other, non-invasive tissues. We applied the previously described ML approach to prediction of SIV-mediated encephalitis (SIVE) using gp120 sequences obtained from the CNS of animals with and without SIVE with 73% accuracy. The presence of SIVE signatures at earlier time points of infection in non-CNS tissues in both SIVE and SIVnoE animals indicated these signatures cannot be used in a clinical setting. However, combined with protein structural mapping and statistical phylogenetic inference, results revealed common denominators associated with these signatures, including 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-beta-D-glucopyranose structural interactions and the infection of alveolar macrophages. Alveolar macrophages were demonstrated to harbor a relatively large proportion (35 - 100%) of SIVE-classified sequences and to be the phyloanatomic source of cranial virus in SIVE, but not SIVnoE animals. While this combined approach cannot distinguish the role of this cell population as an indicator of cellular tropism from a source of neuroadapted virus, it provides a key to understanding the function and evolution of the signatures identified as predictive of both HIV and SIV neuropathology.\n\nAuthor summaryHIV-associated neurocognitive disorders remain prevalent among HIV-infected individuals, even in the era of potent antiretroviral therapy, and our understanding of the mechanisms involved in disease pathogenesis, such as virus evolution and adaptation, remains elusive. In this study, we expand on a machine learning method previously used to predict neurocognitive impairment in HIV-infected individuals to the macaque model of AIDS-related neuropathology in order to characterize its translatability and predictive capacity in other sampling tissues and time points. We identified four amino acid and/or biochemical signatures associated with disease that, similar to HIV, demonstrated a proclivity for proximity to aminoglycans in the protein structure. These signatures were not, however, isolated to specific points in time or even to the central nervous system, as they could be observed at low levels during initial infection and from various tissues, most prominently in the lungs. The spatiotemporal patterns observed limit the use of these signatures as an accurate prediction for neuropathogenesis prior to the onset of symptoms, though results from this study warrant further investigation into the role of these signatures, as well as lung tissue, in viral entry to and replication in the brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe provide a reproducible and scalable Snakemake workflow, called RNA-Seq-Pop, which provides end-to- end analysis of RNA-Seq data sets. The workflow allows the user to perform quality control, differential expression analyses, call genomic variants and generate a range of summary statistics. Additional options include the calculation of allele frequencies of variants of interest, summaries of genetic variation and population structure (in measures such as nucleotide diversity, Wattersons {theta}, and PCA), and genome wide selection scans (Fst, PBS), together with clear visualisations. We demonstrate the utility of the workflow by investigating pyrethroid-resistance in selected strains of the major malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae. The workflow provides additional modules specifically for An. gambiae, including estimating recent ancestry and determining the karyotype of common chromosomal inversions.\n\nResultsThe Busia lab-colony used for selections was collected in Busia, Uganda, in November 2018. We performed a comparative analysis of three groups: a parental G24 Busia strain; its deltamethrin-selected G28 offspring; and the susceptible reference strain Kisumu. Measures of genetic diversity reveal patterns consistent with that of laboratory colonisation and selection, with the parental Busia strain exhibiting the highest nucleotide diversity of 1.04{middle dot}10-3, followed by the selected Busia offspring (7.1{middle dot}10-4), and finally, Kisumu (6.2{middle dot}10-4). Differential expression and variant analyses reveal that the selected Busia colony exhibits a number of distinct mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance, including the Vgsc-995S target-site mutation, upregulation of SAP genes, P450s, and a cluster of carboxylesterases. During deltamethrin selections, the 2La chromosomal inversion rose in frequency (from 33% to 86%), suggesting a link with pyrethroid resistance, which was previously observed in field samples from the same region. RNA-Seq-Pop analysis also reveals that the most widely-used insecticide-susceptible An. gambiae strain, Kisumu, appears to be a hybrid strain of An. gambiae and its sibling species An. coluzzii, which should be taken into consideration in future research.\n\nRNA-Seq-Pop is designed for ease of use, does not require programming skills and integrates the package manager Conda to ensure that all dependencies are automatically installed for the user. We anticipate that the workflow will provide a useful tool to facilitate reproducible, transcriptomic studies in An. gambiae and other taxa.",

    "abstract": "Metastatic cancer remains almost inevitably a lethal disease. A better understanding of disease progression and response to therapies therefore remains of utmost importance. Here, we characterize the genomic differences between early-stage untreated primary tumors and late-stage treated metastatic tumors using a harmonized pan-cancer (re-)analysis of 7,152 whole-genome-sequenced tumors. In general, our analysis shows that metastatic tumors have a low intra-tumor heterogeneity, high genomic instability and increased frequency of structural variants with comparatively a modest increase in the number of small genetic variants. However, these differences are cancer type specific and are heavily impacted by the exposure to cancer therapies. Five cancer types, namely breast, prostate, thyroid, kidney clear carcinoma and pancreatic neuroendocrine, are a clear exception to the rule, displaying an extensive transformation of their genomic landscape in advanced stages. These changes were supported by increased genomic instability and involved substantial differences in tumor mutation burden, clock-based molecular signatures and the landscape of driver alterations as well as a pervasive increase in structural variant burden. The majority of cancer types had either moderate genomic differences (e.g., cervical and colorectal cancers) or highly consistent genomic portraits (e.g., ovarian cancer and skin melanoma) when comparing early- and late-stage disease. Exposure to treatment further scars the tumor genome and introduces an evolutionary bottleneck that selects for known therapy-resistant drivers in approximately half of treated patients. Our data showcases the potential of whole-genome analysis to understand tumor evolution and provides a valuable resource to further investigate the biological basis of cancer and resistance to cancer therapies.",

For example, music is a universal and learned human behavior that is characterized by different rhythms and tempos that can evoke disparate responses in listeners. Similarly, birdsong is a ubiquitous social behavior in birds that is learned during critical periods in development and used to evoke physiological and behavioral responses in listeners. Recent investigations have begun to reveal the breadth of universal patterns in birdsong and their similarity to common patterns in speech and music, but relatively little is known about the degree to which biological predispositions and developmental experiences interact to shape the temporal patterning of birdsong. Here, we investigated how biological predispositions modulate the acquisition and production of an important temporal feature of birdsong, namely the duration of silent intervals (\"gaps\") between vocal elements (\"syllables\"). Through analyses of semi-naturally raised and experimentally tutored zebra finches, we observed that juvenile zebra finches imitate the durations of the silent gaps in their tutors song with high fidelity and can \"alter\" the durations of gaps toward a central duration. When juveniles were experimentally tutored with stimuli containing a wide range of gap durations, we observed biases in the stereotypy but not in the central tendency of gap durations. Together, these studies demonstrate how biological predispositions and developmental experiences differently affect distinct temporal features of birdsong and highlight similarities in developmental plasticity across birdsong, speech, and music.",

We achieved software acceleration using beam search methods that were successfully used for fast secondary structure prediction from a single RNA sequence. Benchmark analyses showed that LinAliFold and CentroidLinAliFold were much faster than the existing methods while preserving the prediction accuracy. As an empirical application, we predicted the consensus secondary structure of coronaviruses with approximately 30,000 nt in 5 and 76 minutes by LinAliFold and CentroidLinAliFold, respectively. We confirmed that the predicted consensus secondary structure of coronaviruses was consistent with the experimental results.

    "abstract": "We develop a finite-cell model of tumor natural selection dynamics to investigate the stochastic fluctuations associated with multiple rounds of adaptive chemotherapy. The adaptive cycles are designed to avoid chemo-resistance in the tumor by managing the ecological mechanism of competitive release of a resistant sub-population. Our model is based on a three-component evolutionary game played among healthy (H), sensitive (S), and resistant (R) populations of N cells, with a chemotherapy control parameter, C(t), used to dynamically impose selection pressure on the sensitive sub-population to slow tumor growth but manage competitive release of the resistant population. The adaptive chemo-schedule is designed based on the deterministic (N [-&gt;] {infty}) adjusted replicator dynamical system, then implemented using the finite-cell stochastic frequency dependent Moran process model (N = 10K - 50K) to ascertain the size and variations of the stochastic fluctuations associated with the adaptive schedules. We quantify the stochastic fixation probability regions of the R and S populations in the HSR tri-linear phase plane as a function of the control parameter C [isin] [0, 1], showing that the size of the R region increases with increasing C. We then implement an adaptive time-dependent schedule C(t) for the stochastic model and quantify the variances (using principal component coordinates) associated with the evolutionary cycles for multiple rounds of adaptive therapy, showing they grow according to power-law scaling. The simplified low-dimensional model provides some insights on how well multiple rounds of adaptive therapies are likely to perform over a range of tumor sizes if the goal is to maintain a sustained balance among competing sub-populations of cells so as to avoid chemo-resistance via competitive release in a stochastic environment.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale genome engineering in yeast is feasible primarily due to prodigious homology-directed DNA repair (HDR), a plethora of genetic tools, and simple conversion between haploid and diploid forms. However, a major challenge to rationally building multi-gene processes in yeast arises due to the combinatorics of combining all of the individual edits into the same strain. Here, we present an approach for scalable, precise, multi-site genome editing that combines all edits into a single strain without the need for selection markers by using CRISPR-Cas9 and gene drives. First, we show that engineered loci become resistant to the corresponding CRISPR reagent, allowing the enrichment of distinct genotypes. Next, we demonstrate a highly efficient gene drive that selectively eliminates specific loci by integrating CRISPR-Cas9 mediated Double-Strand Break (DSB) generation and homology-directed recombination with yeast sexual assortment. The method enables Marker-less Enrichment and Recombination of Genetically Engineered loci (MERGE) in yeast. We show that MERGE converts single heterologous yeast loci to homozygous loci at [~]100% efficiency, independent of chromosomal location. Furthermore, MERGE is equally efficient at converting and combining loci, thus identifying viable intermediate genotypes. Finally, we establish the feasibility of MERGE by engineering a fungal carotenoid biosynthesis pathway and most of the human  proteasome core into yeast. MERGE, therefore, lays the foundation for marker-less, highly efficient, and scalable combinatorial genome editing in yeast.",

    "abstract": "When cancers or bacterial infections establish, small populations of cells have to free themselves from homoeostatic regulations that prevent their expansion. Trait evolution allows these populations to evade this regulation, escape stochastic extinction and climb up the fitness landscape. In this study, we analyse this complex process and investigate the fate of a cell population that underlies the basic processes of birth, death and mutation. We find that the shape of the fitness landscape dictates a circular adaptation trajectory in the trait space spanned by birth and death rates. We show that successful adaptation is less likely for parental populations with higher turnover (higher birth and death rates). Including density- or trait-affecting treatment we find that these treatment types change the adaptation dynamics in agreement with a geometrical analysis of fitness gradients. Treatment strategies that simultaneously target birth and death rates are most effective, but also increase evolvability. By mapping physiological adaptation pathways and molecular drug mechanisms to traits and treatments with clear eco-evolutionary consequences, we can achieve a much better understanding of the adaptation dynamics and the eco-evolutionary mechanisms at play in the dynamics of cancer and bacterial infections.",

    "abstract": "The single pellet reaching and grasp (SPRG) task is a behavioural assay widely used to study motor learning, control and recovery after nervous system injury in animals. The manual training and assessment of the SPRG is labour intensive and time consuming and has led to the development of multiple devices which automate the SPRG task. Current state-of-the-art desktop methods either still require attendance, manual classification of trial outcome, or expensive locally-installed hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs). Here, using robotics, computer vision, and machine learning analysis of videos, we describe a novel cost-effective benchtop device that can be left unattended, presents pellets to mice automatically, video records each trial, and, using two supervised learning algorithms, classifies the outcome of each trial automatically with an accuracy of greater than 94% without the use of GPUs. Finally, the device is simple in design with few components meaning manufacturing at scale is straightforward and, with few moving parts, reliable and robust. Our devices can also be operated using our cross-platform Graphical User Interface (GUI), meaning no knowledge of programming is required by its users.\n\nWe show that these devices can train 30 mice with them collectively performing ~83,000 trials over 3 months, saving users an estimated 8 and half hours of labour per day. Over five weeks, most mice undertook more trials per session and retrieved more pellets successfully. 21 out of 30 mice retrieved at least 40% of pellets successfully in at least one session during the training period. Devices measured motor deficits induced in mice by a focal ischaemic stroke; some mice showed large persistent deficits whilst others showed only transient deficits. This highlights the heterogeneity in reaching outcomes following stroke. We conjecture that reach-and-grasp is represented in motor cortex bilaterally but with greater asymmetry in some mice than in others. We predict that bilateral lesions of motor cortex would cause long-lasting deficits in reach-and-grasp in mice.\n\nWe propose a strategy for preclinical evaluation of novel therapeutics that improve reach-and-grasp by pre-screening a large cohort of mice automatically and excluding those that fail to achieve pre-specific success rates, which generates a cohort of mice trained with consistent performance levels, suitable for randomization to treatment arms in a preclinical study. Well-powered sample sizes are easily achievable. Highly parallel automated training and assessment should accelerate the development of new therapies for movement disorders.",

Here we present a cryo-electron microscopic structure of a target DNA-bound Cas12k-transposon recruitment complex comprising RNA-guided Cas12k, TniQ, TnsC and, unexpectedly, the ribosomal protein S15. Complex assembly on target DNA results in complete R-loop formation mediated by critical interactions between TniQ and the trans-activating crRNA, and is coupled with TniQ-dependent nucleation of a TnsC filament. In vivo transposition assays corroborate our structural findings, and biochemical and functional analyses of S15 supports its role as a bona fide component of the type V crRNA-guided transposition machinery.

Despite this promise, human-guided cryo-EM data collection practices limit the impact of cryo-EM because of a path planning problem: cryo-EM datasets typically represent 2-5% of the total sample area. Here, we address this fundamental problem by formalizing cryo-EM data collection as a path planning optimization from low signal data. Within this framework, we incorporate reinforcement learning (RL) and deep regression to design an algorithm that uses distributed surveying of cryo-EM samples at low magnification to learn optimal cryo-EM data collection policies. Our algorithm - cryoRL - solves the problem of path planning on cryo-EM grids, allowing the algorithm to maximize data quality in a limited time without human intervention. A head-to-head comparison of cryoRL versus human subjects shows that cryoRL performs in the top 10% of test subjects, surpassing the majority of users in collecting high-quality images from the same sample. CryoRL establishes a general framework that will enable human-free cryo-EM data collection to increase the impact of cryo-EM across life sciences research.",

    "abstract": "The CRISPR/Cas9 technology has emerged as a powerful tool to generate mouse models of disease. Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the female genital tract. In the present study, we have developed a pipeline for the generation of somatically engineered mouse models of endometrial cancer by in vivo electroporation-mediated delivery of Cas9 ribonucleoprotein into the uterine cavity. By using mT/mG dual-fluorescent reporter mice, we show that this system allows an efficient genomic edition specifically in epithelial endometrial cells. As a proof of its applicability for endometrial cancer modeling, we designed Cas9 ribonucleoprotein targeting Pten, the most frequently tumor suppressor gene mutated in this type of cancer. Pten-targeting ribonucleoprotein delivery into the uterine cavity caused loss of expression of PTEN protein in epithelial endometrial cells that resulted in the development of endometrial lesions. We also validated this technique for gene edition in other important endometrial driver genes such as p53 or Fbxw7. By co-targeting LoxP sites of mT/mG reporter mice and Pten, we demonstrate the generation of differentially edited cell populations that may be a useful tool to model tumoral heterogeneity. Moreover, the combination of CRISPR/Cas9 technology in mT/mG dual-reporter mice and light-sheet microscopy represents an interesting approach for in vivo cancer cell tracing. This methodology opens a new door for future rapid, flexible, customizable and multiplexable in vivo modeling of endometrial cancer.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear pore complex (NPC) physically interacts with chromatin and regulates gene expression. The inner ring nucleoporin Nup170 has been implicated in chromatin organization and the maintenance of gene silencing in subtelomeric regions. To gain insight into how Nup170 regulates this process, we used protein-protein interaction, genetic interaction, and transcriptome correlation analyses to identify the Ctf18-RFC complex, an alternative proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) loader, as a facilitator of the gene regulatory functions of Nup170. The Ctf18-RFC complex is recruited to a subpopulation of NPCs that lack the nuclear basket proteins Mlp1 and Mlp2. In the absence of Nup170, PCNA levels on DNA are reduced, resulting in the loss of silencing of subtelomeric genes. Increasing PCNA levels on DNA by removing Elg1, which is required for PCNA unloading, rescues subtelomeric silencing defects in nup170{Delta}. The NPC therefore mediates subtelomeric gene silencing by regulating PCNA levels on DNA.",

    "abstract": "Malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites have a complex life cycle and present numerous antigen targets that may contribute to protective immune responses. The currently recommended vaccine--RTS,S--functions by targeting the P. falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP), which is the most abundant surface protein of the sporozoite form responsible for initiating infection of the human host. Despite showing only moderate efficacy, RTS,S has established a strong foundation for the development of next-generation subunit vaccines. Our previous work characterizing the sporozoite surface proteome identified additional non-CSP antigens that may be useful as immunogens individually or in combination with CSP. In this study, we examined eight such antigens using the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii as a model system. We demonstrate that despite conferring weak protection individually, co-immunizing each of several of these antigens alongside CSP, could significantly enhance the sterile protection achieved by CSP immunization alone. Thus, our work provides compelling evidence that a multi-antigen pre-erythrocytic vaccine approach may enhance protection compared to CSP-only vaccines. This lays the groundwork for further studies aimed at testing the identified antigen combinations in human vaccination trials that assess efficacy with controlled human malaria infection.\n\nImportanceThe currently approved malaria vaccine targets a single parasite protein (CSP) and only results in partial protection. We tested several additional vaccine targets in combination with CSP to identify those that could enhance protection from infection upon challenge in the mouse malaria model. In identifying several such enhancing vaccine targets, our work indicates that a multi-protein immunization approach may be a promising avenue to achieving higher levels of protection from infection. Our work identified several candidate leads for follow-up in the models relevant for human malaria, and provides an experimental framework for efficiently carrying out such screens for other combinations of vaccine targets.",

    "abstract": "In their natural environment, most bacteria preferentially live as complex surface-attached multicellular colonies called biofilms. Biofilms begin with a few cells adhering to a surface, where they multiply to form a mature colony. When conditions deteriorate, cells can leave the biofilm. This dispersion is thought to be an important process that modifies the overall biofilm architecture and that promotes colonization of new environments. In Caulobacter crescentus biofilms, extracellular DNA (eDNA) is released upon cell death and prevents newborn cells from joining the established biofilm. Thus, eDNA promotes the dispersal of newborn cells and the subsequent colonization of new environments. These observations suggest that eDNA is a cue for sensing detrimental environmental conditions in the biofilm. Here we show that the toxin-antitoxin ParDE4 stimulates cell death in areas of a biofilm with decreased O2 availability. In conditions where O2 availability is low, eDNA concentration is correlated with cell death. Cell dispersal away from biofilms is decreased when parDE4 is deleted, probably due to the lower local eDNA concentration. Expression of parDE4 is positively regulated by O2 and the expression of this operon is decreased in biofilms where O2 availability is low. Thus, PCD by an O2-regulated toxin-antitoxin system stimulates dispersal away from areas of a biofilm with decreased O2 availability and favors colonization of a new, more hospitable environment.",

The pbp4 promoter-associated mutations have been detected in strains with or without mecA. Our previous studies that were carried out in strains devoid of mecA described that pbp4 promoter-associated mutations lead to PBP4 overexpression and {beta}-lactam resistance. In this study, by introducing various pbp4 promoter-associated mutations in the genome of an MRSA strain, we demonstrate that PBP4 overexpression can supplement mecA-associated resistance in S. aureus and can lead to increased {beta}-lactam resistance. The promoter and regulatory region of pbp4 is shared with a divergently transcribed gene, abcA, which encodes for a multidrug exporter. We demonstrate that the promoter mutations caused an upregulation of pbp4 and downregulation of abcA, confirming that the resistant phenotype is associated with PBP4 overexpression only. PBP4 has also been associated with staphylococcal pathogenesis, however, its exact role remains unclear. Using a C. elegans model, we demonstrate that strains having increased PBP4 expression are less virulent compared to wild-type strains, suggesting that {beta}-lactam resistance mediated via PBP4 likely comes at the cost of virulence.\n\nImportanceOur study demonstrates the ability of PBP4 to be an important mediator of {beta}-lactam resistance in not only Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) background strains as previously demonstrated, but also in MRSA strains. When present together, PBP2a and PBP4 overexpression can produce increased levels of {beta}-lactam resistance, causing complications in treatment. Thus, this study suggests the importance of monitoring PBP4-associated resistance in clinical settings, as well as understanding the mechanistic basis of associated resistance, so that treatments targeting PBP4 may be developed. This study also demonstrates that S. aureus strains with increased PBP4 expression are less pathogenic, providing important hints about the role of PBP4 in S. aureus resistance and pathogenesis.",
