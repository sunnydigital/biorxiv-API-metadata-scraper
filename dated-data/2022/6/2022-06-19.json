    "abstract": "Here we report computational studies of bidirectional transport in an axon, specifically focusing on predictions when the retrograde motor becomes dysfunctional. We are motivated by reports that mutations in dynein-encoding genes can cause diseases associated with peripheral motor and sensory neurons, such as type 2O Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. We use two different models to simulate bidirectional transport in an axon: an anterograde-retrograde model, which neglects passive transport by diffusion in the cytosol, and a full slow transport model, which includes passive transport by diffusion in the cytosol. As dynein is a retrograde motor, dysfunction should not directly influence anterograde transport. However, our modeling results unexpectedly predict that slow axonal transport fails to transport cargos against their concentration gradient without dynein. The reason is the lack of a physical mechanism for the reverse information flow from the axon terminal, which is required so that the cargo concentration at the terminal could influence the cargo concentration distribution in the axon. Mathematically speaking, to achieve a prescribed concentration at the terminal, equations governing cargo transport must allow for the imposition of a boundary condition postulating the cargo concentration at the terminal. Perturbation analysis for the case when the retrograde motor velocity becomes close to zero predicts uniform cargo distributions along the axon. The obtained results explain why slow axonal transport must be bidirectional to allow for the maintenance of concentration gradients along the axon length. Our result is limited to small cargo diffusivity, which is a reasonable assumption for many slow axonal transport cargos (such as cytosolic and cytoskeletal proteins, neurofilaments, actin, and microtubules) which are transported as large multiprotein complexes or polymers.",

    "abstract": "Cancer Hallmarks have been indispensable to rationalize the complex phenotypic properties acquired by cancer cells and their surrounding tumor microenvironment (TME) as they progress from normalcy to malignancy. While great insights have been gained from their use to understand bulk tissue transcriptomics, our knowledge remained incomplete, as it was not possible to determine the origin and relative localization of the activity of each Cancer Hallmark within tumor tissues. Thanks to recent advances in spatial transcriptomics, we can now explore the spatial contribution of each compartment within a tumor to each Cancer Hallmark at near single-cell resolution.\n\nHere, we used spatial transcriptomics from fifteen different primary tumor samples from seven tissues to quantify the contribution of the main tumor compartments -cancer cells and the TME- to each of thirteen Cancer Hallmarks. Our results revealed a Pan-Cancer architecture: with the activity of some hallmarks consistently coming from the cancer compartment across all cancer types (Cancer-associated hallmarks) and the activity of others consistently coming from the TME (TME-associated hallmarks). Furthermore, we observed that even within each compartment (cancer or TME) there was a consistent internal architecture, as many of these hallmarks exhibited higher activity at the border between compartments. Our study provides the first spatial map of Cancer Hallmark activities in tumors at almost cellular resolution, paving the way for a better understanding of the underpinnings of hallmark acquisition by tumor cell types.",

    "abstract": "KdpFABC is a high-affinity prokaryotic K+ uptake system that forms a functional chimera between a channel-like subunit (KdpA) and a P-type ATPase (KdpB). At high K+ levels, KdpFABC needs to be inhibited to prevent excessive K+ accumulation to the point of toxicity. This is achieved by a phosphorylation of the serine residue in the TGES162 motif in the A domain of the pump subunit KdpB (KdpBS162-P). Here, we explore the structural basis of inhibition by KdpBS162 phosphorylation by determining the conformational landscape of KdpFABC under inhibiting and non-inhibiting conditions. Under turnover conditions, we identified a new inhibited KdpFABC conformation that we termed E1-P tight, which is not part of the canonical Post-Albers transport cycle of P-type ATPases. It likely represents the biochemically described stalled E1-P state adopted by KdpFABC upon KdpBS162 phosphorylation. The E1-P tight state exhibits a compact fold of the three cytoplasmic domains and is likely adopted when the transition from high-energy E1-P states to E2-P states is unsuccessful. This study represents a structural characterization of a biologically relevant off-cycle state in the P-type ATPase family and supports the emerging discussion of P-type ATPase regulation by such conformations.",

    "abstract": "While adaptive cancer therapy is beginning to prove a promising approach of building evolutionary dynamics into therapeutic scheduling, the stochastic nature of cancer evolution has rarely been incorporated. Various sources of random perturbations can impact the evolution of heterogeneous tumors. In this paper, we propose a method that can effectively select optimal adaptive treatment policies under randomly evolving tumor dynamics based on Stochastic Optimal Control theory. We first construct a stochastic model of cancer dynamics under drug therapy based on Evolutionary Game theory. That model is then used to improve the cumulative \"cost\", a combination of the total amount of drugs used and the time to recovery. As this cost becomes random in a stochastic setting, we maximize the probability of recovery under a pre-specified cost threshold (or a \"budget\"). We can achieve our goal for a range of threshold values simultaneously using the tools of dynamic programming. We then compare our threshold-aware policies with the policies previously shown to be optimal in the deterministic setting. We show that this threshold-awareness yields a significant improvement in the probability of under-the-budget recovery, which is correlated with a lower general drug usage. The particular model underlying our discussion has originated in [22], but the presented approach is far more general and provides a new tool for optimizing adaptive therapies based on a broad range of stochastic cancer models.",
