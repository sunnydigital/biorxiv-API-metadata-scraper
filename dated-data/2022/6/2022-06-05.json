    "abstract": "The main regions of cell proliferation in plants are the root and shoot apical meristems during primary growth and the vascular cambia as lateral meristems during secondary thickening. A number of unique regulators have been described in each of these meristems, suggesting that these different meristems might have independently evolved dedicated transcriptional networks to balance cell proliferation. Here, we show that the basic Helix Loop Helix (bHLH) transcription factor complexes formed by TARGET OF MONOPTEROS5 (TMO5), LONESOME HIGHWAY (LHW) and their close homologs are broadly expressed throughout plant development and operate as general regulators of cell proliferation in all meristems. Yet, genetic and expression analyses indicate that these complexes have specific functions in distinct meristems mediated by heterodimer complex variations between members of the TMO5 and LHW subclades. We determine that this is primarily due to their expression domains limiting the possible combinations of heterodimer complexes within a certain meristem, and to a certain extent to the absence of some members in a given meristem. We further demonstrate target gene specificity for heterodimer complexes, suggesting that spatial differences in transcriptional responses through heterodimer diversification allow a common bHLH heterodimer complex module to contribute to the control of cell proliferation in multiple meristems.",

    "abstract": "Mutations provide variation for evolution to emerge. A quantitative analysis of how mutations arising in single individuals expand and possibly fixate in a population is essential for studying evolutionary processes. While it is intuitive to expect that a continuous influx of mutations will lead to a continuous flow of mutations fixating in a stable constant population, joint fixation of multiple mutations occur frequently in stochastic simulations even under neutral selection. We quantitatively measure and analyse the distribution of joint fixation events of neutral mutations in constant populations. We propose a new concept, the mutation \"waves\", where multiple mutations reach given frequencies simultaneously. We show that all but the lowest frequencies of the variant allele frequency are dominated by single mutation \"waves\" that approximately follow an exponential distribution both in their size and the time between two \"waves\". Consequently, large swaths of empty frequencies are observed in the variant allele frequency distributions, with a few frequencies having numbers of mutations far in excess of the expected average values. We further show that the discrete mutation waves average out to a continuous distribution named as the Wave Frequency Distribution (WFD), the shape of which is predictable based on few model parameters.",

    "abstract": "Plants have evolved signaling mechanisms that guide growth away from adverse environments that can cause yield losses. Root halotropism is a sodium-specific negative tropism that is crucial for surviving and thriving under high salinity. Although root halotropism was discovered some years ago, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we show that abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated root twisting determines halotropism in Arabidopsis. An ABA-activated SnRK2 protein kinase (SnRK2.6) phosphorylates the microtubule-associated protein SP2L at Ser406, which induces a change in the anisotropic cell expansion at the root transition zone that located between the apical meristem and basal elongation zone, and is required for root twisting during halotropsim. Salt stress triggers SP2L-mediated cortical microtubule reorientation in cells at the transition zone, which guides cellulose microfibril patterns. Our findings outline the cellular and molecular mechanisms of root halotropism and indicate that anisotropic cell expansion through MT-reorientation and microfibril deposition have a central role in mediating tropic responses.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have evolved different strategies to overcome their recognition by the host innate immune system. Addition of cap at their 5RNA ends is an efficient mechanism to ensure escape from detection by the innate immune system, but also to ensure the efficient synthesis of viral proteins. Rotavirus mRNAs contain a type 1 cap structure at their 5end that is added by the viral capping enzyme VP3. This is a multifunctional protein with all the enzymatic activities necessary to add the cap, and also functions as an antagonist of the OAS-RNase L pathway. Here, the relative abundance of capped and noncapped viral RNAs during the replication cycle of rotavirus was determined. We found that both classes of rotaviral +RNAs are encapsidated, and they were present in a 1:1 ratio in the mature infectious particles. The capping of viral +RNAs is dynamic since different ratios of capped and noncapped RNAs were detected at different times post infection. Similarly, when the relative amount of capped and uncapped viral +RNAs produced in an in vitro transcription system was determined, we found that the proportion was very similar to that in the mature viral particles and in infected cells, suggesting that the capping efficiency of VP3 both, in vivo and in vitro, might be close to 50%. Unexpectedly, when the effect of simultaneously knocking down the expression of VP3 and RNase L on the cap status of viral +RNAs was evaluated, we found that even though at late times post infection there was an increased proportion of capped viral RNAs in infected cells, the viral particles isolated from this condition contained an equal ratio of capped and noncapped viral RNA, suggesting that there might be a selective packaging of capped-noncapped RNAs.\n\nSIGNIFICANCERotaviruses have a genome composed of eleven segments of double stranded RNA. Whether all 5 ends of the positive sense genomic RNA contained in the mature viral particles are modified by a cap structure is unknown. In this work, using a direct quantitative assay we characterized the relative proportion of capped and noncapped viral RNA in rotavirus infected cells and in viral particles. We found that independently of the relative proportions of cap/noncapped RNA present in rotavirus infected cells, there is a similar proportion of these two kinds of 5-modified positive sense RNAs in the viral particles.",
