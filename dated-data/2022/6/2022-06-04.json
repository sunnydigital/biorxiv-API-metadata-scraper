    "abstract": "Methyl-CpG-binding-protein 2 (MeCP2) is a nuclear protein expressed in all cell types, especially neurons1. Mutations in the MECP2 gene cause Rett syndrome (RTT), an incurable neurological disorder that disproportionately affects young girls2. Strategies to restore MeCP2 expression phenotypically reverse RTT-like symptoms in male and female MeCP2-deficient mice3-5, suggesting that direct nuclear delivery of functional MeCP2 could restore MeCP2 activity. We report that ZF-tMeCP2, a conjugate of MeCP2({Delta}aa13-71, 313-484)6 and the cell-permeant mini-protein ZF5.37-11, both binds DNA in a methylation-dependent manner and reaches the nucleus of model cell lines intact at concentrations above 700 nM. When delivered to live cells, ZF-tMeCP2 engages the NCoR/SMRT co-repressor complex and selectively represses transcription from methylated promoters. Efficient nuclear delivery of ZF-tMeCP2 relies on a unique endosomal escape portal provided by HOPS-dependent endosomal fusion. The Tat conjugate of MeCP2 (Tat-tMeCP2), evaluated for comparison, is degraded within the nucleus, is not selective for methylated promoters, and trafficks in a HOPS-independent manner. These results support the feasibility of a HOPS-dependent portal for delivering functional macromolecules to the cell interior using the cell-penetrant mini-protein ZF5.3. Such a strategy could broaden the impact of multiple families of protein-derived therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Anti-tumor immune polarization is a key predictor of clinical outcomes to cancer therapy. An emerging concept influencing clinical outcome involves the spatial location of CD8+ T cells, within the tumor. Our earlier work demonstrated immunosuppressive effects of NOS2/ COX2 tumor expression. Here, we show that NOS2/COX2 levels influence the polarization and spatial location of lymphoid cells including CD8+ T cells. Importantly, elevated tumor NOS2/COX2 correlated with exclusion of CD8+ T cells from the tumor epithelium. In contrast, tumors expressing low NOS2/COX2 had increased CD8+ T cell penetration into the tumor epithelium. Consistent with a causative relationship between these observations, pharmacological inhibition of COX2 with indomethacin dramatically reduced tumor growth of the 4T1 model of TNBC in both WT and Nos2-/- mice. This regimen led to complete tumor regression in [~]20% of tumor-bearing Nos2-/- mice, and these animals were resistant to tumor rechallenge. Th1 cytokines were elevated in the blood of treated mice and intratumoral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were higher in mice that received indomethacin when compared to control untreated mice. Multiplex immunofluorescence imaging confirmed our phenotyping results and demonstrated that targeted Nos2/Cox2 blockade improved CD8+ T cell penetration into the 4T1 tumor core. These findings are consistent with our observations in low NOS2/COX2 expressing breast tumors` proving that COX2 activity is responsible for limiting the spatial distribution of effector T cells in TNBC. Together these results suggest that clinically available NSAIDs may provide a cost-effective, novel immunotherapeutic approach for treatment of aggressive tumors including triple negative breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Excitable cells can be stimulated or inhibited by optogenetics. Since optogenetic actuation regimes are often static, neurons and circuits can quickly adapt, allowing perturbation, but not true control. Hence, we established an optogenetic voltage-clamp (OVC). The voltage-indicator QuasAr2 provides information for fast, closed-loop optical feedback to the bidirectional optogenetic actuator BiPOLES. Voltage-dependent fluorescence is held within tight margins, thus clamping the cell to distinct potentials. We established the OVC in muscles and neurons of Caenorhabditis elegans, and transferred it to rat hippocampal neurons in slice culture. Fluorescence signals were calibrated to electrically measured potentials, and wavelengths to currents, enabling to determine optical I/V-relationships. The OVC reports on homeostatically altered cellular physiology in mutants and on Ca2+-channel properties, and can dynamically clamp spiking. Combining non-invasive imaging with control capabilities of electrophysiology, the OVC facilitates high-throughput, contact-less electrophysiology in individual cells and paves the way for true optogenetic control in behaving animals.",

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractAs people live longer, age-related diseases, like sarcopenia, will become a greater public health concern. We use the model organism C. elegans to better understand the molecular mechanisms behind muscle maintenance. Muscle function is dependent on having properly organized and functioning thick filaments, which are primarily composed of myosin. The myosin head requires the chaperone UNC-45 to initially fold it after translation and is likely used to re-fold back to functionality after thermal or chemical stress induced unfolding. We observe an early onset of sarcopeania when UNC-45 is perturbed during adulthood. We observe that during adult aging, there is a sequential decline of HSP-90, UNC-45, and then myosin. Myosin and UNC-45 protein decline are independent of steady state mRNA levels. Loss of UNC-45 is correlated with an increase in phosphorylation of the protein. By mass spectrometry, S111 was identified as being phosphorylated and this modification may affect binding to HSP-90. A longevity mutant with delayed onset of sarcopenia also shows a delay in the loss of HSP-90, UNC-45, and myosin. We also see a decrease in UNC-45 protein, but not transcript, in an hsp-90 loss of function mutant, suggesting a role for HSP-90 in stabilizing UNC-45. This leads us to propose the model that during aging, a loss of HSP-90 leads to UNC-45 being post translationally modified, such as phosphorylation, and degraded, which then leads to a loss of myosin, and thus muscle mass and function. A better understanding of how myosin and its chaperone proteins are regulated and affected by aging will lead to better preventative care and treatment of sarcopenia and, possibly, the age-related decline of heart muscle function.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/494828v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1040254org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@34f503org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c1cd67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1945cf9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In young adults, under normal conditions the UCS domain of UNC-45 (shown in green) is bound to the myosin head (in red) and the TPR domain (in yellow) is bound to HSP-90 (in purple). Under stress conditions, HSP-90 detaches from the TPR domain, causing a conformational change in UNC-45 that allows the Central domain (in blue) to bind to the myosin neck (in red) resulting in inhibition of the myosin power stroke while the UCS domain protects/re-folds the myosin head. HSP-90 can then rebind the TPR domain, causing the Central domain to release the myosin neck, allowing movement of the myosin motor. However, aged adults experience a loss of HSP-90 and UNC-45 (which has increased post translational modification with aging). The loss of the Myosin chaperones leads to increased aggregation and degradation of Myosin with age.This loss of Myosin at the thick filament results in decline in muscle mass and function, also known as sarcopenia. Note that only the myosin head and neck are shown for simplicity of illustration.",

    "abstract": "Electrical stimulation has emerged as a powerful and precise treatment in which to modulate aberrant neural activity patterns common in neural dysfunction and disease; however, the physiological process involved in microstimulation is poorly understood, particularly regarding the contributions of inhibitory neurons to shaping stimulation-evoked activity. To address this issue, we used 2-photon imaging of transgenic mice to measure the widespread responses of inhibitory and excitatory neurons to electrical stimulation through a chronically-implanted cortical microelectrode. We found that increasing stimulation amplitude both raised the fraction of neurons that responded to a stimulus and increased the distance at which inhibitory and excitatory neurons were significantly modulated by stimulation; however, the lateral spread of inhibitory activity preceded that of excitatory activity. By 50 {micro}A, a significantly larger fraction of inhibitory neurons vs. excitatory neurons were modulated by stimulation. Increasing amplitude also shifted the temporal response properties of the population -- towards longer-latency excitation close to the electrode tip and strong inhibition of more distant neurons. Animal behavior, specifically their locomotion patterns, strongly correlated with trial-to-trial variability in stimulation-evoked responses. We conclude that changing electrical stimulation amplitude can shift the balance of excitation to inhibition in the brain in a manner that interact with ongoing animal behavior.",

    "abstract": "Volumetric muscle loss (VML) is an acute trauma that results in persistent inflammation, supplantation of muscle tissue with fibrotic scarring, and decreased muscle function. The cell types, nature of cellular communication and tissue locations that drive the aberrant VML response have remained elusive. Herein, we used spatial transcriptomics integrated with single-cell RNA sequencing on mouse and canine models administered VML. We observed VML engenders a unique spatial pro-fibrotic pattern driven by crosstalk between macrophages and fibro-adipogenic progenitors that was conserved between murine and canine models albeit with varying kinetics. This program was observed to restrict muscle stem cell mediated repair and targeting this circuit in a murine model resulted in increased regeneration and reductions in inflammation and fibrosis. Collectively, these results enhance our understanding of the immune cell-progenitor cell-stem cell crosstalk that drives regenerative dysfunction and provides further insight into possible avenues for fibrotic therapy exploration.",

    "abstract": "The different adipose tissues can be distinguished according to their function. For example, white adipose tissue (WAT) stores energy in form of lipids, whereas brown adipose tissue (BAT) dissipates energy in the form of heat. These functional differences are represented in the respective adipocyte morphology: whereas white adipocytes contain large, unilocular lipid droplets, brown adipocytes contain smaller, multilocular lipid droplets. However, an automated, image-analysis pipeline to comprehensively analyze adipocytes in vitro in cell culture as well as ex vivo in tissue sections is missing. We here present AdipoQ, an open-source software implemented as ImageJ plugins that allows to analyze adipocytes in tissue sections and in vitro after histological and/or immunofluorescent labelling. AdipoQ is compatible with different imaging modalities and staining methods, allows batch processing of large datasets and simple post-hoc analysis, provides a broad band of parameters, and allows combining multiple fluorescent read-outs. Thereby, AdipoQ is of immediate use not only for basic research but also for clinical diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "To ensure successful offspring ploidy, vertebrate oocytes must halt the cell cycle in meiosis II until sperm entry. Emi2 is essential to keep oocytes arrested until fertilization. Yet, how this arrest is implemented exclusively in meiosis II and not prematurely in meiosis I remained enigmatic. Using mouse and frog oocytes, we show here that cyclin B3, an understudied B- type cyclin, is essential to keep Emi2 levels low in meiosis I. Direct phosphorylation of Emi2 at an evolutionarily highly conserved site by Cdk1/cyclin B3 targets Emi2 for degradation. In contrast, Cdk1/cyclin B1 is inefficient in Emi2 phosphorylation providing a molecular explanation for the requirement of different B-type cyclins for oocyte maturation. Cyclin B3 degradation at exit from meiosis I enables Emi2 accumulation and thus, timely arrest in meiosis II. Our findings illuminate the evolutionarily conserved mechanisms controlling oocyte arrest for fertilization at the correct cell cycle stage, essential for embryo viability.",
