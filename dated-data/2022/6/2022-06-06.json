    "abstract": "Small molecules are components of fungal extracellular vesicles (EVs), but their biological roles are only superficially known. NOP16 is a eukaryotic gene that is required for the activity of benzimidazoles against Cryptococcus deuterogattii. In this study, during the phenotypic characterization of C. deuterogattii mutants lacking NOP16 expression, we observed that this gene was required for EV production. Analysis of the small molecule composition of EVs produced by wild-type cells and two independent nop16{Delta} mutants revealed that the deletion of NOP16 resulted not only in a reduced number of EVs but also an altered small molecule composition. In a Galleria mellonella model of infection, the nop16{Delta} mutants were hypovirulent. The hypovirulent phenotype was reverted when EVs produced by wild-type cells, but not mutant EVs, were co-injected with the nop16{Delta} cells in G. mellonella. These results reveal a role for NOP16 in EV biogenesis and cargo, and also indicate that the composition of EVs is determinant for cryptococcal virulence.",

    "abstract": "PurposeElevated transforming growth factor beta2 (TGF{beta}2) levels in the aqueous humor have been linked to glaucomatous outflow tissue dysfunction. Potential mediators of dysfunction are the transcriptional co-activators, Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ binding motif (TAZ). However, the molecular underpinnings of YAP/TAZ modulation in Schlemms Canal (SC) cells under glaucomatous conditions are not well understood. Here, we investigate how TGF{beta}2 regulates YAP/TAZ activity in human SC (HSC) cells using biomimetic extracellular matrix (ECM) hydrogels, and examine whether pharmacologic YAP/TAZ inhibition would attenuate TGF{beta}2-induced HSC cell dysfunction.\n\nMethodsPrimary HSC cells were seeded atop photocrosslinked ECM hydrogels, made of collagen type I, elastin-like polypeptide and hyaluronic acid, or encapsulated within the hydrogels. HSC cells were induced with TGF{beta}2 in the absence or presence of concurrent actin destabilization or pharmacologic YAP/TAZ inhibition. Changes in actin cytoskeletal organization, YAP/TAZ activity, ECM production, phospho-myosin light chain levels, and hydrogel contraction were assessed.\n\nResultsTGF{beta}2 significantly increased YAP/TAZ nuclear localization in HSC cells, which was prevented by either filamentous (F)-actin relaxation or depolymerization. Pharmacologic YAP/TAZ inhibition using verteporfin without light stimulation decreased fibronectin expression and reduced actomyosin cytoskeletal rearrangement in HSC cells induced by TGF{beta}2. Similarly, verteporfin significantly attenuated TGF{beta}2-induced HSC cell-encapsulated hydrogel contraction.\n\nConclusionsOur data provide evidence for a pathologic role of aberrant YAP/TAZ signaling in HSC cells under simulated glaucomatous conditions, and suggest that pharmacologic YAP/TAZ inhibition has promising potential to improve outflow tissue dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Excessive vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) signaling induces vascular leakage and angiogenesis in diseases. VEGFR2 trafficking to the cell surface, mediated by kinesin-3 family protein KIF13B, is essential to respond to VEGF-A in inducing angiogenesis. However, the precise mechanism of how KIF13B regulates VEGF-induced signaling and endothelial permeability is unknown. Here we show that KIF13B-mediated recycling of internalized VEGFR2 through Rab11-positive recycling vesicle regulates VE-cadherin phosphorylation and endothelial permeability. Phosphorylated VEGFR2 at the cell-cell junction was internalized and associated with KIF13B in Rab5-positive early endosomes. KIF13B mediated VEGFR2 recycling through Rab11-positive recycling vesicle, and inhibition of this recycling attenuated phosphorylation of VEGFR2 at Y951, Src, and VE-cadherin at Y685, which are necessary for endothelial permeability. Failure of VEGFR2 trafficking to the cell surface induced accumulation and degradation of VEGFR2 in lysosomes. Furthermore, in the animal model of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), inhibition of KIF13B-mediated VEGFR2 trafficking also mitigated vascular leakage. Thus, the present results identify the fundamental role of VEGFR2 recycling to the cell surface in mediating vascular permeability, suggesting a promising strategy for mitigating vascular leakage associated with inflammatory diseases.",

Naturalised in New Zealand, monkeyflower, (Erythranthre gutatta), a clonally spreading herb of waterways and seepage areas native to the Western USA, shows marked variation in a range of vegetative, reproductive and inflorescence traits. We used two common gardens differing in elevation to explore the relative contribution of genetic versus plastic variation within nine traits among 34 monkeyflower clones from across the New Zealand South Island. We looked for evidence of clinal variation across elevation gradients and for home site advantage. We found both high genetic diversity and trait plasticity explain the observed variation, although less evidence for adaptive plasticity. Most genetic variation was observed in the lowland garden (9m a.s.l.), where the overall trend was for above ground dry weight to be lower, and horizontal shoot length greater, than at the montane garden (560m a.s.l). We found no evidence of local adaptation to any of the measured environmental variables. However, we observed a pattern of higher biomass and higher plasticity at lower versus higher elevations and in clones originating from lower elevation sites.",

    "abstract": "Speciation in the marine environment is challenged by the wide geographic distribution of many taxa and potential for high rates of gene flow through larval dispersal mechanisms. Depth has recently been proposed as a potential driver of ecological divergence in fishes and yet it is unclear how adaptation along these gradients shapes genomic divergence. The genus Sebastes contains numerous species pairs that are depth segregated and can provide a better understanding of the mode and tempo of genomic diversification. Here we present exome data on two species pairs of rockfishes that are depth segregated and have different degrees of divergence: S. chlorostictus-S. rosenblatti and S. crocotulus-S. miniatus. We were able to reliably identify  islands of divergence in the species pair with more recent divergence (S. chlorostictus-S. rosenblatti) and discovered a number of genes associated with neurosensory function, suggesting a role for this pathway in the early speciation process. We also reconstructed demographic histories of divergence and found the best supported model was isolation followed by asymmetric secondary contact for both species pairs. These results suggest past ecological/geographic isolation followed by asymmetric secondary contact of deep to shallow species. Our results provide another example of using rockfish as a model for studying speciation and support the role of depth as an important mechanism for diversification in the marine environment.",

A total of 356 PAR- binding proteins were identified. The PAR-binding PARylome suggests that PAR- binding regulates a variety of biological processes beyond well-characterized DNA damage signaling and DNA repair. Proteins that may be reprogrammed by PAR-binding include signaling molecules, transcription factors, nucleic acid binding proteins, calcium binding proteins, ligases, oxidoreductases, enzymes, transferases, hydrolases, and receptors.

    "abstract": "Bacterial Ribonucleoprotein bodies (BR-bodies) play an essential role in organizing RNA degradation via liquid-liquid phase separation in the cytoplasm of bacteria. BR-bodies mediate multi-step mRNA decay through the concerted activity of the endoribonuclease RNase E coupled with the 3-5 exonuclease Polynucleotide Phosphorylase (PNPase). Our past in vivo studies indicated that the loss of PNPase recruitment into BR-bodies led to a significant build-up of RNA decay intermediates in Caulobacter crescentus. We reconstituted RNase Es C-terminal domain together with PNPase to understand how RNase E biomolecular condensates can tailor the functions of PNPase. We found that PNPase catalytic activity is accelerated when colocalized with the RNase E biomolecular condensates. In contrast, disruption of the RNase E-PNPase protein-protein interaction led to a loss of PNPase recruitment into the BR-bodies and a loss of ribonuclease rate enhancement. We also found that BR-bodies could enhance the decay of select RNA substrates, as we observed a 3.4-fold enhancement of polyadenylic acid (poly(A)) degradation and no impact upon poly(U) degradation. Our investigation into the origins of the 3.4-fold rate enhancement for poly(A) decay indicates a combination of scaffolding and mass action effects impact due to the concentrated biomolecular condensate environment accelerating RNA decay. Consistent with our past in vivo work, these studies suggest BR-bodies are sites of accelerated RNA decay that can shape the available transcriptome.",

Frequent injections or infusions have been current standard of care. In this study, we have developed a long-term antibody biodegradable implant using a porous polycaprolactone (PCL) capsule. It released Bevacizumab (Bev) slowly for 8 months to date. The Bev release kinetics fit a drug release model with experimental data of the diffusion coefficient and partition coefficient through the polymer capsule. Since screening drug release profiles for the long-term (> 6 months) is time consuming, an accelerated degradation method was used after validating characteristics of the PCL capsule in natural and accelerated degradation conditions. The correlation of time period between the natural and the accelerated degradation was determined. Overall, the study suggests mAbs can be released from a porous PCL capsule without an effect of the polymer degradation over the long period (~ 6 months) and the long-term release kinetics can be determined by the accelerated degradation within 14 days.",

    "abstract": "A major challenge in zooarchaeology is to morphologically distinguish closely related species remains, especially using small bone fragments. Shotgun sequencing aDNA from archeological remains and comparative alignment to the candidate species reference genomes will only apply when reference nuclear genomes of comparable quality are available, and may still fail when coverages are low. Here, we propose an alternative method, MTaxi, that uses highly accessible mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to distinguish between pairs of closely related species from ancient DNA sequences. MTaxi utilises mtDNA transversion-type substitutions between pairs of candidate species, assigns reads to either species, and performs a binomial test to determine the sample taxon. We tested MTaxi on sheep/goat and horse/donkey data, between which zooarchaeological classification can be challenging in ways that epitomise our case. The method performed efficiently on simulated ancient genomes down to 0.5x mitochondrial coverage for both sheep/goat and horse/donkey, with no false positives. Trials on n=18 ancient sheep/goat samples and n=10 horse/donkey samples of known species identity with mtDNA coverages 0.1x - 12x also yielded 100% accuracy. Overall, MTaxi provides a straightforward approach to classify closely related species that are compelling to distinguish through zooarchaeological methods using low coverage aDNA data, especially when similar quality reference genomes are unavailable.

    "abstract": "During protein synthesis, the ribosome shifts along the messenger RNA (mRNA) by exactly three nucleotides for each amino acid added to the protein being translated. However, in special cases, the sequence of the mRNA somehow induces the ribosome to shift forward by either two or four nucleotides. This shifts the \"reading frame\" in which the mRNA is translated, and gives rise to an otherwise unexpected protein. Such \"programmed frameshifts\" are well-known in viruses, including coronavirus, and a few cases of programmed frameshifting are also known in cellular genes. However, there is no good way, either experimental or informatic, to identify novel cases of programmed frameshifting. Thus it is possible that substantial numbers of cellular proteins generated by programmed frameshifting in human and other organisms remain unknown. Here, we build on prior work observing that data from ribosome profiling can be analyzed for anomalies in mRNA reading frame periodicity to identify putative programmed frameshifts. We develop a statistical framework to identify all likely (even for very low frameshifting rates) frameshift positions in a genome. We also develop a frameshift simulator for ribosome profiling data to verify our algorithm. We show high sensitivity of prediction on the simulated data, retrieving 97.4% of the simulated frameshifts. Furthermore, our method found all three of the known yeast genes with programmed frameshifts. We list several hundred yeast genes that may contain +1 or -1 frameshifts. Our results suggest there could be a large number of un-annotated alternative proteins in the yeast genome generated by programmed frameshifting. This motivates further study and parallel investigations in the human genome.

Here we use two fluorescent techniques, Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) and Fluorescence Intensity Fluctuations (FIF) spectrometry, to investigate how mutations in the EphA2 transmembrane (TM) helix affect the association between full-length EphA2 molecules in the absence of ligand and in the presence of three ligands: ephrinA1-Fc, m-ephrinA1, and the YSA peptide. The EphA2 mutations we studied have been previously characterized in the context of the isolated EphA2 TM helix. Working with full-length EphA2, we observed modest effects of the mutations on receptor-receptor interaction. Our data do not support the currently accepted model of a switch between two discrete TM helix dimerization motifs corresponding to active or inactive receptor states. Instead, we propose that different dimeric/oligomeric arrangements of the EphA2 extracellular region couple to an ensemble of TM helix dimer interfaces. Plasticity in the arrangements of receptor tyrosine kinase TM helices in active dimers and oligomers may serve to facilitate the cross-phosphorylation of multiple tyrosines in different positions of the intracellular regions.",

    "abstract": "Illuminating interactions between proteins and small drug molecules is a longstanding challenge in the field of drug discovery. Despite the importance of understanding these interactions, most previous works are limited by hand-designed scoring functions and insufficient conformation sampling. The recently-proposed graph neural network-based methods provides alternatives to predict protein-ligand complex conformation in a one-shot manner. However, these methods neglect the geometric constraints of the complex structure and weaken the role of local functional regions. As a result, they might produce unreasonable conformations for challenging targets and generalize poorly to novel proteins. In this paper, we propose Trigonometry-Aware Neural networKs for binding structure prediction, TANKBind, that builds trigonometry constraint as a vigorous inductive bias into the model and explicitly attends to all possible binding sites for each protein by segmenting the whole protein into functional blocks. We construct novel contrastive losses with local region negative sampling to jointly optimize the binding interaction and affinity. Extensive experiments show substantial performance gains in comparison to state-of-the-art physics-based and deep learning-based methods on commonly-used benchmark datasets for both binding structure and affinity predictions with variant settings.",

    "abstract": "Motor behavior requires the balanced production and integration of a variety of neural cell types. Motor neurons are positioned in discrete locations in the ventral spinal cord, targeting specific muscles to drive locomotive contractions. Specialized spinal interneurons modulate and synchronize motor neuron activity to achieve coordinated motor output. Changes in the ratios of spinal interneurons could drastically alter motor output by tipping the balance of inhibition and excitation onto target motor neurons. Importantly, individuals with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and associated autism spectrum disorders often have significant motor challenges, including repetitive behaviors and epilepsy. FXS stems from the transcriptional silencing of the gene Fragile X Messenger Ribonucleoprotein 1 (FMR1), which encodes an RNA binding protein that is implicated in a multitude of crucial neurodevelopmental processes, including cell specification. We find that zebrafish fmr1 mutants generate surplus ventral lateral descending (VeLD) interneurons, an early-born cell derived from the pMN domain. These GABAergic interneurons are also associated with changes in synaptogenesis, as fmr1 mutants show increased early expression of the scaffold Gephyrin, but these postsynaptic sites fail to mature. Our work shows that Fmrp regulates the proportionate production of neurons that comprise early embryonic motor circuits. As VeLD interneurons are hypothesized to act as central pattern generators driving the earliest spontaneous movements, this imbalance could profoundly influence the formation and long-term function of motor circuits driving locomotion.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveIndependent of weight status, rapid weight gain has been associated with underlying brain structure variation in regions associated with food intake and impulsivity among pre-adolescents. Yet, we lack clarity on how developmental maturation coincides with rapid weight gain and weight stability.\n\nMethodsWe identified brain predictors of two-year rapid weight gain and its longitudinal effects on brain structure and impulsivity in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study(R). Youth were categorized as Healthy Weight/Weight Stable (WSHW, n=225) or Weight Gainers (WG, n=221, >38lbs); 63% of the WG group were healthy weight at 9-to-10-years-old.\n\nResultsA five-fold cross-validated logistic elastic-net regression revealed that rapid weight gain was associated with structural variation amongst 39 brain features at 9-to-10-years-old in regions involved with executive functioning, appetitive control, and reward sensitivity. Two years later, WG youth showed differences in change over time in several of these regions and performed worse on measures of impulsivity.\n\nConclusionsThese findings suggest that brain structure in pre-adolescence may predispose some to rapid weight gain and that weight gain itself may alter maturational brain change in regions important for food intake and impulsivity. Behavioral interventions that target inhibitory control may improve trajectories of brain maturation and facilitate healthier behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Animals are shaped through the movement of large cellular collectives. Such morphogenetic processes require cadherin-based cell adhesion to maintain tissue cohesion and planar cell polarity to coordinate movement. Despite a vast literature surrounding cadherin-based adhesion and planar cell polarity it is unclear how these molecular networks interface. Here we investigate the relationship between cadherins and planar cell polarity during gastrulation cell movements in Xenopus laevis. We first assessed the bulk cadherin localization and found that cadherins were enriched at a specific subset of morphogenetically active cell-cell junctions. We then found that disruption of planar cell polarity desynchronized temporal cadherin and actin dynamics. Next, using super-resolution time-lapse miscopy and quantitative image analysis we were able to measure the lifespan and size of individual cadherin clusters. Finally, we show that planar cell polarity not only controls the size of cadherin clusters but, more interestingly, regulates cluster stability. These results reveal an intriguing link between two essential cellular properties, adhesion and planar polarity, and provide insight into the molecular control of morphogenetic cell movements.\n\nHighlightsPlanar cell polarity is required for cadherin spatiotemporal dynamics.\n\nSuper-resolution imaging reveals the spatiotemporal patterns of cadherin clustering.\n\nCadherin cluster lifespan and size are highly heterogenous.\n\nPlanar cell polarity controls cadherin cluster stability and size.",

    "abstract": "AimDespite significant population declines and targeted EU regulations aimed at A. anguilla conservation, little attention has been given to their status at their easternmost range. This study applies wide scale integrated monitoring to uncover the present-day eel distribution in Cyprus inland freshwaters. These are subject to increasing pressures from water supply requirements and dam construction, as seen throughout the Mediterranean.\n\nLocationCyprus.\n\nMethodsWe applied environmental DNA metabarcoding of water samples to determine A. anguilla distribution in key freshwater catchments. In addition, we present this alongside ten years of electrofishing/netting data. Refuge traps were also deployed to establish the timing of glass eel recruitment. These outputs are used together, alongside knowledge of the overall fish community and barriers to connectivity, to provide eel conservation and policy insights.\n\nResultsWe confirm the presence of A. anguilla in Cyprus inland freshwaters, with recruitment occurring in March. Eel distribution is restricted to lower elevation areas, and is negatively associated with distance from coast and barriers to connectivity. Many barriers to connectivity are identified, though eels were detected in 2 reservoirs upstream of dams. The overall fish community varies between freshwater habitat types.\n\nMain ConclusionsEels are much more widespread in Cyprus than previously thought, yet mostly restricted to lowland intermittent systems. This makes for a case to reconsider the requirement for eel management plans. Environmental DNA based data collected in 2020 indicate that  present-day eel distribution is representative of 10-year survey trends. Suggesting that inland freshwaters may act as an unrealised refuge at A. anguillas easternmost range. Conservation efforts in Mediterranean freshwaters should focus on improving connectivity, therefore enabling eels to access inland perennial refugia. Thus, mitigating the impact of climate change and the growing number of fragmented artificially intermittent river systems.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants including the Delta and Omicron along with waning of vaccine-induced immunity over time contributed to increased rates of breakthrough infection specifically among healthcare workers (HCWs). SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance is an important tool for timely detection and characterization of circulating variants as well as monitoring the emergence of new strains. Our study is the first national SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance among HCWs in Lebanon. We collected 250 samples from five hospitals across Lebanon between December 2021 and January 2022. We extracted viral RNA and performed whole genome sequencing using the Illumina NextSeq 500 platform. A total of 133 (57.1%) samples belonging to the Omicron (BA.1.1) sub-lineage were identified, as well as 44 (18.9%) samples belonging to the BA.1 sub-lineage, 28 (12%) belonging to the BA.2 sub-lineage, and only 15 (6.6%) samples belonging to the Delta variant sub-lineage B.1.617.2. These results show that Lebanon followed the global trend in terms of circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants with Delta rapidly replaced by the Omicron variant. This study underscores the importance of continuous genomic surveillance programs in Lebanon for the timely detection and characterization of circulating variants. The latter is critical to guide public health policy making and to timely implement public health interventions.",

    "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, several SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOC) emerged, bringing with them varying degrees of health and socioeconomic burdens. In particular, the Omicron VOC displayed distinct features of increased transmissibility accompanied by anti-genic drift in the spike protein that partially circumvented the ability of pre-existing anti-body responses in the global population to neutralize the virus. However, T cell immunity has remained robust throughout all the different VOC transmission waves and has emerged as a critically important correlate of protection against SARS-CoV-2 and its VOCs, in both vaccinated and infected individuals. Therefore, as SARS-CoV-2 VOCs continue to evolve, it is crucial that we characterize the correlates of protection and the potential for immune escape for both B cell and T cell human immunity in the population. Generating the insights necessary to understand T cell immunity, experimentally, for the global human population is at present critical but a time consuming, expensive, and laborious process. Further, it is not feasible to generate global or universal insights into T cell immunity in an actionable time frame for potential future emerging VOCs. However, using computational means we can expedite and provide early insights into the correlates of T cell protection. In this study, we generated and reveal insights on the T cell epitope landscape for the five main SARS-CoV-2 VOCs observed to date. We demonstrated here using a unique AI prediction platform, a strong concordance in global T cell protection across all mutated peptides for each VOC. This was modeled using the most frequent HLA alleles in the human population and covers the most common HLA haplotypes in the human population. The AI resource generated through this computational study and associated insights may guide the development of T cell vaccines and diagnostics that are even more robust against current and future VOCs, and their emerging subvariants.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus pandemic, whose first outbreak was reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China (COVID-19), is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Tissue damage caused by the virus leads to a strong immune response and activation of antigen-presenting cells, which can elicit acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) characterized by the rapid onset of widespread inflammation, the so-called cytokine storm. In many viral infections the recruitment of monocytes into the lung and their differentiation to dendritic cells (DCs) are seen as a response to the viral infection. DCs are critical players in the development of the acute lung inflammation that causes ARDS. Here we focus on the interaction of the ORF8 protein, a specific SARS-CoV-2 open reading frame protein, with dendritic cells (DCs). We show that ORF8 binds to dendritic cells, causes a pre-maturation of differentiating DCs, and induces the secretion of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines by these cells. In addition, we identified dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) as a possible interaction partner of ORF8 on dendritic cells. Blockade of ORF8 signaling leads to reduced production of IL-1{beta}, IL-6, IL-12p70, TNF-, MCP-1 (CCL2), and IL-10 by dendritic cells. Analysis of patient sera with high anti-ORF8 antibody titers showed that there was nearly no neutralization of the ORF8 protein and its function. Therefore, a neutralizing antibody that has the capacity of blocking the cytokine and chemokine response mediated by ORF8 protein might be an essential and novel additional step in the therapy of severe SARS-CoV-2 cases.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may keep patients in a clinically asymptomatic state by blocking cellular innate antiviral immunity, but the molecular mechanism remains unclear. Here, we screened the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and found that the spike (S) protein inhibits the activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and even reduces the expression of these genes to below background values. Mechanistically, the S protein interacted with STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 and impedes the phosphorylation of STAT1/STAT2, thus preventing the formation of the interferon-stimulating gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex and inhibiting the downstream production of Interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Remarkably, we also have found that the inhibitory mechanism of the S protein was conservative among SARS-CoV-2 variants and other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1. Truncation studies indicated that the most conserved S2 domain played a major inhibitory role. Altogether, our findings unveil a new mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 S protein attenuated the hosts antiviral immune response and provide new insights into the pathogenic mechanism of coronavirus.",
