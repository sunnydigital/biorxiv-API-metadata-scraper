    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a highly desmoplastic, aggressive cancer that frequently progresses by liver metastasis1. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF), extracellular matrix (ECM), and type I collagen (Col I) support2-5 or restrain PDAC progression and may impede blood supply and nutrient availability6-8. The dichotomous role of the stroma in PDAC, and the mechanisms through which it influences patient survival and enables desmoplastic cancers escape nutrient limitation remain poorly understood. Here we show that matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-cleaved or intact Col I (cCol I and iCol I, respectively) exert opposing effects on PDAC bioenergetics, macropinocytosis (MP), tumor growth and liver metastasis. While cCol I activates DDR1 (discoidin domain receptor-1)-NF-{kappa}B-p62-NRF2 signaling to promote PDAC growth, iCol I triggers DDR1 degradation and restrains PDAC growth. Patients whose tumors are enriched in iCol I and low in DDR1 and NRF2 have improved median survival compared to those enriched in cCol I, DDR1 and NRF2. Inhibition of DDR1-stimulated NF-{kappa}B or mitochondrial biogenesis blocked tumorigenesis in wildtype mice but not in mice expressing MMP-resistant Col I. In summary, the diverse effects of tumor stroma on PDAC growth, metastasis, and patient survival are mediated through the Col I-DDR1-NF-{kappa}B-NRF2-mitochondrial biogenesis pathway, presenting multiple new opportunities for PDAC therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTerahertz (THz) radiation is a valuable imaging and sensing tool which is widely used in industry and medicine. However, it biological effects including genotoxicity and cytotoxicity are not clear, particularly on the nervous system. In this study, we investigated how THz radiation with different frequency and intensity would affect the morphology, cell growth and function of rat hippocampal neurons in vitro.\n\nMethodsPrimary hippocampal neuronal cells were isolated from newborn Wistar rat pups and were exposed to THz radiation with the frequencies of 0.12 THz and 0.141 THz, at an power intensities of 10 mW/cm2 and 30 mW/cm2 respectively. The cellular activities were evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 after exposure for 10 min and 30 min. The cellular apoptosis was examined by Annexin V staining using flow cytometry and the ultrastructure was detected by electron microscopy. Moreover, the amount of amino acid in the cultured neurons was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).\n\nResultsNo obvious morphological changes, such as axon length and axon number, could be detected in primary neurons after exposure to 10mW/cm2 or 50 mW/cm2 THz for 30 min. However, the overall cellular activities were differentially affected by 10mW/cm2 and 50 mW/cm2 THz. Obvious cellular apoptosis was induced by both 10mW/cm2 and 50 mW/cm2 exposure. We also found that the amounts of most amino acids did not change significantly after exposure to these two types of THz radiation.\n\nConclusionsThe effects of THz radiation on hippocampal neurons depend on frequency, power, exposure time as well as the measurement time after the exposure. These results will provide important information for further investigation of the effect of THz radiation on the nervous system.",

    "abstract": "Parkinsons Disease is characterized by hallmark motor symptoms including resting tremor, akinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. In patient surveys of Parkinsons Disease symptoms and quality of life, tremor consistently ranks among the top concerns of patients with disease. However, the gold standard of treatment, levodopa, has inconsistent or incomplete anti-tremor effects in patients, necessitating new therapeutic strategies to help relieve this burden. Non-selective anti-muscarinic acetylcholine receptor therapeutic agents which target each of the 5 muscarinic receptor subtypes have been used as an adjunct therapy in this disease, as well as other movement disorders, and have been shown to have anti-tremor efficacy. Despite this, anti-muscarinic therapy is poorly tolerated due to adverse effects. Recent pharmacological advances have led to the discovery of muscarinic subtype selective antagonists that may keep the anti-tremor efficacy of non-selective compounds, while reducing or eliminating adverse effects. Here, we directly test this hypothesis using pharmacological models of parkinsonian tremor combined with recently discovered selective positive allosteric modulators and antagonists of the predominant brain expressed muscarinic receptors M1, M4, and M5. Surprisingly, we find that selective modulation of M1, M4, or M5 does not reduce tremor in these pre-clinical models, suggesting that central or peripheral M2 or M3 receptors may be responsible for the anti-tremor efficacy of non-selective anti-muscarinic therapies currently used in the clinic.",

    "abstract": "Viruses have evolved diverse mechanisms to antagonize host immunity such as direct inhibition and relocalization of cellular APOBEC3B (A3B) by the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) of Epstein-Barr virus. Here, we investigate the mechanistic conservation and evolutionary origin of this innate immune counteraction strategy. First, we find that human gamma-herpesvirus RNRs engage A3B via largely distinct surfaces. Second, we show that RNR-mediated enzymatic inhibition and relocalization of A3B depend upon binding to different regions of the catalytic domain. Third, we show that the capability of viral RNRs to antagonize A3B is conserved among gamma-herpesviruses that infect humans and Old World monkeys that encode this enzyme but absent in homologous viruses that infect New World monkeys that naturally lack the A3B gene. Finally, we reconstruct the ancestral primate A3B protein and demonstrate that it is active and similarly engaged by the RNRs from viruses that infect humans and Old World monkeys but not by the RNRs from viruses that infect New World monkeys. These results combine to indicate that the birth of A3B at a critical branchpoint in primate evolution may have been a driving force in selecting for an ancestral gamma-herpesvirus with an expanded RNR functionality through counteraction of this antiviral enzyme.",

    "abstract": "Slowing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 requires rapid and accurate diagnostic testing. Toward this end, loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), an isothermal genomic detection method, offers great promise but the readout tends to be difficult because it does not generate linear DNA products. Rapid antigen tests are coupled to lateral flow strips, with one (negative) or two (positive) bands providing simple rapid readout, but are less sensitive than genomic amplification methods. To address the need for a genomic amplification method that can be visualized on a lateral flow strip, we developed a novel strand-displacement probe. In this work we validate this pipeline for purified RNA, intact virus, and even virus deposited onto a surface. We demonstrate robust sensitivity (100 genomic copies) and and we demonstrate the utility of our assay as a surveillance system, with the capability to detect viral particles from surfaces, even after a week of complete dry-down. Our innovation couples the diagnostic advantages of a nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) with the simplicity of lateral-flow readouts.",

    "abstract": "DEL-1 (developmental endothelial locus-1) induces integrin signaling and recognizes phosphatidylserine exposed on apoptotic cells. We show that DEL-1, which is thought to be a secreted molecule, is not found in melanoma cell culture supernatants but is exported by an endosomal pathway and released via small extracellular vesicles (sEV). Proteomics of DEL-1 positive sEV, but not of DEL-1 negative sEV contain proteins associated with poor survival in cancer. To determine whether DEL-1 is suitable to predict treatment responses, we isolated sEV from plasma of melanoma patients before and 90 days of treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. Although we could not detect DEL-1 in plasma sEV even in patients with progressive disease (most likely due to the very low protein yield from sEV isolated from 1ml plasma), the principal component analysis allowed a clear differentiation between controls and patients as well as between patients before and after treatment. Interestingly, in one patient with complete regression, in the post treatment sample, the protein expression profile remained in the pre-treatment cluster. The low protein yield of patient sEV and the low patient number are clear limitations of this study, but results demonstrate that this method could have the potential to predict treatment responses.",
