    "abstract": "One of the extraordinary characteristics of the biological brain is its low energy expense to implement a variety of biological functions and intelligence compared to the modern artificial intelligence (AI). Spike-based energy-efficient temporal codes have long been suggested as the contributor for the brain to run with a low energy expense. Despite this code having been largely reported in the sensory cortex, whether this code can be implemented in other brain areas to serve broader functions and how the brain learns to generate it have remained unaddressed. In this study, we designed a novel brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm, by learning which two macaques could volitionally generate reproducible energy-efficient temporal patterns in the primary motor cortex (M1). Moreover, most neurons that were not directly assigned for controlling the BMI did not boost their excitability, demonstrating an overall energy-efficiency manner in performing the task. Over the course of learning, we found that the firing rates and temporal precision of selected neurons co-evolved to generate the energy-efficient temporal patterns, suggesting a cohesive rather than dissociable processing underlie the refinement of energy-efficient temporal patterns.",

    "abstract": "Sleep spindles are associated with the beginning of deep sleep and memory consolidation and are disrupted in schizophrenia and autism. In primates, distinct core and matrix thalamocortical (TC) circuits regulate sleep-spindle activity, through communications that are filtered by the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) however, little is known about typical TC network interactions and the mechanisms that are disrupted in brain disorders. We developed a primate-specific, circuit-based TC computational model with distinct core and matrix loops that can simulate sleep spindles. We implemented novel multilevel cortical and thalamic mixing, and included local thalamic inhibitory interneurons, and direct layer 5 projections of variable density to TRN and thalamus to investigate the functional consequences of different ratios of core and matrix node connectivity contribution to spindle dynamics. Our simulations showed that spindle power in primates can be modulated based on the level of cortical feedback, thalamic inhibition, and engagement of model core vs. matrix, with the latter having a greater role in spindle dynamics. The study of the distinct spatial and temporal dynamics of core-, matrix-, and mix-generated sleep spindles establishes a framework to study disruption of TC circuit balance underlying deficits in sleep and attentional gating seen in autism and schizophrenia.",

Here, the modulating effects of LHb activity on the association of a conditioned stimulus (CS) with the nonoccurrence of an unconditioned stimulus (US) were assessed in vivo using chemogenetic methods. Animals initially received explicitly unpaired CS light and US food presentations. Animals subjected to a retardation-of-acquisition task subsequently underwent light and food pairings, whereas those subjected to a summation task underwent compound light-tone and food pairings. The inhibitory light strength was assessed based on retardation of the acquisition of food-cup conditioned responses (CRs) in light-food pairings and comparisons of food-cup CRs to each stimulus in a CS-alone test following compound training. Neurotoxic LHb lesions and chemogenetic LHb inhibition throughout unpaired training attenuated the inhibitory light strength. Furthermore, chemogenetic LHb activation accelerated the decline in CR induced by repeated light-alone presentations following light-food pairings. Therefore, the LHb critically contributes to conditioned inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Axonal degeneration is a central pathological feature of neurodegenerative pathologies and is closely associated with irreversible clinical disability. Current noninvasive methods to detect axonal damage in vivo are limited in their specificity, clinical applicability, and lack of proper validation. We aimed to validate an MRI framework based on multicompartment modeling of the diffusion-weighted signal (AxCaliber) in rats in the presence of axonal pathology, achieved through injection of a neurotoxin damaging the neuronal terminal of axons. We then applied the same MRI protocol to map axonal integrity in the whole brain of multiple sclerosis relapsing-remitting patients and age-matched healthy controls, a pathology associated with a neurodegenerative component.\n\nAxCaliber is sensitive to microstructural axonal damage in rats, as demonstrated by a significant increase in the mean axonal caliber along the target tract, which correlated with the neurotoxin neurofilament staining. In humans, we uncovered a diffuse increase in mean axonal caliber in multiple sclerosis lesions and, importantly, in most areas of the normal-appearing white matter. Our results demonstrate that axonal diameter mapping is a sensitive and specific imaging biomarker able to link noninvasive imaging contrasts with the underlying biological substrate, supporting the key role of generalized axonal damage useful in diseases such as multiple sclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Sensorimotor performance after stroke is strongly related to focal injury measures such as corticospinal tract lesion load. However, the role of global brain health is less clear. Here, we examined the impact of brain age, a measure of neurobiological aging derived from whole brain structural neuroimaging, on sensorimotor outcomes. We hypothesized that stroke lesion damage would result in older brain age, which would in turn be associated with poorer sensorimotor outcomes. We also expected that brain age would mediate the impact of lesion damage on sensorimotor outcomes and that these relationships would be driven by post-stroke secondary atrophy (e.g., strongest in the ipsilesional hemisphere in chronic stroke). We further hypothesized that structural brain resilience, which we define in the context of stroke as the brains ability to maintain its global integrity despite focal lesion damage, would differentiate people with better versus worse outcomes.\n\nWe analyzed cross-sectional high-resolution brain MRI and outcomes data from 963 people with stroke from 38 cohorts worldwide using robust linear mixed-effects regressions to examine the relationship between sensorimotor behavior, lesion damage, and brain age. We used a mediation analysis to examine whether brain age mediates the impact of lesion damage on stroke outcomes and if associations are driven by ipsilesional measures in chronic ([&ge;]180 days) stroke. We assessed the impact of brain resilience on sensorimotor outcome using logistic regression with propensity score matching on lesion damage.\n\nStroke lesion damage was associated with older brain age, which in turn was associated with poorer sensorimotor outcomes. Brain age mediated the impact of corticospinal tract lesion load on sensorimotor outcomes most strongly in the ipsilesional hemisphere in chronic stroke. Greater brain resilience, as indexed by younger brain age, explained why people have better versus worse sensorimotor outcomes when lesion damage was fixed.\n\nWe present novel evidence that global brain health is associated with superior post-stroke sensorimotor outcomes and modifies the impact of focal damage. This relationship appears to be due to post-stroke secondary degeneration. Brain resilience provides insight into why some people have better outcomes after stroke, despite similar amounts of focal injury. Inclusion of imaging-based assessments of global brain health may improve prediction of post-stroke sensorimotor outcomes compared to focal injury measures alone. This investigation is important because it introduces the potential to apply novel therapeutic interventions to prevent or slow brain aging from other fields (e.g., Alzheimers disease) to stroke.",

    "abstract": "Models based on normative principles have played a major role in our understanding of how the brain forms decisions. However, these models have typically been derived for simple, stable environments, and their relevance to decisions under more naturalistic, dynamic conditions is unclear. We previously derived a normative decision model in which evidence accumulation is adapted to environmental dynamics (Glaze et al., 2015), but the evolution of commitment rules (e.g., thresholds on the accumulated evidence) under such dynamic conditions is not fully understood. Here we derive a normative model for decisions based on changing evidence or reward. In these cases, performance (reward rate) is maximized using adaptive decision thresholds that best account for diverse environmental changes, in contrast to predictions of many previous decision models. These adaptive thresholds exhibit several distinct temporal motifs that depend on the specific, predicted and experienced changes in task conditions. These adaptive decision strategies perform robustly even when implemented imperfectly (noisily) and can account for observed response times on a task with time-varying evidence better than commonly used constant-threshold or urgency-gating models. These results further link normative and neural decision-making while expanding our view of both as dynamic, adaptive processes that update and use expectations to govern both deliberation and commitment.",

    "abstract": "Cell division is essential for growth and development and involves events such as spindle assembly, chromosome separation, and cell plate formation. In plants, the tools used to control these events at the desired time are still poor because the genetic approach is ineffective owing to a high redundancy and lethality, as well as harmful side effects. Accordingly, we screened cell division-affecting compounds, with a focus on Arabidopsis thaliana zygotes, which individually develop in maternal ovules; the cell division was reliably traceable without time-lapse observations. We then identified the target events of the identified compounds using tobacco BY-2 cells for live-cell imaging and proteomics. As a result, we isolated two compounds, PD-180970 and PP2. PD-180970 disrupts microtubule (MT) organization and, thus, nuclear separation, presumably by inhibiting MT-associated proteins (MAP70). PP2 affected class II Kinesin-12 localization at the phragmoplast emerging site and impaired cytokinesis. Moreover, neither chemical caused irreversible damage to viability but they were effective in multiple plant species such as cucumber (Cucumis sativus) and moss (Physcomitrium patens). We propose that the combination of chemical screening based on Arabidopsis zygotes and target event specification focusing on tobacco BY-2 cells can be used to effectively identify novel tools and transiently control specific cell division events that are conserved in diverse plant species.",

    "abstract": "The oral microbiome is second only to its intestinal counterpart in diversity and abundance, but its effects on taste cells remains largely unexplored. Using single cell RNASeq, we found that mouse taste receptor cells (STRCs) have a gene expression signature reminiscent of Microfold (M) cells, a central player in immune surveillance in the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) such as those in the Peyers patch and tonsils. Administration of Tumor Necrosis Factor Ligand Superfamily Member 11 (TNFSF11, also known as RANKL), a growth factor required for differentiation of M cells dramatically increased M cell proliferation and marker gene expression in the taste papillae and in cultured taste organoids from wild type (WT) mice. Taste papillae and organoids from knockout mice lacking Spib (SpibKO), a RANKL-regulated transcription factor required for M cell development and regeneration on the other hand, failed to respond to RANKL. Taste papillae from SpibKO mice also showed reduced expression of NF-{kappa}B signaling pathway components and proinflammatory cytokines and attracted fewer immune cells. However, lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of cytokines was strongly upregulated in SpibKO mice compared to their WT counterparts. Like M cells, STRCs from WT but not SpibKO mice readily took up fluorescently labeled microbeads, a proxy for microbial transcytosis. The proportion of STRCs and other taste cell subtypes are unaltered in SpibKO mice; however, they displayed increased attraction to sweet and umami taste stimuli. We propose that STRCs are involved in immune surveillance at the taste papillae and tune their taste responses to microbial signaling and infection.",

    "abstract": "Memory traces develop gradually and link to neural plasticity. Memory reactivation during sleep is crucial for consolidation, but its precise impact on plasticity and contribution to long-term memory storage remains unclear. We used multimodal diffusion-weighted imaging to track the location and timescale of microstructural changes following Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR) of a motor task. This showed continuous microstructure plasticity in precuneus across 10 days post-TMR, paralleling the gradual development of behavioural benefit. Both early (0 - 24 h post-TMR) and late (24 h - 10 days post-TMR) microstructural changes in striatum and sensorimotor cortex were associated with the emergence of behavioural effects of TMR at day 20. Furthermore, the baseline microstructural architecture of sensorimotor cortex predicted TMR susceptibility. These findings demonstrate that repeated reactivation of memory traces during sleep engenders microstructural plasticity which continues days after the stimulation night and is associated with the emergence of memory benefits at the behavioural level.",

    "abstract": "The issue of antibody cross-reactivity is of central importance in immunology, and not least in protective immunity to Plasmodium falciparum malaria, where key antigens show substantial allelic variation (polymorphism). However, serological analysis often does not allow the distinction between true cross-reactivity (one antibody recognizing multiple antigen variants) and apparent cross-reactivity (presence of multiple variant-specific antibodies), as it requires analysis at the single B-cell/monoclonal antibody level. ELISpot is an assay that enables that, and a recently developed multiplexed variant of ELISpot (FluoroSpot) facilitates simultaneous assessment of B-cell/antibody reactivity to several different antigens. In this study, we present a further enhancement of this assay that makes direct analysis of monoclonal antibody-level cross-reactivity with allelic variants feasible. Using VAR2CSA-type PfEMP1 - a notoriously polymorphic antigen involved in the pathogenesis of placental malaria - as a model, we demonstrate the robustness of the assay and its applicability to analysis of true cross-reactivity of monoclonal VAR2CSA-specific antibodies in naturally exposed individuals. The assay is adaptable to the analysis of other polymorphic antigens, rendering it a powerful tool in studies of immunity to malaria and many other diseases.",

    "abstract": "The 2m-long human DNA is tightly intertwined into the cell nucleus of the size of 10m. The DNA packing is explained by folding of chromatin fiber. This folding leads to the formation of such hierarchical structures as: chromosomal territories, compartments; densely packed genomic regions known as Chromatin Contact Domains (CCDs), and loops. We propose models of dynamical genome folding into hierarchical components in human lymphoblastoid, stem cell, and fibroblast cell lines. Our models are based on explosive percolation theory. The chromosomes are modeled as graphs where CTCF chromatin loops are represented as edges. The folding trajectory is simulated by gradually introducing loops to the graph following various edge addition strategies that are based on topological network properties, chromatin loop frequencies, compartmentalization, or epigenomic features. Finally, we propose the genome folding model - a biophysical pseudo-time process guided by a single scalar order parameter. The parameter is calculated by Linear Discriminant Analysis. We simulate the loop formation by using Loop Extrusion Model (LEM) while adding them to the system. The chromatin phase separation, where fiber folds into topological domains and compartments, is observed when the critical number of contacts is reached. We also observe that 80% of the loops are needed for chromatin fiber to condense in 3D space, and this is constant through various cell lines. Overall, our in-silico model integrates the high-throughput 3D genome interaction experimental data with the novel theoretical concept of phase separation, which allows us to model event-based time dynamics of chromatin loop formation and folding trajectories.",

Constitutive heterochromatin is predominantly located within the B compartment and comprises chromatin that is in close contact with the nuclear lamina.3-5 By contrast, facultative heterochromatin marked by H3K27me3 can span both compartments.2-5 How epigenetic modifications, A/B compartmentalization, and lamina association collectively maintain heterochromatin architecture and function remains unclear.6,7 Here we developed an approach termed Lamina-Inducible Methylation and Hi-C (LIMe-Hi-C) that jointly measures chromosome conformation, DNA methylation, and nuclear lamina positioning. Through this approach, we identified topologically distinct A/B sub-compartments characterized by high levels of H3K27me3 and differing degrees of lamina association. To study the regulation of these sub-compartments, we inhibited Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), revealing that H3K27me3 is an essential factor in sub-compartment segregation. Unexpectedly, PRC2 inhibition also elicited broad gains in lamina association and constitutive heterochromatin spreading into H3K27me3-marked B sub-compartment regions. Consistent with repositioning to the lamina, genes originally marked with H3K27me3 in the B compartment, but not in the A compartment, remained largely repressed, suggesting that constitutive heterochromatin spreading can compensate for loss of H3K27me3 at a transcriptional level. These findings demonstrate that Polycomb sub-compartments and their antagonism with nuclear lamina association are fundamental organizational features of genome structure. More broadly, by jointly measuring nuclear position and Hi-C contacts, our study demonstrates how dynamic changes in compartmentalization and nuclear lamina association represent distinct but interdependent modes of heterochromatin regulation.",

    "abstract": "Current evidence suggests that migratory animals extract map information from the geomagnetic field for true navigation. The sensory basis underlying this feat is elusive, but presumably involves magnetic particles. A common experimental manipulation procedure consists of pre-treating animals with a magnetic pulse. This aims at re-magnetising particles to alter the internal representation of the external field prior to a navigation task. While pulsing provoked deflected bearings in laboratory experiments, analogous studies with free-flying songbirds yielded inconsistent results. Here, we pulsed European robins (Erithacus rubecula), being medium-distance migrants, at an offshore stopover site during spring migration and monitored their free-flight behaviour with a regional-scale tracking system. We found no pulse effect on departure probability, nocturnal departure timing, or departure direction, in agreement with results on a long-distance migrant released at the same site in autumn. This necessitates a reassessment of the importance of geomagnetic maps for migratory decisions for free-flying birds.\n\nSummary statementMagnetic pulse pre-treatment disturbs geomagnetic map usage of birds in lab environments. However, our free-flying birds show no effect, suggesting geomagnetic map information is less important in the natural environment.",

While the repeats themselves were far from sequence perfect they had notable conservation to a statistically significant level with three or more repetitions identified within one protein at a level that would be expected to randomly occur only once per 1031 residues. This sequence repeat was associated with a six stranded antiparallel {beta}-barrel module, two of which are present in the core of the structures of the PA clan of serine proteases, while a modified version of this module could be identified in the PDZ-like domains. Automated structural alignment methods had difficulties in superimposing these {beta}-barrels but use of a target human HtrA2 structure showed that these modules had an average RMSD across the set of structures of less than 2 [A] (mean and median). Our findings support Dayhoffs hypothesis that complex proteins arose through duplication of simpler peptide motifs and domains.",

    "abstract": "The vitamin A metabolite all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA; tretinoin) has anticancer potential. However, lack of clinical success has prevented its approval for solid tumours. Herein, we propose combining short-term low-dose ATRA preconditioning with fimaporfin-based photodynamic therapy (ATRA+PDT) for the improved treatment of solid cancers. Compared to monotherapies, ATRA+PDT induced synergistic cytotoxic responses including promotion of apoptosis in colon and breast carcinoma cell lines. Neither enhanced activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) nor increased expression of CD133 was detected after ATRA treatment indicating that ATRA+PDT cause cell death independent of differentiation. In the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line HT-29, the effect of ATRA+PDT on gene expression was evaluated by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We identified 1129 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after ATRA+PDT compared to PDT. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) predicted the unfolded protein response (UPR), interferon (IFN) signaling and retinoic acid-mediated apoptosis signaling as strongly activated canonical pathways after ATRA+PDT compared to PDT. A validation of the RNA-sec data by RT-qPCR revealed that ATRA+PDT elevated mRNA expression of early growth response 1 (EGR1) and strongly the stress-induced activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), of which was confirmed on the protein level. In addition, ATRA+PDT abolished mRNA expression of regenerating islet-derived protein 4 (REG4). During the first 20 days post-ATRA+PDT, we obtained significant anti-tumour responses in HT-29 xenografts, including complete responses in 2/5 mice. In conclusion, ATRA+PDT represent a novel combination therapy for solid tumours that should be further tested in immunocompetent preclinical models.",

An extensive yield-oriented breeding strategy has rendered Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) susceptible to many fungal pathogens however, Alternaria blight is one of the most pressing challenges of all because it causes almost 40-60% yield loss. Variable degree of tolerance is reported in wild relatives of B. juncea, Sinapis alba (White mustard) and camelina sativa (False flax) have been reported to exhibit moderate and high tolerance respectively against A. brassicae. Phytohormones are the essential regulator of the intricate mechanism of plant defence response. The hormones salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) have been widely studied and recognized as important regulators of plant immune response. In the last decade, research has pointed out that other hormones like abscisic acid (ABA) also participate equally in plant defence. However, the role of ABA in defence responses and its cross-talk with SA and JA has not been fully understood in terms of Brassica-A. brassicae system. In this investigation, three genotypes-B. juncea, S. alba and C. sativa were selected and their response to exogenous application of SA, JA and ABA and their combination with A. brassicae were studied. Disease assessment, gene expression analysis and quantitative estimation of phytohormones showed that the B. juncea exhibited a weak JA-mediated defence response against A. brassicae and synergy between SA-ABA shifted the signalling mechanism to SA-mediated response leading to susceptibility in B. juncea. Tolerant genotypes, S. alba and C. sativa exhibited a robust JA-mediated response against A. brassicae and JA-ABA was found antagonistic in Brassica-A. brassicae phyto-pathosystem.",

An unusual flexion in the scaffold enables folding of the complex, bringing the kinesin heavy chain-light chain interface into close apposition with a tetrameric assembly formed from the region of the molecule previously assumed to be the folding hinge.

SLs store cathepsin K and serve as a membrane precursor to the ruffled border, the osteoclasts  resorptive apparatus. Yet, the molecular composition and spatiotemporal organization of SLs remains incompletely understood. Here, using organelle-resolution proteomics, we identify member a2 of the solute carrier 37 family (Slc37a2) as a SL sugar transporter. We demonstrate that Slc37a2 localizes to the SL limiting membrane and that these organelles adopt a hitherto unnoticed but dynamic tubular network in living osteoclasts that is required for bone digestion. Accordingly, mice lacking Slc37a2 accrue high bone mass owing to uncoupled bone metabolism and disturbances in SL export of monosaccharide sugars, a prerequisite for SL delivery to the ruffled border. Thus, Slc37a2 is a physiological component of the osteoclasts unique secretory organelle and a potential therapeutic target for metabolic bone diseases.",

    "abstract": "The characterization of cortical myelination is essential for the study of structure-function relationships in the human brain. However, knowledge about cortical myelination is largely based on post mortem histology, which generally renders direct comparison to function impossible. The repeating pattern of pale-thin-pale-thick stripes of cytochrome oxidase (CO) activity in the primate secondary visual cortex (V2) is a prominent columnar system, in which histology also indicates different myelination of thin/thick versus pale stripes. We used quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at ultra-high field strength (7 T) to localize and study myelination of stripes in four human participants at sub-millimeter resolution in vivo. Thin and thick stripes were functionally localized by exploiting their sensitivity to color and binocular disparity, respectively. Resulting functional activation maps showed robust stripe patterns in V2 which enabled further comparison of quantitative relaxation parameters between stripe types. Thereby, we found lower longitudinal relaxation rates (R1) of thin and thick stripes compared to surrounding gray matter in the order of 1-2%, indicating higher myelination of pale stripes. No consistent differences were found for effective transverse relaxation rates [Formula]. The study demonstrates the feasibility to investigate structure-function relationships in living humans within one cortical area at the level of columnar systems using qMRI.",

    "abstract": "Event-related potentials (ERPs) and the oculomotor inhibition (OMI) in response to transient visual stimuli are known to be sensitive to different stimulus properties, including attention and expectation. In natural vision, transient stimulation of the visual cortex is generated primarily by saccades. Recent studies suggest that the core EEG components in free viewing, induced by saccades (fixation-related potentials, RPs), are similar to the ERP components with flashed stimuli. We have recently found that the OMI in response to flashed stimuli is sensitive to face familiarity. Here, we investigated whether fixation-related-potentials (FRPs) and microsaccade inhibition (OMI) in free viewing are sensitive to face familiarity. Observers (N=15) freely watched a slideshow of seven unfamiliar and one familiar world leaders facial images presented randomly for 4-seconds periods, with multiple images per identity. We measured the occipital fixation-related N1 relative to the P1 magnitude as well as the associated fixation-triggered OMI. We found that the average N1 was significantly smaller and the OMI was shorter for the familiar face, compared with any of the 7 unfamiliar faces. Moreover, the P1 was suppressed across saccades for the familiar but not for the unfamiliar faces. Overall, the results indicate that the occipital FRP and the OMI in free viewing are sensitive to face familiarity; this could perhaps be used as a novel physiological measure for studying hidden suppressed memories.",

It remains unclear how loss of brain pericytes in these conditions contributes to capillary dysfunction. Here, we conduct cause-and-effect studies by optically ablating pericytes in adult and aged mice in vivo. Focal pericyte loss induces capillary dilation without blood-brain barrier disruption. These abnormal dilations are exacerbated in the aged brain, and result in increased flow heterogeneity in capillary networks. A subset of affected capillaries experience reduced perfusion due to flow steal. Some capillaries stall in flow and regress, leading to loss of capillary connectivity. Remodeling of neighboring pericytes restores endothelial coverage and vascular tone within days. Pericyte remodeling is slower in the aged brain, resulting in regions of persistent capillary dilation. These findings link pericyte loss to disruption of capillary flow and structure. They also identify pericyte remodeling as a therapeutic target to preserve capillary flow dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Summary paragraphProgramming T lymphocytes to distinguish self from non-self is a vital, multi-step process arising in the thymus1-4. Signalling through the pre-T cell receptor (preTCR), a CD3-associated heterodimer comprising an invariant pT chain and a clone-specific {beta} chain, constitutes a critical early checkpoint in thymocyte development within the {beta} T-cell lineage5, 6. Recent work demonstrates that preTCRs arrayed on double negative (DN) thymocytes, like {beta} TCRs appearing on double positive (DP) thymocytes, ligate peptides bound to MHC molecules (pMHC) on thymic stroma but via a different molecular docking strategy7-10. Here we show the consequences of those distinctive interactions for thymocyte progression, using synchronized fetal thymic progenitor cultures differing in the presence or absence of pMHC on support stroma, determining single cell transcriptomes at key thymocyte developmental transitions. Although MHC negative stroma fosters {beta} T lymphocyte differentiation, the absence of pMHC-preTCR interplay leads to deviant thymocyte transcriptional programming associated with de-differentiation. Highly proliferative DN and DP subsets with antecedent characteristics of T cell lymphoblastic and myeloid malignancies emerge. Thus, at least in vitro, beyond fostering {beta} chain repertoire broadening for subsequent {beta} TCR utilization, preTCR-pMHC interaction limits cellular plasticity to facilitate normal thymocyte differentiation and proliferation that, if absent, introduces significant developmental vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "California operates a large forest carbon offsets program that credits carbon stored in forests across the continental United States and parts of coastal Alaska. These credits can be sold to buyers who wish to justify ongoing emissions, including in Californias cap-and-trade program. Although fossil CO2 emissions have effectively permanent atmospheric consequences, carbon stored in forests is inherently less durable because forests are subject to significant socioeconomic and physical risks that can cause temporarily stored carbon to be re-released into the atmosphere. To address these risks, Californias program is nominally designed to provide a 100-year guarantee on forest carbon claims based on a self-insurance program known as a buffer pool. Projects contribute credits to the buffer pool based on a suite of project-specific risk factors, with buffer pool credits retired as needed to cover carbon losses from events such as wildfire or drought. So long as the buffer pool remains solvent, the programs permanence claim remains intact. Here, we perform an actuarial analysis of the performance of Californias buffer pool. We document how wildfires have depleted nearly one-fifth of the total buffer pool in less than a decade, equivalent to at least 95 percent of the program-wide contribution intended to manage all fire risks for 100 years. We also show that potential carbon losses from a single forest disease, sudden oak death, could fully encumber all credits set aside for disease and insect risks. These findings indicate that Californias buffer pool is severely undercapitalized and therefore unlikely to be able to guarantee the environmental integrity of Californias forest offsets program for 100 years.",

Dramatic functional differences between embryos, larvae, juveniles and adults also concern sensory systems, including vision. Here we focus on the photoreceptors (rod and cone cells) in the retina and their gene expression profiles during the development. Using comparative transcriptomics on 63 species, belonging to 23 actinopterygian orders, we report general developmental patterns of opsin expression, mostly suggesting an increased importance of the rod opsin (RH1) gene and the long-wavelength sensitive (LWS) cone opsin, and a decreasing importance of the shorter wavelength sensitive cone opsin throughout development. Furthermore, we investigate in detail ontogenetic changes in 14 selected species (from Polypteriformes, Acipenseriformes, Cypriniformes, Aulopiformes and Cichliformes), and we report examples of expanded cone opsin repertoires, cone opsin switches (mostly within RH2) and increasing rod:cone ratio as evidenced by the opsin and phototransduction cascade genes. Our findings provide molecular support for developmental stage-specific visual palettes of ray-finned fishes and shifts between, which most likely arose in response to ecological, behavioural and physiological factors.",

    "abstract": "Accurate and comprehensive immunogenetic reference panels are key to the successful implementation of population-scale immunogenomics. The 5Mbp Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) is the most polymorphic region of the human genome and associated with multiple immune-mediated diseases, transplant matching and therapy responses. Analysis of MHC genetic variation is severely complicated by complex patterns of sequence variation, linkage disequilibrium and a lack of fully resolved MHC reference haplotypes, increasing the risk of spurious findings on analyzing this medically important region. Integrating Illumina and ultra-long Nanopore sequencing as well as bespoke bioinformatics, we completed five of the alternative MHC reference haplotypes of the current (B38) build of the human reference genome and added one other. The six assembled MHC haplotypes encompass the DR1 and DR4 haplotype structures in addition to the previously completed DR2 and DR3, as well as six distinct classes of the structurally variable C4 region. Analysis of the assembled haplotypes showed that MHC class II sequence structures, including repeat element positions, are generally conserved within the DR haplotype supergroups, and that sequence diversity peaks in three regions around HLA-A, HLA-B+C, and the HLA class II genes. Demonstrating the potential for improved short-read analysis, the number of proper read pairs recruited to the MHC was found to be increased by 0.32% - 0.69% in a 1000 Genomes Project read re-mapping experiment with seven diverse samples. Furthermore, the assembled haplotypes can serve as references for the community and provide the basis of a structurally accurate genotyping graph of the complete MHC region.",

    "abstract": "As the COVID-19 pathogen, SARS-CoV-2 relies on its main protease (MPro) for pathogenesis and replication. During the crystallographic analyses of MPro crystals that were exposed to the air, a uniquely Y-shaped, S-O-N-O-S-bridged posttranslational crosslink that connects three residues C22, C44, and K61 at their side chains was frequently observed. As a novel posttranslational modification, this crosslink serves as a redox switch to regulate the catalytic activity of MPro, a demonstrated drug target of COVID-19. The formation of this linkage leads to a much more opened active site that can be potentially targeted for the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 antivirals. The inactivation of MPro by this crosslink indicates that small molecules that lock MPro in the crosslinked form can be potentially used with other active site-targeting molecules such as paxlovid for synergistic effects in inhibiting the SARS-CoV-2 viral replication. Therefore, this new finding reveals a unique aspect of the SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and is potentially paradigm-shifting in our current understanding of the function of MPro and the development of its inhibitors as COVID-19 antivirals.",

For maintenance and function cilia are dependent on intraflagellar transport (IFT). Here we use a combination of microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy to study the response of phasmid chemosensory neurons, in live Caenorhabditis elegans, to chemical stimuli. We found that chemical stimulation resulted in unexpected changes in IFT and ciliary structure. Notably, stimulation with hyperosmotic solutions or chemical repellents resulted in different responses, not only in IFT, ciliary structure and cargo distribution, but also in neuronal activity. The response to chemical repellents results in habituation of the neuronal activity, suggesting that IFT plays a role in regulating the chemosensory response. Our findings show that cilia are able to sense and respond to different external cues in distinct ways, highlighting the flexible nature of cilia as sensing hubs.",

Using radioactive 11CO2 administered to single photosynthetically active source leaves, we examined the transport behavior and allocation patterns of 11C-photosynthates using gamma counting and autoradiography. Soil treated with liquid smoke caused significant reductions in phloem sectoriality involving young sink leaves and roots.

    "abstract": "Perception of speech requires sensitivity to features, such as amplitude and frequency modulations, that are often temporally regular. Previous work suggests age-related changes in neural responses to temporally regular features, but little work has focused on age differences for different types of modulations. We recorded magnetoencephalography in younger (21-33 years) and older adults (53-73 years) to investigate age differences in neural responses to slow (2-6 Hz sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal) modulations in amplitude, frequency, or combined amplitude and frequency. Audiometric pure-tone average thresholds were elevated in older compared to younger adults, indicating subclinical hearing impairment in the recruited older-adult sample. Neural responses to sound onset (independent of temporal modulations) were increased in magnitude in older compared to younger adults, suggesting hyperresponsivity and a loss of inhibition in the aged auditory system. Analyses of neural activity to modulations revealed greater neural synchronization with amplitude, frequency, and combined amplitude-frequency modulations for older compared to younger adults. This potentiated response generalized across different degrees of temporal regularity (sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal), although neural synchronization was generally lower for non-sinusoidal modulation. Despite greater synchronization, sustained neural activity was reduced in older compared to younger adults for sounds modulated both sinusoidally and non-sinusoidally in frequency. Our results suggest age differences in the sensitivity of the auditory system to features present in speech and other natural sounds.",

    "abstract": "Neural network models have been instrumental in revealing the foundational principles of whole-brain dynamics. Here we describe a new whole-cortex model of mouse resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) activity. Our model implements neural input-output nonlinearities and excitatory-inhibitory interactions within areas, as well as a directed connectome obtained with viral tracing to model interareal connections. Our model makes novel predictions about the dynamic organization of rsfMRI activity on a fast scale of seconds, and explains its relationship with the underlying axonal connectivity. Specifically, the simulated rsfMRI activity exhibits rich attractor dynamics, with multiple stationary and oscillatory attractors. Guided by these theoretical predictions, we find that empirical mouse rsfMRI time series exhibit analogous signatures of attractor dynamics, and that model attractors recapitulate the topographical organization and temporal structure of empirical rsfMRI co-activation patterns (CAPs). The richness and complexity of attractor dynamics, as well as its ability to explain CAPs, are lost when the directionality of underlying axonal connectivity is neglected. Finally, complexity of fast dynamics on the scale of seconds was maximal for the values of inter-hemispheric axonal connectivity strength and of inter-areal connectivity sparsity measured in real anatomical mouse data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFerroptosis is a form of regulated cell death characterised by lipid peroxidation as the terminal endpoint and a requirement for iron. Although it protects against cancer and infection, ferroptosis is also implicated in causing neuronal death in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). The precise role for ferroptosis in causing neuronal death is yet to be fully resolved.\n\nMethodsTo elucidate the role of ferroptosis in neuronal death we utilised co-culture and conditioned medium transfer experiments involving microglia, astrocytes and neurones. We ratified clinical significance of our cell culture findings via assessment of human CNS tissue from cases of the fatal, paralysing neurodegenerative condition of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Finally, we utilised the SOD1G37R mouse model of ALS and a novel CNS-permeant ferroptosis inhibitor to verify pharmacological significance in vivo.\n\nResultsWe found that sublethal ferroptotic stress selectively affecting microglia triggers an inflammatory cascade that results in non-cell autonomous neuronal death. Central to this cascade is the conversion of astrocytes to a neurotoxic state. We show that spinal cord tissue from cases of ALS exhibits a signature of ferroptosis that encompasses atomic, molecular and biochemical features. Moreover, a molecular correlation between ferroptosis and neurotoxic astrocytes evident in ALS-affected spinal cord is recapitulated in the SOD1G37R mouse model where treatment with the novel, CNS-permeant ferroptosis inhibitor, CuII(atsm), ameliorated these markers and was neuroprotective.\n\nConclusionsBy showing that microglia responding to sublethal ferroptotic stress culminates in non-cell autonomous neuronal death, our results implicate microglial ferroptotic stress as a rectifiable cause of neuronal death in neurodegenerative disease. As ferroptosis is currently primarily regarded as an intrinsic cell death phenomenon, these results introduce an entirely new pathophysiological role for ferroptosis in disease.",

Here, we measured CeA activity using the activity marker c-Fos and CeA reactivity using fiber photometry paired with an aversive air-puff stimulus. We found that psilocin administration acutely increased CeA activity in both males and females and increased stimulus specific CeA reactivity in females, but not males. In contrast, psilocin produced time-dependent decreases in reactivity in males, but not females as early as 2-days and lasting to 28-days post administration. We also measured behavioral responses to the air-puff stimulus and found sex-dependent changes in threat responding but not exploratory behavior or general locomotion. Repeated presentations of the auditory component of the air-puff were also performed and sex-specific effects of psilocin on CeA reactivity to the auditory-alone stimulus were also observed. This study provides new evidence that a single dose of psilocin produces sex-specific, time-dependent, and enduring changes in CeA reactivity and behavioral responding to specific components of an aversive stimulus.",

Because of their great diversity in terms of molecular signature, terminal endings morphology and electrophysiological properties, mirroring the complexity of tactile experience, LTMRs are a model of choice to study the molecular cues differentially controlling neuronal diversification. While the transcriptional codes that define different LTMR subtypes have been extensively studied, the molecular players that participate in their late maturation and in particular in the striking diversity of their end-organ morphological specialization are largely unknown. Here we identified the TALE homeodomain transcription factor Meis2 as a key regulator of LTMRs target-field innervation. Meis2 is specifically expressed in cutaneous LTMRs and its expression depends on target-derived signals. While LTMRs lacking Meis2 survived and are normally specified, their end-organ innervations, electrophysiological properties and transcriptome are differentially and markedly affected, resulting in impaired sensory-evoked behavioral responses. These data establish Meis2 as a major transcriptional regulator controlling the orderly formation of sensory neurons innervating peripheral end-organs required for light touch.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the prevalence and abundance of parasites over time is important for addressing their potential impact on host life-histories, immunological profiles, and their influence as a selective force. Only long-term ecological studies have the potential to shed light on both the temporal trends in infection prevalence and abundance and the drivers of such trends, because of their ability to dissect drivers that may be confounded over shorter time scales. Despite this, only a relatively small number of such studies exist. Here, we analysed changes in the prevalence and abundance of gastrointestinal parasites in the wild Soay sheep population of St Kilda across 31 years. The host population density has increased across the study, and population density is known to increase parasite transmission, but we found that density and year explained temporal variation in parasite prevalence and abundance independently. Prevalence of both strongyle nematodes and coccidian microparasites increased during the study, and this effect varied between lambs, yearlings and adults. Meanwhile, abundance of strongyles was more strongly linked to host density than to temporal (yearly) dynamics, while abundance of coccidia showed a strong temporal trend without any influence of density. Strikingly, coccidian abundance increased threefold across the course of the study in lambs, while increases in yearlings and adults were negligible. Our decades-long, intensive, individual-based study will enable the role of environmental change and selection pressures in driving these dynamics to be determined, potentially providing unparalleled insight into the drivers of temporal variation in parasite dynamics in the wild.\n\nKey findingsO_LIWe studied temporal trends in gastrointestinal parasites of wild sheep over 31 years\nC_LIO_LIYear and host population density explained temporal variation in parasites independently\nC_LIO_LIPrevalence of both strongyle nematodes and coccidia varied across the study period\nC_LIO_LIAbundance of strongyles was more closely linked to host density than year\nC_LIO_LIAbundance of coccidia increased threefold over time in lambs, but did not vary in adults\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genomic loci associated with complex traits, but it remains an open challenge to identify the genes underlying the association signals. Here, we extend the equations of statistical fine-mapping, to compute the probability that each gene in the human genome is targeted by a causal variant, given a particular trait. Our computations are enabled by several key innovations. First, we partition the genome into optimal linkage disequilibrium blocks, enabling genome-wide detection of trait-associated genes. Second, we unveil a comprehensive mapping that associates genetic variants to the target genes they affect. The combined performance of the map on high-throughput functional genomics and eQTL datasets supersedes the state of the art. Lastly, we describe an algorithm which learns, directly from GWAS data, how to incorporate prior knowledge into the statistical computations, significantly improving their accuracy. We validate each component of the statistical framework individually and in combination. Among methods to identify genes targeted by causal variants, this paradigm rediscovers an unprecedented proportion of known disease genes. Moreover, it establishes human genetics support for many genes previously implicated only by clinical or preclinical evidence, and it discovers an abundance of novel disease genes with compelling biological rationale.",

    "abstract": "Due to the global spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and the resultant pandemic, there has been a major surge in the demand for surgical masks, respirators, and other air filtration devices. Unfortunately, the fact that these filters are made of petrochemical-derived, non-biodegradable polymers means that the surge in production has also led to a surge in plastic waste. In this work, we present novel, sustainable filters based on bacterial cellulose (BC) functionalized with low-pressure argon plasma (LPP-Ar). The \"green\" production process involved BC biosynthesis by Komagataeibacter xylinus, followed by simple purification, homogenization, lyophilization, and finally LPP-Ar treatment. The obtained LPP-Ar-functionalized BC-based material (LPP-Ar-BC-bM) showed excellent antimicrobial and antiviral properties, with no cytotoxicity versus murine fibroblasts in vitro. Further, filters consisting of three layers of LPP-Ar-BC-bM had >99% bacterial and viral filtration efficiency, while maintaining sufficiently low airflow resistance (6 mbar at an airflow of 95 L/min). Finally, as a proof-of-concept, we were able to prepare 80 masks with LPP-Ar-BC-bM filter and ~85% of volunteer medical staff assessed them as good or very good in terms of comfort. We conclude that our novel sustainable, biobased, biodegradable filters are suitable for respiratory personal protective equipment (PPE), such as surgical masks and respirators. Further, with scale-up, they may be adapted for indoor air handling filtration in hospitals or schools.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=102 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/489859v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@99ae8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@192c4eforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bf2acborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@92907a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The HLA genotype affects the presentability of tumour antigens to the immune system. While knowledge of these genotypes is of utmost importance to study differences in immune responses between cancer patients, gold standard, PCR-derived genotypes are rarely available in large Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) datasets. Therefore, a variety of methods for in silico NGS-based HLA genotyping have been developed, bypassing the need to determine these genotypes with separate experiments. However, there is currently no consensus on the best performing tool. Here, we compiled a list of 13 HLA callers and evaluated their accuracy on three different datasets.

    "abstract": "P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is a prototypical ABC transporter of great biological and clinical significance that confers cancer multidrug resistance and mediates the bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of many drugs1-3. Decades of structural and biochemical studies have provided insights into how Pgp binds diverse compounds4-9, but how they are translocated through the membrane has remained elusive. Here, we covalently attached a cyclic substrate to discrete sites of Pgp and determined multiple complex structures in inward- and outward-facing states by cryoEM. In conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations, our structures trace the substrate passage across the membrane and identify conformational changes in transmembrane helix 1 (TM1) as regulators of substrate transport. In mid-transport conformations, TM1 breaks at glycine 72. Mutation of this residue significantly impairs drug transport of Pgp in vivo, corroborating the importance of its regulatory role. Importantly, our data suggest that the cyclic substrate can exit Pgp without the requirement of a wide-open outward-facing conformation, diverting from the common efflux model for Pgp and other ABC exporters. The substrate transport mechanism of Pgp revealed here pinpoints critical targets for future drug discovery studies of this medically relevant system.",

    "abstract": "Numerous applications of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) in basic biology and therapeutic development require efficient protein biosynthesis using an expanded genetic code. However, achieving such incorporation at repurposed stop codons in cells is generally inefficient and limited by complex cellular processes that preserve the fidelity of protein synthesis. A more comprehensive understanding of the processes that contribute to ncAA incorporation would aid in the development of genomic engineering strategies for augmenting genetic code manipulation. In this work, we screened a pooled Saccharomyces cerevisiae molecular barcoded yeast knockout (YKO) collection to identify single-gene knockout strains exhibiting improved ncAA incorporation efficiency in response to the amber (TAG) stop codon. We used a series of intracellular fluorescent reporters in tandem with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) to identify 55 unique candidate deletion strains. Identified genes encode for proteins that participate in diverse cellular processes; many of the genes have no known connection with protein translation. We then verified that two knockouts, yil014c-a{Delta} and alo1{Delta}, had improved incorporation efficiency using independently acquired strains possessing the knockouts. Characterizations of the activity of yil014c-a{Delta} and alo1{Delta} with additional orthogonal translation systems and ncAAs indicate that deletion of each of these genes enhances ncAA incorporation efficiency without loss of fidelity over a wide range of conditions. Our findings highlight opportunities for further modulating gene expression with genetic, genomic, and synthetic biology approaches to improve ncAA incorporation efficiency. In addition, these discoveries have the potential to enhance our fundamental understanding of protein translation. Ultimately, this study provides a foundation for future efforts to engineer cells to incorporate ncAA at greater efficiencies, which in turn will streamline the realization of applications utilizing expanded genetic codes ranging from basic biology to drug discovery.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Here, we show that ER stress activates JNK via IRE1 in fly and cellular models of C9orf72-mediated ALS/FTD (c9ALS/FTD), the most common genetic form of ALS/FTD. Furthermore, activated JNK promotes SG assembly induced by poly(GR) and poly(PR), two toxic proteins implicated in c9ALS/FTD, by promoting the transcription of G3BP1, a key SG protein. Consistent with these findings, JNK or IRE1 inhibition reduced SG formation, G3BP1 mRNA and protein levels, and neurotoxicity in cells overexpressing poly(GR) and poly(PR) or neurons derived from c9ALS/FTD patient induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Our findings connect ER stress, JNK, and SG assembly in a unified pathway contributing to c9ALS/FTD neurodegeneration.",

In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal features of ECAPs in and around the STN across parameter sweeps of stimulation current amplitude, pulse width, and electrode configuration, and used a linear classifier of ECAP responses to predict electrode location. Four non-human primates were implanted unilaterally with either a directional (n=3) or non-directional (n=1) DBS lead targeting the sensorimotor STN. ECAP responses were characterized by primary features (within 1.6 ms after a stimulus pulse) and secondary features (between 1.6-7.4 ms after a stimulus pulse). Using these ECAP features, a linear classifier was able to accurately differentiate electrodes within the STN versus dorsal to the STN in all four subjects. ECAP responses varied systematically with recording and stimulating electrode locations, which provides a subject-specific neuroanatomical basis for selecting electrode configurations in the treatment of Parkinsons disease with DBS therapy.",

According to the taxonomists of the last century, this species complex was supposed to be present in the whole Southern Limestone Alps of Italy as well as in peninsular Italy and Slovenia. Considering the large presumed distribution area, we tested the contrasting hypotheses of monophyly versus paraphyly of this subterranean species complex, taking in account the presence of putative cryptic species. For this reason, we sampled the type localities of all the described species in the complex present in the Italian Southern Limestone Alps and neighbouring areas, and used nuclear (28S, ITS region) and mtDNA (COI) sequences to assess their phylogenetic relationships and species richness. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed that the Niphargus stygius complex in the Southern Limestone Alps is not monophyletic but comprises an eastern clade (the N. kenki clade, present in NW Italy, northern Slovenia, and southern Austria) and two western clades (the N. brixianus and N. montellianus clades), _These two clades are not closely related to the eastern one but rather form a monophyletic group together with a widely distributed Apennine clade (N. speziae clade). None of these clades is closely related to typical N. stygius. Three different molecular species delimitation methods applied to COI and ITS recognized different number of putative species, richer for the COI marker, suggesting that each clade is a species complex in itself. Bayesian time-calibrated phylogeny revealed that most clades began to split up during Miocene and Pliocene, ruling out the effect of Pleistocene glaciations in explaining their evolutionary history and justifying the presence of several putative cryptic species.",

Current studies with functional connectivity and linear models are limited by low temporal resolution and insufficient model capacity. With a generative variational auto encoder (VAE), the present study mapped the high-dimensional transient co-activity patterns (CAPs) of functional magnetic resonance imaging data to a low-dimensional latent representation that followed a multivariate gaussian distribution. We demonstrated with multiple datasets that the VAE model could effectively represent the transient CAPs in the latent space. Transient CAPs from high-intensity and low-intensity values reflected the same functional structure of brain and could be reconstructed from the same distribution in the latent space. With the reconstructed latent time courses, preceding CAPs successful predicted the following transient CAP with a long short-term memory recurrent neural network. Our methods provide a new avenue to characterize the brains transient co-activity maps and model the complex dynamics between them in a framewise manner.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic taxonomic profiling aims to predict the identity and relative abundance of taxa in a given whole genome sequencing metagenomic sample. A recent surge in computational methods that aim to accurately estimate taxonomic profiles, called taxonomic profilers, have motivated community driven efforts to create standardized benchmarking datasets and platforms, standardized taxonomic profile formats, as well as a benchmarking platform to assess tool performance. While this standardization is essential, there is currently a lack of tools to visualize the standardized output of the many existing taxonomic profilers, and benchmarking studies rely on a single value metrics to compare performance of tools and compare to benchmarking datasets. Here we report the development of TAMPA (Taxonomic metagenome profiling evaluation), a robust and easy-to-use method that allows scientists to easily interpret and interact with taxonomic profiles produced by the many different taxonomic profiler methods beyond the standard metrics used by the scientific community. We demonstrate the unique ability of TAMPA to provide important biological insights into the taxonomic differences between samples otherwise missed by commonly utilized metrics. Additionally, we show that TAMPA can help visualize the output of taxonomic profilers, enabling biologists to effectively choose the most appropriate profiling method to use on their metagenomics data.

    "abstract": "TolC is the trimeric outer membrane component of the efflux pump system in E. coli responsible for antibiotic efflux from bacterial cells. Over-expression of efflux pumps has been reported to decrease susceptibility to antibiotics in a variety of bacterial pathogens. Reliable production of membrane proteins allows for the biophysical and structural characterization needed to better understand efflux and for the development of therapeutics. Preparation of recombinant protein for biochemical/structural studies often involves the production of proteins as inclusion body aggregates from which bioactive proteins are recovered. Here we find that the in vitro folding of TolC into its functional trimeric state from inclusion bodies is dependent on the headgroup composition of detergent micelles used. Nonionic detergent favors the formation of functional trimeric TolC, whereas zwitterionic detergents induce the formation of a non-native trimeric TolC fold. We also find that nonionic detergents with shorter alkyl lengths facilitate TolC folding. It remains to be seen whether the charges in lipid headgroups have similar effects on membrane insertion and folding in biological systems.",

    "abstract": "Aging is a carcinogen that markedly increases cancer risk, yet we have limited mechanistic understanding of cancer initiation in aged cells. Here, we demonstrate induction of the hallmark aging process cellular senescence, triggered by loss of Wnt inhibitor ZNRF3, remodels the tissue microenvironment and ultimately permits metastatic adrenal cancer. Detailed characterization reveals a striking sexual dimorphism. Males exhibit earlier senescence activation and a greater innate immune response. This results in high myeloid cell accumulation and lower incidence of malignancy. Conversely, females present a dampened immune response and are more prone to metastatic cancer. Senescence-recruited myeloid cells become increasingly depleted with advanced tumor progression, which is recapitulated in patients where a low myeloid signature is associated with worse outcome. Collectively, our study reveals a novel role for myeloid cells in restraining adrenal cancer progression with significant prognostic value, and provides a model for interrogating pleiotropic effects of cellular senescence in cancer.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=67 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/488426v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bddf22org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18434a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9bc772org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1430fbb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract created with BioRender.com\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "CLN3 disease is a lysosomal storage disorder associated with fatal neurodegeneration that is caused by mutations in CLN3. Most individuals with CLN3 disease carry at least one allele with a 966 bp deletion in CLN3 which results in the deletion of exons 7 and 8. There is a need for more physiologically relevant human cell-based CLN3 disease models to better understand the cellular changes during the disease process. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we corrected the 966 bp deletion mutation in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of a compound heterozygous patient (CLN3 {Delta} 966 bp and E295K). The isogenic deletion-corrected and unedited CLN3 patient iPSCs were used for disease modeling. iPSC-derived neurons carrying this particular CLN3 mutation (CLN3 neurons) had lower functional activity as recorded using microelectrode arrays for most of the culture period. Proteomics analysis showed downregulation of proteins related to axon guidance and endocytosis at day in vitro (DIV) 14 and 42 in CLN3 neurons. This was accompanied by an increase in lysosomal-related proteins in CLN3 neurons. Western blot analysis revealed hyperglycosylation of the lysosomal marker, Lysosome Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) in CLN3 neurons at DIV 14, 28 and 42, which was not apparent in control neurons. Ultrastructural analysis of CLN3 neurons showed numerous membrane-bound vacuoles containing diverse types of storage material, ranging from curvilinear deposits, multilamellar structures to osmiophilic deposits. Our findings suggest alterations in lysosomal function and neurodevelopment involving axon guidance and synaptic transmission in CLN3-deficient neuronal derivatives, which could be potential targets for therapy.",

    "abstract": "In the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic, considerable focus has been placed on a model of viral entry into host epithelial populations, with a separate focus upon the responding immune system dysfunction that exacerbates or causes disease. We developed a precision-cut lung slice model to investigate very early host-viral pathogenesis and found that SARS-CoV-2 had a rapid and specific tropism for myeloid populations in the human lung. Infection of alveolar macrophages was partially dependent upon their expression of ACE2, and the infections were productive for amplifying virus, both findings which were in contrast with their neutralization of another pandemic virus, Influenza A virus (IAV). Compared to IAV, SARS-CoV-2 was extremely poor at inducing interferon-stimulated genes in infected myeloid cells, providing a window of opportunity for modest titers to amplify within these cells. Endotracheal aspirate samples from humans with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) from COVID-19 confirmed the lung slice findings, revealing a persistent myeloid depot. In the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, myeloid cells may provide a safe harbor for the virus with minimal immune stimulatory cues being generated, resulting in effective viral colonization and quenching of the immune system.",

    "abstract": "Some species successfully repair retinal injuries in contrast to non-regenerative mammalian retina. We show here that the Mexican axolotl salamander regrows its excised retina even in adulthood. During early regeneration, cell proliferation occurred in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). All dividing cells expressed Vimentin, and some also expressed Muller glia and neural progenitor cell marker Glast (Slc1a3), suggesting that regeneration is driven by RPE-derived retinal progenitor cells. Bulk RNA sequencing showed that genes associated with the extracellular matrix and angiogenesis were upregulated in early-to-mid retinal regeneration. The fully regenerated retina re-established nerve projections to the brain and contained all the original retinal cell types, including Muller glia. Regeneration of cellular diversity may be modulated by Notch signaling, as inhibiting Notch signaling in early regeneration promoted production of rod photoreceptors. Our study highlights the axolotl salamander as an advantageous model of adult tetrapod retinal regeneration and provides insights into its mechanisms.\n\nSummaryWe demonstrate that adult Mexican axolotl salamanders regenerate retinas after a retinectomy. We also show some cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive axolotl retinal regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Acetovanillone is a major aromatic monomer produced in oxidative/base-catalyzed lignin depolymerization. However, the production of chemical products from acetovanillone has not been explored due to the lack of information on the microbial acetovanillone catabolic system. Here acvABCDEF was identified as specifically induced genes during the growth of Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6 cells with acetovanillone and these genes were essential for SYK-6 growth on acetovanillone and acetosyringone (a syringyl-type acetophenone derivative). AcvAB and AcvF produced in Escherichia coli phosphorylated acetovanillone/acetosyringone and dephosphorylated the phosphorylated acetovanillone/acetosyringone, respectively. AcvCDE produced in Sphingobium japonicum UT26S converted the dephosphorylated phosphorylated acetovanillone/acetosyringone intermediate into vanilloyl acetic acid/3- (4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-3-oxopropanoic acid through carboxylation. To demonstrate the feasibility of producing cis,cis-muconic acid from acetovanillone, a metabolic modification on a mutant of Pseudomonas sp. strain NGC7 that accumulates cis,cis-muconic acid from catechol was performed. The resulting strain expressing vceA and vceB required for converting vanilloyl acetic acid to vanillic acid and aroY encoding protocatechuic acid decarboxylase in addition to acvABCDEF successfully converted 1.2 mM acetovanillone to approximate equimolar cis,cis-muconic acid. Our results are expected to help improve the yield and purity of value-added chemical production from lignin through biological funneling.\n\nIMPORTANCEIn the alkaline oxidation of lignin, aromatic aldehydes (vanillin, syringaldehyde, and p-hydroxybenzaldehyde), aromatic acids (vanillic acid, syringic acid, and p- hydroxybenzoic acid), and acetophenone-related compounds (acetovanillone, acetosyringone, and 4-hydroxyacetophenone) are produced as major aromatic monomers. Also, base-catalyzed depolymerization of guaiacyl lignin resulted in vanillin, vanillic acid, guaiacol, and acetovanillone as primary aromatic monomers. To date, microbial catabolic systems of vanillin, vanillic acid, and guaiacol have been well characterized, and the production of value-added chemicals from them has also been explored. However, due to the lack of information on the microbial acetovanillone and acetosyringone catabolic system, chemical production from acetovanillone and acetosyringone has not been achieved. This is the first study to elucidate the acetovanillone/acetosyringone catabolic system, and to demonstrate the potential of using these genes for value-added chemicals production from these compounds.",

    "abstract": "Hyperglycemia is caused by failure of pancreatic beta cells. Beta-cell inflammation contributes to beta-cell dysfunction, however (primary) immunogenic triggers are in large unknown. The gut microbiota is one potential source of pro-inflammatory molecules. A high-fat diet treatment increases pro-inflammatory bacteria in the gut microbiome, parts of which could migrate to the pancreatic beta-cell. In the present study, the bacterial DNA signature in the pancreas and intestine of C57BL6/J mice was analyzed. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (60% kcal fat) or a regular chow diet for 12 weeks. We took several precautions to avoid and map contamination. The gut microbiota was affected by high-fat diet as following: We observed several common intestinal ASVs in the pancreatic tissue. Although the pancreatic ASVs do not correlate exactly with the gut ASVs, our data implicate that the pancreas contains bacterial DNA and that this signature is altered in high-fat diet fed mice (PERMONOVA, p = 0.037; betadisper, p=0.029). Gut derived bacterial DNA might end up in the pancreas at some point in time. Hence, this work supports the concept of translocation of bacterial DNA to the pancreas, which might contribute to inflammation and dysfunction of pancreatic beta-cells.",

    "abstract": "Members of the mosquito-borne flavivirus genus such as dengue (DENV), West Nile (WNV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses cause distinct diseases and affect different tissues. We previously found that the secreted flaviviral nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) interacts with endothelial cells and disrupts endothelial barrier function in a tissue-specific manner consistent with the disease tropism of the respective viruses. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of this tissue-specific NS1-endothelial cell interaction is not well understood. To elucidate the distinct role(s) that the domains of NS1 ({beta}-roll, wing, and {beta}-ladder) play in NS1 interactions with endothelial cells, we constructed flavivirus NS1 chimeras that exchanged the wing and {beta}-ladder domains in a pair-wise manner between DENV, WNV, and ZIKV NS1. We found that both the NS1 wing and {beta}-ladder domains conferred NS1 tissue-specific endothelial dysfunction, with the wing conferring cell binding and the {beta}-ladder involved in inducing endothelial hyperpermeability as measured by trans-endothelial electrical resistance assay. To narrow down the amino acids dictating cell binding specificity, we utilized the DENV-WNV NS1 chimera and identified residues 91 to 93 (GDI) of DENV NS1 as a molecular motif determining binding specificity. Further, using an in vivo mouse model of localized leak, we found that the GDI motif of the wing domain was essential for triggering DENV NS1-induced vascular leak in mouse dermis. Taken together, we identify molecular determinants of flavivirus NS1 that confer NS1 binding and vascular leak and highlight the importance of the NS1 wing domain for flavivirus pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceFlavivirus NS1 is secreted into the bloodstream from infected cells during a viral infection. Dengue virus NS1 contributes to severe dengue pathology such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak independently of the virus. We have shown that multiple flavivirus NS1 proteins result in endothelial dysfunction in a tissue-specific manner consistent with their respective viral tropism. Here, we aimed to identify the molecular determinants that make some, but not other, flavivirus NS1 proteins bind to select endothelial cells in vitro and cause vascular leak in a mouse model. We identified the wing domain of NS1 as a primary determinant conferring differential endothelial dysfunction and vascular leak and narrowed the contributing amino acid residues to a three-residue motif within the wing domain. The insights from this study pave the way for future studies on the effects of flavivirus NS1 on viral dissemination and pathogenesis and offer potential new avenues for antiviral therapies.",

In the present study, we examine the potential of erythritol, a sugar substitute, for therapeutic intervention that target a multifunctional transporter protein Plasmodium aquaglyceroporin (PfAQP) responsible for maintaining hydro-homeostasis. We show that erythritol effectively inhibited growth and progression of asexual blood stage malaria parasite by suppressing invasion and egress processes. It inhibited the liver stage (sporozoites) and transmission stage parasite (gametocytes) development that suggest its multi-stage, transmission-blocking potential. Interestingly, erythritol inhibited in vivo growth of malaria parasite in mouse experimental model. It was more effective in inhibiting parasite growth both in vivo and in vitro when tested together with a known anti-malarial  artesunate. No Evans blue staining in treated mice indicated erythritol mediated protection of blood-brain barrier integrity in mice infected with P. berghei. Additionally, erythritol showed cytokine-modulating effect which suggest its direct effect on the host immune system. Our results of cellular thermal shift assay and ammonia detection assay demonstrate that erythritol binds with PfAQP and reduce the amount of ammonia release across the parasite respectively. We performed functional complementation assays which suggest that PfAQP expression in yeast mutant restores its growth in hyperosmotic conditions but showed reduced growth in the presence of erythritol, suggesting erythritol as an inhibitor of PfAQP. Overall, our data bestow erythritol as a promising new lead compound with an attractive antimalarial profile and could possibly be combined with known drugs without losing its efficacy.",

Whether these difficulties relate to immature processing of prosodic or linguistic elements of the attended speech is still unclear. To address the impact of noise on linguistic processing per se, we assessed how acoustic noise impacts the cortical tracking of intelligible speech devoid of prosody in school-aged children and adults.\n\nTwenty adults and twenty children (7-9 years) listened to synthesized French monosyllabic words presented at 2.5 Hz, either randomly or in 4-word hierarchical structures wherein 2 words formed a phrase, and 2 phrases formed a sentence, with or without babble noise. Neuromagnetic responses to words, phrases and sentences were identified and source-localized.\n\nChildren and adults displayed significant cortical tracking of words in all conditions, and of phrases and sentences only when words formed meaningful sentences. In children compared with adults, cortical tracking of linguistic units was lower for all units in conditions without noise, and similarly impacted by the addition of babble noise for phrase and sentence units. Critically, when there was noise, adults increased the cortical tracking of monosyllabic words in the inferior frontal gyri but children did not.\n\nThis study demonstrates that the difficulties of school-aged children in understanding speech in a multi-talker background might be partly due to an immature identification of lexical but not supra-lexical linguistic units.\n\nHighlightsO_LIChildren track the hierarchical linguistic units of clear speech devoid of prosody\nC_LIO_LIThis cortical tracking is left-hemisphere dominant as the adult brain\nC_LIO_LIBabble noise reduces cortical tracking of sentences in children and adults\nC_LIO_LIUnlike adults, children are not able to enhance cortical tracking of words in noise\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "During HIV infection, intron-containing viral mRNAs have to be exported efficiently from the host cell nucleus to the cytoplasm in order to complete the replication cycle. To overcome cellular restrictions to export incompletely spliced transcripts, HIV encodes a protein, Rev, that is constitutively expressed from a completely spliced transcript. Rev is then imported into the nucleus where it binds to an RNA structure on intron-containing viral mRNAs called the Rev Response Element (RRE). Bound Rev multimerizes and recruits cellular factors that permit the nuclear export of the resulting ribonucleoprotein complex. Primary HIV isolates display substantial variation in the functional activity of the Rev-RRE axis, which may permit viral adaptation to differing immune environments. We describe two subtype G primary isolates with disparate Rev activity. Rev activity was correlated with in vitro fitness of replication-competent viral constructs. Amino acid differences within the oligomerziation domain, but not within the arginine-rich motif or nuclear export signal, determined the different levels of Rev activity. Two specific amino acid substitutions were demonstrated to be able to alter the low-activity Rev to a high-activity phenotype. However, introducing the original amino acids from the the low activity Rev into high activity Rev in this position did not result in significant alterations in activity, highlighting the importance of the broader sequence context for functional activity. These results demonstrate that studies of Rev and RRE activity variation, which may have broader implications for HIV transmission and pathogenesis, should include sequences from primary isolates, as findings using only laboratory-adapted strains cannot be generalized.",

The study of IAV infections in poultry has been mostly limited to strains from the North American and Eurasian lineages, whereas limited information exists on similar studies with strains from the South American lineage (SAm). To better evaluate the risk of introduction of a prototypical SAm IAV strain into poultry, chickens were infected with a wild-type SAm origin strain (WT557/H6N2). The resulting virus progeny was serially passage in chickens 20 times and the immunopathological effects in chickens of the last passage virus, 20Ch557/H6N2, was compared to those of the parental strain. Comparison of complete viral genome sequences indicated that the 20Ch557/H6N2 strain contained 13 amino acid differences compared to the wild type strain. Five of these mutations are in functionally relevant regions of the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). However, despite higher and more prolonged virus shedding in chickens inoculated with the 20Ch557/H6N2 strain compared to those that received the WT557/H6N2 strain, transmission to naive chickens was not observed for either group.

    "abstract": "The life-threatening pathogen Leptospira interrogans is the most common agent of leptospirosis, an emerging zoonotic disease. However, little is known about the strains that are circulating worldwide due to the fastidious nature of the bacteria and its difficulty to be culture isolated. In addition, the paucity of bacteria in blood and other clinical samples has proven to be a considerable challenge for directly genotyping the agent of leptospirosis directly from patient material.\n\nHere, to elucidate the genomic diversity of Leptospira circulating strains, hybridization capture followed by Illumina sequencing of the core genome was performed directly from 20 biological samples that were PCR positive for pathogenic Leptospira. A set of samples subjected to capture with RNA probes covering the L. interrogans core genome resulted in 72 to 13,000-fold increase in pathogen reads when compared to standard sequencing without capture. A SNP analysis of the genomes sequenced from the biological samples using 273 Leptospira reference genome was then performed in order to determine the genotype of the infecting strain. For samples with sufficent coverage (19/20 samples with coverage >8X), we could unambigously identify L. interrogans sv Icterohaemorrhagiae (14 samples), L. kirschneri sv Grippotyphosa (4 samples) and L. interrogans sv Pyrogenes (1 sample) as the infecting strain.\n\nIn conclusion, we obtained for most of our biological samples high quality genomic data at suitable coverage for confident core genome genotyping of the agent of leptospirosis. The ability to generate culture-free genomic data opens new opportunities to better understand the epidemiology and evolution of this fastidious pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Synonymous recoding of RNA virus genomes is a promising approach for generating attenuated viruses to use as vaccines. Problematically, recoding typically hinders virus growth, but this may be rectified using CpG dinucleotide enrichment. CpGs are recognised by cellular zinc-finger antiviral protein (ZAP), and so in principle, removing ZAP sensing from a virus propagation system will reverse attenuation of a CpG-enriched virus, enabling high titre yield of a vaccine virus. We tested this using a vaccine strain of influenza A virus (IAV) engineered for increased CpG content in genome segment 1. Virus attenuation was mediated by the short isoform of ZAP, correlated with the number of CpGs added, and was enacted via turnover of viral transcripts. The CpG-enriched virus was strongly attenuated in mice, yet conveyed protection from a potentially lethal challenge dose of wildtype virus. Importantly for vaccine development, CpG-enriched viruses were genetically stable during serial passage. Unexpectedly, in both MDCK cells and embryonated hens eggs that are used to propagate live attenuated influenza vaccines, the ZAP-sensitive virus was fully replication competent. Thus, ZAP- sensitive CpG enriched viruses that are defective in human systems can yield high titre in vaccine propagation systems, providing a realistic, economically viable platform to augment existing live attenuated vaccines.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCpG dinucleotides are under-represented in vertebrate genomes, wherein cytosines in the CpG conformation are methylated to regulate transcription. Methylated cytosines are prone to deamination, resulting in TpG dinucleotides replacing CpGs. The resultant CpG suppression has provided a route by which vertebrate cells can recognise RNA from invading pathogens, using cellular Zinc-finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) as a CpG sensor. Vertebrate-infecting RNA viruses also genomically suppress CpGs, and it is believed that this is an evolved trait to evade detection by ZAP. Here, we engineered an influenza A virus (IAV) with elevated CpG content and characterised how this impacts viral replication. CpG addition resulted in viral attenuation, mediated by ZAP activity. CpG suppression is conserved in dog and chicken genomes (relevant for live attenuated IAV vaccine propagation), and it is logical to predict that ZAP-mediated CpG sensing would also be conserved in these species. However, when we propagated ZAP-sensitive IAV in cognate culture systems, we saw no replication defect. This unexpected result raises questions about why viruses infecting these species suppress CpG in their genomes, and importantly delivers a new, tractable approach to augment rational live attenuated IAV vaccine design.",

    "abstract": "The ability for adaptation to keep pace with environmental change largely depends on how efficiently selection can act on heritable genetic variation. Complex life cycles may either promote or constrain adaptation depending on the integration or independence of fitness-related traits over development. Reef-building corals exhibit complex life cycles and are sensitive to increasing temperatures, highlighting the need to understand the heritable potential of the thermal stress response and how it is regulated over development. Here we used tag-based RNA-seq to profile global gene expression in inshore and offshore P. astreoides adults and their offspring recruits in response to a 16-day heat stress, and larvae from separate families in response to a 4-day heat stress, to test whether gene expression patterns differentiating adult populations, and potentially underlying differences in thermal tolerance, persist in thermally naive life stages. Host developmental stage had a major effect on both host and symbiont expression, despite symbionts being directly inherited from parent colonies, and modulated the response to thermal stress, suggesting the holobiont response to selection varies across life stages. Populations also exhibited origin-specific treatment responses, but the magnitude of the response differed among populations and life stages. Inshore parents and their juvenile offspring exhibited a more robust response to heat stress compared to offshore-origin corals, indicating expression plasticity may be heritable. However, larval populations exhibited the opposite response, possibly due to stage-specific differences or exposure duration. Overall, this study shows that putatively adaptive regulatory variation can be heritable, but the identity of thermally responsive genes are stage-specific, which will have major implications for predicting the evolutionary response of corals in a changing environment.",

The biological activities of Helichrysum Italicum essential oil and neryl acetate were compared to identify how neryl acetate contributes to Helichrysum Italicum essential oil activity on human skin. Neryl acetate, as a part component of Helichrysum Italicum essential oil, was tested on skin explant models for 24 hours and 5 days in comparison with Helichrysum Italicum essential oil. We analyzed the biological regulations in the skin explant by transcriptomic analysis, skin barrier protein immunofluorescence, lipid staining and ceramide analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that 41.5% of Helichrysum Italicum essential oil-modulated genes were also regulated by neryl acetate and a selected panel of genes were confirmed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis. Those genes are involved in epidermal differentiation, skin barrier formation and ceramide synthesis. Involucrin, involved in formation of the cornified envelope, was upregulated at both gene and protein levels after 24 hours and 5 days respectively. After 5 days of treatment, total lipids and ceramides were also increased.

    "abstract": "Positive allosteric modulators for free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFA2R/GPR43), that affect receptor function through binding to two distinct allosteric binding sites, were used to determine the correlation between the responses induced in neutrophils by two distinct activation modes; FFA2R was activated either by the orthosteric agonist propionate or by a receptor transactivation mechanism that activated FFA2R from the cytosolic side of the neutrophil plasma membrane by signals generated by the neutrophil PAFR (receptor for platelet activating factor), P2Y2R (receptor for ATP), FPR1 (receptor for fMLF) and FPR2 (receptor for WKYMVM). We show that the transactivation signals that activate FFA2R in the absence of any orthosteric agonist were generated downstream of the signaling G protein that couple to PAFR and P2Y2R. This transactivation of allosterically modulated FFA2Rs, by signals generated by PAFR/P2Y2R, represents a novel mechanism by which a G protein coupled receptor can be activated. Weak correlations were obtained when the FFA2R activity was induced by the transactivation signals generated by PAFRs and P2Y2Rs were compared with the FFA2R activity induced by the orthosteric agonist propionate. Comparison of the responses for each allosteric modulator revealed that the ratio values, calculated from the peak values of the ATP and propionate responses, varied from 0.2 to 1. Depending on the allosteric modulator, the response induced by the two different mechanisms (orthosteric activation and receptor transactivation, respectively), was equal or the propionate response was more pronounced. Importantly, we conclude that FFA2R activation from outside (orthosteric activation) and inside (receptor cross-talk/transactivation) can be selectively affected by an allosteric FFA2R modulator.\n\nO_LIThe allosterically modulated FFA2R is transactivated by signals generated by other GPCRs.\nC_LIO_LIThe PAF and ATP receptors transactivate FFA2R from the cytosolic side of the membrane.\nC_LIO_LIThe mechanisms that regulates activation of FFA2R from outside and inside differ.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The mammalian genome is partitioned into active and inactive regions, broadly termed euchromatin and heterochromatin, respectively. The majority of heterochromatin consists of repetitive elements, including endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). ERVs are enriched in regulatory elements containing transcription factor (TF) binding sites with individual families containing hundreds to thousands of distinct copies scattered throughout the genome. We hypothesized that epigenetic derepression of ERVs (such as that observed during early development) may alter the stoichiometry between TFs and their euchromatic target sites, with ERVs effectively competing for these factors. To test this, we modeled acute heterochromatin loss using inducible deletion of the co-repressor KAP1 in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Upon KAP1 deletion, we observe clear reductions in chromatin accessibility, histone acetylation, and TF binding at euchromatic regions. To directly test the concept of global binding site competition, we designed exogenous binding site arrays (EBSAs) to introduce upwards of 1500 copies of the OCT4 TF binding motif into ESCs. OCT4 EBSAs specifically reduce chromatin accessibility at POU family motifs and result in reduced transcription of the pluripotency machinery with subsequent differentiation. Overall, these data support a model in which heterochromatin at ERVs promotes euchromatic TF binding and transcriptional homoeostasis. We propose that regulated ERV derepression during pre-implantation may serve as a developmental siphon to weaken the robustness of ongoing transcription programs in favor of the plasticity required for cell fate specification.",

    "abstract": "Cellular forces and intercellular cooperation generate collective cell migration. Pathological changes in cell-level genetic and physical properties cause jamming, unjamming, and scattering in epithelial migration. Separately, changes in microenvironment stiffness and confinement can produce varying modes of cell migration. However, it remains unclear whether and how mesoscale disruptions in matrix topology alter collective cell migration. To address this question, we microfabricated matrices with stumps of defined geometry, density, and orientation, which serve as obstructions in the path of collectively migrating healthy mammary epithelial cells. Here, we show that cells lose their speed and directionality when moving through dense obstructions, compared to those sparsely spaced. On flat surfaces, leader cells are significantly stiffer than follower cells, while dense obstructions lead to the overall softening of cells. In moving through dense obstructions, epithelial cells lose the sense of leaders and followers in their physical properties, migration phenotypes, and fluidity. Although Rac inhibition reduces obstruction sensitivity, loss of cell-cell cooperation and induction of leader-like phenotype via -catenin depletion eliminates the effect of matrix obstructions on epithelial migration. Through a lattice-based model, we identify cellular protrusions, polarity, and leader-follower communication as key mechanisms for obstruction-sensitive collective cell migration. Together, microscale cytoskeletal response, mesoscale softening and disorder, and macroscale multicellular communication enable epithelial cell populations to sense topological obstructions encountered in challenging environments. These results reveal that cohesive, healthy populations are more obstruction sensitive than the dysfunctional, aggressive ones. The  obstruction-sensitivity could add to the emerging disease  mechanotypes such as cell stiffness and traction forces.",

    "abstract": "Density modification is a standard step to provide a route for routine structure solution by any experimental phasing method -with SAD and MAD being the most popular ones- as well as to extend fragments or incomplete models into a full solution. The effect of density modification on the starting maps from either source is illustrated in the case of SHELXE. The different modes in which the program can run are reviewed; these include less well-known uses such as reading external phase values and weights or phase distributions encoded in Hendrickson-Lattman coefficients. Typically in SHELXE, initial phases are calculated from experimental data, from a partial model or map, or from a combination of both sources. The initial phase set is improved and extended by density modification and, if the resolution of the data and the type of structure permits, poly-alanine tracing. The trace now includes an extension into the gamma position or hydrophobic and aromatic side chains if a sequence is provided, which is performed in every tracing cycle. Once a correlation coefficient over 30% between the structure factors calculated from such a trace and the native data indicates that the structure has been solved, in all model building cycles sequence is docked and side chains are fitted if the map supports it. The extensions to the tracing algorithm brought in to provide a complete model are discussed. The improvement in phasing performance is assessed using a set of tests.\n\nSynopsisSide chain tracing now completes model building in SHELXE to enhance density modification.

    "abstract": "The environmental pathogenic bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum kills Gram-positive bacteria delivering violacein packed into outer membrane vesicles, but nothing is known about its contact-dependent competition mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that C. violaceum utilizes a type VI secretion system (T6SS) containing multiple VgrG proteins primarily for interbacterial competition. The single T6SS of C. violaceum contains six vgrG genes, which are located in the main T6SS cluster and four vgrG islands. Using T6SS-core component null mutant strains, western blot, fluorescence microscopy, and competition assays, we show that the C. violaceum T6SS is active and required for competition against Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa but dispensable for C. violaceum infection in mice. Characterization of single and multiple vgrG mutants revealed that, despite having high sequence similarity, the six VgrGs show little functional redundancy, with VgrG3 showing a major role in T6SS function. Our coimmunoprecipitation data support a model of VgrG3 assembling heterotrimers with the other VgrGs. Moreover, we determined that the promoter activities of T6SS genes increased at high cell density, but the produced Hcp protein was not secreted under such condition. This T6SS growth-phase-dependent regulation was dependent on CviR but not on CviI, the components of a C. violaceum quorum sensing (QS) system. Indeed, a {Delta}cviR but not a {Delta}cviI mutant was completely defective in Hcp secretion, T6SS activity, and interbacterial competition. Overall, our data reveal that C. violaceum relies on a QS-regulated T6SS to outcompete other bacteria and expand our knowledge about the redundancy of multiple VgrGs.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a contractile nanomachine used by many Gram-negative bacteria to inject toxic effectors into adjacent cells. The delivered effectors are bound to the components of a puncturing apparatus containing the protein VgrG. The T6SS has been implicated in pathogenesis and, more commonly, in competition among bacteria. Chromobacterium violaceum is an environmental bacterium that causes deadly infections in humans. In this work, we characterized the single T6SS of C. violaceum ATCC 12472, including its six VgrG proteins, regarding its function and regulation. This previously undescribed C. violaceum T6SS is active, regulated by QS, and required for interbacterial competition instead of acute infection in mice. Among the VgrGs, VgrG3, encoded outside of the main T6SS cluster, showed a major contribution to T6SS function. These results shed light on a key contact-dependent killing mechanism used by C. violaceum to antagonize other bacteria.",

Our results indicate a strong impact of viral infection on host cellular transcript levels but a modest impact on global translation rates. Analysis of ribosome profiling reads from viral transcripts reveals extensive and productive non-AUG translation of small peptides from multiple upstream open reading-frames (uORFs) located in the 5 long terminal repeat.

    "abstract": "Severe non-healing infections are often caused by multiple pathogens or by genetic variants of the same pathogen exhibiting different levels of antibiotic resistance. For example, polymicrobial diabetic foot infections double the risk of amputation compared to monomicrobial infections. Although these infections lead to increased morbidity and mortality, standard antimicrobial susceptibility methods are designed for homogenous samples and are impaired in quantifying heteroresistance. Here, we propose a droplet-based label-free method for quantifying the antibiotic response of the entire population at the single-cell level. We used Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus samples to confirm that the shape of the profile informs about the coexistence of diverse bacterial subpopulations, their sizes, and antibiotic heteroresistance. These profiles could therefore indicate the outcome of antibiotic treatment in terms of the size of remaining subpopulations. Moreover, we studied phenotypic variants of a S. aureus strain to confirm that the profile can be used to identify tolerant subpopulations, such as small colony variants, associated with increased risks for the development of persisting infections. Therefore, the profile is a versatile instrument for quantifying the size of each bacterial subpopulation within a specimen as well as their individual and joined heteroresistance.",

(Viannia) braziliensis being the main etiologic agent of cutaneous and mucosal leishmaniasis. We developed two assays targeting multi-copy targets commonly used in the molecular diagnosis of leishmaniasis: the 18S ribosomal RNA gene (18S rDNA), highly conserved across Leishmania species, and a region of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) minicircles conserved in the L. (Viannia) subgenus. Our CRISPR-based assays were capable of detecting down to 5 x 10-2 (kDNA) or 5 x 100 (18S rDNA) parasite genome equivalents/reaction with PCR preamplification. The 18S PCR/CRISPR assay achieved pan-Leishmania detection, whereas the kDNA PCR/CRISPR assay was specific for L. (Viannia) detection. No cross-reaction was observed with Trypanosoma cruzi strain Y or human DNA. We evaluated the performance of the assays using 49 clinical samples compared to a kDNA real-time PCR assay as the reference test. The kDNA PCR/CRISPR assay performed equally well as the reference test, with positive and negative percent agreement of 100%. The 18S PCR/CRISPR assay had high positive and negative percent agreement of 82.1% and 100%, respectively. The findings support the potential applicability of the newly developed CRISPR-based molecular tools for first-line diagnosis of Leishmania infections at the genus and L. (Viannia) subgenus levels.",

    "abstract": "In aging, skeletal muscle strength and regenerative capacity declines due, in part, to functional impairment of muscle stem cells (MuSCs), yet the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we capitalize on mass-cytometry to identify high CD47 expression as a hallmark of dysfunctional MuSCs (CD47hi) with impaired regenerative capacity that predominate with aging. The prevalent CD47hi MuSC subset suppresses the residual functional CD47lo MuSC subset through a paracrine signaling loop, leading to impaired proliferation. We uncover that elevated CD47 levels on aged MuSCs result from increased U1 snRNA expression, which disrupts alternative polyadenylation. The deficit in aged MuSC function in regeneration can be overcome either by morpholino-mediated blocking of CD47 alternative polyadenylation or antibody blockade of CD47 signaling, leading to improved regeneration in aged mice, with therapeutic implications. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized age-dependent alteration in CD47 levels and function in MuSCs, which underlies reduced muscle repair in aging.",

    "abstract": "Downy mildew is caused by Plasmopara viticola, an obligate oomycete plant pathogen, a devasting disease for grapevine. To preserve plants from the disease, complex III inhibitors are among the widely used fungicides that specifically target the mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) of the pathogen to block cellular respiration mechanisms. In French vineyard, P. viticola developed resistance against a first category of these fungicides, the Quinone outside inhibitors, by exhibiting a single amino acid substitution G143A in its cytb mitochondrial sequence. Their usage was restricted and another kind of fungicides, Quinone inside inhibitors, targeting the same gene and highly effective against oomycetes, were used instead. Recently however, less sensitive P. viticola populations were detected after treatments with some inhibitors, in particular ametoctradin and cyazofamid. By isolating resistant single-sporangia strains of P. viticola to these fungicides, we characterized new variants in cytb sequences associated with cyazofamid resistance: a point mutation (L201S) and more strikingly, two insertions (E203-DE-V204, E203-VE-V204). In parallel with classical tools, pyrosequencing and RT-PCR, we then benchmarked both short and long-reads NGS technologies (Ion Torrent, Illumina, Oxford Nanopore Technologies) to sequence the complete cytb with the prospect to detect and assess the proportion of resistant variants of P. viticola at a natural population scale. Eighteen populations collected from French vineyard fields in 2020 were analysed: 12 show a variable proportion of G143A, 11 of E203-DE-V204 and 7 populations of the S34L variant that confers resistance to ametoctradin. Interestingly, long reads were able to identify variants, including SNPs, with confidence and detect a small proportion of P. viticola showing several variants along the same cytb sequence. Altogether, NGS appear promising methods to evaluate pathogen resistance towards fungicides related to cytb modifications at a population scale in the field. This approach could be rapidly a robust decision-support management tool for vineyard in future.",
