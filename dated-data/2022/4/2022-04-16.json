    "abstract": "The development of non-invasive live ocular imaging and electrophysiological test systems for rodent eyes provides new tools for not only averaged analysis of the entire retina but also the ability to see, test, and compare different subregions of the same retina. These new capabilities provide the possibility for more detailed examinations of local structural and functional relationships within a single eye and the ability to also follow changes longitudinally over time. We have developed protocols based around the Micron-III/IV retinal imaging camera system for combining fluorescent imaging of the neural retinal micro-vasculature by FA (fluorescein angiography), imaging of all neural retinal layers by SD-OCT (Spectral-Domain Ocular Coherence Tomography), and focal \"spot\" light-targeted electroretinography (Focal-ERG) to relate the local neurovascular unit structure to the inner (photoreceptor) and outer-retinal electrical response to light stimulation. For demonstration purposes we have used the popular mouse oxygen induced retinopathy (OIR) model, which causes radial central patches of retinal neuron loss mostly in zones away from and between the primary retinal arteries and veins. In this model, the loss of central microvasculature is induced developmentally in mouse litters exposed to 75% oxygen from age P7 to P11. Return to room air on P12, causes several days of retinal ischemia during which neurons, mostly of the inner retina, perish. Bipolar and ganglion cell death ends as neovascular growth revascularizes the central retina. This model provides for non-uniform retinal damage as well as gradual progression and resolution over time. The OIR model was used to generate regions of inner retinal neuron loss in B6.Cg-TgThy1-YFP mice. Using image-guided focal-ERG, the dark-adapted mixed rod-cone light response was compared using stimulation of small circular (0.27 mm diameter) target areas located in the central retinas of the same eyes (OIR and control). The same areas of the same retinas were followed over three ages after revascularization (P21, P28 and P42).\n\nConclusionsCombined FA and SD-OCT imaging can provide local geographic specific information on retinal structural changes and be used to select different retinal areas within the same eye for testing of local light response. This analysis strategy can be employed for studies with rodent disease models that do not uniformly impact the entire retinal area. Combining these techniques would also be useful for testing gene and cell replacement therapies in retinal degeneration models where typically a small zone of the retina is treated. Both treated and untreated retinal zones within the eye can be followed non-invasively over many weeks.\n\nSUMMARYMouse models utilized for retinal disease research including retinal vascular models can display nonuniform changes over the entire retina. Damage or loss of retinal layers and retinal neurons due to hypoxia can impact some retinal areas while leaving adjacent regions unaltered. Combining vascular imaging by fluoresceine angiography, vascular imaging and retinal layer imaging by SD-OCT, and focal-ERG provides us with new tools to examine retinal structure-function relationships within a single retina.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTumour-cell detachment is a critical early event in the metastatic cascade. However, the role of the cells mechanical properties in detachment and migration is not well understood. This exploratory study aimed to assess how intracellular stiffness changes these processes.\n\nMethodsMDA-MB-231 cells were embedded as 10,000-cell spheroids in 2 and 4 mg/ml collagen matrices. Intracellular stiffness was assessed with mitochondria tracking microrheology of cells that migrated distances equivalent to four and six times the cell diameter (dC) from the spheroid and compared to cells at the spheroid surface (0dC), representing medium, high and no migration, respectively.\n\nResults and discussionThe mitochondrial mean square displacement and intracellular stiffness decreased during detachment and migration for both collagen concentrations (i.e. rigidities). The mean square displacement of 4dC and 6dC cells was similar, whereas cell stiffness was lower for 4dC than for 6dC cells. With increasing matrix rigidity, the intracellular stiffness decreased for 0dC cells and did not change for 4dC and 6dC cells. It is proposed that decreased cell stiffness drives detachment and migration and increased matrix rigidity physically hinders migration, and cells need to become softer or remodel the environment to migrate. The independence of the stiffness of migrated cells from matrix rigidity suggests that cells remodel their environment through matrix proteins cleavage to migrate.\n\nConclusionsThe study revealed the collective effects of enhanced migratory conditions and increased matrix rigidity on the mechanical properties of the cells. The expression of matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor {beta} and the role of cell volume on detachment and migration in matrices with varying pore sizes are proposed targets for further studies on metastatic cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) protein degradation regulates protein abundance and eliminates mis-folded and damaged proteins from eukaryotic cells. Variation in UPS activity influences numerous cellular and organismal phenotypes. However, to what extent such variation results from individual genetic differences is almost entirely unknown. Here, we developed a statistically powerful mapping approach to characterize the genetic basis of variation in UPS activity. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we systematically mapped genetic influences on the N-end rule, a UPS pathway that recognizes N-degrons, degradation-promoting signals in protein N-termini. We identified 149 genomic loci that influence UPS activity across the complete set of N-degrons. Resolving four loci to individual causal nucleotides identified regulatory and missense variants in ubiquitin system genes whose products process (NTA1), recognize (UBR1 and DOA10), and ubiquitinate (UBC6) cellular proteins. Each of these genes contained multiple causal variants and several individual variants had substrate-specific effects on UPS activity. A cis-acting promoter variant that modulates UPS activity by altering UBR1 expression also alters the abundance of 36 proteins without affecting levels of the corresponding mRNAs. Our results demonstrate that natural genetic variation shapes the full sequence of molecular events in protein ubiquitination and implicate genetic influences on the UPS as a prominent source of post-translational variation in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Genes are commonly abstracted into a coding sequence and cis-regulatory elements (CREs), such as promoters and terminators, and short sequence motifs within these regions. Modern cloning techniques allow easy assembly of synthetic genetic constructs from discrete cis-regulatory modules. However, it is unclear how much the contributions of CREs to gene expression depend on other CREs in the host gene. Using budding yeast, we probe the extent of composability, or independent effects, of distinct CREs. We confirm that the quantitative effect of a terminator on gene expression depends on both promoter and coding sequence. We then explore whether individual cisregulatory motifs within terminator regions display similar context dependence, using transcriptomewide datasets of mRNA decay. To test the extent of composability, we construct reporter genes consisting of combinations of motifs within various terminator contexts, paired with different promoters. Our results show that the effect of a motif on RNA abundance depends both on its host terminator, and also on the associated promoter sequence. This emphasises the need for improved motif inference that includes both local and global context effects, which in turn could aid in the accurate use of CREs for the engineering of synthetic genetic constructs.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, ectotherm species have largely been impacted by extreme climate events, essentially heatwaves. In Tunisia, the pine processionary moth (PPM), Thaumetopoea pityocampa, is a highly damaging pine defoliator, which typically lays eggs in summer. Its geographical range is expanding northwards in Europe while retracting from South Tunisia where summer temperatures can reach extremely high values. In this study, we aimed at exploring the effects of climate change on this species at its southern range edge. We investigated variations of fecundity and causes of egg mortality over time using historical and contemporary collections of egg masses from different Tunisian sites to seek relationships with regional climate change over three decades (1990-2019). Our results suggest negative effects of summer heat on egg survival, reflected in a decrease of hatching rate down to 0% in one site during a heatwave. Such a high hatching failure was found to result from both high egg sterility (our results did not allow distinguishing impeded mating success from failed egg maturation or early death of the embryo) and increased abortion of more developed embryos, but little effects of parasitism rate, thereby suggesting vulnerability to heat during embryonic development. We also observed decreasing female fecundity (i.e., number of eggs laid per female) in regions where data were available both in the 1990s and the 2010s, which was associated with a decrease in parasitism rate, while the climatic variability increased. This study investigated direct hatching failure in nature that may be related to the magnitude of warming in summer. Previous studies have confirmed the thermal sensitivity of early instars of the PPM to temperatures observed in the present work, including one population from South Tunisia. However, further work is required to evaluate the relative importance of warming summers among populations because the risk of heat stress depends on the phenology of sensitive instars, and populations from the warmest areas may not necessarily be the most vulnerable to climate change if they already evolved phenological heat avoidance. In addition to heat-induced mortality, the ultimate fitness of individuals that survive challenging heat stresses during early developmental stages should also be explored to determine potential carry-over effects on subsequent life stages.",

    "abstract": "Immunosenescence, oxidative stress, and low vaccine efficacy are important symptoms of aging. The goal of our study was to see if quercetin had anti-aging and stimulating effects on PBMC immune cells in vitro. In the presence of concanavalin a, PBMCs were isolated from healthy elderly and young people and cultured in a complete RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with quercetin. Cell proliferation was assessed using the MTT colorimetric assay after a 48-hour incubation period. Spectrophophotometric assays were used to assess oxidative biomarkers (PC, MDA, and GSH). The ELISA method was used to determine the amount of IL-2 released. A Griess reagent was used to investigate iNOS activity. When compared to young control cells, aged PBMCs had lower proliferation potency, lower IL-2 and NO release, and higher MDA and PC levels. Importantly, quercetin-treated aged PBMCs have a high proliferative response comparable to young cells, restored iNOS activity, and increased levels of GSH antioxidant defences. In comparison to untreated aged PBMCs, treated PBMCs have lower lipo-oxidative damage but higher PC levels. Quercetin may be used as a promising dietary vaccinal adjuvant in the elderly, it has significant effects in reducing immunosenescence hallmarks, as well as mitigating the lipo-oxidative stress in PBMCs cells.\n\nPractical abstractQuercetin is a common dietary polyphenol found in fruits and vegetables that is well known for its antioxidant activity in radical scavenging and anticancer properties characterized by immune system stimulation. In vitro, quercetin boosts immune responses in the elderly and reduces immunosenescence symptoms, according to our findings. As a result, this molecule could be a safe and promising vaccine adjuvant for boosting immunity and reducing aging complications in immune cells as well as reducing oxidative stress in PBMC cells.",

Body composition, regional AT distribution, lipid-lipoprotein profile, glucose homeostasis and plasma A and L levels were determined in 67 women (age: 40-62 years; BMI: 17-41 kg/m2). Expression of macrophage infiltration marker CD68 and adipocyte size were measured from subcutaneous abdominal (SCABD) and omental (OME) fat. AT dysfunction markers correlated with most lipid-lipoprotein levels. The A/L ratio was negatively associated with fasting insulinemia and HOMA-IR, while SCABD or OME adipocyte size and SCABD CD68 expression were positively related to these variables. Combination of tertiles of largest adipocyte size and lowest A/L ratio showed the highest HOMA-IR. Multiple regression analyses including these markers and TAG levels revealed that the A/L ratio was the only predictor of fasting insulinemia and HOMA-IR. The contribution of the A/L ratio was superseded by adipose cell size in the model where the latter replaced TAGs. Finally, leptinemia was a better predictor of IR than adipocyte size and the A/L ratio in our participant sample.",

    "abstract": "Various chemical cues are known to alter the motile and sessile states of bacteria differentially and, in turn, the formation of biofilms. However, the underlying mechanisms at the cellular and molecular level remain less understood, which severely limits our ability to control biofilms. Here, we systematically studied the effects of NaCl on the dynamics of biofilm formation across various length scales and the associated changes in the regulation of gene expression in an undomesticated natural isolate of Bacillus subtilis. Interestingly, NaCl induced significant changes in the architecture of pellicles and yielded systematic increase in lateral expansion rates of biofilms when grown on an agar surface. At the microscopic level, both in the presence and absence of NaCl, bacteria displayed super-diffusive motion at times lesser than a second. However, at larger delay times, we observed an intriguing NaCl-induced transition from sub-diffusion behavior of individual bacterial cells to rapid diffusion behavior. In addition, NaCl reduced the dynamical heterogeneity of the bacterial cells within the biofilm. The reduced heterogeneity and the increased flagellation in a subpopulation of cells in the presence of NaCl corroborates well with the observed higher motility of the cells. Further, the cellular uptake of NaCl resulted in the downregulation of several genes underlying the formation of biofilms, revealing the role of chemical cues like NaCl in controlling the gene regulatory circuit underlying the sessile to motile transition. Our study opens a new avenue to decipher the competitive advantage provided to the subcellular populations by NaCl due to lifestyle switch in Bacillus subtilis.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacterial blooms pose a serious threat to public health due to the presence of cyanotoxins. The most common cyanotoxins, microcystins (MCs), can cause acute poisoning at high concentrations and hepatocellular carcinoma following chronic exposure. Among all MC variants, MC-LR produced by Microcystis aeruginosa PCC 7806 is the most common toxic MC. Although the biosynthetic pathway for MC-LR has been proposed, experimental support of this pathway is lacking. In an effort to experimentally validate this pathway, we expressed the 55 kb microcystin biosynthetic gene cluster (mcy cluster) (mcyA-J) and produced MC-LR in the model cyanobacterium Synechococcus 7942. We designed and constructed the strong bidirectional promoter biPpsbA2 between mcyA and mcyD, reassembled the mcy cluster in yeast by transformation-associated recombination (TAR cloning), transformed the gene cluster into the NSII site of Synechococcus 7942, and successfully expressed MC-LR at a level of 0.006-0.018 fg cell-1 day-1. The expression of MC-LR led to abnormal cell division and the filamentation of Synechococcus 7942 cells, further analysis proved a role of MC-LR in functional assembly of the cell division protein FtsZ, by competing its GTP binding site. These results represent the first synthetic biological expression of the mcy cluster and the autotrophic production of MC-LR in a photosynthetic model organism, which lays the foundation for resolving the MC biosynthesis pathway.

    "abstract": "Most cases of preterm labor have unknown cause, and the burden of preterm birth is immense. Placental aging has been proposed to promote labor onset, but specific mechanisms remain elusive. We report findings stemming from unbiased transcriptomic analysis of mouse placenta, which revealed that hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) stabilization is a hallmark of advanced gestational timepoints, accompanied by mitochondrial dysregulation and cellular senescence; we detected similar effects in aging human placenta. In parallel in primary mouse trophoblasts and human choriocarcinoma cells, we modeled HIF-1 induction and demonstrated resultant mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular senescence. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that HIF-1 stabilization recapitulated gene signatures observed in aged placenta. Further, conditioned media from trophoblasts following HIF-1 induction promoted contractility in immortalized uterine myocytes, suggesting a mechanism by which the aging placenta may drive the transition from uterine quiescence to contractility at the onset of labor. Finally, pharmacological induction of HIF-1 via intraperitoneal administration of dimethyloxalyl glycine (DMOG) to pregnant mice caused preterm labor. These results provide clear evidence for placental aging in normal pregnancy, and demonstrate how HIF-1 signaling in late gestation may be a causal determinant of the mitochondrial dysfunction and senescence observed within the trophoblast as well as a trigger for uterine contraction.",

Molecular dynamics simulations reveal TG depletion promotes spontaneous TG and SE de-mixing in LDs, additionally altering the lipid packing of the phospholipid monolayer surface. Fluorescence imaging and proteomics further reveal that liquid-crystalline phases are associated with selective remodeling of the LD proteome. Some canonical LD proteins including Erg6 re-localize to the ER network, whereas others remain LD-associated. Model peptide LiveDrop also redistributes from LDs to the ER, suggesting liquid-crystalline-phases influence ER-LD inter organelle transport. Our data suggests glucose restriction drives TG mobilization, which alters the phase properties of LD lipids and selectively remodels the LD proteome.",

    "abstract": "A body of work spanning neuroscience, economics, and psychology indicates that decisionmaking is context-dependent, which means that the value of an option depends not only on the option in question, but also on the other options in the choice set--or the  context. While context effects have been observed primarily in small-scale laboratory studies with tightly constrained, artificially constructed choice sets, it remains to be determined whether these context effects take hold in real-world choice problems, where choice sets are large and decisions driven by rich histories of direct experience. Here, we investigate whether valuations are context-dependent in real-world choice by analyzing a large restaurant rating dataset (Yelp.com) as well as two independent replication datasets which provide complementary operationalizations of restaurant choice. We find that users make fewer ratings-maximizing choices in choice sets with higher-rated options--a hallmark of context-dependent choice-- and that post-choice restaurant ratings also varied systematically with the ratings of unchosen restaurants. Furthermore, in a follow-up laboratory experiment using hypothetical choice sets matched to the real-world data, we find further support for the idea that subjective valuations of restaurants are scaled in accordance with the choice context, providing corroborating evidence for a general mechanistic-level account of these effects. Taken together, our results provide a potent demonstration of context-dependent choice in real-world choice settings, manifesting both in decisions and subjective valuation of options.",

    "abstract": "Burkholderia vietnamiensis LMG10929 (Bv) and Paraburkholderia kururiensis M130 (Pk) are bacterial rice growth-promoting models. Besides this common ecological niche, species of the Burkholderia genus are also found as opportunistic human pathogens while Paraburkholderia are mostly environmental and plant-associated species. Here, we compared the genetic strategies used by Bv and Pk to colonize two subspecies of their common host, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica (cv. Nipponbare) and ssp. indica (cv. IR64). We used high-throughput screening of transposon insertional mutant libraries (Tn-seq) to infer which genetic elements have the highest fitness contribution during root surface colonization at 7 days post inoculation. Overall, we detected twice more genes in Bv involved in rice roots colonization compared to Pk, including genes contributing to the tolerance of plant defenses, which suggests a stronger adverse reaction of rice towards Bv compared to Pk. For both strains, the bacterial fitness depends on a higher number of genes when colonizing indica rice compared to japonica. These divergences in host pressure on bacterial adaptation could be partly linked to the cultivars differences in nitrogen assimilation. We detected several functions commonly enhancing root colonization in both bacterial strains e.g., Entner-Doudoroff (ED) glycolysis. Less frequently and more strain-specifically, we detected functions limiting root colonization such as biofilm production in Bv and quorum sensing in Pk. The involvement of genes identified through the Tn-seq procedure as contributing to root colonization i.e., ED pathway, c-di-GMP cycling and cobalamin synthesis, was validated by directed mutagenesis and competition with WT strains in rice root colonization assays.\n\nImportanceBurkholderiaceae are frequent and abundant colonizers of the rice rhizosphere and interesting candidates to investigate for growth promotion. Species of Paraburkholderia have repeatedly been described to stimulate plant growth. However, the closely related Burkholderia genus hosts both beneficial and phytopathogenic species, as well as species able to colonize animal hosts and cause disease in humans. We need to understand to what extent the bacterial strategies used for the different biotic interactions differ depending on the host and if strains with agricultural potential could also pose a threat towards other plant hosts or humans. To start answering these questions, we used here transposon sequencing to identify genetic traits in Burkholderia vietnamiensis and Paraburkholderia kururiensis that contribute to the colonization of two different rice varieties. Our results revealed large differences in the fitness gene sets between the two strains and between the host plants, suggesting a strong specificity in each bacterium-plant interaction.",

    "abstract": "Low intensity prescribed fire is a critical strategy for mitigating the effects of catastrophic wildfires. The above-ground response to fire has been well-documented, including many ecosystem benefits associated with prescribed burning, but fewer studies have directly addressed the effect of prescribed fire on soil organisms. We aimed to understand how soil microbial communities respond to prescribed fire and to determine the ecological processes driving their dynamics. We extensively sampled four plots for 17 months in a mixed conifer forest in northern California, USA; immediately following a low-intensity prescribed fire, a higher-intensity prescribed fire, and two no-burn control plots. We found that prescribed fire significantly altered the community structure for both fungi (ITS) and bacteria (16S), which was sustained throughout the time-series. By comparing our community profiling results with a model of neutral community assembly, we found that the presence of most taxa across all experimental conditions could be explained by neutral processes. However, combining threshold indicator taxa analysis and correlation network analysis with the neutral model identified a cohort of taxa that responded deterministically to prescribed fire. The subcommunity identified through this series of analyses includes both known and new pyrophilous taxa. Beyond this, our analyses revealed network modules within postfire communities which were responsive to fire-intensity. Taken together, these results lay the foundation for building a process-driven understanding of microbial community assembly in the context of the classical disturbance regime of fire.",

    "abstract": "Regression of atherosclerosis is impaired in diabetes. However, the factors mediating this effect remain incomplete. We identified Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 2 (PRMT2) as a protein whose expression in macrophages is reduced in hyperglycemia and diabetes. PRMT2 catalyzes arginine methylation to target proteins to modulate gene expression. Because PRMT2 expression is reduced in cells in hyperglycemia, we wanted to determine whether PRMT2 plays a causal role in the impairment of atherosclerosis regression in diabetes. We therefore examined the consequence of deleting PRMT2 in myeloid cells during regression of atherosclerosis in normal and diabetic mice. Remarkably, we found a significant impairment of atherosclerosis regression under normoglycemic conditions in mice lacking PRMT2 (Prmt2-/-) in myeloid cells that mimics the decrease in regression of atherosclerosis in WT mice under diabetic conditions. This was associated with increased plaque macrophage retention, as well as increased apoptosis and necrosis. PRMT2-deficient plaque CD68+ cells under normoglycemic conditions showed increased expression of genes involved in cytokine signaling and inflammation compared to WT. Consistently Prmt2-/- bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) showed an increased response of pro-inflammatory genes to LPS, and a decreased response of inflammation resolving genes to IL-4. This increased response to LPS in Prmt2-/- BMDMs is via enhanced NF-kappa B activity. Thus, the loss of PRMT2 is causally linked to impaired atherosclerosis regression via a heightened inflammatory response in macrophages. That PRMT2 expression was lower in myeloid cells in plaques from human subjects with diabetes supports the relevance of our findings to human atherosclerosis.",

INTERSTELLAR first identifies sequence segments encoded in reads according to the users definition. Followed by error correction, values are extracted and compressed into an optimal space, which can be efficiently translated into sequencing reads of another structure. We demonstrated that INTERSTELLAR successfully extracted information from a range of sequencing reads and translated those of single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, scATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics to be analyzed by different software tools that have been developed for conceptually the same types of experiments.

Both approaches, however, suffer from various shortcomings and pitfalls. In this paper, we present \"rox\", a novel statistical model for the analysis of omics data with missing values without the need for imputation. The model directly incorporates missing values as \"low\" concentrations into the calculation.

    "abstract": "Biobank projects around the world are generating genomic data for many thousands and even millions of individuals. Computational methods are needed to handle these massive data sets, including tools for genetic ancestry (GA) inference. Current methods for GA inference are generally accurate, but they are slow and do not scale to biobank-size genomic datasets. Here we present Rye - a new algorithm for GA inference at biobank scale. We compare the accuracy and runtime performance of Rye to the widely used RFMix and ADMIXTURE programs, and we apply it to a dataset of 488,221 genome-wide variant samples from the UK Biobank. Rye infers GA based on principal component analysis (PCA) of genomic variant samples from ancestral reference populations and query individuals. The algorithms accuracy is powered by Metropolis-Hastings optimization and its speed is provided by non-negative least squares (NNLS) regression. Rye produces highly accurate GA estimates for three-way admixed populations - African, European, and Native American - compared to RFMix and ADMIXTURE (R2 = 0.998 - 1.00), and shows 50x runtime improvement compared to ADMIXTURE on the UK Biobank dataset. Rye analysis of UK Biobank samples demonstrates how it can be used to infer GA at different levels of relatedness. We discuss user consideration and options for the use of Rye; the program and its documentation are distributed on the GitHub repository: https://github.com/healthdisparities/rye.",

Long-read technologies now bring the potential to improve the quality of transcriptome annotation. Consequently, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) are probably the most benefited class of transcripts that would have improved annotation using this novel technology. However, there is a gap regarding benchmarking studies that highlighted if the direct use of lncRNA predictors in long-reads makes more precise identification of these transcripts.

The most prominent model of early endosomal maturation involves phosphoinositide-driven gain or loss of specific proteins on individual endosomes, emphasising an autonomous and stochastic description. However, limitations in fast, volumetric imaging long hindered direct whole-cell measurements of absolute numbers of maturation events. Here, we use lattice light-sheet imaging and bespoke automated analysis to track individual very early (APPL1-positive) and early (EEA1-positive) endosomes over the entire population, demonstrating that direct interendosomal contact drives maturation. Using fluorescence lifetime, we show that this interaction is underpinned by asymmetric EEA1 binding to very early and early endosomes through its N- and C-termini, respectively. In combination with agent-based simulation that confirms a  trigger-and-convert model, our findings indicate that APPL1-to EEA1-positive maturation is driven not by autonomous events but by heterotypic EEA1-mediated interactions, providing a mechanism for temporal and population-level control of maturation.",

    "abstract": "Opioid use is detrimental to bone health, causing both indirect and direct effects on bone turnover. While the mechanisms of these effects are not entirely clear, recent studies have linked chronic opioid use to alterations in circulating miRNAs. Our aim was to develop a model of opioid-induced bone loss to understand bone turnover and identify candidate miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms. We evaluated the effects of sustained morphine treatment on the skeleton, metabolism, and body composition of male and female C57BL/6J mice by treating with vehicle (0.9% saline) or morphine (18 mg/kg) using subcutaneous osmotic minipumps for 25 days. Morphine-treated mice had higher energy expenditure and respiratory quotient, indicating a shift toward carbohydrate metabolism. Microcomputed tomography ({micro}CT) analysis indicated that male mice treated with morphine had reduced trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV) (15%) and Tb. bone mineral density (BMD) (14%) in the distal femur compared to vehicle. Conversely, bone microarchitecture was not changed in females after morphine treatment. Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that in males, morphine reduced bone formation rate compared to vehicle, but osteoclast parameters were not different. Furthermore, morphine reduced bone formation marker gene expression in the tibia of males (Bglap and Dmp1). Circulating miRNA profile changes were evident in males, with 14 differentially expressed miRNAs associated with morphine treatment. Target analysis indicated hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) signaling pathway was targeted by miR-223-3p and fatty acid metabolism by miR-484, - 223-3p, and -328-3p. In summary, we have established a model where morphine leads to a lower trabecular bone formation in males. Further, understanding the mechanisms of bone loss from opioid treatment will be important for improving management of the adverse effects of opioids on the skeleton.",

Dynamic imaging of plant roots is important in order to discover novel root growth behaviors and to deepen our understanding of how roots interact with their environments. We designed and implemented the Generating Rhizodynamic Observations Over Time (GROOT) robot, an automated, high-throughput imaging system that enables time-lapse imaging of 90 containers of plants and their roots growing in a clear gel medium over the duration of weeks to months. The system uses low-cost, widely available materials. As a proof of concept, we employed GROOT to collect images of orchid root growth of multiple species over six months. Beyond imaging plant roots, our system is highly customizable and can be used to collect time-lapse image data of different container sizes and configurations regardless of what is being imaged, making it applicable to many fields that require longitudinal time-lapse recording.",

However, by focusing on the most preserved homeostasis systems between species and models, novel disease dimensions can be unearthed. We interrogated core liver gene co-expression networks in a mouse model of liver cancer following dietary challenge. Immunometabolic modules showed temporal changes under the influence of diet duration and aging. The behaviour of immune network in tumours mirrored their counterparts in non-tumour liver. A high immune response network was associated with a lower tumour burden in mice and humans. This module in mice was enriched for genes related to haematopoietic cell differentiation. Consistently, the bone marrow haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells response was reflective of the liver immune response. Linking haematopoiesis to hepatic homeostasis uncovers a hitherto unexplored dimension of tissue crosstalk that can inform pathogenesis.",

Dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) is sufficient and necessary for aversive learning and has been linked to both anxiety and stress disorder symptomatology. Thus, understanding how dopamine controls associative learning in response to aversive stimuli is critical to understanding the role of dopamine in behavior in health and disease.\n\nMethodsUsing an optical dopamine sensor combined with in-vivo fiber photometry in the NAc core of male and female C57BL/6J mice (N=38), we recorded dopamine responses to expected and omitted aversive outcomes during learning. We derived predictions from a theory-driven model of associative learning (Kutlu-Calipari-Schmajuk, KCS model) and tested the causality of these predictions using optogenetics.\n\nResultsDopamine release was evoked by the predicted omission of aversive stimuli in a fashion that cannot be explained by dopamine as a reward-based prediction signal. The magnitude of the dopamine response during omissions scaled with predictions about the probability of their occurrence; however, dopamine did not track the associative value of predictive cues. Finally, we showed that the observed effects are causal to learned behavior and can only be explained by dopamine signaling the perceived saliency of predicted aversive events.\n\nConclusionsWe elucidate the role of NAc core dopamine signaling in aversive learning in a theory-based and stimulus-specific fashion and offer potential avenues for understanding the neural mechanisms involved in anxiety and stress disorders.",

    "abstract": "Despite the higher prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women, the majority of preclinical neuroscience research has been conducted utilizing male subjects. We have found that male rats exposed to the predator scent 2,4,5-trimethyl-3-thiazoline (TMT) show heterogenous development of long-term anxiety-like behavior and conditioned fear to the TMT environment. Stress-Resilient males exhibit increased mGlu5 mRNA expression in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and prefrontal cortex. Here we sought to determine whether the same behavioral and genetic responses would be observed in female rats exposed to TMT. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to TMT for ten minutes, while Controls were exposed to an unscented environment. Anxiety and anhedonia were assessed 7-14 days later with elevated plus maze (EPM), acoustic startle response (ASR), light/dark box, and sucrose preference test. TMT-exposed females spent less time in the EPM open arms and exhibited greater startle amplitude, and reduced sucrose intake compared to Controls. Median split analyses conducted on EPM and sucrose intake yielded phenotypes that displayed behavior in the light/dark box consistent with EPM and sucrose testing. Unlike male Susceptible rats, female Susceptible rats showed no freezing when re-exposed to the TMT context, nor did Resilient female rats present elevated BLA mGlu5 mRNA levels. Instead, Susceptible females had greater BLA mGlu5 than Resilient or Control rats. This work indicates that, as in humans, rats exhibit sex-dependent responses to stress. This translational animal model may provide insight into how females are uniquely affected by PTSD.",

    "abstract": "Power laws arise in a variety of phenomena ranging from matter undergoing phase transition to the distribution of word frequencies in the English language. Usually, their presence is only apparent when data is abundant, and accurately determining their exponents often requires even larger amounts of data. As the scale of recordings in neuroscience becomes larger, an increasing number of studies attempt to characterise potential power-law relationships in neural data. In this paper, we aim to discuss the potential pitfalls that one faces in such efforts and to promote a Bayesian interpolation framework for this purpose. We apply this framework to synthetic data and to data from a recent study of large-scale recordings in mouse primary visual cortex (V1), where the exponent of a powerlaw scaling in the data played an important role: its value was argued to determine whether the populations stimulus-response relationship is smooth, and experimental data was provided to confirm that this is indeed so. Our analysis shows that with such data types and sizes as we consider here, the best-fit values found for the parameters of the power law and the uncertainty for these estimates are heavily dependent on the noise model assumed for the estimation, the range of the data chosen, and (with all other things being equal) the particular recordings. It is thus challenging to offer a reliable statement about the exponents of the power law. Our analysis, however, shows that this does not affect the conclusions regarding the smoothness of the population response to low-dimensional stimuli but casts doubt on those to natural images. We discuss the implications of this result for the neural code in the V1 and offer the approach discussed here as a framework that future studies, perhaps exploring larger ranges of data, can employ as their starting point to examine power-law scalings in neural data.",

    "abstract": "Persistent activity is thought to mediate working memory. While such stimulus evoked persistence is well studied, mechanisms of internally generated or spontaneous persistence in vivo are unknown. Further, current theories based on attractor dynamics focus on elevated activity as a memory substrate, while little attention has focused on the role of inactivity attractors. Here, we present a mean field model of functional interaction between large cortical networks that predicts both spontaneous persistent activity (SPA) and inactivity (SPI); the latter has never been seen before in experiments or models. We confirm these predictions using simultaneously recorded neocortical local field potential (LFP) and the membrane potential (Vm) of identified excitatory neurons from several brain areas in vivo during slow oscillations, especially from layer 3 of the medial (MECIII) and lateral entorhinal cortex (LECIII), which show SPA and SPI. By matching model and experimental statistics, we predict the relative strength of internal and external excitation in the LECIII and MECIII networks. Our predictions match anatomical data. Further, the model predicts, and the experiments confirm, that SPA and SPI are quantized by cortical UDS and follow the statistics of a history dependent Bernoulli process. These convergent, theory-experiment results thus reveal the differential nature of cortico-entorhinal functional connectivity, resulting in a unique pattern of persistent activity and persistent inactivity, a novel and energetically efficient memory substrate.",

Closed-loop acoustic stimuli applied during four SO phases always acutely increased sharp wave ripple (SPWR) activity without disrupting non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Stimulation achieved an above chance preference index for stimuli delivered across a 3 h retention interval of sleep at the SO Up-state and at the Down-to-Up-state, but not at the Down-state nor late Up-state/Up-to Down-state.

They suggest that the damage to brain tissue by laser could not be caused by thermal effects but rather by plasma-mediated chemical effects. To quantify the thermal accumulation due to the fs laser illumination in living animals, we used a thermocouple sensor to measure the temperature change in the vicinity of the laser focus at a depth of 300 m in the adult mouse cortex. Our results show that at 930 nm wavelength, 25 m from the laser focus, 19-300 mW laser can all lead to a brain tissue temperature rise of more than 0.3 K at 1 second and the maximum equilibrium temperature rise of more than 28 K. These experimental measurements are significantly higher than theoretically calculated values in the comment. These results suggest that the thermal accumulation effect of focused low-energy pulses from fs laser oscillators could contribute significantly to the collateral damage in the living brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEpilepsy is a very invalidating pathology characterized by the unpredictable appearance of abnormal cerebral activity leading to seizures and co-morbidities. The ability to detect and even predict seizures is a major challenge and many research laboratories are using rodents models of epilepsy to unravel possible mechanisms. The gold standard to record and detect seizures is electroencephalography, but it is very invasive. For rodents used in research, video analysis is a very interesting approach but the major disadvantages are that it is time consuming, prone to human error, and not very reproducible. Commercial solutions for detailed phenotyping analysis on humans or rodents exist but they are costly. Some open source software programs are also available, they provide very interesting and precise behavior data, but none of them are made for high throughput analysis of a large number of video files generated by long lasting recordings.\n\nNew methodWe developed an open-source python-based package of two software programs that enable automated video acquisition and simple motion analysis associated with a spectral power analysis, which enable a semi-automated identification of convulsive seizures. The method needs cheap webcams and a computer or a server.\n\nResultsUsing two murine epilepsy models (Nav1.1 mutations), we have compared our motion analysis software to human visual inspection and found an 88.8% accuracy in convulsive seizures detection. We then compare our method to the gold standard electrocorticogram analysis and found a 93.2% accuracy. The motion analysis is also interesting to get a readout of the animal activity without the invasiveness of electromyogram recordings.\n\nConclusionsThis new method is easy to use, cost-effective and allows: 1) detection of convulsive seizures in a noninvasive way, 2) high speed analysis of a large number of video files with a good accuracy, and 3) automated acquisition and semi-automated analysis of a very large number of files.\n\nHighlightsO_LINoninvasive semi-automated detection of convulsive seizures from videos\nC_LIO_LIHigh speed of analysis with a good accuracy\nC_LIO_LIAbility to acquire and analyze a very large number of files\nC_LIO_LIEasy to use graphical interfaces\nC_LIO_LICost-effective setup\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Oscillatory activity in the human brain is dominated by posterior alpha oscillations (8-14 Hz), which have been shown to be functionally relevant in a wide variety of cognitive tasks. Although posterior alpha oscillations are commonly considered a single oscillator anchored at an individual alpha frequency (IAF; [~]10 Hz), previous work suggests that IAF reflects a spatial mixture of different brain rhythms. In this study, we assess whether Independent Component Analysis (ICA) can disentangle functionally distinct posterior alpha rhythms in the context of visual short-term memory retention. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded in 33 subjects while performing a visual working memory task. Group analysis at sensor level suggested the existence of a single posterior alpha oscillator that increases in power and decreases in frequency during memory retention. Conversely, single-subject analysis of independent components revealed the existence of two dissociable alpha rhythms: one that increases in power during memory retention (Alpha1) and another one that decreases in power (Alpha2). Alpha1 and Alpha2 rhythms were differentially modulated by the presence of visual distractors (Alpha1 increased in power while Alpha2 decreased) and had an opposite relationship with accuracy (positive for Alpha1 and negative for Alpha2). In addition, Alpha1 rhythms showed a lower peak frequency, a narrower peak width, a greater relative peak amplitude and a more central source than Alpha2 rhythms. Together, our results demonstrate that modulations in posterior alpha oscillations during short-term memory retention reflect the dynamics of at least two distinct brain rhythms with different functions and spatiospectral characteristics.\n\nSignificance statementAlpha oscillations are the most prominent feature of the human brains electrical activity, and consist of rhythmic neuronal activity in posterior parts of the cortex. Alpha is usually considered a single brain rhythm that changes in power and frequency to support cognitive operations. We here show that posterior alpha entails at least two dissociable rhythms with distinct functions and characteristics. These findings could solve previous inconsistencies in the literature regarding the direction of task-related alpha power/frequency modulations and their relation to cognitive performance. In addition, the existence of two distinct posterior alpha rhythms could have important consequences for the design of neurostimulation protocols aimed at modulating alpha oscillations and subsequently cognition.",

Specifically, information-based methods based on spectral decoding, information sharing, and information redundancy distinguished odorant identity across spatially distant regions while classical spectral analyses did not.

Further analysis confirms that the computer model with an index confusion was used for fitting the experimental results, running the simulation, and plotting the corresponding figures in the original publication. This paper intends to fix the computer code and additionally create a non-convex optimisation solution for re-calibrating the model. After re-calibration, the revised model outperforms the initial model in accuracy describing the MEP amplitudes of TBS-induced after-effects under specific situations.",

    "abstract": "The human brain extracts meaning from the world using an extensive neural system for semantic knowledge. Whether such broadly distributed systems1-3 crucially depend on or can compensate for the loss of one of their highly interconnected hubs4-6 is controversial4. The strongest level of causal evidence for the role of a brain hub is to evaluate its acute network-level impact following disconnection and any rapid functional compensation that ensues. We report rare neurophysiological data from two patients who underwent awake intracranial recordings during a speech prediction task immediately before and after neurosurgical treatment that required disconnection of the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL), a crucial hub for semantic knowledge4-6. Informed by a predictive coding framework, we tested three sets of hypotheses including diaschisis causing disruption in interconnected sites7 and incomplete or complete compensation by other language-critical and speech processing sites8-10. Immediately after ATL disconnection, we observed highly specific neurophysiological alterations in the recorded fronto-temporal network, including abnormally magnified high gamma responses to the speech sounds in auditory cortex. We also observed evidence for rapid compensation, seen as focal increases in effective connectivity involving language-critical sites in the inferior frontal gyrus and speech processing sites in auditory cortex. However, compensation was incomplete, in part because after ATL disconnection speech prediction signals were depleted in auditory cortex. This study provides direct causal evidence for a semantic hub in the human brain and shows striking neural impact and a rapid attempt at compensation in a neural network after the loss of one of its hubs.",

    "abstract": "Disruption of neural tracts descending from the brain to the spinal cord after brain trauma and stroke causes postural and sensorimotor deficits. We previously showed that unilateral lesion to the sensorimotor cortex in rats with completely transected thoracic spinal cord produced asymmetry in hindlimb posture and withdrawal reflexes. Supraspinal signals to hindlimb muscles may be transmitted through the paravertebral chain of sympathetic ganglia that remain intact after the transection. We here demonstrated that prior transection of the spinal cord at the cervical level that was rostrally to segments with preganglionic sympathetic neurons, did not abolish formation of asymmetry in hindlimb posture and musculo-articular resistance to stretch after unilateral brain injury. Thus not the sympathetic system but humoral signals may mediate the effects of brain injury on the lumbar spinal circuits. The asymmetric responses in rats with transected spinal cords were eliminated by bilateral lumbar dorsal rhizotomy after the left-side brain injury, but resistant to deafferentation after the right-side brain lesion. Two mechanisms, one dependent on and one independent of afferent input may account for asymmetric hindlimb motor responses. Resistance to deafferentation may be due to sustained stretch- and effort-unrelated muscle contractions that is often observed in patients with central lesions. Left-right asymmetry is unusual feature of these mechanisms that both are activated by humoral signals.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/488460v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14770e6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1452343org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e1aedorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c8ea_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Frequency selectivity is a fundamental property of the peripheral auditory system; however, the invasiveness of auditory nerve (AN) experiments limits its study in the human ear. Compound action potentials (CAPs) associated with forward-masking have been suggested as an alternative means to assess cochlear frequency selectivity. Previous methods relied on an empirical comparison of AN and CAP tuning curves in animal models, arguably not taking full advantage of the information contained in forward-masked CAPs. In this work, we seek to provide a direct estimate of the quality factor characterizing AN frequency tuning using many forward-masked CAP responses. The method is based on a convolution model of the CAP that takes into account the masking of AN populations induced by notched-noise maskers with various notch widths and attenuations. The model produces masking patterns that, once convolved by a unitary response, predict forward-masked CAP waveforms. Model parameters, including those characterizing frequency selectivity, are fine-tuned by minimizing waveform prediction errors across the different masking conditions, yielding robust estimates. The method was applied to click-evoked CAPs at the round window of anesthetized chinchillas. The estimated quality factor Q10 as a function of center frequency is shown to closely match the average quality factor obtained from AN-fiber tuning curves, without the need for an empirical correction factor. Beyond the estimation of frequency selectivity, the proposed model proves to be accurate in predicting forward-masked CAP responses, and therefore could be extended to study more complex aspects of cochlear signal processing using a similar experimental approach.",

CbpD was recently shown to be a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase active on chitin, and to contribute substantially to virulence. To-date no structure of this virulence factor has been reported. Its first two domains are homologous to those found in the crystal structure of Vibrio cholerae GbpA, while the third domain is homologous to the NMR structure of the Cellvibrio japonicus CjLPMO10A CBM73 domain. We report the 3.0 [A] resolution crystal structure of CbpD solved by molecular replacement, which required ab initio models of each CbpD domain generated by the artificial intelligence deep learning structure prediction algorithm RoseTTAFold. The structure of CbpD confirms previously postulated chitin-specific motifs in the AA10 domain while challenging the deterministic effects of other postulated substrate specificity motifs. Additionally, the structure of CbpD shows that post translational modifications occur on the chitin binding surface. Moreover, the structure raises interesting possibilities about how Type 2 Secretion System substrates may interact with the secretion machinery and demonstrates the utility of new artificial intelligence protein structure prediction algorithms in making challenging structural targets tractable.",

There is still much to learn about the rubella virus (RUBV) papain-like protease (RubPro) that could be a potential drug target. This protease is crucial to RUBV replication, cleaving the non-structural polyprotein p200 into 2 multi-functional proteins, p150 and p90. Here we report a novel crystal structure of RubPro at 1.64 [A] resolution. It has a similar catalytic core structure to that of SARS-CoV-2 and foot-mouth-disease virus (FMDV) proteases. RubPro has well-conserved sequence motifs that are also found in its newly discovered Rubivirus relatives. The RubPro construct was shown to have protease activity in trans against a construct of RUBV protease-helicase and fluorogenic peptide. A protease-helicase construct was also cleaved in E. coli expression. RubPro was demonstrated to possess deubiquitylation activity, suggesting a potential role of RubPro in modulating the hosts innate immune responses. The structural and functional insights of the RubPro will advance our current understanding of its function and point to more structure-based research into the RUBV replication machinery, in hopes of developing antiviral therapeutics in the future.",

    "abstract": "Mice are frequently used as animal models for mechanistic studies of infection and obstetrical disease, yet characterization of the murine microbiota during pregnancy is lacking. The objective of this study was to therefore characterize the microbiotas of distinct body sites of the pregnant mouse that harbor microorganisms that could potentially invade the murine amniotic cavity leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes: vagina, oral cavity, intestine, and lung. The microbiotas of these body sites were characterized through anoxic, hypoxic, and oxic culture, as well as through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. With the exception of the vagina, the cultured microbiotas of each body site varied with atmosphere, with the greatest diversity in the cultured microbiota appearing under anoxic conditions. Only cultures of the vagina were able to recapitulate the microbiota observed from direct DNA sequencing of body site samples, primarily due to the dominance of two Rodentibacter strains. Identified as R. pneumotropicus and R. heylii, these isolates exhibited dominance patterns similar to those of Lactobacillus crispatus and L. iners in the human vagina. Whole genome sequencing of these Rodentibacter strains revealed shared genomic features, including the ability to degrade glycogen, an abundant polysaccharide in the vagina. In summary, we report body site specific microbiotas in the pregnant mouse with potential ecological parallels to those of humans. Importantly, our findings indicate that the vaginal microbiota of pregnant mice can be readily cultured, suggesting that mock vaginal microbiotas can be tractably generated and maintained for experimental manipulation in future mechanistic studies of host vaginal-microbiome interactions.\n\nIMPORTANCEMice are widely utilized as animal models of obstetrical complications; however, the characterization of the murine microbiota has been neglected during pregnancy. Microorganisms from the vagina, oral cavity, intestine, and lung have been found in the intra-amniotic space, where their presence threatens the progression of gestation. Herein, we characterize the microbiotas of pregnant mice and establish the appropriateness of culture in capturing the microbiota at each site. The high relative abundance of Rodentibacter observed in the vagina is similar to that of Lactobacillus in humans, suggesting potential ecological parallels. Importantly, we report that the vaginal microbiota of the pregnant mouse can be readily cultured under hypoxic conditions, demonstrating that mock microbial communities can be utilized to test the potential ecological parallels between microbiotas in human and murine pregnancy, and to evaluate the relevance of the structure of these microbiotas for adverse pregnancy outcomes, especially intra-amniotic infection and spontaneous preterm birth.",

    "abstract": "Cadmium (Cd) as a heavy metal causes serious environmental pollution and multiple organ and system damage in human. However, little is known about the specific molecular mechanisms of the associated regulatory networks. In this study, we selected Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) to investigate the effects of Cd exposure as it acts as an acknowledged and established genetic model organism. A total of 26 differentially-expressed circular RNA (DEcircRNAs), 143 lncRNAs (DElncRNAs), 69 microRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 6209 mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were found and identified, which might influence reproductive function, aging processes and nervous system functions through regulating the levels of circRNAs and lncRNAs and the controlling of regulatory networks of circRNA/lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA. Based on quantitative PCR, four DEcircRNAs and three DElncRNAs were confirmed to have different expression levels between the Cd-treated and control group. Further, 5 protein-coding genes might be regulated by DElnRNAs through cis-acting and 114 by trans-acting elements. Additionally, 42 differentially regulative phosphopeptides were detected and 4 novel pairs of transcription factors (TFs)-kinase-substrate that might be influenced by Cd exposure were constructed by phosphoproteomics. Our findings suggest that Cd might influence multi-functions and the aging process of C. elegans and may inhibit the expression of TFs to reduce phosphorylated levels of the corresponding protein.\n\nSynopsisCadmium exists widely in soil, water and air.

    "abstract": "Background & AimsRET receptor tyrosine kinase is necessary for enteric nervous system (ENS) development. Loss-of-function RET mutations cause Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), in which infants are born with aganglionic bowel. Despite surgical correction, HSCR patients often experience chronic defecatory dysfunction and enterocolitis, suggesting that RET is important after development. To test this hypothesis, we determined the location of postnatal RET and its significance in gastrointestinal (GI) motility.\n\nMethodsRetCFP/+ mice and human transcriptional profiling data were studied to identify the enteric neuronal and epithelial cells that express RET. To determine whether RET signaling in these cells regulates adult gut motility in vivo, genetic and pharmacologic approaches were used to disrupt RET in either all RET-expressing cells, a major subset of enteric neurons, or intestinal epithelial cells.\n\nResultsDistinct subsets of enteric neurons and enteroendocrine cells expressed RET in the adult intestine. RET disruption in the intestinal epithelium, rather than in enteric neurons, slowed GI motility selectively in adult male mice. This effect was phenocopied by RET kinase inhibition. Most RET+ epithelial cells were either enterochromaffin cells that release serotonin (5-HT) or L-cells that release peptide YY (PYY), both of which can alter motility. RET kinase inhibition exaggerated PYY release in a nutrient-dependent manner without altering 5-HT secretion. PYY receptor blockade fully rescued dysmotility in mice lacking epithelial RET.\n\nConclusionRET signaling normally limits nutrient-dependent PYY release from L-cells and this activity is necessary for normal intestinal motility in male mice. These effects could contribute to post-operative dysmotility in HSCR, which predominantly affects males, and uncovers a mechanism that could be targeted to treat post-prandial GI dysfunction.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/488514v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (24K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4c8e83org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@204d13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a429d8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b75265_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are an attractive model for understanding the relationship between cell signaling and cell fates. Cultured mouse ESCs can exist in multiple cell states resembling distinct stages of early embryogenesis, such as Totipotent, Pluripotent, Primed and Primitive Endoderm. The signaling mechanisms regulating the Totipotent state acquisition and coexistence of these states are poorly understood. Here we identify BMP4 as an inducer of the Totipotent state. However, we discovered that BMP4-mediated induction of the Totipotent state is constrained by the cross-activation of FGF, TGF-{beta} and WNT pathways. We exploited this finding to enhance the proportion of Totipotent cells in ESCs by rationally inhibiting these cross-activated pathways using small molecules. Single-cell mRNA-sequencing further revealed that induction of the Totipotent state is accompanied by the suppression of both the Primed and Primitive Endoderm states. Furthermore, the reprogrammed Totipotent cells generated in culture have a molecular and functional resemblance to Totipotent cell stages of preimplantation embryos. Our findings reveal a novel BMP4 signaling mechanism in ESCs to regulate multiple cell states, potentially significant for managing stem cell heterogeneity in differentiation and reprogramming.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVascular endothelial cells are a mesoderm-derived lineage with many essential functions, including angiogenesis and coagulation. However, the gene regulatory mechanisms that underpin endothelial specialization are largely unknown, as are the roles of 3D chromatin organization in regulating endothelial cell transcription.\n\nMethodsTo investigate the relationships between 3D chromatin organization and gene expression in endothelial cell differentiation, we induced endothelial cell differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells and performed Hi-C and RNA-seq assays at specific timepoints in differentiation.\n\nResultsOur analyses reveal that long-range intrachromosomal contacts increase over the course of endothelial cell differentiation, as do genomic compartment transitions between active and inactive states. These compartmental states are tightly associated with endothelial transcription. Dynamic topologically associating domain (TAD) boundaries strengthen and converge on an endothelial cell state, and nascent TAD boundaries are linked to the expression of genes that support endothelial cell specification. Relatedly, chromatin pairwise point interactions (DNA loops) increase in frequency during differentiation and are linked to the expression of genes with essential roles in vascular biology, including MECOM, TFPI, and KDR. To identify forms of regulation specific to endothelial cell differentiation, we compared the functional chromatin dynamics of endothelial cells with those of developing cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes exhibit greater long-range cis interactions than endothelial cells, whereas endothelial cells have increased local intra-TAD interactions and much more abundant pairwise point interactions.\n\nConclusionsGenome topology changes dynamically during endothelial differentiation, including acquisition of long-range cis interactions and new TAD boundaries, interconversion of hetero- and euchromatin, and formation of DNA loops. These chromatin dynamics guide transcription in the development of endothelial cells and promote the divergence of endothelial cells from related cell types such as cardiomyocytes.",

Beyond the universal observation that most species are rare and only a few common, more-precise description of SAD shape is controversial. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind SADs and how they vary along environmental gradients remain unresolved. We lack a general non-neutral theory of SADs. Here we develop a trait-based framework, focusing on a local community coupled to the region by dispersal. The balance of immigration and exclusion determines abundances, which vary over orders-of-magnitude. Under stabilizing selection, the local trait-abundance distribution (TAD) reflects a transformation of the regional TAD. The left-tail of the SAD depends on scaling exponents of the exclusion function and the regional species pool. More-complex local dynamics can lead to multimodal TADs and SADs. Connecting SADs with trait-based ecological theory provides a way to generate more-testable hypotheses on the controls over commonness and rarity in communities.",

    "abstract": "Island ecosystems provide models to assess the impacts of isolation on population persistence. However, most studies of persistence have focused on a single species, without comparisons to other organisms they interact with in the ecosystem. The simple predator-prey system of moose and gray wolves on Isle Royale provides allows a direct contrast of genetic variation in a prey species with their natural predator. Wolves on Isle Royale exhibited signs of severe inbreeding depression, which nearly drove the population to extinction in 2019. In the relative absence of wolves, the moose population has thrived and exhibits no obvious signs of inbreeding depression despite being isolated for [~]120 years and having low genetic diversity. Here, we examine the genomic underpinnings of population persistence in the Isle Royale moose population. We document high levels of inbreeding in the population, roughly as high as the wolf population at the time of its decline. However, inbreeding in the moose population manifests in the form of intermediate-length runs of homozygosity indicative of gradual inbreeding, contrasting with the severe recent inbreeding observed in the wolf population. Using simulations, we demonstrate that this more gradual inbreeding in the moose population has resulted in an estimated 50% purging of the inbreeding load, helping to explain the continued persistence of the population. However, we also document notable increases in genetic load, which could eventually threaten population viability over the long term. Finally, we document low diversity in mainland North American moose populations due to a severe founder event occurring near the end of the Holocene. Overall, our results demonstrate a complex relationship between inbreeding, genetic diversity, and population viability that highlights the importance of maintaining isolated populations at moderate size to avert extinction from genetic factors.\n\nSignificance statementIsolated wildlife populations face a high risk of extinction due in part to the deleterious consequences of inbreeding. Whether purifying natural selection can overcome these negative impacts by \"purging\" harmful recessive mutations is a topic of active debate. We characterized the extent of purging in an isolated moose population. Our results demonstrate signatures of gradual inbreeding in the population, ideal circumstances to facilitate purging. Using simulations, we demonstrate substantial potential for purging in the population, though we also show that fitness is reduced by small population size and inbreeding. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms enabling persistence in isolated populations, with implications for conserving the growing number of isolated populations worldwide.",

    "abstract": "Division of labour occurs in a broad range of organisms. Yet, how division of labour can emerge in the absence of pre-existing interindividual differences is poorly understood. Using a simple but realistic model, we show that in a group of initially identical individuals, division of labour emerges spontaneously if returning foragers share part of their resources with other group members. In the absence of resource sharing, individuals follow an activity schedule of alternating between foraging and other tasks. If non-foraging individuals are fed by other individuals, their alternating activity schedule becomes interrupted, leading to task specialisation and the emergence of division of labour. Furthermore, nutritional differences between individuals reinforce division of labour. Such differences can be caused by increased metabolic rates during foraging or by dominance interactions during resource sharing. Our model proposes a plausible mechanism for the self-organised emergence of division of labour in animal groups of initially identical individuals. This mechanism could also play a role for the emergence of division of labour during the major evolutionary transitions to eusociality and multicellularity.",

In this study, we examined the role of neural modulation and metabolism in constitutive and experience-dependent differences in defensive response. We compared brain gene expression in bees of identified gentle and defensive colonies in a standard assay. For neuromodulation, we examined membrane receptor genes for the biogenic amines dopamine (DOPR2), octopamine (OAR), and serotonin (5HT2a), and the enzyme gene in the synthesis pathway (THR). To examine neural metabolism, we assessed the Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway \"OXPHOS\" gene expression (i.e., ND51 and ND20-LIKE). Bees of defensive colonies had a significantly lower expression of amine receptor, synthesis genes, and OXPHOS genes. Experience differences or exposure to nociceptive neurons activated by nocive stimuli (electric shock) led to differences in the expression of all genes except 5HT2a. The same target genes demonstrated an increase in expression levels after electric shock and sting response. We discuss the convergence of neuromodulation, neural metabolism",

While testis histology is already an invaluable tool for identifying and describing developmental differences in evolution and disease, methods for standardized, digital image analysis of testis are needed to expand the utility of this approach.\n\nResultsWe developed SATINN (Software for Analysis of Testis Images with Neural Networks), a multi-level framework for automated analysis of multiplexed immunofluorescence images from mouse testis. This approach uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify nuclei from seminiferous tubules into 7 distinct cell types with an accuracy of 94.2%. These cell classifications are then used in a second-level tubule CNN, which places seminiferous tubules into one of 7 distinct tubule stages with 90.4% accuracy. We further describe numerous cell- and tubule-level statistics that can be derived from wildtype testis. Finally, we demonstrate how the classifiers and derived statistics can be used to rapidly and precisely describe pathology by applying our methods to image data from two mutant mouse lines. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and potential of using computer-assisted analysis for testis histology, an area poised to evolve rapidly on the back of emerging, spatially-resolved genomic and proteomic technologies.\n\nAvailability and implementationScripts to apply the methods described here are available from http://github.com/conradlab/SATINN.",

Although A{beta} deposits have been mostly observed extracellularly, various studies have reported the presence of also intracellular A{beta} assemblies. Because these intracellular A{beta} aggregates might play a role in the onset and progression of Alzheimers disease, it is important to investigate their possible origins at different locations of the cell along the secretory pathway of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), from which A{beta} is derived by proteolytic cleavage. Since lipid bilayers have been shown to promote the aggregation of A{beta}, in this study we measure the effects of the lipid membrane composition on the in vitro aggregation kinetics of the 42-residue form of A{beta} (A{beta}42). By using small unilamellar vesicles modelling cellular membranes at different locations, including the inner and outer leaflets of the plasma membrane, late endosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the Golgi apparatus, we show that A{beta}42 aggregation is inhibited by the ER and Golgi membranes. These results provide a preliminary map of the possible effects of the membrane composition in different cellular locations on A{beta} aggregation, and suggest the presence of an evolutionary optimization of lipid composition to prevent the intracellular aggregation of A{beta}.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) is a common technique to analyze the turnover of molecules in living cells. Numerous physicochemical models have been developed to quantitatively evaluate the rate of turnover driven by chemical reaction and diffusion that occurs in a few seconds to minutes. On the other hand, they have limitations in interpreting long-term FRAP responses where intracellular active movement inevitably provides target molecular architectures with additional effects other than chemical reaction and diffusion, namely directed transport and structural deformation. To overcome the limitations, we develop a continuum mechanics-based model that allows for decoupling FRAP response into the intrinsic turnover rate and subcellular mechanical characteristics such as displacement vector and strain tensor. Our approach was validated using fluorescently-labeled beta-actin in an actomyosin-mediated contractile apparatus called stress fibers, revealing spatially distinct patterns of the multi-physicochemical events, in which the turnover rate of beta-actin was significantly higher at the center of the cell. We also found that the turnover rate is negatively correlated with the strain rate along stress fibers but, interestingly, not with the absolute strain magnitude. Moreover, stress fibers are subjected to centripetal flow as well as both contractile and tensile strains along them. Taken together, this novel framework for long-term FRAP analysis allows for unveiling the contribution of overlooked microscopic mechanics to molecular turnover in living cells.",

Our all-atom molecular dynamics simulations resolve this discrepancy for highly curved fusion pores, similar to those found in the nascent fusion and terminal fission steps of endo-/exocytosis. We find that cholesterol is strongly excluded by bilayer thinning in the fusion pore neck, which is caused by the necks net negative Gaussian (saddle) curvature. Consistent with experiment and our fusion pore simulations, analysis of liquid-disordered planar bilayers indicates that cholesterol prefers overall thicker bilayers, but negative leaflet curvature. The exclusion of cholesterol from the neck because of saddle Gaussian curvature implies that it helps drive fusion pore closure, consistent with literature evidence that membrane reshaping is connected to lateral phase separation.",

The carboxy-terminal tail (CTT) is key to regulation and harbors multiple phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr residues 380-385). CTT phosphorylation suppresses the phosphatase activity by inducing a stable, closed conformation. However, little is known about the mechanisms of phosphorylation-induced CTT-deactivation dynamics. Using explicit solvent microsecond molecular dynamics simulations, we show that CTT phosphorylation leads to a partially collapsed conformation, which alters the secondary structure of PTEN and induces long-range conformational rearrangements that encompass the active site. The active site rearrangements prevent localization of PTEN to the membrane, precluding lipid phosphatase activity. Notably, we have identified phosphorylation-induced allosteric coupling between the interdomain region and a hydrophobic site neighboring the active site in the phosphatase domain. Collectively, the results provide a mechanistic understanding of CTT phosphorylation dynamics and reveal potential druggable allosteric sites in a previously believed clinically undruggable protein.",

    "abstract": "In-cell protein crystallization (ICPC) has attracted attention as a next-generation structural biology tool because it does not require multistep purification processes and large-scale crystallization screenings. However, significant issues remain to be solved in context of obtaining various protein crystals in sufficient amounts and quality for structure determination by ICPC. Here, we report the development of cell-free protein crystallization (CFPC), a direct protein crystallization technique which uses cell-free protein synthesis. The most crucial advantages of CFPC are that the reaction scale and time can be minimized and that various reagents can be added during the reaction. We obtained high-quality nano-sized polyhedra crystals, which are produced in insect cells by infection with cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus, at a 200 L reaction scale within 6 h. We applied this technology to structure determination of crystalline inclusion protein A (CipA) by suppressing twin crystal formation with addition of an inhibitor to the reaction solution. We succeeded in determining a 2.11 [A] resolution structure from the nanocrystals of CipA. This technology, which integrates in-cell and in vitro crystallizations significantly expands the tools available for high throughput protein structure determination, particularly in context of unstable, low-yield, or substrate-binding proteins, which are difficult to analyze by conventional methods.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common type of primary brain tumor with an aggressive clinical course, and one of the cornerstones in its treatment regimen is radiotherapy. However, tumor cells surviving after radiation is an indicator of treatment failure; therefore, better understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating radiotherapy response is of utmost importance. In this study, we generated multiple clinically relevant irradiation exposed models, where we applied fractionated radiotherapy over a long period of time and selected irradiation-survivor (IR-Surv) glioblastoma cell populations. In these cells, we examined the transcriptomic alterations, cell cycle and growth rate changes as well as responses to secondary radiotherapy and DNA damage response (DDR) modulators. Accordingly, IR-Surv cells exhibited slower growth and partly retained their ability to resist secondary irradiation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that IR-Surv cells upregulated the expression of DDR-related genes, such as CHK1, ATM, ATR, MGMT, and had better DNA repair capacity as an adaptive mechanism. Separately, we report IR-Surv cells to display downregulation of hypoxic signature and the lower induction of hypoxia target genes and not exhibiting the same level of hypoxia-induced changes with naive glioblastoma cells, as gauged by exposing cells to different hypoxia conditions. We also showed that Chk1 inhibition alone or in combination with irradiation significantly reduces cell viability in both naive and IR-Surv cells. However, IR-Surv cells were markedly less sensitive to Chk1 inhibition under hypoxic conditions. In conclusion, consistent with previous reports, we demonstrate the utility of combining DDR inhibitors and irradiation as a successful approach for both naive and IR-Surv glioblastoma cells as long as cells are refrained from hypoxic conditions. Thus, our findings with clinically relevant radiation survivor models will have future translational implications and benefit the optimization of combination therapies for glioblastoma patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCDK12 inactivation is a predictive biomarker for immune checkpoint blockers (ICB) treatment response in advanced prostate cancer (PCa), but some CDK12-altered patients fail to respond to ICB. Downregulation of MHC expression has been described as a mechanism of intrinsic and acquired resistance to ICB in various cancers, but there is little information on whether MHC expression levels are altered in CDK12 defective PCa that fails to respond to ICB treatments.\n\nMethodsUsing genomics data of primary and metastatic prostate cancer from two public domain cohorts and a retrospective cohort, we investigated variation in the expression of the MHC genes and associated downstream changes in CDK12 mutated patients. The findings of public domain data were validated using transcriptomic data from a 53-patient retrospective cohort from our Institute.\n\nResultsBased on the analysis of gene expression quartiles, we divided the tumors into \"High\" and \"Low\" expression levels of MHC-I and -II. CDK12 defective tumors with increased MHC levels showed the activation of several pathways associated with the immune system and elevated PD-L1, IDO1, and TIM3 expression. These transcriptomic findings were confirmed using expression analyses of our cohort of 53 primary PCa. There was an increased composition of CD8+ T cells, B cells, {gamma}{delta} T cells, and M1 Macrophages in CDK12 mutated tumors with elevated MHC levels based on digital cytometric analyses. In contrast, CDK12 defective tumors with decreased MHC expression were often subject to loss of heterozygosity (LOH) genomic events affecting MHC-I/-II and the HLA gene cluster on chromosome 6. CDK12 defective PCa expresses higher levels of classical MHC, has an active and inflamed tumor microenvironment, and increases the presence of effector T cells.\n\nConclusionsReduced MHC expression may be caused by the acquisition of specific somatic genomic events that reduce the expression of antigen presentation genes. Combining CDK12 mutation, MHC expression levels, and LOH status may better predict outcomes for ICB-eligible PCa. In addition, these findings draw attention to the need to investigate therapeutic approaches for enhancing MHC expression in CDK12 defective PCa to improve ICB responses.",

    "abstract": "While transcription factor C/AAT-enhancer binding protein  (C/EBP) is critical for normal and leukemic differentiation, its role on cell and metabolic homeostasis is largely unknown in cancer. Here, multi-omics analyses uncovered a coordinated activation of C/EBP and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) that increased lipid anabolism in vivo and in patients with FLT3-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Mechanistically, C/EBP regulated FASN-SCD axis to promote fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis and desaturation. We further demonstrated that FLT3 or C/EBP inactivation decreased mono-unsaturated FAs incorporation to membrane phospholipids through SCD downregulation. Consequently, SCD inhibition enhanced susceptibility to lipid redox stress. Moreover, this C/EBP-dependent adaptation of FA homeostasis was exploited by combining FLT3 and glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) inhibition to trigger lipid oxidative stress, enhancing ferroptotic death of FLT3-mutant AML cells. Altogether, our study reveals a C/EBP function in lipid homeostasis and adaptation to redox stress, and a previously unreported vulnerability of FLT3-mutant AML with promising therapeutic application.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe transcription factor C/EBP is as a master regulator of normal and leukemic myeloid differentiation. Here, we discovered that C/EBP regulates fatty acid biosynthesis and metabolic adaptation to redox imbalance in leukemic cells. This confers a vulnerability to lipid oxidative stress to FLT3-mutant cells and supports novel therapeutic opportunities for patients.",

    "abstract": "The circuit mechanism of the thermoregulatory center in the preoptic area (POA) is unknown. Using rats, here we show prostaglandin EP3 receptor-expressing POA neurons (POAEP3R neurons) as a pivotal bidirectional controller in the central thermoregulatory mechanism. POAEP3R neurons are activated in response to elevated ambient temperature, but inhibited by prostaglandin E2, a pyrogenic mediator. Chemogenetic stimulation of POAEP3R neurons at room temperature reduces body temperature by enhancing heat dissipation, whereas inhibition of them elicits hyperthermia involving brown fat thermogenesis, mimicking fever. POAEP3R neurons innervate sympathoexcitatory neurons in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) via tonic inhibitory signaling. Although many POAEP3R neuronal cell bodies express a glutamatergic mRNA marker, paradoxically, their axons in the DMH predominantly contain terminals with GABAergic presynaptic proteins, which are increased by chronic heat exposure. These findings indicate that tonic GABAergic inhibitory signaling from POAEP3R neurons is a fundamental determinant of body temperature for thermal homeostasis and fever.",

    "abstract": "Pitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) is a rare syndromic form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the Transcription Factor 4 (TCF4) gene. TCF4 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is critical for neurodevelopment and brain function through its binding to cis-regulatory elements of target genes. One potential therapeutic strategy for PTHS is to identify dysregulated target genes and normalize their dysfunction. Here, we propose that SCN10A is an important target gene of TCF4 that is an applicable therapeutic approach for PTHS. Scn10a encodes the voltage-gated sodium channel Nav1.8 and is consistently shown to be upregulated in PTHS mouse models. In this perspective, we review prior literature and present novel data that suggests inhibiting Nav1.8 in PTHS mouse models is effective at normalizing neuron function, brain circuit activity and behavioral abnormalities and posit this therapeutic approach as a treatment for PTHS.",

    "abstract": "Drug resistance and tumor relapse in melanoma patients is attributed to a combination of genetic and non-genetic mechanisms. Non-genetic mechanisms of drug resistance commonly involve reversible changes in the cell-state or phenotype, i.e., alterations in molecular profiles that can help cells escape being killed by targeted therapeutics. In melanoma, one of the most common mechanisms of non-genetic resistance is dedifferentiation, which is characterized by loss of melanocytic markers. While various molecular attributes of de-differentiation have been identified, the transition dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we construct cell-state transition landscapes, to quantify the stochastic dynamics driving phenotypic switch in melanoma based on its underlying regulatory network. These landscapes reveal the existence of multiple alternative paths to resistance - de-differentiation and transition to a hyper-pigmented phenotype. Finally, by visualizing the changes in the landscape during in silico molecular perturbations, we identify combinatorial strategies that can lead to the most optimal outcome - a landscape with the minimal occupancy of the two drug-resistant states. Therefore, we present these landscapes as platforms to screen possible therapeutic interventions in terms of their ability to lead to most favourable patient outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Despite the success of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), many patients fail to achieve durable clinical benefit, and the underlying immunological mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated immune reinvigoration by ICB in advanced or recurrent hypermutated or microsatellite instability-high, mismatch repair deficient (MSI-H/MMRd) uterine cancer patients treated with anti-PD-1 (nivolumab). CD8 T cells underwent rapid pharmacodynamic proliferation 2-4 weeks after initiating PD-1 blockade. This immunological response, however, did not correlate with clinical response. We hypothesized that the T cell-intrinsic response to proliferative and genotoxic stress might contribute to the disparity between immunological and clinical response. We developed a high-dimensional single cell cytometric platform to simultaneously analyze T cell differentiation with changes in DNA damage and repair (DDR) pathways. This DDR-Immune platform revealed T cell subset-specific patterns of DDR, and distinct DDR pathways induced by different types of DNA damage. Applying this platform to MSI-H/MMRd or hypermutated uterine cancer patients revealed a signature of DDR exemplified by rapid increase in phosphorylated-ATM (pATM) intrinsic to CD8 T cells proliferating in response to PD-1 blockade that distinguished clinical responders and non-responders. ATM regulated transcriptional circuits in T cells were associated with better clinical response to PD-1 blockade. These findings highlight a previously unrecognized role for CD8 T cell-intrinsic DDR as a potential determinant of immune fitness and clinical outcome of PD-1 blockade therapy.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEUsing high-dimensional immune and DNA damage response (DDR) profiling in T cell subsets we identified distinct signatures in anti-PD-1 treated MSI-H/hypermutated uterine cancer patients associated with clinical response versus non-response. Thus, T cell-intrinsic DDR is a potential determinant of immune responsiveness and clinical outcome to PD-1 blockade therapy in cancer.",

We used sea temperature as a proxy for energy availability. We examined the importance of biogeographic history by comparing the model fits between two taxonomic groups, ground and mackerel sharks, and two geographic regions, the Tropical Atlantic realm and Central Indo-Pacific realm.\n\nResultsThe ELH, temperate-origin model had the best fit to the global dataset and the sub-analyses on ground sharks, mackerel sharks, and the Tropical Atlantic. The NCH temperate-origin model provided the best fit for the Central Indo-Pacific. The {beta} metric of tree symmetry showed the best potential for differentiating between the ELH and NCH models, and the correlation coefficient for temperature vs MRD performed the best at differentiating between temperate and tropical origin of ancestors.\n\nMain ConclusionsThe global and subclade analyses indicate the ELH provides the best explanation for global scale shark diversity gradients even in clades with varying ecology. However, at the realm scale, biogeographic history has an impact on richness patterns. Comparing multiple metrics in relation to a simulation model provides a more rigorous comparison of these models than simple regression fits.",

    "abstract": "The improvement of next-generation sequencing technologies has promoted the field of immunogenetics and produced numerous immunogenomics data. Modern data-driven research has the power to promote novel biomedical discoveries through secondary analysis of such data. Therefore, it is important to ensure data-driven research with great reproducibility and robustness for promoting a precise and accurate secondary analysis of the immunogenomics data. In scientific research, rigorous conduct in designing and conducting experiments is needed, specifically in scientific and articulate writing, reporting and interpreting results. It is also crucial to make raw data available, discoverable, and well described or annotated in order to promote future re-analysis of the data. In order to assess the data availability of published T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire data, we examined 11,918 TCR-Seq samples corresponding to 134 TCR-Seq studies ranging from 2006 to 2022. Among the 134 studies, only 38.1% had publicly available raw TCR-Seq data shared in public repositories. We also found a statistically significant association between the presence of data availability statements and the increase in raw data availability (p=0.014). Yet, 46.8% of studies with data availability statements failed to share the raw TCR-Seq data. There is a pressing need for the biomedical community to increase awareness of the importance of promoting raw data availability in scientific research and take immediate action to improve its raw data availability enabling cost-effective secondary analysis of existing immunogenomics data by the larger scientific community.",
