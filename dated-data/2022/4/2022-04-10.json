    "abstract": "Kale are a group of diverse Brassicaceae species that are nutritious leafy greens consumed for their abundance of vitamins and micronutrients. Typified by their curly, serrated and/or wavy leaves, kale varieties have been primarily defined based on their leaf morphology and geographic origin, despite having complex genetic backgrounds. Kale is a very promising crop for vertical farming due to its high nutritional content; however, being a non-model organism, foundational, systems-level analyses of kale are lacking. Previous studies in kale have shown that time-of-day harvesting can affect its nutritional composition. Therefore, to gain a systems-level diel understanding of kale across its wide-ranging and diverse genetic landscape, we selected nine publicly available and commercially grown kale cultivars for growth under near-sunlight LED light conditions ideal for vertical farming. We then analyzed changes in morphology, growth and nutrition using a combination of phenomics, proteomics and metabolomics. As the diel molecular activities of plants drive their daily growth and development, ultimately determining their productivity as a crop, we harvested kale leaf tissue at both end-of-day (ED) and end-of-night (EN) time-points for all molecular analyses. Our results reveal that diel proteome and metabolome signatures divide the selected kale cultivars into two distinct groups, defined by their amino acid and sugar content, along with significant proteome differences involving carbon and nitrogen metabolism, mRNA splicing, protein translation and light harvesting. Together, our multi-cultivar, multi-omic analysis provides robust quantitative insights into the molecular underpinnings of the diel growth and development landscape of kale, significantly advancing our fundamental understanding of this nutritious leafy green super-food for next-generation horticulture / vertical farming applications.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy, a conserved pathway which carries out the bulk degradation of cytoplasmic material in eukaryotic cells, is critical in plant physiology and development. It is tightly regulated by ATG13, a core component of ATG1 kinase complex which initiates autophagy. Although it has been reported that ATG13 is dephosphorylated immediately after nutrient starvation, the phosphatase regulating this process is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrated that the septuple mutant (topp-7m) and octuple mutant (topp-8m) of type one protein phosphatase (TOPP) exhibited significantly reduced tolerance to fixed-carbon (C) starvation due to compromised autophagy activity. Genetic analysis placed TOPP upstream of autophagy. Interestingly, ATG13a was found to be an interactor of TOPP. And TOPP directly dephosphorylated ATG13a in vitro and in vivo. Meanwhile, eighteen phosphorylation sites of ATG13a were identified by LC-MS. Mimic dephosphorylation of ATG13a at these 18 sites significantly promoted autophagy and increased the atg13ab mutant tolerance to fixed-C starvation. Further study showed that the dephosphorylation of ATG13a facilitated ATG1a-ATG13a complex formation. Consistently, the recruitment of ATG13a for ATG1a was markedly inhibited in topp-7m-1. In addition, TOPP-controlled dephosphorylation of ATG13a boosted ATG1a phosphorylation. Taken together, our study reveals the crucial role of TOPP in regulating autophagy by stimulating the formation of ATG1a-ATG13a complex through dephosphorylating ATG13a in Arabidopsis.",

    "abstract": "Discovery of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system revolutionized the field of plant genomics. Despite advantages in ease of designing gRNA and the low cost of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, there are still hurdles to overcome in low mutation efficiencies, specifically in hexaploid wheat. In conjunction with gene delivery and transformation frequency, the mutation rate bottleneck has the potential to slow down advancements in genomic editing of wheat. In this study, nine bombardment parameter combinations using three gold particle sizes and three rupture disk pressures were tested to establish optimal stable transformation frequencies in wheat. Utilizing the best transformation protocol and a knockout cassette of the phytoene desaturase gene, we subjected transformed embryos to four temperature treatments and compared mutation efficiencies. The use of 0.6 m gold particles for bombardment increased transformation frequencies across all delivery pressures. A heat treatment of 34{degrees}C for 24 hours resulted in the highest mutation efficiency with no or minimal reduction in transformation frequency. The 34{degrees}C treatment produced two M0 mutant events with albino phenotypes, requiring biallelic mutations in all three genomes of hexaploid wheat. Utilizing optimal transformation and heat treatment parameters greatly increases mutation efficiency and can help advance research efforts in wheat genomics.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid rice has an advantage in its heterosis, resulting in high yield and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. However, genetic improvement of grain quality is more challenging in hybrid rice than in inbred rice due to additional complexity, such as the dominant effect. It is critical to identify a path to efficiently develop inbreds and identify their superior crosses for hybrid production. Here, we developed a pipeline for joint analysis of phenotypes, effects, and generations (JPEG) and analysed 113 inbred varieties as male parents, five tester varieties as female parents, and their 565 (113x5) hybrid testcrosses for 12 grain quality traits, including grain length and width, chalkiness, and amylose content. A total of 1,619,588 single nucleotide polymorphisms were obtained for the parent varieties and inferred for the hybrids using whole-genome sequencing with an average sequencing depth of 11x. Genome-wide association studies with JPEG identified 128 loci associated with at least one of the 12 traits. There were 44 and 97 loci with additive and dominant effects, respectively, including 13 overlaps. Among the 128 associated loci, 42 loci are located in or near (<200 kb) 17 known genes. Pyramiding genetic loci with additive and/or dominant effects in genomic selection dramatically improves the accuracy of predicting hybrid performances. More than 45% of genetic variation was explained by the identified markers for all traits except one (30%). These results demonstrate that pyramiding genetically identified additive and dominant loci can afford substantial power for predicting hybrid performances, presenting opportunities to identify superior crosses from existing phenotypes and genotypes of inbreds and hybrids.",

    "abstract": "Whether synthetic genomes can power life has attracted broad interest in the synthetic biology field, especially when the synthetic genomes are extensively modified with thousands of designer features. Here we report de novo synthesis of the largest eukaryotic chromosome thus far, synIV, a 1,454,621-bp Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome resulting from extensive genome streamlining and modification. During the construction of synIV, we developed megachunk assembly combined with a hierarchical integration strategy, which significantly increased the accuracy and flexibility of synthetic chromosome construction and facilitated chromosome debugging. In addition to the drastic sequence changes made to synIV by rewriting it, we further manipulated the three-dimensional structure of synIV in the yeast nucleus to explore spatial gene regulation within the nuclear space. Surprisingly, we found few gene expression changes, suggesting that positioning inside the yeast nucleoplasm plays a minor role in gene regulation. Lastly, we tethered synIV to the inner nuclear membrane via its hundreds of loxPsym sites and observed transcriptional repression of the entire chromosome, demonstrating chromosome-wide transcription manipulation without changing the DNA sequences. Our manipulation of the spatial structure of the largest synthetic yeast chromosome shed light on higher-order architectural design of the synthetic genomes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=199 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487066v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (64K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15c7095org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e37a30org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16af190org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1951c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIDe novo synthesis of the largest eukaryotic chromosome, synIV\nC_LIO_LISynIV shows similar 3D structure to wild-type IV, despite thousands of changes made to it\nC_LIO_LI\"Inside-out\" repositioning of synIV in nucleus shows minor transcriptional changes\nC_LIO_LIMultipoint tethering synIV to inner nuclear membrane represses transcription of whole chromosome\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal adult neurodegenerative disease characterized by proteostasis dysregulation, resulting in progressive loss of spinal and upper motor neurons. A subset of cranial motor neurons resistant to ALS-stress survive until late stages of the disease. To investigate these differences, we exploited a unique platform of induced cranial and spinal motor neurons (iCrMNs and iSpMNs, respectively). Exposing both cell types to proteotoxic stress, we quantified transcriptome and proteome changes over 36 hours for a core set of >8,200 genes. While mRNA and protein changes under stress were congruent for many genes, cell-type specific differences manifested at either the RNA or protein level, but less at both. At the protein level, iCrMNs and iSpMNs differed significantly with respect to abundance of many membrane proteins, including synaptic proteins, solute carriers, adhesion molecules, and signaling molecules suggesting that the superior stress survival of iCrMNs involve diverse pathways supporting neuronal function. Other differences included genes involved in ribosome biogenesis and subunits of the core proteasome. We investigated the role of proteasomal degradation in more detail. Our data showed that although stress reduces proteasome activity in both neuronal types, iCrMNs had significantly more abundant and active 26S proteasome than iSpMNs, which indicate a higher capacity for the degradation of ubiquitinated proteins. We identified a new regulator of this better performance, i.e. the nuclear proteasome activator Ublcp1, whose inhibition sensitized iCrMNs, but not iSpMNs, to stress and abolished their higher survival rates. The results suggest that the two neuronal cell types regulate and use the degradation machinery differently under normal and stress conditions. Overall, this work demonstrates the value of unbiased system-wide analyses in generating hypotheses on differential proteostasis regulation in cranial and spinal motor neurons.",

    "abstract": "One central issue in coffee-leaf rust (Hemileia vastatrix) epidemiology is to understand what determines the intensity and the timing of yearly infections in coffee plantations. However, most experimental and theoretical studies report infection as an average at the plot level, obscuring the role of potentially key factors like rust dispersal or the planting pattern. Here, we first review the rust epidemic patterns of different sites, which reveal large variability in the duration and magnitude of the different epidemiologic phases. We then present a spatially explicit and parametrised model, where the host population is subdivided into discrete patches linked through spore dispersal, modelled as simple diffusion. With this model, we study the role of the planting arrangement, the dispersal intensity and plant-level variables on the maximum average tree infection (MATI) and its timing. Our results suggest that the epidemic timeline can be divided into two phases: a time lag and a growth phase per se. The model shows that the combination of the dispersal magnitude and plant aggregation modifies the MATI and the time to MATI, mainly by preventing some plants from reaching their maximum peak during the epidemic. It also affects the epidemic curves, which can have a stepped, or a rather smooth pattern in plots with otherwise similar conditions. The initial rust infection modulates the time lag before the epidemic and the infected leaf-fall rate drastically changes the MATI. These findings highlight the importance of explicitly considering the spatial aspects of coffee agroecosystems when measuring and managing rust infection, and help us to further understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of ecological systems in general.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression in mammalian cells is highly variable and episodic, and results in a series of discontinuous bursts of mRNAs. A challenge is understanding how static promoter architecture and dynamic feedback regulations dictate bursting on a genome-wide scale. Although single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provides an opportunity to address this issue, effective analytical methods are scarce. We developed an interpretable and scalable inference framework, which combined experimental data with a mechanistic model to infer transcriptional burst kinetics (sizes and frequencies) and feedback regulations. Applying this framework to scRNA-seq data generated from embryonic mouse fibroblast cells, we found Simpsons paradoxes, i.e., genome-wide burst kinetics exhibited different characteristics in two cases without and with distinguishing feedback regulations. We show that feedbacks differently modulate burst frequencies and sizes and conceal the effects of transcription start site distributions on burst kinetics. Notably, only in the presence of positive feedback, TATA genes are expressed with high burst frequencies and enhancer-promoter interactions mainly modulate burst frequencies. The developed inference method provided a flexible and efficient way to investigate transcriptional burst kinetics and the obtained results would be helpful for understanding cell development and fate decision.",

    "abstract": "Human learning is an active and complex process. However, the brain mechanisms underlying human skill learning and the effect of learning on the communication between brain regions, at different frequency bands, are still largely unknown. Here, we tracked changes in large-scale electrophysiological networks over a 6-week training period during which participants practiced a series of motor sequences during 30 home training sessions. Our findings showed that brain networks become more flexible with learning in all the frequency bands from theta to gamma ranges. We found consistent increase of flexibility in the prefrontal and limbic areas in the theta and alpha band, and over somatomotor and visual areas in the alpha band. Specific to the beta rhythm, we revealed that higher flexibility of prefrontal regions during the early stage of learning strongly correlated with better performance measured during home training sessions. Our findings provide novel evidence that prolonged motor skill practice results in higher, frequency-specific, temporal variability in brain network structure.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWe investigated the large-scale organization of electrophysiological brain networks of a cohort of 30 participants practicing a series of motor sequences during 6 weeks of training. With learning, we observed a progressive modulation of the dynamics of prefrontal and limbic regions from theta to alpha frequencies, and of centro-parietal and occipital regions within visuomotor networks in the alpha band. In addition, higher prefrontal regional flexibility during early practice correlated with learning occurring during the 6 weeks of training. This provides novel evidence of a frequency-specific reorganization of brain networks with prolonged motor skill learning and an important neural basis for non-invasive research into the role of cortical functional interactions in (visuo)motor learning.",

    "abstract": "Visual perceptual decision-making involves multiple components including visual encoding, attention, accumulation of evidence, and motor execution. Recent research suggests that EEG oscillations can identify the time of encoding and the onset of evidence accumulation during perceptual decision-making. Although scientists show that spatial attention improves participant performance in decision making, little is know about how spatial attention influences the individual cognitive components that gives rise to that improvement in performance. We found evidence in this work that both visual encoding time (VET) before evidence accumulation and other non-decision time process after or during evidence accumulation are influenced by spatial top-down attention, but not evidence accumulation itself. Specifically we used an open-source data set in which participants were informed about the location of a target stimulus in the visual field on some trials during a face-car perceptual decision-making task. Fitting neural drift-diffusion models to response time, accuracy, and single-trial N200 latencies (~ 125 to 225 ms post-stimulus) of EEG allowed us to separate the processes of visual encoding and the decision process from other non-decision time processes such as motor execution. These models were fit in a single step in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Model selection criteria and comparison to model simulations show that spatial attention manipulates both VET and other non-decision time process. We discuss why spatial attention may affect other non-evidence accumulation processes, such as motor execution time (MET), and why this may seem unexpected given the literature. We make recommendations for future work on this topic.",

    "abstract": "Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) is characterized by absence seizures which are episodes of lack of consciousness accompanied by electrographic spike-wave discharges. About 60% of children and adolescents with ASs are affected by major neuropsychological comorbidities, including anxiety. Endocannabinoids and monoamines are likely involved in the pathophysiology of these CAE psychiatric comorbidities.\n\nHere, we show that the synthetic cannabinoid receptor type 1/2 (CB1/2R) agonist WIN 55,212-2 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) has a strain-dependent effect on anxiety-like and motor behavior and cerebral monoaminergic levels in Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg (GAERS) and their non-epileptic control (NEC) rat strain. Using quantitative and Temporal-Pattern analysis, we found that WIN 55,212-2 did not affect the emotional status of GAERS but it was anxiolytic in NEC. Conversely, WIN 55,212-2 had a sedative effect in GAERS but was ineffective in NEC. Moreover, vehicle-treated GAERS are more motivated to explore by implementing more complex and articulated strategies. These behavioral changes correlate with the reduction of 5-HT in the hippocampus and substantia nigra (SN) and noradrenaline (NA) in the entopeduncular nucleus (EPN) in vehicle-treated GAERS compared to NEC rats which could contribute to their low anxiety status and hypermotility, respectively. On the other hand, the increased level of NA in the EPN and 5-HT in the SN is consistent with an activation of the basal ganglia output-mediated motor suppression observed in WIN 55,212-2-treated GAERS rats.\n\nThese data support the view of a strain-dependent alteration of the endocannabinoid system by adding evidence of lower emotional responsiveness and a basal ganglia hypersensitivity to cannabinoids in GAERS compared to NEC rats.",

    "abstract": "The Fusiform Face Area (FFA) is a widely studied region causally involved in face perception. Even though cognitive neuroscientists have been studying the FFA for over two decades, answers to foundational questions regarding the structure, function, and connectivity of the FFA from a large (N>1000) group of participants are still lacking. To fill this gap, we quantified structural, functional, and connectivity features of fusiform face-selective regions in 1080 participants in the Human Connectome Project (HCP). After manually defining over 4,000 fusiform face-selective regions, we report five main findings. First, 68.94% of hemispheres have two cortically separate regions (pFus-faces/FFA-1 and mFus-faces/FFA-2). Second, in 26.48% of hemispheres, pFus-faces/FFA-1 and mFus-faces/FFA-2 are spatially contiguous, yet functionally and structurally distinct. Third, pFus-faces/FFA-1 is more face-selective than mFus-faces/FFA-2, and the two regions have distinct functional connectivity fingerprints. Fourth, pFus-faces/FFA-1 is cortically thinner and more heavily myelinated than mFus-faces/FFA-2. Fifth, face-selective patterns and functional connectivity fingerprints of each region were more similar in monozygotic than dizygotic twins and more so than structural gradients. As we share our areal definitions with the field, future studies can explore how structural and functional features of these regions will inform theories regarding how visual categories are represented in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Social dominance is an important feature of social life. Dominance has been proposed to be one of two trait dimensions underpinning social judgments of human faces. Yet, the neural bases of the ability to identify different dominance levels in others based on facial features remains poorly understood. Here, we used event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine the temporal dynamics of facial dominance evaluation based on facial features signaling physical strength/weakness in humans. Twenty-seven participants performed a dominance perception task where they passively viewed faces with different dominance levels. Dominance levels did not modulate an early component of face processing, known as the N170 component, but did modulate the Late Positive Potential (LPP) component. These findings indicate that participants inferred dominance levels at a late stage of face evaluation. Furthermore, the highest level of dominant faces and the lowest level of submissive faces both elicited higher LPP amplitudes than faces with a neutral dominance level. Taken together, the present study provides new insights regarding the dynamics of the neurocognitive processes underlying facial dominance evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by hypercholesterolemia. During aging, T-cells accumulate cholesterol, which could lead to a pro-inflammatory phenotype. However, the role of cholesterol efflux pathways mediated by ATP-binding cassette A1 and G1 (ABCA1/ABCG1) in T-cell-dependent age-related inflammation and atherosclerosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we generated mice with T-cell-specific Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency on the low-density-lipoprotein-receptor deficient (Ldlr-/-) background. T-cell Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency decreased blood, lymph node, and splenic T-cells, and increased T-cell activation and apoptosis. T-cell Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency induced a premature T-cell aging phenotype in middle-aged (12-13 months) Ldlr-/- mice, reflected by upregulation of senescence markers. Despite T-cell senescence and enhanced T-cell activation, T-cell Abca1/Abcg1-deficiency decreased atherosclerosis and aortic inflammation in middle-aged Ldlr-/- mice, accompanied by decreased T-cells in atherosclerotic plaques. We attribute these effects to T-cell apoptosis downstream of T-cell activation. Collectively, T-cell cholesterol efflux pathways are critical for maintaining T-cell numbers, suppress senescence, and induce atherosclerosis in middle-aged Ldlr-/- mice.",

    "abstract": "The antibiotic crisis increasingly threatens the health systems world-wide. Especially as there is an innovation gap in the development of novel antibiotics, treatment options for bacterial infections become fewer. The photodynamic inactivation (PDI) of bacteria appears to be a potent, new technology that may support the treatment of colonized or infected skin. In photodynamic inactivation, a dye - called photosensitizer - absorbs light and generates reactive singlet oxygen. This singlet oxygen is then capable of killing bacteria independent of species or strain and their antibiotic resistance profile. In order to provide a practical application for the skin surface, the photosensitizer was included in an aqueous hydrogel (photodynamically active hydrogel). The efficacy of this gel was initially tested on an inanimate surface and then on the human skin ex vivo. NBTC staining and TUNEL assays were carried out on skin biopsies to investigate potential harmful effects of the surface PDI to the underlying skin cells. The photosensitizer in the gel sufficiently produced singlet oxygen while showing only little photobleaching. On inanimate surfaces as well as on the human skin, the number of viable bacteria was reduced by over or nearly up to 4 log10 steps, equal to 99.99% reduction or even more. Furthermore, histological staining showed no harmful effects of the gel towards the tissue. The application of this hydrogel represents a valuable method in decolonizing human skin including the potential to act against superficial skin infections. The presented results are promising and should lead to further investigation in a clinical study to check the effectivity of the photodynamically active hydrogel on patients.",

    "abstract": "Bile acids are steroid detergents in bile that contribute to fat absorption, cell signaling and microbiome interactions in mammals. The final step in their synthesis is amino acid conjugation with either glycine or taurine to a cholic acid or chenodeoxycholic acid backbone in the liver by the enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT). Here, we describe the microbial, chemical, and physiological consequences of BAAT gene deletion in mice. BAAT-/- mice were underweight after weaning but quickly exhibited catch-up growth. At 3-weeks-of-age, KO animals had increased phospholipid excretion and decreased subcutaneous fat pad mass, glycogen staining in hepatocytes and vitamin A stores in the liver, but these phenotypes were less marked in adulthood. Their bile acid (BA) pool was highly altered throughout the 8-weeks of life but was not completely devoid of conjugated BAs. These animals had 27-fold lower amounts of taurine-conjugated BAs than wildtype in their liver, but similar concentrations of glycine-conjugated BAs and higher microbially-conjugated BAs. The BA pool in BAAT-/- was enriched in a variety of unusual bile acids that were putatively sourced from cysteamine conjugation with subsequent oxidation and methylation of the sulfur group to mimic taurine. KO mice also had an altered microbiome, but most strongly in the first 3-weeks, indicating bile acid conjugation is important for proper microbiome development during the postnatal period. Finally, antibiotic treatment increased taurine, glycine, and the unusually conjugated BAs in BAAT-/- animals, indicating the microbiome was not the likely source of the conjugation. Instead, BA conjugation in KO animals was likely derived from the peroxisomal acyltransferases ACNAT1 and ACNAT2, which are duplications of BAAT in the mouse genome, but inactivated in humans. This study demonstrates that BA conjugation is important for early life development in mice and is facilitated by other host or microbial enzymes besides BAAT in a manner that results in molecular mimics of taurine that may rescue pathological phenotypes.",

Emerging evidence supports a model where plasticity of differentiated cells, particularly those in the secretory lineages, contributes to epithelial regeneration upon ablation of injury-sensitive stem cells. However, such facultative stem cell activity is rare within secretory populations. Here we ask whether specific functional properties predict facultative stem cell activity. We utilize in vivo labeling combined with ex vivo organoid formation assays to evaluate how cell age and autophagic state contribute to facultative stem cell activity within secretory lineages. Strikingly, we find that cell age (time elapsed since cell cycle exit) does not correlate with secretory cell plasticity. Instead, high autophagic activity predicts plasticity and resistance to DNA damaging injury independently of cell lineage. Our findings indicate that autophagic status prior to injury serves as a lineageagnostic marker for the prospective identification of facultative stem cells.",

    "abstract": "The primary cilium is a conserved microtubule-based organelle that serves as a hub for many signaling pathways. It functions as part of the centrosome/cilium complex, which also contains the basal body and the centriolar satellites. Little is known about the mechanisms by which the microtubule-based axoneme of the cilium is assembled with proper length and structure, particularly in terms of the activity of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) and the crosstalk between the different compartments of the centrosome/cilium complex. Here, we analyzed CCDC66, a MAP implicated in cilium biogenesis and ciliopathies affecting eye and brain. Live-cell imaging revealed that CCDC66 compartmentalizes between centrosomes, centriolar satellites, and the ciliary axoneme and tip during cilium assembly and disassembly. CCDC66 loss-of-function in human cells causes defects in cilium assembly, length and morphology. Notably, CCDC66 interacts with the MAPs and ciliopathy proteins CEP104 and CSPP1 and cooperates with them during axonemal length regulation. Moreover, CCDC66 interacts with the transition zone protein CEP290 selectively at the centriolar satellites. Its loss disrupts basal body recruitment of transition zone proteins and IFT-B machinery and causes defective Hedgehog signaling. Overall, our results establish CCDC66 as a multifaceted regulator of the primary cilium, and propose a mechanistic insight into how the cooperation of ciliary MAPs as well as subcompartments ensures assembly of a functional cilium.",

Distinct cilia have cell-specific morphologies and exert distinct functions. However, the underlying mechanisms of cell-specific ciliogenesis and regulation are unclear. Here we identified a WD40-repeat (WDR) protein, WDR47/NMTN-1, and show that it is specifically required for ciliogenesis of AWB chemosensory neurons in C. elegans. WDR47/NMTN-1 is expressed in the AWB chemosensory neuron pair, and is localized at the basal body (BB) of the AWB cilia. Knockout of wdr47/nmtn-1 causes abnormal AWB neuron cilia morphology, structural integrity, and induces aberrant AWB-mediated aversive behaviors. We further demonstrate that wdr47/nmtn-1 deletion affects movement of intraflagellar transport (IFT) particles and their cargo delivery in AWB neurons. Our results indicate that WDR47/NMTN-1 is essential for AWB neuron ciliary morphology and function, which reveal a novel mechanism for cell-specific ciliogenesis. Since WDR47/NMTN-1 is conserved in mammals, our findings may help understand the process of cell-specific ciliogenesis and provide insights for treating ciliopathies.",

Here we show that apical progenitors are heterogeneous with respect to their apical surface area. In Efnb1 mutants, the size of the apical surface is modified and this correlates with discrete alterations of tissue organization without impacting proliferation or differentiation.

    "abstract": "Cyclones can cause mass mortality of seabirds, sometimes wrecking thousands of individuals. The few studies to track pelagic seabirds during cyclones show they tend to circumnavigate the strongest winds. We tracked adult shearwaters in the Sea of Japan over 11 years and find that the response to cyclones varied according to the wind speed and direction. In strong winds, birds that were sandwiched between the storm and mainland Japan flew away from land and towards the eye of the storm, flying within [&le;] 30 km of the eye and tracking it for up to 8 hours. This exposed shearwaters to some of the highest wind speeds near the eye wall ([&le;] 21 m s-1), but enabled them to avoid strong onshore winds in the storms wake. Extreme winds may therefore become a threat when an inability to compensate for drift could lead to forced landings and collisions. Birds may need to know where land is in order to avoid it. This provides additional selective pressure for a map sense and could explain why juvenile shearwaters, which lack a map sense, instead navigating using a compass heading, are susceptible to being wrecked. We suggest that the ability to respond to storms is influenced by both flight and navigational capacities. This may become increasingly pertinent due to changes in extreme weather patterns.\n\nSignificance StatementCyclones can cause billions of dollars of damage and loss of human life. They can also cause mass mortality and strandings in seabirds. We used GPS tracking data from streaked shearwaters breeding in the worlds most active cyclone basin to understand how seabirds respond to these systems. Birds varied their response according to the wind speed and direction, generally flying towards the eye of the cyclone in strong winds.

    "abstract": "Microbes affect plant health, stress tolerance1 and life history2. In different regions of the globe, plants are colonized by distinct pathogenic and commensal microbiomes, but the factors driving their geographic variation are largely unknown3. We identified and measured the core leaf microbiome of Arabidopsis thaliana in its native range, from almost 300 populations across Europe. Comparing the distribution of the approximately 500 major bacterial phylotypes, we discovered marked, geography-dependent differences in microbiome composition within A. thaliana and between A. thaliana and other Brassicaceae, with two distinct microbiome types segregating along a latitudinal gradient. The differences in microbiome composition mirror the spatial genetics of A. thaliana, with 52-68% of variance in the first two principal coordinates of microbiome type explained by host genotype. Microbiome composition is best predicted by drought-associated metrics that are well known to be a major selective agent on A. thaliana populations. The reproducible and predictable associations between specific microbes and water availability raise the possibility that drought not only directly shapes genetic variation in A. thaliana, but does so also indirectly through its effects on the leaf microbiome.",

    "abstract": "Dietary fiber affects the composition and functions of microbial communities that reside in the human gut. However, we lack a detailed and quantitative understanding of how these nutrients shape microbial community dynamics, interaction networks and systems-level properties. Using synthetic human gut communities coupled to computational modeling, we dissect the effects of varied fiber types or their constituent sugars on community assembly and sensitivity to perturbations. By quantifying carbohydrate chemical complexity, we demonstrate that microbial growth decreases as a function of complexity. We further demonstrate that the balance of species occupying distinct metabolic niches is altered by the presence of chemically complex carbohydrates. The frequency of negative inter-species interactions is reduced in the presence of complex carbohydrates. Communities grown in complex carbohydrates reproducibly assemble from a wide range of initial species abundances and display reduced sensitivity to invasion. Resource competition is identified as a key mechanism influencing the response of communities to perturbations. The strength of resource competition can promote sensitivity of community assembly to variations in initial species proportions and impact community resistance to invasion. By limiting microbial growth, complex carbohydrates promote the expansion of species occupying niches beyond carbohydrate utilization, shape the distribution of inter-species interactions, which in turn determines the communitys response to perturbations.",

    "abstract": "Photosynthetic eukaryotes, such as microalgae and plants, foster fundamentally important relationships with their microbiome based on the reciprocal exchange of chemical currencies. Among these, the dicarboxylate metabolite azelaic acid (Aze) appears to play an important, but heterogeneous, role in modulating these microbiomes, as it is used as a carbon source for some heterotrophs but is toxic to others. However, the ability of Aze to promote or inhibit growth, as well as its uptake and assimilation mechanisms into bacterial cells are mostly unknown. Here, we use transcriptomics, transcriptional factor coexpression networks, uptake experiments, and metabolomics to unravel the uptake, catabolism and toxicity of Aze on two microalgal-associated bacteria, Phycobacter and Alteromonas, whose growth is promoted or inhibited by Aze, respectively. We identify the first putative Aze transporter in bacteria, a  C4-TRAP transporter, and show that Aze is assimilated through fatty acid degradation, with further catabolism occurring through the glyoxylate and butanoate metabolism pathways when used as a carbon source. Phycobacter took up Aze at an initial uptake rate of 3.8x10-9 nmol cell-1 hr-1 and utilized it as a carbon source in concentrations ranging from 10 M-1 mM, suggesting a broad range of acclimation to Aze availability. For inhibited bacteria, we infer that Aze inhibits the ribosome and/or protein synthesis and that a suite of efflux pumps is utilized to shuttle Aze outside the cytoplasm. We demonstrate that seawater amended with Aze becomes enriched in bacterial families that can catabolise Aze, which appears to be a different mechanism from that in soil, where modulation by the host plant is required. This study enhances our understanding of carbon cycling in the oceans and how microscale chemical interactions can structure marine microbial populations. In addition, our findings unravel the role of a key chemical currency in the modulation of eukaryote-microbiome interactions across diverse ecosystems.",

Thus, there are two possible eco-evolutionary strategies: grow faster or disperse faster (R -- D arbitrage). Here we explore, through a reaction-diffusion model, how spatial heterogeneity can shape the R -- D trade-off by studying the spreading dynamics of a consumer species exploiting a resource in a spatially fragmented environment. Based on numerical simulations and analytical solutions derived from simpler models, we show that the classical mathematical symmetry between the effects of growth and dispersal on the spatial spreading speed is broken in the presence of competition between phenotypes. At the back of the forefront, the dynamics is almost always driven by the R specialists. On the forefront, R-strategies are favored in spatially homogeneous environments, but the introduction of heterogeneity leads to a shift towards D-strategies. This effect is even stronger when spatial heterogeneity affects the diffusion term and when spatial fragmentation is lower. Introducing mutations between phenotypes produces an advantage towards the R-strategy and homogenizes the distribution of phenotypes, also leading to more polymorphism on the forefront.",

    "abstract": "In insects, two types of telomere length maintenance are known: telomerase-dependent, resulting in chromosome ends consisting of short nucleotide repeats (typically TTAGG), and telomerase-independent, resulting in chromosome ends consisting of long nucleotide repeats or transposon-like elements. However, only a few species have been previously studied with regard to their telomere DNA sequences. Here, based on analysis of chromosome-level genome assemblies, I present the data on telomere and subtelomere organization for 180 species from 148 genera, 53 families and 8 orders of insects.\n\nAnalysis of these taxa reveals that in fact chromosome ends of most insect species have an intermediate structure and consist of numerous arrays of short telomeric repeats interspersed with telomere-specific non-LTR retrotransposons. An unexpectedly high level of diversity of short telomeric motifs (22 variants ranging in length from 1 to 17 nucleotides) is documented. Telomeres consisting of long repeats (from 173 to 374 bp) are confirmed for flies (the order Diptera) and also found in the orders Odonata and Hymenoptera. The most unusual telomere structure is found in the bee Lasioglossum lativentre, in which the chromosomes possess the short telomeric repeat TTAGGTCTGGG at only one end, whereas opposing ends terminate with medium and long repeats.\n\nI conclude that different types of telomere organization and numerous variants of long and short T-containing motifs, including the (T)n mononucleotide sequence, are compatible with the performance of telomere functions. I argue that both telomerase-dependent and telomerase-independent mechanisms for maintaining telomere length operate simultaneously in many insects. The balance between them and the exchange of sequences between telomeres and subtelomeres are most likely the key factors that determine the structure and evolution of telomeres.\n\nSignificanceMultilayer telomeres, resulted from numerous, site-specific insertions of retrotransposons into the region of short telomeric repeats, are not an aberrant type of organization, as previously thought. They are widely distributed among insects and can represent up to 30-40 % of eukaryotic species diversity. Accordingly, the telomere maintenance mechanism based on the joint work of telomerase-dependent and telomerase-independent mechanisms can also be extremely widespread in nature.",

    "abstract": "Rapid environmental change is affecting many organisms; some are coping well but many species are in decline. A key mechanism for facilitating success following environmental change is phenotypic plasticity. Organisms use cues to respond phenotypically to environmental conditions; many incorporate recent information (within-generation plasticity) and information from previous generations (transgenerational plasticity). We extend an existing evolutionary model where organisms utilize within-generational plasticity, transgenerational plasticity, rapid evolution, and bet-hedging. We show how, when rapid evolution of plasticity is not possible, the effect of environmental change (altering the environment mean, variance, or autocorrelation, or cue reliability) on population growth rate depends on selection for within-generation plasticity and transgenerational plasticity under historical environmental conditions. We then evaluate the predictions that populations adapted to highly variable environments, or with greater within-generational plasticity, are more likely to successfully respond to environmental change. We identify when these predictions fail, and show environmental change is most detrimental when previously reliable cues become unreliable. When multiple cues become unreliable, environmental change can cause deleterious effects regardless of the populations evolutionary history. Overall, this work provides a general framework for understanding the role of plasticity in population responses to rapid environmental change.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe unicellular ancestors of modern-day multicellular organisms were remarkably complex. They had an extensive set of regulatory and signalling genes, an intricate life cycle and could change their behaviour in response to environmental changes. At the transition to multicellularity, some of these behaviours were co-opted to organise the development of the nascent multicellular organism. Here, we focus on the transition to multicellularity before the evolution of stable cell differentiation, to reveal how the emergence of clusters affects the evolution of cell behaviour.\n\nResultsWe construct a computational model of a population of cells that can evolve the regulation of their behavioural state - either division or migration - in a unicellular or multicellular context. They compete for reproduction and for resources to survive in a seasonally changing environment. We find that the evolution of multicellularity strongly determines the co-evolution of cell behaviour, by altering the competition dynamics between cells. When adhesion cannot evolve, cells compete for survival by rapidly migrating towards resources before dividing. When adhesion evolves, emergent collective migration alleviates the pressure on individual cells to reach resources. This allows cells to selfishly maximise replication. Migrating adhesive clusters display striking patterns of spatio-temporal cell state changes that visually resemble animal development.\n\nConclusionsOur model demonstrates how emergent selection pressures at the onset of multicellularity can drive the evolution of cellular behaviour to give rise to developmental patterns.",

    "abstract": "Exome sequencing of thousands of families has revealed many individual risk genes for congenital heart defects (CHD), yet most cases cannot be explained by a single causal mutation. Further, those who carry de novo and inherited mutations in known risk genes often demonstrate variable phenotypes even within the same family, indicating the presence of genetic modifiers. To explore oligogenic causes of CHD without assessing billions of variant combinations, we developed an efficient, simulation-based method to detect gene sets that carry damaging variants in probands at a higher rate than expected given parental genotypes. We implemented this approach in software called Gene Combinations in Oligogenic Disease (GCOD) and applied it to a cohort of 3382 trios with exome sequencing. This analysis detected 353 high-confidence risk genes in 202 pairs that appear together in multiple probands but rarely or never appear in combination in their unaffected parents. Stratifying analyses by specific CHD diagnosis and considering gene combinations of higher orders yielded an additional 244 gene sets. The oligogenic genes we discovered cluster in pathways specific to heart development and suggest new molecular disease mechanisms, such as arylsulfatase activity and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. Finally, by combining CHD families with an autism spectrum disorder cohort, we were able to detect 925 oligogenic sets transmitted in renal disease, a known co-morbidity of both conditions. As genome sequencing is applied to more families and other disorders, GCOD will enable detection of increasingly large, novel gene combinations, shedding light on combinatorial causes of genetic diseases.",

Monitoring the dynamics of secretion from individually isolated cells is crucial because, in bulk analysis, secretion activity can be perturbed by cell-cell interactions, and a cell population rarely performs secretion in a magnitude- or duration-synchronized manner. Although various microfluidic techniques have been adopted to evaluate the abundance of single-cell-derived EVs, none can track their secretion dynamics continually for extended periods. Here, we have developed a droplet array-based method that allowed us to optically quantify the EV secretion dynamics of >300 single cells every 2 hours for 36 hours, which covers the cell doubling time of many cell types. The experimental results clearly show the highly heterogeneous nature of single-cell EV secretion and suggest that cell division facilitates EV secretion, showing the usefulness of this platform for discovering EV regulation machinery.",

    "abstract": "Crucial to variety improvement programs is the reliable and accurate prediction of genotypes performance across environments. However, due to the impactful presence of genotype by environment (GxE) interaction that dictates how changes in expression and function of genes influence target traits, prediction performance of genomic selection (GS) using single-environment models often falls short. Furthermore, despite the successes of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), the genetic insights derived from genome-to-phenome mapping have not yet been incorporated in predictive analytics, making GS models that use Gaussian kernel primarily an estimator of genomic similarity, instead of the underlying genetics characteristics of the populations. Here, we developed a GS framework that, in addition to capturing the overall genomic relationship, can capitalize on the signal of genetic associations of the phenotypic variation as well as the genetic characteristics of the populations. The capacity of predicting the performance of populations across environments was demonstrated by an overall gain in predictability up to 31% for the winter wheat DH population. Compared to Gaussian kernels, we showed that our multienvironment weighted kernels could better leverage the significance of genetic associations and yielded a marked improvement of 4-33% in prediction accuracy for half-sib families. Furthermore, the flexibility incorporated in our Bayesian implementation provides the generalizable capacity required for predicting multiple highly genetic heterogeneous populations across environments, allowing reliable GS for genetic improvement programs that have no access to genetically uniform material.",

    "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) from Uganda (UG) expresses a phenotype related to fetal loss whereas the variant from Brazil (BR) induces microcephaly in neonates. The differential virulence has a direct relation to biomolecular mechanisms that make one strain more aggressive than the other. The non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is a key viral toxin to comprehend these viral discrepancies because of its versatility in many processes of the virus life cycle. Here, we aim to examine through coarse-grained models and molecular dynamics simulations the protein-membrane interactions for both NS1ZIKV-UG and NS1ZIKV-BR dimers. A first evaluation allowed us to establish that the NS1 proteins, in the membrane presence, explore new conformational spaces when compared to systems simulated without a lipid bilayer. These events derive from both differential coupling patterns and discrepant binding affinities to the membrane. The N-terminal domain, intertwined loop, and greasy finger proposed previously as binding membrane regions were also computationally confirmed by us. The anchoring sites have aromatic and ionizable residues that manage the assembly of NS1 toward the membrane, especially for the Ugandan variant. Furthermore, the protein-membrane interaction induces perturbation in the distal part related to putative epitopes. These results open up new strategies for the treatment of flaviviruses.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=75 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487413v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11023e9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a5d417org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1073b91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7cffe_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Infrared spectroscopy has drawn considerable interests in biological applications, but the measurement of live cells is impeded by the attenuation of infrared light in water. Metasurfaceenhanced infrared reflection spectroscopy (MEIRS) had been shown to mitigate the problem, enhance the cellular infrared signal through surface-enhanced infrared absorption, and encode the cellular vibrational signatures in the reflectance spectrum at the same time. In this study, we used MEIRS to study the dynamic response of live cancer cells to a newly developed chemotherapeutic metal complex with distinct modes of action (MoAs): tricarbonyl rhenium isonitrile polypyridyl (TRIP). MEIRS measurements demonstrated that administering TRIP resulted in long-term (several hours) reduction in protein, lipid, and overall refractive index signals, and in short-term (tens of minutes) increase in these signals that was consistent with the induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress. The unique tricarbonyl IR signature of TRIP in the bio-orthogonal spectral window was monitored in real time, and was used as an infrared tag to detect the precise drug delivery time that was shown to be closely correlated with the onset of the phenotypic response. These results demonstrate that MEIRS is an effective label-free real-time cellular assay capable of detecting and interpreting the early phenotypic responses of cells to IR-tagged chemotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "We saccade three to five times per second when reading. However, little is known about the neuronal mechanisms coordinating the oculomotor and visual system during such rapid processing. Here we ask if brain oscillations play a role in the temporal coordination of the visuomotor integration. We simultaneously acquired MEG and eye-tracking data while participants read sentences silently. Every sentence was embedded with target words of either high or low lexical frequency. Our key finding demonstrated that saccade onsets were locked to the phase of alpha oscillations (8 - 13 Hz); in particular, for saccades towards low-frequency words. Source modelling demonstrated that the alpha oscillations to which the saccades were locked, were generated in the right-associative visual cortex (BA 19). Our findings suggest that the alpha oscillations serve to time the processing between the oculomotor and visual systems during natural reading, and that this coordination becomes more pronounced for demanding words.\n\nSignificance StatementReading is an essential skill in modern society that allows us to acquire information from written language. While we effortlessly can acquire the meaning of a text, the task of reading requires precisely timed saccades as our eyes jump from word to word. By using a natural reading task, we demonstrate that the coordination between saccades and visual processing is clocked by ongoing ~10 Hz alpha oscillations in the visual cortex. The clocking of the saccades by brain oscillations became particularly pronounced when the participants made saccades to demanding words.",

    "abstract": "Poleroviruses, enamoviruses, and lutoeviruses are icosahedral, positive sense RNA viruses that cause economically important diseases in food and fiber crops. They are transmitted by phloem-feeding aphids in a circulative manner that involves the movement across and within insect tissues. The N-terminal portion of the viral readthrough domain (NRTD) has been implicated as a key determinant of aphid transmission in each of these genera. Here, we report crystal structures of the NRTDs from the poleroviruses turnip yellow virus (TuYV) and potato leafroll virus (PLRV) at 1.53-[A] and 2.22-[A] resolution, respectively. These adopt a two-domain arrangement with a unique interdigitated topology and form highly conserved dimers that are stabilized by a C-terminal peptide that is critical for proper folding. We demonstrate that the PLRV NRTD can act as an inhibitor of virus transmission and identify NRTD mutant variants that are lethal to aphids. Sequence conservation argues that enamovirus and luteovirus NRTDs will follow the same structural blueprint, which affords a novel approach to block the spread of these agricultural pathogens in a generalizable manner.",

Surprisingly, we found that the whisker-evoked activity of regular versus fast spiking neurons changed in opposite directions after learning in primary and secondary whisker motor cortices, while it changed similarly in primary and secondary orofacial motor cortices. Our results suggest that changes in the balance of excitation and inhibition in local circuits concurrent with changes in the long-range synaptic inputs in distinct cortical regions might contribute to performance of delayed sensory-to-motor transformation.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies, both clinical and experimental, indicate that many neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers disease (AD) often display coexisting metabolic dysfunctions, which may exacerbate neurological symptoms. The hypothalamus is a brain region highly involved in maintaining metabolic and other homeostatic processes and is known to be involved in the etiology of AD, although the role of hypothalamic dysfunction in the onset, progression, and severity of AD is poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that our new model of genetic diversity in AD, the AD-BXDs, exhibits non-cognitive symptoms consistent with hypothalamic dysfunction and examined hypothalamic bulk RNA sequencing data in the AD-BXD panel to investigate how the AD transgene impacts gene expression profiles in the hypothalamus. Mostly notably, we identified strong neuroinflammatory signatures from the hypothalamus in the AD-BXDs as early as six months of age. A functionally unknown WGCNA module showed correlation to female body weight and contextual fear acquisition. Eigengene expression of microglial/macrophagic modules and their hub gene expressions were correlated to cognitive phenotypes. From these analyses, we nominated Plek and Laptm5 as new targets to attenuate neuroinflammation in AD.",

    "abstract": "Recognizing that diverse morphologies of neurons are reminiscent of structures of branched polymers, we put forward a principled and systematic way of classifying neurons that employs the ideas of polymer physics. In particular, we use 3D coordinates of individual neurons, which are accessible in recent neuron reconstruction datasets from electron microscope images. We numerically calculate the form factor, F (q), a Fourier transform of the distance distribution of particles comprising an object of interest, which is routinely measured in scattering experiments to quantitatively characterize the structure of materials. For a polymer-like object consisting of n monomers spanning over a length scale of r, F (q) scales with the wavenumber q(= 2{pi}/r) as F (q) [~] q-[D] at an intermediate range of q, where [D] is the fractal dimension or the inverse scaling exponent ([D] ={nu} -1) characterizing the geometrical feature (r [~] n{nu}) of the object. F (q) can be used to describe a neuron morphology in terms of its size (Rn) and the extent of branching quantified by [D]. By defining the distance between F (q)s as a measure of similarity between two neuronal morphologies, we tackle the neuron classification problem. In comparison with other existing classification methods for neuronal morphologies, our F (q)-based classification rests solely on 3D coordinates of neurons with no prior knowledge of morphological features. When applied to publicly available neuron datasets from three different organisms, our method not only complements other methods but also offers a physical picture of how the dendritic and axonal branches of an individual neuron fill the space of dense neural networks inside the brain.",

    "abstract": "The retina encodes environmental light intensity to drive innate physiological responses. The synaptic basis of such coding remains obscure. Intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are the only retinal output neurons stably encoding intensity. They do so even without their melanopsin photopigment, so specializations in their synaptic drive from bipolar cells (BCs) must also contribute. Here, we shed new light on mechanisms responsible for this unique intensity-coding drive. By ultrastructural reconstruction, we show that specific BC types and unusual ribbon synapses carry photoreceptor signals to ipRGCs. By glutamate imaging and electrophysiology, we show that their light responses are unusually persistent. Still, we find that virtually all BCs encode intensity. Intensity coding becomes restricted to ipRGCs primarily because other RGCs filter out steady-state intensity signals postsynaptically. Thus, neural \"pinholes\" in global, persistent neural \"masking\" allow intensity signals to be encoded by ipRGCs and sent to specific centers of the visual brain.",

There have been many efforts to build mathematical and computational embodiments in the form of discrete cell-group activities - termed neural masses - to understand particular the origins of evoked potentials, intrinsic patterns of activities such as theta, regulation of sleep, Parkinsons disease related dynamics, and instabilities such as seizure dynamics. As originally utilized, standard neural masses convert input through a sigmoidal function to a firing rate, and firing rate through a synaptic alpha function to other masses. Here we define a process to build almost from first principles (i.e. Hodgkin Huxley type models) mean field models of different neuron types that duplicate the stability, firing rate, and associated bifurcations as function of relevant slow variables - such as extracellular potassium - and synaptic current; and whose output is both firing rate and impact on the slow variables - such as transmembrane potassium flux. Small networks composed of just excitatory and inhibitory masses demonstrate expected dynamical states including stable firing, runaway excitation and depolarization block, and these transitions change in biologically observed ways with changes in extracellular potassium and excitatory-inhibitory balance.",

Much less is known about the signalling components that act downstream of mTORC1 that regulate cellular morphology, a vital determinant of cellular function. Here we show that the RNA-binding protein Unkempt, a key regulator of cellular morphogenesis, is a novel substrate mTORC1. We find that Unkempt phosphorylation is regulated by nutrient levels and growth factors via mTORC1. Furthermore, Unkempt physically interacts with and is directly phosphorylated by mTORC1 through binding to the regulatory-associated protein of mTOR, Raptor. Phosphorylation of Unkempt, which we find is mTORC1-dependent in cultured mammalian cell lines as well as in primary tissues, occurs largely within the highly serine-rich intrinsically disordered region of Unkempt. Importantly, mutation analysis of this region indicates that phosphorylation inhibits the ability of Unkempt to induce a bipolar morphology. Our findings reveal a novel molecular link between mTORC1 signalling and cellular morphogenesis.",

We identified cortical areas and neural activity patterns that mediate this flexibility during virtual-navigation, where mice switched navigation toward or away from a visual cue depending on its match to a remembered cue. An optogenetics screen identified V1, posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) as necessary for accurate decisions. Calcium imaging revealed neurons that can mediate rapid sensorimotor switching by encoding a conjunction of a current and remembered visual cue that predicted the mouses navigational choice from trial-to-trial. Their activity formed efficient population codes before correct, but not incorrect, choices. These neurons were distributed across posterior cortex, even V1, but were densest in RSC and sparsest in PPC. We propose the flexibility of navigation decisions arises from neurons that mix visual and memory information within a visual-parietal-retrosplenial network, centered in RSC.",

    "abstract": "Human cognition arises from information exchange within and between functionally connected brain networks. Alterations in such signal propagation across networks are linked to numerous disorders. Brain-wide signal propagation can be experimentally studied with simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), where TMS pulses introduce a signal at a certain network node and fMRI charts its propagation through the network. Yet, this approach ignores the fact that the (network) impact of a TMS pulse depends on brain state, where brain state fluctuates spontaneously from moment to moment (e.g. oscillatory state) as well as depending on what a participant does (neurocognitive state). Here, we assessed TMS-evoked fMRI activations as a function of neurocognitive state (eyes open versus eyes closed in complete darkness) and oscillatory state (low versus high pre-TMS alpha power, as measured with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG)). We applied supra-versus sub-threshold triple-pulse TMS to the right posterior parietal cortex in eight participants, while simultaneously recording EEG and fMRI during two different ocular states. In this first application of the multimodal TMS-EEG-fMRI paradigm to a cognitive network hub, we did not find evidence for a brain state modulation of TMS-induced signal propagation. Instead, we found state-independent TMS-evoked fMRI responses mostly in sensory areas such as the insula, superior temporal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus, but also in the frontal eye fields. Interestingly, neurocognitive state did seem to modulate the fMRI response to indirect TMS effects such as sensory stimulation. These results lead to several important insights for future cognitive multimodal TMS experiments.",

    "abstract": "The causal mechanisms which underlie rapid, transient, and dynamic coordination of large-scale functional brain networks remain unknown. Neuronal oscillations have been hypothesized to play a critical role influencing long-range communication between brain areas, with oscillatory phase differences influencing the effective connectivity between areas (Fries, 2005). However, it remains unclear how networks of spiking neurons could causally and mechanistically control the relative phase difference between cortical regions. Here we describe a simple model of spiking neurons that can dynamically control the relative phase differences between multiple brain areas. The model applies to any inhibition-based rhythm, and has four essential elements: a) tonic excitation of local recurrent networks of excitatory and inhibitory cells produces oscillations (Borgers et al., 2012); b) winner-take-all (WTA) dynamics permit only a small fraction of cells to fire on any given cycle (de Almeida et al., 2009); c) di-synaptic feed-forward inhibition leads to oscillatory phase resetting in a target area (Traub et al., 1996); and d) the range of conduction delays for inter-regional axonal projections span the duration of one oscillatory cycle (Swadlow, 1998). The key assumption of our model is to link WTA dynamics to conduction delays, such that only axons with a narrow range of delays are active at one time and are selected via local activity. Phase resetting in the target area converts this conduction delay into a specific phase difference. Thus, the model converts local differences in cellular excitation into inter-areal phase differences via WTA dynamics and feed-forward inhibition, where excitatory cells act as phase difference effectors or detectors. Including several WTA modules within a given area allows it to serve as a coordinating hub, controlling the relative phase differences of multiple distributed brain regions. Finally, we show how this model can help explains recent empirical results showing that individual neurons are sensitive to the relative phase difference between areas (Canolty et al., 2010).",

    "abstract": "Background potassium (K+) currents, conducted by two-pore domain K+ (K2P) channels, are critical for the stabilization of the membrane potential. The effect of K2P channels on motor rhythm remains enigmatic. We show here that the K2P TWK-40 regulates the rhythmic defecation motor program (DMP) in Caenorhabditis elegans. Disrupting TWK-40 suppresses the expulsion defects of nlp-40 and aex-2 mutants. By contrast, a gain-of-function (gf) mutant of twk-40 significantly reduces the expulsion frequency per DMP cycle. In situ whole-cell patch clamping demonstrates that TWK-40 forms an outward current that hyperpolarize the resting membrane potential of DVB neuron. In addition, TWK-40 substantially contributes to the rhythmic activity of DVB. Specifically, DVB Ca2+ oscillations exhibit obvious defects in twk-40 mutants. Expression of TWK-40(gf) in DVB recapitulates the expulsion deficiency of the twk-40(gf) mutant, and inhibits DVB Ca2+ oscillations in both wild-type and twk-40(lf) animals. Moreover, DVB innervated enteric muscles also exhibit rhythmic Ca2+ defects. Taken together, these results demonstrate that TWK-40 is an essential inhibitor of DMP, thus revealing a cellular mechanism linking K2P channels with rhythmic motor activity.",

    "abstract": "Lichens have a vital role in forest ecosystems and they are a threatened group in boreal forests. However, the conservation ecology of the total lichen community has very rarely been studied. Here we studied lichen species and communities, including macrolichens (= foliose and fruticose growth forms) and rarely studied crustose lichens, on decaying wood in boreal spruce-dominated forests in Finland. We also studied obligate lignicoles that grow only on dead wood and are mostly crustose in growth form. Species richness and community composition were examined on decaying logs and natural or cut stumps of Picea abies at different decay stages (2-5) in 14 stands, half of which were natural or seminatural and half recently managed. We used thorough search to yield a species list as close to complete as possible. Our study questions were: 1) Are species richness and lichen communities different in natural and managed forests, and if so, are there differences between macrolichens, crustose lichens and obligate lignicoles in how they respond to forest management? 2) How does the decay stage and dead wood type affect the lichens, i.e. are there differences between stumps and logs? We found a total of 127 lichen species. Most (75%) of the recorded lichen species were crustose. With a generalized linear model we found that crustose lichens and obligate lignicoles had a higher species richness in natural than managed forests, but macrolichen richness was not significantly affected by forest management. Utilizing non-metric multidimensional scaling we discovered that site level community composition of macrolichens, crustose lichens and obligate lignicoles was also significantly different between natural and managed forests. We found that on dead wood unit level the decay stage had a significant effect on species richness and community composition, so that the species richness of all studied groups declined during the decay process. The dead wood type (stump vs. log) had a significant effect on species richness of macrolichens and obligate lignicoles, as well as on the communities of crustose lichens.",

    "abstract": "A central debate in ecology has been the long running discussion on the role of apex predators in affecting the abundance and dynamics of their prey. In terrestrial systems, research has primarily relied on correlational approaches, due to the challenge of implementing robust experiments with replication and appropriate controls. A consequence of this is that we largely suffer from a lack of mechanistic understanding of the population dynamics of interacting species that can be surprisingly complex.\n\nMechanistic models offer an opportunity to examine the causes and consequences of some of this complexity. We present a bioenergetic mechanistic model of a tri-trophic system where the primary vegetation resource follows a seasonal growth function, and the herbivore and carnivore species are modelled using two integral projection models (IPMs) with body mass as the phenotypic trait. Within each IPM, the demographic functions are structured according to bioenergetic principles, describing how animals acquire and transform resources into body mass, energy reserves and breeding potential. We parameterise this model to reproduce the population dynamics of grass, elk and wolves in northern Yellowstone (USA), and investigate the impact of wolf reintroduction on the system.\n\nOur model generated predictions that closely matched the observed population sizes of elk and wolf in Yellowstone prior to and post wolf reintroduction. The introduction of wolves into our basal grass-elk bioenergetic model resulted in a population of 99 wolves, and a reduction in elk numbers by 61% (from 14,948 to 5,823) at equilibrium. In turn, vegetation biomass increased by approximately 25% in the growing season and more than 3-fold in the non-growing season. The addition of wolves to the model caused the elk population to shift from being food-limited to being predator-limited, and had a stabilising effect on elk numbers across different years. Wolf predation also led to a shift in the phenotypic composition of the elk population, via a small increase in elk average body mass.\n\nOur model represents a novel approach to the study of predator-prey interactions. Explicitly considering and linking bioenergetics, population demography and body mass phenotypes can provide novel insights into the mechanisms behind complex ecosystem processes.",

Global change can alter community assembly at both local and regional levels, potentially shifting communities into disequilibrium with their local environmental conditions. In this study, we evaluated the spatial variation in environmental filtering and habitat matching of 1078 riverine macroinvertebrate communities distributed across nine ecoregions within the conterminous United States.\n\nLocationConterminous United States.\n\nTaxonFreshwater macroinvertebrates.\n\nMethodsWe first quantified spatial patterns in environmental filtering, habitat matching, and functional trait diversity. We then used boosted regression trees to identify (1) functional trait predictors of environmental filtering and habitat matching and (2) environmental, landscape, and network variables that predict functional trait abundances.\n\nResultsOur results demonstrated that environmental filtering but not habitat matching varied strongly by ecoregion. We also found that functional trait diversity varied by ecoregion, but not as strongly as the signatures of environmental filtering. We did not identify consistent functional trait predictors for both environmental filtering and habitat matching, with trait predictors instead varying by individual traits, trait categories, and ecoregions. Notwithstanding inconsistent trait predictors, environmental filtering was primarily influenced by habitat preference traits while habitat matching was primarily influenced by both habitat preference and dispersal traits. Predictors of functional traits also varied by trait category and ecoregion, with habitat preference and dispersal traits primarily influenced by network variables.\n\nMain conclusionsOur study demonstrates the contingent patterns and drivers of environmental filtering and habitat matching on a macroecological scale. We aim for this work to provide the foundation on which trait-environment relationships can be further quantified and causal explanations established in the context of community disequilibrium and applied to conservation and management of freshwater systems.",

    "abstract": "Post-transcriptional regulation in multicellular organisms is mediated by microRNAs. However, the mechanisms that determine if a gene is regulated by miRNAs are poorly understood. Previous works focused mostly on miRNA seed matches and other features of the 3-UTR of transcripts. These common approaches relied on knowledge of the miRNA families, and computational approaches still yield poor, inconsistent results, with many false positives. In this work, we present a different paradigm for predicting miRNA-regulated genes based on proteins. In a novel, automated machine learning framework, we use sequence as well as diverse functional annotations to train models on multiple organisms using experimentally validated data. We present insights from tens of millions of features extracted and ranked from different modalities. We show high predictive performance per organism and in generalization across species. We provide a list of novel predictions for Danio rerio (zebrafish) and Arabidopsis thaliana (mouse-ear cress). We compare genomic models, and observe that our protein model outperforms genomics, while a unified model improves on both. While most membranous and disease related proteins are regulated by miRNAs, we observe the G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) family is an exception, being mostly unregulated by miRNAs, and we raise possible explanations for this. We further show that the evolutionary conservation among duplicated genes does not imply a coherence in miRNA regulation. We conclude that duplicated genes diverge in their tendency to be miRNA regulated. However, protein function is informative across species in predicting post-transcriptional miRNA regulation in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Peptide-RNA coacervates can result in the concentration and compartmentalization of simple biopolymers. Given their primordial relevance, peptide-RNA coacervates may have also been a key site of early protein evolution. However, the extent to which such coacervates might promote or suppress the exploration of novel peptide conformations is fundamentally unknown. To this end, we used electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to characterize the structure and dynamics of an ancient and ubiquitous nucleic acid binding element, the helix-hairpin-helix (HhH) motif, alone and in the presence of RNA, with which it forms coacervates. Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy applied to singly labeled peptides containing one HhH motif reveals the presence of dimers, even in the absence of RNA, and transient -helical character. Moreover, dimer formation is promoted upon RNA binding and was detectable within peptide-RNA coacervates. The distance distributions between spin labels are consistent with the symmetric (HhH)2-Fold, which is generated upon duplication and fusion of a single HhH motif and traditionally associated with dsDNA binding. These results support the hypothesis that coacervates are a unique testing ground for peptide oligomerization and that phase-separating peptides could have been a resource for the construction of complex protein structures via common evolutionary processes, such as duplication and fusion.",

    "abstract": "In humans, associative memories are more susceptible to age-related cognitive decline (ARCD) than are recognition memories. Reduced cAMP/cGMP signaling in the hippocampus may contribute to ARCD. Here, we found that both aging and traumatic brain injury-associated dementia increased expression of the cAMP/cGMP-degrading enzyme phosphodiesterase 11A (PDE11A) in the human hippocampus. Further, age-related increases in hippocampal PDE11A4 mRNA and protein were conserved in mice, as was the increased vulnerability of associative versus recognition memories to ARCD. Interestingly, mouse PDE11A4 protein in the aged ventral hippocampus (VHIPP) ectopically accumulated in the membrane fraction and filamentous structures we term \"ghost axons\". These age-related increases in expression were driven by reduced exoribonuclease-mediated degradation of PDE11A mRNA and increased PDE11A4-pS117/pS124, the latter of which also drove the punctate accumulation of PDE11A4. In contrast, PDE11A4-pS162 caused dispersal. Importantly, preventing age-related increases in PDE11 expression via genetic deletion protected mice from ARCD of short-term and remote long-term associative memory (aLTM) in the social transmission of food preference assay, albeit at the expense of recent aLTM. Further, mimicking age-related overexpression of PDE11A4 in CA1 of old KO mice caused aging-like impairments in CREB function and remote social--but not non-social--LTMs. RNA sequencing and phosphoproteomic analyses of VHIPP identified cGMP-PKG--as opposed to cAMP-PKA--as well as circadian entrainment, glutamatergic/cholinergic synapses, calcium signaling, oxytocin, and retrograde endocannabinoid signaling as mechanisms by which PDE11A deletion protects against ARCD. Together, these data suggest that PDE11A4 proteinopathies acutely impair signaling in the aged brain and contribute to ARCD of social memories.",

As proof-of-principle, we perform an RNAi screen of 702 human kinases and identify potential candidate upstream splicing regulators of the FGFR2 gene.

    "abstract": "Globally, ecosystems are being affected by multiple simultaneous stressors (also termed drivers, factors, or perturbations). While the effects of single stressors are becoming increasingly well understood, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding how multiple stressors may interact to affect ecosystems. Accordingly, there is substantial interest in documenting how stressors combine to impact individuals through to entire communities. Indeed, understanding how stressors interact represents one of the grand challenges currently facing ecologists and conservationists.\n\nPopular methods used to classify stressor interactions comprise multiple steps, including complex mathematical equations. Accordingly, there is the potential for errors to occur at multiple points, any of which can result in erroneous conclusions being drawn. Furthermore, there are frequently minor methodological differences between studies which may limit, or even prevent, direct comparisons of their results from being made.\n\nHere, we introduce the multiplestressR R package, a statistical tool which addresses the above issues. The package allows researchers to easily conduct a rigorous analysis of their multiple stressor data and provides results which are simple to interpret. The multiplestressR package can implement either the additive or multiplicative null model using iterations of these tools which are commonplace within multiple stressor ecology. The multiplestressR package can classify interactions as being synergistic, antagonistic, reversal, or null and requires minimal experience in either R or statistics to implement. Additionally, we provide example R code which can be easily modified to analysis any given factorial multiple stressor dataset. Indeed, widespread use of this software will allow for an easier and more robust comparison of results. Ultimately, we hope that the multiplestressR package will provide a stronger understanding of how stressors combine to affect individuals, populations, communities, and ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "The ecological theory of adaptive radiation has profoundly shaped our conceptualization of the rules that govern diversification. However, while many radiations follow classic early burst patterns of diversification as they fill ecological space, the longer-term fates of these radiations depend on many factors, such as climatic stability. In systems with periodic disturbances, species-rich clades can contain nested adaptive radiations of subclades with their own distinct diversification histories, and how adaptive radiation theory applies in these cases is less clear. Here, we investigated patterns of ecological and phenotypic diversification within two iterative adaptive radiations of cryonotothenioid fishes in Antarcticas Southern Ocean: crocodile icefishes and notoperches. For both clades, we observe evidence of repeated diversification into disparate regions of trait space between closely related taxa and into overlapping regions of trait space between distantly related taxa. We additionally find little evidence that patterns of ecological divergence are correlated with evolution of morphological disparity, suggesting that these axes of divergence may not be tightly linked. Finally, we reveal evidence of repeated convergence in sympatry that suggests niche complementarity. These findings reflect the dynamic history of Antarctic marine habitats, and may guide hypotheses of diversification dynamics in environments characterized by periodic disturbance.",

    "abstract": "MPI directly detects superparamagnetic iron oxides (SPIONs), which should enable precise, accurate, and linear quantification. However, selecting a region of interest (ROI) has strong effects on MPI quantification results. Ideally, ROI selection should be simple, user-independent, and widely applicable. In this work, we describe and compare four MPI ROI selection methods and assess their performance in vitro and in vivo. To explore the effect of ROI selection, ten ferucarbotran phantoms were imaged, each contained the same amount of iron but varied in volume. Three users tested the accuracy of the ROI methods for quantification of these samples. Lastly, the four ROI methods were applied to quantify ferucarbotran in vivo after intravenous, intramuscular, and subcutaneous injections in mice. We demonstrate that each ROI method has strengths. We conclude there is an important trade-off between ROI size and the accuracy of iron quantification, therefore the choice of ROI selection method for each study must be carefully informed.",

    "abstract": "A 50 kg-scale high solids anaerobic digestor comprising six sequentially-fed leach beds with a leachate recirculation system and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor was operated at 37{degrees}C for 88 weeks. The feedstock contained a constant fibre fraction (a mix of cardboard, boxboard, newsprint, and fine paper) and varying proportions of food waste. Significantly enhanced co-digestion and methane production from the fibres was observed as the proportion of FW was increased. The most abundant 16S rRNA amplicon sequence variant (ASV), classified as Clostridium butyricum, was correlated with the amount of FW in the system and total methane yield. However, methane yield specifically from the fibre fraction was significantly correlated with organisms classified as Candidatus Roizmanbacteria and Spirochaetaceae. These ASVs together with ASVs classified as Anaerovorax and Methanoculleus correlated strongly to other ASVs in the microbial community, suggesting these are vitally important for ecosystem function and methane production. In addition, tracing the fate of microbes derived from incoming food waste helped to diagnose a poor batch of bulking agent.\n\nTable of Contents (TOC)/ Abstract Art\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487789v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2a191forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d7497corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@119a43aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6d056e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The propulsion of mammalian spermatozoa during reproduction relies on the spontaneous periodic oscillation of their flagella. These oscillations are driven internally by the coordinated action of ATP-powered dynein motors that exert active sliding forces between microtubule doublets, resulting in bending waves that propagate along the flagellum and enable locomotion of the cell through the viscous medium. In this work, we present a chemomechanical model of a freely swimming spermatozoon that uses a sliding-control model of the flagellar axoneme capturing the coupling of motor kinetics with elastic deformations and accounts for the effect of non-local hydrodynamic interactions between the sperm head and flagellum. Nonlinear simulations of the model equations are shown to produce realistic beating patterns and swimming trajectories, which we analyze as a function of sperm number and motor activity. Our results demonstrate that the swimming velocity does not vary monotonically with dynein activity, but instead displays two local maxima corresponding to distinct modes of swimming, each characterized by qualitatively different waveforms and trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Plants can send long distance cell-to-cell signals from a single tissue subjected to stress to the entire plant. This ability is termed  systemic signaling and is essential for plant acclimation to stress and/or defense against pathogens. Several signaling mechanisms are associated with systemic signaling, including the reactive oxygen species (ROS) wave, calcium wave, hydraulic wave, and electric signals. The ROS wave coordinates multiple physiological, molecular, and metabolic responses among different parts of the plant, and is essential for systemic acquired acclimation (SAA) to stress. In addition, it is linked with several plants hormones, including jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA). However, how these plant hormones modulate the ROS wave and whether they are required for SAA is not clear. Here we report that SA and JA play antagonistic roles in modulating the ROS wave. While SA augments the ROS wave, JA suppresses it, during responses to a local wounding or high light (HL) stress treatments. We further show that ethylene and ABA are essential for the regulation of the ROS wave during systemic responses to a local wounding treatment. Interestingly, we found that the redox-response protein NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED PROTEIN 1 (NPR1) is required for systemic ROS accumulation in response to wounding or HL stress, as well as for SAA to HL stress. Taken together, our findings suggests that an interplay between JA and SA could regulate systemic signaling and SAA during responses of plants to abiotic stress or wounding.\n\nOne sentence summaryAn antagonistic interaction between SA and JA attenuates the accumulation of ROS in local and systemic tissues during responses of plants to light stress or wounding.",

    "abstract": "When the visual environment changes, vision adapts in order to maintain accurate perception. For repeatedly encountered environmental changes, the visual system may learn to adjust immediately, a process called \"visual mode switching\". For example, following experience with red glasses, participants report the glasses redness fades instantly when they put the glasses on. Here we tested: 1) whether once-daily experience suffices for learning to switch visual modes, and 2) whether effects of mode-switching apply to most stimuli affected by the environmental change. In Experiment 1, twelve participants wore bright red glasses for a single 5-hr period each day, for 5 days; and we tested for changes in the perception of unique yellow, which contains neither red nor green. In Experiment 2, we tested how mode switching affects larger parts of the color space. Thirteen participants donned and removed the glasses multiple times a day, for 5 days; and we used a dissimilarity rating task to measure and track perception of many different colors. Across days, immediately upon donning the glasses, the world appeared less and less reddish (Experiment 1), and colors across the whole color space appeared more and more normal (Experiment 2). These results indicate that mode switching can be learned from a once-daily experience, and it applies to most stimuli in a given environment. These findings may help to predict when and how mode switching occurs outside the laboratory.",

    "abstract": "Yeasts generally grow with a highly glycolytic metabolism and restrain mitochondrial biogenesis except for some Fe/S proteins. Respiratory mitochondrial functions and biosynthesis pathways are well studied, however how cells coordinate basal fermentative mitochondrial functions is not fully understood. We show that a part of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, which preferentially translated in monosomes, are regulated by Puf3p upon glucose-rich media. Especially, of those monosome-enriched nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, CAT5/COQ7 mRNA has a variant of the canonical Puf3p binding site on its 3-UTR. Western blot analysis showed that Puf3p represses the translation of Cat5p regardless of fermentable or respiratory media. In vitro binding assay revealed that Puf3p directly binds to CAT5 mRNA via the non-canonical Puf3p binding site.\n\nMutants harboring the substitution of the non-canonical Puf3p binding site in CAT5 mRNA grew normally but impaired Cat5p expressions apparently, indicating CAT5 mRNA is a bona fide Puf3p target. Overall, Puf3p, a general key modulator for nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs, fine-tunes translation of a subset of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial mRNAs including mRNAs with non-canonical Puf3p binding sites under the fermentation. This may be required to keeping the fundamental functions of yeast mitochondria at proper levels.",

    "abstract": "Electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) can generate high-resolution views of cells with faithful preservation of molecular structure. In situ cryo-EM, therefore, has enormous potential to reveal the atomic details of biological processes in their native context. However, in practice, the utility of in situ cryo-EM is limited by the difficulty of reliably locating and confidently identifying molecular targets (particles) and their conformational states in the crowded cellular environment. We recently showed that 2DTM, a fine-grained template-based search applied to cryo-EM micrographs, can localize particles in two-dimensional views of cells with high precision. Here we demonstrate that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) observed with 2DTM can be used to differentiate related complexes in focused ion beam (FIB)-milled cell sections. We apply this method in two contexts to locate and classify related intermediate states of 60S ribosome biogenesis in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell nucleus. In the first, we separate the nuclear pre-60S population from the cytoplasmic mature 60S population, using the subcellular localization to validate assignment. In the second, we show that relative 2DTM SNRs can be used to separate mixed populations of nuclear pre-60S that are not visually separable. We use a maximum likelihood approach to define the probability of each particle belonging to each class, thereby establishing a statistic to describe the confidence of our classification. Without the need to generate 3D reconstructions, 2DTM can be applied even when only a few target particles exist in a cell.",
