    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma (GB) is the most severe form of brain cancer, with a 12-15 month median survival. Surgical resection, temozolomide (TMZ) treatment, and radiotherapy (RT) remain the primary therapeutic options for GB, and no new therapies have been introduced in recent years. This therapeutic standstill is primarily due to preclinical approaches that do not fully respect the complexity of GB cell biology and fail to test efficiently anti-cancer treatments. Therefore, better treatment screening approaches are needed. In this study, we have developed a novel functional precision medicine approach to test the response to anticancer treatments in organoids derived from the resected tumors of glioblastoma patients.\n\nMethodsGB organoids were grown for a short period of time to prevent any genetic and morphological evolution and divergence from the tumor of origin. We chose metabolic imaging by NAD(P)H fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) to predict early and non-invasively ex-vivo anti-cancer treatment responses of GB organoids. TMZ was used as the benchmark drug to validate the approach. Whole-transcriptome and whole-exome analyses were then performed to characterize tumor cases stratification.\n\nResultsOur functional precision medicine approach was completed within one week after surgery and two groups of TMZ Responder and Non Responder tumors were identified. FLIM-based metabolic tumor stratification was well-reflected at the molecular level, confirming the validity of our approach, highlighting also new target genes associated with TMZ treatment and identifying a new 17 gene molecular signature associated with survival. The number of promoter methylated tumors for the MGMT gene was higher in the responsive group, as expected, however, some non-methylated tumor cases turned out to be nevertheless responsive to TMZ, suggesting that our procedure could be synergistic with the classical MGMT methylation biomarker.\n\nConclusionsFor the first time, FLIM-based metabolic imaging was used on ex-vivo live glioblastoma organoids. Unlike other approaches, ex-vivo patient-tailored drug response is performed at an early stage of tumor culturing with no animal involvement and with minimal tampering with the original tumor cytoarchitecture. This functional precision medicine approach can be exploited in a range of clinical and laboratory settings to improve the clinical management of GB patients and implemented on other cancers as well.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of short tandem repeats (STRs) in the human genome underlies over fifty genetic disorders. A common pathological feature of repeat RNAs is their propensity to aggregate in cells. While these RNA aggregates have been shown to cause toxicity by sequestering RNA-binding proteins, the molecular mechanism of repeat RNA aggregation remains unclear. Here we devised a generalizable method to efficiently generate long tandem repeat DNAs de novo and applied it to systematically determine the sequence features underlying RNA aggregation. Live-cell imaging of repeat RNAs indicated that aggregation was mainly driven by multivalent RNA-RNA interactions via either canonical or noncanonical base pairs. While multiple short runs of two consecutive base pairs were sufficient, longer runs of consecutive base pairs such as those formed by a neurodegeneration-associated hexanucleotide repeat further enhanced aggregation. In summary, our study provides a unifying model for the molecular basis of repeat RNA aggregation and a generalizable approach for identifying the sequence and structural determinants of repeat RNA properties.",

    "abstract": "From the 15th to the 19th century, the Trans-Atlantic Slave-Trade (TAST) influenced the genetic and cultural diversity of numerous populations. We explore genomic and linguistic data from the nine islands of Cabo Verde, the earliest European colony of the era in Africa, a major Slave-Trade platform between the 16th and 19th centuries, and a previously uninhabited location ideal for investigating early admixture events between Europeans and Africans. Using local-ancestry inference approaches, we find that genetic admixture in Cabo Verde occurred primarily between Iberian and certain Senegambian populations, although forced and voluntary migrations to the archipelago involved numerous other populations. Inter-individual genetic and linguistic variation recapitulates the geographic distribution of individuals birth-places across Cabo Verdean islands, following an isolation-by-distance model with reduced genetic and linguistic effective dispersals within the archipelago, and suggesting that Kriolu language variants have developed together with genetic divergences at very reduced geographical scales. Furthermore, based on approximate bayesian computation inferences of highly complex admixture histories, we find that admixture occurred early on each island, long before the 18th-century massive TAST deportations triggered by the expansion of the plantation economy in Africa and the Americas, and after this era mostly during the abolition of the TAST and of slavery in European colonial empires. Our results illustrate how shifting socio-cultural relationships between enslaved and non-enslaved communities during and after the TAST, shaped enslaved-African descendants genomic diversity and structure on both sides of the Atlantic.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance and tolerance to pathogen infection may present the opportunity to develop novel interventions. Resistance is the absence of clinical disease with low pathogen burden, while tolerance is minimal clinical disease in the face of high pathogen burden. Salmonella is a worldwide health concern. We studied 18 strains of Collaborative Cross mice that survive acute Salmonella Typhimurium (STm) infections. We infected these strains orally and monitored them for three weeks post-infection. Five strains cleared STm by the end of the experiment (resistant), while 6 strains maintained a bacterial load and survived to the end of the experiment (tolerant). The remaining 7 strains survived longer than 7 days but succumbed to infection before the end of the study period and were called \"delayed susceptible\" to differentiate them from strains that do not survive to day 7 (susceptible). Tolerant strains were colonized in Peyers patches, mesenteric lymph node, spleen and liver, while resistant strains had significantly reduced bacterial colonization. Tolerant strains had lower pre-infection core body temperatures than both delayed susceptible and resistant strains and had disrupted circadian patterns of body temperature post-infection sooner than resistant strains. Tolerant strains had higher circulating total white blood cells than resistant strains, driven by increased numbers of neutrophils. Tolerant strains had more severe tissue damage and higher circulating levels of MCP-1 and IFN-{gamma}, but lower levels of ENA-78 than resistant strains. QTL analysis revealed 1 significant association and 6 suggestive associations. RNA-seq analysis identified 22 genes that are differentially regulated in tolerant versus resistant animals that overlapped with the QTLs we identified and allowed us to identify the top 5 canonical pathways. Fibrinogen genes (Fga, Fgb, and Fgg) were found across the QTL, RNA, and top canonical pathways making them the best candidate genes for differentiating tolerance and resistance.\n\nAuthor SummaryAn infected host can respond in multiple ways to bacterial infection including resistance and tolerance. Resistance is a decrease in pathogen load, while in tolerance mild clinical signs are present despite high pathogen load. We infected a collection of 18 strains of genetically diverse mice with Salmonella Typhimurium for up to three weeks. Five strains were resistant, 6 strains were tolerant, and the remaining 7 strains survived an intermediate amount of time (\"delayed susceptible\"). Tolerant strains maintained bacterial load across several organs, while resistant strains reduced bacterial load. Tolerant strains had the lowest pre-infection core body temperatures and the most rapid disruption in circadian patterns of body temperature post-infection. Tolerant strains had higher circulating neutrophils, higher circulating levels of MCP-1 and IFN-{gamma}, but lower levels of ENA-78 than resistant strains, in addition to more severe tissue damage than resistant strains. QTL analysis revealed multiple associated regions, and gene expression analysis identified 22 genes that are differentially regulated in tolerant versus resistant animals in these regions. Fibrinogen genes (Fga, Fgb, and Fgg) were found across the QTL, RNA, and top canonical pathways making them the best candidate genes for differentiating tolerance and resistance.",

    "abstract": "Extracellular vesicle (EV) research has grown rapidly in recent years, largely due to the potential use of EVs as liquid biopsy biomarkers or therapeutics. However, in-depth characterisation and validation of EVs produced using conventional in vitro cultures can be challenging due to the large area of cell monolayers and volumes of culture media required. To overcome this obstacle, multiple bioreactor designs have been tested for EV production with varying success, but the consistency of EVs produced over time in these systems has not been reported previously. In this study, we demonstrate that several breast cancer cell lines of different subtypes can be cultured simultaneously in space, resource, and time efficient manner using CELLine AD 1000 systems, allowing the consistent production of vast amounts of EVs for downstream experimentation. We report an improved workflow used for inoculating, maintaining, and monitoring the bioreactors, their EV production, and the characterisation of the EVs produced. Lastly, our proteomic analyses of the EVs produced throughout the lifetime of the bioreactors show that core EV-associated proteins are relatively consistent, with few minor variations over time, and that tracking the production of EVs may be a convenient method for indirectly monitoring the bioreactors health. These findings will aid future studies requiring the simultaneous production of large amounts of EVs from several cell lines of different subtypes of a disease and other EV biomanufacturing applications.",

    "abstract": "Phagocytosis, the biological process in which cells ingest large particles such as bacteria, is a key component of the innate immune response. Fc{gamma} receptor (Fc{gamma}R)-mediated phagocytosis is initiated when these receptors are activated after binding immunoglobulin G (IgG). Receptor activation initiates a signaling cascade that leads to the formation of the phagocytic cup and culminates with ingestion of the foreign particle. In the experimental system termed \"frustrated phagocytosis\", cells attempt to internalize micropatterned disks of IgG. Cells that engage in frustrated phagocytosis form \"rosettes\" of actin-enriched structures called podosomes around the IgG disk. The mechanism that generates the rosette pattern is unknown. We present data that supports the involvement of Cdc42, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, in pattern formation. Cdc42 acts downstream of receptor activation, upstream of actin polymerization, and is known to play a role in polarity establishment. Reaction-diffusion models for GTPase spatiotemporal dynamics exist. We demonstrate how the addition of negative feedback and minor changes to these models can generate the experimentally observed rosette pattern of podosomes. We show that this pattern formation can occur through two general mechanisms. In the first mechanism, an intermediate species forms a ring of high activity around the IgG disk, which then promotes rosette organization. The second mechanism does not require initial ring formation but relies on spatial gradients of intermediate chemical species that are selectively activated over the IgG patch. Finally, we analyze the models to suggest experiments to test their validity.\n\nAuthor SummaryPhagocytosis, the process by which cells ingest foreign bodies, plays an important role in innate immunity. Phagocytosis is initiated when antibodies coating the surface of a foreign body are recognized by immune cells, such as macrophages. To study early events in phagocytosis, we used \"frustrated phagocytosis\", an experimental system in which antibodies are micropatterned in disks on a cover slip. The cytoskeleton of cells attempting to phagocytose these disks organizes into \"rosette\" patterns around the disks. To investigate mechanisms that underlie rosette formation we turned to mathematical modeling based on reaction-diffusion equations. Building on existing models for polarity establishment, our analysis revealed two mechanisms for rosette formation. In the first scenario an initial ring of an intermediate signaling molecule forms around the disk, while in the second scenario rosette formation is driven by gradients of positive and negative pathway regulators that are activated over the disk. Finally, we analyze our models to suggest experiments for testing these mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Touch is perceived most pleasant when delivered at velocities known to optimally activate C Tactile afferents. At the group level, pleasantness ratings of touch delivered at velocities in the range 0.3-30 cm/s follows an inverted-U shape curve, with maximum pleasantness between 1 and 10 cm/s. However, the prevalence, reliability, and stability of this function at the individual level and across skin types remains unknown. Here, we tested a range of seven velocities delivered with a soft brush, on both hairy and non-hairy skin in 123 participants. We showed that the relationship between pleasantness and velocity of touch is significantly best described by a negative quadratic model at the individual level in the majority of participants both on hairy (67.1%) and non-hairy skin (62.6%). Higher interoceptive accuracy and self-reported depression were related to a better fit of the quadratic model and to the steepness of the curve, respectively. The prevalence of the quadratic model was stable across body sites (62.6%), across two experimental sessions (73-78%,), and regardless of the number of trials. Thus, the individual perception of tactile pleasantness follows a characteristic velocity-dependent function across skin types and shows trait characteristics, making it a possible biomarker for mental health disorders.",

    "abstract": "Immotile cilia of crown cells at the node of mouse embryos are required for sensing of a leftward fluid flow1 that gives rise to the breaking of left-right (L-R) symmetry2. The flow-sensing mechanism has long remained elusive, however, with both mechanosensing and chemosensing models having been proposed1, 3-5. Here we show that immotile cilia at the mouse node respond to mechanical force. In the presence of a leftward flow, immotile cilia on the left side of the node bend toward the ventral side whereas those on the right side bend toward the dorsal side. Application of mechanical stimuli to immotile cilia along the dorsoventral axis by optical tweezers induced Ca2+ transients and degradation of Dand5 mRNA--the first known L-R asymmetric molecular events--in the targeted cells. The Pkd2 channel protein was found to be preferentially localized to the dorsal side of immotile cilia on both left and right sides of the node, and the observed induction of Ca2+ transients preferentially by mechanical stimuli directed toward the ventral side could explain the differential response of immotile cilia to the directional flow. Our results thus suggest that immotile cilia at the node sense the direction of fluid flow in a manner dependent on a flow-generated mechanical force.",

    "abstract": "Inorganic pyrophosphatase (iPPase) is an enzyme that cleaves pyrophosphate into two phosphate molecules. This enzyme is an essential component of in vitro transcription (IVT) reactions for RNA preparation as it prevents pyrophosphate from precipitating with magnesium, ultimately increasing the rate of the IVT reaction. Large-scale RNA production is often required for biochemical and biophysical characterization studies of RNA, therefore requiring large amounts of IVT reagents. Commercially purchased iPPase is often the most expensive component of any IVT reaction. In this paper, we demonstrate that iPPase can be produced in large quantities and of high quality using a reasonably generic laboratory facility and that laboratory-purified iPPase is as effective as commercially available iPPase. Furthermore, using size-exclusion chromatography coupled with multi-angle light scattering and dynamic light scattering (SEC-MALS-DLS), analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), we demonstrate that yeast iPPase can form tetramers and hexamers in solution as well as the enzymatically active dimer. Our work provides a robust protocol for labs involved with RNA in vitro transcription to efficiently produce active iPPase, significantly reducing the financial strain of large-scale RNA production.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWe show an easy two-step purification procedure to efficiently produce large quantities of iPPase, an expensive component of IVT reactions. Laboratory-produced iPPase can significantly reduce the financial strain on research labs that rely on large-scale RNA production for experiments. Furthermore, we show for the first time, using a combination of orthogonal biophysical techniques, that yeast iPPase assembles into higher-order oligomers similar to bacterial iPPase.",

    "abstract": "Modelling evolutionary elements inherent in protein sequences, emerging from one clade into another of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, would provide insights to augment our understanding of its impact on public health and may help in formulating better strategies to contain its spread. Deep learning methods have been used to model protein sequences for SARS-CoV-2 viruses. A few significant drawbacks in these studies include being deficient in modelling end-to-end protein sequences, modelling only those genomic positions that show high activity and upsampling the number of sequences at each genomic position for balancing the frequency of mutations. To mitigate such drawbacks, the current approach uses a generative model, an encoder-decoder neural network, to learn the natural progression of spike protein sequences through adjacent clades of the phylogenetic tree of Nextstrain clades. Encoder transforms a set of spike protein sequences from the source clade (20A) into its latent representation. Decoder uses the latent representation, along with Gaussian distributed noise, to generate a different set of protein sequences that are closer to the target clade (20B). The source and target clades are adjacent nodes in the phylogenetic tree of different evolving clades of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Sequences of amino acids are generated, for the entire length, at each genomic position using the latent representation of the amino acid generated at a previous step. Using trained models, protein sequences from the source clade are used to generate sequences that form a collection of evolved sequences belonging to all children clades of the source clade. A comparison of this predicted evolution (between source and generated sequences) of proteins with the true evolution (between source and target sequences) shows a high pearson correlation (> 0.7). Moreover, the distribution of the frequencies of substitutions per genomic position, including high- and low-frequency positions, in source-target sequences and source-generated sequences exhibit a high resemblance (pearson correlation > 0.7). In addition, the model partially predicts a few substitutions at specific genomic positions for the sequences of unseen clades (20J (Gamma)) where they show little activity during training. These outcomes show the potential of this approach in learning the latent mechanism of evolution of SARS-CoV-2 viral sequences.\n\nCodebasehttps://github.com/anuprulez/clade_prediction",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous environmental mold that causes significant mortality particularly amongst immunocompromised patients. The detection of the Aspergillus-derived carbohydrate galactomannan in patient sera and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid is the major biomarker used to detect A. fumigatus infection in clinical medicine. Despite the clinical relevance of this carbohydrate, we lack a fundamental understanding of how galactomannan is recognized by the immune system and its consequences. Galactomannan is composed of a linear mannan backbone with galactofuranose sidechains and is found both attached to the cell surface of Aspergillus and as a soluble carbohydrate in the extracellular milieu. In this study, we utilized fungal-like particles composed of highly purified Aspergillus galactomannan to identify a C-type lectin host receptor for this fungal carbohydrate. We identified a novel and specific interaction between Aspergillus galactomannan and the C-type lectin receptor Dectin-2. We demonstrate that galactomannan bound to Dectin-2 and induced Dectin-2 dependent signaling including activation of spleen tyrosine kinase and potent TNF production. Deficiency of Dectin-2 increased immune cell recruitment to the lungs but was dispensable for survival in a mouse model of pulmonary aspergillosis. Our results identify a novel interaction between galactomannan and Dectin-2 and demonstrate that Dectin-2 is a receptor for galactomannan which leads to a pro-inflammatory immune response in the lung.\n\nIMPORTANCEAspergillus fumigatus is a fungal pathogen that causes serious and often fatal disease in humans. The surface of Aspergillus is composed of complex sugar molecules. Recognition of these carbohydrates by immune cells by carbohydrate lectin receptos can lead to clearance of the infection or, in some cases, benefit the fungus by dampening the host response. Galactomannan is a carbohydrate that is part of the cell surface of Aspergillus but is also released during infection and is found in patient lungs as well as their bloodstreams. The significance of our research is that we have identified a mammalian immune cell receptor that recognizes, binds, and signals in response to galactomannan. These results enhance our understanding of how this carbohydrate interacts with the immune system at the site of infection and will lead to broader understanding of how release of galactomannan by Aspergillus effects the immune response in infected patients.",

    "abstract": "Influenza associated bacterial super-infections have devastating impacts on the lung and can result in increased risk of mortality. New strains of influenza circulate throughout the population yearly promoting the establishment of immune memory. Nearly all individuals have some degree of influenza memory prior to adulthood. Due to this we sought to understand the role of immune memory during bacterial super-infections. An influenza heterotypic immunity model was established using influenza A/PR/8/34 and A/X31. We report here that influenza experienced mice are more resistant to secondary bacterial infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as determined by wasting, bacterial burden, pulmonary inflammation, and lung leak, despite significant ongoing lung remodeling. Multidimensional flow cytometry and lung transcriptomics revealed significant alterations in the lung environment in influenza-experienced mice compared with naive animals. These include changes in the lung monocyte and T cell compartments, characterized by increased expansion of influenza tetramer specific CD8+ T cells. The protection that was seen in memory experienced mouse model is associated with the reduction in inflammatory mechanisms making the lung less susceptible to damage and subsequent bacterial colonization. These findings provide insight into how influenza heterotypic immunity re-shapes the lung environment and the immune response to a re-challenge event, which is highly relevant to the context of human infection.",

    "abstract": "Proper regulation of the bacterial cell envelope is critical for cell survival. Identification and characterization of enzymes that maintain cell envelope homeostasis is crucial, as they can be targets for effective antibiotics. In this study, we have identified a novel enzyme, called EstG, whose activity protects cells from a variety of lethal assaults in the -proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. Despite homology to transpeptidase family cell wall enzymes and an ability to protect against cell wall-targeting antibiotics, EstG does not demonstrate biochemical activity towards cell wall substrates. Instead, EstG is genetically connected to the periplasmic enzymes OpgH and BglX, responsible for synthesis and hydrolysis of osmoregulated periplasmic glucans (OPGs), respectively. The crystal structure of EstG revealed similarities to esterases and transesterases, and we demonstrated esterase activity of EstG in vitro. Using biochemical fractionation, we identified a cyclic hexamer of glucose as a likely substrate of EstG. This molecule is the first OPG described in Caulobacter and establishes a novel class of OPGs, the regulation and modification of which is important for stress survival and adaptation to fluctuating environments. Our data indicate that EstG, BglX, and OpgH comprise a previously unknown OPG pathway in Caulobacter. Ultimately, we propose that EstG is a novel enzyme that, instead of acting on the cell wall, acts on cyclic OPGs to provide resistance to a variety of cellular stresses.",

    "abstract": "Rotaviruses (RVs) are one of the main causes of severe gastroenteritis, diarrhea, and death in children and young animals. Although suckling mice prove to be highly useful small animal models of RV infection and pathogenesis, direct visualization tools are lacking to track the temporal dynamics of RV replication and transmissibility in vivo. Here, we report the generation of the first recombinant murine RV that encodes a Nano-Luciferase reporter (NLuc) using a newly optimized RV reverse genetics system. The NLuc-expressing RV was replication-competent in cell culture and both infectious and virulent in neonatal mice in vivo. Strong luciferase signals were detected in the proximal and distal small intestines, colon, and mesenteric lymph nodes. We showed, via a noninvasive in vivo imaging system, that RV intestinal replication peaked at day 2 and day 5 post infection. Moreover, we successfully tracked RV transmission to uninoculated littermates as early as 3 days post infection, 1 day prior to clinically apparent diarrhea and 3 days prior to detectable fecal RV shedding in the uninoculated littermates. We also observed significantly increased viral replication in Stat1 knockout mice that lack the host interferon signaling. Our results suggest that the NLuc RV represents a non-lethal powerful tool for the studies of tissue tropism and host and viral factors that regulate RV replication and spread, as providing a new mechanism to facilitate the testing of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future.",

    "abstract": "During colonization of the Hawaiian bobtail squid (Euprymna scolopes), Vibrio fischeri bacteria undergo a lifestyle transition from a planktonic motile state in the environment to a biofilm state in host mucus. Cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) is a cytoplasmic signaling molecule that is important for regulating motility-biofilm transitions in many bacterial species. V. fischeri encodes 50 proteins predicted to synthesize and/or degrade c-di-GMP, but a role for c-di-GMP regulation during host colonization has not been investigated. We examined strains exhibiting either low or high levels of c-di-GMP during squid colonization and found that while a low c-di-GMP strain had no colonization defect, a high c-di-GMP strain was severely impaired. Expression of a heterologous c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase restored colonization, demonstrating that the effect is due to high c-di-GMP levels. In the constitutive high c-di-GMP state, colonizing V. fischeri exhibited reduced motility, altered biofilm aggregate morphology, and a regulatory interaction where transcription of one polysaccharide locus is inhibited by the presence of the other polysaccharide. Our results highlight the importance of proper c-di-GMP regulation during beneficial animal colonization, illustrate multiple pathways regulated by c-di-GMP in the host, and uncover an interplay of multiple exopolysaccharide systems in host-associated aggregates.\n\nIMPORTANCEThere is substantial interest in studying cyclic diguanylate (c-di-GMP) in pathogenic and environmental bacteria, which has led to an accepted paradigm in which high c-di-GMP levels promote biofilm formation and reduce motility. However, considerably less focus has been placed on understanding how this compound contributes to beneficial colonization. Using the Vibrio fischeri-Hawaiian bobtail squid study system, we took advantage of recent genetic advances in the bacterium to modulate c-di-GMP levels and measure colonization and track c-di-GMP phenotypes in a symbiotic interaction. Studies in the animal host revealed a c-di-GMP-dependent genetic interaction between two distinct biofilm polysaccharides, Syp and cellulose, that was not evident in culture-based studies: elevated c-di-GMP altered the composition and abundance of the in vivo biofilm by decreasing syp transcription due to increased cellulose synthesis. This study reveals important parallels between pathogenic and beneficial colonization and additionally identifies c-di-GMP-dependent regulation that occurs specifically in the squid host.",

Inter-filament interactions are electrostatic, which facilitate filament sliding upon VPS4-mediated polymer remodeling.

Here we show that both Piezo1 and 2 also exhibit concentrated intracellular localization at centrosomes. Both Piezo1 and 2 loss-of-function and Piezo1 activation by the small molecule Yoda1 produced supernumerary centrosomes due to inappropriate centriole disengagement. Using a centrosome-localized GCaMP Ca2+-sensitive reporter, we show that perturbations in Piezo modulate Ca2+ local concentration at centrosomes. We designed a photoactivable Yoda1 analog (caged-Yoda1) and revealed that its photoactivation specifically at centrosomes leads to rapid premature centriole disengagement within minutes. We identified the sorting nexin Snx5, which is involved in endocytic uptake and trafficking, as a protein-interactor with the conserved Piezo C-terminal domain, and Snx5 also co-localizes with Piezo1 and 2 at centrosomes. Moreover, inhibition of Polo-like-kinase 1 (PLK1) abolishes Yoda1-induced centriole disengagement. Collectively, these data suggest that Piezo1 and 2 in pericentrosomal endosomes control centrosome integrity, likely by maintaining local Ca2+ within a defined range through mechanotransduction of cell intrinsic forces from microtubules.",

    "abstract": "The precise control of phagosome maturation is critical for innate and adaptive immunity, determining whether phagocytosed material is destroyed or used to present antigens. We observed previously that non-fusogenic contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and phagosomes, called membrane contact sites (MCS), are tethered by the calcium regulator STIM1 and fine-tune phagosomal maturation. The secretory pathway SNARE protein Sec22b has been implicated in controlling phagocytosis, phagosome maturation and antigen presentation, though its effects are controversial, and its mechanism of action poorly understood. Recently, Sec22b was shown to tether MCS at the plasma membrane without mediating membrane fusion. Here, we show that Sec22b localizes to and regulates the frequency of ER-phagosome contacts independently of STIM proteins. Sec22b knockdown and overexpression of a an MCS-disrupting mutant Sec22b-P33 induced only mild or no effect on global and local calcium signalling. However, Sec22b knockdown altered phagosomal phospholipids including PI(3)P, PI(4)P and PS, but not PI(4,5)P2. Increased PI(4)P in shSec22b cells was rescued by re-expression of Sec22b or the artificial MCS tether MAPPER but not the P33 mutant. Moreover, Sec22b co-precipitated and was co-recruited to phagosomes with the PS/PI(4)P lipid exchange protein ORP8. Expression of wild-type, but not mutant ORP8, also rescued phagosomal PI(4)P. Concordantly, Sec22b, MAPPER and ORP8 but not P33 or the ORP8 mutant decreased phagolysosome fusion in shSec22b cells. These results clarify a novel mechanism through which Sec22b controls phagosome maturation and beg a reassessment of the relative contribution of Sec22b-mediated fusion versus tethering to phagosome biology.",

    "abstract": "Clades of marine fishes exhibit many patterns of diversification, ranging from relatively constant throughout time to rapid changes in the rates of speciation and extinction. The goatfishes (Syngnatharia: Mullidae) are a family of marine, reef associated fishes with a relatively recent origin, distributed globally in tropical and temperate waters. Despite their abundance and economic importance, the goatfishes remain one of the few coral reef families for which the species level relationships have not been examined using genomic techniques. Here we use phylogenomic analysis of ultra-conserved elements (UCE) and exon data to resolve a well-supported, time-calibrated phylogeny for 72 species of goatfishes, supporting a recent crown age of the goatfishes at 21.9 million years ago. We used this framework to test hypotheses about the associations among body shape morphometrics, taxonomy, and phylogeny, as well as to explore relative diversification rates across the phylogeny. Body shape was strongly associated with generic-level taxonomy of goatfishes, with morphometric analyses showing evidence for high phylogenetic signal across all morphotypes. Rates of diversification in this clade reveal a recent sharp increase in lineage accumulation, with 92% of the goatfish species sampled across all clades and major body plans having originated in just the past 5 million years. We suggest that habitat diversity in the early Pliocene oceans and the generalist ecology of goatfishes are key factors in the unusual evolutionary tempo of the family Mullidae.",

Such codes have evolved at least four times in eukaryotes, twice among ciliates (Condylostoma magnum and Parduczia sp.). These have appeared to be isolated cases whose next closest relatives use conventional stop codons. However, little genomic data have been published for the Karyorelictea, the ciliate class that contains Parduczia sp., and previous studies may have overlooked ambiguous codes because of their apparent rarity. We therefore analyzed single-cell transcriptomes from four of the six karyorelict families to determine their genetic codes. Reassignment of canonical stops to sense codons was inferred from codon frequencies in conserved protein domains, while the actual stop codon was predicted from full-length transcripts with intact 3-untranslated regions (3-UTRs). We found that all available karyorelicts use the Parduczia code, where canonical stops UAA and UAG are reassigned to glutamine, and UGA encodes either tryptophan or stop. Furthermore, a small minority of transcripts may use an ambiguous stop-UAA instead of stop-UGA. Given the ubiquity of karyorelicts in marine coastal sediments, ambiguous genetic codes are not mere marginal curiosities but a defining feature of a globally distributed and diverse group of eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "The aromatic side-chains of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan interact with their environments via both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. Determining the extent to which these contribute to protein function and stability is not possible with conventional mutagenesis. Serial fluorination of a given aromatic is a validated method in vitro and in silico to specifically alter electrostatic characteristics, but this approach is restricted to a select few experimental systems. Here, we report a new group of pyrrolysine-based aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs that enable the site-specific encoding of a varied spectrum of fluorinated phenylalanine amino acids in E. coli and mammalian (HEK 293T) cells. By allowing the cross-kingdom expression of proteins bearing these unnatural amino acids at biochemical scale, these tools will enable deconstruction of biological mechanisms which utilize aromatic-pi interactions in structural and cellular contexts.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThe aromatic side-chains of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan are crucial for protein function and pharmacology due to their hydrophobic and electrostatic contributions to catalytic centers and ligand-binding pockets. However, few experimental approaches can chemically assess the functional roles of aromatics in cellular environments. The accepted computational method for aromatic interrogation is via serial fluorination, which lacks an experimental correlate in bacterial or mammalian cell systems. We have identified a family of synthetases to encode multiple different types of fluorinated phenylalanine residues in E. coli and HEK cells via nonsense suppression. The efficiency of these synthetases is sufficient to support biochemical characterization and structural determination of proteins with site-specific incorporation of unnatural phenylalanine analogs.",

Excessive mitochondrial matrix Ca2+ is known to be deleterious due to opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) and consequent membrane potential dissipation, leading to mitochondrial swelling, rupture, and cell death. Moderate Ca2+ within the organelle, on the other hand, can directly or indirectly activate mitochondrial matrix enzymes, possibly impacting on ATP production. Here, we aimed to determine in a quantitative manner if extra or intramitochondrial Ca2+ modulate oxidative phosphorylation in mouse liver mitochondria and intact hepatocyte cell lines. To do so, we monitored the effects of more modest versus supra-physiological increases in cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+ on oxygen consumption rates. Isolated mitochondria present increased respiratory control ratios (a measure of oxidative phosphorylation efficiency) when incubated with low (2.4 {+/-} 0.6 M) and medium (22.0 {+/-} 2.4 M) Ca2+ concentrations in the presence of complex I-linked substrates pyruvate plus malate and -ketoglutarate, respectively, but not complex II-linked succinate. In intact cells, both low and high cytosolic Ca2+ led to decreased respiratory rates, while ideal rates were present under physiological conditions. High Ca2+ decreased mitochondrial respiration in a substrate-dependent manner, mediated by mPTP. Overall, our results uncover a Goldilocks effect of Ca2+ on liver mitochondria, with specific \"just right\" concentrations that activate oxidative phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "The tumor microenvironment (TME) consists of different cell types that secrete proteins and also control the extracellular concentration of ions and metabolites. Changes in these intra-tumoral analytes and conditions, including K+, glucose, and pH, have been described to alter the metabolic activity of cancer cells, promote tumor cell growth, and impair anti-tumor immunity. However, the mechanisms regulating ion and metabolite levels and their effects on certain characteristics of the TME are still poorly understood. Therefore, accurate determination and visualization of analyte or state changes in real time within the TME is desired.\n\nIn this study, we genetically combined FRET-based fluorescent biosensors with nanobodies (Nbs) and used them for targeted visualization and monitoring of extracellular changes in K+, pH, and glucose on cell surfaces. We demonstrated that these recombinant biosensors quantitatively visualize extracellular K+ alterations on multiple cancer and non-cancer cell lines and primary neurons. By implementing a HER2 specific Nb, we generated K+ and pH sensors, which retain their functionality and specifically stained HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Based on the successful technical development of several Nb-biosensor combinations, we anticipate that this approach can be easily extended to design other targeted biosensors. Such versatile probes will open new possibilities for the reliable study of extracellular analytes in advanced 3D cell models or even in vivo systems.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is critical for regulating gene expression, necessitating its accurate placement by enzymes such as the DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. Dysregulation of this process is known to cause aberrant development and oncogenesis, yet how DNMT3A is regulated holistically by its three domains remains challenging to study. Here we integrate base editing with a DNA methylation reporter to perform in situ mutational scanning of DNMT3A in cells. We identify mutations throughout the protein that perturb function, including ones at an interdomain interface that block allosteric activation. Unexpectedly, we also find mutations in the PWWP domain, a histone reader, that modulate enzyme activity despite preserving histone recognition and protein stability. These effects arise from altered PWWP domain DNA affinity, which we show is a noncanonical function required for full activity in cells. Our findings highlight mechanisms of interdomain crosstalk and demonstrate a generalizable strategy to probe sequence-activity relationships of nonessential chromatin regulators.",

    "abstract": "Microvessels are essential for tissue engineering and regeneration. In current methods, endothelial cells are usually cultured in commercially available media and form a monolayer of cell sheets on stiff substrates and a tubular structure when cultured with soft hydrogels. To mimic the microvessels in vivo, researchers usually coculture the endothelial cells and pericytes from different adult tissues or derived from pluripotent stem cells in a three-dimensional hydrogel. However, there is a challenge for these models to reflect tissue-specific characteristics due to the vascular heterogeneity throughout the body. Here, we established a culture model for expanding adult tubular microvessels on stiff substrates with endothelial cells and pericytes derived from the same tissue. We isolated microvessels from adult rat subcutaneous soft connective tissue and cultured them on regular plastic dishes. We performed a series of screenings and formulated a custom-made medium (Medium-X), containing mainly antioxidants and three small molecules, Chir99021, A83-01, and Y27632. Medium-X significantly promoted adult microvessel growth while maintaining their characteristic tubular morphology up to 8 weeks in vitro, contrary to the monolayer of endothelial cell sheets in the commercially available medium EGM2MV. Transcriptomic analysis showed that Medium-X maintained the tubular morphology of microvessels by promoting angiogenesis and vascular remodeling while suppressing oxidation and lipid metabolic pathways. The model presented in this study can be applied to other organs for expanding organ-specific microvessels for tissue engineering and vascular regeneration.",

    "abstract": "The control of eukaryotic gene expression is intimately connected to highly dynamic chromatin structures. Gene regulation relies on activator and repressor transcription factors (TFs) that induce local chromatin opening and closing. However, it is unclear how nucleus-wide chromatin organization responds dynamically to the activity of specific TFs. Here we examined how two TFs with opposite effects on local chromatin accessibility modulate chromatin dynamics nucleus-wide. We combine High-resolution Diffusion mapping (Hi-D) and Dense Flow reConstruction and Correlation (DFCC) in living cells to obtain an imaging-based, nanometer-scale analysis of local diffusion processes and long-range coordinated movements of both chromatin and TFs. We show that the expression of either an individual transcriptional activator (CDX2) or repressor (SIX6) increases local chromatin mobility nucleus-wide, yet induces opposite coherent chromatin motions at the micron scale. Hi-C analysis of higher-order chromatin structures shows that induction of CDX2 leads both to changes in local chromatin interactions and the distribution of A and B compartments, thus relating the dynamics of chromatin on the microscale with changes in compartmental structures. Given that inhibition of transcription initiation and elongation by RNA Pol II have almost no impact on the global chromatin dynamics induced by CDX2, we suggest that CDX2 alters chromatin structure independently of transcription. Our biophysical analysis shows that sequence-specific TFs mobilize long-range chromatin structure on multiple levels, providing evidence that local chromatin changes brought about by TFs can alter both the dynamics and the long-range organization of chromatin in living cells.",

    "abstract": "Structural predictions have matched the accuracy of experimental structures in the case of close homologues, outperformed docking methods for multimeric complexes and helped sampling the conformational landscape of transporters and receptors. Such successes prompt the question whether predictions can be used to relate experimental structures in the context of available knowledge. LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTR) constitute the most common family of bacterial regulators. Intriguingly, their experimental structures are remarkably diverse. The active species, composed of flexible monomers dimerizing through their N- and C-terminal domains in a circular arrangement, differ across LTTR, due to intrinsic sequence differences or because crystals stabilize diverse snapshots of a common dynamic mechanism. We have used AlphaFold2 (AF) to interrogate the experimental AtzR structure in the context of predictions guided towards the different hetero-multimeric conformations known for other LTTR. Our approach drives AF prediction with the structure-based selection of the information input through sequence alignment and template conformation, linked to examination of the energy with PISA and interactions with ALEPH.",

    "abstract": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD), a progressive skeletal muscle disorder, is epigenetically characterized by DNA hypomethylation of the D4Z4 repeats in the 4q35 region, which enables aberrant DUX4 expression. Sustainable DUX4 suppression is thus a promising therapeutic strategy by which to prevent disease progression, but most of the supposed methods to achieve this depend on the expression of a mediator biochemical entity that would potentially narrow the quality of life of individuals with FSHD in the clinical context. In this study, we report that by applying hit-and-run silencing with dCas9-mediated epigenetic editing targeting DNA hypomethylation on D4Z4 repeats, we could achieve the suppression of endogenous DUX4 in our FSHD patient-derived iPSC model. Notably, DNA methylation was significantly upregulated in FSHD cells and suppression effects were observed for at least two weeks after intervention, which was not the case with transient treatments of typical dCas9-KRAB alone. Off-target analysis showed that despite the potential genome-wide risk for DNA methylation, the impact on the transcriptome was limited. We propose that hit-and-run silencing could be a promising option to prevent disease progression with minimum intervention for individuals with FSHD, motivating further study for clinical development.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/487997v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (47K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19e85dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@672798org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@58717dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@83044b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

LAM-specific antibodies (Igs) have been developed by a variety of traditional and recombinant methods for potential use in a rapid diagnostic test (RDT). We evaluated the analytical performance of the TB LAM Igs to identify pairs that offer superior performance over existing urine LAM tests. We assessed 25 new and 4 existing Igs in a matrixed format using a multiplex electrochemiluminescence-based liquid immunoassay. A total of 841 paired Ig combinations were challenged with in vitro cultured LAM (cLAM) derived from MTB strains representing diverse phylogenetic lineages, alongside urinary LAM (uLAM) from the urine of adults with active pulmonary TB. Analytical sensitivity of down-selected Ig pairs was determined using MTB Aoyama-B cLAM, while diagnostic accuracy was determined using clinical samples. When testing cLAM, the reactivity of Ig pairs was similar across MTB lineages 1-4 but lineage 5:6 had significantly more reactivity among Ig pairs. Overall, 41 Ig pairs had a strong binding affinity to cLAM, as compared to the reference pair of S4-20/A194-01, and 28 Ig pairs therein exhibited a strong affinity for both cLAM and uLAM. Retrospective testing on clinical urine specimens demonstrated varying sensitivities (12-80%) and specificities (14-100%). The five top pairs had a similar analytical limit of detection to the reference pair but in four instances, the sensitivity and specificity with clinical uLAM samples was poor. Overall, epitopes presented by uLAM are different from cLAM, which may affect antibody performance when testing uLAM in patient samples. Several new Ig pairs had similar ranges of high sensitivity to cLAM but overall, there were no new candidate Ig pairs identified in this round of screening with increased performance with uLAM as compared to an existing optimal pair.",

We demonstrated else-where that purified {varepsilon}34 TSP possessed bacteria lytic property on S. newington. The {varepsilon}34 TSP has been shown via computational prediction to consist of parallel {beta}-helices like that of P22 TSP. These protein moieties are among the simplest repetitive structural elements in proteins. There exist extensive research on the folding behavior of {beta}-helix proteins, which also provides insight on how amyloid fibrils are generated since these proteins consist of similar parallel {beta}-helix motifs. One of the most significantly studied system for investigating protein folding is the from the Salmonella bacteriophage P22. The major component of this protein is a right-handed parallel {beta}-helix with 13 rungs. Initial in silico analysis of the {varepsilon}34 phage TSP indicates similar structural similarity to the P22 TSP. Our previous studies indicated that despite the similarities of the two proteins, P22 TSP shows higher resistance to proteases (e.g. trypsin) and heat compared to {varepsilon}34 TSP. In this study we further proof that {varepsilon}34 TSP is partially sensitive to proteinase K, whereas P22 TSP is completely resistant to this protein. Detailed analysis indicates that specific structural motifs of {varepsilon}34 TSP is insensitive to the protease, whereas other regions of the protein showed susceptibility to it.",

This binary response fails to explain the weak agonism of flagellins from commensal bacteria, raising the question of how TLR5 response is tuned. Here, we describe a novel class of flagellin-TLR5 interaction, termed silent recognition. Silent flagellins are weak agonists despite high affinity binding to TLR5. This dynamic response is tuned by TLR5-flagellin interaction distal to the site of pattern recognition. Silent flagellins are produced primarily by the abundant gut bacteria Lachnospiraceae and are enriched in non-Western populations. These findings provide a mechanism for the innate immune system to tolerate commensal-derived flagellins.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryTLR5 sensitively recognizes, but responds weakly to, flagellins from gut commensal bacteria.",

    "abstract": "Poly(rC)-binding protein 2 (PCBP2) was previously shown to bind to the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome; however, its precise role in the viral life cycle remained unclear. Herein, we found that PCBP2 does not directly affect viral entry, translation, genome stability, replication, or virion egress. Rather, our data suggests that endogenous PCBP2 normally limits virion assembly, thereby indirectly promoting translation and replication by increasing the translating/replicating pool of viral RNAs. Additionally, we found that an alternative RNA conformation (SLIIalt) was important for efficient virion assembly, but functions in a PCBP2-independent manner. The latter may explain why the Japanese fulminant hepatitis 1 isolate is able to produce infectious particles in cell culture, while other HCV isolates are lost in translation. Taken together, our results suggest that PCBP2 and SLIIalt independently modulate HCV genome packaging and alter the balance of viral RNAs in the translating/replicating pool and those engaged in virion assembly.\n\nGraphical Abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

We determined the molecular organization of ERMES within cells using integrative structural biology, combining quantitative live-imaging, cryo-correlative microscopy, subtomogram averaging and molecular modeling. ERMES assembles into approximately 25 discrete bridge-like complexes distributed irregularly across a contact site.

    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) is a non-selective Ca2+ permeable cation channel, which was originally cloned from human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). TRPA1-mediated Ca2+ entry is evoked by exposure to several chemicals, including allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), and a protective effect of TRPA1 activation in the development of cardiac fibrosis has been proposed. Yet, the function of TRPA1 in transforming growth factor {beta}1 (TGF-{beta}1)-driven fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation and the development of pulmonary fibrosis remains elusive. TRPA1 expression and function was analyzed in cultured primary HLFs, and mRNA levels were significantly reduced after adding TGF-{beta}1. Expression of genes encoding fibrosis markers, e.g. alpha smooth muscle actin (ACTA2), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (SERPINE1), fibronectin (FN1) and type I collagen (COL1A1) was increased after siRNA-mediated down-regulation of TRPA1-mRNA in HLFs. Moreover, AITC-induced Ca2+ entry in HLFs was decreased after TGF-{beta}1 treatment and by application of TRPA1 siRNAs, while AITC treatment alone did not reduce cell viability or enhanced apoptosis. Cell barrier function increased after addition of TRPA1 siRNAs or TGF-{beta}1 treatment. Most interestingly, AITC-induced TRPA1 activation augmented ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which might inhibit TGF-{beta}-receptor signaling. Our results suggest an inhibitory function of TRPA1 channels in TGF-{beta}1-driven fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation. Therefore, activation of TRPA1 channels might be protective during the development of pulmonary fibrosis in patients.",

    "abstract": "Type II DNA topoisomerases of the family A (Topo IIA) are present in all bacteria (DNA gyrase) and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, they play a major role in transcription, DNA replication, chromosome segregation and modulation of chromosome architecture. The origin of eukaryotic Topo IIA remains mysterious since they are very divergent from their bacterial homologues and have no orthologues in Archaea. Interestingly, eukaryotic Topo IIA have close homologues in viruses of the phylum Nucleocytoviricota, an expansive assemblage of large and giant viruses formerly known as the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV). Topo IIA are also encoded by some bacterioviruses of the class Caudoviricetes (tailed bacteriophages). To elucidate the origin of the eukaryotic Topo IIA, we performed in-depth phylogenetic analyses combining viral and cellular Topo IIA homologs. Topo IIA encoded by bacteria and eukaryotes form two monophyletic groups nested within Topo IIA encoded by Caudoviricetes and Nucleocytoviricota, respectively. Importantly, Nucleocytoviricota remained well separated from eukaryotes after removing both bacteria and Caudoviricetes from the dataset, indicating that the separation of Nucleocytoviricota and eukaryotes is probably not due to long branch attraction artefact. The topology of our tree suggests that the eukaryotic Topo IIA was probably acquired from an ancestral member of the Nucleocytoviricota of the class Megaviricetes, before the emergence of the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). This result further highlights a key role of these viruses in eukaryogenesis and suggests that early proto-eukaryotes used a Topo IIB instead of a Topo IIA for solving their DNA topological problems.",

    "abstract": "Balancing selection is a form of natural selection maintaining diversity at the sites it targets and at linked nucleotide sites. Due to selection favouring heterozygosity, it has the potential to facilitate the accumulation of a \"sheltered\" load of tightly linked recessive deleterious mutations. However, precisely evaluating the extent of these effects has remained challenging. Taking advantage of plant self-incompatibility as one of the best-understood examples of long-term balancing selection, we provide a highly resolved picture of the genomic extent of balancing selection on the sheltered genetic load. We used targeted genome resequencing to reveal polymorphism of the genomic region flanking the self-incompatibility locus in three sample sets in each of the two closely related plant species Arabidopsis halleri and A. lyrata, and used 100 control regions from throughout the genome to factor out differences in demographic histories and/or sample structure. Nucleotide polymorphism increased strongly around the S-locus in all sample sets, but only over a limited genomic region, as it became indistinguishable from the genomic background beyond the first 25-30kb. Genes in this chromosomal interval exhibited no excess of mutations at 0-fold degenerated sites relative to putatively neutral sites, hence revealing no detectable weakening of the efficacy of purifying selection even for these most tightly linked genes. Overall, our results are consistent with the predictions of a narrow genomic influence of linkage to the S-locus, and clarify how natural selection in one genomic region affects the evolution of the adjacent genomic regions.",

    "abstract": "A pet cockatoo was the suspected source of Cryptococcus neoformans recovered from the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of an immunocompromised patient with cryptococcosis based on the molecular analyses available in 2000. Here we report whole genome sequence analysis of the clinical and cockatoo strains. Both are closely related MAT strains belonging to the VNII lineage, confirming that the human infection likely originated from pet bird exposure. The two strains differ by 61 single nucleotide polymorphisms, including 8 nonsynonymous changes involving 7 genes. To ascertain whether changes in these genes are selected during mammalian infection, we passaged the cockatoo strain in mice. Remarkably, isolates obtained from mouse tissue possess a frame-shift mutation in one of the seven genes altered in the human sample, a gene predicted to encode a SWI-SNF chromatin-remodeling complex protein. Both cockatoo and patient strains as well as mouse passaged isolates obtained from brain tissue had a premature stop codon in a homolog of ZFC3, a predicted single-zinc finger containing protein, which is associated with larger capsules when deleted and appears to have reverted to a full-length protein in the mouse passaged isolates obtained from lung tissue. The patient strain and mouse passaged isolates show variability in the expression of virulence factors, with differences in capsule size, melanization, and rates on non-lytic expulsion from macrophages observed. Our results establish that environmental strains undergo genomic and phenotypic changes during mammalian passage, suggesting that animal virulence can be a mechanism for genetic change and that the genomes of clinical isolates may provide a readout of mutations acquired during infection.",

    "abstract": "Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is an insect pest of major cultivated crops in North and South America. The species has adapted to different host plants and developed resistance to several insecticidal agents, including Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) insecticidal proteins in transgenic cotton and maize. H. zea populations persist year-round in tropical and subtropical regions, but seasonal migrations into temperate zones increase the geographic range of associated crop damage. To better understand the genetic basis of these physiological and ecological characteristics, we generated a high-quality chromosome-level assembly for a single H. zea male from Bt resistant strain, HzStark_Cry1AcR. Hi-C data were used to scaffold an initial 375.2 Mb contig assembly into 30 autosomes and the Z sex chromosome (scaffold N50 = 12.8 Mb and L50 = 14). The scaffolded assembly was error-corrected with a novel pipeline, polishCLR. The mitochondrial genome was assembled through an improved pipeline and annotated. Assessment of this genome assembly indicated 98.8% of the Lepidopteran Benchmark Universal Single-Copy Ortholog set were complete (98.5% as complete single-copy). Repetitive elements comprised approximately 29.5% of the assembly with the plurality (11.2%) classified as retroelements. This chromosome-scale reference assembly for H. zea, ilHelZeax1.1, will facilitate future research to evaluate and enhance sustainable crop production practices.\n\nSignificanceWe established a chromosome-level reference assembly for Helicoverpa zea, an insect pest of multiple cultivated crops in the Americas. This assembly of a Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal protein resistant strain, HzStark_Cry1AcR, will facilitate future research in areas such as population genomics and adaptations to agricultural control practices.",

    "abstract": "Effective phosphoproteome of nanoscale sample analysis remains a daunting task, primarily due to significant sample loss associated with non-specific surface adsorption during enrichment of low stoichiometric phosphopeptide. We developed a novel tandem tip phosphoproteomics sample preparation method that is capable of sample cleanup and enrichment without additional sample transfer, and its integration with our recently developed SOP (Surfactant-assisted One-Pot sample preparation) and iBASIL (improved Boosting to Amplify Signal with Isobaric Labeling) approaches provides a streamlined workflow enabling sensitive, high-throughput nanoscale phosphoproteome measurements. This approach significantly reduces both sample loss and processing time, allowing the identification of >3,000 (>9,500) phosphopeptides from 1 (10) {micro}g of cell lysate using the label-free method without a spectral library. It also enabled precise quantification of [~]600 phosphopeptides from 100 cells sorted by FACS (single-cell level input for the enriched phosphopeptides) and [~]700 phosphopeptides from human spleen tissue voxels with a spatial resolution of 200 {micro}m (equivalent to [~]100 cells) in a high-throughput manner. The new workflow opens avenues for phosphoproteome profiling of mass-limited samples at the low nanogram level.",
