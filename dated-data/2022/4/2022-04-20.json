    "abstract": "Transcription induces a wave of DNA supercoiling, altering the binding affinity of RNA polymerases and reshaping the biochemical landscape of gene regulation. As supercoiling rapidly diffuses, transcription dynamically reshapes the regulation of proximal genes, forming a complex feedback loop. The resulting intergene coupling may provide a mechanism to control transcriptional variance in engineered gene networks and explain the behavior of co-localized native circuits. However, a theoretical framework is needed for integrating both biophysical and biochemical transcriptional regulation to investigate the role of supercoiling-mediated feedback within multi-gene systems. Here, we model transcriptional regulation under the influence of supercoiling-mediated polymerase dynamics, allowing us to identify patterns of expression that result from physical intergene coupling and explore integration of this biophysical model with a set of canonical biochemical gene regulatory systems. We find that gene syntax--the relative ordering and orientation of genes--defines the expression profiles, variance, burst dynamics, and intergene correlation of two-gene systems. By applying our model to both a synthetic toggle switch and the endogenous zebrafish segmentation network, we find that supercoiling can enhance or weaken conventional biochemical regulatory strategies such as mRNA- and protein-mediated feedback loops. Together, our results suggest that supercoiling couples behavior between neighboring genes, representing a novel regulatory mechanism. Integrating biophysical regulation into the analysis and design of gene regulation provides a framework for enhanced understanding of native networks and engineering of synthetic gene circuits.",

    "abstract": "Development of resistance to current antimalarial therapies remains a significant source of concern. To address this risk, new drugs with novel targets in distinct developmental stages of Plasmodium parasites are required. In our current work, we have targeted P. falciparum Tubulin (PfTubulin) proteins which represent some of the potential drug targets for malaria chemotherapy. Plasmodial Microtubules play a crucial role during parasite proliferation, growth, and transmission, which render them highly desirable targets for the development of next-generation chemotherapeutics. Towards this, we have evaluated the antimalarial activity of Tubulin targeting compounds received from the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV) \"Pathogen Box\" against the human malaria parasite, P. falciparum (including 3D7, RKL-9 (Chloroquine resistant) and R539T (Artemisinin resistant) strains). At nanomolar concentrations, filtered out compounds exhibited pronounced multistage antimalarial effects across the parasite life cycle, including intra-erythrocytic blood stages, liver stage parasites, gametocytes and ookinetes. Concomitantly, these compounds were found to impede male gamete ex-flagellation, thus showing transmission-blocking potential of these compounds. Target mining of these potent compounds, by combining in silico, biochemical and biophysical assays, implicated PfTubulin as their molecular target, which may possibly act by disrupting microtubule assembly dynamics by binding at the interface of -{beta}Tubulin-dimer. Further, promising ADME profile of the parent scaffold supported its consideration as a lead compound for further development. Thus, our work highlights the potential of targeting PfTubulin proteins in discovering and developing next-generation, multistage antimalarial agents for treating Multi-Drug Resistant (MDR) malaria parasites.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=151 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/488926v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ae9713org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40950forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1fa34f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa1cae_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExpression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have shown how genetic variants affect downstream gene expression. To identify the upstream regulatory processes, single-cell data can be used. Single-cell data also offers the unique opportunity to reconstruct personalized co-expression networks--by exploiting the large number of cells per individual, we can identify SNPs that alter co-expression patterns (co-expression QTLs, co-eQTLs) using a limited number of individuals.\n\nResultsTo tackle the large multiple testing burden associated with a genome-wide analysis (i.e. the need to assess all combinations of SNPs and gene pairs), we conducted a co-eQTL meta-analysis across four scRNA-seq peripheral blood mononuclear cell datasets from three studies (reflecting 173 unique participants and 1 million cells) using a novel filtering strategy followed by a permutation-based approach. Before analysis, we evaluated the co-expression patterns to be used for co-eQTL identification using different external resources. The subsequent analysis identified a robust set of cell-type-specific co-eQTLs for 72 independent SNPs that affect 946 gene pairs, which we then replicated in a large bulk cohort. These co-eQTLs provide novel insights into how disease-associated variants alter regulatory networks. For instance, one co-eQTL SNP, rs1131017, that is associated with several autoimmune diseases affects the co-expression of RPS26 with other ribosomal genes. Interestingly, specifically in T cells, the SNP additionally affects co-expression of RPS26 and a group of genes associated with T cell-activation and autoimmune disease. Among these genes, we identified enrichment for targets of five T-cell-activation-related transcriptional factors whose binding sites harbor rs1131017. This reveals a previously overlooked process and pinpoints potential regulators that could explain the association of rs1131017 with autoimmune diseases.\n\nConclusionOur co-eQTL results highlight the importance of studying gene regulation at the context-specific level to understand the biological implications of genetic variation. With the expected growth of sc-eQTL datasets, our strategy--combined with our technical guidelines--will soon identify many more co-eQTLs, further helping to elucidate unknown disease mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten human health worldwide, as new variants of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have emerged. Currently, the predominant circulating strains around the world are Omicron variants, which can evade many therapeutic antibodies. Thus, the development of new broadly neutralizing antibodies remains an urgent need. In this work, we address this need by using the mRNA-lipid nanoparticle immunization method to generate a set of Omicron-targeting monoclonal antibodies. Five of our novel K-RBD-mAbs show strong binding and neutralizing activities toward all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron). Notably, the epitopes of these five K-RBD-mAbs are overlapping and localized around K417 and F486 of the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Chimeric derivatives of the five antibodies (K-RBD-chAbs) neutralize Omicron sublineages BA.1 and BA.2 with low IC50 values that range from 5.7 to 12.9 ng/mL. Additionally, we performed antibody humanization on a broadly neutralizing chimeric antibody to create K-RBD-hAb-62, which still retains excellent neutralizing activity against Omicron. Our results collectively suggest that these five therapeutic antibodies may effectively combat current and emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. Therefore, the antibodies can potentially be used as universal neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

We compared monovalent and bivalent mRNA vaccines encoding B.1.351 (Beta) and/or B.1.617.2 (Delta) SARS-CoV-2 S-protein, primarily in a transgenic mouse model and a Wistar rat model. The low-dose bivalent mRNA vaccine contained half the mRNA of each respective monovalent vaccine, but induced comparable neutralizing antibody titres, enrichment of lung-resident memory CD8+ T cells, specific CD4+ and CD8+ responses, and fully protected transgenic mice from SARS-CoV-2 lethality. The bivalent mRNA vaccine significantly reduced viral replication in both Beta- and Delta-challenged mice. Sera from bivalent mRNA vaccine immunized Wistar rats also contained neutralizing antibodies against the B.1.1.529 (Omicron BA.1) variant.

Body weight and virus shedding were monitored daily. 1*10-3 TCID50 was defined as the MID, and this was still sufficient to induce virus shedding at levels up to 102.75 TCID50/ml, equaling the estimated MID for humans.

    "abstract": "Two mutations occurred in SARS-CoV-2 early during the COVID-19 pandemic that have come to define circulating virus lineages1: first a change in the spike protein (D614G) that defines the B.1 lineage and second, a double substitution in the nucleocapsid protein (R203K, G204R) that defines the B.1.1 lineage, which has subsequently given rise to three Variants of Concern: Alpha, Gamma and Omicron. While the latter mutations appear unremarkable at the protein level, there are dramatic implications at the nucleotide level: the GGG[-&gt;]AAC substitution generates a new Transcription Regulatory Sequence (TRS) motif, driving SARS-CoV-2 to express a novel subgenomic mRNA (sgmRNA) encoding a truncated C-terminal portion of nucleocapsid (N.iORF3), which is an inhibitor of type I interferon production. We find that N.iORF3 also emerged independently within the Iota variant, and further show that additional TRS motifs have convergently evolved to express novel sgmRNAs; notably upstream of Spike within the nsp16 coding region of ORF1b, which is expressed during human infection. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is undergoing evolutionary changes at the functional RNA level in addition to the amino acid level, reminiscent of eukaryotic evolution. Greater attention to this aspect in the assessment of emerging strains of SARS-CoV-2 is warranted.",

After a period of evolutionary stasis, a set of SARS-CoV-2 mutations has arisen in the spike, the leading glycoprotein at the viral envelope and the primary antigenic candidate for vaccines against the 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19). Here, we present comparative biochemical data of the glycosylated full-length ancestral and D614G spike together with three other highly transmissible strains classified by the World Health Organization as variants of concern (VOC): beta, gamma, and delta. By showing that only D614G early variant has less hydrophobic surface exposure and trimer persistence at mid-temperatures, we place D614G with features that support a model of temporary fitness advantage for virus spillover worldwide. Further, during the SARS-CoV-2 adaptation, the spike accumulates alterations leading to less structural rigidity. The decreased trimer stability observed for the ancestral and the gamma strain and the presence of D614G uncoupled conformations mean higher ACE-2 affinities when compared to the beta and delta strains.

    "abstract": "The Notch signaling pathway plays a critical role in many developmental and disease related processes. It is widely accepted that Notch has a mechano-transduction module that regulates cleavage of the receptor. However, the role of biomechanical properties of the cellular environment on this module and on Notch signaling in general is still poorly understood. During angiogenesis, differentiation into tip and stalk cells is regulated by Notch. The endothelial cells in this process respond to biochemical and mechanical cues triggered by local stiffening of the ECM. Here, we investigated the influence of substrate stiffness on the Notch signaling pathway in endothelial cells. Using stiffness tuned PDMS substrates we show that Notch signaling pathway activity inversely correlates with the physiologically relevant substrate stiffness, with increased Notch activity on softer substrates. We show that trans-endocytosis of the Notch extracellular domain, but not the overall endocytosis, is regulated by substrate stiffness. Furthermore, we could show that integrin cell-matrix connections are both stiffness-dependent and influenced by Notch. Cadherin mediated cell-cell adhesion and Notch, however, influence each other in that basal Notch signaling is cell-cell contact dependent, but inhibition of the Notch signaling pathway also results in a reduction of VE-cadherin levels. We conclude that mechano-transduction of Notch activation depends on substrate stiffness highlighting the role of substrate rigidity as a modulator of Notch signaling. This may have important implications in pathological situations, such as tumor growth, associated with stiffening of the extracellular matrix.",

Src42A is required for tyrosine phosphorylation at bicellular and tricellular junctions in germband cells and localizes to hotspots of mechanical tension. The role of Src42A was investigated using maternal RNAi and by CRISPR-Cas9-induced germline mosaics. We find that during cell intercalations, Src42A is required for the contraction of junctions at anterior-posterior cell interfaces. The planar polarity of E-cadherin is compromised and E-cadherin accumulates at tricellular junctions after Src42A knock down. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Src42A acts in parallel to Abl, which has also been implicated in cell intercalations. Our data suggest that Src42A is involved in two related processes, one affecting tension generated by the planar polarity of MyoII and secondly, it can act as a signalling factor at tAJs in controlling E-cadherin residence time.",

Recent advances in chromatin conformation capture (Hi-C) have provided a new approach to scaffolding genome assemblies, and the last ten years have seen a proliferation of such methods. However, to our knowledge no comprehensive benchmarking of Hi-C scaffolders has been conducted to date.\n\nResultsThrough a literature review we identified the most popular Hi-C scaffolders - Lachesis, HiRise, 3d-dna, SALSA, and AllHiC. We tested their ability to scaffold four well studied genomes - S. cerevisiae, L. tarentolae, A. thaliana, and H. sapiens. Scaffolders were tasked with both scaffolding fragmented versions of the reference genome as well as de novo assemblies derived from long read datasets. We found that all scaffolders can exceed 80% accuracy under ideal circumstances but that their performance quickly deteriorates under more challenging conditions. Surprisingly, many scaffolders also showed poor performance on the best assemblies, where contigs are near chromosome length. Overall, we found that HiRise and Lachesis offer the best performance on average across all conditions.\n\nConclusionsWe compare the performance of five Hi-C scaffolders using multiple reference species under both ideal and real-life conditions, thereby illuminating their strengths and weaknesses.",

    "abstract": "This is an exciting time for our understanding of the origin of our species. Previous scientific consensus saw human evolution as defined by adaptive differences (behavioural and/or biological) and the emergence of Homo sapiens as the ultimate replacement of non-modern groups by a modern, adaptively more competitive one. However, recent research has shown that the process underlying our origins was considerably more complex. While archaeological and fossil evidence suggests that behavioural complexity may not be confined to the modern human lineage, recent paleogenomic work shows that gene flow between distinct lineages (e.g. Neanderthals, Denisovans, early H. sapiens) occurred repeatedly in the Late Pleistocene, likely contributing elements to our genetic make-up that might have been crucial to our success as a diverse, adaptable species. Following these advances, the prevailing human origins model has shifted from one of near-complete replacement to a more nuanced view of partial replacement with considerable reticulation. Here we provide a brief introduction to the current genetic evidence for hybridization among hominins, its prevalence in, and effects on, comparative mammal groups, and especially how it manifests in the skull. We then explore the degree to which cranial variation seen in the fossil record of Late Pleistocene hominins from Western Eurasia corresponds with our current genetic and comparative data. We are especially interested in understanding the degree to which skeletal data can reflect admixture. Our findings indicate some correspondence between these different lines of evidence, flag individual fossils as possibly admixed, and suggest that different cranial regions may preserve hybridisation signals differentially. We urge further studies of the phenotype in order to expand our ability to detect the ways in which migration, interaction and genetic exchange have shaped the human past, beyond what is currently visible with the lens of ancient DNA.",

    "abstract": "Northern wild rice (NWR; Zizania palustris var. interior) (NWR) is an ecologically important, annual, aquatic species native to North America, that is also cultivated in irrigated paddies in Minnesota and California. NWR seeds are desiccation-sensitive and must be kept in hydrated conditions, in which viability can decline rapidly within the first two years of storage. During this period, microbial growth is rampant and the relationship between these communities and the viability of NWR seed is unclear. In this study, we cultured and identified bacteria and fungi found in 27 NWR seed stocks, collected over a five-year period from three locations and four NWR genotypes. Results revealed that microbial communities were heavily dependent on seed viability and communities began shifting after one year of seed storage. Fungi became more prominent as years in storage increased suggesting that fungi begin to outcompete bacteria. Spatial analysis of locations and genotypes revealed a core set of microbes found across locations and genotypes. Penicillium and Pseudomonas were ubiquitous in NWR hydrated seed storage. We also evaluated the efficacy of four antimicrobial treatments at reducing microbial growth in hydrated NWR seed storage. These treatments did not reduce or drastically change microbial growth or seed viability. However, previously undetected microbes were identified after treatments, which suggested a disruption to the major constituents of the microbiome. Overall, this study identified common microbial constituents found in an aquatic, recalcitrant species, adapted for a cold climate, during seed storage and provides a foundation for future studies to evaluate the effect of microbial communities on NWR seed viability during hydrated storage.",

    "abstract": "The development and connectivity of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), the retinas sole output neurons, are patterned by activity-independent transcriptional programs and activity-dependent remodeling. To inventory the molecular correlates of these influences, we applied high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to mouse RGCs at six embryonic and postnatal ages. We identified temporally regulated modules of genes that correlate with, and likely regulate, multiple phases of RGC development, ranging from differentiation and axon guidance to synaptic recognition and refinement. Some of these genes are expressed broadly while others, including key transcription factors and recognition molecules, are selectively expressed by one or a few of the 45 transcriptomically distinct types defined previously in adult mice. Next, we used these results as a foundation to analyze the transcriptomes of RGCs in mice lacking visual experience due to dark rearing from birth or to mutations that ablate either bipolar or photoreceptor cells. 98.5% of visually deprived (VD) RGCs could be unequivocally assigned to a single RGC type based on their transcriptional profiles, demonstrating that visual activity is dispensable for acquisition and maintenance of RGC type identity. However, visual deprivation significantly reduced the transcriptomic distinctions among RGC types, implying that activity is required for complete RGC maturation or maintenance. Consistent with this notion, transcriptomic alternations in VD RGCs significantly overlapped with gene modules found in developing RGCs. Our results provide a resource for mechanistic analyses of RGC differentiation and maturation, and for investigating the role of activity in these processes.",

    "abstract": "The cholinergic interneurons (ChATs) of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) have a critical role in the activity of this region, specifically in the context of major depressive disorder. To understand the circuitry regulating this behavior we sought to determine the areas that directly project to these cells/interneurons by utilizing the monosynaptic cell-specific tracing technique. Mapping showed monosynaptic projections that are exclusive to NAc ChATs. To determine if some of these projections are altered in a depression mouse model, we used mice that do not express the calcium binding protein p11 specifically in ChATs (ChAT-p11 cKO) and display a depressive-like phenotype. Our data demonstrated that while the overall projection areas remain similar between wild type and in ChAT-p11 cKO mice, the number of projections coming from the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) is significantly reduced in the ChAT-p11 cKO mice. Furthermore, using optogenetics and electrophysiology we showed that glutamatergic projections from vHIP to NAc ChATs are severely altered in mutant mice. These results show that specific alterations in the circuitry of the accumbal ChAT interneurons could play an important role in the regulation of depressive-like behavior, reward seeking behavior in addictions, or psychiatric symptoms in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Previous retrospective investigations in the MS model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), highlighted the important relationship between monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) and the experimented severity of the clinical course. In this work, we show for the first time cells resembling M-MDSCs associated to MS lesions, whose abundance was related to milder MS clinical courses. Moreover, Ly-6Chi cells (which are indistinguishable from circulating M-MDSCs in mice) are useful biomarkers to predict a milder severity of the EAE disease course and a lesser tissue damage extent. Finally, the abundance of M-MDSCs in blood from untreated MS patients at their first relapse was inversely correlated with EDSS at baseline and relapse recovery one-year later. In summary, our data point to M-MDSC load as a promising biomarker of patients clinical course severity.\n\nTeaserThe abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells is related to a milder clinical course in multiple sclerosis patients.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus (IAV) causes a major public health concern, because it is one of the leading causes of respiratory tract infections and hospitalization. Severe influenza has been associated with the cytokine storm, and IAV productive infection cell death in airway epithelial cells may contribute to the exacerbation of this proinflammatory event. On the other hand, IAV replication in macrophages is non-permissive and whether this immune cell may contribute to severe influenza physiopathology requires more details. Here, we investigated IAV-induced macrophage death, along with potential therapeutic intervention. We found that IAV or simply its surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) triggers necroptosis in human and murine macrophages in a Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) and TNF-dependent manner. Anti-TNF treatment, with the clinically approved drug etanercept, prevented the engagement of the necroptotic loop and mice mortality. impaired IAV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine storm and lung injury. Our results implicate macrophage necroptosis with severe influenza in experimental models and potentially repurpose a clinically available therapy.\n\nAuthor SummaryVarious fates of cell death have an integral role in the influenza A virus (IAV) pathogenesis and lung/respiratory dysfunction. IAV physiopathology is not restricted to airway epithelial cells, where this virus actively replicated. Macrophages should support both viral clearance and priming of adaptative immune response in patients that adequately control influenza. However, during severe IAV infection, macrophages - which are unable to support a permissive viral replication - undergo disruptive cell death and contribute to the exacerbated production of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines. We characterized this process by showing that IAV or just its surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) trigger necroptosis, a disruptive and TNF-dependent cells death. Since TNF is a hallmark of pro-inflammatory cell death, we blocked this mediator with a repurposed biomedicine etanercept, which prevented the severe IAV infection in the experimental model. The present work improves the knowledge of influenza pathophysiology by highlighting the importance of macrophage cell death during severe infection.",

Through application of the suite to four genera commonly found in skin microbiomes, we uncover multiple novel findings on the evolution and diversity of their BGCs. We show that the virulence associated carotenoid staphyloxanthin in Staphylococcus aureus is ubiquitous across the Staphylococcus genus but has largely been lost in the skin-commensal species Staphylococcus epidermidis. We further identify thousands of novel single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within BGCs from the Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum sp. complex, which we describe here to be a narrow, multi-species clade that features the most prevalent Corynebacterium in healthy skin microbiomes. Although novel SNVs were approximately ten times as likely to correspond to synonymous changes when located in the top five percentile of conserved sites, lsaBGC identified SNVs which defied this trend and are predicted to underlie amino acid changes within functionally key enzymatic domains. Ultimately, beyond supporting evolutionary investigations, lsaBGC provides important functionalities to aid efforts for the discovery or synthesis of natural products.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial wilt pathogens in the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) have broad but finite host ranges. Population genetic surveys of RSSC pathogens show that many sequevars (subspecies groups) are predominantly recovered from wilting solanaceous plants. In contrast, strains in the IIB-4 sequevar have been isolated from plants in over a dozen families. Certain IIB-4 lineages have been classified as banana-virulent or \"not pathogenic to banana (NPB)\". Prior analysis suggested that the NPB lineage has diverged from the banana-virulent IIB-4 strains. To test this model, we analyzed the phenotypes and phylogeny of a diverse collection of 19 IIB-4 isolates. We used Illumina sequencing to assemble draft genomes of 12 new strains. Based on whole genome phylogenetic analysis, these IIB-4 strains clustered into five subclades. We quantified virulence of each strain on tomato, banana, melon, and impatiens plants. Overall, the virulence patterns correlated with phylogeny. Banana virulence was restricted to the 4/4 IIB-4D subclade (N=4/4 strains) and IIB-4E subclade (N=1/2 strains). Subclades IIB-4D and IIB-4E are sister subclades and their closest relative, the IIB-4A-C subclade, lacked virulence on banana. Our data support a revised model in which banana virulence is an innovation within the IIB4D/E subclades.\n\nData SummaryIllumina sequencing and genome assembly data are available as NCBI BioProject PRJNA826884, and Table S1 lists the accession numbers for assemblies in GenBank and raw sequencing data in SRA.

    "abstract": "Nutrients acquisition by rust fungi during their biotrophic growth has been assigned to a few transporters expressed in haustorial infection structures. We performed a comparative genomic analysis of all transporter genes (hereafter termed transportome) classified according to the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB) focusing specifically on rust fungi (order Pucciniales) versus other species in the Dikarya. We also surveyed expression of transporter genes in the poplar rust fungus for which transcriptomics data are available across the whole life cycle. Despite a significant increase in gene number, rust fungi presented a reduced transportome compared to a vast majority of fungi in the Dikarya. However, a few transporter families in the subclass Porters showed significant expansions. Noteworthy, three metal transport-related families involved in the import, export and sequestration of metals were expanded in Pucciniales and expressed at various stages of the rust life cycle suggesting a tight regulation of metal homeostasis. The most remarkable gene expansion in the Pucciniales was observed for the oligopeptide transporter (OPT) family with 25 genes in average compared to seven to 14 genes in the other surveyed taxonomical ranks. A phylogenetic analysis showed several specific expansion events at the root of the order Pucciniales with subsequent expansions in rust taxonomical families. The OPT genes showed dynamic expression patterns along the rust life cycle and more particularly during infection of the poplar host tree, suggesting a specialization for the acquisition of nitrogen and sulfur through the transport of oligopeptides from the host during biotrophic growth.",

    "abstract": "Infective endocarditis (IE) is one of the most feared and lethal diseases caused by Staphylococcus aureus. Once established, the infection is fast-progressing and tissue destructive. S. aureus of the clonal complex 5 (CC5) commonly cause IE yet are severely understudied. IE results from bacterial colonization and formation of tissue biofilms (known as vegetations) on injured or inflamed cardiac endothelium. S. aureus IE is promoted by adhesins, coagulases, and superantigens, with the exotoxins and exoenzymes likely contributing to tissue destruction and dissemination. Expression of the large repertoire of virulence factors required for IE and sequelae is controlled by complex regulatory networks. We investigated the temporal expression of the global regulators agr (RNAIII), rot, sarS, sarA, sigB, and mgrA in 8 invasive CC5 isolates and established intrinsic expression patterns associated with IE outcomes. We show that vegetation formation, as tested in the rabbit model of IE, inversely correlates with RNAIII and sarA expression during growth in Todd-Hewitt broth (TH). Large vegetations with severe sequelae arise from strains with high-level expression of colonization factors but slower transition towards expression of the exotoxins. Overall, strains proficient in vegetation formation, a hallmark of IE, exhibit lower expression of RNAIII and sarA. Simultaneous high expression of RNAIII, sarA, sigB, and mgrA is the one phenotype assessed in this study that fails to promote IE. Thus, RNAIII and sarA expression that provides for rheostat control of colonization and virulence genes, rather than an on and off switch, promote both vegetation formation and lethal sepsis.",

Extensive proteomics analyses have been performed to identify proteins in SGs; however, the molecular functions of these components in SG formation remain unclear. In this report, we show that ubiquitin-associated protein 2-like (UBAP2L) is a novel component of SGs. UBAP2L localized to SGs in response to various stresses, and its depletion significantly suppressed SG organization. Proteomics and RNA sequencing analyses found that UBAP2L formed a protein-RNA complex with Ras-GTP-activating protein SH3 domain binding protein 1 (G3BP1) and small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). In vitro binding analysis demonstrated that snoRNAs were required for UBAP2L association with G3BP1. In addition, decreased expression of snoRNAs reduced the interaction between UBAP2L and G3BP1 and suppressed SG formation. Our results reveal a critical role of a novel SG component, the UBAP2L/snoRNA/G3BP1 protein-RNA complex, and provide new insights into the regulation of SG assembly.",

This barrier also serves to lubricate during organ movements and to mediate substance exchanges between the environmental milieu and internal organs.

Mucin mis-regulation has been reported in many diseases such as cancers and ones involving the digestive and respiratory tracts. Although the biophysical properties of isolated Mucins have been extensively studied, in vivo models remain scarce for the study of their functions and regulations. Here we characterize the Mucin-like JiangShi (JS) protein and its mutations in the fruit fly Drosophila. JS is an extracellular glycoprotein with domain features reminiscent of mammalian non-membranous Mucins, and one of the most widely distributed Mucin-like proteins studied in Drosophila. Both loss and over-production of JS lead to terminal defects in adult structures and organismal death. Although the physiological function of JS remains poorly defined, we present a genetically tractable model system for the in vivo studies of Mucin-like molecules.",

    "abstract": "The Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea) is one of only two giant tortoise species left in the world. The species is endemic to Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and is considered vulnerable due to its limited distribution and threats posed by climate change. Genomic resources for A. gigantea are lacking, hampering conservation efforts focused on both wild and ex-situ populations. A high-quality genome would also open avenues to investigate the genetic basis of the exceptionally long lifespan. Here, we produced the first chromosome-level de novo genome assembly of A. gigantea using PacBio High-Fidelity sequencing and high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C). We produced a 2.37 Gbp assembly with a scaffold N50 of 148.6 Mbp and a resolution into 26 chromosomes. RNAseq-assisted gene model prediction identified 23,953 protein-coding genes and 1.1 Gbp of repetitive sequences. Synteny analyses among turtle genomes revealed high levels of chromosomal collinearity even among distantly related taxa. We also performed a low-coverage re-sequencing of 30 individuals from wild populations and two zoo individuals. Our genome-wide population structure analyses detected genetic population structure in the wild and identified the most likely origin of the zoo-housed individuals. The high-quality chromosome-level reference genome for A. gigantea is one of the most complete turtle genomes available. It is a powerful tool to assess the population structure in the wild population and reveal the geographic origins of ex-situ individuals relevant for genetic diversity management and rewilding efforts.",

    "abstract": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive human pediatric cancer. Despite robust expression of myogenic regulatory factors, RMS cells are blocked in a proliferative state and do not terminally differentiate. The extent to which the skeletal muscle lineage is represented in RMS tumors and the mechanisms leading to developmental arrest remain elusive. Here, we combined single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq), mass cytometry (CyTOF) and high-content imaging to resolve RMS heterogeneity. ScRNAseq and CyTOF analysis of a total of 17 patient-derived primary cultures and three cell lines uncovered plastic myogenic subpopulations that delineate a branched trajectory. The less aggressive embryonal RMS (eRMS) harbor primarily muscle stem cell (MuSC)-like cells and exhibit sparse commitment to differentiation. The more aggressive alveolar RMS (aRMS) comprise primarily actively cycling committed progenitors with a paucity of differentiated cells. The oncogenic fusion protein PAX3:FOXO1 sustains aRMS cells in the cycling trajectory loop, which we show can re-wired towards differentiation upon its downregulation or by dual pharmacological RAF and MEK inhibition. Our findings provide insights into the developmental states and trajectories underlying RMS progression and identify the RAS pathway as a promising target of differentiation therapy for human aRMS.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCEWe present the first comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic atlas of pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), in which we identify impaired myogenic trajectories with prognostic value. We demonstrate that RAS pathway inhibitors disrupt the oncogenic trajectory and induce terminal differentiation, revealing novel therapeutic targets for the aggressive alveolar RMS subtype.",

    "abstract": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) progresses through two phases: a non-exudative \"dry\" stage that compromises vision but does not involve angiogenesis, and an angiogenic \"wet\" phase characterized by choroidal neovascularization (CNV), in which neovessels from the choroid break through the Bruchs membrane to form neovascular lesions in the macula. If left untreated, CNV leads to permanent central blindness, which the current standard of care (anti-VEGF therapy) arrests but does not reverse. In laser-induced CNV, a laser is used to rupture the Bruchs membrane, prompting the outgrowth of choroidal blood vessels in a wound healing response. This model was used to develop currently available CNV therapeutics, such as intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF and corticosteroid therapies and is considered a gold standard model for CNV. Laser-induced CNV thus remains a highly clinically relevant model of CNV secondary to AMD and other pathologies, such as myopia. A rapidly growing body of research suggests that the pathogenesis of myriad diseases is highly dependent on biological sex, yet most studies use only male animals. This highlights the importance of determining whether the severity and pathogenesis of commonly used models of disease, for example laser-induced CNV, differ between sexes. In the present study, we tracked longitudinal progression and pathogenesis of laser-induced CNV in male and female animals, and found that CNV severity did not differ between sexes. This lack of difference recapitulates findings in human patients with CNV, which have also identified that both sexes are at equal risk of CNV development in the contexts of both age-related macular degeneration induced CNV and myopic CNV.",

    "abstract": "Fat rich diets are believed to induce obesity and contributes to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease while high fructose diet was reported to increase gut surface area and enhance nutrient uptake resulting in weight gain. The study investigate the role of Aloe vera supplementation on lipid profiles, oxidative stress as well as liver and hear histology in high fat and fructose diet fed mice. Twenty mice were distributed into four groups (n=5). The groups received regular diet, high fat and fructose died (HFFD), HFFD plus 10% Aloe vera (HFFD+AV1) and HFFD plus 20% Aloe vera (HFFD+AV2) respectively for 10 weeks. The cholesterol level of HFFD+AV treated mice were significantly lower compared to HFFD treated mice. The ALT level was significantly increased in HFFD treated mice relative to the control. Aloe vera significantly improve albumin level as well as Catalase and superoxide dismutase activities of HFFD treated mice. The liver tissues of control and HFFD+AV2 treated mice showed normal hepatocytes. The study suggest that Aloe vera supplementation could protect against HFFD induced oxidative stress and hyperlipidemia. These findings might be used for further research on food supplementation for the control of metabolic disorders.",

    "abstract": "Synovial fluid is composed of hyaluronan and proteoglycan-4 (PRG4 or lubricin), which work synergistically to maintain joint lubrication. In diseases like osteoarthritis, hyaluronan and PRG4 concentrations can be altered, resulting in lowered synovial fluid viscosity, and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations within the synovial fluid increase. Synovial fibroblasts within the synovium are responsible for contributing to synovial fluid and can be targeted to improve endogenous production of hyaluronan and PRG4 and to alter the cytokine profile. We cyclically loaded SW982 synoviocytes to 0%, 5%, 10%, or 20% strain for three hours at 1 Hz. To assess the impact of substrate stiffness, we compared the 0% strain group to cells grown on tissue culture plastic. We measured the expression of hyaluronan turnover genes, hyaluronan localization within the cell layer, hyaluronan concentration, PRG4 concentration, and the cytokine profile within the media. Our results show that the addition of cyclic loading increased HAS3 expression, but not in a magnitude-dependent response. Hyaluronidase expression was impacted by strain magnitude, which is exemplified by the decrease in hyaluronan concentration due to cyclic loading. We also show that PRG4 concentration is increased at 5% strain, while higher strain magnitude decreases overall PRG4 concentration. Finally, 10% and 20% strain show a distinct, more pro-inflammatory cytokine profile when compared to the unloaded group. Multivariate analysis showed distinct separation between certain strain groups in being able to predict strain group, hyaluronan concentration, and PRG4 concentration from gene expression or cytokine concentration data, highlighting the complexity of the system. Overall, this study shows that cyclic loading can be used tool to modulate the endogenous production of hyaluronan, PRG4, and cytokines from synovial fibroblasts.",
