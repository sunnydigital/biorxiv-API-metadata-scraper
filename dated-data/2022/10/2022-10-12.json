    "abstract": "Regeneration of the Drosophila midgut epithelium depends upon differential expression of transcription factors in intestinal stem cells and their progeny. The grainy head locus produces multiple splice forms that result in production of two classes of transcription factor, designated Grh.O and Grh.N. grainy head expression is associated with epithelial tissue and has roles in epidermal development and regeneration but had not been examined for a function in the midgut epithelium. Null mutant clones had a limited effect on intestinal stem cell (ISC) maintenance and proliferation, but specific loss of the Grh.O isoform results in loss of ISCs from the epithelium. This was confirmed by generation of a new Grh.O mutant to control for genetic background effects. Grh.O mutant ISCs were not lost due to cell death but were forced to differentiate. Ectopic expression of the Grh.N isoform also resulted in ISC differentiation suggesting that the two isoforms act in an opposing manner. Grh.O expression must be tightly regulated as high-level ectopic expression in enteroblasts, but not ISCs, resulted in cells with confused identity and promoted excess proliferation in the epithelium. Thus, midgut regeneration is not only dependent upon signalling pathways that regulate transcription factor expression, but also upon regulated mRNA splicing of these genes.",

    "abstract": "Hemophilia A gene therapy targets hepatocytes to express B domain deleted-(BDD) clotting factor VIII (FVIII) to permit viral encapsidation. Since BDD is prone to misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and ER protein misfolding in hepatocytes followed by high fat diet (HFD) can cause hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we studied how FVIII misfolding impacts HCC development using hepatocyte DNA delivery to express three proteins from the same parental vector: 1) well-folded cytosolic dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR); 2) BDD-FVIII, which is prone to misfolding in the ER; and 3) N6-FVIII which folds more efficiently than BDD-FVIII. One week after DNA delivery, when FVIII expression was undetectable, mice were fed HFD for 65 weeks. Remarkably, all mice that received BDD-FVIII vector developed liver tumors, whereas only 58% of mice that received N6 and no mice that received DHFR vector developed liver tumors, suggesting that the degree of protein misfolding in the ER increases predisposition to HCC in the context of a HFD and in the absence of viral transduction. Our findings raise concerns of ectopic BDD-FVIII expression in hepatocytes in the clinic, which poses risks independent of viral vector integration. Limited expression per hepatocyte and/or use of proteins that avoid misfolding may enhance safety.\n\nGraphical abstract O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Pooled variant expression libraries can test the phenotypes of thousands of variants of a gene in a single multiplexed experiment. In a library encoding all single-amino-acid substitutions of a protein, each variant differs from its reference only at a single codon-position located anywhere along the coding sequence. Consequently, accurately identifying these variants by sequencing is a major technical challenge. A popular but expensive brute-force approach is to divide the pool of variants into multiple smaller sub-libraries that each contains variants of a small region and that must each be constructed and screened individually, but that can then be PCR-amplified and fully sequenced with a single read to allow direct readout of variant abundance. Here we present an approach to screen very large variant libraries with mutations spanning a wide region in a single pool, including library design criteria and mutant-detection algorithms that permit reliable calling and counting of variants from large-scale sequencing data.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe Andes mountains of western South America are a globally important biodiversity hotspot, yet there is a paucity of resolved phylogenies for plant clades from this region. Filling an important gap to our understanding of the Worlds richest flora, we present the first phylogeny of Freziera (Pentaphylacaceae), an Andean-centered, cloud forest radiation. Our dataset was obtained via hybrid-enriched target sequence capture of Angiosperms353 universal loci for 50 of the ca. 75 spp., obtained almost entirely from herbarium specimens. We identify high phylogenomic complexity in Freziera, including a significant proportion of paralogous loci and a high degree of gene tree discordance. Via gene tree filtering, by-eye observation of gene trees, and detailed examination of warnings from recently improved assembly pipelines, we identified that cryptic paralogs (i.e., the presence of only one copy of a multi-copy gene due to assembly errors) were a major source of gene tree heterogeneity that had a negative impact on phylogenetic inference and support. These cryptic paralogs likely result from limitations in data collection that are common in museomics, combined with a history of genome duplication; they may be common in plant phylogenomic datasets. After accounting for cryptic paralogs as source of gene tree error, we identified a significant, but non-specific signal of introgression using Pattersons D and f4 statistics. Despite phylogenomic complexity, we were able to resolve Freziera into nine well-supported subclades whose histories have been shaped by myriad evolutionary processes, including incomplete lineage sorting, historical gene flow, and gene duplication. Our results highlight the complexities of plant phylogenomics, and point to the need to test for multiple sources of gene tree discordance via careful examination of empirical datasets.",

The two assays capture both shared and complementary information for mapping cell state. Cell Painting profiles from compound perturbations are more reproducible and show more diversity, but measure fewer distinct groups of features. Applying unsupervised and supervised methods to predict compound mechanisms of action (MOA) and gene targets, we find that the two assays provide a partially shared, but also a complementary view of drug mechanisms.

    "abstract": "Faster growing cells must synthesize proteins more quickly. Increased ribosome abundance only partly accounts for increases in total protein synthesis rates. The productivity of individual ribosomes must increase too, almost doubling by an unknown mechanism. Prior models point to diffusive transport as a limiting factor but surface a paradox: faster growing cells are more crowded, yet crowding slows diffusion. We suspected physical crowding, transport, and stoichiometry, considered together, might reveal a more nuanced explanation. To investigate, we built a first-principles physics-based model of E. coli cytoplasm in which Brownian motion and diffusion arise directly from physical interactions between individual molecules of finite size, density, and physiological abundance. Using our microscopically-detailed model, we predict that physical transport of individual ternary complexes accounts for ~80% of translation elongation latency. We also find that volumetric crowding increases at faster growth even as cytoplasmic mass density remains relatively constant. Despite slowed diffusion, we predict that improved proximity between ternary complexes and ribosomes wins out, illustrating a simple physics-based mechanism for how individual elongating ribosomes become more productive. We speculate how crowding imposes a physical limit on growth rate and undergirds cellular behavior more broadly. Unfitted colloidal-scale modeling offers systems biology a complementary \"physics engine\" for exploring how cellular-scale behaviors arise from physical transport and reactions among individual molecules.",

    "abstract": "The therapeutic effects of hypnosis in some cases seem to be most marked when the patient has achieved sufficient hypnotic depth. It could be possible to monitor the deepening process using electrophysiological data to obtain information on depth changes throughout the session. However, although hypnosis is characterized by some common EEG patterns, significant differences between subjects are also observed. Therefore, an individualized approach is required to quantify the depth continuously during a session. To achieve this, we proposed the machine learning approach, using an EEG-based Brain-Computer interface, and tested it on video-EEG recordings of 8 outpatients. Based on the data from the first sessions, we trained the classification models to discriminate between conditions of wakefulness and deep hypnosis. Then, we applied them to subsequent sessions to predict the probability of deep hypnosis, i.e., to continuously measure depth level in real time. The models trained using frequency ranges of 1.5-14 and 4-15 Hz provided high accuracy. The applications and perspectives are discussed.",

    "abstract": "To maintain a balance of self-renewal versus neurogenesis, neural stem cells (NSCs) undergo asymmetric cell division along an invariant polarity axis instructed by centrosomes. In the NSCs of the third instar Drosophila larval brain, the interphase centrosomes are defined by marked asymmetries in protein composition and functional activity as microtubule-organizing centers. Here we show that a conserved RNA-binding protein, Orb2, supports NSC centrosome asymmetry by localizing to the cytoplasm, where it promotes robust apical centrosome maturation and transient basal centrosome inactivation, required for centrosome segregation and spindle morphogenesis. Orb2 is required cell autonomously within NSCs to support centrosome asymmetry and maintenance of the stem cell pool. We suggest Orb2 plays opposing roles in centrosome activation and inactivation at the apical versus basal centrosomes respectively, possibly through the translational regulation of multiple mRNAs. Conversely, loss of orb2 manifests in microcephaly independent of Orb2 function in NSCs. Bioinformatics uncovers a significant overlap among RNA targets between Drosophila Orb2 and human CPEB4, consistent with a conserved role for CPEB proteins in centrosome regulation and neurodevelopment.",

A total of 13,443 DL models predicting 4,481 multi-omic biomarkers across 32 cancer types were trained and validated. The investigated biomarkers included a broad range of genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic alterations, as well as established markers relevant for prognosis, molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes. Overall, we found that DL can predict multi-omic biomarkers directly from routine histology images across solid cancer types, with 50% of the models performing at an area under the curve (AUC) of more than 0.633 (with 25% of the models having an AUC larger than 0.711). A wide range of biomarkers were detectable from routine histology images across all investigated cancer types, with a mean AUC of at least 0.62 in almost all malignancies. Strikingly, we observed that biomarker predictability was mostly consistent and not dependent on sample size and class ratio, suggesting a degree of true predictability inherent in histomorphology. Together, the results of our study show the potential of DL to predict a multitude of biomarkers across the omics spectrum using only routine slides.

    "abstract": "Metabolic cost minimization is thought to underscore the neural control of locomotion. Yet, avoiding high muscle activation, a cause of fatigue, often outperforms energy minimization in computational predictions of human gait. Discerning the relative importance of these criteria in human walking has proved elusive, in part, because they have not been empirically decoupled. Here we explicitly decouple whole-body metabolic cost and  fatigue-like muscle activation costs (estimated from electromyography) by pitting them against one another using two distinct gait tasks. When experiencing these competing costs, participants (N=10) chose the task that avoided overburdening muscles (fatigue avoidance) at the expense of higher metabolic power (p<0.05). Muscle volume-normalized activation more closely models energy use and was also minimized by the participants decision (p<0.05), demonstrating that muscle activation was, at best, an inaccurate signal for metabolic energy. Energy minimization was only observed when there was no adverse effect on muscle activation costs. By decoupling whole-body metabolic and muscle activation costs, we provide among the first empirical evidence of humans embracing non-energetic optimality in favor of a clearly defined neuromuscular objective. This finding indicates that local muscle fatigue and effort may well be key factors dictating human walking behavior and its evolution.",

The MT destabilizing Kinesin-8, Kif18B, controls astral MT dynamics and spindle positioning. Kif18B interacts with importin /{beta} as well as with the plus-tip tracking protein EB1, but how these associations modulate Kif18B is not known. We mapped the key binding sites on Kif18B, made residue-specific mutations, and assessed their impact on Kif18B function. Blocking EB1 interaction disrupted Kif18B MT plus-end accumulation and inhibited its ability to control MT length on monopolar spindles in cells. Blocking importin /{beta} interaction disrupted Kif18B localization without affecting aster size. In vitro, importin /{beta} increased Kif18B MT association by increasing the on-rate and decreasing the off-rate from MTs, which stimulated MT destabilization. In contrast, EB1 promoted MT destabilization without increasing lattice binding in vitro, which suggests that EB1 and importin /{beta} have distinct roles in the regulation of Kif18B-mediated MT destabilization. We propose that importin /{beta}-spatially modulate Kif18B association with MTs to facilitate its MT destabilization activity. Our results suggest that Ran-regulation is important not only to control molecular motor function near chromatin but also provides a spatial control mechanism to modulate MT binding of NLS-containing spindle assembly factors.",

    "abstract": "SignificanceFunctional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a promising tool for neurofeedback (NFB) or brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). However, fNIRS signals are typically highly contaminated by systemic activity (SA) artifacts, and, if not properly corrected, NFB or BCIs run the risk of being based on noise instead of brain activity. This risk can likely be reduced by correcting for SA, in particular when short-distance channels (SDCs) are available. Literature comparing correction methods with and without SDCs is still sparse, specifically comparisons considering single trials are lacking.\n\nAimThis study aimed at comparing the performance of SA correction methods with and without SDCs.\n\nApproachSemisimulated and real motor task data of healthy older adults were used. Correction methods without SDCs included a simple and a more advanced spatial filter. Correction methods with SDCs included a regression approach considering only the closest SDC and two GLM-based methods, one including all eight SDCs and one using only two a priori selected SDCs as regressors. All methods were compared with data uncorrected for SA and correction performance was assessed with quality measures quantifying signal improvement and spatial specificity at single trial level.\n\nResultsAll correction methods were found to improve signal quality and enhance spatial specificity as compared with the uncorrected data. Methods with SDCs usually outperformed methods without SDCs. Correction methods without SDCs tended to overcorrect the data. However, the exact pattern of results and the degree of differences observable between correction methods varied between semisimulated and real data, and also between quality measures.\n\nConclusionsOverall, results confirmed that both {Delta}[HbO] and {Delta}[HbR] are affected by SA and that correction methods with SDCs outperform methods without SDCs. Nonetheless, improvements in signal quality can also be achieved without SDCs and should therefore be given priority over not correcting for SA.",

    "abstract": "The lifespans of proteins can range from minutes to years within mammalian tissues. Protein lifespan is relevant to organismal aging, as long-lived proteins can accrue damage over time. It is unclear how protein lifetime is shaped by tissue context, where both cell division and proteolytic degradation contribute to protein turnover. Here, we develop turnover and replication analysis by 15N isotope labeling (TRAIL) to quantify both protein and cell lifetimes with high precision and no toxicity over a 32-day labeling period across 4 mammalian tissues. We report that cell division promotes non-selective protein turnover in proliferative tissues, while physicochemical features such as hydrophobicity, charge, and intrinsic disorder exert a significant influence on protein turnover only in non-proliferative tissues. Protein lifetimes vary non-randomly across tissues after correcting for differences in cell division rate. Multiprotein complexes such as the ribosome have highly consistent lifetimes across tissues, while mitochondria, peroxisomes, and lipid droplets have variable lifetimes. These data indicate that cell turnover, sequence-encoded features, and other environmental factors modulate protein lifespan in vivo. In the future, TRAIL can be used to explore how environment, aging, and disease affect tissue homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "PACS1 syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by intellectual disability and craniofacial abnormalities resulting from a de novo p.R203W variant in phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 (PACS1). PACS1 plays roles in the endosomal pathway and nucleus, but little is known about how this variant affects developing neurons and patients have few therapeutic options. Here, we used stem cellderived models to show that PACS1(+/R203W) neurons have impaired expression of genes enriched for synaptic signaling processes. We assessed the functional impact of this differential expression and find that PACS1(+/R203W) neurons have a striking prolongation of network burst duration resulting from an increased inter-spike interval. These results suggest that an aberrant regulation of ionic flux affecting spike frequency underlies the neurological phenotypes experienced by patients. This work is the first to investigate the impact of the PACS1 p.R203W variant on developing neural tissue, revealing electrophysiological mechanisms of disease and putative targets for pharmacological intervention.",

    "abstract": "For both humans and machines, the essence of learning is to pinpoint which components in its information processing pipeline are responsible for an error in its output -- a challenge that is known as credit assignment. How the brain solves credit assignment is a key question in neuroscience, and also of significant importance for artificial intelligence. It has long been assumed that credit assignment is best solved by backpropagation, which is also the foundation of modern machine learning. However, it has been questioned whether it is possible for the brain to implement backpropagation and learning in the brain may actually be more efficient and effective than backpropagation. Here, we set out a fundamentally different principle on credit assignment, called prospective configuration. In prospective configuration, the network first infers the pattern of neural activity that should result from learning, and then the synaptic weights are modified to consolidate the change in neural activity. We demonstrate that this distinct mechanism, in contrast to backpropagation, (1) underlies learning in a well-established family of models of cortical circuits, (2) enables learning that is more efficient and effective in many contexts faced by biological organisms, and (3) reproduces surprising patterns of neural activity and behaviour observed in diverse human and animal learning experiments. Our findings establish a new foundation for learning beyond backpropagation, for both understanding biological learning and building artificial intelligence.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, several coral genomes have been sequenced allowing a better understanding of these symbiotic organisms threatened by climate change. Scleractinian corals are reef builders and are central to these ecosystems, providing habitat and food to a great diversity of species. In the frame of the Tara Pacific expedition, we generated two coral genomes, Porites lobata and Pocillopora meandrina with vastly improved contiguity that allowed us to study the functional organisation of these genomes. We annotated their gene catalog and report a relatively higher gene number (43,000 and 32,000 genes respectively) than that found in other public coral genome sequences. This finding is explained by a high number of tandemly duplicated genes (almost a third of the predicted genes). We show that these duplicated genes originate from multiple and distinct duplication events throughout the coral lineage. They contribute to the amplification of gene families, mostly related to immune system and disease-resistance, which we suggest to be functionally linked to coral host resilience. At large, we show the importance of duplicated genes to inform the biology of reef-building corals and provide novel avenues to understand and screen for differences in stress resilience.",

    "abstract": "Visual information arriving at the retina is transmitted to the brain by signals in the optic nerve, and the brain must rely solely on these signals to make inferences about the visual world. Previous work has probed the content of these signals by directly reconstructing images from retinal activity using linear regression or nonlinear regression with neural networks. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) reconstruction using retinal encoding models and separately-trained natural image priors offers a more general and principled approach. We develop a novel method for approximate MAP reconstruction that combines a generalized linear model for retinal responses to light, including their dependence on spike history and spikes of neighboring cells, with the image prior implicitly embedded in a deep convolutional neural network trained for image denoising. We use this method to reconstruct natural images from ex vivo simultaneously-recorded spikes of hundreds of retinal ganglion cells uniformly sampling a region of the retina. The method produces reconstructions that match or exceed the state-of-the-art in perceptual similarity and exhibit additional fine detail, while using substantially fewer model parameters than previous approaches. The use of more rudimentary encoding models (a linear-nonlinear-Poisson cascade) or image priors (a 1/f spectral model) significantly reduces reconstruction performance, indicating the essential role of both components in achieving high-quality reconstructed images from the retinal signal.",

Because single-agent therapy may fail to deliver durable clinical response, targeting of P-TEFb shall benefit when deployed as a combination therapy. We screened a comprehensive oncology library and identified clinically relevant antimetabolites and Mouse double minute 2 homolog (MDM2) inhibitors as top compounds eliciting p53-dependent death of colorectal cancer cells in synergy with selective inhibitors of P-TEFb. While the targeting of P-TEFb augments apoptosis by antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil, it switches the fate of cancer cells by the non-genotoxic MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3a from cell-cycle arrest to apoptosis. Mechanistically, the fate switching is enabled by the induction of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic genes and repression of P-TEFb-dependent pro-survival genes of the PI3K-AKT signaling cascade, which stimulates Caspase 9 and intrinsic apoptosis pathway in BAX/BAK-dependent manner. Finally, combination treatments trigger apoptosis of cancer cell spheroids. Together, co-targeting of P-TEFb and suppressors of intrinsic apoptosis could become a viable strategy to eliminate cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundInference of complex demographic histories is a source of information about events that happened in the past of studied populations. Existing methods for demographic inference typically require input from the researcher in the form of a parameterized model. With an increased variety of methods and tools, each with its own interface, the model specification becomes tedious and error-prone. Moreover, optimization algorithms used to find model parameters sometimes turn out to be inefficient, for instance, by being not properly tuned or highly dependent on a user-provided initialization. The open-source software GADMA addresses these problems, providing automatic demographic inference. It proposes a common interface for several likelihood engines and provides global parameters optimization based on a genetic algorithm.\n\nResultsHere, we introduce the new GADMA2 software and provide a detailed description of the added and expanded features. It has a renovated core code base, new likelihood engines, an updated optimization algorithm and a flexible setup for automatic model construction. We provide a full overview of GADMA2 enhancements, compare the performance of supported likelihood engines on simulated data and demonstrate an example of GADMA2 usage on two empirical datasets.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate the better performance of a genetic algorithm in GADMA2 by comparing it to the initial version and other existing optimization approaches. Our experiments on simulated data indicate that GADMA2s likelihood engines are able to provide accurate estimations of demographic parameters even for misspecified models.

Previous research has focused on visual change due to stimulus motion, eye movements or unfolding events, but not their combined impact across the brain, or their interactions with semantic novelty. We investigate the neural responses to these sources of novelty during film viewing. We analyzed intracranial recordings in humans across 6328 electrodes from 23 individuals. Responses associated with saccades and film cuts were dominant across the entire brain. Film cuts at semantic event boundaries were particularly effective in the temporal and medial temporal lobe. Saccades to visual targets with high visual novelty were also associated with strong neural responses. Specific locations in higher-order association areas showed selectivity to either high or low-novelty saccades. We conclude that neural activity associated with film cuts and eye movements is widespread across the brain and is modulated by semantic novelty.",

    "abstract": "Population bottlenecks are commonplace in experimental evolution, specifically in serial passaging experiments where microbial populations alternate between growth and dilution. Natural populations also experience such fluctuations caused by seasonality, resource limitation, or host-to-host transmission for pathogens. Yet, how unlimited growth with periodic bottlenecks influence the adaptation of populations is not fully understood. Here we study theoretically the effects of bottlenecks on the accessibility of evolutionary paths and on the rate of evolution. We model an asexual population evolving on a minimal fitness landscape consisting of two types of beneficial mutations with the empirically supported trade-off between mutation rate and fitness advantage, in the regime where multiple beneficial mutations may segregate simultaneously. In the limit of large population sizes and small mutation rates, we show the existence of a unique most likely evolutionary scenario, determined by the size of the wild-type population at the beginning and at the end of each cycle. These two key demographic parameters determine which adaptive paths may be taken by the evolving population by controlling the supply of mutants during growth and the loss of mutants at the bottleneck. We do not only show that bottlenecks act as a deterministic control of evolutionary paths but also that each possible evolutionary scenario can be forced to occur by tuning demographic parameters. This work unveils the effects of demography on adaptation of periodically bottlenecked populations and can guide the design of evolution experiments.",

This study describes a new pipeline to train a convolutional neural network for rapid and efficient detection of structures of wide range in size and complexity.\n\nAbstractThree-dimensional electron microscopy is an important imaging modality in contemporary cell biology. Identification of intracellular structures is laborious and time-consuming, however, and impairs effective use of a potentially powerful tool. Resolving this bottleneck is therefore a critical next step in frontier biomedical imaging. We describe Automated Segmentation of intracellular substructures in Electron Microscopy (ASEM), a new pipeline to train a convolutional neural network to detect structures of wide range in size and complexity. We obtain for each structure a dedicated model based on a small number of sparsely annotated ground truth annotations from only one or two cells. To improve model generalization to different imaging conditions, we developed a rapid, computationally effective strategy to refine an already trained model by including a few additional annotations. We show the successful automated identification of mitochondria, Golgi apparatus, endoplasmic reticulum, nuclear pore complexes, caveolae, clathrin coated pits and coated vesicles in cells imaged by focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy with quasi-isotropic resolution. ASEM enabled us to uncover a wide range of membrane-nuclear pore diameters within a single cell and to derive morphological metrics from clathrin coated pits and vesicles at all stages of maturation consistent with the classical constant-growth assembly model.",

    "abstract": "Genomic data provide valuable insights into pest management issues such as resistance evolution, historical patterns of pest invasions and ongoing population dynamics. We assembled the first reference genome for the redlegged earth mite, Halotydeus destructor (Tucker, 1925), to investigate adaptation to pesticide pressures and demography in its invasive Australian range using whole-genome pool-seq data from regionally distributed populations. Our reference genome comprises 132 autosomal contigs, with a total length of 48.90 Mb. We observed a large complex of ace genes, which has presumably evolved from a long history of organophosphate selection in H. destructor and may contribute toward organophosphate resistance through copy number variation, target-site mutations, and structural variants. In the putative ancestral H. destructor ace gene, we identified three target-site mutations (G119S, A201S, and F331Y) segregating in organophosphate resistant populations. Additionally, we identified two new para sodium channel gene mutations (L925I and F1020Y) that may contribute to pyrethroid resistance. Regional structuring observed in population genomic analyses indicates that gene flow in H. destructor does not homogenise populations across large geographic distances. However, our demographic analyses were equivocal on the magnitude of gene flow; the short invasion history of H. destructor makes it difficult to distinguish scenarios of complete isolation vs. ongoing migration. Nonetheless, we identified clear signatures of reduced genetic diversity and smaller inferred effective population sizes in eastern vs. western populations, which is consistent with the stepping-stone invasion pathway of this pest in Australia. These new insights will inform development of diagnostic genetic markers of resistance, further investigation into the multifaceted organophosphate resistance mechanism, and predictive modelling of resistance evolution and spread.",

    "abstract": "Deep neural networks show great promise for classifying brain diseases and making prognostic assessments based on neuroimaging data, but large, labeled training datasets are often required to achieve high predictive accuracy. Here we evaluated a range of transfer learning or pre-training strategies to create useful MRI representations for downstream tasks that lack large amounts of training data, such as Alzheimers disease (AD) classification. To test our proposed pre-training strategies, we analyzed 4,098 3D T1-weighted brain MRI scans from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort and independently validated with an out-of-distribution test set of 600 scans from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS3) cohort for detecting AD. First, we trained 3D and 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. We tested combinations of multiple pre-training strategies based on (1) supervised, (2) contrastive learning, and (3) self-supervised learning - using pre-training data within versus outside the MRI domain. In our experiments, the 3D CNN pre-trained with contrastive learning provided the best overall results - when fine-tuned on T1-weighted scans for AD classification - outperformed the baseline by 2.8% when trained with all of the training data from ADNI. We also show test performance as a function of the training dataset size and the chosen pre-training method. Transfer learning offered significant benefits in low data regimes, with a performance boost of 7.7%. When the pre-trained model was used for AD classification, we were able to visualize an improved clustering of test subjects diagnostic groups, as illustrated via a uniform manifold approximation (UMAP) projection of the high-dimensional model embedding space. Further, saliency maps indicate the additional activation regions in the brain scan using pre-training, that then maximally contributed towards the final prediction score.",

    "abstract": "Cell motility on flat substrates exhibits multistability between steady and oscillatory morphodynamics, spread and moving states, the biphasic adhesion-velocity relation, and the universal correlation between speed and persistence (UCSP) as simultaneously observed phenomena. Their universality and concurrency suggest a unifying mechanism to exist causing all of them. We search for that mechanism by investigating trajectories of MDA-MB-231 cells on Fibronectin lanes. We also find multistability caused by the clutch mechanism of retrograde flow. Control of the clutch parameters by integrin signalling causes the biphasic adhesion-velocity relation. Protrusion competition based on the clutch causes direction reversal events, the statistics of which explains the UCSP. We suggest that F-actin polymerisation, clutch mechanism of retrograde flow, protrusion competition via membrane tension and drag forces cause the multistability and dynamic cell states, state transition statistics causes the UCSP and the control of this dynamic system by integrin signalling entails the adhesion-velocity relation.",

    "abstract": "Pupils can signify various internal processes and states, such as attention, arousal, and working memory. Changes in pupil size have been associated with learning speed, prediction of future events, and deviations from the prediction in human studies. However, the detailed relationships between pupil size changes and prediction are unclear. We explored pupil size dynamics in mice performing a Pavlovian delay conditioning task. A head-fixed experimental setup combined with deep-learning-based image analysis enabled us to reduce spontaneous locomotor activity and to track the precise dynamics of pupil size of behaving mice. By setting up two experimental groups, one for which mice were able to predict reward in the Pavlovian delay conditioning task and the other for which mice were not, we demonstrated that the pupil size of mice is modulated by reward prediction and consumption, as well as body movements, but not by unpredicted reward delivery. Furthermore, we clarified that pupil size is still modulated by reward prediction even after the disruption of body movements by intraperitoneal injection of haloperidol, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that changes in pupil size reflect reward prediction signals. Thus, we provide important evidence to reconsider the neuronal circuit involved in computing reward prediction error. This integrative approach of behavioral analysis, image analysis, pupillometry, and pharmacological manipulation will pave the way for understanding the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of reward prediction and the prediction errors essential to learning and behavior.\n\nManuscript contributions to the fieldPredicting upcoming events is essential for the survival of many animals, including humans. Accumulating evidence suggests that pupillary responses reflect autonomic activity and are modulated by noradrenergic, cholinergic, and serotonergic neurotransmission. However, the relationships between pupillary responses, reward prediction, and reward prediction errors remain unclear. This study examined changes in pupil size while water-deprived mice performed a Pavlovian delay conditioning task using a head-fixed setup. The head-fixed experimental setup, combined with deep-learning-based image analysis, enabled us to reduce spontaneous locomotor activity and to track the precise dynamics of the licking response and the pupil size of behaving mice. A well-controlled, rigid behavioral experimental design allowed us to investigate the modulation of behavioral states induced by reward prediction. While pharmacological manipulation might affect pupil size, the combined approach of pupillometry and pharmacological manipulation allowed us to differentiate reward prediction signals and signals modulated by body movements. We revealed that the changes in pupil size (1) reflect reward prediction signals and (2) do not reflect signals of reward prediction error. These results provide novel insights into the neuronal circuitry potentially involved in computing reward prediction errors. The integrative approach of behavioral analysis, image analysis, pupillometry, and pharmacological manipulation used in this study will pave the way for understanding the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms of prediction and the prediction errors essential in learning and behavior.",

    "abstract": "Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes are molecular machines driving chromatin organization at higher levels. In eukaryotes, three SMC complexes (cohesin, condensin, and SMC5/6) play key roles in cohesion, condensation, replication, transcription and DNA repair. Here, we performed a genetic screen in fission yeast to identify novel factors required for SMC5/6 binding to DNA. We identified 79 genes of which histone acetyltransferases (HATs) were the most represented. Genetic and phenotypic analyses suggested a particularly strong functional relationship between the SMC5/6 and SAGA complexes. Furthermore, several SMC5/6 subunits physically interacted with SAGA HAT module components Gcn5 and Ada2. As Gcn5-dependent acetylation facilitates the accessibility of chromatin to DNA repair proteins, we first analysed the formation of DNA damage-induced SMC5/6 foci in the {Delta}gcn5 mutant. The SMC5/6 foci formed normally in {Delta}gcn5, suggesting SAGA-independent SMC5/6 localization to DNA-damaged sites. Next, we used Nse4-FLAG chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) analysis in unchallenged cells to assess SMC5/6 distribution. A significant portion of SMC5/6 accumulated within gene regions in wild-type cells, which was reduced in {Delta}gcn5 and {Delta}ada2 mutants. The drop in SMC5/6 levels was also observed in gcn5-E191Q acetyltransferase-dead mutant. Altogether, our data suggest that the SAGA HAT module may facilitate chromatin accessibility to SMC5/6 at gene regions.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenomes of all eukaryotes must be folded and packed into their relatively small nuclear spaces. Histones first pack free genomic DNA into nucleosomes and their arrays. Other complexes like histone modifiers and remodelers can regulate nucleosome positions and their packing within chromatin fibres. They assist in the relative opening or condensation of chromatin fibres and facilitate their accessibility to DNA-binding proteins. The highly conserved Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) complexes (cohesin, condensin, and SMC5/6) compact further chromatin fibres at higher levels. These molecular machines can loop chromatin fibres, which need access to segments of free DNA for their physical binding to DNA. Here, we studied genetic and physical interactions between histone-modifying SAGA complex and SMC5/6. We show that the SAGA histone acetyltransferase module may facilitate chromatin access to SMC5/6.",

    "abstract": "The control of cellular zinc (Zn) concentrations by dedicated import and export systems is essential for the survival and virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The transcription of its many Zn transporters is therefore tightly regulated by a known set of transcription factors involved in either the import or the export of Zn. In this work, we show that the Zur protein, a well-known repressor of Zn import, plays a dual role and functions in both import and export processes. In a situation of Zn excess, Zur represses Zn entry, but also activates the transcription of czcR, a positive regulator of the Zn export system. To achieve this, Zur binds at two sites, located by DNA footprinting in the region downstream the czcR transcription start site. In agreement with this regulation, a delay in induction of the efflux system is observed in the absence of Zur and Zn resistance is affected. The discovery of this regulation highlights a new role of Zur as global regulator of Zn homeostasis in P. aeruginosa disclosing an important link between Zur and zinc export.",

    "abstract": "Recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoter regions is essential for transcription. Despite conflicting evidence, the Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC) is often thought to be of uniform composition and assemble at all promoters via an identical mechanism. Here, we show using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a model that promoter classes with distinct functions and initiation patterns function via PICs that display different compositions and dependencies: developmental promoter DNA readily associates with the canonical Pol II PIC, whereas housekeeping promoter DNA does not and instead recruit different factors such as DREF. Consistently, TBP and DREF are required by distinct sets of promoters, and TBP and its paralog TRF2 function at different promoter types, partly exclusively and partly redundantly. In contrast, TFIIA is required for transcription from all promoters, and we identify factors that can recruit and/or stabilize TFIIA at housekeeping promoters and activate transcription. We show that promoter activation by these factors is sufficient to induce the dispersed transcription initiation patterns characteristic of housekeeping promoters. Thus, different promoter classes direct distinct mechanisms of transcription initiation, which relate to different focused versus dispersed initiation patterns.",

    "abstract": "O_LIRecolonization of predators to their former ranges is becoming increasingly prevalent. Such recolonization places predators amongst their prey once again; the latter having lived without predation (from such predators) for considerable time. This renewed coexistence creates opportunities to explore predation ecology at both fundamental and applied levels.\nC_LIO_LIWe used a paired experimental design to investigate white-tailed deer risk allocation in the Upper and Lower Peninsulas (UP and LP) in Michigan, USA. Wolves are functionally absent in the LP, while deer in the UP coexist with a re-established wolf population. We treated 15 sites each in UP and LP with wolf olfactory cues, and observed deer vigilance, activity, and visitation rates at the interface of habitat covariates using remote cameras. Such a paired design across wolf versus no-wolf areas allowed us to examine indirect predation effects while accounting for confounding parameters such as the presence of other predators and human activity.\nC_LIO_LIWhile wolf urine had no effect across most metrics in both UP and LP, we observed differences in deer activity in areas with versus without wolves. Sites treated with wolf urine in the UP showed a reduction in crepuscular deer activity, compared to control/novel-scent treated sites. Further, we observed a strong positive effect of vegetation cover on deer vigilance in these sites. This indicates that simulated predator cues likely affect deer vigilance more acutely in denser habitats, which presumably facilitates predation success. Such responses were however absent among deer in the LP that are presumably naive towards wolf predation.\nC_LIO_LIWhere human and non-human predators hunt shared prey, such as in Michigan, predators may constrain human hunting success by increasing deer vigilance. Hunters may avoid such exploitative competition by choosing hunting/bait sites located in open areas. Our results pertaining to fundamental predation ecology have strong applied implications that can promote human-predator coexistence.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Characterization of inter-regional interactions in brain is essential for understanding the mechanism relevant to normal brain function and neurological disease. The recently developed flexible micro ()-electrocorticography (ECoG) device is one prominent method used to examine large-scale cortical activity across multiple regions. The sheet-shaped ECoG electrodes arrays can be placed on a relatively wide area of cortical surface beneath the skull by inserting the device into the space between skull and brain. Although rats and mice are useful tools for neuroscience, current ECoG recording methods in these animals are limited to the parietal region of cerebral cortex. Recording cortical activity from the temporal region of cortex in mice has proven difficult because of surgical barriers created by the skull and surrounding temporalis muscle anatomy. Here, we developed a sheet-shaped 64-channel ECoG device that allows access to the mouse temporal cortex, and we determined the factor determining the appropriate bending stiffness for the ECoG electrode array. We also established a surgical technique to implant the electrode arrays into the epidural space over a wide area of cerebral cortex covering from the barrel field to olfactory (piriform) cortex, which is the deepest region of the cerebral cortex. Using histology and computed tomography (CT) images, we confirmed that the tip of the ECoG device reached to the most ventral part of cerebral cortex without causing noticeable damage to the brain surface. Moreover, the device simultaneously recorded somatosensory and odor stimulus-evoked neural activity from dorsal and ventral parts of cerebral cortex in awake and anesthetized mice. These data indicate that our ECoG device and surgical techniques enable the recording of large-scale cortical activity from the parietal to temporal cortex in mice, including somatosensory and olfactory cortices. This system will provide more opportunities for the investigation of physiological functions from wider areas of the mouse cerebral cortex than those currently available with existing ECoG techniques.",

Yet its underlying metabolic mechanisms and neurobehavioral relevance remain largely unclear. Here, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients, as well as neural specificity, which is shaped by GABA and glutamate signals and underlies efficient sensory and cognitive functions. Our study showed that among the older adults, both GABA and glutamate levels decrease with increasing glaucoma severity regardless of age. Further, the reduction of GABA but not glutamate predicted the neural specificity. This association was independent of the impairments on the retina structure and age. Our results suggest that glaucoma-specific decline of GABA undermines neural specificity in the visual cortex and that targeting GABA could improve the neural specificity in glaucoma.",

Accumulating evidence suggests that small GTPases, RalA and RalB, and their activators, Ral guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RalGEFs), play an essential role in oncogenic Ras-induced signalling. We studied the interaction between human KRas4B and the Ras association (RA) domain of Rgl2 (Rgl2RA), one of the RA-containing RalGEFs.

    "abstract": "While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact public health worldwide significantly, the use of antiviral drugs and therapies has dramatically reduced the instances of severe disease and death. More broadly, the unprecedented use of antivirals also provides hope for preventing and mitigating similar viral outbreaks in the future. Here we ask: What are the comparative impact of antiviral therapeutics targeting different stages of the viral lifecycle? How do antiviral therapeutics impact the viral population in the bloodstream, or in other words, the viral load in high and low-immunity individuals? To address these questions, we use a model of viral quasispecies dynamics to examine the efficacy of antiviral strategies targeting three critical aspects of the viral life cycle, fecundity, reproduction rate, or infection rate. We find a linear relationship of the viral load with the change in fecundity and a power law with the change in the reproduction rate of the virus, with the viral load decreasing as the fecundity and the reproduction rates are decreased. Interestingly, however, for antivirals that target the infection rate, the viral load changes non-monotonically with the change in infection rate; the viral population initially increases and then decreases as the infection rate is decreased. The initial increase is especially pronounced for individuals with low immunity. By examining the viral population inside cells for such cases, we found that the therapeutics are only effective in such individuals if they stop the infection process entirely. Otherwise, the viral population inside cells does not go extinct. Our results predict the effectiveness of different antiviral strategies for COVID-19 and similar viral diseases and provide insights into the susceptibility of individuals with low immunity to effects like long covid.",

How translation factors detect heat and assemble into condensates is not well understood. Here, we investigate heat-induced condensate assembly by the translation factor Ded1p from five different fungi, including Ded1p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Using targeted mutagenesis and in vitro reconstitution biochemistry, we find that heat-induced Ded1p assembly is driven by a conformational rearrangement of the folded helicase domain. This rearrangement determines the assembly temperature and the assembly of Ded1p into nanometer-sized particles, while the flanking intrinsically disordered regions engage in intermolecular interactions to promote assembly into micron-sized condensates. Using protein engineering, we identify six amino acid substitutions that determine most of the thermostability of a thermophilic Ded1p ortholog, thereby providing a molecular understanding underlying the adaptation of the Ded1p assembly temperature to the specific growth temperature of the species. We conclude that heat-induced assembly of Ded1p into translation factor condensates is regulated by a complex interplay of the structured domain and intrinsically disordered regions which is subject to evolutionary tuning.",

    "abstract": "Studying electrophile signaling is marred by difficulties in parsing changes in pathway flux attributable to on-target, vis-a-vis off-target, modifications. By combining bolus dosing, knockdown, and Z-REX--a tool investigating on-target/on-pathway electrophile signaling, we document that electrophile labeling of one zebrafish-Keap1-paralog (zKeap1b) stimulates Nrf2-driven antioxidant response (AR) signaling (like the human-ortholog). Conversely, zKeap1a is a dominant-negative regulator of electrophile-promoted Nrf2-signaling, and itself is nonpermissive for electrophile-induced Nrf2-upregulation. This behavior is recapitulated in human cells, wherein following electrophile treatment: (1) zKeap1b-transfected cells are permissive for augmented AR-signaling through reduced zKeap1b-Nrf2 binding; (2) zKeap1a-transfected cells are non-permissive for AR-upregulation, as zKeap1a-Nrf2 binding capacity remains unaltered; (3) 1:1 ZKeap1a:zKeap1b-transfected cells show no Nrf2-release from the Keap1-complex, rendering these cells unable to upregulate AR. We identified a zKeap1a-specific point-mutation (C273I) responsible for zKeap1as behavior. Human-Keap1(C273I), of known diminished Nrf2-regulatory capacity, dominantly muted electrophile-induced Nrf2-signaling. These studies highlight divergent and interdependent electrophile signaling behaviors, despite conserved electrophile sensing.\n\nImpact statementHow electrophile-sensing versus -signaling marshal stress responses: two zebrafish Keap1-paralogs are equally adept at electrophile-sensing but manifest divergent and co-regulatory electrophile-signaling behaviors.",

So, mechanistic basis of four Echinacea species (i.e. Echinacea purpurea, Echinacea angustifolia, Echinacea pallida, and Echinacea sanguinea) to salinity stress tolerance, and K+ retention were assessed in the present study. Non-invasive microelectrode ion flux measuring, DHAR and MDHAR activities, and pharmacological measurements were performed based on the standard methods. Ion flux measurements revealed higher K+ efflux in E. pallida and E. sanguinea species compared to the E. purpurea and E. angustifolia species in the elongation zone. Higher salinity-induced H+ efflux was found in the elongation zone than mature zone. However, E. angustifolia and E. purpurea had more Ca2+ influx compared to E. pallida and E. sanguinea species. Net K+ efflux decreased (> 90%) in the presence of TEA and GdCl3. Increasing of Ca2+ uptake and K+ loss in four Echinacea species roots were found in the presence of 0.3 mM Cu/Ascorbate (Cu/Asc). The significant role of H+-ATPase in H+ efflux was demonstrated by Sodium orthovanadate. Ultimately, the physiological properties of Echinacea species have a critical role in salinity-resistant/sensitive differences. Future scientific understanding of Echinacea species physiognomies may be necessary for better understanding of the plant behavior to salinity stress.\n\nOne-sentence summaryHigher K+ efflux in E. pallida and E. sanguinea species as a result of NaCl and ROS act as a metabolic switch to save energy for adaptations and repairs in salinity stress conditions.",

Among untreated animals, the mutations did not impact overall survival, and bioluminescence remained low out to >20 months of age. Vacuolization and PrP deposition were observed in some brain regions in a subset of mutant animals, but appeared unable to carry the weight of a primary endpoint in a therapeutic study.

Personal total dust samples were collected from Norwegian waste sorting plants and then characterized for fungal spores and fungal species diversity, as well as for other bioaerosol components, including endotoxins and actinobacteria. The ability of the dust to induce an NFkB response by activating Toll-like receptors 2 (TLR2) and 4 (TLR4) in vitro was evaluated as well as the relationship between such responses and quantifiable bioaerosol components. The average concentrations of bioaerosols were 7.23 mg total dust m-3, 4.49x105 fungal spores m-3, 814 endotoxin units m-3, and 0.6x105 actinobacteria m-3. The mean diversity measurements were 326; 0.59 and 3.39 for fungal richness, evenness, and Shannon Index, respectively. Overall, fungal OTUs belonging to the Ascomycotina phylum were most abundant (55%), followed by Basidiomycota (33%) and Mucormycota (3%). All samples induced significant NFkB responses through TLR2 and TLR4 activation. While fungal spore levels were positively associated with TLR2 and TLR4 activation, there was a trend that fungal species richness was negatively associated with the activation of these receptors. This observation supports the existence of divergent immunological responses relationship between fungal spore levels and fungal species diversity. Such relationships seem to be described for the first time for dust from waste facilities.",

    "abstract": "Identifying essential targets in genome-scale metabolic networks of cancer cells is a time-consuming process. This study proposed a fuzzy hierarchical optimization framework for identifying essential genes, metabolites and reactions. On the basis of four objectives, the framework can identify essential targets that lead to cancer cell death, and evaluate metabolic flux perturbations of normal cells due to treatment. Through fuzzy set theory, a multiobjective optimization problem was converted into a trilevel maximizing decision-making (MDM) problem. We applied nested hybrid differential evolution to solve the trilevel MDM problem to identify essential targets in the genome-scale metabolic models of five consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) of colorectal cancers. We used various media to identify essential targets for each CMS, and discovered that most targets affected all five CMSs and that some genes belonged to a CMS-specific model. We used the experimental data for the lethality of cancer cell lines from the DepMap database to validate the identified essential genes. The results reveal that most of the identified essential genes were compatible to colorectal cancer cell lines from DepMap and that these genes could engender a high percentage of cell death when knocked out, except for EBP, LSS and SLC7A6. The identified essential genes were mostly involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, nucleotide metabolisms, and the glycerophospholipid biosynthetic pathway. The genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway were also revealed to be determinable, if the medium used excluded a cholesterol uptake reaction. By contrast, the genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway were non-essential, if a cholesterol uptake reaction was involved in the medium used. Furthermore, the essential gene CRLS1 was revealed as a medium-independent target for all CMSs irrespective of whether a medium involves a cholesterol uptake reaction.\n\nAuthor summaryEssential genes are indispensable genes for cells to grow and proliferate under certain physiological condition. Identifying essential genes in genome-scale metabolic networks of cancer cells is a time-consuming process. We develop an anticancer target discovery platform for identifying essential genes that conduct cell death when the genes of cancer cells are deleted. Meanwhile, the essential genes are also inactive on their healthy cells to maintain their cell viability and smaller metabolic alterations. We use fuzzy set theory to measure metabolic deviation of the perturbation of normal cells relative to healthy and cancer templates towards predicting side effects for treatment of each identified gene. The platform can identify essential genes, metabolites and reactions for treating five consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) of colorectal cancers with using various media. We discovered that most targets affected all five CMSs and that some genes belonged to a CMS-specific model. We found that the genes in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway are nonessential for the cells that be compensated by a cholesterol uptake reaction from a medium. Furthermore, CRLS1 was revealed as an essential gene for all CMS colorectal cancer in a medium-independent manner that is unrelated to a cholesterol uptake reaction.",

    "abstract": "Recent developments in museomics enable genetic information to be recovered from previously unusable collection specimens and thus to answer complex taxonomic questions. Here we apply museomics to a taxonomic problem involving several species of Argyria Hubner (Pyraloidea, Crambinae), with previously unrecognized morphological variation. By analysing the DNA barcode (COI-5P) in numerous specimens, we aimed to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between species, to provide better evidence for synonymies, and to circumscribe their geographical distribution. Using an innovative DNA hybridization capture protocol, we partially recovered the DNA barcode of the lectotype of Argyria lacteella (Fabricius, 1794) for comparison with the 229 DNA barcode sequences of Argyria specimens available in the Barcode of Life Datasystems, and this firmly establishes the identity of the species. The same protocol was used for the following type specimens: the Argyria abronalis (Walker, 1859) holotype, thus confirming the synonymy of this name with A. lacteella, the holotype of A. lusella (Zeller, 1863), rev. syn., the holotype of A. multifacta Dyar, 1914, syn. n., newly synonymized with A. lacteella, and a specimen of Argyria diplomochalis Dyar, 1913, collected in 1992. A complementary sampling composed of nine specimens of A. lacteella, A. diplomochalis, A. centrifugens Dyar, 1914 and A. gonogramma Dyar, 1915, from North to South America, were integrated using classical COI amplification and Sanger sequencing. Argyria gonogramma Dyar, described from Bermuda, is the name to be applied to the more widespread North American species formerly identified as A. lacteella. Following morphological study of its holotype, Argyria vestalis Butler, 1878, syn. n. is also synonymized with A. lacteella. The name A. pusillalis Hubner, 1818, is considered a nomen dubium associated with A. gonogramma. The adult morphology is diagnosed and illustrated, and distributions are plotted for A. lacteella, A. diplomochalis, A. centrifugens, and A. gonogramma based on slightly more than 800 specimens. For the first time, DNA barcode sequences are provided for the Antillean A. diplomochalis. Our work highlights the efficiency of the DNA hybrid capture enrichment method to retrieve DNA barcodes from 18th and 19th century type specimens in order to solve taxonomic issues in Lepidoptera.",

Despite widespread efforts to design drugs targeting the ATAD2 bromodomain, little is known about the overall structural organization and AAA+ domains of ATAD2. Here, we present the 3.1 [A] cryo-EM structure of human ATAD2 in the ATP state, showing a shallow hexameric spiral that binds a peptide substrate at the central pore. The spiral conformation is locked by an N-terminal linker domain (LD) that wedges between the seam subunits, thus limiting ATP-dependent symmetry breaking of the AAA+ ring. In contrast, a structure of the ATAD2-histone H3H4 complex shows the LD undocked from the seam, suggesting that H3H4 binding unlocks the AAA+ spiral by allosterically releasing the LD. These findings, together with the discovery of an inter-subunit signaling mechanism, reveal a unique regulatory mechanism for ATAD2 and lay the foundation for developing new ATAD2 inhibitors.",

We provide a complete, quantitative model of pilus rod assembly kinetics based on the measured rate constants of FimD-catalyzed subunit incorporation. The model reliably predicts the length distribution of assembled pilus rods as a function of the ratio between FimI and the main pilus subunit FimA and is fully consistent with the length distribution of membrane-anchored pili assembled in vivo.

    "abstract": "The two non-visual arrestin isoforms, arrestin2 and arrestin3 recognize and bind hundreds of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) with different phosphorylation patterns leading to distinct functional outcomes. The impact of phosphorylation on arrestin interactions has been well studied only for very few GPCRs. Here we have characterized the interactions between the phosphorylated CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) and arrestin2. We detected several new CCR5 phosphorylation sites, which are necessary for stable complex formation with arrestin2. Crystal structures of arrestin2 in apo form and in complexes with CCR5 C-terminal phosphopeptides together with NMR spectroscopy, biochemical and functional assays revealed three phosphoresidues in a pXpp motif that are essential for the arrestin2 interactions and activation. The same phosphoresidue cluster is present in other receptors, which form stable complexes with arrestin2. We propose that the identified pXpp motif is responsible for robust arrestin2 recruitment in many GPCRs. An analysis of available sequences, structural and functional information on other GPCR*arrestin interactions suggests that a particular arrangement of phosphoresidues within the GPCR intracellular loop 3 and C-terminal tail determines arrestin2 and 3 isoform specificity. Taken together, our findings demonstrate how multi-site phosphorylation controls GPCR*arrestin interactions and provide a framework to probe the intricate details of arrestin activation and signaling.\n\nOne-sentence summaryA structural and functional analysis of arrestin2 in apo form and complexes with several CCR5 phosphopeptides reveals key phosphorylation sites responsible for stable GPCR*arrestin interactions and their contributions to CCR5-arrestin2 function.",

    "abstract": "The circadian system influences many different biological processes, including memory performance. While the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) functions as the brains central pacemaker, satellite clocks have also been identified in other brain regions, such as the memory-relevant dorsal hippocampus. Although it is unclear how these satellite clocks contribute to brain function, one possibility is that they may serve to exert diurnal control over local processes. Within the hippocampus, for example, the local clock may contribute to time-of-day effects on memory. Here, we used the hippocampus-dependent Object Location Memory task to determine how memory is regulated across the day/night cycle in mice. First, we systematically determined which phase of memory (acquisition, consolidation, or retrieval) is modulated across the 24h day. We found that mice show better long-term memory performance during the day than at night, an effect that was specifically attributed to diurnal changes in memory consolidation, as neither memory acquisition nor memory retrieval fluctuated across the day/night cycle. Using RNA-sequencing we identified the circadian clock gene Period1 (Per1) as a key mechanism capable of supporting this diurnal fluctuation in memory consolidation, as Per1 oscillates in tandem with memory performance. We then show that local knockdown of Per1 within the dorsal hippocampus has no effect on either the circadian rhythm or sleep behavior, although previous work has shown this manipulation impairs memory. Thus, Per1 may independently function within the dorsal hippocampus to regulate memory in addition to its known role in regulating the circadian rhythm within the SCN. Per1 may therefore exert local diurnal control over memory consolidation within the dorsal hippocampus.",

As the pandemic has progressed, Variants of Concern (VOC) have emerged with lineage defining mutations. Using a SARS-CoV-2 reverse genetic system, based on transformation associated recombination in yeast, a series of replicons were produced for the ancestral Wuhan virus and the SARS-CoV-2 VOC Delta in which different combinations of the Spike, membrane, ORF6 and ORF7a coding sequences were replaced with sequences encoding the selectable marker puromycin N-acetyl transferase and reporter proteins (Renilla luciferase, mNeonGreen and mScarlet). Replicon RNAs were replication competent in African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) derived cells and a range of human cell lines, with a Vero E6 cell line expressing ACE2 and TMPRSS2 showing much higher transfection efficiency and overall levels of Renilla luciferase activity. The replicons could be used for transient gene expression studies, but cell populations that stably maintained the replicons could not be propagated. Replication of the transiently expressed replicon RNA genomes was sensitive to remedesivir, providing a system to dissect the mechanism of action of antiviral compounds.",

    "abstract": "Host bottlenecks prevent many infections before the onset of disease by eliminating invading pathogens. Monitoring the diversity of a barcoded population of the diarrhea causing bacterium Citrobacter rodentium during colonization of its natural host, mice, allowed us to determine the number of cells that found the infection by establishing a replicative niche. The size of the pathogens founding population scaled with dose and was controlled by a severe yet slow-acting bottleneck. Reducing stomach acid or changing host genotype modestly relaxed the bottleneck without breaking the fractional relationship between dose and founders. In contrast, disrupting the microbiota caused the founding population to no longer scale with the size of the inoculum and allowed the pathogen to infect at almost any dose, indicating that the microbiota creates the dominant bottleneck. Further, in the absence of competition with the microbiota, the diversity of the pathogen population slowly contracted as the population was overtaken by bacteria that lost the critical virulence island, the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE). Collectively, our findings reveal that the mechanisms of protection by colonization bottlenecks are reflected in and can be generally defined by the impact of dose on the pathogens founding population.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox has been spreading worldwide since May 2022, when the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of a \"Public health emergency of international concern\". The spread of monkeypox has posed a serious threat to the health of people all over the world but few studies have been carried out on it, and the molecular mechanism of monkeypox after infection remains unclear. We therefore implemented a transcriptome analysis to identify signaling pathways and biomarkers in monkeypox-infected cells to help understand monkeypox-host cell interactions. In this study, the dataset GSE36854 and GSE11234 were obtained from GEO. Among them, 84 significantly different genes were identified in the dataset GSE36854, followed by KEGG, GO analysis protein-protein interaction (PPI) construction and Hub gene extraction. We also analyzed the expression regulation patterns of hub genes and screened the drugs targeting the hub genes. The results showed that monkeypox-infected cells significantly activated the cellular immune response, and induced inflammatory response. IER3, IFIT2, IL11, ZC3H12A, EREG, IER2, NFKBIE, FST, IFIT1 and AREG were the top 10 hub genes, in which anti-viral gene IFIT1 and IFIT2 were significantly suppressed. AP-26113 and itraconazole promoting the expression of IFIT1 and IFIT2 may be used as new candidates for the treatment of monkeypox viral infection. Our results provide a new entry point for understanding the mode of interaction between monkeypox virus and its host.",

    "abstract": "African catfish (Clarias gariepinus) is a promising food fish species with significant potential and growing mass of production in freshwater aquaculture. Male African catfish possess improved production characteristics over females, therefore the use of monosex populations could be advantageous for aquaculture production. However, our knowledge about the sex determination mechanism of this species is still limited and controversial. A previously isolated male-specific DNA marker (CgaY1) was validated using offspring groups from targeted crosses (n=630) and it was found to predict the sex of 608 individuals correctly (96.43% accuracy). Using the proportion of recombinants, we estimated the average genetic distance between the potential sex determination locus and the sex-specific marker to be 2.69 cM. As an earlier study suggested that both XX/XY and ZZ/ZW systems coexist in this species, we tested the applicability of their putative  moderately sex-linked loci and found that no sex-specific amplification could be detected for any of them. In addition, temperature-induced masculinization suggested by others was also tested, but no such effect was detected in our stocks when the published parameters were used for heat treatment. Altogether, our results support an exclusive XX/XY sex determination system in our African catfish stock and indicate a good potential for the future use of this male-specific DNA marker in research and commercial production.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) are at increased risk of thrombosis, which is associated with altered platelet function and coagulopathy, contributing to excess mortality.\n\nObjectivesWe aimed to characterise the mechanism of altered platelet function in COVID-19 patients.\n\nMethodsThe platelet proteome, platelet functional responses and platelet-neutrophil aggregates were compared between patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and healthy control subjects using Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) proteomic analysis, Western blotting and flow cytometry.\n\nResultsCOVID-19 patients showed a different profile of platelet protein expression (858 altered out of 5773 quantified). Levels of COVID-19 plasma markers were enhanced in COVID-19 platelets. Gene ontology (GO) pathway analysis demonstrated that levels of granule secretory proteins were raised, whereas some platelet activation proteins, such as the thrombopoietin receptor and PKC, were lowered. Basally, COVID-19 platelets showed enhanced phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure, with unaltered integrin IIb{beta}3 activation and P-selectin expression. Agonist-stimulated integrin IIb{beta}3 activation and PS exposure, but not P-selectin expression, were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients had high levels of platelet-neutrophil aggregates, even under basal conditions, compared to controls. This interaction was disrupted by blocking P-selectin, demonstrating that platelet P-selectin is critical for the interaction.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our data suggests the presence of two platelet populations in patients with COVID-19: one with circulating platelets with an altered proteome and reduced functional responses and another with P-selectin expressing neutrophil-associated platelets. Platelet driven thromboinflammation may therefore be one of the key factors enhancing the risk of thrombosis in COVID-19 patients.\n\nEssentials- COVID-19 patient platelet function and platelet proteins were compared with healthy controls\n- Proteomic analysis of platelets indicated that COVID-19 decreased platelet activation proteins\n- Agonist induced PS exposure and integrin IIb{beta}3 activation were impaired in COVID-19\n- COVID-19 led to maximal levels of P-selectin dependent platelet-neutrophil aggregates",

LDpred2-auto can infer the two parameters from the LDpred model, the SNP heritability h2 and polygenicity p, so that it does not require an additional validation dataset to choose best-performing parameters. The main aim of this paper is to properly validate the use of LDpred2-auto for inferring multiple genetic parameters. Here, we present a new version of LDpred2-auto that adds an optional third parameter  to its model, for modeling negative selection. We then validate the inference of these three parameters (or two, when using the previous model). We also show that LDpred2-auto provides per-variant probabilities of being causal that are well calibrated, and can therefore be used for fine-mapping purposes. We also derive a new formula to infer the out-of-sample predictive performance r2 of the resulting PGS directly from the Gibbs sampler of LDpred2-auto. Finally, we extend the set of HapMap3 variants recommended to use with LDpred2 with 37% more variants to improve the coverage of this set, and show that this new set of variants captures 12% more heritability and provides 6% more predictive performance, on average, in UK Biobank analyses.",

    "abstract": "Ancylostoma caninum is an important zoonotic gastrointestinal nematode of dogs worldwide and a close relative of human hookworms. We recently reported that racing greyhounds in the USA are infected with A. caninum that are commonly resistant to multiple anthelmintics. Benzimidazole resistance in A. caninum in greyhounds was associated with a high frequency of the canonical F167Y(TTC>TAC) isotype-1 {beta}-tubulin mutation. In this work, we show that benzimidazole resistance is remarkably widespread in A. caninum from domestic dogs across the USA. First, we identified and showed the functional significance of a novel benzimidazole isotype-1 {beta}-tubulin resistance mutation, Q134H(CAA>CAT). Several benzimidazole resistant A. caninum isolates from greyhounds with a low frequency of the F167Y(TTC>TAC) mutation had a high frequency of a Q134H(CAA>CAT) mutation not previously reported from any eukaryotic pathogen in the field. Structural modeling predicted that the Q134 residue is directly involved in benzimidazole drug binding and that the 134H substitution would significantly reduce binding affinity. Introduction of the Q134H substitution into the C. elegans {beta}-tubulin gene ben-1, by CRISPR-Cas9 editing, conferred similar levels of resistance as a ben-1 null allele. Deep amplicon sequencing on A. caninum eggs from 685 hookworm positive pet dog fecal samples revealed that both mutations were widespread across the USA, often at high frequency, with prevalences of 49.7% (overall frequency 54.0%) and 31.1% (overall frequency 16.4%) for F167Y(TTC>TAC) and Q134H(CAA>CAT), respectively. Canonical codon 198 and 200 benzimidazole resistance mutations were absent. The F167Y(TTC>TAC) mutation had a significantly higher prevalence and frequency in Western USA than in other regions, which we hypothesize is due to differences in refugia. This work has important implications for companion animal parasite control and the potential emergence of drug resistance in human hookworms.\n\nAuthor SummaryAlthough increasingly common in livestock, no reports of widespread anthelmintic resistance are confirmed in any companion animal or human gastrointestinal nematode parasite to date. The canine hookworm is a common intestinal zoonotic parasite of dogs with severe clinical impacts in young dogs, and for which control is dependent on regular anthelmintic use. We recently reported multiple anthelmintic drug resistance in A. caninum isolates from greyhounds derived from multiple locations in the USA likely caused by long standing intensive treatment regimens in kennels. In this study, we investigated benzimidazole resistance in A. caninum in pet dogs across the USA. We also identified and showed the functional significance of a novel benzimidazole isotype-1 {beta}-tubulin resistance mutation in A. caninum from greyhounds that has not been previously reported in the field for any organism. We then determined that this novel mutation, as well as a previously characterized resistance mutation, were present, often at high frequency, in many A. caninum populations across the USA. This study reports the first evidence of widespread drug resistance for any parasitic nematode of companion animals and illustrates the power of molecular approaches to rapidly assess anthelmintic resistance in a region.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a frequently chronic kidney pathology derived from diabetes comorbidity. This condition has irreversible damage, and its risk factor increases with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The prognostic outcome for diabetic patients with COVID-19 is dismal, even with intensive medical treatment. However, there is still scarce information on critical genes involved in the pathophysiological impact of COVID-19 on DKD. Herein, we characterize differential expression gene (DEG) profiles and determine hub genes undergoing transcriptional reprogramming in both disease conditions. Out of 995 DEGs, we identified 42 DEGs shared with COVID-19 pathways. Enrichment analysis elucidated that they are significantly induced with implications for immune and inflammatory responses. By performing a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and applying topological methods, we determine the following five hub genes STAT1, IRF7, ISG15, MX1, and OAS1. Then, by network deconvolution, we determine their co-expressed gene modules. Moreover, we validate the conservancy of their upregulation using the Coronascape database (DB). Finally, tissue-specific regulation of the five predictive hub genes indicates that OAS1 and MX1 expression levels are lower in healthy kidney tissue. Altogether, our results suggest that these genes could play an essential role in developing severe outcomes of COVID-19 in DKD patients.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTuberculosis (TB) is a leading infectious cause of death worldwide and treating latent TB infection (LTBI) with TB preventative therapy is a global priority. This study aimed to measure interferon gamma (IFN-{gamma}) release assay (IGRA) positivity (the current reference standard for LTBI diagnosis) and Mtb-specific IgG antibodies in otherwise healthy HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults.\n\nMethodsOne-hundred and eighteen adults (65 HIV-negative and 53 antiretroviral-naive HIV-positive), from a peri-urban setting in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were enrolled. IFN-{gamma} release following stimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides and plasma IgG antibodies specific for multiple Mtb antigens were measured using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT) and customized Luminex assays, respectively. The relationships between QFT status and anti-Mtb IgG levels and HIV-status, sex, age and CD4 count were analyzed.\n\nFindingsOlder age, male sex and higher CD4 count were independently associated with QFT positivity (p = 0.045, 0.05 and 0.002 respectively). There was no difference in QFT status between HIV-positive and HIV-negative groups (58% and 65% respectively, p = 0.06), but within CD4 count quartiles, people with HIV had higher QFT positivity than people without HIV (p = 0.008 (2nd quartile), <0.0001 (3rd quartile)). Mtb-specific IFN-{gamma} levels were lowest, and Mtb-specific IgGs were highest in HIV-positive individuals with the lowest CD4 counts.\n\nInterpretationThese results suggest that the QFT assay underestimates LTBI among immunosuppressed people with HIV and Mtb-specific IgG may be a useful alternative biomarker for Mtb infection. Further evaluation of how Mtb-specific antibodies can be leveraged to improve LTBI diagnosis is warranted, particularly in HIV-endemic areas.\n\nFundingThe study was funded by the NIH/NIAID [K08AI118538] (EBW) and, in part, by the Africa Health Research Institute through the Wellcome [Strategic Core award: 201433/Z/16/A].

However, since these tests measure immunoreactivity to Mtb peptides, they are indirect measures of Mtb infection and their performance characteristics are impacted by co-infections and comorbidities that influence immune responses, including HIV. Recently, a human phenotype has been defined in people who are highly exposed to Mtb but consistently test negative for evidence of Mtb infection by IGRA and tuberculin skin test (TST). These individuals have been observed to have a unique profile of Mtb-specific antibodies when compared to the classical IGRA positive LTBI group, suggesting that Mtb-specific antibodies may identify additional people with a history of Mtb infection or exposure when compared to IGRA alone. Comparison of IGRA and Mtb-specific antibodies in people living with HIV has not previously been performed.\n\nAdded value of this studyHere, we concurrently assessed Mtb-specific IFN-{gamma} production and IgG in a cohort of 118 well-defined HIV-negative and antiretroviral naive HIV-positive individuals from KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, a highly TB endemic area. We found a discrepancy between Mtb-specific IFN-{gamma} and Mtb-specific IgG levels, particularly in HIV-positive individuals with low CD4 cell counts. Notably people with the lowest CD4 counts had the highest levels of Mtb-specific IgG levels in the plasma, and the lowest levels of QTF positivity.\n\nImplications of all evidence availableIGRAs may underestimate Mtb infection status, especially in people with HIV infection or who have T cell depletion or dysfunction. Mtb-specific IgG antibodies indicate development of a B cell response to Mtb and may have promise as an alternative biomarker of TB immunoreactivity that does not depend on T cell function.",

    "abstract": "There are major differences between viruses, bacteria, and eukaryotic cells in the structuring of their genomes, modes of replication, and capacity to horizontally transfer genetic sequences. DNA sequencing of a cloned African green monkey simian cytomegalovirus (SCMV) indicate the inclusion of certain bacterial and cellular genetic sequences. The virus was cultured from a chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patient. It is stealth adapted with the loss or mutation of the genes coding for the relatively few viral components normally targeted by the cellular immune system. This article identifies the likely origins of many of the bacterial-derived genetic sequences present in this virus. There are multiple clones with close but non-identical sequence alignments with different genomic regions of the Ochrobactrum quorumnocens A44 species of bacteria. Another set of clones matched most closely to diverse genomic regions of Mycoplasma fermentans bacteria. The sequences of several other clones could only be approximately aligned to those of different types of bacteria. The sequence of clone 3B513 is consistent with genetic contributions from the genomes of several types of bacteria. The term viteria refers to viruses with bacteria-derived genetic sequences. Stealth adapted viruses are the likely primary cause of CFS and autism, and possibly act as cofactors in many illnesses including AIDS. The additional incorporation of bacterial sequences into these viruses can potentially lead to the mistaken diagnoses of a bacterial chronic illness rather than a viral infection. Stealth adapted virus testing should be performed in illnesses attributed to Mycoplasma, Borrelia, and Streptococcal infections.",

    "abstract": "The human microbiome has been studied extensively across those sites in the body that are readily accessible to sampling. Internal organs and tissues, however, have remained largely unexplored and, in the absence of infectious disease, are widely assumed to be free of microorganisms. Using single-cell transcriptomic data from the Tabula Sapiens spanning 11 human organ donors, 19 tissue types, 400,000+ annotated cells, 100+ cell types, and [~]70 billion sequences, we created an atlas of the human tissue microbiome with cell type resolution across three domains of life which we refer to as the Tabula Sapiens Microbiome. Together with data from 8 additional donors derived from a different set of experimental techniques for validation, we identified sequences from numerous bacterial, viral and fungal species in human tissues. We mapped the likely microbial flow routes in the body from external-facing microbiomes and natural environments to internal tissues and tumors, demonstrating the existence of several unexpected routes. In the case of tumor microbiomes, we find a considerable number of bacterial genera found in tumors are detectable across tumor-free tissues, suggesting that tumor microbiomes are in part sourced from adjacent normal tissues, even those from distant sites. Finally, by increasing the resolution of sampling from tissues to cell types, we quantified the microbial load and diversity across different human cell types to reveal a network of host cell type and microbe associations. For example, we identified traces of both latent and active Epstein Barr Virus infections in various cell types such as splenic plasma cells. Broad exploration of the human tissue microbiomes may provide insights which ultimately are of clinical importance.",

    "abstract": "The human microbiome has been proposed as a useful biomarker for several different human diseases including various cancers. To answer this question, we examined salivary samples from two Canadian population cohorts, the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrows Health project (PATH) and Albertas Tomorrow Project (ATP). Sample selection was then divided into both a retrospective and prospective case control design examining individuals with prostate, breast, or colon cancer. In total 89 retrospective and 260 prospective cancer cases were matched to non-cancer controls and saliva samples were sequenced using 16S rRNA gene sequencing to compare bacterial diversity, and taxonomic composition. We found no significant differences in alpha or beta diversity across any of the three cancer types and two study designs. Although retrospective colon cancer samples did show evidence on visual clustering in weighted beta diversity metrics. Differential abundance analysis of individual taxon showed several taxa that were associated with previous cancer diagnosis in all three groupings within the retrospective study design. However, only one genus (Ruminococcaceae UCG-014) in breast cancer and one ASV (Fusobacterium periodonticum) in colon cancer was identified by more than one differential abundance (DA) tool. In prospective cases of disease three ASVs were associated with colon cancer, one ASV with breast cancer, and one ASV with prostate cancer. None overlapped between the two different study cohorts. Attempting to identify microbial signals using Random Forest classification showed relatively low levels of signal in both prospective and retrospective cases of breast and prostate cancer (AUC range: 0.394-0.665). Contrastingly, colon cancer did show signal in our retrospective analysis (AUC: 0.745) and in one of two prospective cohorts (AUC: 0.717). Overall, our results indicate that it is unlikely that reliable oral microbial biomarkers of disease exist in the context of both breast and prostate cancer. However, they do suggest that further research into the relationship between the oral microbiome and colon cancer could be fruitful. Particularly in the context of early disease progression and risk of cancer development.",

    "abstract": "The general lack of permeability of small molecules observed for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is most commonly ascribed to its unique cell envelope. More specifically, the outer mycomembrane is hypothesized to be the principal determinant for access of antibiotics to their molecular targets. Nonetheless, there is limited information on the types of molecular scaffolds that can readily permeate past the mycomembrane of mycobacteria. To address this, we describe a novel assay that combines metabolic tagging of the peptidoglycan scaffold, which sits directly beneath the mycomembrane, and a fluorescent labeling chase step, to measure the permeation of small molecules. We showed that the assay workflow was robust and compatible with high-throughput analysis in Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mtb. A small panel of molecules was tested and we found a large range in the permeability profile of molecules. Interestingly, the general trend is similar across the two types of mycobacteria, with some notable exceptions. We anticipate that this assay platform will lay the foundation for medicinal chemistry efforts to understand and improve uptake of both existing drugs and newly-discovered compounds into mycobacteria. The methods described, which do not require genetic manipulation, can be generally adopted to other species for which envelope permeability is treatment-limiting.",

    "abstract": "One-carbon (C1) compounds are promising feedstocks for sustainable production of commodity chemicals. CO2 is a particularly advantageous C1-feedstock since it is an unwanted industrial off-gas that can be converted to valuable products while reducing its atmospheric levels. Acetogens are known microorganisms that can grow on CO2/H2 and syngas converting these substrates into ethanol and acetate. Co-cultivation of acetogens with microbes that can further process such products can expand the variety of products to, for example, medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) and longer chain alcohols. Solventogens are microorganisms known to produce MCFA and alcohols via the acetone, butanol and ethanol (ABE) fermentation in which acetate is a key metabolite. Thus, co-cultivation of a solventogen and acetogen in a consortium provides a potential platform to produce valuable chemicals from CO2.\n\nIn this study, metabolic modelling was implemented to design a new co-culture of an acetogen and a solventogen to produce butyrate from CO2/H2 mixtures. The model-driven approach suggested the ability of the studied solventogenic species to grow on lactate/glycerol with acetate as co-substrate. This ability was confirmed experimentally by cultivation of Clostridium beijerinckii on these substrates in serum bottles and subsequently in pH-controlled bioreactors.\n\nCommunity modelling also suggested that a novel microbial consortium consisting of the acetogen Clostridium autoethanogenum, and the solventogen C. beijerinckii would be feasible and stable. On the basis of this prediction, a co-culture was experimentally established. C. autoethanogenum grew on CO2/H2 producing acetate and traces of ethanol. Acetate was in turn, consumed by C. beijerinckii together with lactate, producing butyrate. These results show that community modelling of metabolism is a valuable tool to guide the design of microbial consortia for the tailored production of chemicals from renewable resources.",

    "abstract": "Daptomycin is a membrane-targeting lipopeptide antibiotic used in the treatment of infective endocarditis caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, enterococci and viridans group streptococci. Despite demonstrating excellent in vitro activity and a low prevalence of resistant isolates, treatment failure is a significant concern, particularly for enterococcal infection. We have shown recently that human serum triggers daptomycin tolerance in S. aureus, but it was not clear if a similar phenotype occurred in other major infective endocarditis pathogens. We found that Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus gordonii or Streptococcus mutans grown under standard laboratory conditions were efficiently killed by daptomycin, whereas bacteria pre-incubated in human serum survived exposure to the antibiotic, with >99% cells remaining viable. Incubation of enterococci or streptococci in serum led to peptidoglycan accumulation, as shown by increased incorporation of the fluorescent D-amino analogue HADA. Inhibition of peptidoglycan accumulation using the antibiotic fosfomycin resulted in a >10-fold reduction in serum-induced daptomycin tolerance, demonstrating the important contribution of the cell wall to the phenotype. We also identified a small contribution to daptomycin tolerance in E. faecalis from cardiolipin synthases, although this may reflect the inherent susceptibility of cardiolipin-deficient mutants. In summary, serum-induced daptomycin tolerance is a consistent phenomenon between Gram-positive infective endocarditis pathogens, but it may be mitigated using currently available antibiotic combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Inactivation of Listeria monocytogenes ATCC 19115 and Salmonella enterica serovar Muenchen ATCC BAA 1764 by a light emitting diodes (LED) operating at 279 nm was investigated. In addition, this investigation assessed the poly-phenolic and vitamin content of UV irradiated apple juice (AJ). Specific concentrations of bacteria were inoculated in AJ and irradiated at the designated UV doses of 0 to 10 mJ{middle dot}cm-2 for Salmonella Muenchen and 0 to 12 mJ{middle dot}cm-2 for Listeria monocytogenes.Results show that UV-C irradiation effectively inactivated pathogenic microbes in AJ. The log reduction kinetics of microorganisms followed log-linear and with higher R2 (>0.95). The D10 values of 3.50 and 3.56 mJ{middle dot}cm-2 were obtained from the inactivation of Salmonella Muenchen, and Listeria monocytogenes in apple juice. In addition, quantifiable UV-C doses ranging from 0 to 160 mJ{middle dot}cm-2 were also delivered to AJ and polyphenols and vitamins were profiled. LC-MS/MS analysis was conducted to assess the stability of polyphenols or vitamins in UV-C exposed AJ. The polyphenol and vitamin results demonstrated that UV-C irradiation in AJ can cause significant reductions (p<0.05) if not properly delivered. Chlorogenic acid was reduced to 56%, at 80 mJ/cm2 whereas 12% reduction was observed at 40 mJ/cm2. Choline was observed to be relatively stable as a function of UV-C dosage. In contrast thiamine was significantly reduced at higher doses. In addition, Epicatechin was significantly reduced at high exposure doses. In contrast minor changes were observed at 40 mJ/cm2. The results from this study imply that adequate log reduction of pathogens is achievable in AJ and suggest significant potential of using LED devices for UV-C treatment of highly turbid fluids.",

    "abstract": "Angiopoietin ligands Ang1 and Ang2 and the Tie2 receptor tyrosine kinases form an endothelial signaling pathway regulating vascular homeostasis and controlling vessel permeability, inflammation and angiogenic responses. Whereas Ang1-mediated Tie2 activation reduces inflammation and endothelial permeability, its antagonist, Ang2 increases it. Increased plasma Ang2 levels are associated with poor outcomes in patients with acute lung injury (ALI), as well as in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n\nIn the study presented here we tested the effect of a novel synthetic, nucleoside-modified mRNA-76 encoding for a hyperactive Ang1 derived fusion protein (COMP-Ang1) on attenuating post-inflammation vascular leakage. COMP-Ang1 mRNA was formulated into a cationic lipid nanoparticle (cLNP) using an optimized mixture of three different lipids and a microfluidic mixing technology. After intravenous injection, the respective mRNA-loaded LNPs were found to be delivered predominantly to the endothelial cells of the lung, while sparing other vascular beds. Also, the specific multimeric folding of the COMP-Ang1 protein complex appeared to be pivotal for its activity in preventing vascular leakage and in restoring the alveolar-endothelial barrier function in the inflamed and injured pulmonary vasculature. The mode of action of mRNA-76, such as its activation of the Tie2 signal transduction pathway, was tested by pharmacological studies in vitro and in vivo by systemic administration in respective mouse models. mRNA-76 was found to prevent lung vascular leakage/lung edema as well as neutrophil infiltration in an LPS-challenging model.",

Corneal inflammation, including via the NF{kappa}B pathway, plays a key etiological role in DED. Recombinant human proteoglycan 4 (rhPRG4) has been shown to be a clinically effective treatment for DED that has anti-inflammatory effects in corneal epithelial cells, but the underlying mechanism is still not understood. Our goal was to understand if rhPRG4 affects TNF-stimulated inflammatory activity in corneal epithelial cells. We treated hTERT-immortalized corneal epithelial (hTCEpi) cells {+/-}TNF {+/-}rhPRG4 and performed Western blotting on cell lysate and RNA sequencing. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that rhPRG4 had a significant effect on TNF-mediated inflammation with potential effects on matricellular homeostasis. rhPRG4 reduced activation of key inflammatory pathways and decreased expression of transcripts for key inflammatory cytokines, interferons, interleu-kins, and transcription factors. TNF treatment significantly increased phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65, and rhPRG4 significantly reduced both these effects. RNA sequencing identified FAT10, which has not been studied in the context of DED, as a key pro-inflammatory transcript increased by TNF and decreased by rhPRG4. These results were confirmed at the protein level. In summary, rhPRG4 is able to downregulate NF{kappa}B activity in hTCEpi cells, suggesting a potential biological mechanism by which it may act as a therapeutic for DED.",

    "abstract": "TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), a dimeric serine/threonine protein kinase, plays a critical role in multiple signaling pathways including innate immunity, autophagy and cell death. TBK1 is activated by the phosphorylation of an essential serine residue 172 (S172) within the activation loop of the kinase domain, and this phosphorylation can occur by trans-autophosphorylation: one TBK1 dimer phosphorylates a second dimer at S172. Here we show that phosphorylation of TBK1 S172 in cultured human cells in response to multiple inducers is reduced, but not abolished by the highly specific and potent TBK1 small molecule inhibitor GSK8612. Thus, upstream kinase(s) must phosphorylate TBK1 in response to inducers in cultured cells. We show that distinct upstream kinases are recruited for the activation of TBK1 in response to different inducers. We also identify extensive crosstalk among TBK1, IKK{beta} and IKK{varepsilon} kinases in the cellular response to various inducers. In addition, we show that dsDNA and dsRNA trigger dynamic intracellular translocation of TBK1, leading to its localization and activation on the Golgi apparatus or mitochondria, respectively. GSK8612 does not block the intracellular localization of TBK1. We conclude that TBK1 is activated by both upstream kinase phosphorylation and by trans-autophosphorylation, and the signal-dependent spatial engagement of TBK1 with other signaling molecules is a fundamental mechanism for its specific activation by multiple inducers.",

To address this gap, and explore the biochemical and cell biological features of viral assembly, we have employed an improved virus-like particle (VLP) system. We exploited the small nanoLuciferase protein for enhanced signal and surprisingly found that the protein itself appears to be packaged into both SARS CoV2 VLPs and virions and secreted from cells. Interestingly, nLuc is not co-secreted with dengue or Zika infection, suggesting the large virion of Coronavirus can encaspidate and secrete a cellularly expressed reporter protein.

    "abstract": "Aniridia is a rare, pan-ocular disease causing severe sight loss, with only symptomatic intervention offered to patients. Approximately 40% of aniridia patients present with heterozygous nonsense variants in PAX6, resulting in haploinsufficiency. Translational readthrough inducing compounds (TRIDs) have the ability to weaken the recognition of in-frame premature stop codons (PTCs), permitting full-length protein to be translated. We have established induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived 3D optic cups and 2D limbal epithelial stem cell (LESC) models from an aniridia patient with a prevalent PAX6 nonsense mutation. Both in vitro models show reduced PAX6 protein levels, mimicking the disease. Repurposed TRIDs amlexanox and 2,6-diaminopurine (DAP), and positive control compounds ataluren and G418 were tested for their efficiency. Amlexanox was identified as the most promising TRID, increasing full-length PAX6 levels in both models, and rescuing the disease phenotype through normalization of VSX2 and cell proliferation in the optic cups and reduction of ABCG2 protein and SOX10 expression in LESC. This study highlights the significance of patient iPSC-derived cells as a new model system for aniridia and proposes amlexanox as a new putative treatment for nonsense-mediated aniridia.",

We present a method for simultaneous profiling of long-range genetic/epigenetic changes in matched cancer samples. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common subtype of kidney cancer. Most ccRCC cases demonstrate somatic genomic alterations involving the short arm of chromosome 3 (3p), most often targeting the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene. Aiming to identify somatic alterations that characterize early stage ccRCC, we performed comprehensive genetic, cytogenetic and epigenetic analyses comparing ccRCC tumor to adjacent non-tumorous tissue. Optical genome mapping identified genomic aberrations such as structural and copy number variations, complementing exome-sequencing results. Single-molecule methylome and hydroxymethylome mapping revealed multiple differential regions, some of them known to be associated with ccRCC pathogenesis. Among them, metabolic pathways were significantly enriched. Moreover, significant global epigenetic differences were detected between the tumor and the adjacent non-tumorous tissue, and a correlation between epigenetic signals and gene expression was found. This is the first reported comparison of a human tumor and a matched tissue by optical genome/epigenome mapping, revealing well-established and novel somatic aberrations.",

Enzymes cluster into four distinct clades that differ in sequence length and composition. Like many of the previously studied PHBase proteins, there is a high degree of heterogeneity at the genus level. Ancestor sequences were calculated for each tree node using a maximum likelihood approach. The most ancestral sequence and one extant enzyme from each of the clades were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified to homogeneity, and characterized. The ancestral enzyme binds substrate more efficiently, is kinetically faster, and is more stable at elevated temperatures compared to the extant enzymes. Hence, an evolutionary phylogenetic approach is a viable alternative to other techniques for identifying optimized enzymes for industrial PHB degradation.",

    "abstract": "The RING-between-RING (RBR) E3 ubiquitin ligase family in humans comprises 14 members and is defined by a two-step catalytic mechanism in which ubiquitin is first transferred from an E2 to the RBR active site and then to the substrate. To define the core features of this catalytic mechanism, we structurally and biochemically characterise the two RBRs HOIL-1 and RNF216. Crystal structures of both enzymes in their RBR/E2-Ub/Ub transthiolation complexes capturing the first catalytic step, in combination with complementary functional experiments, reveal the defining features of the RBR catalytic mechanism. RBRs catalyse ubiquitination via a conserved transthiolation complex structure that enables efficient E2-to-RBR ubiquitin transfer. Our data also highlight a conserved RBR allosteric mechanism by distinct ubiquitin linkages that suggests that RBRs employ a feed-forward mechanism accelerating their signalling pathways. We finally identify that the HOIL-1 RING2 domain contains an unusual Zn2/Cys6 bivalent zinc cluster that may represent a specific adaptation enabling HOIL-1s atypical substrate specificity.",

    "abstract": "Animals rely on chemosensory cues to survive in pathogen-rich environments. In C. elegans, pathogenic bacteria are known to trigger aversive behaviors through neuronal perception, and to activate molecular defenses throughout the animal. This suggests that neurons may be able to coordinate the activation of organism-wide defensive responses upon pathogen perception. We find that exposure to volatile pathogen-associated compounds induces cell non-autonomous activation of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPRER) in peripheral tissues following xbp-1 splicing in neurons. This odorant-induced UPRER activation is dependent upon transforming growth factor beta (TGF-{beta}) signaling and leads to extended lifespan and enhanced clearance of toxic proteins. Our data suggest that the cell non-autonomous UPRER rewires organismal proteostasis in response to pathogen detection, pre-empting the arrival of proteotoxic stress. Thus, chemosensation of particular odors may be a novel way to manipulate stress responses and longevity.",

The lack of approaches for conditional gene perturbation, however, has made it challenging to investigate the late developmental functions of genes that have essential roles during early embryogenesis and genes that have diverse functions in multiple tissues. The doxycycline-controlled Tet-On system is a widely used molecular tool for temporally and spatially regulated transgene expression. Here, we optimized the Tet-On system to conditionally induce gene expression in sea urchin embryos. Using this approach, we explored the roles the MAPK signaling plays in skeletogenesis by expressing genes that perturb the pathway specifically in primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) during later stages of development. We demonstrated the wide utility of the Tet-On system by applying it to a second sea urchin species and in cell types other than the PMCs. Our work provides a robust and flexible platform for the spatio-temporal regulation of gene expression in sea urchins, which will considerably enhance the utility of this prominent model system.",

We generated a Igfbp2-CreER knockin strain, which specifically labels midlobular hepatocytes. During homeostasis over 1 year, zone 2 hepatocytes increased in abundance from occupying 21% to 41% of the lobular area. After either pericentral injury with carbon tetrachloride or periportal injury with DDC, IGFBP2+ cells replenished lost hepatocytes in zones 3 and 1, respectively. IGFBP2+ cells also preferentially contributed to regeneration after 70% partial hepatectomy, as well as liver growth during pregnancy. Because IGFBP2 labeling increased substantially with fasting, we used single nuclear transcriptomics to explore zonation as a function of nutrition, revealing that the zonal division of labor shifts dramatically with fasting.

First, mESCs were differentiated into epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) to enhance the PP differentiation rate. Next, PPs and MPs aggregated together giving rise to various pancreatic cell types, including endocrine, acinar, and ductal cells, and to endothelial cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis revealed a larger endocrine population within the PP+MP aggregates, as compared to PPs alone or PPs in Matrigel aggregates. The PP+MP aggregate gene expression signatures and its endocrine population percentage closely resembled those of the endocrine population found in the mouse embryonic pancreas, which holds promise for studying pancreas development.",

We investigated how age and obesity/metabolic syndrome impact fertility and hypothesized that its decrease is due to defects in preimplantation embryo development.\n\nMethodsThree groups of female C57Bl6 mice (12 weeks, 9 months and 1 year old) were fed either a high fat diet for 8 weeks, to induce obesity and the metabolic syndrome, or a control chow diet. Body weight and composition, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance were assessed. Fecundity was evaluated by mating and pregnancy rates, as well as number of embryos. Embryo quality was assessed morphologically, and cell fate composition was analysed in preimplantation embryos by state-of-the-art single cell quantitative confocal image analysis.\n\nResultsThe high fat diet was associated with increased adiposity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, especially in the older mice. Fecundity was affected by age, more than by the diet. Both age and high fat diet were associated with reduced cell fate allocation, indicating a delay in preimplantation embryo development, and with increased expression of GATA3, an inhibitor of placentation.\n\nConclusion/InterpretationThese results support that age and the metabolic syndrome reduce fertility through mechanisms which are present at conception very early in pregnancy.\n\nWhat is already known about this subject?O_LILifestyle changes in modern societies have led to an increase in obesity and type 2 diabetes, and women tend to become pregnant later than ever.

    "abstract": "Maternal effects are an important source of phenotypic variance, whereby females influence offspring developmental trajectory beyond direct genetic contributions, often in response to changing environmental conditions. However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms by which maternal experience is translated into molecular signals that shape offspring development. One such signal may be maternal RNA transcripts (mRNAs and miRNAs) deposited into maturing oocytes. These regulate the earliest stages of development of all animals, but are understudied in most insects. Here we investigated the effects of female internal (body condition) and external (time of season) environmental conditions on maternal RNA in the maturing oocytes and 24 hr old eggs of alfalfa leafcutting bees. Using gene expression and WGCNA analysis, we found that females adjust the quantity of mRNAs related to protein phosphorylation, transcriptional regulation, and nuclease activity deposited into maturing oocytes in response to both poor body condition and shorter day lengths that accompany the late season. However, the magnitude of these changes was higher for time of season. Females also adjusted miRNA deposition in response to seasonal changes, but not body condition. We did not observe significant changes in maternal RNAs in response to either body condition or time of season in 24-hr-old eggs, which were past the maternal-to-zygotic transition. Our results suggest that females adjust the RNA transcripts they provide for offspring to regulate development in response to both internal and external environmental cues. Variation in maternal RNAs may, therefore, be important for regulating offspring phenotype in response to environmental change.",

Building on general theories linking growth to metabolic rates, we develop causal parametric models of height and weight growth incorporating a novel representation of human body allometry and a phase-partitioned representation of ontogeny. These models permit separation of metabolic causes of growth variation, potentially influenced by diet and disease, from allometric factors, potentially under strong genetic control. We estimate model parameters using a Bayesian multilevel statistical design applied to temporally-dense height and weight measurements of U.S. children, and temporally-sparse measurements of Indigenous Amazonian children. This facilitates a comparison of the metabolic and allometric contributions to observed cross-cultural variation in the growth trajectories of the two populations. These theoretical growth models constitute an initial step toward a better understanding of the causes of growth variation in our species, while potentially guiding the development of appropriate, and desired, healthcare interventions in societies confronting growth-related health challenges.\n\nShort SummaryNew causal models of human growth facilitate cross-cultural comparisons of metabolism and allometry.",

    "abstract": "Laryngeal morphotypes have been hypothesized related to both phonation and to laryngeal pathologies. Morphotypes have not been validated or demonstrated quantitatively and sources of shape and size variation are incompletely understood but could be critical for the explanation of behavioral changes (e.g., changes of physical properties of a voice) and for therapeutic approaches to the larynx. Therefore results are likely to have implications for surgeons and speech language pathologists. A stratified human sample was interrogated for phenotypic variation of the vocal organ. First, computed tomography image stacks were used to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of the thyroid cartilage. Then cartilage shapes were quantified using multivariate statistical analysis of high dimensional shape data from margins and surfaces of the thyroid cartilage. The effects of sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and body height on size and shape differences were analyzed. We found that sex, age, BMI and the age-sex interaction showed significant effects on the mixed sex sample. Among males, only age showed a strong effect. The thyroid cartilage increased in overall size, and the angulation between left and right lamina decreased in older males. Age, BMI and the age-height interaction were statistically significant factors within females. The angulation between left and right lamina increased in older females and was smaller in females with greater BMI. A cluster analysis confirmed the strong age effect on larynx shape in males and a complex interaction between the age, BMI and height variables in the female sample. The investigation demonstrated that age and BMI, two risk factors in a range of clinical conditions, are associated with shape and size variation of the human larynx. The effects influence shape differently in female and male larynges. The male-female shape dichotomy is partly size-dependent but predominantly size-independent.",

    "abstract": "Upon nutrient limitation, budding yeast of Saccharomyces cerevisiae shift from fast growth (the log stage) to quiescence (the stationary stage). This shift is accompanied by liquid-liquid phase separation in the membrane of the vacuole, an endosomal organelle. Recent work indicates that the resulting micron-scale domains in vacuole membranes enable yeast to survive periods of stress. An outstanding question is which molecular changes might cause this membrane phase separation. Here, we conduct lipidomics of vacuole membranes in both the log and stationary stages. Isolation of pure vacuole membranes is challenging in the stationary stage, when lipid droplets are in close contact with vacuoles. Immuno-isolation has previously been shown to successfully purify log-stage vacuole membranes with high organelle specificity, but it was not previously possible to immuno-isolate stationary stage vacuole membranes. Here, we develop Mam3 as a bait protein for vacuole immuno-isolation, and demonstrate low contamination by non-vacuolar membranes. We find that stationary stage vacuole membranes contain surprisingly high fractions of phosphatidylcholine lipids ([~]50%), roughly twice as much as log-stage membranes. Moreover, in the stationary stage these lipids have higher melting temperatures, due to longer and more saturated acyl chains. Another surprise is that no significant change in sterol content is observed. These results fit within the predominant view that phase separation in membranes requires at least three types of molecules to be present: lipids with high melting temperatures, lipids with low melting temperatures, and sterols.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTWhen budding yeast shift from growth to quiescence, the membrane of one of their organelles (the vacuole) undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation. What changes in the membranes lipids cause this phase transition? Here, we conduct lipidomics of immuno-isolated vacuole membranes. We analyze our data in the context of lipid melting temperatures, inspired by observations that liquid-liquid phase separation in model membranes requires a mixture of lipids with high melting temperatures, lipids with low melting temperatures, and sterols. We find that phase-separated vacuole membranes have higher concentrations of PC lipids, and that those lipids have higher melting temperatures. To conduct our experiments, we developed a tagged version of a protein (Mam3) for immuno-isolation of vacuole membranes.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-associated transposons (CAST) are programmable mobile elements that insert large DNA cargo by an RNA-guided mechanism. Multiple conserved components act in concert at the target site through formation of an integration complex (transpososome). We reconstituted the type V-K CAST transpososome from Scytonema hofmannii (ShCAST) and determined the structure using cryo-EM. Transpososome architecture ensures orientation-specific association: AAA+ regulator TnsC has defined polarity and length, with dedicated interaction interfaces for other CAST components. Interestingly, transposase (TnsB)-TnsC interactions we observe contribute to stimulating TnsCs ATP hydrolysis activity. TnsC deviates from previously observed helical configurations of TnsC, and target DNA does not track with TnsC protomers. Consequently, TnsC makes new, functionally important protein-DNA interactions throughout the transpososome. Finally, two distinct transpososome populations suggests that associations with the CRISPR effector are flexible. These ShCAST transpososome structures significantly enhances our understanding of CAST transposition systems and suggests avenues for improving CAST transposition for precision genome-editing applications.",

    "abstract": "One of several ways MT1-MMP promotes cell migration is by modifying cell adhesion properties. MT1-MMP directly processes cell adhesion properties by shedding cell transmembrane receptors that attach cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM). The shedding leads to the destabilization and disassembly of firm cell-matrix adhesion that holds cells in their stationary position, prompting cells to migrate. In this paper, we present a multiscale mathematical model of single cell migration driven by MT1-MMP destabilization of cell-matrix adhesion. The dynamics of MT1-MMP are modeled using a system of differential equations that are integrated with the Cellular Potts Model (CPM) for a combined modeling at the intracellular and cellular scale, respectively. The CPM is extended to include a local feedback mechanism from MT1-MMP on the membrane that enhances cell membrane fluctuations, resulting in actively migrating cells. The results of computational simulation show that MT1-MMP is capable of destabilizing strong cell-matrix adhesion and stimulating cell migration, and at the same time, also producing cell polarization and motile cell morphology.",

    "abstract": "Potassium efflux via the two pore K+ channel TWIK2 is a requisite step for the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, however it is unclear how the efflux is activated in response to cues. Here we report that during homeostasis, TWIK2 resides in endosomal compartments. TWIK2 is transported by endosomal fusion to the plasmalemma in response to increased extracellular ATP resulting in extrusion of K+ ATP-induced endosomal TWIK2 plasmalemma translocation is regulated by Rab11a. Deleting Rab11a or ATP ligated purinergic receptor P2X7 prevented endosomal fusion with the plasmalemma and K+ efflux and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Adoptive transfer of Rab11a-deleted macrophages into mouse lungs prevented NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory lung injury. Rab11a-mediated endosomal trafficking in macrophages thus regulates TWIK2 abundance and activity on the cell surface and downstream activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Endosomal trafficking of TWIK2 to the plasmalemma is therefore a potential therapy target in acute or chronic inflammatory states.",

    "abstract": "Cells selectively remove damaged or excessive mitochondria through mitophagy, a specialized form of autophagy, to maintain mitochondrial quality and quantity. Mitophagy is induced in response to diverse conditions, including hypoxia, cellular differentiation, and mitochondrial damage. However, the mechanisms by which cells remove specific dysfunctional mitochondria under steady-state conditions to fine-tune mitochondrial content are not well understood. Here, we report that SCFFBXL4, an SKP1/CUL1/F-box protein ubiquitin ligase complex, localizes to the mitochondrial outer membrane in unstressed cells and mediates the constitutive ubiquitylation and degradation of the mitophagy receptors NIX and BNIP3 to suppress basal levels of mitophagy. We demonstrate that, unlike wild-type FBXL4, pathogenic variants of FBXL4 that cause encephalopathic mtDNA depletion syndrome (MTDPS13), do not efficiently interact with the core SCF ubiquitin ligase machinery or mediate the degradation of NIX and BNIP3. Thus, we reveal a molecular mechanism that actively suppresses mitophagy via preventing NIX and BNIP3 accumulation and propose that excessive basal mitophagy in the FBXL4-associated mtDNA depletion syndrome is caused by dysregulation of NIX and BNIP3 turnover.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=195 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/511867v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19c97f6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bca5a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e9419org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18d28a9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential subunits of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system, but is also a major damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that engages innate immune sensors when released into the cytoplasm, outside of cells or into circulation1. This function of mtDNA contributes to antiviral resistance, but unfortunately also causes pathogenic inflammation in many disease contexts2. Cells experiencing mtDNA stress due to depletion of the mtDNA-packaging protein, Transcription Factor A, Mitochondrial (TFAM), or HSV-1 infection exhibit elongated mitochondria, mtDNA depletion, enlargement of nucleoids (mtDNA-protein complexes), and activation of cGAS/STING innate immune signaling via mtDNA released into the cytoplasm3. However, the relationships between altered mitochondrial dynamics and mtDNA-mediated activation of the cGAS-STING pathway remain unclear. Here, we show that entire enlarged nucleoids are released from mitochondria that remain bound to TFAM and colocalize with cGAS. These nucleoids arise at sites of mtDNA replication due to a block in mitochondrial fission at a stage when endoplasmic reticulum (ER) actin polymerization would normally commence, which we propose is a fission checkpoint to ensure that mtDNA has completed replication and is competent for segregation into daughter mitochondria. Released nucleoids also colocalize with the early endosomal marker RAB5 as well as the late endosomal marker RAB7 in TFAM-deficient cells and in response to mtDNA stress caused by the HSV-1 UL12.5 protein. Loss of RAB7 increases interferon stimulated gene (ISG) expression. Thus, we propose that defects in mtDNA replication and/or segregation enact a late mitochondrial fission checkpoint that, if persistent, leads to selective removal of dysfunctional nucleoids by a mitochondrial-endosomal pathway. Early steps in this pathway are prone to mtDNA release and cGAS-STING activation, but the immunostimulatory mtDNA is ultimately disposed of through a mechanism involving RAB7-containing late endosomes to prevent excessive innate immune signaling. This mtDNA quality control pathway might represent a therapeutic target to prevent mtDNA-mediated inflammation and associated pathology.",

    "abstract": "The cohesin complex plays essential roles in chromosome segregation, 3D genome organisation, and DNA damage repair through its ability to modify DNA topology. In higher eukaryotes, meiotic chromosome function, and therefore fertility, requires cohesin complexes containing meiosis-specific kleisin subunits: REC8 and RAD21L in mammals and REC-8 and COH-3/4 in C. elegans. How these complexes perform the multiple functions of cohesin during meiosis and whether this involves different modes of DNA binding or dynamic association with chromosomes is poorly understood. Combining time-resolved methods of protein removal with live imaging and exploiting the temporospatial organisation of the C. elegans germline, we show that REC-8 complexes provide sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) and DNA repair, while COH-3/4 complexes control higher-order chromosome structure. High-abundance COH-3/4 complexes associate dynamically with individual chromatids in a manner dependent on cohesin loading (SCC-2) and removal (WAPL-1) factors. In contrast, low-abundance REC-8 complexes associate stably with chromosomes, tethering sister chromatids from S-phase until the meiotic divisions. Our results reveal that kleisin identity determines the function of meiotic cohesin by controlling the mode and regulation of cohesin-DNA association, and are consistent with a model in which SCC and DNA looping are performed by variant cohesin complexes that coexist on chromosomes.",

    "abstract": "The master kinase PAR-4/LKB1 appears as a major regulator of intestinal physiology. It is in particular mutated in the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, an inherited disorder in which patients develop benign intestine polyps. Moreover, ectopic activation of PAR-4/LKB1 is sufficient to induce the polarized accumulation of apical and basolateral surface proteins and the formation of apical microvilli-like structures in intestinal epithelial cancer cell lines. In C. elegans, PAR-4 was shown to be required for the differentiation of intestinal cells. Here, we further examine the role of PAR-4 during intestinal development. We find that it is not required for the establishment of enterocyte polarity and plays only a minor role in brush border formation. By contrast, par-4 mutants display severe deformations of the intestinal lumen as well as supernumerary intestinal cells, thereby revealing a novel function of PAR-4 in preventing intestinal hyperplasia. Importantly, we find that the ability of PAR-4 to control intestinal cell number does not involve the regulation of cell proliferation but is rather due to its ability to restrict the expression of intestinal cell fate factors to the E blastomere lineage. We therefore propose that PAR-4 is required to regulate C. elegans intestine specification.",
