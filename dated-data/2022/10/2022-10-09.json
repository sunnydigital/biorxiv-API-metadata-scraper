    "abstract": "The advent of rapid and inexpensive sequencing technologies has necessitated the development of computationally efficient methods for analyzing sequence data for many genes simultaneously in a phylogenetic framework. The coalescent process is the most commonly used model for linking the underlying genealogies of individual genes with the global species-level phylogeny, but inference under the coalescent model is computationally daunting in the typical inference frameworks (e.g., the likelihood and Bayesian frameworks) due to the dimensionality of the space of both gene trees and species trees. Here we consider estimation of the branch lengths in a fixed species tree, and show that these branch lengths are identifiable. We also show that for three and four taxa simple estimators for the branch lengths can be derived based on observed site pattern frequencies. Properties of these estimators, such as their asymptotic variances and large-sample distributions, are examined, and performance of the estimators is assessed using simulation. Finally, we use these estimators to develop a hypothesis test that can be used to delimit species under the coalescent model.",

    "abstract": "Cells form networks in animal tissues through synaptic, chemical and adhesive links. Invertebrate muscle cells often connect to other cells through desmosomes, adhesive junctions anchored by intermediate filaments. To study desmosomal networks, we skeletonised 853 muscle cells and their desmosomal partners in volume electron microscopy data covering an entire larva of the annelid Platynereis. Muscle cells adhere to each other, to epithelial, glial, ciliated, and bristle-producing cells and to the basal lamina, forming a desmosomal connectome of over 2,000 cells. The aciculae - chitin rods that form an endoskeleton in the segmental appendages - are highly connected hubs in this network. This agrees with the many degrees of freedom of their movement, as revealed by video microscopy. Mapping motoneuron synapses to the desmosomal connectome allowed us to infer the extent of tissue influenced by motoneurons. Our work shows how cellular-level maps of synaptic and adherent force networks can elucidate body mechanics.",

    "abstract": "A significant proportion of infant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients remains with a dismal prognosis due to yet undetermined mechanisms. We performed a comprehensive multicohort analysis of gene expression, gene fusions, and RNA splicing alterations to uncover molecular signatures potentially linked to the observed poor outcome. We identified 87 fusions with significant allele frequency across patients and shared functional impacts, suggesting common mechanisms across fusions. We further identified a gene expression signature that predicts high risk independently of the gene fusion background and includes the upregulation of the splicing factor SRRM1. Experiments in B-ALL cell lines provided further evidence for the role of SRRM1 on cell survival, proliferation, and invasion. Supplementary analysis revealed that SRRM1 potentially modulates splicing events associated with poor outcomes through protein-protein interactions with other splicing factors. Our findings reveal a potential convergent mechanism of aberrant RNA processing that sustains a malignant phenotype independently of the underlying gene fusion, and that could potentially complement current clinical strategies in infant B-ALL.",

In stomatous plants, a TF module formed by subfamilies Ia and IIIb basic helix-loop-helix TFs (Ia-IIIb bHLH) regulates stomatal formation; however, how this module evolved during land plant diversification remains unclear. Here, we show that, in the astomatous liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a Ia-IIIb bHLH module regulates the development of a unique sporophyte tissue, the seta, which is found in mosses and liverworts. The sole Ia bHLH gene, MpSETA, and a IIIb bHLH gene, MpICE2, regulate the cell division and/or differentiation of seta lineage cells. MpSETA can partially replace the stomatal function of Ia bHLH TFs in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that a common regulatory mechanism underlies the setal and stomatal formation. Our findings reveal the co-option of a Ia-IIIb bHLH TF module for regulating cell fate determination and/or cell division of distinct types of cells during land plant evolution.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic control of neural activity enables innovative approaches to improve functional restoration of diseased sensory and motor systems. For clinical translation to succeed, optogenetic stimulation needs to closely match the coding properties of the targeted neuronal population and employ suitable emitters at their optimal operation. This requires tailoring of channelrhodopsins, emitters and coding strategies. Here, we provide a framework to parametrize optogenetic neural control and apply it to the auditory pathway that requires high temporal fidelity of stimulation. We used viral gene transfer of the ultrafast targeting-optimized Chronos into spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) of the cochlea. We characterized the light-evoked response by in vivo recordings from individual SGNs and neurons of the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN) that detect coincident SGN input. Our results demonstrate that spike probability of SGNs can be gradually dialed by adjusting the width of light pulses of constant intensity, which optimally serves efficient laser diode operation. We identified an effective pulse width of 1.6 ms to maximize information encoding in SGNs. An upper boundary of optical stimulation rates results from robust spike rate adaptation that required a few tens of milliseconds to recover. We developed a semi-stochastic stimulation paradigm to rapidly (within minutes) estimate the transfer function from light to SGNs firing. The semi-stochastic stimulus evoked firing of different statistics allowing to approximate the time constant of neuronal integration in the AVCN. Our data pave the way to design the sound coding strategies of future optical cochlear implants.",

    "abstract": "The Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) is valuable in biological research and agriculture. Its genome sequence was published before those for other insect species. RNA-Seq data for A. mellifera have been applied in several recently published studies. Nevertheless, these data have not been prepared for use in subsequent meta-analyses. To promote A. mellifera transcriptome analysis, we constructed reference transcriptome data using the reference genome sequence and RNA-Seq data curated from about 1,000 runs of public databases. The new reference transcriptome data construct comprised 149,685 transcripts, and 194,174 protein sequences were predicted. About 50-60% of the predicted protein sequences were functionally annotated using the protein sequence data for several model and insect species. Novel candidate immune-related transcripts were searched by meta-analysis using immune response-related RNA-Seq and reference transcriptome data. Three to 20 candidate transcripts including autophagy related protein 3 were upregulated or downregulated in response to both viral and bacterial infections. The constructed reference transcriptome data may facilitate future transcriptome analyses of A. mellifera.\n\nSimple SummaryThe honeybee is an economically and ecologically essential insect species and a critical social behavior model. It is vital to honey production and pollinates. Therefore, it has been studied extensively in entomological research. The Western honeybee (Apis mellifera) is a representative species of honeybees. The reference transcriptome data are required to perform the meta-analyses using public RNA-Seq data and transcriptome analysis using newly sequenced RNA-Seq data. The reference transcriptome sequences was constructed, which consisted of 149,685 transcripts, and 194,174 predicted amino acid sequences. Half the predicted protein sequences were functionally annotated using protein sequence datasets for several model and insect species. We performed meta-analysis to search for novel immune response-related transcripts. We identified 3-20 transcripts that were upregulated or downregulated in response to both viral and bacterial infections. However, the immune-related transcripts were not included among them. Autophagy related protein 3 was downregulated by viral infections. The results suggested that autophagy was implicated in the viral immune responses, and autophagy was not regulated by the canonical immune pathways in A. mellifera. The results of the meta-analysis suggested that the reference transcriptome data could be used for transcriptome analysis in A. mellifera.",

We sequenced one genome in a bottle (GIAB) sample 70 times in different runs, and one GIAB trio in triplicate. The truth set of the GIABs was used for comparison, and performance was assessed by computation time, F1 score, precision, and recall. In the mapping and alignment step, the DRAGEN pipeline was faster than the GATK with BWA-MEM2 pipeline. DRAGEN showed systematically higher F1 score, precision, and recall values than GATK for single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and Indels in simple-to-map, complex-to-map, coding and non-coding regions. In the variant calling step, DRAGEN was fastest. In terms of accuracy, DRAGEN and DeepVariant performed similarly and both superior to GATK, with slight advantages for DRAGEN for Indels and for DeepVariant for SNVs. The DRAGEN pipeline showed the lowest Mendelian inheritance error fraction for the GIAB trios. Mapping and alignment played a key role in variant calling of WGS, with the DRAGEN outperforming GATK.",

In this paper, we evidence for the first time that the large-scale pre-trained protein language models (PPLMs) are zero-shot predictors for two clinically relevant tasks: identifying diseasecausing mutations and predicting patient survival rate. Then we benchmark a series of state-of-the-art (SOTA) PPLMs on 2279 protein variants across 20 cancer-related genes. Our empirical results show that the PPLMs outperform the SOTA baseline, EVE [1], trained on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data. We also demonstrate that the evolutionary index score, generated from the PPLMs softmax layer, is good indicator for both mutation pathogenicity and patient survival rate. Our paper has taken a key step toward the clinical utility of large-scale PPLMs.",

    "abstract": "Cell fate decisions are driven by lineage-restricted transcription factors but how they are regulated is incompletely understood. The C/EBP-induced B cell to macrophage transdifferentiation (BMT) is a powerful system to address this question. Here we describe that C/EBP with a single arginine mutation (C/EBPR35A) induces a dramatically accelerated BMT in mouse and human cells. Changes in the expression of lineage-restricted genes occur as early as within 1 hour compared to 18 hours with the wild type. Mechanistically C/EBPR35A exhibits an increased affinity for PU.1, a bi-lineage transcription factor required for C/EBP-induced BMT. The complex induces more rapid chromatin accessibility changes and an enhanced relocation (stealing) of PU.1 from B cell to myeloid gene regulatory elements. Arginine 35 is methylated by Carm1 and inhibition of the enzyme accelerates BMT, similar to the mutant. Our data suggest that the relative proportions of methylated and unmethylated C/EBP in a bipotent progenitor can determine the velocity of cell fate choice and lineage directionality.",

    "abstract": "Development of the C. elegans reproductive tract is orchestrated by the anchor cell (AC). Among other things, this occurs through a cell invasion event that connects the uterine and vulval tissue. Several key transcription factors regulate AC invasion, such as EGL-43, HLH-2, and NHR-67. Specifically, these transcription factors function together to maintain the post-mitotic state of the AC, a requirement for AC invasion. EGL-43 is the C. elegans homolog of the human EVI1/MECOM proto-oncogene, and recently, a mechanistic connection has been made between its loss and AC cell-cycle entry. The current model states that EGL-43 represses LIN-12 (Notch) expression to prevent AC proliferation, suggesting that Notch signaling is mitogenic in the absence of EGL-43. To reevaluate the relationship between EGL-43 and LIN-12, we designed and implemented a heterologous co-expression system called AIDHB that combines the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system of plants with a live cell-cycle sensor based on human DNA helicase B (DHB). After validating the AIDHB approach using AID-tagged GFP, we sought to test this approach using AID-tagged alleles of egl-43 and lin-12. Auxin-inducible degradation of either EGL-43 or LIN-12 resulted in the expected AC phenotypes. Lastly, we seized the opportunity to pair AIDHB with RNAi to co-deplete LIN-12 and EGL-43, respectively. This combined approach revealed that LIN-12 is not required for AC proliferation following loss of EGL-43, which contrasts with a double RNAi experiment directed against these same targets. The addition of AIDHB to the C. elegans transgenic toolkit should facilitate functional in vivo imaging of cell-cycle associated phenomena.",

    "abstract": "Regardless of whether one considers swarming insects, flocking birds, or bacterial colonies, collective motion arises from the coordination of individuals and entails the adjustment of their respective velocities. In particular, in close confinement, such as those encountered by dense cell populations during development or regeneration, collective migration can only arise coordinately. Yet, how individuals unify their velocities is often not understood. Focusing on a finite number of cells in circular confinements, we identify waves of polymerizing actin that function as a pacemaker governing the speed of individual cells. We show that the onset of collective motion coincides with the synchronization of the wave nucleation frequencies across the population. Employing a simpler and more readily accessible mechanical model system of active spheres, we identify the essential requirements to reach the corresponding collective state, i.e. the synchronization of the individuals internal oscillators. The mechanical  toy experiment illustrates that the global synchronous state is achieved by nearest neighbor coupling. We suggest by analogy that local coupling and the synchronization of actin waves are essential for emergent, self-organized motion of cell collectives.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial genomes are highly dynamic entities, mostly due to the extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) occurring in these organisms. HGT is thought to be the main driver of genetic variation and adaptation to local environment in bacteria. However, little is known about the modalities of HGT within natural microbial communities, especially the implications of genetic exchange for streamlined microorganisms such as Patescibacteria (Candidate Phyla Radiation). We searched for evidence of genetic exchange in 125 Patescibacteria genomes recovered from aquifer environments and detected the presence of hundreds of genomic islands, individually transferred genes and prophage combined, with up to 29% of genome length attributed to HGT. Results show that most individual gene transfer events occurred between Patescibacteria, but donors were also phylogenetically diverse groundwater microorganisms. Using gene donor-recipient information, we identified one potential host (Omnitrophota) of the ultra-small bacteria, and confirmed this by matching relative abundance patterns across 16 groundwater samples. A wide variety of metabolic functions were introduced in Patescibacteria genomes by HGT including transcription, translation and DNA replication, recombination and repair. This study illustrates the evolutionarily dynamic nature of Patescibacteria genomes despite the constraints of streamlining, and that HGT in these organisms is also mediated via viral infection.",

    "abstract": "Follicle-stimulation hormone (FSH) and FSH receptor (FSHR) signaling is essential for lifelong ovarian and endocrine functions in females. Previous studies have reported that Fshr haploinsufficiency in female mice led to accelerated ovarian aging, including anticipated progressive fertility decline, irregular estrus cycles, increased follicular atresia and premature ovarian failure at 7 to 9 months of age. Interestingly, these phenotypes resemble key characteristics of human menopause and thus Fshr haploinsufficiency was proposed as a promising research mouse model of menopause. However, the Fshr haploinsufficiency model had not been fully explored, especially at the molecular level. In this study, we characterized the ovarian and endocrine functions of a Fshr heterozygous knockout allele that was generated on the C57BL/6 genetic background as part of the Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP). Based on our analyses of these mice using a breeding assay, ovarian tissue histology and serum hormone quantifications (i.e. FSH, AMH, INHA) analyses, the KOMP Fshr heterozygous knockout female mice do not show the anticipated phenotypes of ovarian aging in terms of fertility and endocrine function. We further confirmed that the expression of Fshr is unaltered in the ovaries of the KOMP Fshr heterozygous knockout animals compared to wild-type. Together, our data suggests that the KOMP Fshr heterozygous knockout strain does not recapitulate the previously reported ovarian aging phenotypes associated to another model of Fshr haploinsufficiency.",

    "abstract": "Intraneuronal chloride concentrations ([Cl-]i) decrease during development resulting in a shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing y-aminobutyric acid (GABA) responses via chloride-permeable GABAA receptors. This GABA shift plays a pivotal role in postnatal brain development, and can be strongly influenced by early life experience. Here, we assessed the applicability of the recently developed fluorescent SuperClomeleon (SClm) sensor to examine changes in [Cl-]i using two-photon microscopy in brain slices. We used SClm mice of both sexes to monitor the developmental decrease in neuronal chloride levels in organotypic hippocampal cultures. We could discern a clear reduction in [Cl-]i between DIV3 and DIV9 (equivalent to the second postnatal week in vivo) and a further decrease in some cells until DIV22. In addition, we assessed alterations in [Cl-]i in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of P9 male SClm mouse pups after early life stress (ELS). ELS was induced by limiting nesting material between P2 and P9. ELS induced a shift towards higher (i.e. immature) chloride levels in layer 2/3 cells in the mPFC. Although conversion from SClm fluorescence to absolute chloride concentrations proved difficult, our study underscores that the SClm sensor is a powerful tool to measure physiological changes in [Cl-]i in brain slices.\n\nSignificance StatementThe reduction of intraneuronal chloride concentrations is crucial for brain development, as it ensures a shift from the initial excitatory action of the neurotransmitter GABA in immature neurons to the inhibitory GABA signaling in the adult brain. Despite the significance of chloride maturation, it has been difficult to study this phenomenon in experiments. Recent development of chloride sensors enable direct imaging of intracellular chloride signaling in neurons. Here we assessed the applicability of the SuperClomeleon chloride sensor to measure physiologically relevant changes in chloride levels using two-photon microscopy in cultured and acute brain slices. Although we also point out some limitations, we conclude that the SuperClomeleon sensor is a powerful tool to measure physiological changes in intracellular chloride.",

    "abstract": "Climate change will have a net negative and inequitable impact on agriculture. Genetics for crop improvement ranks in the top set of technologies that can contribute to human adaptation to climate change. However, a framework for how to breed crops for climate change adaptation is lacking. Here we propose a framework to develop new genotype (G) x management (M) technologies (G x M) to adapt to climate change, and to transition from current to future G x M technologies in a way that future food security does not come at the expense of current food security. The framework integrate genomic, agronomic, and environmental (E) predictors to accomplish two critical goals: 1-predict emergent phenotypes that stems from the dynamic interplay between G, E and M, and thus enable the breeder to consider the behavior of new genetic and trait combinations in environments that plants have not been exposed or tested before, and 2-identify G x M technologies that could increase food and nutritional security while regenerating natural and production resources. We highlight the need to invest in artificial intelligence and information technologies for breeders to harness multiple sources of information to create G x M technologies to address the diverse cultural and geographically granular societal needs.",

Adopting a dynamical system framework, we investigate the presence of frequency-specific and network-level selectivity and combine it with a statistical approach in which a clear distinction is made between shared, preferred, and category-selective neural responses. Using intracranial EEG recordings in 18 epilepsy patients listening to natural and continuous speech and music, we show that the majority of focal and network-level neural activity is shared between speech and music processing. Our data also reveal an absence of regional selectivity. Instead, neural selectivity is restricted to distributed and frequency-specific coherent oscillations, typical of spectral fingerprints.

Holistic characterization of such mechanisms requires integrating patterns of variability across scales. Here, we integrated observational, experimental, and theoretical approaches to unify local and regional ecological processes driving the dynamics of benthic cyanobacterial mats on coral reefs off the island of Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. Community and metacommunity dynamics of mats were tracked for 49 days alongside quantification of macropredation pressure from fishes. We tested the hypothesis that enhanced predation would result in decreased mat persistence in situ. Finally, we constructed a cellular automaton model to predict patterns in mat metacommunity dynamics across different scenarios of top-down and bottom-up control and dispersal. Cyanobacterial mat metacommunities were temporally stable across the study, stabilized by asynchrony in the dynamics of communities. Diverse reef fishes foraged on mats in situ and experimental increases in predation pressure decreased the instantaneous mortality rate of mat communities over mat communities experiencing natural levels of predation pressure. Theoretical simulations suggested that dispersal conveys a rescuing effect on mat metacommunity abundance under scenarios of strong trophic control.",

Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) resident in the marrow niche experience a diverse mechanical environment, but ageing can affect the composition and quality of bone and marrow tissues. Here we quantified the effect of replication-induced senescence on MSC morphology and their ability to correctly respond to different substrate stiffnesses. The matrix proteome was found to be sensitive to substrate stiffness, but pharmacological inhibition of cellular contractility perturbed this response, decreasing levels of tenascin-C, fibulins and fibronectin. Similar decreases in these mechanosensitive proteins were observed in senescent cells, suggested a decoupling of mechanotransduction pathways. Intracellular proteomic and transcriptomic analyses confirmed a decrease in components of the cytoskeletal chaperone complex CCT/TRiC in senescent MSCs. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of CCT/TRiC was able to partially recapitulate senescence-associated morphological changes in non-senescent MSCs. These results demonstrate a senescence-mediated perturbation to cytoskeletal homeostasis, pathways of mechanotransduction and the secretion of matrix proteins required for tissue maintenance.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand break (DSB) is a serious form of DNA damage that can cause genetic mutation. On the induction of DSBs, histone H2AX becomes phosphorylated by kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR), and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK). Phosphorylated H2AX ({gamma}-H2AX) can be a platform to recruit DNA repair machinery. Here we analyzed the immediate early kinetics of {gamma}-H2AX upon laser-induced DNA damage in ATM-proficient and -deficient living cells by using fluorescently labeled antigen-binding fragments specific for {gamma}-H2AX. The accumulation kinetics of {gamma}-H2AX were similar in both ATM-proficient and -deficient cells. However, {gamma}-H2AX accumulation was delayed when the cells were treated with a DNA-PK inhibitor, suggesting that DNA-PK rapidly phosphorylates H2AX at DSB sites. Ku80, a DNA-PK subunit, diffused freely in the nucleus without DNA damage, whereas ATM repeatedly bound to and dissociated from chromatin. The H2AX phosphorylation activity of ATM, but not DNA-PK, depended on a histone H4K16 acetyltransferase, males absent on the first (MOF). These results suggest distinct actions of ATM and DNA-PK that plays a primary role in immediate early {gamma}-H2AX accumulation.",

    "abstract": "Skeletal muscle exhibits remarkable plasticity in response to environmental cues, with stress-dependent effects on the fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers. Although stress-induced gene expression underlies environmental adaptation, it is unclear how transcriptional and epigenetic factors regulate fiber type-specific responses in the muscle. Here, we show that flavin-dependent lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) differentially controls responses to glucocorticoid and exercise in postnatal skeletal muscle. Using skeletal muscle-specific LSD1 knockout mice and in vitro approaches, we found that LSD1 loss exacerbated glucocorticoid-induced atrophy in the fast fiber-dominant muscles, with reduced nuclear retention of Foxk1, an anti-autophagic transcription factor. Furthermore, LSD1 depletion enhanced endurance exercise-induced hypertrophy in the slow fiber-dominant muscles, by induced expression of ERR{gamma}, a transcription factor that promotes oxidative metabolism genes. Thus, LSD1 serves as an \"epigenetic barrier\" that optimizes fiber type-specific responses and muscle mass under the stress conditions. Our results uncover that LSD1 modulators provide emerging therapeutic and preventive strategies against stress-induced myopathies such as sarcopenia, cachexia, and disuse atrophy.\n\nGraphical abstract.

    "abstract": "2,4-di-tert-butylphenol (2,4-DTBP) is an important commercial antioxidant and a toxic natural secondary metabolite that has been detected in humans. However, there is scant information regarding its toxicological effects. Here we asked whether 2,4-DTBP is a potential obesogen. Using a human mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) adipogenesis assay, we found that exposure to 2,4-DTBP led to increased lipid accumulation and expression of adipogenic marker genes. Antagonist assays revealed that 2,4-DTBP increased lipid accumulation by activating the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor {gamma} (PPAR{gamma})-retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer. 2,4-DTBP likely activated the PPAR{gamma}/RXR heterodimer by activating RXR but not directly binding to PPAR{gamma}. We confirmed that 2,4-DTBP directly bound to RXR by solving the crystal structure of this complex, then predicted and demonstrated that related compounds could also activate RXR. Our study demonstrated that 2,4-DTBP and related chemicals could act as obesogens and endocrine disruptors via RXR. These data showed that 2,4-DTBP belongs to a family of compounds whose endocrine-disrupting and obesogenic effects can be strongly modulated by their chemical composition and that structure-activity studies such as the present one could help guide the rational development of safer antioxidants.\n\nSYNOPSISLittle research exists on the effects of commercially valuable antioxidants on biological systems. This study reports that di- and tri-tert-butylphenols can act as endocrine disruptors and potential obesogens by activating nuclear hormone receptors.",

We fused chromosome 15 and 17 in mouse haploid embryonic stem cells (haESCs), resulting in distinct changes of territories in the corresponding native chromosomes, but affecting little on gene expression, pluripotency and gamete functions of haESCs. The karyotype engineered haESCs were successfully implemented in cultivating heterozygous (2n=39) and homozygous (2n=38) mouse models. The mice containing fusion-chromosome are fertile, and their representative tissues and organs display no phenotypic abnormalities, suggesting mouse development unscathed. These results indicate that the mammalian chromosome architectures are highly resilient, and reorganization of chromosome territories can be readily tolerated during cell differentiation and mouse development.",

Using an in vitro ASCL1 knockout model we show it drives progenitor differentiation by cis-regulation both as a classical pioneer factor and as a non-pioneer remodeler, where ASCL1 binds permissive chromatin to induce chromatin conformation changes. We find ASCL1 directly interacts with mammalian BAF SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes, essential for neurogenesis and involved in multiple neurodevelopmental disorders. ASCL1 acts as a non-pioneer chromatin remodeler to regulate gene expression at a subset of loci, requiring mBAF SWI/SNFs ATPase activity for cis-regulation of gene expression. Our findings demonstrate that ASCL1 is a key chromatin remodeler in human neurogenesis, uncovering an alternative mechanism of remodeling function dependent on partner ATPase activity.",

However, the link between genetic diversity and DNAme has been scarcely examined in natural populations, despite its potential to shed light on the evolutionary forces acting on methylation state. Here, we analysed reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing and whole genome pool-seq data from marine and freshwater stickleback populations to examine the relationship between DNAme variation (between- and within-population), and nucleotide diversity in the context of freshwater adaptation. We find that sites that are differentially methylated between populations have higher underlying standing genetic variation, with diversity higher among sites that gained methylation in freshwater than those that lost it. Strikingly, while nucleotide diversity is generally lower in the freshwater population as expected from a population bottleneck, this is not the case for sites which lost methylation which instead have elevated nucleotide diversity in freshwater compared to marine. Subsequently, we show that nucleotide diversity is higher among sites with ancestrally variable methylation and also positively correlates with the sensitivity to environmentally induced methylation change. Both suggest that as selection on the control of methylation state becomes relaxed, so too does selection against mutations at the sites themselves. Increased epigenetic variance in a population is therefore likely to precede genetic diversification.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation at CpG dinucleotides is a hallmark of cancer and is associated with the emergence of resistance to anti cancer treatment, though molecular mechanisms and biological significance remain elusive. Genome scale methylation maps by currently used methods are based on chemical modification of DNA and are best suited for analyses of methylation at CpG rich regions (CpG islands). We report the first high coverage whole genome map in cancer using the long read nanopore technology, which allows simultaneous DNA-sequence and -methylation analyses on native DNA. We analyzed clonal epigenomic/genomic evolution in Acute Myeloid Leukemias (AMLs) at diagnosis and relapse, after chemotherapy. Long read sequencing coupled to a novel computational method allowed definition of differential methylation at unprecedented resolution, and showed that the relapse methylome is characterized by hypermethylation at both CpG islands and sparse CpGs regions. Most differentially methylated genes, however, were not differentially expressed nor enriched for chemoresistance genes. A small fraction of under-expressed and hyper-methylated genes at sparse CpGs, in the gene body, was significantly enriched in transcription factors (TFs). Remarkably, these few TFs supported large gene-regulatory networks including 50% of all differentially expressed genes in the relapsed AMLs and highly-enriched in chemoresistance genes. Notably, hypermethylated regions at sparse CpGs were poorly conserved in the relapsed AMLs, under-represented at their genomic positions and showed higher methylation entropy, as compared to CpG islands. Relapsed AMLs carried few patient specific structural variants and DNA mutations, apparently not involved in drug resistance. Thus, drug resistance in AMLs can be mainly ascribed to the selection of random epigenetic alterations at sparse CpGs of a few transcription factors, which then induce reprogramming of the relapsing phenotype, independently of clonal genomic evolution.",

One rapid adaptation mechanism that promotes plasticity is epigenetic memory, which may provide long-lived organisms the precious time needed to adapt to climate change. In this study, we used the perennial plant Fragaria vesca as a model to determine how the methylome and transcriptome adapt to elevated temperatures (28 vs. 18 {degrees}C) over three asexual generations. Changes in flowering time, stolon number, and petiole length were induced in responses to temperature treatment in one or more ecotypes after three asexual generations in a manner indicative of an epigenetic memory. Induced methylome changes differed between four different ecotypes from Norway, Iceland, Italy, and Spain, but there were also some shared responses. Elevated temperature conditions induced significant phenotypic and methylation changes, particularly in the Norwegian ecotype. Most of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were in the CHG context, and most CHG and CHH DMRs were hypermethylated. Notably, the four ecotypes shared only eight CHG DMR peaks. Several differentially methylated genes (DMGs) also showed a change in gene expression. Ecotype-specific methylation and expression patterns were observed for genes related to gibberellin metabolism, flowering time, epigenetics. Furthermore, when repetitive elements (REs) were found near ({+/-}2 kb) or inside a gene, they showed a negative correlation with gene expression. In conclusion, phenotypic changes induced by elevated temperatures during asexual reproduction were accompanied by changes in DNA methylation patterns. Also, positional influences of REs impacted gene expression, indicating that DNA methylation may be involved in both general and ecotype-specific phenotypic plasticity in F. vesca.",

    "abstract": "Much of the profound interspecific variation in genome content has been attributed to transposable elements (TEs). To explore the extent of TE variation within species, we developed an optimized open-source algorithm, panEDTA, to de novo annotate TEs in a pan-genome context. We then generated a unified TE annotation for a maize pan-genome derived from 26 reference-quality genomes, which revealed an excess of 35.1 Mb of TE sequences per genome in tropical maize relative to temperate maize. A small number (n = 216) of TE families, mainly LTR retrotransposons, drive these differences. Evidence from the methylome, transcriptome, LTR age distribution, and LTR insertional polymorphisms revealed that 64.7% of the variability was contributed by LTR families that were young, less methylated, and more expressed in tropical maize, while 18.5% was driven by LTR families with removal or loss in temperate maize. This study demonstrates the use of a comprehensive pan-TE annotation to reveal the driving role of TEs in within-species genomic variation via their ongoing amplification and purging.",

    "abstract": "Breast cancer is a leading cause of global cancer-related deaths, and metastasis is the overwhelming culprit of poor patient prognosis. The most nefarious aspect of metastasis is dormancy, a prolonged period between primary tumor resection and relapse. Current therapies are insufficient at killing dormant cells; thus, they can remain quiescent in the body for decades until eventually undergoing a phenotypic switch, resulting in metastases that are more adaptable and more drug resistant. Unfortunately, dormancy has few in vitro models, largely because lab-derived cell lines are highly proliferative. Existing models address tumor dormancy, not cellular dormancy, because tracking individual cells is technically challenging. To combat this problem, we adapted a live cell lineage approach to find and track individual dormant cells, distinguishing them from proliferative and dying cells over multiple days. We applied this approach across a range of different in vitro microenvironments. Our approach revealed that the proportion of cells that exhibited long-term quiescence was regulated by both cell intrinsic and extrinsic factors, with the most dormant cells found in 3D collagen gels. We hope this approach will prove useful to biologists and bioengineers in the dormancy community to identify, quantify, and study dormant tumor cells.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=173 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/511405v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (52K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5d0af9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7b7830org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f9fc4org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c20a39_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Most proteins found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria share a common domain: the transmembrane {beta}-barrel. These outer membrane {beta}-barrels (OMBBs) occur in multiple sizes, and different families with a wide range of functions evolved independently by amplification from a pool of homologous ancestral {beta}{beta}-hairpins. This is part of the reason why predicting their three-dimensional (3D) structure, especially by homology modeling, is a major challenge. Recently, DeepMinds AlphaFold v2 (AF2) became the first structure prediction method to reach close-to-experimental atomic accuracy in CASP even for difficult targets. However, membrane proteins, especially OMBBs, were not abundant during its training, raising the question of how accurate the predictions are for these families. In this study, we assessed the performance of AF2 in the prediction of OMBBs of various topologies using an in-house-developed tool for the analysis of OMBB 3D structures, barrOs. In agreement with previous studies on other membrane protein classes, our results indicate that AF2 predicts OMBB structures at high accuracy independently of the use of templates, even for novel topologies absent from the training set. These results provide confidence on the models generated by AF2 and open the door to the structural elucidation of novel OMBB topologies identified in high-throughput OMBB annotation studies.",

    "abstract": "The rapid development of single cell transcriptomics has revolutionized the study of complex tissues. Single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) can profile tens-of-thousands of dissociated cells from a tissue sample, enabling researchers to identify cell types, phenotypes and interactions that control tissue structure and function. A key requirement of these applications is the accurate estimation of cell surface protein abundance. Although technologies to directly quantify surface proteins are available, this data is uncommon and limited to proteins with available antibodies. While supervised methods that are trained on Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-seq) data can provide the best performance, this training data is also limited by available antibodies and may not exist for the tissue under investigation. In the absence of protein measurements, researchers must estimate receptor abundance from scRNA-seq data. We thereby developed a new unsupervised method for receptor abundance estimation using scRNA-seq data called SPECK (Surface Protein abundance Estimation using CKmeans-based clustered thresholding) and evaluated its performance against other unsupervised approaches on up to 215 human receptors and multiple tissue types. This analysis reveals that techniques based on a thresholded reduced rank reconstruction (RRR) of scRNA-seq data are effective for receptor abundance estimation with SPECK providing the best overall performance.",

Grid cells in the entorhinal cortex are a central component of self-related navigation but whether they also track others movement is unclear. Here, we propose that entorhinal grid-like codes make an essential contribution to socio-spatial navigation. Sixty human participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while observing and re-tracing different paths of a demonstrator that navigated a virtual reality environment. Results revealed that grid-like codes in the entorhinal cortex tracked the other individual navigating through space. Further, the activity of grid-like codes was time-locked to increases in co-activation and entorhinal-cortical connectivity that included the striatum, the hippocampus, parahippocampal and right posterior parietal cortices, altogether modulated by accuracy when subsequently re-tracing the paths. This suggests that network dynamics time-locked to entorhinal grid-cell-related activity might serve to distribute information about the  socio-spatial map throughout the brain.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamus is a central structure of the mammalian brain, which controls physiological, endocrine and metabolic brain homeostasis. Despite this essential role, little is known about the normal and altered neurochemical changes occurring within the hypothalamic structures. Here, the metabolism of the hypothalamus of ewes was investigated at 3T using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS). We used the sensitivity of these animals to photoperiod i.e. the ratio of day to night length, to investigate the hypothalamic metabolic changes and their relationship to hypothalamic adult neurogenesis. A longitudinal study involving 4 ewes per timepoint was conducted at 4 time points (P01, P02, P03 and P04) during long days (LD) and 4 time points during short days (SD). Significant metabolic changes were found between LD and SD at all time points in particular for glutamate (Glu), glutamine, myo-inositol and total N-acetyl-Aspartate (NAA). During SD, glutamate and glutamine concentrations were significantly smaller at P01 compared to all other time points while significant neurochemical changes occurred during the entire LD period. Neurochemical changes relative to P01 remained stable during LD and SD except for Glu and Gln which increased between P01 and P02 during SD. Relative metabolic changes were significantly higher on average for NAA and Glu and significantly smaller on average for total choline during SD compared to LD, respectively, paralleling the average changes in the numbers of neural stem cells and glial and oligodendrocyte progenitors found by immunohistochemistry. Despite important differences between MRS and immunohistochemistry in terms of spatial resolution, both techniques suggest complementary findings that should contribute to a better characterization of the hypothalamus during photoperiodism and adult neurogenesis. We conclude that 1H-MRS could be a promising non-invasive translational technique to investigate the existence of adult neurogenesis in-vivo in gyrencephalic brains.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expanded ([&ge;]40) glutamine-encoding CAG repeats in the huntingtin gene, which leads to dysfunction and death of predominantly striatal and cortical neurons. While the genetic profile and behavioural signs of the disease are better known, changes in the functional architecture of the brain, especially before the behavioural symptoms become apparent, are not fully and consistently characterized. In this study, we sought markers at pre, early and late manifest states of phenotypic progression in the heterozygous (HET) zQ175 delta-neo (DN) mouse model, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI). This mouse model shows molecular, cellular and circuitry alterations that resemble those seen in HD in humans. Specifically, we investigated, longitudinally, changes in co-activation patterns (CAPs) that are the transient states of brain activity constituting the resting-state networks (RSNs). Most robust changes in the temporal properties of CAPs occurred at the late manifest state; the durations of two anti-correlated CAPs, characterized by simultaneous co-activation of default-mode like network (DMLN) and co-deactivation of lateral-cortical network (LCN) and vice-versa, were reduced in the zQ175 DN HET animals compared to the wild-type mice. Changes in the spatial properties, measured in terms of activation levels of different brain regions, during CAPs were found at all three states and became progressively more pronounced at the manifest states. We then assessed the cross-validated predictive power of CAP metrics to distinguish HET animals from controls. Spatial properties of CAPs performed significantly better than the chance level at all three states with 80% classification accuracy at the early and late manifest states.",

    "abstract": "Archipelago island fauna include some of the most compelling examples of parallel adaptation to ecological gradients. However, despite the insuslar nature of these systems, the possibility that repeated instances of within-island divergence resulted from independent (in situ) evolutionary rather than repeated colonization events remains most often unclear. Here, we investigated the genomic underpinning of a progressive adaptive radiation of caterpillar-hunter beetles (Calosoma) in the low- and highland habitats from the Galapagos. These Calosoma beetles have evolved only partially reduced wings in the highland of the youngest islands but evolved to distinct short-winged species in the highland of the oldest islands. In support of independent evolutionary events, the extent of genome-wide divergence between long-winged lowland and short-winged highland populations decreased towards younger islands. However, in support of repeated colonization events, adaptation to highland habitats was driven by repeated selection of alleles that are shared across all highland species and populations. These alleles comprised extensive chromosomal inversions whose origin was traced back to an initial high-lowland divergence event on the oldest island. Moreover, we found evidence that after this initial divergence event, highland alleles spread to younger islands through dispersal of highland individuals as well as dispersal of lowland individuals that were polymorphic at adaptive loci, both providing the opportunity for the establishment of highland populations on the younger islands. These findings highlight the importance of an old divergence in driving repeated adaptation to ecological gradients. Complex histories of colonization and introgression may thus result in a mixed contribution of inter-island dispersal and within-island evolution in shaping parallel species communities on islands.",

However, differences in the uterine microbiome are yet to be investigated. The present study was aimed at evaluating the differences in uterine microbiome between healthy mares and mares with endometritis. Low-volume lavage (LVL) samples were collected from the uterus of 30 mares classified into healthy (n=15) and endometritis (n=15) based on their reproductive history, intrauterine fluid accumulation, gross appearance of LVL samples, endometrial cytology, and bacterial culture. The samples were subjected to metagenomic analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing. Notable differences in the uterine microbiome were observed between healthy mares and mares with endometritis at various taxonomic levels. In healthy mares, the most abundant phylum, class, order, and family were Firmicutes, Bacilli, Bacillales, and Paenibacillaceae, respectively. In contrast, the most abundant corresponding taxonomic levels in mares with endometritis were Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, Enterobacterales, and Enterobacteriaceae, respectively. At the genus level, Brevibacillus and Paenibacillus were more abundant in healthy mares, whereas Escherichia, Salmonella, and Klebsiella were more abundant in mares with endometritis. In healthy mares, Brevibacillus brevis was the most abundant species, followed by Brevibacillus choshinensis and Paenibacillus sp JDR-2. However, in mares with endometritis, Escherichia coli was the most abundant species, followed by Salmonella enterica and Klebsiella pneumoniae. These results indicate novel differences in the uterine microbiome between healthy mares and mares with endometritis. The findings can potentially help formulate new approaches to prevent or treat equine endometritis.",

    "abstract": "Nanopores are one of the most successful label-free single-molecule techniques with several sensing applications such as biological screening, diagnostics, DNA and protein sequencing1-4. In current nanopore technologies, stochastic processes influence both the selection of the translocating molecule, translocation rate and translocation velocity5,6. As a result, single-molecule translocations are difficult to control spatially and temporally. Here we present a novel method where we engineer precise spatial and temporal control into the single-molecule experiment. We use a glass nanopore mounted on a 3D nanopositioner to spatially select molecules, deterministically tethered on a glass surface, for controlled translocations. By controlling the distance between the nanopore and the glass surface, we can actively select the region of interest on the molecule and scan it a controlled number of times and at controlled velocity. Decreasing the velocity and averaging thousands of consecutive readings of the same molecule increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by two orders of magnitude compared to free translocations. We applied our method to various DNA constructs, achieving down to single nucleotide gap resolution. The spatial multiplexing combined with the sub-nanometer resolution could be used in conjunction with micro-array technologies to enable screening of DNA, improving point of care devices, or enabling high-density, addressable DNA data storage.",

    "abstract": "Dioecy, a sexual system of single-sex (gynoecious/androecious) individuals, is rare in flowering plants. This rarity may be a result of the frequent transition from dioecy into systems with co-sex individuals. Here, we report potential molecular and genetic mechanisms that underlie the dissolution of dioecy to monoecy and andro(gyno)monoecy, based on multiscale genome-wide investigations of 150 accessions of Diospyros oleifera. All co-sex D. oleifera plants, including monoecious and andro(gyno)monoecious individuals, possessed the male determinant gene OGI, implying that genetic factors control gynoecia development in genetically male D. oleifera. In both single- and co-sex plants, female function was expressed in the presence of a genome-wide decrease in methylation levels, along with sexually distinct regulatory networks of smRNAs and their targets. Furthermore, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified a genomic region and a DUF247 gene cluster strongly associated with the monoecious phenotype, as well as several regions that may contribute to andromonoecy. Collectively, our findings imply stable breakdown of the dioecious system in D. oleifera, presumably a result of the genomic features of the sex-linked region.",

    "abstract": "Resilience to Alzheimers disease (RAD) is an uncommon combination of high disease burden without dementia that may provide critical insights into limiting the clinical impact of this incurable disease. In this study, we used mass spectrometry-based proteomics to quantify regional protein differences that characterize RAD. Starting with over 700 brain donations, we identified 43 extensively annotated research participants who met stringent inclusion exclusion criteria and analyzed matched isocortical regions, hippocampus, and caudate nucleus. Differential expression analysis of 7,115 soluble proteins identified lower isocortical and hippocampal soluble A{beta} peptide levels as a significant feature of RAD. Protein co-expression analysis revealed a group of 181 densely-interacting proteins significantly associated with RAD that were enriched for actin filament-based process, cellular detoxification, and wound healing in isocortex and hippocampus. We further support our findings using data from 689 human isocortical samples from four independent external cohorts that were the closest approximations of our clinico-pathologic groups. The molecular basis of RAD, a widely replicated state in older adults for which there is no experimental model, likely holds important insights into therapeutic interventions for Alzheimers disease.",

    "abstract": "Glaucoma is an age-related neurodegenerative disease of the visual system, affecting both the eye and the brain. Yet its underlying metabolic mechanisms and neurobehavioral relevance remain largely unclear. Here, using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the GABAergic and glutamatergic systems in the visual cortex of glaucoma patients, as well as neural specificity, which is shaped by GABA and glutamate signals and underlies efficient sensory and cognitive functions. Our study showed that among the older adults, both GABA and glutamate levels decrease with increasing glaucoma severity regardless of age. Further, the reduction of GABA but not glutamate predicted the neural specificity. This association was independent of the impairments on the retina structure and age. Our results suggest that glaucoma-specific decline of GABA undermines neural specificity in the visual cortex and that targeting GABA could improve the neural specificity in glaucoma.",

    "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is typically characterized by highly synchronized episodes of neural activity. Existing stimulation therapies focus purely on suppressing the pathologically synchronized neuronal firing patterns during the ictal (seizure) period. While these strategies are effective in suppressing seizures when they occur, they fail to prevent the re-emergence of seizures once the stimulation is turned off. Previously, we developed a novel neurostimulation motif, which we refer to as \"Forced Temporal Spike-Time Stimulation\" (FTSTS) [1] that has shown remarkable promise in long-lasting desynchronization of excessively synchronized neuronal firing patterns by harnessing synaptic plasticity. In this paper, we build upon this prior work [1] by optimizing the parameters of the FTSTS protocol in order to efficiently desynchronize the pathologically synchronous neuronal firing patterns that occur during epileptic seizures using a recently published computational model of neocortical-onset seizures [2]. We show that the FTSTS protocol applied during the ictal period can modify the excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic weight in order to effectively desynchronize the pathological neuronal firing patterns even after the ictal period. Our investigation opens the door to a possible new neurostimulation therapy for epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Non-invasive recordings of motor unit (MU) spike trains help us understand how the nervous system controls movement and how it adapts to various physiological conditions. The majority of study participants in human and non-human animal physiology studies are male, and it is assumed mechanisms uncovered in these studies are shared between males and females. However, sex differences in neurological impairment and physical performance warrant the study of sex as a biological variable in human physiology and performance. To begin addressing this gap in the study of biophysical properties of human motoneurons, we quantified MU discharge rates and estimates of persistent inward current (PIC) magnitude in both sexes by quantifying {Delta}F. We decomposed MU spike trains from the tibialis anterior (TA), medial gastrocnemius (MG), and soleus (SOL) using high-density surface electromyography and blind source separation algorithms. Ten participants of each sex performed slow triangular (10s up and down) isometric contractions to a peak of 30% of their maximum voluntary contraction. We then used linear mixed effects models to determine if peak discharge rate and {Delta}F were predicted by the fixed effects of sex, muscle, and their interaction. Despite a lack of significant sex-differences in peak discharge rates across all muscles, {Delta}F was larger ({chi}2(1) = 6.26, p = 0.012) in females (4.73 {+/-} 0.242 pps) than males (3.81 {+/-} 0.240 pps). These findings suggest that neuromodulatory drive, inhibitory input, and/or biophysical properties of motoneurons differ between the sexes and may contribute to differences in MU discharge patterns.\n\nKEY POINTS- Sex differences in motor unit studies have been revealed with greater inclusion of female participants, however, mechanisms for these differences remain unclear.\n- Estimates of persistent inward currents (i.e., {Delta}F) were greater in females than males in the tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, and soleus muscles.\n- This suggests that neuromodulatory drive, monoaminergic signaling, or descending control may differ between the sexes.\n- Therefore, sex differences in estimates of PICs may provide a mechanism behind previously reported sex differences in motoneuron discharge patterns..",

    "abstract": "Zebrafish robustly regenerate fins, including their characteristic bony ray skeleton. Amputation activates intra-ray fibroblasts and dedifferentiates osteoblasts that migrate under a wound epidermis to establish an organized blastema. Coordinated proliferation and re-differentiation across lineages then sustains progressive outgrowth. We generate a single cell transcriptome dataset to characterize regenerative outgrowth and explore coordinated cell behaviors. We computationally identify sub-classes of fibroblast-lineage cells and describe novel markers of intra- and inter-ray fibroblasts and growth-promoting distal blastema cells. A pseudotemporal trajectory and in vivo photoconvertible lineage tracing indicate distal blastemal mesenchyme generates both re-differentiated intra- and inter-ray fibroblasts. Gene expression profiles across this trajectory suggest elevated protein translation in the blastemal mesenchyme state. O-propargyl-puromycin incorporation and small molecule inhibition identify insulin growth factor receptor (IGFR) / mechanistic target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR)-dependent elevated bulk translation in blastemal mesenchyme and differentiating osteoblasts. We test candidate cooperating differentiation factors identified from the osteoblast trajectory, finding IGFR/mTOR signaling expedites glucocorticoid-promoted osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Concordantly, mTOR inhibition slows but does not prevent fin regenerative outgrowth in vivo. IGFR/mTOR may elevate translation in both fibroblast- and osteoblast-lineage cells during the outgrowth phase as a tempo-coordinating rheostat.",
