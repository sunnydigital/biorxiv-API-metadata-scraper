    "abstract": "Dementia is multifactorial with Alzheimer (AD) and vascular (VaD) pathologies making the largest contributions. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified over 70 genetic risk loci for AD but the genomic determinants of other dementias, including VaD remain understudied. We hypothesize that common forms of dementia will share genetic risk factors and conducted the largest GWAS to date of \"all-cause dementia\" (ACD) and examined the genetic overlap with VaD. Our dataset includes 809,299 individuals from European, African, Asian, and Hispanic ancestries with 46,902 and 8,702 cases of ACD and VaD, respectively. We replicated known AD loci at genome-wide significance for both ACD and VaD and conducted bioinformatic analyses to prioritize genes that are likely functionally relevant, and shared with closely related traits and risk factors. For ACD, novel loci identified were associated with energy transport (SEMA4D), neuronal excitability (ANO3), amyloid deposition in the brain (RBFOX1), and MRI markers of small vessel disease (HBEGF). Novel VaD loci were associated with hypertension, diabetes, and neuron maintenance (SPRY2, FOXA2, AJAP1, and PSMA3). Our study identified genetic risks underlying all-cause dementia, demonstrating overlap with neurodegenerative processes, vascular risk factors (Type-II diabetes, blood pressure, lipid) and cerebral small vessel disease. These novel insights could lead to new prevention and treatment strategies for all dementias.",

    "abstract": "FtsZ, the tubulin homolog essential for bacterial cell division, assembles as Z-ring at the division site, and directs peptidoglycan synthesis by treadmilling. A key unanswered question is how FtsZ achieves its kinetic polarity that drives treadmilling. To obtain insights into fundamental features of FtsZ assembly dynamics independent of peptidoglycan synthesis, we report the characterization of FtsZ from the cell wall-less bacteria, Spiroplasma melliferum (SmFtsZ). SmFtsZ is a slower GTPase and has higher critical concentration (CC) for polymerization compared to Escherichia coli FtsZ (EcFtsZ). Analysis of the crystal structures of FtsZ structures reveal that the interaction of gamma phosphate of the nucleotide with the T3 loop leads to a peptide flip at Gly71. We propose that the flipped peptide conformation results in a key interaction that facilitates preferential binding of the N-terminal domain (NTD) of a GTP-bound FtsZ monomer to the C-terminal domain (CTD) exposed end of FtsZ filament. In FtsZs, a conformational switch from R- to T-state favors polymerization. We identified a residue, Phe224, located at the interdomain cleft of SmFtsZ, which is crucial for R- to T-state transition. The mutation F224M in SmFtsZ cleft resulted in higher GTPase activity and lower CC, whereas the corresponding M225F in EcFtsZ resulted in cell division defects in E. coli. Our results demonstrate that relative rotation of the domains is a rate-limiting step of polymerization. This step, in addition to the GTP-dependence of the T3 loop conformation, slows down the addition of monomers to the NTD-exposed end of filament in comparison to CTD end, thus explaining kinetic polarity.",

SBayesRC improves prediction accuracy by 14% in European ancestry and by up to 33% in trans-ancestry prediction, compared to the baseline method SBayesR which does not use annotations, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods LDpred-funct, PolyPred-S and PRS-CSx by 12-15%. Investigation of factors affecting prediction accuracy identified a significant interaction between SNP density and annotation information, encouraging future use of whole-genome sequence variants for prediction.

    "abstract": "Protein kinases are frequently dysregulated and/or mutated in cancer and represent essential targets for therapy. Accurate quantification is essential, but current approaches are inadequate. For breast cancer treatment for example, the identification and quantification of the protein kinase ERBB2 is critical for therapeutic decisions. While immunohistochemistry (IHC) is the current clinical diagnostic approach, it is only semiquantitative. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics offers more quantitative assays that, unlike IHC, can be used to accurately evaluate hundreds of kinases simultaneously. The enrichment of less abundant kinase targets for quantification, along with depletion of interfering proteins, improves sensitivity and thus promotes more effective downstream analyses. Multiple kinase inhibitors were therefore deployed as a capture matrix for kinase inhibitor pulldown (KiP) assays designed to profile the human protein kinome as broadly as possible. Optimized assays were initially evaluated in 16 patient derived xenograft models (PDX) where KiP identified multiple differentially expressed and biologically relevant kinases. From these analyses, an optimized single-shot parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) method was developed to improve quantitative fidelity. The PRM KiP approach was then reapplied to low quantities of proteins typical of protein yields from core needle biopsies of human cancers. The initial prototype targeting 100 kinases recapitulated intrinsic subtyping of PDX models obtained from comprehensive proteomic and transcriptomic profiling. Luminal and HER2 enriched OCT-frozen patient biopsies subsequently analyzed through KiP-PRM also clustered by subtype. Finally, stable isotope labeled peptide standards were developed to define a prototype clinical method.",

Among proteins, alpha helical coiled coils have such symmetric extendable architectures, but are limited by the relatively fixed geometry and flexibility of the helical protomers. Here, we describe a systematic approach to generating modular and rigid repeat protein oligomers with coincident C2 to C8 and superhelical symmetry axes that can be readily extended by repeat propagation. From these building blocks, we demonstrate that a wide range of unbounded fibers can be systematically designed by introducing hydrophilic surface patches that force staggering of the monomers; the geometry of such fibers can be precisely tuned by varying the number of repeat units in the monomer and the placement of the hydrophilic patches.",

    "abstract": "Transparent microelectrodes have received much attention from the biomedical community due to their unique advantages in concurrent crosstalk-free electrical and optical interrogation of cell/tissue activity. Despite recent progress in constructing transparent microelectrodes, a major challenge is to simultaneously achieve desirable mechanical stretchability, optical transparency, electrochemical performance, and chemical stability for high-fidelity, conformal, and stable interfacing with soft tissue/organ systems. To address this challenge, we have designed microelectrode arrays (MEAs) with gold coated silver nanowires (Au-Ag NWs) by combining technical advances in materials, fabrication, and mechanics. The Au coating improves both the chemical stability and electrochemical impedance of the Au-Ag NWs microelectrodes with only slight changes in optical properties. The MEAs exhibit a high optical transparency >80% at 550 nm, a low normalized 1 kHz electrochemical impedance of 1.2-7.5 {Omega} cm2, stable chemical and electromechanical performance after exposure to oxygen plasma for 5 minutes and cyclic stretching for 600 cycles at 20% strain, superior to other transparent microelectrode alternatives. The MEAs easily conform to curvilinear heart surfaces for co-localized electrophysiological and optical mapping of cardiac function. This work demonstrates that stretchable transparent metal nanowire MEAs are promising candidates for diverse biomedical science and engineering applications, particularly under mechanically dynamic conditions.",

    "abstract": "Clostridium thermocellum is a cellulolytic thermophile considered for consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose to ethanol. Improvements in ethanol yield are required for industrial implementation, but incompletely understood causes of amino acid secretion impede progress. In this study, amino acid secretion was investigated by gene deletions in ammonium-regulated NADPH-supplying and -consuming pathways and physiological characterization in cellobiose- or ammonium-limited chemostats. First, the contribution of the NADPH-supplying malate shunt was studied with strains using either the NADPH-yielding malate shunt ({Delta}ppdk) or redox-independent conversion of PEP to pyruvate ({Delta}ppdk {Delta}malE::Peno-pyk). In the latter, branched-chain amino acids, especially valine, were significantly reduced, whereas the ethanol yield increased 46-60%, suggesting that secretion of these amino acids balances NADPH surplus from the malate shunt. Unchanged amino acid secretion in {Delta}ppdk falsified a previous hypothesis on ammonium-regulated PEP-to-pyruvate flux redistribution. Possible involvement of another NADPH-supplier, namely NADH-dependent reduced ferredoxin:NADP+ oxidoreductase (nfnAB), was also excluded. Finally, deletion of glutamate synthase (gogat) in ammonium assimilation resulted in upregulation of NADPH-linked glutamate dehydrogenase activity and decreased amino acid yields. Since gogat in C. thermocellum is putatively annotated as ferredoxin-linked, which is supported by product redistribution observed in this study, this deletion likely replaced ferredoxin with NADPH in ammonium assimilation. Overall, these findings indicate that a need to reoxidize NADPH is driving the observed amino acid secretion, likely at the expense of NADH needed for ethanol formation. This suggests that metabolic engineering strategies on simplifying redox metabolism and ammonium assimilation can contribute to increased ethanol yields.\n\nImportanceImproving the ethanol yield of C. thermocellum is important for industrial implementation of this microorganism in consolidated bioprocessing. A central role of NADPH in driving amino acid byproduct formation was demonstrated, by eliminating the NADPH-supplying malate shunt and separately by changing the cofactor specificity in ammonium assimilation. With amino acid secretion diverting carbon and electrons away from ethanol, these insights are important for further metabolic engineering to reach industrial requirements on ethanol yield. This study also provides chemostat data relevant for training genome-scale metabolic models and improving the validity of their predictions, especially considering the reduced degree-of-freedom in redox metabolism of the strains generated here. In addition, this study advances fundamental understanding on mechanisms underlying amino acid secretion in cellulolytic Clostridia as well as regulation and cofactor specificity in ammonium assimilation. Together, these efforts aid development of C. thermocellum for sustainable consolidated bioprocessing of lignocellulose to ethanol with minimal pretreatment.",

    "abstract": "Tissue fibrosis remains a serious health condition with high morbidity and mortality rates. There is a critical need to engineer model systems that better recapitulate the spatial and temporal changes in the fibrotic extracellular microenvironment and enable study of the cellular and molecular alterations that occur during pathogenesis. Here, we present a process for chemically modifying human decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and incorporating it into a dynamically tunable hybrid-hydrogel system containing a poly(ethylene glycol)-alpha methacrylate (PEGMA) backbone. Following modification and characterization, an off-stoichiometry thiol-ene Michael addition reaction resulted in hybrid-hydrogels with mechanical properties that could be tuned to recapitulate many healthy tissue types. Next, photoinitiated, free-radical homopolymerization of excess -methacrylates increased crosslinking density and hybrid-hydrogel elastic modulus to mimic a fibrotic microenvironment. The incorporation of dECM into the PEGMAhydrogel decreased the elastic modulus and, relative to fully synthetic hydrogels, increased the swelling ratio, the average molecular weight between crosslinks, and the mesh size of hybrid-hydrogel networks. These changes were proportional to the amount of dECM incorporated into the network. Dynamic stiffening increased the elastic modulus and decreased the swelling ratio, average molecular weight between crosslinks, and the mesh size of hybrid-hydrogels, as expected. Stiffening also activated human fibroblasts, as measured by increases in average cellular aspect ratio (1.59 {+/-} 0.02 to 2.98 {+/-} 0.20) and expression of -smooth muscle actin (SMA). Fibroblasts expressing SMA increased from 24.4% to 51.8% upon dynamic stiffening, demonstrating that hybrid-hydrogels containing human dECM support investigation of dynamic mechanosensing. These results improve our understanding of the biomolecular networks formed within hybrid-hydrogels: this fully human phototunable hybrid-hydrogel system will enable researchers to control and decouple the biochemical changes that occur during fibrotic pathogenesis from the resulting increases in stiffness to study the dynamic cell-matrix interactions that perpetuate fibrotic diseases.",

Within optical microscopy, instrument performance is typically measured using sub-resolution fluorescent beads. However, the process is performed infrequently as it is requires time and suitably trained staff to acquire and then process the bead images. Analysis software still requires the manual entry of imaging parameters. Human error from repeatedly typing these parameters can significantly affect the outcome of the analysis, rendering the results less reproducibile. To avoid this issue, PyCalibrate has been developed to fully automate the analysis of bead images. PyCalibrate can be accessed either by executing the Python code locally or via a user-friendly web portal to further improve accessibility when moving between locations and machines. PyCalibrate interfaces with the BioFormats library to make it compatible with a wide range of proprietary image formats. In this study, PyCalibrate analysis performance is directly compared with alternative free-access analysis software PSFj, MetroloJ QC and DayBook3 and is demonstrated to have equivalent performance but without the need for user supervision.",

    "abstract": "The development of new nucleic acid techniques to quantify HIV RNA in plasma is critical for identifying the disease progression and monitoring the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy. While RT-qPCR has been the gold standard for HIV viral load quantification, digital assays could provide an alternative calibration-free absolute quantification method. Here, we report the development of a self-digitalization through automated membrane-based partitioning (STAMP) technique to digitalize the CRISPR-Cas13 assay (dCRISPR) for amplification-free and absolute quantification of HIV-1 viral RNAs. The analytical performances of STAMP-dCRISPR were evaluated with synthetic HIV-1 RNA, and it was found samples spanning 4 orders of dynamic range between 100 aM to 1 pM can be quantified as fast as 30 min. We also examined the overall assay from RNA extraction to STAMP-dCRISPR quantification with spiked plasma samples. The overall assay showed a resolution of 42 aM at a 90% confidence level. Finally, a total of 20 clinical plasma samples from patients were evaluated with STAMP-dCRISPR. The obtained results agreed well with the RT-qPCR. Our result demonstrates a new type of easy-to-use, scalable, and highly specific digital platform that would offer a simple and accessible platform for amplification-free quantification of viral RNAs, which could be exploited for the quantitative determination of viral load for an array of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Top-down liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analyzes intact proteoforms and generates mass spectra containing peaks of proteoforms with various isotopic compositions, charge states, and retention times. An essential step in top-down MS data analysis is proteoform feature detection, which aims to group these peaks into peak sets (features), each containing all peaks of a proteoform. Accurate protein feature detection enhances the accuracy in MS-based proteoform identification and quantification. Here we present TopFD, a software tool for top-down MS feature detection that integrates algorithms for proteoform feature detection, feature boundary refinement, and machine learning models for proteoform feature evaluation. We performed extensive benchmarking of TopFD, Promex, FlashDeconv, and Xtract using five top-down MS data sets and demonstrated that TopFD outperforms other tools in feature accuracy, reproducibility, and feature abundance reproducibility.",

    "abstract": "Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous malignancy involving the clonal expansion of myeloid stem and progenitor cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood. Most AML patients eligible for potentially curative treatment receive intensive chemotherapy. Risk stratification is used to optimize treatment intensity and transplant strategy, and is mainly based on cytogenetic screening for structural chromosomal alterations and targeted sequencing of a selection of common mutations. However, the forecasting accuracy of treatment response remains modest. Recently, ex vivo drug screening has gained traction for its potential in personalized treatment selection, as well as a tool for identifying and mapping patient groups based on relevant cancer dependencies. We systematically evaluated the use of drug sensitivity profiling for predicting patient survival and clinical response to chemotherapy in a cohort of AML patients. We compared computational methodologies for scoring drug efficacy and characterized tools to counter noise and batch-related confounders pervasive in high-throughput drug testing. We show that ex vivo drug sensitivity profiling is a robust and versatile approach to patient prognostics that comprehensively maps functional signatures of treatment response and disease progression. In conclusion, ex vivo drug profiling can accurately assess risk of individual AML patients and may guide clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "Large datasets along with sampling bias represent a challenge for phylodynamic reconstructions, particularly when the study data are obtained from various heterogeneous sources and/or through convenience sampling. In this study, we evaluate the presence of unbalanced sampled distribution by collection date, location, and risk group of HIV-1 subtype C using a compre-hensive subsampling strategy, and assess their impact on the reconstruction of the viral spatial and risk group dynamics using phylogenetic comparative methods. Our study shows that the most suitable dataset for ancestral trait reconstruction can be obtained through subsampling by collection date, location, and risk group, particularly using multigene datasets. We also demonstrate that sampling bias is inflated when considerable information for a given trait is unavailable or of poor quality, as we observed for the risk group in the analysis of HIV-1 subtype C. In conclusion, we suggest that, even if traits are not well recorded, including them deliberately optimizes the representativeness of the original dataset rather than completely excluding them. Therefore, we advise the inclusion of as many traits as possible with the aid of subsampling approaches in order to optimize the dataset for phylodynamic analysis while reducing the computational burden. This will benefit research communities investigating the evolutionary and spatiotemporal patterns of infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Differences in cells functions arise from differential action of regulatory elements, in particular enhancers. Like promoters, enhancers are genomic regions bound by transcription factors (TF) that activate the expression of one or several genes by getting physically close to them in the 3D space of the nucleus. As there is increasing evidence that variants associated with common diseases are located in enhancers active in cell types relevant to these diseases, knowing the set of enhancers and more importantly the sets of genes activated by each enhancer (the so-called enhancer/gene or E/G relationships) in a cell type, will certainly help understanding these diseases.\n\nThere are three broad approaches for the genome-wide identification of E/G relationships in a cell type: (1) genetic link methods or eQTL, (2) functional link methods based on 1D functional data such as open chromatin, histone mark and gene expression and (3) spatial link methods based on 3D data such as HiC. Since (1) and (3) are costly, there has been a focus on developing functional link methods and using data from (1) and (3) to evaluate them, however there is still no consensus on the best functional link method to date.\n\nFor this reason we decided to start from the two latest benchmarks of the field, namely from the CRISPRi-FlowFISH (CRiFF) technique and from 3D and eQTL data in BENGI, and to evaluate the two methods claimed to be the best one on each of these benchmark studies, namely the ABC model and the Average-Rank method respectively, on the other methods reference data. Not only did we manage to reproduce the results of the two benchmarks but we also saw that none of the two methods performed best on the two reference data. While CRiFF reference data are very reliable, it is not genome-wide and is mostly available on a cancer cell type. On the other hand BENGI is genome-wide but may contain many false positives. This study therefore calls for new reliable and genome-wide E/G reference data rather than new functional link E/G identification methods.",

For each cancer type we then selected the top 12 most mutated genes among their neoplasms.

    "abstract": "Many genes are co-expressed and form genomic domains of coordinated gene activity. However, the regulatory determinants of domain co-activity remain unclear. Here, we leverage human individual variation in gene expression to characterize the co-regulatory processes underlying domain co-activity and systematically quantify their effect sizes. We employ transcriptional decomposition to extract from RNA expression data an expression component related to co-activity revealed by genomic positioning. This strategy reveals close to 1,500 co-activity domains, covering most expressed genes, of which the large majority are invariable across individuals. Focusing specifically on domains with high variability in co-activity reveals that contained genes have a higher sharing of eQTLs, a higher variability in enhancer interactions, and an enrichment of binding by variably expressed transcription factors compared to genes within non-variable domains. Through careful quantification of the relative contributions of regulatory processes underlying co-activity, we find transcription factor expression levels to be the main determinant of gene co-activity. Our results indicate that distal trans effects contribute more than local genetic variation to individual variation in co-activity domains.",

    "abstract": "Epistatic, non-additive, interactions between mutations reveal the functional architecture of living systems, strongly shape evolution, and present a difficult challenge for bioengineers. Interpreting and modeling epistasis requires knowledge of the mechanisms that bring it about. We recently argued that \"ensemble epistasis\" could be a generic mechanism for epistasis between mutations introduced into a single macromolecule. Because proteins exist as ensembles of interconverting conformations, a mutation could induce epistasis by subtly altering ensemble composition and thus the effects of subsequent mutations. Here we show experimentally that the thermodynamic ensemble does indeed yield high magnitude epistasis in the lac repressor. We observed two- and three-way epistasis in DNA binding, with magnitudes as large or larger than the individual effects of mutations. This biophysical effect propagated to substantial epistasis in gene expression in vivo. As predicted in previous theoretical work, IPTG concentration tunes the magnitude of ensemble epistasis. Further, our observations could all be captured with a rigorous mathematical model of the lac repressor ensemble. Given that conformational ensembles are unavoidable features of macromolecules, we expect this is a ubiquitous and underappreciated cause of intramolecular epistasis.",

    "abstract": "Contributions of three components of slow axonal transport (SAT) were studied using a computational model: the anterograde motor (kinesin)-driven component, the retrograde motor (dynein)-driven component, and the diffusion-driven component. The contribution of these three components of SAT was investigated in three different segments of the axon: the proximal portion, the central portion, and the distal portion of the axon. MAP1B protein was used as a model system to study SAT because there are published experimental data reporting MAP1B distribution along the axon length and average velocity of MAP1B transport in the axon. This allows the optimization approach to be used to find values of model kinetic constants that give the best fit with published experimental data. The effects of decreasing the value of cargo diffusivity on the diffusion-driven component of SAT and decreasing the value of dynein velocity on the retrograde motor-driven component of SAT were investigated. We found that for the case when protein diffusivity and dynein velocity are very small, it is possible to obtain an analytical solution to model equations. We found that, in this case, the protein concentration in the axon is uniform. This shows that anterograde motor-driven transport alone cannot simulate a variation of cargo concentration in the axon. Most proteins are non-uniformly distributed in axons. They may exhibit, for example, an increased concentration closer to the synapse. The need to reproduce a non-uniform distribution of protein concentration may explain why SAT is bidirectional (in addition to an anterograde component, it also contains a retrograde component).",

We present a theoretical model of cellular polarization for cells migrating along one-dimensional lines, arriving at a symmetric Y-junction and extending protrusions along the different paths that emanate from the junction. The model predicts the spontaneous emergence of deterministic oscillations between competing protrusions, whereby the cellular polarization and growth alternates between the competing protrusions. The oscillations are modified by cellular noise, but remain as a dominant feature which affects the time it takes the cell to migrate across the junction. These predicted oscillations in the cellular polarization during the directional decision making process at the junction are found experimentally for two different cell types, non-cancerous endothelial and cancerous glioma cells, migrating on patterned network of thin adhesive lanes with junctions.",

    "abstract": "Nup98 FG repeat domains comprise hydrophobic FG motifs linked through uncharged spacers. FG motifs capture nuclear transport receptors (NTRs) during nuclear pore complex (NPC) passage, confer inter-repeat cohesion, and condense the domains into a selective phase with NPC-typical barrier properties. We found that shortening inter-FG spacers enhances cohesion, increases phase density, and tightens such barrier, all consistent with a sieve-like phase. Phase separation tolerated mutating the Nup98-typical GLFG motifs, provided domain-hydrophobicity remained preserved. NTR-entry, however, was sensitive to (certain) deviations from canonical FG motifs, suggesting co-evolutionary adaptation. Unexpectedly, we found arginines to promote FG-phase-entry apparently also by hydrophobic interactions/ H-bonding and not just through cation-{pi} interactions. Although incompatible with NTR{middle dot}cargo complexes, a YG phase displayed remarkable transport selectivity, particularly for engineered GFPNTR-variants. GLFG to FSFG mutations made the FG phase hypercohesive, precluding NTR-entry. Extending spacers relaxed this hypercohesion. Thus, antagonism between cohesion and NTR{middle dot}FG interactions is key to transport selectivity.",

    "abstract": "The Omicron variant (BA.1) and its sub-variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes the COVID-19 disease continues to spread across the United States and the World at large. As new sub-variants of SARS-CoV-2 continue to proliferate, a reliable computational method of quickly determining the potential infectivity of these new variants is needed to assess their potential threat. In the present study, we have tested and validated an efficient computational protocol, which includes an efficient energy minimization and subsequent molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM-PBSA) calculation of the binding free energy between the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), to predict the binding affinities of these spike/ACE2 complexes based upon the calculated binding free energies and a previously calibrated linear correlation relationship. The predicted binding affinities are in good agreement with available experimental data including those for Omicron variants, suggesting that the predictions based on this protocol should be reasonable. Further, we have investigated several hundred potential mutations of both the wildtype and Omicron variants of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Based on the predicted binding affinity data, we have identified several mutations that have the potential to vastly increase the binding affinity of the spike protein to ACE2 within both the wildtype and Omicron variants.\n\nAuthor SummaryAs well known, the coronavirus responsible for COVID-19 disease enters human cells through its spike protein binding with a human receptor protein known as angiotensin converting enzyme-2. So, the binding affinity between the spike protein and angiotensin converting enzyme-2 contributes to the infectivity of the coronavirus and its variants. In this study, we demonstrated that a generally applicable, fast and easy-to-use computational protocol was able to accurately predict the binding affinity of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 with spike protein of the currently known variants of the coronavirus. Hence, we believe that this computational protocol may be used to reliably predict the binding affinity of angiotensin converting enzyme-2 with spike protein of new variants to be identified in the future. Using this computational protocol, we have further examined a number of possible single mutations on the spike protein of both the wildtype and Omicron variants and predicted their binding affinity with angiotensin converting enzyme-2, demonstrating that several mutations have the potential to vastly increase the binding affinity of the spike protein to angiotensin converting enzyme-2.",

Here, we developed an assay system to dynamically measure second harmonic generation (SHG) polarization in pulsating cardiomyocyte and proved that the SHG anisotropy derived from myosin filaments in disease-model cardiomyocytes depended on their crossbridge status, providing an evaluation method for myosin force generation. Experiments utilizing an inheritable mutation that induces excessive myosin-actin interactions revealed that the correlation between sarcomere length and SHG anisotropy represents crossbridge formation ratio during pulsation. Furthermore, the present method found that ultraviolet irradiation induced an increased population of attached crossbridges that lost force-generating ability upon myocardial differentiation, causing acquired dysfunction. Taking an advantage of infrared two-photon excitation in SHG microscopy, myocardial dysfunction could be intravitally evaluated in a Drosophila disease model. Thus, along with the establishment of the methodology, we successfully demonstrated the applicability and effectiveness of the present method to evaluate the actomyosin activity of a drug or genetic defect on living cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "The present work examines the hypothesis that cochlear outer hair cell (OHC) properties vary in precise proportions along the tonotopic map to optimize electro-mechanical power conversion. We tested this hypothesis using a very simple model of a single isolated OHC driving a mechanical load. Results identify three nondimensional ratios that are predicted to optimize power conversion: the ratio of the resistive-capacitive (RC) corner to the characteristic frequency (CF), the ratio of nonlinear to linear capacitance, and the ratio of OHC stiffness to cochlear load stiffness. Optimum efficiency requires all three ratios to be universal constants, independent of CF and species. The same ratios are cardinal control parameters that maximize power output by positioning the OHC operating point on the edge of a dynamic instability. Results support the hypothesis that OHC properties evolved to optimize electro-mechanical power conversion. Identification of the RC corner frequency as a control parameter reveals a powerful mechanism used by medial olivocochlear efferent system to control OHC power output. Results indicate the upper frequency limit of OHC power output is not constrained by the speed of the motor itself, but instead is likely limited by the size of the nucleus and membrane surface area available for ion-channel expression.",

    "abstract": "Current approaches to drug delivery in adult zebrafish have significant limitations such as need for confinement, anesthesia, and/or dosing that is not based on body weight. To circumvent these challenges, we developed a non-invasive gelatin-based feed that is easily pipette into individually tailored morsels according to weight. Our feed was readily eaten by zebrafish (< 1 minute) with minimal leaching of compound (< 5%) when placed in water. We used our feed to deliver an NMDAR antagonist (MK-801, 4 mg/kg) prior to exposure to a novel tank. Consistent with prior work, we found that MK-801 caused a decrease in predator-avoidance/anxiety-like behaviors. We also found that MK-801 increased locomotion in male fish, but not females. Our simple, easy to prepare, and individually tailored gelatin-based feed now brings pharmacological manipulations of adult zebrafish in line with best practices used in other vertebrate model organisms.",

    "abstract": "Mechanical stretching of living tissues can activate long-lived changes in tissue cells such as fibroblasts, increasing their contractility and initiating phenotypic transformations. Increased mechanical stimulus typically leads to monotonically increasing activation of fibroblasts cultured in 2D, but activation levels are difficult to predict for cells in 3D fibrous tissues, leading to variable outcomes in procedures such as skin grafting. Here we report that the source of this variation is cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interactions and their variation with the duration and magnitude of applied stretch, and present a model that can predict the degree to which stretch will either increase or decrease long-term activation levels of fibroblasts cultured within a stretched, three-dimensional collagen matrix. Combining experimental and mathematical approaches across multiple scales, we show that the viscoplasticity of the ECM regulates this nonmonotonic, long-term cell activation. Results demonstrate that feedback between cell and ECM determines how cells retain memory of mechanical stretch.",

    "abstract": "Protein detection and biomarker profiling have wide-ranging implications in many areas of basic research and molecular diagnostics. Substantial progress has been made in protein analytics using nanopores and the resistive-pulse technique. Yet, a long-standing challenge is implementing specific binding interfaces for detecting proteins without the steric hindrance of the pore interior. To overcome this technological difficulty, we formulate a new class of sensing elements made of a programmable antibody-mimetic binder fused to a monomeric protein nanopore. This way, such a modular design significantly expands the utility of nanopore sensors to numerous proteins while preserving their architecture, specificity, and sensitivity. We prove the power of this approach by developing and validating nanopore sensors for protein analytes that drastically vary in size, charge, and structural complexity. These analytes produce unique electrical signatures that depend on their identity and quantity and the binder-analyte assembly at the nanopore tip. From a practical point of view, our sensors unambiguously probe protein recognition events without the necessity of using any additional exogenous tag. The outcomes of this work will impact biomedical diagnostics by providing a fundamental basis and tools for protein biomarker detection in biofluids.",

    "abstract": "The collective migration of keratinocytes during wound healing requires both the generation and transmission of mechanical forces for individual cellular locomotion and the coordination of movement across cells. Leader cells along the wound edge transmit mechanical and biochemical cues to ensuing follower cells, ensuring their coordinated direction of migration across multiple cells, or directionality. Despite the observed importance of mechanical cues in leader cell formation and controlling directionality, the underlying biophysical mechanisms remain elusive. The mechanically-activated ion channel PIEZO1 was recently identified to play an inhibitory role during the reepithelialization of wounds. Here, through an integrative experimental and mathematical modeling approach, we elucidate PIEZO1s contributions to collective migration. Time-lapse microscopy reveals that PIEZO1 activity inhibits leader cell formation along the wound edge. To probe the relationship between PIEZO1 activity, leader cell formation and inhibition of reepithelialization, we developed an integrative 2D-multiscale model of wound closure that links observations at the single cell and collective cell migration scales. Through numerical simulations and subsequent experimental validation, we found that directionality plays a key role during wound closure and is inhibited by upregulated PIEZO1 activity. We propose that PIEZO1-mediated retraction suppresses leader cell formation which inhibits coordination of directionality between cells during collective migration.",

    "abstract": "Derangements of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-retinal barrier (BRB) occur in disorders ranging from stroke, cancer, diabetic retinopathy, and Alzheimers disease. The Norrin/FZD4/TSPAN12 pathway activates WNT/{beta}-catenin signaling, which is essential for BBB and BRB function. However, systemic pharmacologic FZD4 stimulation is hindered by obligate palmitoylation and insolubility of native WNTs and suboptimal properties of the FZD4-selective ligand Norrin. Here, we developed L6-F4-2, a non-lipidated, FZD4-specific surrogate with significantly improved sub-picomolar affinity versus native Norrin. In Norrin knockout (NdpKO) mice, L6-F4-2 not only potently reversed neonatal retinal angiogenesis deficits, but also restored BRB and BBB function. In adult C57Bl/6J mice, post-stroke systemic delivery of L6-F4-2 strongly reduced BBB permeability, infarction, and edema, while improving neurologic score and capillary pericyte coverage. Our findings reveal systemic efficacy of a bioengineered FZD4-selective WNT surrogate during ischemic BBB dysfunction, with general applicability to adult CNS disorders characterized by an aberrant blood-brain barrier.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck cancers are the sixth most common cancer worldwide. Combinatorial targeted therapy has the potential to reduce drug resistance and increase cytotoxicity to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Using drug combinations is especially important when targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) since we previously demonstrated that activation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) is a mechanism for resistance against EGFR inhibition and that a combination of an IGF1R inhibitor, BMS754807, and an EGFR inhibitor, BMS599626, robustly inhibited the growth of HNSCC cell lines in vitro. To examine the mechanism of cytotoxicity, we performed protein pathway activation mapping via reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis of 145 proteins and phosphoproteins in five HNSCC cell lines to map key proteins and phosphoproteins important in tumorigenesis. By performing principal component analysis, calculating log fold changes, and constructing protein networks, we were able to provide evidence to support the hypothesis that the combination of IGF1R and EGFR inhibitors has a potentiative effect on inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. The effects of the individual drugs are amplified, demonstrating that the combination more robustly inhibits the pathways of both receptors.",

    "abstract": "Prostate tumours are highly reliant on lipids for energy, growth and survival. Activity of the androgen receptor (AR) is associated with reprogramming of lipid metabolic processes in prostate cancer, although the molecular underpinnings of this relationship remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Medium Chain Family Members 1 and 3 (ACSM1 and ACSM3) as AR-regulated mediators of prostate cancer metabolism and growth. ACSM1 and ACSM3 are upregulated in prostate tumours compared to non-malignant tissues and other cancer types. Both enzymes enhanced proliferation and protected PCa cells from death in vitro, while silencing ACSM3 led to reduced tumour growth in an orthotopic xenograft model. We show that ACSM1 and ACSM3 are major regulators of the PCa lipidome and enhance energy production via fatty acid oxidation. Metabolic dysregulation caused by loss of ACSM1/3 led to mitochondrial oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation and cell death by ferroptosis. Conversely, over-expression of ACSM1/3 enabled PCa cells to survive toxic doses of medium chain fatty acids and promoted resistance to ferroptosis-inducing drugs and AR antagonists. Collectively, these studies uncover a new link between AR and lipid metabolism and position ACSM1 and ACSM3 as key players in prostate cancer progression and therapy resistance.",

    "abstract": "The photoperiodic response is critical for plants to adjust their reproductive phase to the most favorable season. Wheat heads earlier under long days (LD) than under short days (SD) and this difference is mainly regulated by the PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) gene. Tetraploid wheat plants carrying the Ppd-A1a allele with a large deletion in the promoter head earlier under SD than plants carrying the wildtype Ppd-A1b allele with an intact promoter. Phytochromes PHYB and PHYC are necessary for the light activation of PPD1, and mutations in either of these genes result in the downregulation of PPD1 and very late heading time. We show here that both effects are reverted when the phyB mutant is combined with loss-of-function mutations in EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), a component of the Evening Complex (EC) in the circadian clock. We also show that the wheat ELF3 protein interacts with PHYB and PHYC, is rapidly modified by light, and binds to the PPD1 promoter in planta (likely as part of the EC). Deletion of the ELF3 binding region in the Ppd-A1a promoter results in its upregulation at dawn, similar to PPD1 alleles with intact promoters in the elf3 mutant background. The upregulation of PPD1 is correlated with the upregulation of the florigen gene FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1) and early heading time. Loss-of-function mutations in ppd1 result in the downregulation of FT1 and delayed heading, even when combined with the elf3 mutation. Taken together, these results indicate that ELF3 operates downstream of PHYB as a direct transcriptional repressor of PPD1, and that this repression is relaxed both by light and by the deletion of the ELF3 binding region in the Ppd-A1a promoter. In summary, the regulation of the light mediated activation of PPD1 by ELF3 is critical for the photoperiodic regulation of wheat heading time.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe coordination of reproductive development with the optimal season for seed production is critical to maximize grain yield in crop species. Plants can perceive the length of the day or night (photoperiod) and use this information to anticipate seasonal changes. In most eudicot plants, CONSTANS plays a central role in the perception of photoperiod, but in wheat the main photoperiod gene is PHOROPERIOD1 (PPD1). In this study, we show that the clock gene EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) regulates the phytochrome-mediated light activation of PPD1. Loss-of-function mutations in ELF3 result in the upregulation of PPD1 at and dawn, and in early heading under both long and short days, even in the absence of PHYB. A deletion in the PPD1 promoter including an ELF3 binding region also results in earlier heading under short days, indicating that ELF3 acts as a direct transcriptional repressor of PPD1. This study shows that ELF3 plays a critical role in the wheat photoperiod pathway by regulating the light signal between the phytochromes and PPD1. ELF3 provides an additional entry point to engineer heading time in wheat, an important trait for the development of better adapted varieties to a changing environment.",

This experiment compares the effect of water stress on the biomass production and chlorophyll content of lettuce (Lactuca sativa) and a weed species - moth plant (Araujia sericifera). The seedlings of the two plant species each were given three irrigation levels: 100% (T1), 50% (T2) and 0% (T3) field capacity of the growth medium - a mixture of peat moss (SuliFlor SF1(R)) and perlite (Perlindustria(R)) at ratio (3:1).

Data were collected on moisture content and salinity of growing media, fresh and dry weight of shoot and root of plants, height, number of leaves, leaf area and chlorophyll content of leaf. The result showed that the water stress conditions have no significant effect on the chlorophyll, plant height and number of leaves of the two plant species. While the moth plant was not significantly affected by the stress conditions, lettuce recorded a significant reduction in leaf area, and in the dry weight of root and aerial part of the totally stressed plants, this shows that lettuce growth is significantly affected by water stress. Hence, moth plant tolerates water stress conditions more than the lettuce plant and this result may also be indicative of the survival of the moth plant if it infests a lettuce field.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIt has been challenging to develop agents directly targeting KRAS driver mutations in colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent efforts have focused on developing inhibitors targeting SOS1 as an attractive approach for KRAS-mutant cancers. Here, we aimed to study the translational role of SOS1 in CRC using patient-derived organoids (PDOs).\n\nMethodIn this study, we used CRC PDOs as preclinical models to evaluate their sensitivity to SOS1 inhibitor BI3406 and its cellular effects. We utilized large CRC datasets including GENIE cohort, TCGA PanCancer Atlas, and CPTAC-2 cohort to study the significance of molecular alterations of SOS1 in CRC. To identify potential predictive markers, we performed immunohistochemistry (IHC) on CRC tissue for SOS1/2 protein expression and RNA sequencing to identify discriminative gene sets for sensitivity to SOS1 inhibition. The findings were validated by DepMap data for SOS1 dependency.\n\nResultCRC PDOs instead of cell lines had differential sensitivities to BI3406. There was a significant correlation between SOS1 and SOS2 mRNA expressions (Spearmans {rho} 0.56, p<0.001). SOS1/2 protein expression by IHC were universal with heterogeneous patterns in cancer cells but only minimal to none in surrounding non-malignant cells. SOS1 protein expression was associated with worse overall survival in patients with RAS/RAF mutant CRC (p=0.04). We also found that SOS1/SOS2 protein expression ratio > 1 by IHC (p=0.03) instead of KRAS mutation (p=1) was a better predictive marker to BI3406 sensitivity of CRC PDOs. This was concordant with the significant correlation between SOS1/SOS2 protein expression ratio by mass spectrometry and SOS1 dependency score. RNA-seq and gene set enrichment analysis revealed differentially expressed genes and 7 enriched gene sets involving cholesterol homeostasis, epithelial mesenchymal transition, and TNF/NF{kappa}B signaling in BI3406-resistant CRC PDOs. We further discovered that GTP-bound RAS level underwent rebound at 48 hours upon treatment with BI3406 even in BI3406-sensitive PDOs with no change of KRAS effector genes downstream. Cellular adaptation mechanisms to SOS1 inhibition may involve upregulation of SOS1/2 mRNA and SOS1 protein expressions, which may be overcome by SOS1 knockdown/degradation or synergistic effect of BI3406 with trametinib.\n\nConclusionIn summary, CRC PDOs could serve as better models for translational study of SOS1 in CRC. High SOS1 protein expression was a worse prognostic factor in CRC. High SOS1/SOS2 protein expression ratio predicted sensitivity to SOS1 inhibition and dependency. Our preclinical findings supported further clinical development of SOS1-targeting agents in CRC.",

    "abstract": "Daylength sensing in many plants is critical for coinciding the timing of flowering with the appropriate season. Temperate-climate-adapted grasses such as Brachypodium distachyon flower during the spring when days are becoming longer. The photoreceptor PHYTOCHROME C is essential for long-day (LD) flowering in B. distachyon. PHYC is required for the LD activation of a suite of genes in the photoperiod pathway including PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) that, in turn, result in the activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT1)/FLORIGEN, which causes flowering. Thus, phyC mutants are extremely delayed in flowering. Here we show that PHYC-mediated activation of PPD1 occurs via EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), a component of the evening complex in the circadian clock. The extreme delay of flowering of the phyC mutant disappears when combined with an elf3 loss-of-function mutation. Moreover, the dampened PPD1 expression in phyC mutant plants is elevated in phyC/elf3 mutant plants consistent with the rapid flowering of the double mutant. We show that loss of PPD1 function also results in reduced FT1 expression levels and extremely delayed flowering consistent with reports from wheat and barley. Additionally, elf3 mutant plants have elevated expression levels of PPD1 and we show that overexpression of ELF3 results in delayed flowering, which is associated with a reduction of PPD1 and FT1, demonstrating ELF3 represses PPD1 transcription, consistent with previous studies showing that ELF3 binds to the PPD1 promoter. Indeed, PPD1 is the main target of ELF3-mediated flowering as elf3/ppd1 double mutant plants are delayed flowering. Our results indicate that ELF3 operates downstream from PHYC and acts as a repressor of PPD1 in the photoperiod flowering pathway of B. distachyon.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDaylength is an important environmental cue that plants and animals use to coincide important life history events with a proper season. In plants, timing of flowering to a particular season is an essential adaptation to many ecological niches. Perceiving changes in daylength starts with the perception of light via specific photoreceptors such as phytochromes. In temperate grasses, how daylength perception is integrated into downstream pathways to trigger flowering is not fully understood. However, some of the components involved in the translation of daylength perception into the induction of flowering in temperate grasses have been identified from studies of natural variation. For example, specific alleles of two genes called EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3) and PHOTOPERIOD1 (PPD1) have been selected during breeding of different wheat and barley varieties to modulate the photoperiodic response to maximize reproduction in different environments. Here, we show in the temperate grass model Brachypodium distachyon that the translation of the light signal perceived by phytochromes into a flowering response is mediated by ELF3, and that PPD1 is genetically downstream of ELF3 in the photoperiodic flowering pathway. These results provide a genetic framework for understanding the photoperiodic response in temperate grasses that include agronomically important crops such as wheat, oats, barley, and rye.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is one of the deadliest malignancies facing modern oncology today. The ability of glioblastoma cells to diffusely spread into neighboring healthy brain makes complete surgical resection nearly impossible and contributes to the recurrent disease faced by most patients. Although research into the impact of iron on glioblastoma has addressed proliferation, there has been little investigation into how cellular iron impacts the ability of glioblastoma cells to migrate - a key question especially in the context of the diffuse spread observed in these tumors. Herein, we show that increasing cellular iron content results in decreased migratory capacity of human glioblastoma cells. The decrease in migratory capacity was accompanied by a decrease in cellular polarization in the direction of movement. Expression of CDC42, a Rho GTPase that is essential for both cellular migration and establishment of polarity in the direction of cell movement, was reduced upon iron treatment. Bioinformatic analysis of CDC42 mRNA revealed a potential iron-responsive element that may contribute to the regulation of CDC42 by iron. We then analyzed a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of human glioblastoma samples and found that cells at the tumor periphery had a gene signature that is consistent with having lower levels of cellular iron. Altogether, our results suggest that cellular iron content is impacting glioblastoma cell migratory capacity and that cells with higher iron levels exhibit reduced motility.",

    "abstract": "Radiopharmaceutical therapy is changing the standard of care in prostate cancer (PCa) and other malignancies. We previously reported high CD46 expression in PCa and developed an antibody-drug conjugate and immunoPET agent based on the YS5 antibody, which targets a tumor-selective CD46 epitope. Here, we present the preparation, preclinical efficacy, and toxicity evaluation of [225Ac]DOTA-YS5, a radioimmunotherapy agent based on the YS5 antibody. Our radiolabeled antibody retains binding efficacy and shows a high tumor to background ratio in PCa xenografts. Furthermore, we show that radiolabeled antibody was able to suppress the growth of cell-derived and patient-derived xenografts, including PSMA-positive and deficient models. Nephrotoxicity, not seen at low radioactive doses, is evident at higher radioactivity dose levels, likely due to redistribution of daughter isotope 213Bi. Overall, this preclinical study confirms that [225Ac]DOTA-YS5 is a highly effective treatment and suggests feasibility for clinical translation of CD46 targeted radioligand therapy in PCa.",

When it comes to self-retractions for honest errors, exposure of ones own failures is not a trivial matter for researchers. However, self-correcting data, results and/or conclusions has increasingly been perceived as good research practice, although rewarding such practice challenges traditional models of research assessment. In this context, it is timely to investigate who have self-retracted for honest error in terms of country, field, and gender. We show results on these three factors, focusing on gender, as data is scarce on the representation of female scientists in efforts to set the research record straight. We collected 3,822 retraction records, including research articles, review papers, meta-analyses, letters, and others, from the Retraction Watch Database (2010-2021). We screened the dataset collected for research articles retracted for honest error, excluding retractions by publishers, editors, or third parties, and those mentioning any investigation issues. We then categorized the records according to country, field, and gender, after selecting research articles with a sole corresponding author. Our results show that female scientists account for 25% of self-retractions for honest error, with the highest share for women affiliated with US institutions.",

    "abstract": "Microbes which participate in extracellular electron uptake or H2 oxidation have an extraordinary ability to manufacture organic compounds using electricity as the primary source of metabolic energy. So-called electromicrobial production could be of particular value in the efficient production of hydrocarbon blends for use in aviation. Because of exacting standards for fuel energy density and the costs of new aviation infrastructure, liquid hydrocarbon fuels will be necessary for the foreseeable future, precluding direct electrification. Production of hydrocarbons using electrically-powered microbes employing fatty acid synthesis-based production of alkanes could be an efficient means to produce drop-in replacement jet fuels using renewable energy. Here, we calculate the upper limit electrical-to-energy conversion efficiency for a model jet fuel blend containing 85% straight-chain alkanes and 15% terpenoids. When using the Calvin cycle for carbon-fixation, the energy conversion efficiency is [Formula] when using extracellular electron uptake for electron delivery and [Formula] when using H2-oxidation. The efficiency of production of the jet fuel blend can be raised to [Formula] when using the Formolase formate-assimilation pathway and H2-oxidation, and to [Formula] with the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. The production efficiency can be further raised by swapping the well-known ADO pathway for alkane termination with for the recently discovered MCH pathway. If these systems were were supplied with electricity with a maximally-efficient silicon solar photovoltaic, even the least efficient would exceed the maximum efficiency of all known forms of photosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Whole-cell biosensors are emerging as promising tools for monitoring environmental pollutants such as heavy metals. These sensors constitute a genetic circuit comprising a sensing module and an output module, such that a detectable signal is produced in the presence of the desired analyte. The MerR family of metal-responsive regulators offers great potential for the construction of metal sensing circuits, due to their high sensitivity, tight transcription control and large diversity in metal-specificity. However, the sensing diversity is broadest in Gram-negative systems, while chassis organisms are often selected from Gram-positive species, particularly sporulating bacilli. This can be problematic, because Gram-negative biological parts, such as promoters, are frequently observed to be non-functional in Gram-positive hosts. Herein, we combined construction of synthetic genetic circuits and chimeric MerR regulators, supported by structure-guided design, to generate metal-sensitive biosensor modules that are functional in the biotechnological work-horse species Bacillus subtilis. These chimeras consist of a constant Gram-positive derived DNA-binding domain fused to variable metal binding domains of Gram-negative origins. To improve the specificity of the whole-cell biosensor, we developed a modular  AND gate logic system based on the B. subtilis natively split {sigma}-factor, SigO-RsoA, designed to maximise future use for synthetic biology applications in B. subtilis. This work provides insights into the use of modular regulators, such as the MerR family, in the design of synthetic circuits for the detection of heavy metals, with potential wider applicability of the approach to other systems and genetic backgrounds.",

However, the role of TnpB in transposition and its contributions to genome dynamics remain elusive. Using a suite of fluorescent reporters coupled to transposition, we show that TnpB increases IS608-transposon activity and prevents transposon loss from genomes. Analyzing our results through a mathematical model of transposon dynamics, we discuss the multifaceted roles TnpB may play in transposon regulation. The mutually beneficial transposon-TnpB interaction may explain the prevalence of tnpB, creating conditions for the proliferation and appropriation of TnpBs RNA-guided endonuclease activity for adaptive immunity.",

    "abstract": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a blood cancer characterized by dysregulated production of maturing myeloid cells driven by the product of the Philadelphia chromosome, the BCR-ABL1 tyrosine kinase. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have proved effective in treating CML but there is still a cohort of patients who do not respond to TKI therapy even in the absence of mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain that mediate drug resistance. To discover novel strategies to improve TKI therapy in CML, we developed a nonlinear mathematical model of CML hematopoiesis that incorporates feedback control and lineage branching. Cell-cell interactions were constrained using an automated model selection method together with previous observations and new in vivo data from a chimeric BCR-ABL1 transgenic mouse model of CML. The resulting quantitative model captures the dynamics of normal and CML cells at various stages of the disease and exhibits variable responses to TKI treatment, consistent with those of CML patients. The model predicts that an increase in the proportion of CML stem cells in the bone marrow would decrease the tendency of the disease to respond to TKI therapy, in concordance with clinical data and confirmed experimentally in mice. The model further suggests that a key predictor of refractory response to TKI treatment is an increased probability of self-renewal of normal hematopoietic stem cells. We use these insights to develop a clinical prognostic criterion to predict the efficacy of TKI treatment and to design strategies to improve treatment response. The model predicts that stimulating the differentiation of leukemic stem cells while applying TKI therapy can significantly improve treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac diseases are characterized by the inability of adult mammalian hearts to overcome the loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs). Current knowledge in cardiac regeneration lacks a clear understanding of the molecular systems determining whether CMs will progress through the cell cycle to proliferate. Here, we developed a computational model of cardiac proliferation signaling that identifies key regulators and provides a systems-level understanding of the cardiomyocyte proliferation regulatory network. This model defines five regulatory networks (DNA replication, mitosis, cytokinesis, growth factor, hippo pathway) of cardiomyocyte proliferation, which integrates 72 nodes and 88 reactions. The model correctly predicts 72 of 76 (94.7%) independent experiments from the literature. Network analysis predicted key signaling regulators of DNA replication (e.g., AKT, CDC25A, Cyclin D/CDK4, E2F), mitosis (e.g., Cyclin B/CDK2, CDC25B/C, PLK1), and cytokinesis, whose functions varied depending on the environmental context. Regulators of DNA replication were found to be highly context-dependent, while regulators of mitosis and cytokinesis were context-independent. We also predicted that in response to the YAP-activating compound TT-10, the Hippo module crosstalks with the growth factor module via PI3K, cMyc, and FoxM1 to drive proliferation. This prediction was validated with inhibitor experiments in primary rat cardiomyocytes and further supported by re-analysis of published data on YAP-stimulated mRNA and open chromatin of Myc from mouse hearts. This study contributes a systems framework for understanding cardiomyocyte proliferation and identifies potential therapeutic regulators that induce cardiomyocyte proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Geometric morphometrics is widely used to quantify morphological variation between biological specimens, but the fundamental influence of operator bias on data reproducibility is rarely considered, particularly in studies using photographs of live animals taken under field conditions. We examined this using four independent operators that applied an identical landmarking scheme to replicate photographs of 291 live Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) from two rivers. Using repeated measures tests, we found significant inter-operator differences in mean body shape, suggesting that the operators introduced a systematic error despite following the same landmarking scheme. No significant differences were detected when the landmarking process was repeated by the same operator on a random subset of photographs. Importantly, in spite of significant operator bias, small but statistically significant morphological differences between fish from the two rivers were found consistently by all operators. Pairwise tests of angles of vectors of shape change showed that these between-river differences in body shape were analogous across operator datasets, suggesting a general reproducibility of findings obtained by geometric morphometric studies. In contrast, merging landmark data when fish from each river are digitised by different operators had a significant impact on downstream analyses, highlighting an intrinsic risk of bias. Overall, we show that, even when significant inter-operator error is introduced during digitisation, following an identical landmarking scheme can identify morphological differences between populations. This study indicates that operators digitising at least a sub-set of all data groups of interest may be an effective way of mitigating inter-operator error and potentially enabling data sharing.",

Our knowledge of silk structure and production in Lepidoptera is based largely on the biology of the domestic silk moth (Bombyx mori), but recent comparative evidence suggests that silk production and structure vary widely across moth taxa. Some species like the Indian meal moth (Plodia interpunctella) are becoming important biological models to study silk for its potential application to materials science and medicine, but many aspects of silk production in this species remain unknown. Here we characterize the silk of P. interpunctella by measuring the width of wandering and pupal silk strands and find that pupal silk is significantly thicker than the latter. We then report individual variation in pupal silk production in our lab-reared colony with a very small number of individuals forgoing pupal silk (< 4%) and find that overcrowding had no effect on this, whereas exposure to elevated temperatures reduced rates of pupal silk production.",

    "abstract": "A major pathological hallmark of Parkinsons Disease (PD) is the manifestation of Lewy bodies comprised of alpha-synuclein (-syn). The accumulation of -syn enriched protein aggregates is thought to arise from dysfunction in degradation systems within the brain. Recently, missense mutations of SYNJ1 encoding the SAC1 and 5-phosphatase domains have been found in families with hereditary early-onset Parkinsonism. Previous studies showed that Synj1 haploinsufficiency (Synj1+/-) leads to PD-like behavioral and pathological changes in mice, including the accumulation of the autophagy substrate p62 and pathological -syn proteins in the midbrain (MB) and striatum. In this study, we aim to investigate the neuronal degradation pathway using the Synj1+/- MB culture as a model. Our data suggests that autophagy flux and cumulative autophagosome formation is unaltered at baseline in Synj1+/- MB neurons. However, lysosome number is reduced with a similar decrease in lysosomal proteins, including LAMP1, LAMP2, and LAMP2A. Lysosomes are hyperacidified with enhanced enzymatic activity in Synj1+/- MB neurons. Using a combination of light and electron microscopy, we show that lysosomal changes are primarily associated with a lack of SAC1 activity. Consistently, expressing the SYNJ1 R258Q mutant in N2a cells reduces the lysosome number. Interestingly, the lysosomal defects in Synj1+/- neurons does not impact the clearance of exogenously expressed wild-type -syn; however, the clearance of -syn A53T was impaired in the axons of Synj1+/- MB neurons. Taken together, our results suggest axonal vulnerability to lysosomal defects in Synj1 deficient MB neurons.\n\nSignificance StatementIn the study, Zhu et al. discovered a previously uncharacterized role of Synj1 in regulating lysosomal number, protein, and acidity in ventral midbrain neurons. These alterations are associated with a specific impairment in the clearance of -syn A53T, but not WT -syn in axons, suggesting an essential role of Synj1 in axonal degradative capacity under pathological stress. This work in cultured mammalian neurons complements recent research efforts in Drosophila, C. elegans and zebra fish, and provides a novel insight for the role Synj1 in neuronal autolysosomal function.",

    "abstract": "Individual differences in cognition during childhood are associated with important social, physical, and mental health outcomes in adolescence and adulthood. Given that cortical surface arealization during development reflects the brains functional prioritization, quantifying variation in the topography of functional brain networks across the developing cortex may provide insight regarding individual differences in cognition. We test this idea by defining personalized functional networks (PFNs) that account for interindividual heterogeneity in functional brain network topography in 9-10 year olds from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM Study. Across matched discovery (n=3,525) and replication (n=3,447) samples, the total cortical representation of fronto-parietal PFNs positively correlated with general cognition. Cross-validated ridge regressions trained on PFN topography predicted cognition across domains, with prediction accuracy increasing along the cortexs sensorimotor-association organizational axis. These results establish that functional network topography heterogeneity is associated with individual differences in cognition before the critical transition into adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Indirect quantification of functional and structural disconnection increases the knowledge derived from focal brain lesions by inferring subsequent brain network damage from the respective lesion. We applied both measures to a sample of 124 stroke patients to investigate brain disconnection in pusher syndrome - a disorder characterized by a disturbed perception of ones own upright body posture. Our results suggest a hub-like function of the posterior and lateral portions of the thalamus in the perception of ones own postural upright and identified dysfunction in a thalamo-cortical network as one likely cause of pusher syndrome. Lesion network-symptom-mapping investigating functional disconnection indicated cortical diaschisis in cerebellar, frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal areas in patients with thalamic lesions suffering from pusher syndrome, but there was no evidence for functional diaschisis in cortical stroke and no evidence for the convergence of thalamic and cortical lesions onto a common functional network. Structural disconnectivity mapping identified several thalamo-cortical disconnections. Many of the thalamic and cortical regions disconnected by lesions that lead to pusher behavior correspond to previously reported lesion sites associated with pusher syndrome. Thus, while the presence of both, isolated thalamic and cortical lesions in context with pusher behavior has been reported previously and led to the conclusion that the correct estimation of ones own postural upright might depend on a thalamo-cortical network, our analyses offer the first evidence for a direct thalamo-cortical (or cortico-thalamic) interconnection and, more importantly, shed light on the location of the respective thalamo-cortical disconnections.",

    "abstract": "Despite impressive results from neuroscience research using rodent models, there is a paucity of successful translation from preclinical findings to effective pharmacological interventions for treatment of substance use disorder (SUD) in humans. One potential reason for lack of translation from animal models is difficulty in accurately replicating the lived experience of people who use drugs. Aspects of substance use in humans that are often not modeled in animal research include but are not limited to 1) voluntary timing and frequency of substance intake, 2) social environment during substance use, and 3) access to multiple substances and multiple concentrations of each substance. Critically, existing commercial equipment that allows for social housing and voluntary polysubstance use (e.g., home cage monitoring system) is prohibitively expensive and no open-source solutions exist. With these goals in mind, here we detail development of the Socially Integrated Polysubstance (SIP) system, an open-source and lower cost solution that allows for group housed rodents to self-administer multiple substances with continuous monitoring and measurement. In our current setup, each SIP cage contains four drinking stations, and each station is equipped with a RFID sensor and sipper tube connected to a unique fluid reservoir. Using this system, we can track which animal (implanted with unique RFID transponder) visits which drinking location and the amount they drink during each visit (in 20 ul increments). Using four flavors of Kool-Aid, here we demonstrate that the SIP system is reliable and accurate with high temporal resolution for long term monitoring of substance intake and behavior tracking in a social environment. The SIP cage system is a first step towards designing an accessible and flexible rodent model of substance use that more closely resembles the experience of people who use drugs.",

    "abstract": "Subjective perceptual experience is influenced not only by bottom-up sensory information and experience-based top-down processes, but also by an individuals current brain state. Specifically, a previous study found increased prestimulus insula and intraparietal sulcus (IPS) activity before participants perceived an illusory Gestalt (global) compared to the non-illusory (local) interpretation in a bistable stimulus. This study provided only a snapshot of the prestimulus brain state that favors an illusory interpretation. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that the neural machinery that biases perception towards the illusory interpretation immediately before the stimulus onset, is also predictive of an individuals general tendency to perceive it, which remains stable over time. We examined individual differences in task-free functional connectivity of insula and IPS and related it to differences in the individuals duration of the two interpretations. We found stronger connectivity of the IPS with areas of the default mode and visual networks to predict shorter local perceptual phases, i.e., a faster switch to an illusory percept, but no equivalent results for the insula. Our findings suggest a crucial role of an IPS interaction with nodes of key intrinsic networks in forming a perceptual tendency towards illusory Gestalt perception.",

    "abstract": "Complex macro-scale patterns of brain activity that emerge during periods of wakeful rest provide insight into the organisation of neural function, how these differentiate individuals based on their traits, and the neural basis of different types of self-generated thoughts. Although brain activity during wakeful rest is valuable for understanding important features of human cognition, its unconstrained nature makes it difficult to disentangle neural features related to personality traits from those related to the thoughts occurring at rest. Our study builds on recent perspectives from work on ongoing conscious thought that highlight the interactions between three brain networks - ventral and dorsal attention networks, as well as the default mode network. We combined measures of personality with state-of-the-art indices of ongoing thoughts at rest and brain imaging analysis, and explored whether this  tri-partite view can provide a framework within which to understand the contribution of states and traits to observed patterns of neural activity at rest. To capture macro-scale relationships between different brain systems, we calculated cortical gradients to describe brain organisation in a low dimensional space. Our analysis established that for more introverted individuals, regions of the ventral attention network were functionally more aligned to regions of the somatomotor system and the default mode network. At the same time, a pattern of detailed self-generated thought was associated with a decoupling of regions of dorsal attention from regions in the default mode network. Our study, therefore, establishes interactions between attention systems and the default mode network are important influences on ongoing thought at rest and highlights the value of integrating contemporary perspectives on conscious experience when understanding patterns of brain activity at rest.",

    "abstract": "Each time we make an eye movement, attention moves before the eyes, resulting in a perceptual enhancement at the target. Recent psychophysical studies suggest that this pre-saccadic attention enhances the visual features at the saccade target, whereas covert attention causes only spatially-selective enhancements. While previous non-human primate studies have found that pre-saccadic attention does enhance neural responses spatially, no studies have tested if changes in neural tuning reflects an automatic feature enhancement. Here we examined pre-saccadic attention using a saccade foraging task developed for marmoset monkeys. We recorded from neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area with peripheral receptive fields that contained a motion stimulus which would either be the target of a saccade or a distracter as a saccade was made to another location. We established that marmosets, like macaques, show enhanced pre-saccadic neural responses for saccades towards the receptive field, including increases in firing rate and motion information. We then examined if the specific changes in neural tuning might support feature enhancements for the target. Neurons exhibited diverse changes in tuning, but predominantly showed additive and multiplicative increases that were uniformly applied across motion directions. These findings confirm that marmoset monkeys, like macaques, exhibit pre-saccadic neural enhancements during saccade foraging tasks with minimal training requirements. However, at the level of individual neurons, the lack of feature-tuned enhancements is similar to neural effects reported during covert spatial attention.\n\nSignificance StatementAttention leads eye movements producing perceptual enhancements at saccade targets. Recent psychophysical studies indicate that increases in pre-saccadic sensitivity are concentrated around features of the target. We tested at the neural level how pre-saccadic attention modulates the tuning curves of visual neurons in area MT of marmoset monkeys. While neurons exhibited clear pre-saccadic enhancements that were consistent with previous studies in macaques, the changes in tuning were uniform across tuning. These results show pre-saccadic enhancements are a general feature of visual processing, shared by New World monkeys, but at the level of individual neurons enhancements are uniform across features much like what has been reported previously for covert attention.",

Introduced here is a mathematical model of interactions between gut serotonin and its impact on ENT. The model was used to identify three key factors that affect ENT size, namely, serotonin production, its clearance, and its ability to act as a growth factor on ENT. The model was used to reproduce experimentally reported results from a mouse model by Margolis et al. (2016), which connected serotonin-mediated ENT hypoplasia to an ASD phenotype. The proposed mathematical model was used to scale the quantified relationship from mice to humans to show how the combination of these three factors can translate to a quantifiable metric that could potentially be correlated to ASD spectrum.

Here we utilise temporal response functions computed from electrophysiological responses to nursery rhymes to investigate the cortical encoding of phonetic features in a longitudinal cohort of infants when aged 4, 7 and 11 months, as well as adults. The analyses reveal an increasingly detailed and acoustically-invariant phonetic encoding over the first year of life, providing the first direct evidence that the pre-verbal human cortex learns phonetic categories.

We report the results of three healthy AST meditation volunteers in this case-report study (Case 1 - age = 26 years, meditative practice time = 2 months; Case 2 - age = 39 years, meditative practice time = 6 years; Case 3 - age = 59 years, meditative practice time = 40 years). In study 1, the volunteers performed a protocol with simultaneous recording of EEG and skin conductance while performing the Stroop test (T0), followed by 20 minutes of AST meditation and immediately the same protocol performed at T0 (T1). We analyzed P300 amplitude and latency, as well as test behavioral response and skin conductance activity before and immediately after a single session of AST. In study 2, the same volunteers performed three tasks with eyes closed on two EEG equipment (traditional and wireless): resting state, cognitive activity and one session of AST, each for 20 minutes. We measured the frontal interhemispheric coherence of alpha1 (8-10 Hz) and beta (13-30 Hz) for each condition and EEG type. Our main findings show that there is an immediate beneficial effect after AST meditation at the level of the same individual with different patterns of P300 and skin conductance activity and that AST meditation is marked by an overall increase in the frontal coherence of alpha1 and beta bands, when compared to other mental states. We conclude that 1) there is an immediate effect on cognition and executive control after AST meditation, 2) the frontal interhemispheric coherence of alpha1 and beta bands are increased during AST, and 3) wireless EEG exhibits the same characteristics observed in traditional EEG and therefore can be used to describe cortical dynamics during AST.",

We found area-specific cortical neurons, as well as an unexpectedly high diversity of midbrain and hindbrain neurons. Astrocytes also exhibited regional diversity at multiple scales, comprising subtypes specific to the telencephalon and to more precise anatomical locations. Oligodendrocyte precursors comprised two distinct major types specific to the telencephalon and to the rest of the brain. Together, these findings demonstrate the unique cellular composition of the telencephalon with respect to all major brain cell types.

    "abstract": "Spike-frequency adaptation (SFA) is a fundamental neuronal mechanism taking into account the fatigue due to spike emissions and the consequent reduction of the firing activity. We have studied the effect of this adaptation mechanism on the macroscopic dynamics of excitatory and inhibitory networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons coupled via exponentially decaying post-synaptic potentials. In particular, we have studied the population activities by employing an exact mean field reduction, which gives rise to next generation neural mass models. This low-dimensional reduction allows for the derivation of bifurcation diagrams and the identification of the possible macroscopic regimes emerging both in a single and in two identically coupled neural masses. In single popukations SFA favours the emergence of population bursts in excitatory networks, while it hinders tonic population spiking for inhibitory ones. The symmetric coupling of two neural masses, in absence of adaptation, leads to the emergence of macroscopic solutions with broken symmetry : namely, chimera-like solutions in the inhibitory case and anti-phase population spikes in the excitatory one. The addition of SFA leads to new collective dynamical regimes exhibiting cross-frequency coupling (CFC) among the fast synaptic time scale and the slow adaptation one, ranging from anti-phase slow-fast nested oscillations to symmetric and asymmetric bursting phenomena. The analysis of these CFC rhythms in the{theta} -{gamma} range has revealed that a reduction of SFA leads to an increase of the{theta} frequency joined to a decrease of the{gamma} one. This is analogous to what reported experimentally for the hippocampus and the olfactory cortex of rodents under cholinergic modulation, that is known to reduce SFA.",

Here, we demonstrate that candidalysin secreted by hyphae promotes the stimulation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), while synthetic candidalysin triggers a distinct mechanism for NET-like structures (NLS), which are more compact and less fibrous than canonical NETs. Candidalysin activates NADPH oxidase and calcium influx, with both processes contributing to morphological changes in neutrophils resulting in NLS formation. NLS are induced by leukotoxic hypercitrullination, which is governed by protein arginine deaminase 4 activation via calcium influx and initiation of intracellular signalling events. However, activation of signalling by candidalysin does not suffice to trigger downstream events essential for NET formation, as demonstrated by lack of lamin A/C phosphorylation, an event required for activation of cyclin-dependent kinases that are crucial for NET release. Interestingly, exposure to candidalysin does not immediately restrict the capability of neutrophils to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), nor to phagocytose particles. Instead, candidalysin triggers ROS production, calcium influx and subsequent activation of downstream signalling that drive morphological alteration and the formation of NLS in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Notably, candidalysin-triggered NLS demonstrate anti-Candida activity, which is resistant to nuclease treatment and dependent on the deprivation of Zn2+. This study reveals that C. albicans hyphae releasing candidalysin concurrently trigger canonical NETs and NLS, which together form a fibrous sticky network that entangles C. albicans hyphae and inhibits their growth. Importantly, this explains discrepancies of previous studies demonstrating that neutrophil-derived extracellular chromatin structures triggered by C. albicans can be both dependent and independent of ROS. Our data also demonstrate that while candidalysin hampers neutrophil function, the toxin also increases the capability of neutrophils to entangle hyphae and to restrict their growth, reflecting the importance of human neutrophils in controlling the dissemination of C. albicans.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed a dataset of 964 clonally unrelated murine antibodies for which structures have been deposited in the PDB. 454 of the 964 antibodies have gapless germline assignments and do not have excessive numbers of computationally identified somatic hypermutations (SHMs). About 5,500 SHMs were identified, of which approximately 3,500 are in the framework. We then searched for correlated convergent SHMs, i.e. groups of SHMs that arose independently in different antibodies but at the same sequence position and with the same germline and mature amino acid identity. A surprisingly large number of groups of correlated convergent SHMs were found. 329 antibodies share at least two, 161 antibodies share at least three, 87 antibodies share at least four, and 53 antibodies share at least five identical SHMs with another antibody in the dataset. We then analyzed whether any of the correlated SHMs are forming structural cluster. Approximately 400 clusters where CFWMs are located within 10 [A] of each other were identified. 158 of these clusters are in the framework region. Identification of such structural clusters of correlated convergent SHMs may help identify adaptive mutations that act in an antigen-independent manner.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has remained a human medical threat due to the continued evolution of multiple variants that acquire resistance to vaccines and prior infection. Therefore, it is imperative to discover monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize a broad range of SARS-CoV-2 variants for therapeutic and prophylactic use. A stabilized autologous SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein was used to enrich antigen-specific B cells from an individual with a primary Gamma variant infection. Five mAbs selected from those B cells showed considerable neutralizing potency against multiple variants of concern, with COVA309-35 being the most potent against the autologous virus, as well as against Omicron BA.1 and BA.2. When combining the COVA309 mAbs as cocktails or bispecific antibody formats, the breadth and potency was significantly improved against all tested variants. In addition, the mechanism of cross-neutralization of the COVA309 mAbs was elucidated by structural analysis. Altogether these data indicate that a Gamma-infected individual can develop broadly neutralizing antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella are common pests of beehives and commercial apiaries, and in more applied settings, these insects act as alternative in vivo bioassays to rodents for studying microbial virulence, antibiotic development, and toxicology. In the current study, our overall aim was to assess the putative adverse effects of background gamma radiation levels on G. mellonella. To achieve this, we exposed larvae to low (0.014 mGy/h), medium (0.056 mGy/h), and high (1.33 mGy/h) doses of caesium-137 and measured larval pupation events, weight, faecal discharge, susceptibility to bacterial and fungal challenges, immune cell counts, activity, and viability (i.e., haemocyte encapsulation) and melanisation levels. The effects of low and medium levels of radiation were distinguishable from the highest dose rates used - the latter insects weighed the least and pupated earlier. In general, radiation exposure modulated cellular and humoral immunity over time, with larvae showing heighted encapsulation/melanisation levels at the higher dose rates but were more susceptible to bacterial (Photorhabdus luminescens) infection. There were few signs of radiation impacts after 7 days exposure, whereas marked changes were recorded between 14 and 28 days. Our data suggest that G. mellonella demonstrates plasticity at the whole organism and cellular levels when irradiated and offers insight into how such animals may cope in radiologically contaminated environments.",

    "abstract": "Transmission bottlenecks limit the spread of novel mutations and reduce the efficiency of natural selection along a transmission chain. Many viruses exhibit tight bottlenecks, and studies of early SARS-CoV-2 lineages identified a bottleneck of 1-3 infectious virions. While increased force of infection, host receptor binding, or immune evasion may influence bottleneck size, the relationship between transmissibility and the transmission bottleneck is unclear. Here, we compare the transmission bottleneck of non-variant-of-concern (non-VOC) SARS-CoV-2 lineages to those of the Alpha, Delta, and Omicron variants. We sequenced viruses from 168 individuals in 65 multiply infected households in duplicate to high depth of coverage. In 110 specimens collected close to the time of transmission, within-host diversity was extremely low. At a 2% frequency threshold, 51% had no intrahost single nucleotide variants (iSNV), and 42% had 1-2 iSNV. In 64 possible transmission pairs with detectable iSNV, we identified a bottleneck of 1 infectious virion (95% CI 1-1) for Alpha, Delta, and Omicron lineages and 2 (95% CI 2-2) in non-VOC lineages. The latter was driven by a single iSNV shared in one non-VOC household. The tight transmission bottleneck in SARS-CoV-2 is due to low genetic diversity at the time of transmission, a relationship that may be more pronounced in rapidly transmissible variants. The tight bottlenecks identified here will limit the development of highly mutated VOC in typical transmission chains, adding to the evidence that selection over prolonged infections in immunocompromised patients may drive their evolution.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of the pulmonary ailment, tuberculosis (TB), continues to thrive owing to a disorganized immune response against it by the host. Among other factors, the rewiring of distinct host signaling pathways is effectuated by the intracellular bacterium, resulting in pathogen-favorable outcomes. Oxidative stress build-up is a key cellular manifestation that occurs during mycobacterial infection. Enhanced oxidative stress is brought about by the cumulative effect of elevated reactive oxygen species generation as well as the inept ability of the cell to mitigate ROS levels. Here, we report the increased expression of the neuronal ligand, SLIT2, during mycobacterial infection in macrophages. By employing loss of function analysis using specific inhibitors, we attribute the heightened expression of SLIT2 to the Mtb-mediated phosphorylation of the p38/JNK pathways. Also, using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis, we found reduced levels of the repressive H3K27me3 signature on the Slit2 promoter during mycobacterial infection. Furthermore, SLIT2 was found to promote the expression of cellular pantetheinase, Vanin1 (VNN1), that contributed to copious levels of ROS within the macrophage cellular milieu. Thus, we dissect essential molecular details leading to the robust expression of SLIT2 during Mtb infection while outlining the potential consequences of SLIT2 upregulation in infected macrophages.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=143 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/512188v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@352ec6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19209e5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c7c546org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@168ab61_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We generated chimeric recombinant SARS-CoV-2 encoding the S gene of Omicron in the backbone of an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 isolate and compared this virus with the naturally circulating Omicron variant. The Omicron S-bearing virus robustly escapes vaccine-induced humoral immunity, mainly due to mutations in the receptor-binding motif (RBM), yet unlike naturally occurring Omicron, efficiently replicates in cell lines and primary-like distal lung cells. In K18-hACE2 mice, while Omicron causes mild, non-fatal infection, the Omicron S-carrying virus inflicts severe disease with a mortality rate of 80%. This indicates that while the vaccine escape of Omicron is defined by mutations in S, major determinants of viral pathogenicity reside outside of S.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes prophage {phi}1207.3 (formerly Tn1207.3) carries the mef(A)-msr(D) efflux resistance genes, responsible for type M macrolide resistance. To investigate if {phi}1207.3 is a functional bacteriophage, we transferred the element from the original S. pyogenes host in a prophage-free and competence-deficient S. pneumoniae strain. Pneumococcal cultures of the {phi}1207.3-carrying lysogen were treated with mitomycin C to assess if {phi}1207.3 enters the lytic cycle. Mitomycin C induced a limited phage burst and a growth impairment resulting in early entrance in the stationary phase. To determine if {phi}1207.3 is able to produce mature phage particles we prepared concentrated supernatants recovered from a mitomycin C induced pneumococcal culture by sequential centrifugation and ultracentrifugation steps. Negative staining Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) of supernatants revealed the presence of phage particles with an icosahedral, electron dense capsid and a long, non-contractile tail, typical of a siphovirus. Quantification of {phi}1207.3 was performed by qPCR and semi-quantitatively by TEM. PCR quantified 3.34 x 104 and 6.06 x 104 excised forms of phage genome per ml of supernatant obtained from the untreated and mitomycin C treated cultures, respectively. By TEM, we estimated 3.02 x 103 and 7.68 x 103 phage particles per ml of supernatant. The phage preparations of {phi}1207.3 infected and lysogenised pneumococcal recipient strains at a frequency of 7.5 x 10-6 lysogens/recipient, but did not show sufficient lytic activity to form plaques. Phage lysogenisation efficiently occurred after 30 minutes of contact of the phages with the recipient cells and required a minimum of 103 phage particles.\n\nImportanceBacteriophages play an important role in bacterial physiology and genome evolution. The widespread use of genome sequencing revealed that bacterial genomes can contain several different integrated temperate bacteriophages, which can constitute up to 20% of the genome. Most of these bacteriophages are only predicted in silico and never shown to be functional. In fact, it is often difficult to induce the lytic cycle of temperate bacteriophages. In this work, we show that {phi}1207.3, a peculiar bacteriophage originally from Streptococcus pyogenes, which can lysogenise different Streptococci and carries the macrolide resistance mef(A)-msr(D) gene pair, is capable of producing mature virions, but only at a low level, while not being able to produce plaques. This temperate phage is probably a partially functional phage, which seems to have lost lytic characteristics to specialize into lysogenisation. While we are not used to conceive phages separately from lysis, this behavior could actually be more frequent than expected.",

    "abstract": "ComRS quorum-sensing systems regulate competence and bacteriocin production in the mutans streptococci that cause dental caries (tooth decay). We recently discovered a new class of ComRS (Type IV) in the oral pathogen Streptococcus sobrinus. We now show that every species of mutans streptococci has at least one Type IV ComRS system. S. mutans, S. ratti, S. macacae, and S. ferus have both a Type II and a Type IV ComRS system; S. criceti has one Type IV ComRS system; and S. downei and S. sobrinus have two Type IV ComRS systems. Gene deletion and reporter assays reveal that, in general, competence is regulated by one ComRS system, while a second ComRS system--when present--regulates bacteriocin production. However, crosstalk in species with two ComRS systems leads to a diverse set of competence/bacteriocin network structures. In S. mutans, for example, the Type IV ComRS can potentiate competence by kickstarting the well-studied Type II system, while the Type II system shows spillover activation of the Type IV system. Differences in ComR DNA binding sequences determine the specificity of the ComR paralogs, and sometimes a single base pair change can integrate the two systems. Our work reveals similarities and differences among the competence/bacteriocin networks in naturally competent streptococci, suggesting that paralogous regulation may provide evolutionary flexibility in genetic networks.",

    "abstract": "Microbial Induced Calcite Precipitation (MICP) offers a host of interesting features, both from theoretical and practical standpoints. This process was firstly investigated as a geo-biological mechanism involved in carbonate mineral formation both in rocks and soil. The interest towards its practical use significantly increased in the recent years, as MICP was used in different fields, such as oil recovery, improvement of soil geotechnical characteristics and concreate healing. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to carry out a bibliometric descriptive study of publications on MICP. We analyzed data from the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), which provides comprehensive information for bibliometric analysis, including the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCI-E) and the Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI). The bibliometric analysis was carried out on 1580 publications, from 2000 to August 2022, and included publication output, author, institution, country, collaborations between authors, institutes and countries, and citation frequency. We created visualization maps including research collaborations by using the VOSviewer program. MICP, carbonate precipitation, cementation, and soil improvement in terms of geotechnical properties are high-frequency used keywords. Although in the year 2000 only two papers were published on MICP, the number of publications increased rapidly since 2014. In 2021, 333 papers were published. China leads as the most productive country, followed by USA and Australia. According to our results, the number of research papers dramatically increased in the last 5 years. MICP with concrete healing/cementation, soil geotechnical improvement, and the low environmental impact of such a technique are becoming very popular topics among researchers. With the ageing of concrete buildings, as well as with the worsening of environmental pollution and soil alterations, the research about MICP will play an ever increasing and crucial role in civil engineering and geotechnical issues and in soil science. Nevertheless, our study pointed out a sort of concentration of the MICP studies in few countries. Russia and Brazil, for instance, seems to poorly contribute to MICP researches. A larger cooperation among countries, together with the extension of the research network on this topic, would considerably foster the progress in MICP studies, from both practical and speculative standpoints.",

The characterization of the viral communities of bats was then prioritized, but despite increasing efforts, there are large disparities in the geographical ranges covered and the methodologies employed around the world. As a result, large gaps remain in our current understanding of bat viromes and their role in disease emergence. This is particularly true for megadiverse regions in Latin America. This review aims to summarize the current understanding about bat-viruses that inhabit Brazilian biomes, one of the most bat species-rich and diverse regions of the globe. Taking into account all known bat-associated viral families studied in Brazilian biomes, we found that almost half of all bat species (86/181 species) were not investigated for viruses at all. Moreover, only a small fraction of viral lineages or families have been studied more in depth, usually employing targeted methods with limited power to characterize a broad virus diversity. Additionally, these studies relied on limited spatio-temporal sampling and small sample sizes. Therefore, our current understanding of bat viral communities in the Brazilian biomes is limited and biased at different levels, limiting zoonotic risk assessments of bat-borne viruses. Considering these limitations, we propose strategies to bridge the existing gaps in the near future.",

    "abstract": "The complex life cycle of Plasmodium falciparum requires coordinated gene expression regulation to allow host cell invasion, transmission, and immune evasion. However, this cascade of transcripts is unlikely to be regulated by the limited number of identified parasite-specific transcription factors. Increasing evidence now suggests a major role for epigenetic mechanisms in gene expression in the parasite. In eukaryotes, many lncRNAs have been identified and shown to be pivotal regulators of genome structure and gene expression. To investigate the regulatory roles of lncRNAs in P. falciparum we explored the intergenic lncRNA distribution in nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular locations. Using nascent RNA expression profiles, we identified a total of 1,768 lncRNAs, of which 58% were identified as novel lncRNAs in P. falciparum. The subcellular localization and stage-specific expression of several putative lncRNAs were validated using RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH). Additionally, the genome-wide occupancy of several candidate nuclear lncRNAs was explored using Chromatin Isolation by RNA Purification (ChIRP). ChIRP-seq of candidate lncRNAs revealed that lncRNA occupancy sites within the parasite genome are focal and sequence-specific with a particular enrichment for several parasite-specific gene families, including those involved in pathogenesis, erythrocyte remodeling, and regulation of sexual differentiation. We further validated the function of one specific lncRNA (lncRNA-ch14) using the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing tool. Genomic and phenotypic analysis of the {bigtriangleup}lncRNA-ch14 line demonstrated the importance of this lncRNA in sexual differentiation and sexual reproduction. Our findings bring a new level of insight into the role of lncRNAs in pathogenicity, gene regulation and sexual differentiation. These findings also open new avenues for targeted approaches towards therapeutic strategies against the deadly malaria parasite.",

    "abstract": "Several pyridine derivatives including the pesticide nitrapyrin [2-chloro-6-(trichloromethyl) pyridine] are strong inhibitors of methane monooxygenase, a key enzyme of aerobic methane (CH4) oxidation. In this study we examined the effects of 2-chloro-6-methylpyridine (2C6MP) concentration on aerobic CH4 oxidation and the development of populations of putative methanotrophs in sediment from Old Woman Creek, a freshwater estuary in Huron Co., Ohio. Experimental systems were prepared in serum bottles containing minimal medium with a headspace containing 20% O2 and 10% CH4. The microcosms were spiked with 2C6MP to achieve concentrations of 0, 0.1, 1, or 10 mM and inoculated with sediment. When headspace CH4 concentrations decreased from 10% to < 2%, subsamples were taken for DNA extraction and sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. There was minimal effect of 2C6MP on CH4 oxidation at concentrations of 0.1, and 1 mM, but complete inhibition for > 20 months was observed at 10 mM. ANOSIM of weighted UniFrac distances between groups of triplicate samples supported a primary distinction of the inoculum relative to the enrichments (R=0.999) and a secondary distinction between bottles containing 2C6MP versus those without (R=0.464 [0.1 mM]; R=0.894 [1 mM]). The inoculum was dominated by members of the Proteobacteria (49.9{+/-}1.5%), and to a lesser extent by Bacteroidetes (8.8{+/-}0.2%), Acidobacteria (8.9{+/-}0.4%), and Verrucomicrobia (4.4{+/-}0.3%). In enrichments with or without 2C6MP, Proteobacteria expanded to comprise 65-70% of the total. In the absence of inhibitor, members of the Methylococcaceae and Methylophilaceae increased in relative abundance from < 0.1% of the inoculum to 8.5{+/-}1.0% and 13.4{+/-}2.3%, of the total community respectively. At both 0.1 and 1 mM concentrations of the inhibitor, the Methylococcaceae were much less abundant, representing 3.3{+/-}0.5% and 2.8{+/-}3.3% respectively. No inhibition of the Methylophilaceae was seen at the lower concentration of 2C6MP, but at the higher concentration this taxon was only 7.8{+/-}1.1% of the total. In contrast, members of the Crenotrichaceae, another group of methane oxidizers, increased in relative abundance with greater amounts of inhibitor, representing 8.6{+/-}3.6% of the total at 0.1 mM and 12.0{+/-}4.5% at 1 mM, compared to only 4.1{+/-}0.4% when no inhibitor was present. These results clearly show changes in the populations of putative aerobic methanotrophs relative to the amount of 2C6MP present.",

We performed detailed functional reconstructions that clearly indicated \"late\" and parallel evolution of obligate host-association and intracellularity in different Rickettsiales lineages. According to the depicted scenario, multiple independent series of horizontal acquisitions of transporters led to the progressive loss of biosynthesis of nucleotides, amino acids and other metabolites, producing distinct conditions of host-dependence.

A canonical example is P-glycoprotein (P-gp), an efflux transporter that controls the intestinal absorption of diverse compounds. Despite reports that P-gp expression depends on the microbiome, the mechanisms responsible and their physiological relevance remain unclear. Surprisingly, we found that the cardiac drug-metabolizing gut Actinobacterium Eggerthella lenta increases drug absorption in mice through post-translational inhibition of P-gp ATPase efflux activity. P-gp inhibition is conserved in the Eggerthellaceae family but absent in other Actinobacteria. Comparative genomics identified genes associated with P-gp inhibition. Finally, activity-guided biochemical fractionation coupled to metabolomics identified a cluster of isoflavonoids produced by E. lenta related to plant-derived P-gp inhibitors. These results highlight the unexpected overlap between diet- and microbiome-derived compounds, and the importance of considering the broader relevance of the gut microbiome for drug disposition beyond first-pass metabolism.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThe gut bacterium Eggerthella lenta secretes inhibitors of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity, accelerating drug absorption.",

    "abstract": "Aspergillus fungi contain -1,3-glucan with a low proportion of -1,4-glucan as a major cell wall polysaccharide. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored -amylases are conserved in Aspergillus fungi. The GPI-anchored -amylase AmyD in Aspergillus nidulans has been reported to directly suppress the biosynthesis of cell wall -1,3-glucan but not to degrade it in vivo. However, the detailed mechanism of cell wall -1,3-glucan biosynthesis regulation by AmyD remains unclear. Here we focused on AoAgtA, which is encoded by the Aspergillus oryzae agtA gene, an ortholog of the A. nidulans amyD gene. Similar to findings in A. nidulans, agtA overexpression in A. oryzae grown in submerged culture decreased the amount of cell wall -1,3-glucan and led to the formation of smaller hyphal pellets in comparison with the wild-type strain. We analyzed the enzymatic properties of recombinant (r)AoAgtA produced in Pichia pastoris and found that it degraded soluble starch, but not linear bacterial -1,3-glucan. Furthermore, rAoAgtA cleaved 3--maltotetraosylglucose with a structure similar to the predicted boundary structure between the -1,3-glucan main chain and a short spacer composed of -1,4-linked glucose residues in cell wall -1,3-glucan. Interestingly, rAoAgtA randomly cleaved only the -1,4-glycosidic bonds of 3--maltotetraosylglucose, indicating that AoAgtA may cleave the spacer in cell wall -1,3-glucan. Consistent with this hypothesis, heterologous overexpression of agtA in A. nidulans decreased the molecular weight (MW) of cell wall -1,3-glucan. These in vitro and in vivo properties of AoAgtA suggest that GPI-anchored -amylases can degrade the spacer -1,4-glycosidic linkages in cell wall -1,3-glucan before its insolubilization, and this spacer cleavage decreases the MW of cell wall -1,3-glucan in vivo.",

For Fusarium oxysporum, sporodochia are known to produce airborne conidia and enhance the dissemination of this otherwise soilborne pathogen. Sporodochia are small and transient, and they are documented for only a few formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum. This study reports airborne conidia and sporodochia produced by F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae, the cause of Fusarium wilt of strawberry, in the Monterey Bay region of California. Sporodochia were consistently present in Fusarium wilt-afflicted strawberry fields and were discovered in 21 of 24 Fusarium wilt-diseased fields. Only necrotic tissues were observed bearing sporodochia, and they were most frequently observed on petioles and peduncles. Sporodochia grew significantly longer up peduncles than petioles, extending further away from the base of the plant and toward parts of the canopy more exposed to wind. A stolon hosted the longest stretch of sporodochial growth, found covering the stolons entire 35 cm length and also the base of the daughter plant. Macroconidia were produced by all sporodochia samples, and we did not find microconidia on any samples. An initial series of experiments confirmed the potential for conidia produced by sporodochia to disperse with wind over short distances. The prevalence of sporodochia producing airborne spores of F. oxysporum f. sp. fragariae has great importance for disease management and biosecurity.",

Interestingly, several of these candidate mTOR substrates are involved in various aspects of RNA biology, including regulating stability and processing. We characterized in-depth one of the validated mTOR substrates, LARP1, an RNA binding protein. mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of LARP1 is nutrient-sensitive and controls the RNA-binding ability of LARP1.

    "abstract": "Polycomb group (PcG) proteins modulate higher-order genome folding and play a critical role in silencing transcription during development. It is commonly proposed that PcG dependent changes in genome folding, which compact chromatin, contribute directly to repression by blocking binding of activating complexes and demixing repressed targets from non-repressed chromatin. To test this model we utilized Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA) to trace the 3-dimensional folding of the Hoxa gene cluster, a canonical Polycomb target, allowing us to analyze thousands of DNA traces in single cells. In cell types ranging from embryonic stem cells to brain tissue, we find that PcG-bound chromatin frequently explores decompact states and partial mixing with neighboring chromatin, while remaining uniformly repressed, challenging the repression-by-compaction model. Using polymer physics simulations, we show that the flexible ensembles we observe can be explained by dynamic contacts mediated by multivalent interactions that are too weak to induce phase separation. Instead, these transient contacts contribute to accurate propagation of the epigenetic state without ectopic spreading or gradual erosion. We propose that the distinctive 3D organization of Polycomb chromatin, reflects a mechanism of \"spatial feedback\" required for stable repression.",

    "abstract": "The transcription factor GATA3 plays a critical role in the development of neurons and sensory epithelia of the inner ear. In mouse cochleae, GATA3 is downregulated in certain supporting cells (SCs) and in type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) after development. This reduction of GATA3 in SCs severely limits Atoh1-induced hair cell (HC) regeneration and suggests that a similar downregulation in human cochleae may be limiting for regenerative therapies. However, it is unknown whether GATA3 is similarly or differentially regulated in primates versus rodents. Using CAGE-seq data, we compared over 40 putative GATA3 regulatory elements across species and found both conserved and non-conserved sequences. To assess whether cochlear GATA3 distribution is similar or different between rodents and primates, we immunostained cochleae from mice, rats, macaques, and humans using antibodies raised against highly conserved GATA3 peptide sequences. GATA3 immunostaining in the organs of Corti from all four species revealed a large degree of conservation, where SCs medial and lateral to cochlear HCs exhibited robust nuclear GATA3 immunolabeling, but pillar and Deiters cells had significantly reduced GATA3 immunoreactivity. In all four species, GATA3 was expressed in a subset of SGNs that largely co-expressed peripherin suggesting they were type II SGNs. Only one difference emerged, wherein human cochlear inner hair cells were not GATA3 immunoreactive despite being so in the other species. Overall, the pattern of GATA3 expression in primates appears similar to rodents and reinforces the notion that ATOH1 mediated regenerative therapies may be limited by reduced GATA3 expression in adult SCs.",

    "abstract": "Despite the high conservation of minor introns across eukaryotic supergroups, specific lineages have completely lost minor intron splicing, which has raised questions about their evolution and purpose. Addressing these questions requires identification of the introns that are affected by minor spliceosome inhibition. To this end, we applied principles of Linnaean taxonomy combined with position-weight matrices to produce five intron classes: minor, minor-like, hybrid, major-like and major. We classified introns across the genomes of 263 species of six eukaryotic supergroups, which can be viewed at the Minor Intron Database (MIDB). Transcriptomic analysis revealed that [~]40% of the minor introns are responsive to minor spliceosome inhibition, while an additional 5% of the minor-like and hybrid introns are also affected. We propose that minor-like introns represent an intermediate in the conversion of minor to major introns and uncover the importance of a guanine at the -1 position of the 5 splice site in facilitating this shift in spliceosome dependence. Finally, we find that minor introns are aberrantly spliced in fish and plants upon cold stress, thereby providing a potential explanation for their high degree of conservation in these lineages.",

We found motifs for enolase N-terminal, enolase C-terminal, magnesium binding site, and several phosphorylation sites such as casein kinase II phosphorylation, protein kinase C phosphorylation, and tyrosine kinase phosphorylation. RT-PCR showed enolase mRNA present in all developmental stages and most of the vital organelles of H. longicornis. Notably, a higher transcript level was observed in synganglia compared with other areas based on real-time PCR, indicating that the role of enolase in the tick salivary gland is controlled by nerves arising in the synganglion. The functional status of enolase was characterized using RNA interference (RNAi) and caused significant (P < 0.05) reduction in feeding and reproduction as well as an abnormality in eggs and hatching. Taken together, these results indicate enolase as an important candidate for multiple vaccine antigens for controlling the tick population.\n\nSummary StatementWe identified enolase in Haemaphysalis longicornis ticks in Jeju strain which has crucial role during blood engorgement, feeding duration, egg hatching, embryonic development physiological changes.",
