    "abstract": "Integration and segregation are two fundamental principles of brain organization. The brain manages the transitions and balance between different functional segregated or integrated states through neuromodulatory systems. Recently, computational and experimental studies suggest a pro-segregation effect of cholinergic neuromodulation. Here, we studied the effects of the cholinergic system on brain functional connectivity using both empirical fMRI data and computational modeling. First, we analyzed the effects of nicotine on functional connectivity and network topology in healthy subjects during resting-state conditions and during an attentional task. Then, we employed a whole-brain neural mass model interconnected using a human connectome to simulate the effects of nicotine and investigate causal mechanisms for these changes. The drug effect was modeled decreasing both the global coupling and local feedback inhibition parameters, consistent with the known cellular effects of acetylcholine. We found that nicotine incremented functional segregation in both empirical and simulated data, and the effects are context-dependent: observed during the task, but not in the resting state. In-task performance correlates with functional segregation, establishing a link between functional network topology and behavior. Furthermore, we found in the empirical data that the regional density of the nicotinic acetylcholine 4{beta}2 correlates with the decrease in functional nodal strength by nicotine during the task. Our results confirm that cholinergic neuromodulation promotes functional segregation in a context-dependent fashion, and suggest that this segregation is suited for simple visual-attentional tasks.",

    "abstract": "A subset of circular RNAs (circRNAs) and linear RNAs have been proposed to \"sponge\" or block microRNA activity. Additionally, certain RNAs induce microRNA destruction through the process of Target RNA-Directed MicroRNA Degradation (TDMD), but whether both linear and circular transcripts are equivalent in driving TDMD is unknown. Here we study whether circular/linear topology of endogenous and artificial RNA targets affects TDMD. Consistent with previous knowledge that Cdr1as (ciRS-7) circular RNA protects miR-7 from Cyrano-mediated TDMD, we demonstrate that depletion of Cdr1as reduces miR-7 abundance. In contrast, overexpression of an artificial linear version of Cdr1as drives miR-7 degradation. Using plasmids that express a circRNA with minimal co-expressed cognate linear RNA, we show differential effects on TDMD that cannot be attributed to the nucleotide sequence, as the TDMD properties of a sequence often differ between its circular and linear forms. By analysing RNA sequencing data of a neuron differentiation system, we further detect potential effects of circRNAs on microRNA stability. Our results support the view that RNA circularity influences TDMD, either enhancing or inhibiting it on specific microRNAs.",

    "abstract": "Problem-solving and reasoning involve mental exploration and navigation in sparse relational spaces. A physical analogue is spatial navigation in structured environments such as a network of burrows. Recent experiments with mice navigating a labyrinth show a sharp discontinuity during learning, corresponding to a distinct moment of  sudden insight when mice figure out long, direct paths to the goal. This discontinuity is seemingly at odds with reinforcement learning (RL), which involves a gradual build-up of a value signal during learning. Here, we show that biologically-plausible RL rules combined with persistent exploration generically exhibit discontinuous learning. In tree-like structured environments, positive feedback from learning on behavior generates a  reinforcement wave with a steep profile. The discontinuity occurs when the wave reaches the starting point. By examining the nonlinear dynamics of reinforcement propagation, we establish a quantitative relationship between the learning rule, the agents exploration biases and learning speed. Predictions explain existing data and motivate specific experiments to isolate the phenomenon. Additionally, we characterize the exact learning dynamics of various RL rules for a complex sequential task.",

    "abstract": "Cargo transport by molecular motors along microtubules is essential for the function of eucaryotic cells, in particular neurons in which axonal transport defects constitute the early pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases. Mainly studied in motor and sensory neurons, axonal transport is still difficult to characterize in neurons of the brain in absence of appropriate in vivo tools. Here, we measured fast axonal transport by tracing the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) nanocrystals endocytosed by brain neurons of zebrafish (Zf) larvae. Thanks to the optical translucency of Zf larvae and of the perfect photostability of nanoKTP SHG, we achieved a high scanning speed of 20 frames (of {approx} 90 mx60 m size) per second in Zf brain. We focused our study on endolysosomal vesicle transport in axons of known polarization, separately analyzing kinesin and dynein motor-driven displacements. To validate our assay, we used either loss-of-function mutations of dynein or kinesin 1 or the dynein inhibitor dynapyrazole, and quantified several transport parameters. We successfully demonstrated that dynapyrazole reduces nanoKTP mobile fraction and retrograde run length consistently, while the retrograde run length increased in kinesin 1 mutants. Taking advantage of nanoKTP SHG directional emission, we also quantified fluctuations of vesicle orientation. Thus, by combining endocytosis of nanocrystals having non-linear response, fast two-photon microscopy, and high-throughput analysis, we are able to finely monitor fast axonal transport in vivo in the brain of a vertebrate, and reveal subtle axonal transport alterations. The high spatiotemporal resolution achieved in our model may be relevant to precisely investigate axonal transport impairment associated to disease models.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic traits are often constrained in their evolution by the genetic and developmental map underlying them. However, the extent to which these constraints themselves evolve has not been well-characterized. Traits that are integrated are generally thought to be constrained in their ability to evolve because their shared developmental and genetic architecture causes any change in one to be mirrored in the other. Nevertheless, it is not yet clear whether correlations can constrain major episodes of phenotypic diversification over longer timescales. We reconstruct patterns in integration within nine primate lineages and model the evolution of the resulting modules in a phylogenetic context. We find that patterns in integration are generally evolvable across lineages, with apes displaying particular lability in the composition of morphological modules. This increased turnover in module composition corresponds to both divergent evolution of skeletal shape and the formation of novel complexes of locomotor behaviors and postures. While integration may play a role in constraining evolutionary innovation, its effects are dynamic, shifting as the structure of integration itself evolves during episodes of exceptional ecomorphological diversification.",

    "abstract": "Cells possess functional diversity hierarchically. However, most single-cell analyses neglect the nested structures while detecting and visualizing the functional diversity. Here, we incorporate cell hierarchy to study functional diversity at subpopulation, club (i.e., sub-subpopulation), and cell layers. Accordingly, we implement a package, SEAT, to construct cell hierarchies utilizing structure entropy by minimizing the global uncertainty in cell-cell graphs. With cell hierarchies, SEAT deciphers functional diversity in 36 datasets covering scRNA, scDNA, scATAC, and scRNA-scATAC multiome. First, SEAT finds optimal cell subpopulations with high clustering accuracy. It identifies cell types or fates from omics profiles and boosts accuracy from 0.34 to 1. Second, SEAT detects insightful functional diversity among cell clubs. The hierarchy of breast cancer cells reveals that the specific tumor cell club drives AREG-EGFT signaling. We identify a dense co-accessibility network of cis-regulatory elements specified by one cell club in GM12878. Third, the cell order from the hierarchy infers periodic pseudo-time of cells, improving accuracy from 0.79 to 0.89. Moreover, we incorporate cell hierarchy layers as prior knowledge to refine nonlinear dimension reduction, enabling us to visualize hierarchical cell layouts in low-dimensional space.",

    "abstract": "Biodiversity conservation and human well-being are tightly interlinked; yet mismatches in the scale at which both priorities are planned and implemented have exacerbated biodiversity loss, erosion of ecosystem services, and declining human quality of life. India houses the second largest human population on the planet, while <5% of the countrys land area is effectively protected for conservation. This warrants landscape-level conservation planning through a judicious mix of land-sharing and land-sparing approaches, and co-production of ecosystem services. Through a multi-faceted assessment, we prioritize spatial extents of land parcels that, in the face of anthropogenic threats, can safeguard conservation landscapes across Indias biogeographic zones. We find that only a fraction (~15%) of such priority areas identified here are encompassed under Indias extant PA network, and several landscapes of high importance were omitted in all previous global-scale assessments. We then examined the spatial congruence of priority areas with administrative units earmarked for economic development by the Indian government, and propose management-zoning through state-driven and participatory approaches. Our spatially explicit insights can help meet the twin goals of biodiversity conservation and sustainable development in India and other countries across the Global South.",

    "abstract": "Globular bushy cells (GBCs) of the cochlear nucleus play central roles in the temporal processing of sound. Despite investigation over many decades, fundamental questions remain about their dendrite structure, afferent innervation, and integration of synaptic inputs. Here, we use volume electron microscopy (EM) to construct synaptic maps that precisely specify convergence ratios and synaptic weights for auditory- nerve innervation and accurate surface areas of all postsynaptic compartments. Detailed biophysically-based compartmental models can help develop hypotheses regarding how GBCs integrate inputs to yield their recorded responses to sound. We established a pipeline to export a precise reconstruction of auditory nerve axons and their endbulb terminals together with high-resolution dendrite, soma, and axon reconstructions into biophysically-detailed compartmental models that could be activated by a standard cochlear transduction model. With these constraints, the models predict auditory nerve input profiles whereby all endbulbs onto a GBC are subthreshold (coincidence detection mode), or one or two inputs are suprathreshold (mixed mode). The models also predict the relative importance of dendrite geometry, soma size, and axon initial segment length in setting action potential threshold and generating heterogeneity in sound-evoked responses, and thereby propose mechanisms by which GBCs may homeostatically adjust their excitability. Volume EM also reveals new dendritic structures and dendrites that lack innervation. This framework defines a pathway from subcellular morphology to synaptic connectivity, and facilitates investigation into the roles of specific cellular features in sound encoding. We also clarify the need for new experimental measurements to provide missing cellular parameters, and predict responses to sound for further in vivo studies, thereby serving as a template for investigation of other neuron classes.",

The set of all EFMs in a metabolic network tends to be very large and may have exponential size in the number of reactions. Hence, there is a need to elucidate the structure of this set. Here we focus on geometric properties of EFMs. We analyze the distribution of EFMs in the face lattice of the steady-state flux cone of the metabolic network and show that EFMs in the relative interior of the cone occur only in very special cases. As a measure of complexity, we introduce the concept of the degree of an EFM, which is the dimension of the inclusionwise minimal face containing it. Geometric analysis can help to better understand the structure of the set of EFMs, which is important from both the mathematical and the biological viewpoint.",

Recent experimental and numerical results suggest that these changes could leverage on the coexistence of nematic and hexatic orientational order at different length scales. How this multiscale organization is affected by the material properties of the cells and their substrate is presently unknown. In this study, we address these questions in monolayers of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells having various cell densities and molecular repertoires. At small length scales, confluent monolayers are characterized by a prominent hexatic order, independent of the presence of E-cadherin, monolayer density, and underlying substrate stiffness. However, all three properties affect the meso-scale tissue organization. The length scale at which hexatic order transits to nematic order, the \"hexanematic\" crossover scale, strongly depends on cell-cell adhesions and correlates with monolayer density. Our study demonstrates how epithelial organization is affected by mechanical properties, and provides a robust description of tissue organization during developmental processes.",

While the emergence of innovative technologies has fostered numerous studies in breast cancer, many lack statistical power due to the small sample sizes generally involved. In this study, we present a novel meta-analysis that identifies a common pattern of DNA methylation in all breast cancer subtypes. We obtained DNA methylation signatures at the gene and biological function level, identifying those significant groups of genes and functional pathways affected. To achieve this, we conducted a thorough systematic review following PRISMA statement guidelines for the selection of studies on DNA methylation in breast cancer. In total, we gathered four studies (GSE52865, GSE141338, GSE59901 and GSE101443) that were split into 13 comparisons comprising a set of 144 individuals. We discovered that most breast cancer subtypes share a significant deregulation in the immune system and alterations to the cell cycle. This integrative approach combines all available information from public data repositories and possesses greater statistical power than any individual study. Further evaluations of the identified differential biological processes and pathways may support the identification of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets.\n\nSimple summaryThe identification of DNA methylation patterns in breast cancer represents a potentially valuable approach in defining more accurate diagnoses and treatment options. In this study, we applied a novel methodology that integrates the DNA methylation profiles of all studies available in public repositories via systematic review and meta-analysis. The results provide evidence of a common DNA methylation signature in distinct breast cancer subtypes, which reflects a significant deregulation of the immune system and alterations to the cell cycle.

Here, we aim to clarify the regulatory mechanisms and circulatory pathways of adventitial ISF, which may be a novel systemic circulation distinguished from blood circulation. By fluorescent imaging and speckle tracking velocimetry to record the femoral adventitial ISF, the adventitial ISF flow was found to be regulated by heartbeat and respiration. Under physiological conditions, the ISF flow rate decreased when the heart rate reduced, increased when breath was holding, and a pulsed ISF flow occurred during heavy breathing. During cardiac or respiratory cycle, it was showed that each dilation or contraction of the heart and lungs can generate a to-and-fro motion of the adventitial ISF along the femoral veins. By real-time fluorescent imaging and spectral micro-CT to display the adventitial ISF circulatory pathways, it was found that the heart and lungs work together to regulate the adventitial ISF to flow centripetally along the major arteries and veins of the systemic vasculature into the myocardium, then into the lungs via the pulmonary arteries and return to the heart via the pulmonary veins, forming an adventitial ISF circulation. Functionally, the adventitial ISF circulatory pathway is a promising novel route for organ-targeted extravascular drug delivery.",

    "abstract": "The mosquito, Aedes aegypti, is highly anthropophilic and continues to transmit debilitating arboviruses within human populations. Female mosquitoes are attracted to sources of blood by responding to odor plumes that are emitted by their preferred hosts. Acidic volatile compounds, including carboxylic acids, represent particularly salient odors driving this attraction. Importantly, carboxylic acids are major constituents of human sweat and volatiles generated by skin microbes. As such, they are likely to impact human host preference, which is a dominant factor in disease transmission cycles. A more complete understanding of mosquito host attraction will necessitate the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of volatile odor detection that function in peripheral sensory neurons. Recent studies have shown that members of the variant ionotropic glutamate receptor gene family are necessary for physiological and behavioral responses to acidic volatiles in Aedes. In this study, we have identified a subfamily of variant ionotropic receptors that share sequence homology across several important vector species and are likely to be activated by carboxylic acids. Moreover, we demonstrate that selected members of this subfamily are activated by short chain carboxylic acids in a heterologous cell expression system. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that members of this receptor class underlie acidic volatile sensitivity in vector mosquitoes and provide a frame of reference for future development of novel mosquito attractant and repellent technologies.",

    "abstract": "In cities throughout North America, sightings of coyotes (Canis latrans) have become common. Reports of human-coyote conflict are also rising, as is the public demand for proactive management to prevent negative human-coyote interactions. Effective and proactive management can be informed by the direct observations of community members, who can report their interactions with coyotes and describe the location, time, and context that led to their interactions. To assess the predictors of human-coyote conflict, we used a web-based reporting system to collect 9,134 community-supplied reports of coyotes in Edmonton, Canada, between January 2012 and December 2021. We used a standardized ordinal ranking system to score each report on two indicators of human-coyote conflict: coyote boldness, based on the reported coyote behaviour, and human perceptions about coyotes, determined from the emotions expressed by reporters. We assigned greater conflict scores to behaviours where coyotes followed, approached, charged or contacted pets or people, and to perceptions where reporters expressed fear, worry, concern, discomfort or alarm. Using ordered logistic regression and chi-square tests, we compared conflict scores for each response variable to spatial, temporal and contextual covariates. Our analysis showed that coyotes were bolder in less developed open areas and during the pup rearing season, but human perceptions were most negative in residential areas and during the dispersal season. Reports that mentioned dogs or cats were more likely to describe bolder coyote behaviour, and those that mentioned pets or children had more negative perceptions about coyotes. Coyote boldness and human perceptions both indicated rising human-coyote conflict in Edmonton over the 10 years of reporting.",

    "abstract": "In previous research, miR-148a-3p deficiency was observed in bone malformation in hemifacial microsomia. Nevertheless, the mechanism of miR-148a regulating osteogenesis remains unclear. Herein, in this article, we probed into the role of miR-148a-3p in bone physiology by utilizing miR-148a knock-out (KO) mice. Compared with wild-type (WT) or heterozygotic (HE) littermates, miR-148a knock-out mice manifested lower body weight, bone dysplasia with increased bone mass. Through in-vitro experiments, in terms of miR-148a-3p overexpression (miRNA mimic transfection) and knockout (primary cells from WT and KO littermates), we found that miR-148a-3p can suppress osteogenesis, either in the ALP activity or bone nodules formation. Afterward, by means of proteomics, combined with RNA-sequencing and prediction databases of microRNA targets (miRDB and TargetScan), nine candidate genes targeted by miR-148a-3p were identified. Among them, only Itga11 was regulated by mRNA degradation, while the others were modulated via post-transcriptional inhibition. Based on several online databases (GenePaint, BioGPS, STRING), Integrin Subunit Alpha 11 (Itga11) was suggested to play an essential role in osteogenesis and it was confirmed as one direct target of miR-148a-3p by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Meanwhile, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) indicated activation of PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and WNT signaling pathway in miR-148a KO mice. The thereafter western blot confirmed that PI3K/Akt/GSK3/{beta}-catenin signaling pathway was involved. Finally, with the help of esterase-response bone-affiliative liposome with the Itga11 siRNA delivery system, the enhanced osteogenesis in miR-148a KO mice was partly rescued. Taken together, we demonstrated that miR-148a-3p can inhibit osteogenesis by targeting Itga11 via PI3K/Akt/GSK3/{beta}-catenin pathway.",

    "abstract": "The endopeptidase ADAM10 is a critical catalyst for regulated proteolysis of key drivers of mammalian development and physiology, and for non-amyloidogenic cleavage of the Alzheimers precursor protein as the primary -secretase. ADAM10 function in vivo requires formation of a complex with a C8-tetraspanin protein, with different ADAM10-C8-tetraspanin complexes having distinct substrate selectivity, yet the basis for such selectivity remains elusive. We present here a cryo-EM structure of a vFab-ADAM10-Tspan15 complex, which shows that Tspan15 binding relieves ADAM10 autoinhibition and positions the enzyme active site about 20 [A] from the plasma membrane for membrane-proximal substrate cleavage. Cell-based assays of N-cadherin shedding establish that the positioning of the active site by the interface between the ADAM10 catalytic domain and the bound tetraspanin influences selection of the preferred cleavage site. Together, these studies reveal the molecular mechanism underlying selective ADAM10 proteolysis at membrane-proximal sites and offer a roadmap for its modulation in disease.",

    "abstract": "Store-operated calcium entry (SOCE) contributes to several physiological and pathological conditions including transcription, secretion, immunodeficiencies, and cancer. SOCE has been shown to be important for breast cancer cell migration where knockdown of SOCE components (STIM1 or Orai1) decreases cancer metastasis. Here we show unexpectedly that STIM1 knockout (KO) metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells migrate faster and have enhance invasion capacity compared to parental cells. In contrast, Orai1-KO cells, which have similar levels of SOCE inhibition as STIM1-KO, migrate slower than the parental cell line. This shows that the enhanced migration phenotype of STIM1-KO cells is not due to the loss of a Ca2+ entry through SOCE, rather it involves transcriptional remodeling. Interestingly, NFATC2 is significantly downregulated in STIM1-KO cells and overexpression of NFATC2 reversed the enhanced migration of STIM1-KO cells. This demonstrates that STIM1 modulates NFATC2 expression independently of its role in SOCE.\n\nSUMMARY STATEMENTBreast cancer cells migrate faster when the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 in knocked out due to downregulation of NFAT1 expression independent of Ca2+ influx.",

    "abstract": "Conventional treatment for intervertebral disc herniation alleviates pain but does not repair the annulus fibrosus (AF), resulting in a high incidence of recurrent herniation and persistent disfunction. The lack of repair and the acute inflammation that arise after injury further compromises the disc and can result in disc-wide degeneration in the long term. To address this clinical need, we developed tension-activated repair patches (TARPs) for annular repair and the local delivery of bioactive anti-inflammatory factors. TARPs transmit physiologic strains to mechanically-activated microcapsules (MAMCs) embedded within, which activate and release encapsulated biomolecules in response to physiologic loading. Here, we demonstrate that the TARP design modulates implant biomechanical properties and regulates MAMC mechano-activation. Next, the FDA-approved anti-inflammatory molecule, interleukin 1 receptor antagonist, Anakinra, was loaded in TARPs and the effects of TARP-mediated annular repair and Anakinra delivery was evaluated in a model of annular injury in the goat cervical spine. TARPs showed robust integration with the native tissue and provided structural reinforcement at the injury site that prevented disc-wide aberrant remodeling resulting from AF detensioning. The delivery of Anakinra via TARP implantation improved the retention of disc biochemical composition through increased matrix deposition and retention at the site of annular injury. Anakinra delivery additionally attenuated the inflammatory response associated by scaffold implantation, decreasing osteolysis in adjacent vertebrae and preserving disc cellularity and matrix organization throughout the AF. These results demonstrate the translational and therapeutic potential of this novel TARP system for the treatment of intervertebral disc herniations.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryTension-activated repair patches delivering bioactive anti-inflammatory factors improve healing in an in vivo goat cervical disc injury model.",

    "abstract": "Organisms determine the transcription rates of thousands of genes through a few modes of regulation that recur across the genome. These modes interact with a changing cellular environment to yield highly dynamic expression patterns. In bacteria, the relationship between a genes regulatory architecture and its expression is well understood for individual model gene circuits. However, a broader perspective of these dynamics at the genome-scale is lacking, in part because bacterial transcriptomics have hitherto captured only a static snapshot of expression averaged across millions of cells. As a result, the full diversity of gene expression dynamics and their relation to regulatory architecture remains unknown. Here we present a novel genome-wide classification of regulatory modes based on each genes transcriptional response to its own replication, which we term the Transcription-Replication Interaction Profile (TRIP). We found that the response to the universal perturbation of chromosomal replication integrates biological regulatory factors with biophysical molecular events on the chromosome to reveal a genes local regulatory context. While the TRIPs of many genes conform to a gene dosage-dependent pattern, others diverge in distinct ways, including altered timing or amplitude of expression, and this is shaped by factors such as intra-operon position, repression state, or presence on mobile genetic elements. Our transcriptome analysis also simultaneously captures global properties, such as the rates of replication and transcription, as well as the nestedness of replication patterns. This work challenges previous notions of the drivers of expression heterogeneity within a population of cells, and unearths a previously unseen world of gene transcription dynamics.",

    "abstract": "In human lung cells, the profibrotic cytokine TGF-{beta}1 increases sialidase 3 (NEU3) protein by increasing NEU3 translation without increasing levels of NEU3 mRNA. To elucidate how TGF-{beta}1 regulates translation, we treated human lung fibroblasts (HLF) with TGF-{beta}1 and used proteomics and RNA-seq to determine the effect of TGF-{beta}1 on proteins, mRNAs, and mRNA polysome/monosome ratios. We identified 181 mRNAs where TGF-{beta}1 also increases translation to increase protein levels without significantly affecting mRNA levels. These mRNAs share a common 20 nucleotide motif. Deletion or insertion of this motif in mRNAs eliminates or induces the TGF-{beta}1 regulation of translation. At least 5 RNA-binding proteins including DDX3 bind the RNA motif, and TGF-{beta}1 regulates their protein levels and/or binding to the motif. Inhibiting DDX3, either by siRNA or small molecule inhibitors, reduced TGF-{beta}1 induced NEU3 levels. In the mouse bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis, injections of the DDX3 inhibitor RK-33 starting 10 days after bleomycin potentiated survival and reduced lung inflammation, fibrosis, and lung tissue levels of DDX3, TGF-{beta}1, and NEU3. Together, these results suggest that TGF-{beta}1 regulates RNA-binding proteins that interact with a mRNA motif that is necessary and sufficient for TGF-{beta}1 to regulate mRNA translation, and that blocking this effect can reduce fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the gp41 component of the HIV-1 envelope (Env) are characterized by long hydrophobic heavy-chain complementarity-determining regions (HCDR3s) that interact with MPER and some viral membrane lipids, to achieve increased local concentrations. Here, we show that increasing the local concentration of MPER-directed bnAbs at the cell surface via binding to the high affinity Fc receptor (Fc{gamma}RI) potentiates their ability to prevent viral entry in a manner analogous to the previously reported observation whereby the lipid binding activity of MPER bnAbs increases their concentration at the viral surface membrane. However, binding of MPER-directed bnAb 10E8 to Fc{gamma}RI abolishes the neutralization synergy that is seen with the N-heptad repeat (NHR)-targeting antibody D5_AR and NHR-targeting small molecule enfuvirtide (T20), possibly due to decreased accessibility of the NHR in the Fc{gamma}RI-10E8-MPER complex. Taken together, our results suggest that lipid-binding activity and Fc{gamma}RI-mediated potentiation function in concert to improve the potency of MPER-directed bnAbs by increasing their local concentration near the site of viral fusion. Therefore, lipid-binding may not be a strict requirement for potent neutralization by MPER-targeting bnAbs, as alternative methods can achieve similar increase in local concentration while avoiding potential liabilities associated with immunologic host tolerance.\n\nAuthor summaryThe trimeric glycoprotein Env is the only viral protein expressed on the surface of HIV-1, is the target of broadly neutralizing antibodies, and is the focus of most vaccine development efforts. Broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the membrane proximal external region (MPER) of Env show lipid-binding characteristics and modulating this interaction affects neutralization. In this study, we tested the neutralization potencies of variants of the MPER-targeting antibody 10E8 with different viral membrane-binding and host Fc{gamma}RI-binding capabilities. Our results suggest that binding to both lipid and Fc{gamma}RI improves the neutralization potency of MPER-directed antibodies by concentrating the antibody at sites of viral fusion. As such, lipid-binding may not be uniquely required for MPER-targeting broadly neutralizing antibodies, as alternative methods to increase local concentration can achieve similar improvements in potency.",

Resistances are often due to complex interplays of naturally and acquired resistance mechanisms that are enhanced by its remarkably large regulatory network.\n\nThis study describes the proteomic responses of two carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa strains of high-risk clones ST235 and ST395 to subminimal inhibitory concentrations (sub-MICs) of meropenem by identifying differentially expressed proteins and pathways. Strain CCUG 51971, carries a VIM-4 metallo-{beta}-lactamase or  classical carbapenemase, and strain CCUG 70744 carries no known acquired carbapenem-resistance genes and exhibits  non-classical carbapenem-resistance. Each strain was cultivated with different sub-MICs of meropenem, and analyzed, using quantitative shotgun proteomics, based on tandem mass tag (TMT) isobaric labeling followed by nano-liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry.\n\nExposure of both strains to sub-MICs meropenem resulted in hundreds of differentially expressed proteins, including {beta}-lactamases, proteins associated with transport, peptidoglycan metabolism, cell wall organization, and regulatory proteins. Strain CCUG 51971 showed up-regulation of intrinsic {beta}-lactamases and VIM-4 carbapenemase, while CCUG 70744 exhibited a combination of up-regulated intrinsic {beta}-lactamases, efflux pumps, penicillin-binding proteins and down-regulation of porins. All components of the H1 type VI secretion system were up-regulated in strain CCUG 51971. Enrichment analyses revealed multiple metabolic pathways affected in both strains.\n\nSub-MICs of meropenem cause marked changes in the proteomes of carbapenem-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa exhibiting different resistance mechanisms, involving a wide range of proteins, many uncharacterized, which might play a role in the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to meropenem.",

    "abstract": "Hyperphosphorylated guanosine nucleotide (p)ppGpp, synthesized by Rel proteins, regulates the stringent response pathway responsible for biofilm growth and persister cell formation in the stationary phase of mycobacteria. The discovery of vitamin C as a potent inhibitor of Rel protein activities raises the prospect of such a tetrone lactone to prevent biofilm growth and persister cell formation. The closely related isotetrone lactone derivatives are identified in the present study as potent inhibitors of the above processes in a mycobacterium. Isotetrone lactone derivatives are synthesized from appropriate -ketocarboxylic acids, derived from the a-amino acids. Aldol condensation with formaldehyde, followed by the lactone formation, completes synthesis of isotetrone derivatives, possessing varied substituents at C-4 carbon, in good yields. A series of biochemical evaluations of biofilm growth and persister cell formation in M. smegmatis is conducted. Among the derivatives, isotetrone possessing phenyl substituent at C-4 carbon completely inhibit the biofilm formation at 400 g mL-1 concentration, 84 h of post-exposure, followed by a moderate inhibition by the isotetrone possessing p-hydroxyphenyl substituent. Whereas, the latter isotetrone inhibits the growth of cells at 400 g mL-1 f.c. when monitored for 2 weeks, under PBS starvation condition. Isotetrones also potentiate the inhibition of antibiotic tolerant regrowth of cells by ciprofloxacin antibiotic (0.75 g mL-1) and thus act as bio-enhancers. The combination is shown to significantly arrest the emergence of ciprofloxacin-resistant genetic mutants. The observations suggest that isotetrones in combination with ciprofloxacin are therapeutically superior when administered together. Systematic molecular dynamics studies show that isotetrone derivative binds to Rel protein more efficiently than vitamin C and the binding is aided by hydrogen bonding, van der Waals and electrostatic interactions at a binding site possessing serine, threonine, lysine and arginine residues. The present study establishes that the identified isotetrone derivatives (i) act as inhibitors of M. smegmatis biofilm growth and (ii) arrest the re-emergence of recalcitrant persister cells when administered together with ciprofloxacin antibiotic. Results of this study establish that isotetrones as new chemical entities that interfere with stringent response pathways in a mycobacterium under stress and permit overcoming the multidrug-resistant persister cell emergence in the bacterium.",

While altered virion surface structures had minimal effects on the early interactions with wild type cells, mutation of specific O-glycosylation sites affected glycoprotein surface expression and function. In conclusion, the data demonstrates the importance of specific glycans in a clinically relevant human model of HSV-1 infection and highlights the utility of genetic engineering to elucidate the roles of specific viral and cellular carbohydrate structures.",

    "abstract": "Our understanding of in situ microbial physiology is primarily based on physiological characterization of fast-growing and readily-isolatable microbes. Microbial enrichments to obtain novel isolates with slower growth rates or physiologies adapted to low nutrient environments are plagued by intrinsic biases for fastest-growing species when using standard laboratory isolation protocols. New cultivation tools to minimize these biases and enrich for less well-studied taxa are needed. In this study, we developed a high-throughput bacterial enrichment platform based on single cell encapsulation and growth within double emulsions (GrowMiDE). We showed that GrowMiDE can cultivate many different microorganisms and enrich for novel taxa that are never observed in traditional batch enrichments. For example, preventing dominance of the enrichment by fast-growing microbes due to nutrient privatization within the double emulsion droplets allowed cultivation of novel Negativicutes and Methanobacteria from stool samples in rich media enrichment cultures. In competition experiments between growth rate and growth yield specialist strains, GrowMiDE enrichments prevented competition for shared nutrient pools and enriched for slower-growing but more efficient strains. Finally, we demonstrated the compatibility of GrowMiDE with commercial fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) to obtain isolates from GrowMiDE enrichments. Together, GrowMiDE + DE-FACS is a promising new high-throughput enrichment platform that can be easily applied to diverse microbial enrichments or screens.",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic administration of recombinant proteins has been used for the treatment of various diseases in multiple studies. Herein, we investigated the function of the acute phase protein Orosomucoid 2 (Orm2), which is mainly secreted by hepatocytes, and evaluated its potential as a therapeutic strategy for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We here revealed that a high expression of Orm2 protected mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. The pharmacological administration of recombinant ORM2 protein attenuated hepatic steatosis, inflammation, hepatocyte injury, and fibrosis in mouse livers, which suffered NAFLD and NASH under dietary challenge conditions. Orm2 knockout mice spontaneously underwent obese after 16 weeks under normal diet. Orm2 deficiency exacerbated HFD-induced steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis in mice. Mechanistically, the deletion of Orm2 led to the activation of the Erk1/2-PPAR{gamma}-Cd36 signaling pathway, which in turn increased fatty acid uptake and absorption in hepatocytes and mice. Collectively, our results provide Orm2 is an essential factor for preventing NASH and associated NAFLD under obesity.",

Here, we show that a confined, linear region in Arabidopsis AGO1, the N-coil, is accessible to antibodies preferentially in the RNA-free state of AGO1. Reanalysis of hydrogen-deuterium exchange data on human Ago2 indicates similar structural flexibility of the N-coil depending on small RNA binding. Unloaded Arabidopsis AGO1 interacts with the autophagy cargo receptor ATI1 via direct contact to specific amino acid residues in the N-coil, and mutation of residues required for ATI1 interaction reduces the degradation rate of unloaded AGO1 in vivo.

Membrane localization has been hypothesized to increase intermolecular association rates; however, it has also been argued that association should be faster in the cytosol because membrane diffusion is slow. Here we directly compare an identical association reaction in solution and on supported membranes. The measured rate constants show that for 10 m-radius spherical cell, association is 15-25-fold faster at the membrane than in the cytoplasm. The advantage is cell size-dependent, and for typical ~1 m prokaryotic cells it should be essentially negligible. Rate enhancement is attributable to a combination of closer proximity of the signaling molecule to its targets after translocation and the higher efficiency of a two-dimensional search.",

    "abstract": "Compartment formation in interphase chromosomes is a result of spatial segregation between eu- and heterochromatin on a few mega base pairs (Mbp) scale. On the sub-Mbp scales, Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) appear as interacting domains along the diagonal in the Hi-C contact map (CM). Hi-C experiments showed that most of the TADs vanish upon deleting cohesin, while the compartment structure is maintained and is even enhanced. However, closer inspection of the data reveals that a non-negligible fraction of TADs is preserved (P-TADs) after cohesin loss. Imaging experiments show that, at the single-cell level, TAD-like structures are present even without cohesin. To provide a structural basis for these findings, we used polymer simulations to show that certain TADs with epigenetic mismatches across their boundaries survive after depletion of loops. More importantly, the three-dimensional structures show that many of the P-TADs have sharp physical boundaries. Informed by the simulations, we analyzed the Hi-C maps (with and without cohesin) in mouse liver and HCT-116, which affirmed that epigenetic mismatches and physical boundaries (calculated using the 3D structures) explain the origin of the P-TADs. Single-cell structures, calculated from using only the Hi-C map without any parameters, display TAD-like features in the absence of cohesin that are remarkably similar to the findings in imaging experiments, thus providing a cross validation of the computations. Some P-TADs, with physical boundaries, are relevant to the retention of enhancer-promoter/promoter-promoter interactions. Overall, our study shows that preservation of a subset of TADs upon removing cohesin is a robust phenomenon that is valid across multiple cell lines.",

    "abstract": "Genomic DNA is a crowded track where translocating motor proteins frequently collide. It remains unclear whether these collisions, generally thought to occur inadvertently, carry any physiological function. In this work, we developed a single-molecule assay to directly visualize the trafficking of individual E. coli RNA polymerases (RNAPs) on DNA. This assay enabled us to test the hypothesis that RNAP collisions drive bidirectional transcription termination of convergent gene pairs. We showed that the head-on collision between two converging RNAPs is necessary to prevent transcriptional readthrough, but insufficient to release the collided RNAPs from the DNA. Remarkably, co-directional collision from a trailing RNAP into the head-on collided complex dramatically increases the termination efficiency. Furthermore, a stem-loop structure formed in the nascent RNA is required for collisions to occur at well-defined positions between gene boundaries. These findings, corroborated by transcriptomic data, establish programmed RNAP collisions as an effective strategy to achieve precise gene expression and imply a broader role of genomic conflicts in cell physiology.",

    "abstract": "Protein sequences encode the information necessary for function and folding, however accessing it is not straightforward. Unluckily, although structure and function are tightly linked, the prediction of how specific amino acids contribute to these features is still considerably impaired. Here, we developed PhISCO, Phenotype Inference from Sequence COmparisons, a simple algorithm that finds positions associated with any quantitative phenotype and predicts their values. From a few hundred sequences from four different protein families, we performed multiple sequence alignments and calculated per-position pairwise differences for both the sequence and the observed phenotypes. For the case of Adenylate Kinase we found 3 positions in proximity of the ligand binding sites that are linked to their Optimal Growth Temperature. For microbial rhodopsins, we identified 10 positions close to their chromophore and the lipid-protein interface whose differences are correlated to the maximal absorption wavelength. In the case of myoglobins, 3 positions were identified that have been described as tightly linked to muscular myoglobin concentration. Finally, we identified positions associated with the inhibitory potency of 2 inhibitors of the HIV protease. We showed that strong correlations exist in single positions while an improvement is achieved when the most correlated positions are jointly analyzed. Noteworthy, we performed phenotype predictions using a simple linear model that links perposition divergences of most correlated positions and differences in observed phenotypes. The diversity of the explored systems make PhISCO valuable to find sequence determinants of biological activity modulation and to predict various functional features for uncharacterized members of a protein family.",

Despite of this, the role of NUTD15 in physiology and molecular biology is quite unclear, as well as the mechanism of action of this enzyme. The existence of clinically relevant variants has prompted the study of this enzymes, whose capacity to bound and hydrolyze thioguanine nucleotides is still poor understood. By using a combination of biomolecular modelling techniques together with molecular dynamics we have studied the monomeric wild type NUTD15, as well as two important variants R139C and R139H.

    "abstract": "Microtubule organization in cells is essential for the internal structure and coordination of events of intracellular transport, mitosis, and cell motility. For many cell types, microtubule organization is dominated by centrosomal nucleation that use gamma-tubulin to template filaments. Yet, some cell types lack centrosomes or centrioles, such as plant cells. Instead, microtubules nucleate from regions with high concentrations of microtubule binding and nucleating proteins. A mechanism that can drive high local concentrations of nucleators is liquid-liquid phase separation of proteins with intrinsically disordered regions. Here, we report that the plant microtubule nucleator and crosslinking protein, MAP65-1, can form phase separated condensates at physiological salt and temperature without extra crowding agents. These condensates are liquid at first and can mature to gel-like phases over time and with different environmental conditions. We show that these condensates can nucleate and grow microtubule bundles that form asters, regardless of the viscoelasticity of the condensate. When gel-like droplets nucleate and grow asters from a shell of tubulin at the surface, the microtubules are able to re-fluidize the MAP65 condensate. Condensate-induced cytoskeletal formation could be a universal mechanism for organization of the microtubule and actin cytoskeletons in all cell types, especially cells without centrosomes.",

    "abstract": "Transgenes have been successfully commercialized for qualitatively inherited insect and herbicide resistance traits that show similar effects across genetic backgrounds. However, for quantitative traits like yield, genetic background may affect the measured transgene value. In this paper, we evaluated whether different genetic backgrounds impact the estimated value of a transgene for grain yield, ear height, and anthesis-silking interval for maize by developing isogenic pairs of lines with and without a transgene and testing them in hybrid combination with non-transgenic lines from a complementary heterotic group across eleven environments in the USA. Over all hybrid combinations, the transgene increased yield by 0.2 Mg ha-1. Across multiple non-transgenic lines of the opposing heterotic group, the transgene effect within a line pair ranged from an increase of 0.8 Mg ha-1 for the NSS4 and SS7 transgenic lines to a reduction of 0.3 Mg ha-1 for the NSS5 transgenic line when compared to their non-transgenic isoline. Transgenic hybrids were often taller than non-transgenic hybrids (P<0.05). Anthesis to silking interval was reduced by 4{square}C growing degree units overall, but no transgene x genotype interaction was detected among line pairs. Our results show the importance of testing transgene efficacy across a large sample of elite hybrid pairs to assess the genes value. By only testing in a specific hybrid background, as may be done for qualitative traits like insect resistance, transgenes could be erroneously advanced or eliminated.",

However, testing across multiple genetic backgrounds can be equally important to accurately quantify the value of a transgene for breeding objectives. Creating near-isogenic lines across a wide germplasm space is costly and time consuming, which renders it impractical during early stages of testing. In this experiment, we evaluate three approaches to sample the genetic space while concurrently testing across environments. We created both transgenic and non-transgenic doubled haploid lines, F2:3 lines, and bulk F3 families to determine if all methods resulted in similar estimation of transgene value and to identify the number of yield trial plots from each method necessary to obtain a stable estimate of the transgene value. With one exception, the three methods consistently estimated a similar effect of the transgene. We suggest that bulked F3 lines topcrossed to a tester inbred is the most effective method to estimate the value of a transgene across both genetic space and environments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the plant sciences, results of laboratory studies often do not translate well to the field because lab growth conditions are very different from field conditions. To help close this lab-field gap, we developed a new strategy for studying the wiring of plant traits directly in the field, based on molecular profiling and phenotyping of individual plants of the same genetic background grown in the same field. This single-plant omics strategy leverages uncontrolled micro-environmental variation across the field and stochastic variation among the individual plants as information sources, rather than controlled perturbations. Here, we use single-plant omics on winter-type Brassica napus (rapeseed) plants to investigate to what extent rosette-stage gene expression profiles can be linked to the early and late phenotypes of individual field-grown plants.\n\nResultsWe find that rosette leaf gene expression in autumn has substantial predictive power for both autumnal leaf phenotypes and final yield in spring. Many of the top predictor genes are linked to developmental processes known to occur in autumn in winter-type B. napus accessions, such as the juvenile-to-adult and vegetative-to-reproductive phase transitions, indicating that the yield potential of winter-type B. napus is influenced by autumnal development.\n\nConclusionsOur results show that profiling individual plants under uncontrolled field conditions is a valid strategy for identifying genes and processes influencing crop yield in the field.",

    "abstract": "Sensory difficulties represent a crucial issue in the life of autistic individuals. The diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders describes both hyper- and hypo-responsiveness to sensory stimulation as a criterion for the diagnosis autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Among the sensory domain affected in ASD, altered responses to tactile stimulation represent the most commonly reported sensory deficits. Although tactile abnormalities have been reported in monogenic cohorts of patients and genetic mouse models of ASD, the underlying mechanisms are still unknown. Traditionally, autism research has focused on the central nervous system as the target to infer the neurobiological bases of such tactile abnormalities. Nonetheless, the peripheral nervous system represents the initial site of processing of sensory information and a potential site of dysfunction in the sensory cascade. Here we investigated the gene expression deregulation in the trigeminal ganglion (which directly receives tactile information from whiskers) in two genetic models of syndromic autism (Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice) at both adult and juvenile ages. We found several neuronal and non-neuronal markers involved in inhibitory, excitatory, neuroinflammatory and sensory neurotransmission to be differentially regulated within the trigeminal ganglia of both adult and juvenile Shank3b and Cntnap2 mutant mice. These results may help in entangling the multifaced complexity of sensory abnormalities in autism and open avenues for the development of peripherally targeted treatments for tactile sensory deficits exhibited in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Interferon-{gamma} producing invariant natural killer T (iNKT1) cells are lipid reactive innate-like lymphocytes that are resident in the thymus and peripheral tissues where they protect against pathogenic infection. The thymic functions of iNKT1 cells are not fully elucidated but subsets of thymic iNKT cells modulate CD8 T cell, dendritic cell, B cell and thymic epithelial cell numbers or function. Here we show that a subset of thymic iNKT1 cells require transforming growth factor (TGF)-{beta} induced signals for their development and for expression of residency associated adhesion receptors. Liver and spleen iNKT1 cells do not share this TGF-{beta} gene signature but nonetheless TGF-{beta} is required for optimal liver iNKT1 cell function. Our findings provide insight into the heterogeneity of mechanisms guiding iNKT1 cell development in different tissues and suggest a close association between a subset of iNKT1 cells and TGF-{beta} producing cells in the thymus.",

    "abstract": "Developing universal CARs with improved flexible targeting and controllable activities is urgently needed. While several studies have suggested the potential of CD16a in tandem with monoclonal antibodies to construct universal CAR T cells, the weak affinity between them is one of the limiting factors for efficacy. Herein, we systematically investigated the impact of Fc{gamma} receptor (Fc{gamma}R) affinity on CAR T cells properties by constructing universal CARs using Fc{gamma} receptors with different affinities for IgG1 antibodies, namely CD16a, CD32a, and CD64. We demonstrated that the activities of these universal CAR T cells on tumor cells could be redirected and regulated by IgG1 antibodies. In xenografted mice, 64CAR chimeric Jurkat cells with the highest affinity showed significant antitumor effects in combination with herceptin in the Her2 low expression U251 MG model. However, in the CD20 high expression Raji model, 64CAR caused excessive activation of CAR-T cells, which resulted in cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and the decline of antitumor activity, and 32CAR with a moderate affinity brought the best efficacy. Our work extended the knowledge about Fc{gamma}R-based universal CAR T cells and suggested that only the Fc{gamma}RCAR with an appropriate affinity can offer the optimal antitumor advantages of CAR T cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=82 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/513394v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1348ceorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10eb32org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c12aeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e9c9ea_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Universal CAR T cells based on Fc{gamma} receptors exhibit a specific tumor-killing effect.

    "abstract": "T cell-based cancer immunotherapy has typically relied on membrane-bound cytotoxicity enhancers such as chimeric antigen receptors expressed in autologous {beta}T cells. These approaches are limited by tonic signalling of synthetic constructs and costs associated with manufacture of bespoke patient products. {gamma}{delta}T cells are an emerging alternative chassis for cellular therapy, possessing innate anti-tumour activity, potent antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) and minimal alloreactivity. We present an immunotherapeutic platform technology built around the V{gamma}9V{delta}2 {gamma}{delta}T cell chassis, harnessing specific characteristics of this cell type and offering an allo-compatible means of delivering cellular therapy that recruits bystander immunity. We engineered {gamma}{delta}T cells to secrete synthetic opsonins and stabilized IL15 (stIL15). Using GD2 as a model antigen we show how opsonin-secreting V{gamma}9V{delta}2 (OPS-{gamma}{delta}) have enhanced cytotoxicity and also confer this benefit on lymphoid and myeloid bystander cells. Reflecting the secreted nature of the engineered efficacy modules, the entire product rather than just the gene-modified fraction exhibited enhanced activation and cytotoxic profiles, superior persistence and proliferative capacity even upon repeated tumour challenge. Secretion of stIL15 abrogated the need for exogenous cytokine supplementation during expansion and further mediated functional licensing of bystander NK cells. Compared to unmodified {gamma}{delta}T cells, stIL15-OPS-{gamma}{delta} cells exhibited superior in-vivo control of subcutaneous tumour and persistence in the blood. stIL15-OPS-{gamma}{delta} cells were further efficacious in 3D patient-derived osteosarcoma models, where efficacy could be boosted with the addition of immunomodulatory aminobisphosphonate drug, zoledronic acid. Together the data identify stIL15-OPS-{gamma}{delta} cells as a novel allogeneic platform combining direct cytolysis with bystander activation to effect solid tumour control.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryArmoured, opsonin-secreting OPS-{gamma}{delta} cell immunotherapy is built on the innate strengths of the V{gamma}9V{delta}2 cell chassis for allogeneic solid tumour targeting.",
