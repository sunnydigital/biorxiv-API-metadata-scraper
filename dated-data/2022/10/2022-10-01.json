    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) that has traditionally been considered a T cell-mediated disease. However, accumulating evidence points to a crucial role for B cells in disease processes. IgH[MOG] mice possess a transgenic immunoglobulin heavy chain derived from a monoclonal antibody specific to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG), a key target for autoimmune responses. Here, using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS, we investigated the susceptibility of IgH[MOG] mice to CD4+ T cell-driven disease that was induced by active immunization with MOG[35-55] autoantigen. We found that immunized IgH[MOG] mice rapidly developed severe EAE. While the frequency and absolute number of CNS-infiltrating B cells was similar between WT and IgH[MOG] mice, a greater frequency of class-switched and inflammatory cytokine-positive B cells were seen in the IgH[MOG] CNS. We observed an increased presence of class-switched and inflammatory cytokine-positive B cells in the IgH[MOG] CNS, as well as a greater frequency of IL-17- and GM-CSF-producing CD4+ T cells. Production of the Th17 maintenance factor IL-23 was increased from IgH[MOG] CNS-infiltrating B cells, and in vivo blockade of IL-23p19 strongly attenuated disease severity in IgH[MOG] mice. Strikingly, we observed an increased frequency of PD-1+CXCR5- T peripheral helper (Tph)-like cells in the CNS of IgH[MOG] mice and we also found that the meninges of immunized IgH[MOG] mice were characterized by an accumulation of tertiary lymphoid organs. Both Tph accumulation in the CNS, as well as meningeal inflammation, were again sharply reduced upon IL-23p19 blockade in vivo. Intriguingly, the expression of IL23a transcript in the cerebrospinal fluid of MS-affected individuals was positively correlated with the frequency of B cells. Altogether, these data show that MOG-specific B cells contribute to severe CD4+ T cell-driven EAE by promoting CNS accumulation of Th17 and Tph cells, as well as tertiary lymphoid organs in the CNS meninges, in an IL-23 dependent manner.",

    "abstract": "Economic and decision-making theories suppose that people would disengage from a task with near zero success probability, because this implicates little normative utility values. However, humans are often motivated for an extremely challenging task, even without any extrinsic incentives. The current study aimed to address the nature of this challenge-based motivation and its neural correlates. We found that, when participants played a skill-based task without extrinsic incentives, their task enjoyment increased as the chance of success decreased, even if the task was almost impossible to achieve. However, such challenge-based motivation was not observed when participants were rewarded for the task or the reward was determined in a probabilistic manner. The activation in the ventral striatum/pallidum tracked the pattern of task enjoyment. These results suggest that people are intrinsically motivated to challenge a nearly impossible task, but only when the task requires certain skills and extrinsic rewards are unavailable.",

    "abstract": "Rapid evolutionary change during range expansions can lead to diverging range core and front populations, with the emergence of dispersal syndromes (coupled responses in dispersal and life-history traits). Besides intraspecific effects, range expansions may be impacted by interspecific interactions such as parasitism. Yet, despite the potentially large impact of parasites imposing additional selective pressures on the host, their role on range expansions remains largely unexplored. Using microcosm populations of the ciliate Paramecium caudatum and its bacterial parasite Holospora undulata, we studied experimental range expansions under parasite presence or absence. We found that the interaction of range expansion and parasite treatments affected the evolution of host dispersal syndromes. Namely, front populations showed different associations of population growth parameters and swimming behaviours than core populations, indicating divergent evolution. Parasitism reshaped trait associations, with hosts evolved in the presence of the parasite exhibiting overall increased resistance and reduced dispersal. Nonetheless, when comparing infected range core and front populations, we found a positive association, suggesting joint evolution of resistance and dispersal at the front. We conclude that host-parasite interactions during range expansions can change evolutionary trajectories; this in turn may feed back on the ecological dynamics of the range expansion and parasite epidemics.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimers disease (AD) through mechanisms that remain incompletely characterized. Similar to AD, TBI models present with cellular metabolic alterations and modulated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Specifically, AD and TBI tissues display increases in amyloid-{beta} as well as its precursor, APP C-terminal fragment of 99 a.a. (C99). Our recent data in cell models of AD indicate that C99, due to its affinity for cholesterol, induces the formation of transient lipid raft domains in the ER known as mitochondria-associated ER membranes (\"MAM\" domains). The formation of these domains recruits and activates specific lipid metabolic enzymes that regulate cellular cholesterol trafficking and sphingolipid turnover. Increased C99 levels in AD cell models promote MAM formation and significantly modulate cellular lipid homeostasis. Here, these phenotypes were recapitulated in the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of TBI in adult mice. Specifically, the injured cortex and hippocampus displayed significant increases in C99 and MAM activity, as measured by phospholipid synthesis, sphingomyelinase activity and cholesterol turnover. In addition, our cell type-specific lipidomics analyses revealed significant changes in microglial lipid composition that are consistent with the observed alterations in MAM-resident enzymes. Altogether, we propose that alterations in the regulation of MAM and relevant lipid metabolic pathways could contribute to the epidemiological connection between TBI and AD.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=128 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/381756v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12d0989org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cd1eb2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19a56caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b7f3e1_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Newborn olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) wire into highly organized olfactory bulb (OB) circuits throughout life, enabling lifelong plasticity and regeneration. Immature OSNs form functional synapses capable of evoking firing in OB projection neurons but what contribution, if any, they make to odor processing is unknown. Here, we show that immature OSNs provide odor input to the OB, where they form monosynaptic connections with excitatory neurons. Importantly, immature OSNs respond as selectively to odorants as mature OSNs and provide information about high odorant concentrations at which mature OSN responses are already maximal, suggesting that immature and mature OSNs provide distinct odor input streams. Furthermore, mice can successfully perform odor detection and discrimination tasks using sensory input from immature OSNs alone. Together, our findings suggest that immature OSNs play a previously unappreciated role in olfactory-guided behavior.",

    "abstract": "Current models suggest that MIRO GTPases anchor cytoskeletal motors to the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). However, our previous findings indicate that the unconventional myosin, MYO19, interacts with MIRO weakly but that a MIRO-independent MOM-localizing domain interacts more tightly with the MOM. To test the model that MIRO proteins serve as weaker, initial recruiters of cytoskeletal motors to mitochondria, we examined interactions between TRAK proteins (microtubule motor-mitochondria adapter proteins) and the MOM via quantitative fluorescence microscopy and steady-state kinetic approaches. Using GFP-TRAK truncations expressed in MIRO1-2 double knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we identified a MIRO-independent mitochondrial binding domain in the C-terminus of TRAK1 and TRAK2, sufficient for localization to the MOM--similar to what we observed for full length GFP-TRAK proteins. The MIRO-binding domains (MBD) of the TRAK proteins were only able to localize to mitochondria in the presence of ectopic expression of MIRO. Importantly, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) demonstrated that the steady-state kinetics of TRAKMBD/MIRO2 interaction were faster-exchanging than for either full-length TRAK or the TRAK C-terminal MOM-binding domain expressed alone. These data support the model that MIRO supports weak associations of cytoskeletal motors to the MOM, while MIRO-independent binding contributes significantly to tighter association of such motors to the MOM.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells line all blood vessels, where they coordinate blood vessel formation and the blood-tissue barrier via regulation of cell-cell junctions. The nucleus also regulates endothelial cell behaviors, but it is unclear how the nucleus contributes to endothelial cell activities at the cell periphery. Here we show that the nuclear-localized LINC complex protein SUN1 regulates vascular sprouting and barrier function via effects on endothelial cell-cell junction morphology and function. Loss of murine endothelial Sun1 impaired blood vessel formation and destabilized junctions, angiogenic sprouts formed but retracted in SUN1-depleted sprouts, and zebrafish vessels lacking Sun1b had aberrant junctions and defective cell-cell connections. At the cellular level, SUN1 stabilized endothelial cell-cell junctions, promoted barrier function, and regulated contractility. Mechanistically, SUN1 depletion altered cell behaviors via the cytoskeleton without changing transcriptional profiles. Reduced peripheral microtubule density, fewer junction contacts and increased catastrophes accompanied SUN1 loss, and microtubule depolymerization phenocopied effects on junctions. Depletion of GEF-H1, a microtubule-regulated Rho activator, or the LINC complex protein nesprin-1 rescued defective junctions of SUN1-depleted endothelial cells. Thus, endothelial SUN1 regulates peripheral cell-cell junctions from the nucleus via LINC complex-based microtubule interactions that affect peripheral microtubule dynamics and Rho-regulated contractility, and this long-range regulation is important for proper blood vessel sprouting and barrier function.\n\nSUMMARYThe nuclear membrane protein SUN1 promotes blood vessel formation and barrier function by stabilizing endothelial cell-cell junctions. Communication between SUN1 and endothelial cell junctions relies upon proper microtubule dynamics and Rho signaling far from the nucleus, revealing long-range cellular communication from the nucleus to the cell periphery that is important for vascular development and function.",

    "abstract": "Mind wandering is a mental process involving spontaneously generated thought irrelevant to the current task or goal. Irrelevant thought in itself, however, does not necessarily lead to mind wandering, as this could be prevented by cognitive control functions. The strength of the control varies over time, as does the rate of spontaneous thought generation. Their combined dynamics generates a complex transition pattern among mental states, e.g., from task-focusing via multi-tasking to mind wandering. We investigated neural substrates of these mental dynamics. Participants reported mind-wandering and task-focused states during a tone counting task, while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Amplitudes of EEG alpha-band activity and auditory evoked potentials were computed as measures of default-mode network (DMN) and cognitive control network (CCN) activity, respectively. Effects of the measures on task performance and self-reported number of thoughts were estimated, allowing for effect latencies of up to 20min. Alpha amplitude effects were found to change in direction as the mental state shifts between task focusing and mind wandering; before a reported task-focused state, the amplitude effect on task performance was negative, while it was positive before a reported mind wandering. The fist effect occurred 4-6min, and the second effect 6-10min before a report. The results suggest that DMN slowly but dynamically influences cognitive control, effectuating transitions between task focused and mind wandering behavior.",

    "abstract": "Nanopore sensors could revolutionize single-molecule proteomics by providing a means for identification of known proteins through fingerprinting or by de novo sequencing. However, the complex chemical and physical properties of proteins present multiple challenges to the conventional nanopore sensing method, predominantly, the single-file threading of a protein chain into a nanopore and its transport through it. Herein we describe a general approach for realizing unidirectional transport of full-length proteins through nanopores. We show that the combination of a chemically resistant biological nanopore platform and a high concentration guanidinium chloride buffer enables protein unfolding and unidirectional transport through a pore, propelled by an electroosmotic effect that largely owes to the guanidinium chloride presence. The uniform and slow (~10 {micro}s/amino acid) single-file transport, when combined with supervised machine learning of the electrical current signatures obtained, allows us to use to discern the protein threading orientation and identity. In conjunction with a method for tail-modification of native proteins and higher-resolution nanopores, our approach could offer a path towards direct single-molecule protein fingerprinting without the requirement of a motor enzyme.",

Unlike existing integration strategies that rely on modality-specific joint embedding or geometric graphs, scTriangulate makes no assumption about the distributions of raw underlying values. As a result, this approach can solve unprecedented integration challenges, including the ability to automate reference cell-atlas construction, resolve clonal architecture within molecularly defined cell-populations and subdivide clusters to discover novel splicing-defined disease subtypes. scTriangulate is a flexible strategy for unified integration of single-cell or multimodal clustering solutions, from nearly unlimited sources.",

    "abstract": "The Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN) is composed of functionally distinct sub-populations of GABAergic neurons which form a neural network responsible for synchronizing most physiological and behavioral circadian rhythms in mammals. To date, little is known regarding which aspects of SCN rhythmicity are generated by individual SCN neurons, and which aspects result from neuronal interaction within a network. Here, we utilize in vivo miniaturized microscopy to measure fluorescent GCaMP-reported calcium dynamics in AVP-expressing neurons in the intact SCN of awake, behaving mice. We report that SCN AVP neurons exhibit periodic, slow calcium waves which we demonstrate, using in vivo electrical recordings, likely reflect burst-firing. Further, we observe substantial heterogeneity of function in that AVP neurons exhibit unstable rhythms, and relatively weak rhythmicity at the population level. Network analysis reveals that correlated cellular behavior, or coherence, among neuron pairs also exhibited stochastic rhythms with about 33% of pairs rhythmic at any time. Unlike single-cell variables, coherence exhibited a strong rhythm at the population level with time of maximal coherence among AVP neuronal pairs at CT/ZT 6 and 9, coinciding with the timing of maximal neuronal activity for the SCN as a whole. These results demonstrate robust circadian variation in the coordination between stochastically rhythmic neurons and that interactions between AVP neurons in the SCN may be more influential than single-cell activity in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Furthermore, they demonstrate that cells in this circuit, like those in many other circuits imaged in vivo, exhibit profound heterogenicity of function over time and space.\n\nSignificance StatementThis work is the first to employ two novel in vivo recording techniques, miniaturized calcium microscopy and optogentically-targeted single unit activity recording, to examine the rhythmic behavior of AVP expressing neurons both at the individual neuronal and network level. These results suggest that while AVP neurons are important for organismal rhythmicity, individual cellular rhythms are unstable and diverse. However, we observed correlated activity among these neurons which appears more reliably rhythmic, suggesting that emergent network properties of the SCN may be more relevant for organismal rhythmicity than individual neuronal characteristics.",

Several models were proposed to explain its inhibitory function, but quantitative measurement is needed for model evaluation and refinement. We report a broadly applicable live-cell method for calibrated dose-response characterization of the nuclear transport alteration by a protein of interest. Using this method, we found that SARS-CoV-2 ORF6 is ~15 times more potent than SARS-CoV-1 ORF6 in inhibiting bidirectional nuclear transport, due to differences in the NUP98-binding C-terminal region that is required for the inhibition. The N-terminal region promotes membrane binding and was required for activity, but could be replaced by constructs which forced oligomerization in solution. Based on these data, we propose that the hydrophobic N-terminal region drives oligomerization of ORF6 to multivalently cross-link the FG domains of NUP98 at the nuclear pore complex, and this multivalent binding inhibits bidirectional transport.",

We found that both individuals with ASD and matched controls were able to adjust the weight of the ensemble prior for the reproduction according to the volatility of the sequence. However, the ASD group, as compared to the control group, relied generally less on the prior while also exhibiting marked carry-over of the weight of the prior when environmental volatility changes. Of note, though, four extremes among the 32 ASD individuals showed a reproduction pattern on the opposite end of the spectrum: heavy reliance on the prior in the volatile environment. Overall, our findings suggest that it is not the learning of the prior per se that is compromised in ASD. Rather, a less adaptive response to a change of the volatility regimen or to a volatile environment causes a highly inflexible weighting of prediction errors and the prior.",

    "abstract": "O_LIFunctional traits affect the demographic performance of individuals in their environment, leading to fitness differences that scale up to drive population dynamics and community assembly. Understanding the links between traits and fitness is therefore critical for predicting how populations and communities respond to environmental change. However, the net effects of traits on species fitness are largely unknown because we have lacked a framework for estimating fitness across multiple species and environments.\nC_LIO_LIWe present a modeling framework that integrates trait effects on demographic performance over the life cycles of individuals to estimate the net effect of traits on species fitness. This approach involves 1) modeling trait effects on individual demographic rates (growth, survival, and recruitment) as multidimensional performance surfaces that vary with individual size and environment and 2) integrating these effects into a population model to project population growth rates (i.e., fitness) as a function of traits and environment. We illustrate our approach by estimating performance surfaces and fitness landscapes for trees across a temperature gradient in the eastern United States.\nC_LIO_LIFunctional traits (wood density, specific leaf area, and maximum height) interacted with individual size and temperature to influence tree growth, survival, and recruitment rates, generating demographic trade-offs and shaping the contours of fitness landscapes. Tall tree species had high survival, growth, and fitness across the temperature gradient. Wood density and specific leaf area had interactive effects on demographic performance, resulting in fitness landscapes with multiple peaks.\nC_LIO_LIWith this approach it is now possible to empirically estimate the net effect of traits on fitness, leading to improved understanding of the selective forces that drive community assembly and permitting generalizable predictions of population and community dynamics in changing environments.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Interoception, or an awareness of the internal body state, guides agents in adaptive behavior by informing them of ongoing bodily signals, such as heart rate or energy status. However, it is still unclear whether the human brain represents the differences in the subjective experience of interoception differently. Hence, we directly compared the neural activation for cardiac (awareness related to heartbeats) and gastric (awareness related to the stomach) interoception in the same population (healthy human, N = 31). Participants were asked to focus on their heart and stomach sensations to be aware of interoception in a magnetic resonance imaging scanner. The results indicated that neural activation underlying gastric interoception encompassed larger brain regions, including the occipitotemporal visual cortices, bilateral primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex, left orbitofrontal cortex, and bilateral hippocampal regions. Cardiac interoception, however, selectively activated the right anterior insula extending to the frontal operculum more compared to gastric interoception. Moreover, our detailed analyses focusing on the insula, the most relevant region for interoception, revealed that the left dorsal middle insula encoded cardiac and gastric interoception in different activation patterns but not the posterior insula. Our results demonstrate that cardiac and gastric interoception have distinct neural substrates; in particular, the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.\n\nSignificance statementInteroception, subjective senses that arise from within the body, plays a critical role in maintaining adaptive behavior by informing of the ongoing bodily states, such as heart rate and energy status. Although interoception has various characteristics depending on its source signals, previous neuroimaging studies have extensively used cardiac interoception (senses related to heartbeats), making it unclear whether the brain differently encodes diverse experiences of interoception. Here, we demonstrate that cardiac interoception and gastric interoception (senses related to the stomach) have distinct neural substrates by combining mass-univariate analysis with multivoxel pattern analysis for fMRI data. Our findings suggest that the selective brain activation may reflect differences in the functional roles of cardiac and gastric interoception.",

    "abstract": "Seasonal influenza epidemics pose a considerable hazard for global health. In the past decades, accumulating evidence revealed that influenza A virus (IAV) renders the host vulnerable to bacterial superinfections which in turn are a major cause for morbidity and mortality. However, whether the impact of influenza on anti-bacterial innate immunity is restricted to the vicinity of the lung or systemically extends to remote sites is underexplored. We therefore sought to investigate intranasal infection of adult C57BL/6J mice with IAV H1N1 in combination with bacteremia elicited by intravenous application of Group A Streptococcus (GAS). Co-infection in vivo was supplemented in vitro by challenging murine bone marrow derived macrophages and exploring gene expression and cytokine secretion. Our results show that viral infection of mice caused mild disease and induced the depletion of CCL2 in the periphery. Influenza preceding GAS infection promoted the occurrence of paw edemas and was accompanied by exacerbated disease scores. In vitro co-infection of macrophages led to significantly elevated expression of TLR2 and CD80 compared to bacterial mono-infection, whereas CD163 and CD206 were downregulated. The GAS-inducible upregulation of inflammatory genes, such as Nos2, as well as the secretion of TNF and IL-1{beta} were notably reduced or even abrogated following co-infection. Our results indicate that IAV primes an innate immune layout that is inadequately equipped for bacterial clearance.",

To evaluate methylation associated regulation in AT/RTs, we compared them to medulloblastomas and choroid plexus tumors by integrating DNA methylation (507 samples), gene expression (120 samples), and public transcription factor (TF) binding data. We showed that elevated DNA methylation masks the binding sites of TFs driving neural development and is associated with reduced transcription for specific neural regulators in AT/RTs. Part of the hypermethylated sites behaved similarly in AT/RTs and pluripotent stem cells, revealing DNA methylation -driven halted cell differentiation. AT/RT-unique DNA hypermethylation was associated with polycomb repressive complex 2 members, like EZH2, and linked to suppressed genes with a role in neural development and tumorigenesis. The obtained results highlight and characterize these DNA methylation programs as drivers of AT/RT malignancy.",

    "abstract": "Selective breeding of domestic dogs has generated diverse breeds often optimized for performing specialized tasks. Despite the heritability of breed-typical behavioral traits, identification of causal loci has proven challenging due to the complexity of canine population structure. We overcome longstanding difficulties in identifying genetic drivers of canine behavior by developing an innovative framework for understanding relationships between breeds and the behaviors that define them, utilizing genetic data for over 4,000 domestic, semi-feral and wild canids and behavioral survey data for over 46,000 dogs. We identify ten major canine genetic lineages and their behavioral correlates, and show that breed diversification is predominantly driven by non-coding regulatory variation. We determine that lineage-associated genes converge in neurodevelopmental co-expression networks, identifying a sheepdog-associated enrichment for interrelated axon guidance functions. This work presents a scaffold for canine diversification that positions the domestic dog as an unparalleled system for revealing the genetic origins of behavioral diversity.",

Additionally, this axis is thought to guide signal propagation and integration across the cortical hierarchy. While human neuroimaging work has shown that this axis constrains local properties of the human connectome, it remains unclear whether it also shapes the asymmetric signaling that arises from higher-order connectome topology. Here, we used network control theory to examine the amount of energy required to propagate dynamics across the sensory-fugal axis. Our results revealed an asymmetry in this energy indicating that bottom-up transitions were easier to complete compared to top-down transitions. Supporting analyses demonstrated that this asymmetry was underpinned by a connectome topology that is wired to support efficient bottom-up signaling. Finally, we found that this asymmetry correlated with changes in intrinsic neuronal timescales and lessened throughout youth. Our results show that cortical variation in cytoarchitecture may guide the formation of macroscopic connectome topology.",

    "abstract": "The Reoviridae family of dsRNA viruses is characterized by its members capacity for endogenous transcription of their multipartite genomes within proteinaceous capsids of 1 to 3 layers. These viruses share inner core particles (ICPs) that conform to icosahedral, T=2*, symmetry, but differ in two major respects: first, the presence or absence of RNA-capping turrets at each icosahedral vertex; second, the number of additional host-specific capsid layers that are often lost upon cell entry. While the role of these additional layers in host infection is generally understood, the absence of asymmetric ICP structures from turreted, multilayered reoviruses has obfuscated our understanding of how successive removal of these external layers impact the structural organization of the ICP and transcription initiation. Here, we present the 3.3 [A] resolution structure of the aquareovirus (ARV) ICP, and atomic models of the capsid proteins VP3 and VP6, transcriptional enzymatic complex (TEC) subunits VP2 and VP4, and RNA-capping turret protein VP1. These structures reveal significant differences when compared to those of the coated ARV, as well as their counterparts in single-layered cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV). Compared to the double-layered ARV virion and infectious subvirion particle structures, the ARV ICP undergoes significant capsid expansion and widening of the nucleotide processing channels in its TEC and turret. Thus, the loss of outer capsid layers may regulate transcription initiation in ARV, unlike CPV which relies solely on allosteric regulation by binding transcriptional cofactors. These results shed new light on the mechanism of transcription initiation amongst turreted, multilayered members of Reoviridae.",

    "abstract": "Humans have profoundly impacted the distribution of plant and animal species over thousands of years. The most direct example of these effects is human-mediated movement of individuals, either through translocation of individuals within their range or the introduction of species to new habitats. While human involvement may be suspected in species with obvious range disjunctions, it can be difficult to detect natural versus human-mediated dispersal events for populations at the edge of a species range, and this uncertainty muddles how we understand the evolutionary history of populations and broad biogeographic patterns. Studies combining genetic data with archeological, linguistic, and historical evidence have confirmed prehistoric examples of human-mediated dispersal; however, it is unclear whether these methods can disentangle recent dispersal events, such as species translocated by European colonizers during the past 500 years. We use genomic DNA from historical specimens and historical records to evaluate three hypotheses regarding the timing and origin of Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in Cuba, whose status as an endemic or introduced population has long been debated. We discovered that bobwhites from southern Mexico arrived in Cuba between the 12th and 16th centuries, followed by the subsequent introduction of bobwhites from the southeastern USA to Cuba between the 18th and 20th centuries. These dates suggest the introduction of bobwhites to Cuba was human-mediated and concomitant with Spanish colonial shipping routes between Veracruz, Mexico and Havana, Cuba during this period. Our results identify endemic Cuban bobwhites as a genetically distinct population born of hybridization between divergent, introduced lineages.",

    "abstract": "Hydrothermal vents have a widespread geographical distribution and are of high interest for investigating microbial communities and robust enzymes for various industrial applications. We examined microbial communities and carboxylesterases of two terrestrial hydrothermal vents of the volcanic island of Ischia (Italy) predominantly composed of Firmicutes (Geobacillus and Brevibacillus spp.), Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota. High-temperature enrichment cultures with the polyester plastics polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and polylactic acid (PLA) resulted in an increase of Thermus and Geobacillus spp., and to some extent, Fontimonas and Schleiferia spp. The screening at 37-70{o}C of metagenomic fosmid library from above enrichment cultures resulted in identification and successful production in Escherichia coli of three hydrolases (IS10, IS11 and IS12), all derived from yet uncultured Chloroflexota and showing low sequence identity (33-56%) to characterized enzymes. Enzymes exhibited maximal esterase activity at temperatures 70-90{o}C, with IS11 showing the highest thermostability (90% activity after 20 min incubation at 80{o}C). IS10 and IS12 were highly substrate-promiscuous and hydrolysed all 51 monoester substrates tested. Enzymes were active with polyesters (PLA and polyethylene terephthalate model substrate, 3PET) and mycotoxin T-2 (IS12). IS10 and IS12 had a classical /{beta} hydrolase core domain with a serine hydrolase catalytic triad (Ser155, His280, and Asp250) in the hydrophobic active sites. The crystal structure of IS11 resolved at 2.92 [A] revealed the presence of the N-terminal {beta}-lactamase-like domain and C-terminal lipocalin domain. The catalytic cleft of IS11 includes catalytic residues Ser68, Lys71, Tyr160, and Asn162, whereas the lipocalin domain encloses the catalytic cleft like a lid contributing to substrate binding. Thus, this study has identified novel thermotolerant carboxylesterases with a broad substrate range including polyesters and mycotoxins for potential applications in biotechnology.\n\nIMPORTANCEHigh-temperature-active microbial enzymes are important biocatalysts for many industrial applications including recycling of synthetic and biobased polyesters increasingly used in textiles, fibres, coatings and adhesives. Here, we have discovered three novel thermotolerant carboxylesterases (IS10, IS11 and IS12) from high-temperature enrichment cultures from the Ischia hydrothermal vents incubated with biobased polymers. The identified metagenomic enzymes originated from uncultured Chloroflexota and showed low sequence similarity to known carboxylesterases. Active sites of IS10 and IS12 had the largest \"effective volumes\" among the characterized prokaryotic carboxylesterases and exhibited high substrate promiscuity, including hydrolysis of polyesters and mycotoxin T-2 (IS12). Though less promiscuous compared to IS10 and IS12, IS11 had a higher thermostability with high temperature optimum (80-90 {o}C) for activity, hydrolysed polyesters, and its crystal structure revealed an unusual lipocalin domain likely involved in substrate binding. The polyesterase activity in these enzymes makes them attractive candidates for further optimisation and potential application in plastics recycling.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) is a leading and severe threat to cognition that often goes undiagnosed. A major challenge in developing diagnostics and treatments for the consequences of rmTBI is the fundamental knowledge gaps that explain how rmTBI promotes brain dysfunction. It is both critical and urgent to understand the neuropathological and functional consequences of rmTBI to develop effective therapeutic strategies. In this study, we sought to define the extent of altered brain functional connectivity (FC) and expression of neuropathological markers after rmTBI. We performed two rmTBI (2x 0.6{square}J impacts 24{square}h apart) in male and female C57BL/6J wild-type (WT) (~2.5-3mo) mice using closed head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) or sham procedures. At 5-6 days post-injury (dpi), we measured changes in brain volume and FC using T2-weighted images, resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), and graph theory analyses. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess microstructural changes in white matter tracts. In addition, at 7dpi, we measured changes in Iba1 and GFAP to determine the extent of gliosis. The expression of disease-associated protein markers in grey and white matter regions were evaluated using the NanoString-GeoMx digital spatial protein profiling (DSP) platform. The rsfMRI data revealed aberrant changes in connectivity such as node clustering coefficient, global and local efficiency, participation coefficient, eigenvector centrality, and betweenness centrality in thalamus and other key brain regions that process visual, auditory, and somatosensory information. In addition, DTI revealed significantly decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity in the optic tract. Also, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity (L1) were significantly increased in the hippocampus. DSP revealed that phospho-serine 199 tau (pS199) as well as glial markers such as GFAP, cathepsin-D, and Iba1 were significantly increased in the optic tract. In thalamic nuclei, the neuroinflammatory marker GPNMB was increased significantly, and the cell proliferation marker Ki-67 was decreased in the rmTBI group. Our data suggest that rmTBI significantly alters brain functional connectivity and causes a profound inflammatory response in gray matter regions, beyond chronic white matter damage.",

To investigate concurrent changes in the transcriptome, we exposed exponentially growing HL-60/S4 cells to acute hyperosmotic stress ([~]600 milliOsmolar) for 30 and 60 minutes by addition of sucrose to the culture medium. We employed RNA-Seq of polyA mRNA to identify genes with significantly increased or decreased transcript levels relative to untreated control cells (i.e., differential gene expression).

In hyperosmotically-stressed cells, multiple GO terms associated with transcription, translation, mitochondrial function and proteosome activity, as well as the gene set \"replication-dependent histones\", were over-represented among genes with increased transcript levels; whereas, genes with decreased transcript levels were over-represented in various GO terms for transcription repressors. The overall transcriptome profiles of these stressed cells suggest a rapid acquisition of cellular rebuilding, a futile homeostatic response, as these cells are ultimately doomed to a dehydrated death.\n\n\"Do not go gentle into that good night\n\nRage, rage against the dying of the light\"\n\nDylan Thomas (1914-1953)",

Yet, targeted metabolomic analysis using [U-13C]malate also revealed concomitant succinate dehydrogenase reversal during anoxia yielding succinate by reducing fumarate, albeit to a small extent.

    "abstract": "Investigation of nuclear lamina architecture relies on super-resolved microscopy. However, epitope accessibility, labeling density, and detection precision of individual molecules pose challenges within the molecularly crowded nucleus. We developed iterative indirect immunofluorescence (IT-IF) staining approach combined with expansion microscopy (ExM) and structured illumination microscopy to improve super-resolution microscopy of subnuclear nanostructures like lamins. We prove that ExM is applicable in analyzing highly compacted nuclear multiprotein complexes such as viral capsids and provide technical improvements to ExM method including 3D-printed gel casting equipment. We show that in comparison to conventional immunostaining, IT-IF results in a higher signal-to-background -ratio and a mean fluorescence intensity by improving the labeling density. Moreover, we present a signal processing pipeline for noise estimation, denoising, and deblurring to aid in quantitative image analyses and provide this platform for the microscopy imaging community. Finally, we show the potential of signal-resolved IT-IF in quantitative super-resolution ExM imaging of nuclear lamina and reveal nanoscopic details of the lamin network organization - a prerequisite for studying intranuclear structural co-regulation of cell function and fate.

    "abstract": "To survive, insects must effectively navigate odors plumes to their source. In natural plumes, turbulent winds break up smooth odor regions into disconnected patches, so navigators encounter brief bursts of odor interrupted by bouts of clean air. The timing of these encounters plays a critical role in navigation, determining the direction, rate, and magnitude of insects orientation and speed dynamics. Still, disambiguating the specific role of odor timing from other cues, such as spatial structure, is challenging due to natural correlations between plumes temporal and spatial features. Here, we use optogenetics to isolate temporal features of odor signals, examining how the frequency and duration of odor encounters shape the navigational decisions of freely-walking Drosophila. We find that fly angular velocity depends on signal frequency and intermittency - fraction of time signal can be detected - but not directly on durations. Rather than switching strategies when signal statistics change, flies smoothly transition between signal regimes, by combining an odor offset response with a frequency-dependent novelty-like response. In the latter, flies are more likely to turn in response to each odor hit only when the hits are sparse. Finally, the upwind bias of individual turns relies on a filtering scheme with two distinct timescales, allowing rapid and sustained responses in a variety of signal statistics. A quantitative model incorporating these ingredients recapitulates fly orientation dynamics across a wide range of environments.",

    "abstract": "The number of unannotated or orphan enzymes vastly outnumber those for which the chemical structure of the substrates are known. While a number of enzyme function prediction algorithms exist, these often predict Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers or enzyme family, which limits their ability to generate experimentally testable hypotheses. Here, we harness protein language models, cheminformatics, and machine learning classification techniques to accelerate the annotation of orphan enzymes by predicting their substrates chemical structural class. We use the orphan enzymes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a case study, focusing on two protein families that are highly abundant in its proteome: the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductases (SDRs) and the S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent methyltransferases. Training machine learning classification models that take as input the protein sequence embeddings obtained from a pre-trained, self-supervised protein language model results in excellent accuracy for a wide variety of prediction tasks. These include redox cofactor preference for SDRs; small-molecule vs. polymer (i.e. protein, DNA or RNA) substrate preference for SAM-dependent methyltransferases; as well as more detailed chemical structural predictions for the preferred substrates of both enzyme families. We then use these trained classifiers to generate predictions for the full set of unannotated SDRs and SAM-methyltransferases in the proteomes of M. tuberculosis and other mycobacteria, generating a set of biochemically testable hypotheses. Our approach can be extended and generalized to other enzyme families and organisms, and we envision it will help accelerate the annotation of a large number of orphan enzymes.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=106 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/509940v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dab89forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8eec65org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@141ff13org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d16212_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Malaria parasites avoid immune clearance through their ability to systematically alter antigens exposed on the surface of infected red blood cells. This is accomplished by tightly regulated transcriptional control of individual members of a large, multicopy gene family called var and is the key to both the virulence and chronic nature of malaria infections. Expression of var genes is mutually exclusive and controlled epigenetically, however how large populations of parasites coordinate var gene switching to avoid premature exposure of the antigenic repertoire is unknown. Here we provide evidence for a transcriptional network anchored by a universally conserved gene called var2csa that coordinates the switching process. We describe a structured switching bias that shifts overtime and could shape the pattern of var expression over the course of a lengthy infection. Our results provide an explanation for a previously mysterious aspect of malaria infections and shed light on how parasites possessing a relatively small repertoire of variant antigen encoding genes can coordinate switching events to limit antigen exposure, thereby maintaining chronic infections.",

    "abstract": "The currently expanding monkeypox epidemic is caused by a subclade IIb descendant of a monkeypox virus (MPXV) lineage traced back to Nigeria in 1971. In contrast to monkeypox cases caused by clade I and subclade IIa MPXV, the prognosis of current cases is generally favorable, but person-to-person transmission is much more efficient. MPXV evolution is driven by selective pressure from hosts and loss of virus-host interacting genes. However, there is no satisfactory genetic explanation using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for the observed increased MPXV transmissibility. We hypothesized that key genomic changes may occur in the genomes low-complexity regions (LCRs), which are highly challenging to sequence and have been dismissed as uninformative. Using a combination of highly sensitive techniques, we determined a first high-quality MPXV genome sequence of a representative of the current epidemic with LCRs resolved at unprecedented accuracy. This effort revealed significant variation in short-tandem repeats within LCRs. We demonstrate that LCR entropy in the MPXV genome is significantly higher than that of SNPs and that LCRs are not randomly distributed. In silico analyses indicate that expression, translation, stability, or function of MPXV orthologous poxvirus genes (OPGs) 153, 204, and 208 could be affected in a manner consistent with the established \"genomic accordion\" evolutionary strategies of orthopoxviruses. Consequently, we posit that genomic studies focusing on phenotypic MPXV clade-/subclade-/lineage-/strain differences should change their focus to the study of LCR variability instead of SNP variability.",

    "abstract": "The SOS response is a bacterial DNA damage response pathway that has been heavily implicated in bacterias ability to evolve resistance to antibiotics. Activation of the SOS response is dependent on the interaction between two bacterial proteins, RecA and LexA. RecA acts as a DNA damage sensor by forming lengthy oligomeric filaments (RecA*) along single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in an ATP-dependent manner. RecA* can then bind to LexA, the repressor of SOS response genes, triggering LexA degradation and leading to induction of the SOS response. Formation of the RecA*-LexA complex therefore serves as the key  SOS activation signal. Given the challenges associated with studying a complex involving multiple macromolecular interactions, the essential constituents of RecA* that permit LexA cleavage are not well defined. Here, we leverage head-to-tail linked and end-capped RecA constructs as tools to define the minimal RecA* filament that can engage LexA. In contrast to previously postulated models, we found that as few as three linked RecA units are capable of ssDNA binding, LexA binding, and LexA cleavage. We further demonstrate that RecA oligomerization alone is insufficient for LexA cleavage, with an obligate requirement for ATP and ssDNA binding to form a competent SOS activation signal with the linked constructs. Our minimal system for RecA* highlights the limitations of prior models for the SOS activation signal and offers a novel tool that can inform efforts to slow acquired antibiotic resistance by targeting the SOS response.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=108 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510415v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (20K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@149d719org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c8dd3corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1349098org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fb29_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The transcription of its many Zn transporters is therefore tightly regulated by a known set of transcription factors involved in either the import or the export of Zn. In this work, we show that the Zur protein, a well-known repressor of Zn import, plays a dual role and functions in both import and export processes. In a situation of Zn excess, Zur represses Zn entry, but also activates the transcription of czcR, a positive regulator of the Zn export system. To achieve this, Zur binds at two sites, located by DNA footprinting in the region downstream the czcR transcription start site. In agreement with this regulation, a delay in induction of the efflux system is observed in the absence of Zur and Zn resistance is affected. The discovery of this regulation highlights a new role of Zur as global regulator of Zn homeostasis in P. aeruginosa disclosing an important link between Zur and zinc export.",

    "abstract": "Ribosomes, the molecular machines that are central to protein synthesis, have gradually been gaining prominence for their regulatory role in translation. Eukaryotic cytosolic ribosomes are typically larger than bacterial ones, partly due to multi-nucleotide insertions at specific conserved positions in the ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs). Such insertions called expansion segments (ESs) are present primarily on the ribosomal surface, with their role in translation and its regulation remaining under-explored. One such ES in the ribosomal large subunit (LSU) is ES30L, which is present only in mammals and birds among eukaryotes. In this study, we show that ES30L possesses complementarity to many protein-coding transcripts in humans and that the complementarity is enriched around the start codon, hinting at a possible role in translation regulation. Further, our in silico analysis analyses and pull-down assays indicate that ES30L may bind to secondary structures in the 5 UTR of several transcripts and RNA binding proteins (RBPs) that are essential for translation. Thus, we have identified a potential regulatory role for ES30L in translation.",

Specific lysine residues promoted Cdc42p degradation at 37{degrees}C [K166; and residues in the Poly-Basic (PB) domain: K183, K184, K186, K187], which occurred in both the 26S proteosome and ESCRT-to-vacuole pathway. Degradation of Cdc42p at 37{degrees}C reduced the sensitivity to mating pheromone, demonstrating biological role for Cdc42p turnover in this context. Stabilization of Cdc42p at high temperatures restored pheromone sensitivity but caused growth and polarity defects, suggesting a tradeoff between sexual propagation and cellular fitness. One lysine residue (K16) in the P-loop of the protein was critical for stability. Overproduction of the protein, expression of Cdc42pK16R in a mutant where the protein accumulates, and other types of proteostatic stress led to the formation of Cdc42p aggregates in aging mother cells. These new aspects of Cdc42p protein quality control may extend to other members of the Rho GTPase family of proteins.\n\nSummary statementRho GTPases regulate cell polarity and signaling (e.g. MAPK) pathways. Here, we discovered that yeast Cdc42p is targeted for degradation at 37{degrees}C by a NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase and HSP40 and HSP70 chaperones through lysine residues in the C-terminus of the protein. At 37{degrees}C, Cdc42p was degraded both by the 26S proteasome and in an ESCRT-dependent manner in the vacuole. Preventing Cdc42p turnover at 37{degrees}C resulted in improved mating sensitivity but also viability and polarity defects, suggesting a tradeoff between sexual responses and fitness. In addition, one residue (K16) was critical for Cdc42p stability. Cdc42pK16R formed aggregates in aging mother cells, and aggregates were also observed in cells undergoing proteostatic stress. Protein quality control regulation of a Rho-type GTPase therefore has ramification in the regulation of cellular responses, evolutionary tradeoffs, and protein aggregation in ways that might impact aging.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIHigh temperatures (37{degrees}C) induce turnover of the Rho GTPase Cdc42p\nC_LIO_LITurnover of Cdc42p at 37{degrees}C requires the HSP40/HSP70 proteins and the NEDD4-type E3 ubiquitin ligase Rsp5p.\nC_LIO_LIK166 and four lysines at the extreme C-terminus [poly-basic (PB: K183, K184, K186, K187] promote turnover of Cdc42p at 37{degrees}C\nC_LIO_LICdc42p is degraded at 37{degrees}C by the proteosome and the ESCRT-to-vacuole pathways.\nC_LIO_LIGTP-Cdc42p does not accumulate in ESCRT mutants and is not turned over in the vacuole.\nC_LIO_LITurnover of Cdc42p at 37{degrees}C inhibits sensitivity to mating pheromone Preventing Cdc42p turnover restores pheromone sensitivity at the cost of cell viability and proper cell polarity.

    "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests that cell division and basement membrane invasion are mutually exclusive cellular behaviors. How cells switch between proliferative and invasive states is not well understood. Here, we investigated this dichotomy in vivo by examining two cell types in the developing Caenorhabditis elegans somatic gonad that derive from equipotent progenitors, but exhibit distinct cell behaviors: the post-mitotic, invasive anchor cell and the neighboring proliferative, non-invasive ventral uterine (VU) cells. We show that the fates of these cells post-specification are more plastic than previously appreciated and that levels of NHR-67 are important for discriminating between invasive and proliferative behavior. Transcription of nhr-67 is downregulated following post-translational degradation of its direct upstream regulator, HLH-2 (E/Daughterless) in VU cells. In the nuclei of VU cells, residual NHR-67 protein is compartmentalized into discrete punctae that are dynamic over the cell cycle and exhibit liquid-like properties. By screening for proteins that colocalize with NHR-67 punctae, we identified new regulators of uterine cell fate maintenance: homologs of the transcriptional co-repressor Groucho (UNC-37 and LSY-22), as well as the TCF/LEF homolog POP-1. We propose a model in which association of NHR-67 with the Groucho/TCF complex suppresses the default invasive state in non-invasive cells, which complements transcriptional regulation to add robustness to the proliferative-invasive cellular switch in vivo.",

Single-cell transcriptomics revealed that dmd-9 is highly expressed in specific head sensory neurons, with lower levels detected in non-neuronal tissues (uterine cells and spermatheca). Here, we characterized endogenous dmd-9 expression and function in hermaphrodites and males to identify potential sexually dimorphic roles. In addition, we dissected the trans- and cis-regulatory mechanisms that control DMD-9 expression in neurons. Our results show that of the 22 DMD-9-expressing neuronal reporters we analyzed, only the neuropeptide-encoding flp-19 gene is cell-autonomously regulated by DMD-9. Further, we did not identify defects in behaviors mediated by DMD-9 expressing neurons in dmd-9 mutants. We found that dmd-9 expression in neurons is regulated by four neuronal fate regulatory TFs: ETS-5, EGL-13, CHE-1, and TTX-1. In conclusion, our study characterized the DMD-9 expression pattern and regulatory logic for its control. We found that, as with other DMD TFs, DMD-9 likely acts redundantly to control neuronal development and function.",

The conserved Sec61 protein translocon facilitates polypeptide translocation and coordinates cotranslational polypeptide processing events. In cells, the majority of Sec61 is stably associated with a heterotetrameric membrane protein complex, the translocon associated protein complex (TRAP), yet the mechanism by which TRAP assists in polypeptide translocation or cotranslational modifications such as N-glycosylation remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate the structure of the core Sec61/TRAP complex bound to a mammalian ribosome by Cryo-EM. The interactions with ribosome anchor the Sec61/TRAP complex in a conformation that renders the ER membrane locally thinner by significantly curving its the lumenal leaflet. We propose a model for how TRAP stabilizes the ribosome exit tunnel to assist nascent polypeptide insertion through Sec61 and provides a ratcheting mechanism into the ER lumen by direct polypeptide interactions.",

    "abstract": "Replication protein A (RPA) is a eukaryotic single stranded (ss) DNA binding (SSB) protein that is essential for all aspects of genome maintenance. RPA binds ssDNA with high affinity but can also diffuse along ssDNA. By itself, RPA is capable of transiently disrupting short regions of duplex DNA by diffusing from a ssDNA that flanks the duplex DNA. Using single molecule total internal reflection fluorescence and optical trapping combined with fluorescence approaches we show that S. cerevisiae Pif1 can use its ATP-dependent 5 to 3 translocase activity to chemo-mechanically push a single human RPA (hRPA) directionally along ssDNA at rates comparable to those of Pif1 translocation alone. We further show that using its translocation activity Pif1 can push hRPA from a ssDNA loading site into a duplex DNA causing stable disruption of at least 9 bp of duplex DNA. These results highlight the dynamic nature of hRPA enabling it to be readily reorganized even when bound tightly to ssDNA and demonstrate a new mechanism by which directional DNA unwinding can be achieved through the combined action of a ssDNA translocase that pushes an SSB protein.",

However, precise survival mechanisms controlled by {beta}III-tubulin in cancer cells are unknown. Here, we report an unexpected role of {beta}III-tubulin as a brake on extrinsic caspase 8-dependent apoptosis in PDAC. We show that {beta}III-tubulin knockdown frees death-receptor DR5 to increase its membrane diffusion, clustering, and activation of cell-death. We demonstrate that {beta}III-ubulin silencing increases sensitivity of PDAC cells to chemotherapeutic and microenvironment-derived extrinsic cell-death signals including TRAIL, TNF, and FasL. Finally, nanoparticle delivery of {beta}III-tubulin siRNA to mouse orthotopic PDAC tumours in vivo and human patient-derived PDAC tumour explants ex vivo increases extrinsic apoptosis and reduces tumour progression. Thus, silencing of {beta}III-tubulin represents an innovative strategy to unleash a suicide signal in PDAC cells and render them sensitive to microenvironment and chemotherapy-derived death signals.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionBacterial pulmonary infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in neonates, with less severity in older children. Previous studies demonstrated that the DNA of CD4+ T cells in the mouse lung, whose primary responsibility is to coordinate the immune response foreign pathogens, is differentially methylated in neonates compared with juveniles. Nevertheless, the effect of this differential DNA methylation on CD4+ T cell gene expression and response to infection remains unclear.\n\nMethodsWe treated E. coli-infected neonatal (4-day-old) and juvenile (13-day-old) mice with decitabine (DAC), a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor with broad-spectrum DNA demethylating activity, and performed simultaneous genome-wide DNA methylation and transcriptional profiling on lung CD4+ T cells.\n\nResultsJuvenile and neonatal mice experienced differential demethylation in response to DAC treatment, with larger methylation differences observed in neonates. By cross-filtering differentially expressed genes between juveniles and neonates with those sites that were demethylated in neonates, we found that interferon-responsive genes such as Ifit1 are the most down-regulated methylation-sensitive genes in neonatal mice. DAC treatment shifted neonatal lung CD4+ T cells toward a gene expression program similar to that of juveniles.\n\nConclusionFollowing lung infection with E. coli, lung CD4+ T cells in neonatal mice exhibit epigenetic repression of important host defense pathways, which are activated by inhibition of DNA methyltransferase activity to resemble a more mature profile.",

Here, we investigated lineage-specific virus-host dynamics in grassland soil following \"wet-up\", when resident microbes are both resuscitated and lysed after a prolonged dry period. Quantitative isotope tracing, time-resolved metagenomics and viromic analyses indicated that dry soil held a diverse but low biomass reservoir of virions, of which only a subset thrived following wet-up. Viral richness decreased by 50% within 24 h post wet-up, while viral biomass increased four-fold within one week. Counter to recent hypotheses suggesting temperate viruses predominate in soil, our evidence indicates that wet-up is dominated by viruses in lytic cycles. We estimate that viruses drive a measurable and continuous rate of cell lysis, with up to 46% of microbial death driven by viral lysis one week following wet-up. Thus, viruses contribute to turnover of soil microbial biomass and the widely reported CO2 efflux following wet-up of seasonally dry soils.",

Solving the structure of the C-terminal tryptophan rich domain that defines the TRAg family revealed a three-helical bundle that is conserved across Plasmodium and has homology with lipid-binding BAR domains involved in membrane remodelling. Biochemical assays confirmed that this domain has lipid binding activity with preference for sulfatide, a glycosphingolipid present in the outer leaflet of plasma membranes. Deletion of the putative orthologue in P. knowlesi, PKNH_1300500, impacts invasion in reticulocytes, suggesting a role for membrane remodelling during this essential process.

    "abstract": "Insertions and deletions (indels) are common sources of structural variation, and insertions originating from spontaneous DNA lesions are frequent in cancer. We developed a highly sensitive assay in human cells (Indel-Seq) to monitor rearrangements at the TRIM37 acceptor locus which reports indels stemming from experimentally-induced and spontaneous genome instability. Templated insertions derive from sequences genome-wide and are enriched within 100 kb of donor regions flanking a DSB. Insertions require contact between donor and acceptor loci as well as DNA-PK catalytic activity. Notably, these templated insertions originate from actively transcribed loci, underscoring transcription as a critical source of spontaneous genome instability. Transcription-coupled insertions involve a DNA/RNA hybrid intermediate and are stimulated by DNA end-processing. Using engineered Cas9 breaks, we establish that ssDNA overhangs at the acceptor site greatly stimulate insertions. Indel-Seq revels that insertions are generated via at least three distinct pathways. Our studies indicate that insertions result from movement and subsequent contact between acceptor and donor loci followed invasion or annealing, then by non-homologous end-joining at the acceptor site.",

Telomere Position Effect - Over Long Distances (TPE-OLD) modulates genes expression by changes in telomere-dependent long-distance loops, with a reach of 10Mb from a telomere. However, TPE-OLD remains poorly defined. To gain further insights into the genome-wide impact of telomere length on genomic and epigenomic regulation through TPE-OLD, we used cells with controlled telomere length combined to a genome wide transcriptome and methylome analysis. By integrating omics data, we identified a common cis-acting motif that behaves as an insulator or enhancer. Using reporter assays integrating this element, we uncovered the trans partners regulating this activity. Further exploiting our cellular model, we observed the depletion of one candidate factor, RBPJ, at TPE-OLD associated loci upon telomere shortening. We concluded that, at the genome-wide level, TPE-OLD is relayed by RBPJ binding Alu-like elements to telomeres that acts as enhancers. In response to external stimuli (i.e., Aging), TPE-OLD might act by coordinating telomere length to the action of Alu newly evolved enhancers in association with RBPJ.",

    "abstract": "The centriole duplication cycle must be tightly controlled and coordinated with the chromosome cycle. Aberrations in centriole biogenesis can lead to cancer, developmental disorders and ciliopathies. Here, we show that McIdas -previously implicated in cell cycle control and centriole amplification in multiciliated cells-is critical to maintain centriole numbers. Using expansion microscopy, we demonstrate that McIdas is present at the middle part of centrioles, where it exhibits a differential localization during the cell cycle. McIdas loss perturbs daughter centriole biogenesis and centrosomal SAS6 recruitment, whereas its overexpression induces centriole overduplication. Consistently, McIdas depletion reduces PLK4-induced centriole amplification. McIdas interacts with and is phosphorylated by PLK4 in multiple sites identified by mass spectrometry. Mutational analysis shows that McIdas phosphorylation is important for centriole number control. Overall, our results identify a novel, direct role of McIdas on centriole duplication that can link its previously characterized roles in the chromosome cycle and multiciliogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Recruitment of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) to promoter regions is essential for transcription. Despite conflicting evidence, the Pol II Pre-Initiation Complex (PIC) is often thought to be of uniform composition and assemble at all promoters via an identical mechanism. Here, we show using Drosophila melanogaster S2 cells as a model that promoter classes with distinct functions and initiation patterns function via PICs that display different compositions and dependencies: developmental promoter DNA readily associates with the canonical Pol II PIC, whereas housekeeping promoter DNA does not and instead recruit different factors such as DREF. Consistently, TBP and DREF are required by distinct sets of promoters, and TBP and its paralog TRF2 function at different promoter types, partly exclusively and partly redundantly. In contrast, TFIIA is required for transcription from all promoters, and we identify factors that can recruit and/or stabilize TFIIA at housekeeping promoters and activate transcription. We show that promoter activation by these factors is sufficient to induce the dispersed transcription initiation patterns characteristic of housekeeping promoters. Thus, different promoter classes direct distinct mechanisms of transcription initiation, which relate to different focused versus dispersed initiation patterns.",

    "abstract": "The fungal cell wall provides protection and structure, and is an important target for antifungal compounds. A MAP kinase cascade termed the cell wall integrity (CWI) pathway regulates transcriptional responses to cell wall damage. Here we describe a posttranscriptional pathway that plays an important complementary role. We discovered that the RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) Mrn1 and Nab6 specifically target the 3 UTRs of a largely overlapping set of cell wall-related mRNAs. These mRNAs are downregulated in the absence of Nab6, indicating a function in target mRNA stabilization. Nab6 acts in parallel to CWI signaling to maintain appropriate expression of cell wall genes during stress. Cells lacking both pathways are hypersensitive to antifungal compounds targeting the cell wall. Deletion of MRN1 partially alleviates growth defects associated with{Delta} nab6 and Mrn1 has an opposing function in mRNA destabilization. Our results uncover a novel posttranscriptional pathway which mediates cellular resistance to antifungal compounds.",

    "abstract": "Intestinal development, response to injury and disease states rely upon balanced stem cell proliferation. Historically, two subtypes of intestinal epithelial stem cells (ISCs)--slow-cycling/label-retaining, and actively-cycling/canonical Wnt-dependent--coordinate to drive proliferation and regulate epithelial renewal during adult tissue homeostasis and injury response. Recent studies focused on Bmi1-expressing cells revealed that differentiated Bmi1+ enteroendocrine cells could dedifferentiate towards a canonical Wnt-dependent stem cell state, calling into question the dogma that a dual stem cell axis regulates epithelial proliferation. Herein, we identify stem cell function in a Bmi1+ cell population in early murine intestinal development prior to the establishment of canonical Wnt-dependent, Lgr5-expressing ISCs. In-depth analyses of developmental Bmi1+ ISCs using lineage-tracing and single cell RNA-sequencing reveal their distinct identity and capacity to differentiate into Lgr5+ ISCs and other differentiated lineages. Further, during in utero development, the Bmi1+ ISCs initially exists in a highly proliferative state then transitions to a slow-cycling state, with the emergence of actively-cycling Lgr5+ ISCs. In adult tissue, Bmi1+ ISCs are a distinct population that re-express developmental gene and protein profiles, and a non-canonical Wnt signaling signature in response to injury and in human colorectal tumors. Further, developmental Bmi1+ ISCs are distinct from Lgr5+ ISCs and the previously identified differentiated Bmi1+ progenitor cells. Re-evaluation of an under-appreciated Bmi1+ ISC population with fundamental importance in intestinal development re-establishes the importance of the dynamic interplay between discrete ISC populations that are regulated by opposing Wnt signaling pathways. This finding opens opportunities and targetable pathways to augment regeneration or inhibit tumorigenesis.",

We sought to determine the requirements for RPA during eukaryotic DNA replication initiation and elongation. To determine whether the ssDNA-binding activity is sufficient, we tested SSBs from different domains of life in reconstituted S. cerevisiae origin unwinding and DNA replication reactions. Interestingly, E. coli SSB, but not T4 bacteriophage Gp32, fully substitutes for RPA in promoting origin DNA unwinding. Using RPA mutants, we found that only large, multimeric complexes with multiple DNA-binding domains support origin unwinding. In contrast, our studies demonstrated that eukaryotic replication fork function requires specific RPA domains for normal leading- and lagging-strand DNA synthesis.

    "abstract": "Theories of attention argue that objects are the units of attentional selection. In real-word environments such objects can contain visual and auditory features. To understand how mechanisms of selective attention operate in multisensory environments, we created an audiovisual cocktail-party situation, in which two speakers (left and right of fixation) simultaneously articulated brief numerals. In three separate blocks, informative auditory speech was presented (a) alone or paired with (b) congruent or (c) uninformative visual speech. In all blocks, subjects localized a pre-defined numeral. While audiovisual-congruent and uninformative speech improved response times and speed of information uptake according to diffusion modeling, an ERP analysis revealed that this did not coincide with enhanced attentional engagement. Yet, consistent with object-based attentional selection, the deployment of auditory spatial attention (N2ac) was accompanied by visuo-spatial attentional orienting (N2pc) irrespective of the informational content of visual speech. Notably, an N2pc component was absent in the auditory-only condition, demonstrating that a sound-induced shift of visuo-spatial attention relies on the availability of audio-visual features evolving coherently in time. Additional analyses revealed cross-modal interactions in working memory and modulations of cognitive control.

    "abstract": "Estrone and estradiol differentially modulate neuroplasticity and cognition but how they influence maturation pathways of new neurons is not known. The present study assessed the effects of estrone and estradiol on various aspects of neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG) of ovariectomized young adult Sprague-Dawley rats using daily subcutaneous injections of 17{beta}-estradiol or estrone. Rats were injected with a DNA synthesis marker, 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU), and were perfused one, two, or three weeks after BrdU injection and treatment. Immunofluorescent labelling for Sox2 and Ki67 were used to examine the density of neural stem cells and proliferating cells, respectively. Double-immunofluorescent labelling of BrdU with doublecortin (DCX) or NeuN was used to examine the attrition and maturation of adult-born neurons over time. Estradiol reduced the density of neural stem cells in the dorsal DG, whereas estrone reduced the density of neural stem cells in the ventral DG. Furthermore, estradiol enhanced, whereas estrone reduced, cell proliferation after one week but not after longer exposure to hormones. Both estrogens increased the density of BrdU/DCX-ir cells after one week of exposure but showed greater attrition of new neurons between one and two weeks after exposure. Lastly, estradiol decreased the percentage of BrdU/NeuN-ir cells in the dorsal DG after three weeks of treatment. These results demonstrate that estrogens have differential effects to modulate several aspects of adult hippocampal neurogenesis in the short term, but fewer effects after long-term exposure and that estradiol and estrone modulate neurogenesis via different pathways.",

    "abstract": "Metagenomic sequencing is a swift and powerful tool to ascertain the presence of an organism of interest in a sample. However, sequencing coverage of the organism of interest can be insufficient due to an inundation of reads from irrelevant organisms in the sample. Here, we report a nuclease-based approach to rapidly enrich for DNA from certain organisms, including enterobacteria, based on their differential endogenous modification patterns. We exploit the ability of taxon-specific methylated motifs to resist the action of cognate methylation-sensitive restriction endonucleases that thereby digest unwanted, unmethylated DNA. Subsequently, we use a distributive exonuclease or electrophoretic separation to deplete or exclude the digested fragments, thus, enriching for undigested DNA from the organism of interest. As a proof-of-concept, we apply this method to enrich for the enterobacteria Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica by 11- to 142-fold from mock metagenomic samples and validate this approach as a versatile means to enrich for genomes of interest in metagenomic samples.\n\nImportancePathogens that contaminate the food supply or spread through other means can cause outbreaks that bring devastating repercussions to the health of a populace. Investigations to trace the source of these outbreaks are initiated rapidly but can be drawn out due to the labored methods of pathogen isolation. Metagenomic sequencing can alleviate this hurdle but is often insufficiently sensitive. The approach and implementations detailed here provide a rapid means to enrich for many pathogens involved in foodborne outbreaks, thereby improving the utility of metagenomic sequencing as a tool in outbreak investigations. Additionally, this approach provides a means to broadly enrich for otherwise minute levels of modified DNA which may escape unnoticed in metagenomic samples.",

This can cause ferroptosis, which is an oxidative cell death process characterized by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation. Erastin and other ferroptosis inducers have been shown to affect metabolism but the metabolic effects of these drugs have not been systematically studied. To this end, we investigated how erastin impacts global metabolism in cultured cells and compared this metabolic profile to that caused by the ferroptosis inducer RSL3 or in-vivo cysteine deprivation. Common among the metabolic profiles were alterations in nucleotide and central carbon metabolism. Supplementing nucleosides to cysteine-deprived cells rescued cell proliferation in certain contexts, showing that these alterations to nucleotide metabolism can affect cellular fitness. While GPX4 inhibition caused a similar metabolic profile as cysteine deprivation, nucleoside treatment did not rescue cell viability or proliferation under RSL3 treatment, suggesting that these metabolic changes have varying importance in different scenarios of ferroptosis. Together, our study shows how global metabolism is affected during ferroptosis, and points to nucleotide metabolism as an important target of cysteine deprivation.",

    "abstract": "Patients with advanced congestive heart failure (CHF) or chronic kidney disease (CKD) often have increased systemic angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and cachexia. We previously demonstrated that Ang II infusion in rodents results in skeletal muscle wasting and reduced muscle regenerative potential via Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) signaling, potentially contributing to cachexia in CHF and CKD. Contrary to AT1R signaling, we found that signaling via Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) potentiates skeletal muscle satellite cell (SC) differentiation and muscle regenerative potential. However, mechanisms whereby AT2R regulates SC differentiation and cachexia development remain unknown. In this study, we found that GSK3{beta} activity was significantly suppressed during SC differentiation, whereas it was retained in SCs with AT2R knockdown. AT2R knockdown leads to higher GSK3{beta} and decreased {beta}-catenin activities both in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with GSK3{beta} inhibitor BIO restored {beta}-catenin activity and differentiation capacity of SCs with AT2R knockdown. Conversely, transgenic overexpression of AT2R in SCs inhibited GSK3{beta}, associated with increased {beta}-catenin activity and SC myogenic capacity both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, AT2R expression in undifferentiated SCs was regulated post-transcriptionally. An increase in systemic Ang II blunted AT2R induction during muscle regeneration. However, overexpression of AT2R restored AT2R levels and myogenesis in vivo. Together, these data suggest that the AT2R/GSK3{beta}/{beta}- catenin signaling pathway could serve as a potential therapeutic target to promote muscle regenerative capacity in chronic disease conditions characterized by heightened activation of the renin-angiotensin system, such as CHF and CKD.",

    "abstract": "CD47 is a ubiquitously expressed cell surface integrin-associated protein. Recently, we have demonstrated that integrin Mac-1 (M{beta}2, CD11b/CD18, CR3), the major adhesion receptor on the surface of myeloid cells, can be coprecipitated with CD47. However, the molecular basis for the CD47-Mac-1 interaction and its functional consequences remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that CD47 regulates macrophage functions directly interacting with Mac-1. In particular, adhesion, spreading, migration, phagocytosis, and fusion of CD47-deficient macrophages were significantly decreased. The functional link between CD47 and Mac-1 was validated by co-immunoprecipitation analysis using various Mac-1-expressing cells. In HEK293 cells expressing individual M and {beta}2 integrin subunits, CD47 has been found to bind both subunits. Interestingly, the amount of CD47 recovered with the free {beta}2 subunit was higher than in the complex with the whole integrin. Furthermore, activating Mac-1-expressing HEK293 cells with PMA, Mn2+, and activating antibody increased CD47 in complex with Mac-1, suggesting greater stability of the complex with integrin in the extended conformation. Notably, on the surface of cells lacking CD47, fewer Mac-1 molecules could convert into an extended conformation in response to activation. The binding site in CD47 for Mac-1 was identified in its constituent IgV domain. The complementary binding sites for CD47 in Mac-1 were localized in integrin epidermal growth factor-like domains 3 and 4 of the {beta}2 and calf-1 and calf-2 domains of the  subunits. These results indicate that Mac-1 forms a lateral complex with CD47, which regulates essential macrophage functions by stabilizing the extended integrin conformation.",

    "abstract": "Early endosomes (EEs) are central hubs for cargo sorting in vesicular trafficking. Cargoes destined for degradation retain in EEs that are eventually delivered to lysosomes, while recycled cargo destined for the plasma membrane (PM) or to the Golgi are segregated into EE buds, a specialized membrane structure transiently generated on EEs during cargo sorting. Until now, the molecular basis of the membrane expansion during the biogenesis of EE buds is completely elusive. Here, we identify a protein complex containing a Vps13 domain-containing lipid transporter SHIP164, ATPase RhoBTB3 and retromer component Vps26B, promotes the membrane expansion in the biogenesis of EE buds at Golgi-EE contacts. SHIP164 depletion specifically reduces the size and number of EE buds marked by Vps26B and actin, and results in less but enlarged EEs, which can be substantially rescued by wild type SHIP164 other than lipid transfer-defective mutants, suggesting a role of lipid transfer of SHIP164 in the process. SHIP164 and RhoBTB3 interact with enzymes for phospholipid synthesis on motile Golgi vesicles, that frequently contact EEs. Functionally, SHIP164 depletion substantially reduces the trafficking of sphingomyelin to the PM, and impairs cell growth. Together, we propose a lipid transport-dependent route from the Golgi to EEs at the contacts required for EE bud biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The protoplast experimental system has been becoming a powerful tool for functional genomics and cell fusion breeding. However, the physiology and molecular mechanism during enzymolysis is not completely understood and has become a major obstacle to protoplast regeneration. Our study used physiological, cytology, iTRAQ (Isobaric Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantification) -based proteomic and RT-PCR analyses to compare the young leaves of sugarcane (ROC22) and protoplasts of more than 90% viability. We found that oxidation product MDA content increased in the protoplasts after enzymolysis and several antioxidant enzymes such as POD, CAT, APX, and O2- content significantly decreased. The cytology results showed that after enzymolysis, the cell membranes were perforated to different degrees, the nuclear activity was weakened, the nucleolus structure was not obvious, and the microtubules depolymerized and formed many short rod-like structures in protoplasts. The proteomic results showed that 1,477 differential proteins were down-regulated and 810 were up-regulated after enzymolysis of sugarcane young leaves. The GO terms, KEGG and KOG enrichment analysis revealed that differentially abundant proteins were mainly involved in bioenergetic metabolism, cellular processes, osmotic stress, and redox homeostasis of protoplasts, which would allow protein biosynthesis or / degradation. The RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of osmotic stress resistance genes such as DREB, WRKY, MAPK4, and NAC were up-regulated. Meanwhile, the expression of key regeneration genes such as CyclinD3, CyclinA, CyclinB, Cdc2, PSK, CESA and GAUT were significantly down-regulated in the protoplasts. Hierarchical clustering, identification of redox proteins and oxidation products showed that these proteins were involved in dynamic networks in response to oxidative stress after enzymolysis. We used a variety of methods to figure out how young sugarcane leaves react to enzymes.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant mitochondrial homeostasis are key aspects of Parkinsons disease (PD) pathophysiology. Mutations in PINK1 and Parkin proteins lead to autosomal recessive PD, suggesting that defective mitochondrial clearance via mitophagy is key in PD etiology. Accelerating the identification and/or removal of dysfunctional mitochondria could therefore provide a disease-modifying approach to treatment. To that end, we performed a high-content phenotypic screen (HCS) of ~125,000 small molecules to identify compounds that positively modulate mitochondrial accumulation of the PINK1-Parkin-dependent mitophagy initiation marker p-Ser65-Ub in Parkin haploinsufficiency (Parkin +/R275W) human fibroblasts. Following confirmatory counter-screening and orthogonal assays, we selected compounds of interest that enhance mitophagy-related biochemical and functional endpoints in patient-derived fibroblasts. Identification of inhibitors of the ubiquitin-specific peptidase and negative regulator of mitophagy USP30 within our hits further validated our approach. The compounds identified provide a novel starting point for further investigation and optimisation.",

    "abstract": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a virus responsible for acute respiratory infection in humans with clinical and epidemiological relevance in pediatric, immunocompromised, and elderly populations. Little is known about hMPV in vitro replication biological processes and their relationship with cellular structures such as the cytoskeleton. Our goal was to evaluate the viral replication curve in order to study the role of the actin cytoskeleton in hMPV replication at different stages of viral growth. Human metapneumovirus was isolated in a Vero cell line from a clinical sample and identified as A2 genotype. The cytopathic effect was detected by the appearance of cell rounding and refractory cell clusters. The growth curve showed that viral replication maximum level was between 48 and 72 h.p.i. The highest percentage of infected cells and intracellular hMPV-protein were detected at the early stages of the replication cycle (8 h.p.i). Disruption of actin microfilaments with cytochalasin D (CytD) during the early events of infection provoked an increase in both intracellular and extracellular viruses. We demonstrate that the early phase of the hMPV curve is crucial for viral replication. We also show that disruption of actin filaments during this time increments both viral protein expression in the cytoplasm and the release of viruses to the extracellular space. This study contributes to elucidate wild-type hMPV growth kinetics, providing new insights on the actin cytoskeleton role in viral replication mechanisms. In addition, it points out putative targets to develop new antiviral treatments.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIdiopathic granulomatous mastitis (IGM) is a rare, chronic, and benign inflammatory breast disease with ambiguous aetiology. Contrastingly, lactational mastitis (LM) is commonly diagnosed in breastfeeding women. To investigate IGM aetiology, we profiled the microbial flora of pus and skin in IGM and LM patients.\n\nMethodsIGM patients were recruited from 2018 to 2020; LM patients were recruited as controls. 16S rRNA sequencing libraries were constructed from 16S rRNA gene amplified from total DNA extracted from pus and skin swabs. Metagenomic analysis was conducted using modified microbiome abundance analysis-suite customised R-resource for paired pus and skin samples. Microbiome multivariable association analyses were performed using linear models.\n\nResults21 IGM and 3 LM paired pus and skin samples underwent metagenomic analysis. Bray-Curtis ecological dissimilarity distance showed dissimilarity across four sample types (IGM-pus, IGM-skin, LM-pus, LM-skin; PERMANOVA, p<0.001). No characteristic dominant genus was observed across IGM samples. IGM pus samples were more diverse than corresponding IGM skin samples (Shannon and Simpson index; Wilcoxon paired signed-rank tests, p=0.022 and p=0.07). Corynebacterium kroppenstedtii, reportedly associated with IGM in literature, was higher in IGM pus samples than paired skin sample (Wilcoxon, p=0.022). Three other species and nineteen genera were statistically significant in paired IGM pus-skin comparison after antibiotic treatment adjustment, and multiple comparisons correction.\n\nConclusionsMicrobial profiles are unique between IGM and LM patients. Inter-patient variability and polymicrobial IGM pus samples cannot implicate specific genus or species as an infectious cause for IGM.",

    "abstract": "Stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) has been causing significant whole colony mortality on reefs in Florida and the Caribbean. The cause of SCTLD remains unknown, with limited concurrence of SCTLD-associated bacteria among studies. We conducted a meta-analysis of SSU 16S ribosomal RNA gene datasets generated by 16 field and laboratory SCTLD studies to find consistent bacteria associated with SCTLD across disease zones (vulnerable, endemic, and epidemic), coral species, coral compartments (mucus, tissue, and skeleton), and disease states (apparently healthy colony tissue [AH], and unaffected [DU] and lesion [DL] tissue from diseased colonies). We also evaluated bacteria in seawater and sediment, which may be sources of SCTLD transmission. Although AH colonies in endemic and epidemic zones harbor bacteria associated with SCTLD lesions, and aquaria and field samples had distinct microbial compositions, there were still clear differences in the microbial composition among AH, DU, and DL in the combined dataset. Alpha diversity between AH and DL was not different; however, DU showed increased alpha diversity compared to AH, indicating that, prior to lesion formation, corals may undergo a disturbance to the microbiome. This disturbance may be driven by Flavobacteriales, which were especially enriched in DU. While Rhodobacterales and Peptostreptococcales-Tissierellales were prominent in structuring microbial interactions in DL. Peptostreptococcales-Tissierellales specifically may contribute to lesion progression through an alpha-toxin. We provide a consensus of SCTLD-associated bacteria both prior to and during lesion progression and identify how these taxa vary across studies, coral species, coral compartments, seawater, and sediment.",

    "abstract": "Equine osteoarthritis is a heterogeneous, degenerative disease of the musculoskeletal system with multifactorial causation, characterised by a joint metabolic imbalance. Extracellular vesicles are nanoparticles involved in intracellular communication. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy is a form of regenerative medicine that utilises their properties to repair damaged tissues. Despite its wide use in veterinary practice, the exact mechanism of action of MSCs is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to determine the synovial fluid extracellular vesicle protein cargo following integrin 10{beta}1-selected mesenchymal stem cell treatment in an experimental model of equine osteoarthritis with longitudinal sampling. Adipose tissue derived, integrin 10-MSCs were injected into the osteoarthritis afflicted joint after 18 days post surgery. Sixty-nine synovial fluid samples were collected via aseptic arthrocentesis at day 0, 18, 21, 28, 35, and 70. Synovial fluid was hyaluronidase treated and extracellular vesicles isolated using differential ultracentrifugation. Extracellular vesicles were characterised using the Exoview human tetraspanin chip. Extracellular vesicle concentration, surface marker identification, fluorescent microscopy and tetraspanin colocalization analysis was undertaken, in conjunction with nanoparticle tracking analysis. For proteomics, extracellular vesicle pellets were suspended in urea lysis buffer. Samples were reduced, alkylated and digested on SP3 beads with trypsin/LysC. A data independent acquisition mode was utilised for nano liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry analysis on a Triple TOF 6600 mass spectrometer. A total of 442 proteins were identified across all samples, with 48 proteins differentially expressed (FDR[&le;] 0.05) between control and osteoarthritis treated with MSCs.. The most significant pathways following functional enrichment analysis of the differentially abundant protein dataset were serine endopeptidase activity (p=0.023), complement activation (classical pathway) (p=0.023), and collagen containing extracellular matrix (p=0.034). To date this is the first study to quantify the global extracellular vesicle proteome in synovial fluid following MSC treatment of osteoarthritis. Changes in the proteome of the synovial fluid-derived EVs following MSC injection suggest EVs may play a role in mediating the effect of cell therapy through altered joint homeostasis and an improved phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Cis-regulatory changes are thought to play a major role in adaptation. Threespine sticklebacks have repeatedly colonized freshwater habitats in the Northern Hemisphere, where they have evolved a suite of phenotypes that distinguish them from marine populations, including changes in physiology, behavior, and morphology. To understand the role of gene regulatory evolution in adaptive divergence, here we investigate cis-regulatory changes in gene expression between marine and freshwater ecotypes through allele-specific expression (ASE) in F1 hybrids. Surveying seven ecologically relevant tissues, including three sampled across two developmental stages, we identified cis-regulatory divergence affecting a third of genes, nearly half of which were tissue-specific. Next, we compared allele-specific expression in dental tissues at two timepoints to characterize cis-regulatory changes during development between marine and freshwater fish. Applying a genome-wide test for selection on cis-regulatory changes, we find evidence for lineage-specific selection on several processes, including the Wnt signaling pathway in dental tissues. Finally, we show that genes with ASE, particularly those that are tissue-specific, are enriched in genomic regions associated with marine-freshwater divergence, supporting an important role for cis-regulatory differences in adaptive evolution of sticklebacks. Altogether, our results provide insight into the cis-regulatory landscape of divergence between stickleback ecotypes and supports a fundamental role for cis-regulatory changes in rapid adaptation to new environments.",

    "abstract": "Escherichia coli O157:H7 (O157)-adulterated food products, including beef and produce, are associated with disease outbreaks in humans. Although cattle feces are a source for the contamination, it is unclear if diverse O157 human-associated outbreak isolates expressing a specific virulence phenotype can colonize and shed in the feces of cattle at a quantitatively similar levels to non-outbreak isolates. It is also unclear if other phenotypes, such as biofilm, cell attachment, and toxin production, differentiate environmental O157 isolates from O157 isolates associated with human illness. Genomic profiling of O157 isolates acquired through routine surveillance can inform if the isolates encode virulence genes associated with human disease, but many genotype-phenotype relationships remain unclear for O157. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare a diverse set of O157 isolates, with the intent of identifying potential genotypic differences that could inform phenotypes such as cattle colonization and fecal shedding, in vitro cell attachment, biofilm production, and Shiga toxin production. In addition, the relationship between phenotypes and potential for foodborne illness as it relates to genomic virulence traits was explored. No significant differences in cattle colonization and fecal shedding were detected for the tested isolates, despite broad genomic differences. In addition, the in vitro phenotypic differences noted in biofilm and cell attachment did not associate with one LSPA-6 lineage compared to another. Overall, no differences in cattle shedding were observed, yet variations in genotype and phenotype were identified indicating further work is warranted to better understand the relationship between O157 genome and virulence.\n\nImportanceFoodborne illness has a major impact on the health and wellbeing of the global population, besides creating substantial financial hardships for industry. While many bacteria and viruses are implicated in foodborne illness, Escherichia coli serotype O157:H7 (O157) is a common food adulterant that can cause human disease and food recalls. Cattle feces are a significant source of food-adulterating O157. A greater understanding of O157 genetics and its relation to phenotype is needed to develop mitigation strategies to limit spread of O157 into the food chain. The goal of the research was to identify O157 genomic and phenotypic attributes of O157 associated with cattle colonization and fecal shedding along with other factors involved in environmental persistence and illness in humans. It was observed that variations in biofilm formation and in vitro cellular adherence did not associate with enhanced cattle colonization or fecal shedding, indicating that the processes involved in cattle colonization are complex and not well understood.",

    "abstract": "At acidic pH, cytosine-rich single-stranded DNA can be folded into a tetraplex structure called i-motif (iM). In recent studies, the effect of monovalent cations on the stability of iM structures has been addressed, but a consensus about the issue has not been reached yet. Thus, we investigated the effects of various factors on the stability of iM structures using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based analysis for three types of iM derived from human telomere sequences. We confirmed that the iM structure is destabilized as the concentration of monovalent cations (Li+, Na+, K+) increases and that Li+ has the greatest tendency of destabilization. This cation-induced destabilization is rather unexpected and specific to the iM structure, considering the cations electrostatic effect of supporting DNA folding. Monovalent cations of different kinds promote the flexibility of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and the stability of folded DNA structures to different degrees, suggesting that the size of cation be a key factor in its function. All taken together, we conclude that the stability of iM structures is controlled by the subtle balance of the two counteractive effects of monovalent cations, electrostatic screening and disruption of cytosine base pairing.",

    "abstract": "The regulated abundance and spatial distribution of proteins determines cellular structure and function. The discovery of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and fusing it to a target protein to determine subcellular localization revolutionized cell biology. Most localization studies involve introducing additional copies of a target gene genetically fused to GFP and under the control of a constitutive promoter, resulting in the expression of the GFP-fusion protein at non-native levels. Here we have developed a single vector CRISPR/Cas9 guided GFP knock-in strategy in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana. This enables precise and scarless knock-in of GFP at the endogenous genomic location to create GFP fusion proteins under their native cis and trans regulatory elements with knock-in efficiencies of over 50%. We show that a previously uncharacterized bestrophin-like protein localizes to the CO2-fixing pyrenoid and demonstrate that by measuring GFP fluorescence we can track relative protein abundance in response to environmental change. To enable endogenous tagging, we developed a Golden Gate Molecular Cloning system for the rapid assembly of episomes for transformation into Thalassiosira pseudonana via bacterial conjugation. In addition, this versatile toolbox enables CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, provides a broad range of validated fluorophores and enables future large-scale functional studies in diatoms.\n\nSignificance statementFluorescent protein (FP) tagging is a widely utilized technique for understanding the spatial distribution of proteins. However, introducing extra gene copies under constitutive promoters that randomly integrate into the genome can result in non-biologically relevant expression levels, unwanted genomic mutations and localization artefacts. To overcome this, we developed a novel single vector system capable of CRISPR/Cas9-guided endogenous GFP tagging in a globally important model diatom. This allows scarless GFP knock-in at precise genomic locations resulting in GFP fusions regulated by native promoters/terminators, which facilitates accurate localization and determination of relative protein abundance. Moreover, the developed modular cloning framework is user-friendly and opens the door for high throughput large-scale studies, including FP tagging, knock-out, and knock-in.",

    "abstract": "More than half of all extant metazoan species on earth are insects. The evolutionary success of insects is intrinsically linked with their ability to osmoregulate, suggesting that they have evolved unique physiological mechanisms to maintain water balance. In beetles (Coleoptera)--the largest group of insects--a specialized rectal ( cryptonephridial) complex has evolved that recovers water from the rectum destined for excretion and recycles it back to the body. However, the molecular mechanisms underpinning the remarkable waterconserving functions of this system are unknown. Here, we introduce a transcriptomic resource, BeetleAtlas.org, for red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum, and demonstrate its utility by identifying a cation/H+ antiporter (NHA1) that is enriched and functionally significant in the Tribolium rectal complex. NHA1 localizes exclusively to a specialized cell type, the leptophragmata, in the distal region of the Malpighian tubules associated with the rectal complex. Computational modelling and electrophysiological characterization in Xenopus oocytes show that NHA1 acts as an electroneutral K+/H+ antiporter. Furthermore, genetic silencing of Nha1 dramatically increases excretory water loss and reduces organismal survival during desiccation stress, implying that NHA1 activity is essential for maintaining systemic water balance. Finally, we show that Tiptop, a conserved transcription factor, regulates NHA1 expression in leptophragmata and controls leptophragmata maturation, illuminating the developmental mechanism that establishes the novel functions of this cell. Together, our work provides the first insights into the molecular architecture underpinning the function of one most powerful water-conserving mechanisms in nature, the beetle rectal complex.\n\nSignificance StatementBeetles are the largest group of insects, inhabiting a wide range of habitats on earth. Unique adaptations in overcoming water stress is critical to their success, yet the mechanisms underpinning this ability are unknown. Using genetics, electrophysiology, imaging and behavioral studies we show that a cation/H+ (NHA1) transporter is exclusively localized to specialized cell type, the leptophragmata, in the Malpighian tubules associated with the rectal complex. Ion transport functions of NHA1 in leptophragmata underpin the movement of water from the rectum, from where it would be destined for excretion, to the Malpighian tubule and then recycled back to the body. This water recovery capability of rectal complex is essential for maintaining systemic water balance in beetles. This work provides the first insight into to the molecular architecture of one of most powerful water-conservation mechanisms in biology, and provides an important clue to the ecological and evolutionary success of the beetles.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) still remains the only licensed vaccine for TB and has been shown to provide nonspecific protection against unrelated pathogens. This has been attributed to the ability of BCG to modulate the innate immune system, known as trained innate immunity (TII). TII is associated with innate immune cells being in a hyper-responsive state leading to enhanced host defense against heterologous infections. Both epidemiological evidence and prospective studies demonstrate cutaneous BCG vaccine-induced TII provides enhanced innate protection against heterologous pathogens. Regardless of the extensive amounts of progress made thus far, the effect of cutaneous BCG vaccination against heterologous respiratory bacterial infections and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we show for the first time that s.c BCG vaccine-induced TII provides enhanced heterologous innate protection against pulmonary S. pneumoniae infection. We further demonstrate that this enhanced innate protection is mediated by accelerated neutrophilia in the lung and is independent of centrally trained circulating monocytes. New insight from this study will help design novel effective vaccination strategies against unrelated respiratory bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "About two thirds of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients develop anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPA), which are a characteristic of the disease and sparsely observed in other clinical settings or in the healthy population. ACPA are used as a diagnostic criterion and often develop prior to diagnosis. Therefore, ACPA titers are important in the identification of individuals at risk of developing RA. Interestingly, the titers and target cross-reactivity of ACPA increase by time of diagnosis, suggesting a causality between anti-citrulline reactivity and the development of RA. However, only 50% of ACPA-positive at-risk individuals will progress to a clinical RA diagnosis. This observation suggests that there are different types of ACPA and that their relationship with RA development is more complex than presently assumed.\n\nTo address the biological effect of ACPA in the establishment and development of inflammatory arthritis, we made use of the collagen antibody-induced arthritis (CAIA) model of passive arthritis. Using seven unique patient derived monoclonal ACPA, we observed that ACPA are predominantly anti-inflammatory, with some clones (C03 and BVCA1) completely inhibiting disease development. We have also identified a clone (C04) as having a disease-prone effect, by increasing and sustaining disease prevalence. This clone had previously been reported as being pro-inflammatory in a different model of joint inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effects of C03 were dependent on Fc{gamma}R, since neither F(ab)2 or a mutated Fc-null GRLR-C03 clone could mediate disease protection. Most importantly, mice receiving polyclonal ACPA enriched from RA sera were also partially protected from disease. Looking at the cell and tissue of origin of the ACPA clones, their V(D)J sequences, Fc glycosylation pattern and fine-specificities, we could not identify a common feature between anti-inflammatory ACPA distinguishing them from those without the properties. Together, our data demonstrates that circulating ACPA in RA patients are predominantly anti-inflammatory, emphasizing the need to study ACPA repertoires in order to determine their influence on the clinical outcome of the patient or at-risk individual.",

However, it is unclear if immune pathways act autonomously within the stem cell to direct the damage response pathway. We consider this an important question, as stem cell dynamics are essential for formation and maintenance of the entire epithelium. We used Drosophila to determine the impact of stem cell-specific loss of NF-{kappa}B on tissue regeneration upon chemical injury. We found that loss of NF-{kappa}B enhanced cell death, impaired enterocyte renewal and increased mortality. Mechanistically, we showed that the Ras/ERK pathway is essential for NF-{kappa}B-dependent maintenance of cell viability and tissue repair.

    "abstract": "Type 2 cytokines like IL-4 are hallmarks of helminth infection and activate macrophages to limit immunopathology and mediate helminth clearance. In addition to cytokines, nutrients and metabolites critically influence macrophage polarization. Choline is an essential nutrient known to support normal macrophage responses to lipopolysaccharide; however, its function in macrophages polarized by type 2 cytokines is unknown. Using murine IL-4-polarized macrophages, targeted lipidomics revealed significantly elevated levels of phosphatidylcholine, with select changes to other choline-containing lipid species. These changes were supported by the coordinated upregulation of choline transport compared to naive macrophages. Pharmacological inhibition of choline metabolism significantly suppressed several mitochondrial transcripts and dramatically inhibited select IL-4-responsive transcripts, most notably, Retnla. We further confirmed that blocking choline metabolism diminished IL-4-induced RELM (encoded by Retnla) protein content and secretion and caused a dramatic reprogramming toward glycolytic metabolism. To better understand the physiological implications of these observations, naive or mice infected with intestinal helminths Heligmosomoides polygyrus or Nippostrongylus brasiliensis were treated with the choline kinase  inhibitor, RSM-932A, to limit choline metabolism in vivo. Pharmacological inhibition of choline metabolism lowered RELM expression across cell-types and tissues and led to the disappearance of peritoneal macrophages and B-1 lymphocytes and an influx of infiltrating monocytes. The impaired macrophage activation was associated with some loss in optimal immunity to H. polygyrus with increased egg burden, but there were no differences in intestinal worm count nor differences in N. brasiliensis parasite burden. Together, these data demonstrate that choline metabolism is required for macrophage RELM induction, metabolic programming, and peritoneal immune homeostasis, which could have important implications in the context of other models of infection or cancer immunity.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510305v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2f83a3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16b74b1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba1f8dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6da06a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The Src family kinases (SFKs) Lck and Lyn are crucial for lymphocyte development and function. Albeit tissue-restricted expression patterns, the two kinases share common functions, the most pronounced one, being the phosphorylation of ITAM motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of antigenic receptors. Lck is predominantly expressed in T-lymphocytes; however, it can be ectopically found in B-1 cell subsets and numerous pathologies including acute and chronic B-cell leukemias. The exact impact of Lck on the B-cell signaling apparatus remains enigmatic and is followed by the long-lasting open question of mechanisms granting selectivity amongst SFK members. In this work we sought to investigate the mechanistic basis of ectopic Lck function in B-cells and compare it to events elicited by the predominant B-cell SFK, Lyn. Our results reveal substrate promiscuity displayed by the two SFKs, which however, is buffered by their differential susceptibility towards regulatory mechanisms, revealing a so far unappreciated aspect of SFK member-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, we show that Lck- and Lyn-generated signals suffice to induce transcriptome alterations, reminiscent of B-cell activation, in the absence of receptor/co-receptor engagement. Finally, our analyses revealed a yet unrecognized role of SFKs in tipping the balance of cellular stress responses, by promoting the onset of ER-phagy, an as yet completely uncharacterized process in B-lymphocytes.\n\nSignificanceThe Src-family-kinases Lck and Lyn are mandatory for lymphocyte function. However, several aspects of their regulation and critical pathways they control remain elusive. Using signaling and transcriptome analysis we show that the two kinases share substrate preferences; yet they display differential susceptibility towards regulatory mechanisms, revealing a so far unappreciated aspect of SFK member-specific fine-tuning. Furthermore, overexpression of both kinases suffices to induce receptor-ligation independent signaling responses. Finally, our analyses reveal a novel role of SFKs in tipping the balance of cellular stress responses, by promoting ER-phagy, in the expense of proteasomal degradation and the Unfolded Protein Response. These data advance our understanding of molecular individualities amongst SFK members, and identifies novel networks significant for lymphocyte activation and effector function.",

    "abstract": "Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is the most widely distributed tick-borne viral disease in humans. The virus is widely expanded across western China, South Asia, and the Middle East to southeastern Europe and Africa. Its causative agent, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), is among the deadliest human pathogens in Africa and Eurasia. The historical known distribution of the CCHFV vector Hyalomma marginatum in Europe included most of the Mediterranean and the Balkan countries, Ukraine, and southern Russia. Further expansion of its potential distribution is possibly occurred in and out of the Mediterranean region. This study updated the map of the principal vector of CCHFV, H. marginatum, in the Old World. The model estimated the environmental suitability of H. marginatum in the Old World, including Europe. On the continental European scale, the model anticipated a widespread potential distribution, covering southern, western, central, and eastern Europe, as far north as southern parts of Scandinavian countries. The distribution of H. marginatum also covered the countries across the central part of Europe where the species is not autochthonous. All models were statistically robust and performed better than random (p < 0.001). Based on the results of the model, climatic conditions could hamper the successful overwintering of H. marginatum and their survival as adults in many areas of the region. Regular updates of the models, using updated occurrence, current, and future climatic data are recommended to regularly assess the areas at risk.\n\nSummaryHyalomma marginatum is a vector of numerous highly important human and animal pathogens. It is the main vector of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in Europe. This study updated the potential distribution of H. marginatum on a global scale, including Europe, with a particular focus on Central Europe. The model predicted a widespread potential distribution of H. marginatum on the continental European scale, anticipating occurrences of H. marginatum in southern, western, central, and eastern Europe, as far north as southern parts of Scandinavian countries. In Central Europe, H. marginatum populations have not been established in any of the countries yet, but the presence of the species has been reported from all countries in the region. Their potential spread northwards and establishment of permanent populations of H. marginatum in the north are therefore of great importance, in particular since the immature stages of H. marginatum are frequently found on migratory birds flying northwards to temperate Europe. Our ecological niche model of H. marginatum in Central Europe anticipated its distribution in all countries of the region. Our prediction for current global potential distribution of this tick species can help in understanding disease risk areas associated with this vector.",

The tetraploid progenitor of sweetpotato is I. batatas 4x, donating the B2 subgenome, IbT-DNA1 and lineage 1 type of chloroplast genome. Sweetpotato derived from the reciprocal cross between the diploid and tetraploid progenitors and a subsequent whole genome duplication. We also detected biased gene exchanges between subgenomes.

    "abstract": "In the negative feedback loop driving the Neurospora circadian oscillator, the negative element, FREQUENCY (FRQ), inhibits its own expression by promoting phosphorylation of its heterodimeric transcriptional activators, White Collar-1 (WC-1) and WC-2. FRQ itself also undergoes extensive time-of-day-specific phosphorylation with over 100 phosphosites previously documented. Although disrupting individual or certain clusters of phosphorylation sites has been shown to alter circadian period lengths to some extent, how all the phosphorylations on FRQ control its activity is still elusive. In this study, we systematically investigated the role in period determination of all 110 phosphorylated residues reported on FRQ by mutagenetic and luciferase reporter assays. Surprisingly, robust FRQ phosphorylation is still detected even when 84 phosphosites were eliminated altogether; further mutating another 26 phosphoresidues completely abolished FRQ phosphorylation. To identify phosphoresidue(s) on FRQ impacting circadian period length, series of clustered frq phosphomutants covering all the 110 phosphosites were generated and examined for period changes. When phosphosites in the N-terminal and middle regions of FRQ were eliminated, longer periods were mostly seen while removal of phosphorylation in the C-terminal tail result in extremely short periods, among the shortest reported. Interestingly, abolishing the 11 phosphosites in the C-terminal tail of FRQ does not only result in an extremely short period, but also causes an over-compensated circadian oscillator under a range of physiological temperatures. When different groups of phosphomutations on FRQ were combined intramolecularly, an additive effect was observed as expected; unexpectedly, arrhythmicity resulting from one cluster frq phosphorylation mutants was restored by eliminating phosphorylation at another group of sites, suggesting an epistatic effect between phosphoevents.\n\nImportanceExisting in most eukaryotes, circadian clocks are built based on cell-autonomous, auto-regulatory feedback loops in which negative elements feed back to depress their own expression by repressing the positive elements that drive their synthesis. In Neurospora, the WCC transcription activator drives expression of FRQ, which complexes with FRH and CK1 to repress the DNA-binding activity of WCC by promoting phosphorylation at a group of residues of WCC. The phosphorylation status of FRQ determines the circadian period length, acting independent of effects of phosphorylation on FRQ half-life. Reflecting this dominant role of phosphorylation, FRQ is subject to substantial phosphorylation at over 100 sites in a time-of-day-specific manner. However, how this plethora of phosphoevents on FRQ controls its activity in a circadian cycle is still elusive, and prior work had shown limited effects of individual phosphosite point mutants. In this study, a series of frq mutants targeting multisite phosphorylation within domains of FRQ were generated and analyzed in order to define their roles in period determination. A clear pattern of period altering effects was observed in these frq mutants; certain mutants display strong temperature compensation phenotypes, and interestingly, a novel epistatic relationship on rhythmicity between phosphogroups emerged.",

    "abstract": "Linnaean and Wallacean shortfalls (Uncertainties on species taxonomy and distribution, respectively) are major factors hampering efficient conservation planning in the current context of biodiversity erosion. These shortfalls concern even widespread and abundant species in relatively well-studied regions such as the Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot which still hosts a large fraction of unrecognised biodiversity, notably in small vertebrates. Species delimitations have long been based on phylogenetic analyses of a small number of standard markers, but accurate lineage identification in this context can be obscured by incomplete lineage sorting, introgression or isolation by distance. Recently, integrative approaches coupling various sets of characters or analyses of contact zones aiming at estimating reproductive isolation (RI) have been advocated instead. Analyses of introgression patterns in contact zone with genomic data represent a powerful way to confirm the existence of independent lineages and estimate the strength of their RI at the same time. The Spiny-footed Lizard Acanthodactylus erythrurus (Schinz, 1833) is widespread in the Iberian Peninsula and the Maghreb and exhibits a large amount of genetic diversity, although the precise number and distribution of its genetic lineages remain poorly understood. We applied a RADseq approach to obtain a genome wide SNPs dataset on a contact zone in central Morocco between the previously described Rif and Middle-Atlas lineages. We show that these two lineages exhibit strong RI across this contact zone, as shown by the limited amount and restricted spatial extant of gene flow. We interpret these results as evidence for species-level divergence of these two lineages. Our study confirms the usefulness of RADseq approaches applied on contact zones for cryptic diversity studies and therefore to resolve Linnaean and Wallacean shortfalls.",

The Tide search engine separates the creation of the peptide index from the database search step, thereby saving time by allowing a peptide index to be reused in multiple searches. Here we describe an improved implementation of the indexing component of Tide that consumes around four times less resources (CPU and RAM) than the previous version and can generate arbitrarily large peptide databases, limited by only the amount of available disk space. We use this improved implementation to explore the relationship between database size and the parameters controlling digestion and PTMs, as well as database size and statistical power.

    "abstract": "Research on protein-protein interaction (PPIs) tends to focus on high affinity interactions. Weaker interactions (Kd >1M) recently understood as contributing to intracellular phase separation suggest that even-weaker PPIs might also matter in as-yet unknown ways. However, ultra-weak PPIs (Kd >1mM) are not readily accessible by in vivo techniques. Here we use protein electrostatics to estimate PPI strengths and spatially-resolved dynamic simulations to investigate the potential impacts of ultra-weak PPIs within dense protein suspensions. We find that ultra-weak PPIs can drive formation of transient clusters that last long enough to enable enzyme-catalyzed reactions and accelerate the sampling of protein associations. We apply our method to Mycoplasma genitalium, finding that ultra-weak PPIs should be ubiquitous among cytoplasmic proteins. We also predict that the proteome-wide interactome can be shifted to favor  binding-dominant ultra-weak PPIs via the introduction of a few charged protein complexes. We speculate that ultra-weak PPIs could contribute to cellular fitness by facilitating sampling and colloidal-scale transport of proteins involved in biological processes, including protein synthesis.",

    "abstract": "The vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family of cytokines are key drivers of blood vessel growth and remodeling. These ligands act via multiple VEGF receptors (VEGFR) and co-receptors such as Neuropilin (NRP) expressed on endothelial cells. These membrane-associated receptors are not solely expressed on the cell surface, they move between the surface and intracellular locations, where they can function differently. The location of the receptor alters its ability to see (access and bind to) its ligands, which regulates receptor activation; location also alters receptor exposure to subcellularly localized phosphatases, which regulates its deactivation. Thus, receptors in different subcellular locations initiate different signaling, both in terms of quantity and quality. Similarly, the local levels of co-expression of other receptors alters competition for ligands. Subcellular localization is controlled by intracellular trafficking processes, which thus control VEGFR activity; therefore, to understand VEGFR activity, we must understand receptor trafficking. Here, for the first time, we simultaneously quantify the trafficking of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and NRP1 on the same cells - specifically human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). We build a computational model describing the expression, interaction, and trafficking of these receptors, and use it to simulate cell culture experiments. We use new quantitative experimental data to parameterize the model, which then provides mechanistic insight into the trafficking and localization of this receptor network. We show that VEGFR2 and NRP1 trafficking is not the same on HUVECs as on non-human ECs; and we show that VEGFR1 trafficking is not the same as VEGFR2 trafficking, but rather is faster and weighted to intracellular expression, due to faster internalization and lower recycling, resulting in increased overall degradation. As a consequence, the VEGF receptors are not evenly distributed between the cell surface and intracellular locations, with a very low percentage of VEGFR1 being on the cell surface. Our findings have implications both for the sensing of extracellular ligands and for the composition of signaling complexes at the cell surface versus inside the cell.",

    "abstract": "Background and AimsSoybean (Glycine max (L.) Merrill) stands out as the major source of protein and oil for human and animal nutrition. Nevertheless, the increase in soybean yield has been accompanied by a reduction in its protein content in the last few decades. Since this might be influenced by the elemental composition of the seeds, we herein aimed at determining the profile of mineral nutrients and protein of 95 soybean varieties broadly cultivated in Brazil, the worlds biggest soybean producer and exporter, to identify possible nutritional triggers for the protein content.\n\nMethodsEnergy dispersive fluorescence spectroscopy (EDXRF) was employed to determine the concentration of macro, i.e., (K), phosphorus (P), sulphur (S), calcium (Ca), and micronutrients, i.e., iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu). The protein content was evaluated in soybean seeds by the Dumas method. The correlational and clustering assessment between nutrients and protein were determined through both univariate and multivariate non-parametric tests.\n\nResultsBoth protein and nutrient concentrations are not homogeneous across soybean seed varieties, and a clear positive association between protein and sulphur (S), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) concentrations were observed.\n\nConclusionThe recorded results suggest that sulphur (S), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) are the limiting nutrients for higher protein content in soybean seeds.",

    "abstract": "The cyclic oligoadenylates (cOAs) act as second messengers of type III CRISPR immunity system through activating the auxiliary nucleases for indiscriminate RNA degradation. The cOA-degrading nucleases (ring nucleases) provide an  off-switch regulation of the signaling, thereby preventing cell dormancy or cell death. Here, we describe the crystal structures of the CRISPR-associated ring nuclease 1 (Crn1) from Saccharolobus solfataricus (Sso) 2081 in its apo or bound to cA4 in both pre-cleavage and transient intermediate states. Sso2081 harbors a unique helical insert that encloses cA4 in the central cavity. Two free phosphates symmetrically bind the catalytic site of apo Sso2081 and overlap with the two scissile phosphates of cA4, supporting a bilaterally symmetrical cleavage. The structure of transient intermediate state captured by Ser11Ala mutation immediately illustrates a stepwise cleavage of cA4 by Sso2081. Our study establishes atomic mechanisms of cA4 recognition and degradation by the type III CRISPR ring nuclease Crn1/Sso2081.",

    "abstract": "Studies in multiple organisms have shown that aging is accompanied by several molecular phenotypes that include dysregulation of chromatin. Since chromatin regulates DNA-based processes such as transcription, alterations in chromatin modifications could impact the transcriptome and function of aging cells. In flies, as in mammals, the aging eye undergoes changes in gene expression that correlate with declining visual function and increased risk of retinal degeneration. However, the causes of these transcriptome changes are poorly understood. Here, we profiled chromatin marks associated with active transcription in the aging Drosophila eye to understand how chromatin modulates transcriptional outputs. We found that both H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 globally decrease across all actively expressed genes with age. However, we found no correlation with changes in differential gene expression. Downregulation of the H3K36me3 methyltransferase Set2 in young photoreceptors revealed significant changes in splicing events that overlapped significantly with those observed in aging photoreceptors. These overlapping splicing events impacted multiple genes involved in phototransduction and neuronal function. Since proper splicing is essential for visual behavior, and because aging Drosophila undergo a decrease in visual function, our data suggest that H3K36me3 plays a role in maintaining visual function in the aging eye through regulating alternative splicing.",

    "abstract": "In engineered living materials (ELMs) non-living matrices encapsulate microorganisms to acquire capabilities like sensing or biosynthesis. The confinement of the organisms to the matrix and the prevention of overgrowth and escape during the lifetime of the material is necessary for the application of ELMs into real devices. In this study, a bilayer thin film hydrogel of Pluronic F127 and Pluronic F127 acrylate polymers supported on a solid substrate is introduced. The inner hydrogel layer contains genetically engineered bacteria and supports their growth, while the outer layer acts as an envelope and does not allow leakage of the living organisms outside of the film for at least 15 days. Due to the flat and transparent nature of the construct, the thin layer is suited for microscopy and spectroscopy-based analyses. The composition and properties of the inner and outer layer are adjusted independently to fulfil viability and confinement requirements. We demonstrate that bacterial growth and light-induced protein production are possible in the inner layer and their extent is influenced by the crosslinking degree of the used hydrogel. Bacteria inside the hydrogel are viable long term, they can act as lactate-sensors and remain active after storage in phosphate buffer at room temperature for at least 3 weeks. The versatility of bilayer bacteria thin-films is attractive for fundamental studies and for the development of application-oriented ELMs.",

    "abstract": "Ongoing cell replacement studies and clinical trials have demonstrated the need to control donor and newborn cell behavior within their target tissue. Here we present a methodology to guide stem cell-derived and endogenously regenerated neurons by engineering the microenvironment. Being an \"approachable part of the brain,\" the eye provides a unique opportunity to study donor neuron fate, migration, and integration within the central nervous system. Glaucoma and other optic neuropathies lead to the permanent loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) - the neurons in the retina that transfer all visual information from the eye to the brain. Cell transplantation and transdifferentiation strategies have been proposed to restore RGCs, and one of the significant barriers to successful RGC integration into the existing retinal circuitry is cell migration towards their natural position in the retina. Here we describe a framework for identifying, selecting, and applying chemokines to direct cell migration in vivo within the retina. We have performed an in silico analysis of the single-cell transcriptome of the developing human retina and identified six receptor-ligand candidates to guide stem cell-derived or newborn neurons. The lead candidates were then tested in functional in vitro assays for their ability to guide stem cell-derived RGCs. For the in vivo studies, donor and newborn neurons were differentiated in human and mouse retinal organoids or endogenously reprogrammed with proneuronal transcription factors, respectively. An exogenous stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF1) gradient led to a 2.7-fold increase in donor RGC migration into the ganglion cell layer and a 3.3-fold increase in the displacement of newborn RGCs out of the inner nuclear layer. Furthermore, by altering the migratory profile of donor RGCs toward multipolar migration, overall migration was improved in mature retinal tissues. Together, these results highlight the ability and importance of engineering the tissue microenvironment and the individual cells for research and clinical applications in gene and cell therapies.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=175 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510158v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (62K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1856140org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3ca26org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9c9b34org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19187c0_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG In brief, the \"in silico - in vitro - in vivo\" funnel holds significant potential for identifying targets to control cellular processes in research and clinical applications.
