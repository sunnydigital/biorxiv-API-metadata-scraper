    "abstract": "Flowering plants have evolved an extraordinary variety of signaling traits to attract and guide their pollinators. Most flowers rely on visual and chemical signals, but some bat-pollinated plants have evolved reflective surfaces to acoustically guide echolocating bats. All known acoustic flower signals rely on the same principle of increased sonar reflectivity. Here we describe a novel mechanism through which plants can make flowers acoustically conspicuous, a principle that relies on increased absorption of the area surrounding the flower. In a bat-pollinated columnar cactus (Espostoa frutescens) we found a hairy inflorescence zone, a so called cephalium. Flowers solely emerge out of this zone. We measured the ultrasound echoes of cephalia, flowers and unspecialized column surfaces and recorded echolocation calls of approaching bats. We found that the cephalium acts as strong ultrasound absorber, attenuating the sound by -14 dB compared to other parts of the column. The absorption was highest around the echolocation call frequencies of approaching bats. Our results indicate that, instead of making flowers more reflective, plants can also evolve structures to attenuate the background echo, thereby enhancing the acoustic contrast with the target. Similar sound absorbing mechanisms may be found in other species that interact with bats across a wide range of ecological contexts.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial genome encodes core subunits involved in the process of oxidative phosphorylation. The sequence and structure of these mitochondria-encoded polypeptides are expected to be shaped by bioenergetic requirements linked to diet and environment. Here, we have developed a robust and effective method for highlighting phylogenetic tree edges with unexpectedly rapid, and likely consequential, substitutions within mitochondrial proteins. Further, our approach allows detection of discrete protein substitutions likely to alter enzyme performance. A survey of mammalian taxonomic groups performed using our method indicates that widely conserved residues in mitochondria-encoded proteins are more likely to rapidly mutate toward variants providing lower OXPHOS activity within specific clades. Intriguingly, our data suggest reduced cellular metabolism of ancestral anthropoids, and our findings have potential implications regarding primate encephalization.\n\nSignificance StatementMitochondria harbor DNA (mtDNA) that encodes proteins important for converting food into energy. The environment and lifestyle of an organism shapes, and is shaped by, the sequences of these mitochondrial genomes. We developed a new approach for the detection of rapid functional change to proteins, and we applied our method to the mitochondria-encoded polypeptides of mammals. We found that primates displayed a general signature of relative hypometabolism that is shared with other mammals characterized by a low metabolic rate. Indications of reduced cellular metabolism extend even to the earliest anthropoids. Our findings have potential implications regarding the evolution of an enlarged primate brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSnails and slugs were used as a treatment for many health problems therefore ancient times. Since the antimicrobial resistance became a major global thread, antimicrobial peptides have been considered as a potential source for development of new drugs, especially for drug-resistant bacteria. Nowadays reports confirm that the mucous secretions have antimicrobial, antiviral and antifungal properties.\n\nMethodsThe present study has the objective to characterize and evaluate antimicrobial peptides of Limacus flavus mucus. The mucus was obtained by thermal shock and submitted to RP-HPLC. Fractions were used to perform the antimicrobial activity and hemolytic assays, electrophoresis (SDS-Page Gel) and submitted to mass spectrometry (LC-MS / MS). Identification and characterization was performed by PeaksX+ software. The physicochemical parameters were evaluated with bioinformatics tools, which predicted water solubility, iso-electric point, charge net and its primary structure.\n\nResultsThree fractions were isolated from the mucus of L. flavus and presented antifungal and antibacterial activity. The mucus showed greater inhibition for filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger), yeast (Cryptococcus neoformans), Gram positive bacteria (Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus) and Gram negative bacteria (Enterobacter cloacae). These fractions also did not show hemolytic activity for human blood cells (erythrocytes). Fractions sequences were identified and presents Mw <3kDa, WLGH, DLQW, YLRW, respectively.\n\nConclusionThis study revealed three antimicrobial peptides of L. flavus mucus with a wide range of antimicrobial activity and its physic-chemical characterization.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor protein p53 is situated in the midst of a complex network that is activated in response to cellular stress. An unresolved question is how p53 activates its myriad target genes in response to the severity of the stress signal and consequently coordinates the functional outcome in a timely manner. We have previously shown that DNA torsional flexibility distinguishes among p53 response elements (REs). Here we calculated the flexibility of over 200 p53 REs. By connecting functional pathways of p53-dependent genes to the calculated flexibility of their REs, we show that genes belonging to pathways activated rapidly upon stress (e.g., cell-cycle arrest, energy metabolism and innate immunity) contain REs that are significantly more flexible relative to REs of genes involved in pathways that need to be more strictly regulated or are activated later in the response to stress (e.g., intrinsic apoptosis and p53 negative regulation). The global structural properties of several p53 REs belonging to the different pathways were experimentally validated. Additionally, reporter gene expression driven by flexible p53 REs occurred at lower p53 levels and with faster rates than expression from rigid REs. Moreover, analysis of published endogenous mRNA levels of p53 target genes as a function of the flexibility of their REs support our hypothesis. Overall, we demonstrate that DNA flexibility of p53 REs contributes significantly to the timely expression of p53 target genes and thereby plays an important role in cell-faith decisions in the p53 circuity.",

    "abstract": "Plant pathogens secrete proteins, known as effectors, that function in the apoplast or inside plant cells to promote virulence. Effector detection by cell-surface or cytosolic receptors results in the activation of defence pathways and plant immunity. Despite their importance, our general understanding of fungal effector function and detection by immunity receptors remains poor. One complication often associated with effectors is their high sequence diversity and lack of identifiable sequence motifs precluding prediction of structure or function. In recent years, several studies have demonstrated that fungal effectors can be grouped into structural classes, despite significant sequence variation and existence across taxonomic groups. Using protein x-ray crystallography, we identify a new structural class of effectors hidden within the secreted in xylem (SIX) effectors from Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici (Fol). The recognised effectors Avr1 (SIX4) and Avr3 (SIX1) represent the founding members of the Fol dual-domain (FOLD) effector class, with members containing two distinct domains. Using AlphaFold2, we predicted the full SIX effector repertoire of Fol and show that SIX6 and SIX13 are also FOLD effectors, which we validated experimentally for SIX6. Based on structural prediction and comparisons, we show that FOLD effectors are present within three divisions of fungi and are expanded in pathogens and symbionts. Further structural comparisons demonstrate that Fol secretes a limited number of structurally related effectors during infection of tomato. This analysis also revealed a structural relationship between transcriptionally co-regulated effector pairs. We make use of the Avr1 structure to understand its recognition by the I receptor, which lead to disease resistance in tomato. This study represents an important advance in our understanding of Fol-tomato, and by extension plant-fungal interactions, which will assist the development of novel control and engineering strategies to combat plant pathogens.",

It remains unknown whether these non-uniformities are reflected in the large-scale organization of the early visual system and what benefits such adaptations would confer. Here, by relying on the efficient coding hypothesis, we predict that changes in the structure of receptive fields across visual space increase the efficiency of sensory coding. We show experimentally that, in agreement with our predictions, receptive fields of retinal ganglion cells change their shape along the dorsoventral retinal axis, with a marked surround asymmetry at the visual horizon. Our work demonstrates that, according to principles of efficient coding, the panoramic structure of natural scenes is exploited by the retina across space and cell-types.",

    "abstract": "Close-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods have recently been used to infer demographic parameters such as census population size and survival for fish of interest to fisheries and conservation. These methods have advantages over traditional mark-recapture methods as the mark is genetic, removing the need for physical marking and recapturing that may interfere with parameter estimation. For mosquitoes, the spatial distribution of close-kin pairs has been used to estimate mean dispersal distance, of relevance to vector-borne disease transmission and novel biocontrol strategies. Here, we extend CKMR methods to the life history of mosquitoes and comparable insects. We derive kinship probabilities for mother-offspring, father-offspring, full-sibling and half-sibling pairs, where an individual in each pair may be a larva, pupa or adult. A pseudo-likelihood approach is used to combine the marginal probabilities of all kinship pairs. To test the effectiveness of this approach at estimating mosquito demographic parameters, we develop an individual-based model of mosquito life history incorporating egg, larva, pupa and adult life stages. The simulation labels each individual with a unique identification number, enabling close-kin relationships to be inferred for sampled individuals. Using the dengue vector Aedes aegypti as a case study, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased estimates of adult census population size, adult and larval mortality rates, and larval life stage duration for logistically feasible sampling schemes. Considering a simulated population of 3,000 adult mosquitoes, estimation of adult parameters is accurate when ca. 40 adult females are sampled biweekly over a three month period. Estimation of larval parameters is accurate when adult sampling is supplemented with ca. 120 larvae sampled biweekly over the same period. The methods are also effective at detecting intervention-induced increases in adult mortality and decreases in population size. As the cost of genome sequencing declines, CKMR holds great promise for characterizing the demography of mosquitoes and comparable insects of epidemiological and agricultural significance.\n\nAuthor summaryClose-kin mark-recapture (CKMR) methods are a genetic analogue of traditional mark-recapture methods in which the frequency of marked individuals in a sample is used to infer demographic parameters such as census population size and mean dispersal distance. In CKMR, the mark is a close-kin relationship between individuals (parents and offspring, siblings, etc.). While CKMR methods have mostly been applied to aquatic species to date, opportunities exist to apply them to insects and other terrestrial species. Here, we explore the application of CKMR to mosquitoes, with Aedes aegypti, a primary vector of dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever, as a case study. By analyzing simulated Ae. aegypti populations, we find the CKMR approach provides unbiased estimates of adult census population size, adult and larval mortality rates, and larval life stage duration, and may be informative of intervention impact. Optimal sampling schemes are compatible with Ae. aegypti ecology and field studies. This study represents the first theoretical exploration of the application of CKMR to an insect species, and demonstrates its potential for characterizing the demography of insects of epidemiological and agricultural importance.",

While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard for causal inference, they are unethical in many scenarios. Mendelian randomization (MR) can be used in such cases, but importantly both RCTs and MR assume unidirectional causality. In this paper, we developed a new model, MRDoC2, that can be used to identify bidirectional causation in the presence of confounding due to both familial and non- familial sources. Our model extends the MRDoC model (Minic[a] et al 2018), by simultaneously including risk scores for each trait. Furthermore, the power to detect causal effects in MRDoC2 does not require the phenotypes to have different additive genetic or shared environmental sources of variance, as is the case in the direction of causation twin model (Heath et al., 1993).",

In making such inferences from morphogen profiles, cells must contend with inherent stochasticity in morphogen production, transport, sensing and signalling. Motivated by the multitude of signalling mechanisms in various developmental contexts, we show how cells may utilise multiple tiers of processing (compartmentalisation) and parallel branches (multiple receptor types), together with feedback control, to bring about fidelity in morphogenetic decoding of their positions within a developing tissue. By simultaneously deploying specific and nonspecific receptors, cells achieve a more accurate and robust inference. We explore these ideas in the patterning of Drosophila melanogaster wing imaginal disc by Wingless morphogen signalling, where multiple endocytic pathways participate in decoding the morphogen gradient. The geometry of the inference landscape in the high dimensional space of parameters provides a measure for robustness and delineates stiff and sloppy directions. This distributed information processing at the scale of the cell highlights how local cell autonomous control facilitates global tissue scale design.",

We first use TDM to characterize the current boundaries of cancer treatment complexity and find that the current complexity limit for clinical trials is 6 drugs per plan and for pre-clinical research is 10. We then present a TDM based assistive technology, cancer plan builder (CPB), which we make publicly available and allows experts to create literature-anchored high complexity combination treatment (HCCT) plans of significantly larger size. We develop metrics to evaluate HCCT plans and show that experts using CPB are able to create HCCT plans at much greater speed and quality, compared to experts without CPB. We hope that by releasing CPB we enable more researchers to engage with HCCT planning and demonstrate its clinical efficacy.",

Yet, past brain-wide association studies, particularly using large developmental samples, limit their focus to the coarse connectome to understand the neural underpinnings of individual differences in cognition. We examine resting-state fMRI (n=1,115 children, 389 twin pairs) and use hyperalignment to access reliable information in the fine-scale connectome. Though individual differences in the fine-scale connectome are more reliable than those in the coarse-scale, they are less heritable. Further, the alignment and scale of connectomes influence their ability to predict behavior: both scales equally predict more heritable cognitive traits, but the fine-scale connectome predicts less heritable traits significantly better than the coarse-scale.",

    "abstract": "Acute cellular stress is known to induce a global reduction in protein translation through suppression of cap dependent translation. However, selective translation in response to acute stress has been shown to play important roles in regulating the stress response. An accurate transcriptome-wide profile of acute cellular stress-induced translational changes has been challenging to obtain. Commonly used data normalization methods, such as quantile normalization, operate based on the assumption that any systematic shifts are artifacts introduced from experimental procedures. Consequently, if applied to profiling acute cellular stress-induced protein translation changes, these methods are expected to produce biased estimates. To address this issue, here we designed, generated, and evaluated a panel of 16 oligomers to serve as external standards for ribosome profiling studies. Using Sodium Arsenite treatment-induced oxidative stress in lymphoblastoid cell lines as a model system, we applied spike-in oligomers as external standards based on quantifications of monosomal RNA extracted from each sample. We found our spike-in oligomers to display a linear correlation between the observed and the expected, with small but significant ratio compression at the lower concentration range, and span the expected quantitative range in the observed data, which covers 97 % of the quantitated endogenous genes. We found popular global scaling normalization approaches to introduce both high levels of false positives and false negatives in differential expression analysis. Using the expected fold changes constructed from spike-in external controls, we found in our dataset that TMM normalization produced 87.5% false positives when a P value cutoff of 0.1 is used (i.e. 10% expected false positive rate)% and on average produced a systematic shift of fold change by 3.25 fold. These results highlight the consequences of applying global scaling approaches to conditions that clearly violate their key assumptions. As an alternative, we found using spike-in quantifications as control genes in RUVg normalization recapitulated the expected stress induced global reduction of translation and resulted in little, if any, systematic shifts in spike-in constructed true positives. Finally, using spike-in constructed true positives and true negatives, we explored alternative normalization approaches for acute cellular stress response ribo-seq studies. We found that a simple approach that quantile normalized data from control and treated samples separately, which we termed respective quantile normalization, produced expected results in spike-in quantification, and resulted in little, if any, systematic bias on fold change in endogenous genes. Additionally, we found that under certain parameters, using endogenous control genes for RUVg normalization best recapitulate the expected. Our results clearly demonstrated the utility of our spike-in oligomers, both for constructing expected results as controls and for data normalization. Our exploration of different normalization approaches highlights the issues in applying global scaling normalization when key assumptions are clearly not met. We show that a respective quantile normalization approach or normalization with endogenous control genes are viable options worth considering as more generalizable approaches for stress response ribo-seq studies. This conclusion is likely applicable to other types of studies that involve global shifts in expression profiles between comparison groups of interests.",

A human mutation (E326D) in the parallel coiled-coil formed by the signalling helices of AC9 dramatically increased basal activity, which was also dependent on the C2b domain. Intriguingly, the same mutation enabled stimulation of AC9 by GsRs. In summary, auto-regulation by the C2b domain of AC9 sustains its basal activity and quenches activation by GsR. Thus AC9 appears to be tailored to support constitutive activation of cyclic AMP effector systems. A switch from this paradigm to stimulation by GsRs may be occasioned by conformation changes at the coiled-coil or removal of the C2b domain.",

    "abstract": "The Elastic Network Contact Model (ENCoM) is a coarse-grained normal mode analysis (NMA) model unique in its all-atom sensitivity to the sequence of the studied macromolecule and thus to the effect of mutations. We adapted ENCoM to simulate the dynamics of ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules, benchmarked its performance against other popular NMA models and used it to study the 3D structural dynamics of human microRNA miR-125a, leveraging high-throughput data on the maturation efficiency of over 26 000 sequence variants. We also introduce a novel way of using dynamical information from NMA to train multivariate linear regression models, with the purpose of highlighting the most salient contributions of dynamics to function. ENCoM has a similar performance profile on RNA than on proteins when compared to the Anisotropic Network Model (ANM), the most widely used coarse-grained NMA model; it has the advantage on predicting large-scale motions while ANM performs better on B-factors prediction. A stringent benchmark from the miR-125a maturation dataset, in which the training set contains no sequence information in common with the testing set, reveals that ENCoM is the only tested model able to capture signal beyond the sequence. This ability translates to better predictive power on a second benchmark in which sequence features are shared between the train and test sets. When training the linear regression model using all available data, the dynamical features identified as necessary for miR-125a maturation point to known patterns but also offer new insights into the biogenesis of microRNAs. Our novel approach combining NMA with multivariate linear regression is generalizable to any macromolecule for which relatively high-throughput mutational data is available.\n\nAvailabilityENCoM is open source software part of the NRGTEN package available at https://github.com/gregorpatof/nrgten_package\n\nContactrafael.najmanovich@umontreal.ca, francois.major@umontreal.ca",

However, Dux-knockout embryos produce fertile mice, suggesting that ZGA is redundantly driven by an unknown factor(s). In the present study, we present multiple lines of evidence that the multicopy mouse homeobox gene, Obox4, encodes a transcription factor that is highly expressed in mouse 2-cell embryos and redundantly drives ZGA. Single depletion of Obox4 or Dux is tolerated by embryogenesis, whereas Obox4/Dux double depletion completely compromises embryonic development. Genome-wide epigenetic profiling revealed that OBOX4 binds to MERVL LTRs as well as a subset of murine endogenous retroviruses with lysine tRNA primer (MERVK) LTRs, and mediates the deposition of active histone modifications. Our study identified OBOX4 as a transcription factor that provides genetic redundancy to pre-implantation development.",

    "abstract": "Epithelial cells lining a gland and cells grown in a soft extracellular matrix polarize with apical proteins exposed to the lumen and basal proteins in contact with the extracellular matrix. Alterations to polarity, including an apical-out polarity, occur in human cancers. While some aberrant polarity states may result from altered protein trafficking, recent observations of an extraordinary tissue-level inside-out unfolding suggest an alternate pathway for altered polarity. Because mechanical alterations are common in human cancer including an upregulation of RhoA mediated actomyosin tension in acinar epithelia, we explored whether perturbing mechanical homeostasis could cause apical-out eversion. Acinar eversion was robustly induced by direct activation of RhoA in normal and tumor epithelial acini, or indirect activation of RhoA through blockage of {beta}1 integrins, disruption of the LINC complex, oncogenic Ras activation, or Rac1 inhibition. Furthermore, laser ablation of a portion of the untreated acinus was sufficient to induce eversion. Analyses of acini revealed high curvature and low phosphorylated myosin in the apical cell surfaces relative to the basal surfaces. A vertex-based mathematical model which balances tension at cell-cell interfaces revealed a five-fold greater basal cell surface tension relative to the apical cell surface tension. The model suggests that the difference in surface energy between the apical and basal surfaces is the driving force for acinar eversion. Our findings raise the possibility that a loss of mechanical homeostasis may cause apical-out polarity states in human cancers.",

We developed an approach to assess quantitative limitations for each population by applying entropy-based detection limits that incorporate both read distribution and coverage and setting read depth variability thresholds to detect and correct quantification errors caused by non-specific mapping and assembly errors. We applied the approach to quantify viruses in wastewater viral metagenomes, including pathogens and bacteriophages. Concentrations of total DNA viruses in wastewater influent and effluent were greater than 1010 gc/mL. Human-associated DNA viruses were detected and quantifiable with QuantMeta thresholds, including polyomavirus, papillomavirus, adenovirus, and crAss-like phages at concentrations similar to previous reports. Reads mapped to the genomes of several additional human viruses but these failed to exceed detection thresholds despite a sequencing depth of 200 million reads per sample. Our results highlight the high detection thresholds of quantitative metagenomics (500 gc/L) compared to PCR-based quantification (~10 gc/L).

    "abstract": "Marine sponges have recently been recognised as natural samplers of environmental DNA (eDNA) due to their effective water filtration and their ubiquitous, sessile and regenerative nature. However, laboratory workflows for metabarcoding of sponge tissue have not been optimised to ensure that these natural samplers achieve their full potential for community survey. We used a phased approach to investigate the influence of DNA isolation procedures on the biodiversity information recovered from sponges. In Phase 1, we compared three treatments of residual ethanol preservative in sponge tissue alongside five DNA extraction protocols. The results of Phase 1 informed which ethanol treatment and DNA extraction protocol should be used in Phase 2, where we assessed the effect of starting tissue mass on extraction success and whether homogenisation of sponge tissue is required. Phase 1 results indicated that ethanol preservative may contain unique and/or additional biodiversity information to that present in sponge tissue, but blotting tissue dry generally recovered more taxa and generated more sequence reads from the wild sponge species. Tissue extraction protocols performed best in terms of DNA concentration, taxon richness and proportional read counts, but the non-commercial tissue protocol was selected for Phase 2 due to cost-efficiency and greater recovery of target taxa. In Phase 2 overall, we found that homogenisation may not be required for sponge tissue and more starting material does not necessarily improve taxon detection. These results combined provide an optimised DNA isolation procedure for sponges to enhance marine biodiversity assessment using natural sampler DNA metabarcoding.",

    "abstract": "The chloroplast (plastid) arose via endosymbiosis of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium by a non-photosynthetic eukaryotic cell approximately 1.5 billion years ago. Although the plastid underwent rapid evolution by genome reduction, its rate of molecular evolution is low and its genome organisation is highly conserved. Here, we investigate the factors that have constrained the rate of molecular evolution of protein coding genes in the plastid genome. Through analysis of 773 angiosperm plastid genomes we show that there is substantial variation in the rate of molecular evolution between genes. We show that variation in the strength of purifying selection between genes is a major determinant of variation in the rate of molecular evolution. We further demonstrate that the distance of a gene from the likely origin of replication influences the rate at which it has evolved, consistent with time and distance dependent mutation gradients. In addition, we show that the amino acid composition of a gene product constraints its substitution tolerance, limiting its rate of molecular evolution. Finally, we demonstrate that the mRNA abundance of a gene is a key factor in determining its rate of molecular evolution, suggesting an interaction between transcription and DNA repair in the plastid. Collectively, we show that the location, composition, and expression of a plastid gene can account for [&ge;]32% of the variation in its rate of molecular evolution. Thus, these three factors have exerted a substantial limitation on the capacity for adaptive evolution of plastid genes, and constrained the evolvability of the chloroplast.",

    "abstract": "The spatial architecture of the tumour microenvironment and phenotypic heterogeneity of tumour cells have been shown to be associated with cancer prognosis and clinical outcomes, including survival. Recent advances in highly multiplexed imaging, including imaging mass cytometry (IMC), capture spatially resolved, high-dimensional maps that quantify dozens of disease-relevant biomarkers at single-cell resolution, that contain potential to inform patient-specific prognosis. However, existing automated methods for predicting survival typically do not leverage spatial phenotype information captured at the single-cell level, and current methods tend to focus on a single modality, such as patient variables (PVs). There is no end-to-end method designed to leverage the rich information in whole IMC images and all marker channels, and aggregate this information with PVs in a complementary manner to predict survival with enhanced accuracy. We introduce a deep multimodal graph-based network (DMGN) that integrates entire IMC images and multiple PVs for end-to-end survival prediction of breast cancer. We propose a multimodal graph-based module that considers relationships between spatial phenotype information in all image regions and all PVs, and scales each region-PV pair based on its relevance to survival. We propose another module to automatically generate embeddings specialised for each PV to enhance multimodal aggregation. We show that our modules are consistently effective at improving survival prediction performance using two public datasets, and that DMGN can be applied to an independent validation dataset across the same antigens but different antibody clones. Our DMGN outperformed state-of-the-art methods at survival prediction.",

The local and transient detachment of myo-II from the cell cortex is coupled with the junction shrinkage and elongation via an interplay between the LIM domain-containing protein Jub and the tricellular junction protein M6. Furthermore, we developed a mechanical model based on the wetting theory and clarified the way by which the physical properties of myo-II cables are integrated with the junction geometry to induce the transition between the attached and detached states and support the unidirectionality of cell rearrangement. Collectively, the present study elucidates the orchestration of geometry, mechanics and signaling for exchanging junctions.",

Continuous long-read sequencing of oropharyngeal cancers and cancer cell lines revealed a unique form of structural variation, i.e., heterocateny, characterized by diverse, interrelated, and repetitive patterns of concatemerized virus and host DNA segments within a cancer. Unique breakpoint sequences shared across structural variants facilitated stepwise reconstruction of their evolution from a common molecular ancestor. This analysis revealed that virus and virus-host concatemers are unstable and, upon insertion into and excision from chromosomes, facilitate capture, amplification, and recombination of host DNA and chromosomal rearrangements. Evidence of heterocateny was detected in extrachromosomal and intrachromosomal DNA. The data indicate that heterocateny is driven by the dynamic, aberrant replication and recombination of an oncogenic DNA virus, thereby extending known consequences of HPV integration to include promotion of intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution.",

    "abstract": "Calibrating mathematical models to describe ecological data provides important insight via parameter estimation that is not possible from analysing data alone. When we undertake a mathematical modelling study of ecological or biological data, we must deal with the trade-off between data availability and model complexity. Dealing with the nexus between data availability and model complexity is an ongoing challenge in mathematical modelling, particularly in mathematical biology and mathematical ecology where data collection is often not standardised, and more broad questions about model selection remain relatively open. Therefore, choosing an appropriate model almost always requires case-by-case consideration. In this work we present a straightforward approach to quantitatively explore this trade-off using a case study exploring mathematical models of coral reef regrowth after some ecological disturbance, such as damage caused by a tropical cyclone. In particular, we compare a simple single species ordinary differential equation (ODE) model approach with a more complicated two-species coupled ODE model. Univariate profile likelihood analysis suggests that the both models are practically identifiable. To provide additional insight we construct and compare approximate prediction intervals using a new parameter-wise prediction approximation, confirming both the simple and complex models perform similarly with regard to making predictions. Our approximate parameter-wise prediction interval analysis provides explicit information about how each parameter affects the predictions of each model. Comparing our approximate prediction intervals with a more rigorous and computationally expensive evaluation of the full likelihood shows that the new approximations are reasonable in this case. All algorithms and software to support this work are freely available as jupyter notebooks on GitHub so that they can be adapted to deal with any other ODE-based models.",

    "abstract": "Continuous evolution of Omicron has led to a rapid and simultaneous emergence of numerous variants that display growth advantages over BA. 5. Despite their divergent evolutionary courses, mutations on their receptor-binding domain (RBD) converge on several hotspots. The driving force and destination of such convergent evolution and its impact on humoral immunity remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that these convergent mutations can cause striking evasion of neutralizing antibody (NAb) drugs and convalescent plasma, including those from BA.5 breakthrough infection, while maintaining sufficient ACE2 binding capability. BQ.1.1.10, BA.4.6.3, XBB, and CH. 1.1 are the most antibody-evasive strain tested, even exceeding SARS-CoV-1 level. To delineate the origin of the convergent evolution, we determined the escape mutation profiles and neutralization activity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) isolated from BA.2 and BA.5 breakthrough-infection convalescents. Importantly, due to humoral immune imprinting, BA.2 and especially BA.5 breakthrough infection caused significant reductions in the epitope diversity of NAbs and increased proportion of non-neutralizing mAbs, which in turn concentrated humoral immune pressure and promoted convergent evolution. Moreover, we showed that the convergent RBD mutations could be accurately inferred by integrated deep mutational scanning (DMS) profiles, and the evolution trends of BA.2.75/BA.5 subvariants could be well-simulated through constructed convergent pseudovirus mutants. Together, our results suggest current herd immunity and BA.5 vaccine boosters may not provide good protection against infection. Broad-spectrum SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and NAb drugs development should be highly prioritized, and the constructed mutants could help to examine their effectiveness in advance.",

    "abstract": "Primary sensory axons stop regenerating as they re-enter the spinal cord, resulting in incurable sensory loss. What arrests them has remained unclear. We previously showed that axons stop by forming synaptic contacts with unknown non-neuronal cells. Here, we identified these cells in adult mice as oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). We also found that only a few axons stop regenerating by forming dystrophic endings, exclusively at the CNS:PNS borderline where OPCs are absent. Most axons stop in contacts with a dense network of OPC processes. Live imaging, immuno-EM and OPC-DRG co-culture additionally suggest that axons are rapidly immobilized by forming synapses with OPCs. Genetic OPC ablation enables many axons to continue regenerating deep into the spinal cord. We propose that sensory axons stop regenerating by encountering OPCs that induce presynaptic differentiation. Our findings identify OPCs as a major regenerative barrier that prevents intraspinal restoration of sensory circuits following spinal root injury.",

    "abstract": "Effective suppression of transposable elements (TEs) is paramount to maintain genomic integrity and organismal fitness. In D. melanogaster, flamenco is a master suppressor of TEs, preventing their movement from somatic ovarian support cells to the germline. It is transcribed by Pol II as a long (100s of kb), single-stranded, primary transcript, that is metabolized into Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) that target active TEs via antisense complementarity. flamenco is thought to operate as a trap, owing to its high content of recent horizontally transferred TEs that are enriched in antisense orientation. Using newly-generated long read genome data, which is critical for accurate assembly of repetitive sequences, we find that flamenco has undergone radical transformations in sequence content and even copy number across simulans clade Drosophilid species. D. simulans flamenco has duplicated and diverged, and neither copy exhibits synteny with D. melanogaster beyond the core promoter. Moreover, flamenco organization is highly variable across D. simulans individuals. Next, we find that D. simulans and D. mauritiana flamenco display signatures of a dual-stranded cluster, with ping-pong signals in the testis and/or embryo. This is accompanied by increased copy numbers of germline TEs, consistent with these regions operating as functional dual stranded clusters. Overall, the physical and functional diversity of flamenco orthologs is testament to the extremely dynamic consequences of TE arms races on genome organization, not only amongst highly related species, but even amongst individuals.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila germline, Me31B is a putative ATP-dependent, RNA helicase that plays role in post-transcriptional RNA regulation to ensure the correct spatial and temporal expression of the mRNAs, a process crucial for proper germline development and fertility. However, Me31Bs in vivo working mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we aim to analyze the functions of Me31Bs key domains/motifs to understand how these domains/motifs operate to fulfill the proteins overall activities. We generated Drosophila strains mutant for six important motifs including three ATPase/helicase motifs (DEAD-box, DVLARAK, and HRIGR), the N-terminal domain (N-ter), the C-terminal domain (C-ter), and a protein-binding motif (FDF motif-binding motif). In characterizing these mutants, we observed that the three ATPase/helicase motif mutations cause dominant female sterility which is associated with developmental defects in oogenesis and embryogenesis. Follow-up examination of the DVLARAK motif mutant revealed its abnormalities in germline mRNA localization and transcript level. The Me31B N-ter domain (deletion of C-ter), C-ter domain (deletion of N-ter), and mutation of FDF motif-binding motif led to a decrease in female fertility and abnormal subcellular Me31B localizations in the egg chambers. Moreover, deletion of Me31B N-ter or C-ter motif results in a decrease of Me31B protein levels in the ovaries. This study indicates that these six motifs of Me31B play different roles to contribute to Me31Bs whole-protein functions like ATPase, RNA helicase, protein stability, protein localization, and partner protein binding, which are crucial for germline development and fertility. Considering Me31B protein familys conserved presence in both Drosophila germline and soma (for example, neurons) and in other organisms such as yeast, worm, mouse, and human, the results from this study could expand our understanding of Me31B helicase familys general working mechanisms in different cell types and species.",

    "abstract": "The current rapid extinction of species leads not only to their loss but also the disappearance of the unique features they harbour, which have evolved along the branches of the underlying evolutionary tree. One proxy for estimating the feature diversity (FD) of a set S of species at the tips of a tree is  phylogenetic diversity (PD): the sum of the branch lengths of the subtree connecting the species in S. For a phylogenetic tree that evolves under a standard birth-death process, and which is then subject to a sudden extinction event at the present (the simple  field of bullets model with a survival probability of s per species) the proportion of the original PD that is retained after extinction at the present is known to converge quickly to a particular concave function{varphi} PD(s) as t grows. To investigate how the loss of FD mirrors the loss of PD for a birth-death tree, we model FD by assuming that distinct discrete features arise randomly and independently along the branches of the tree at rate r and are lost at a constant rate v. We derive an exact mathematical expression for the ratio{varphi} FD(s) of the two expected feature diversities (prior to and following an extinction event at the present) as t becomes large. We find that although{varphi} FD has a similar behaviour to{varphi} PD (and coincides with it for v = 0), when v > 0,{varphi} FD(s) is described by a function that is different from{varphi} PD(s). We also derive an exact expression for the expected number of features that are present in precisely one extant species. Our paper begins by establishing some generic properties of FD in a more general (non-phylogenetic) setting and applies this to fixed trees, before considering the setting of random (birth-death) trees.",

    "abstract": "MotivationIn metabolic engineering and synthetic biology applications, promoters with appropriate strengths are critical. However, it is time-consuming and laborious to annotate promoter strength by experiments. Nowadays many machine learning (ML) methods are applied to synthetic promoter strength prediction, but existing models are limited by the excessive proximity between synthetic promoters.\n\nResultsIn order to enhance ML models to better predict the synthetic promoter strength, we propose EVMP(Extended Vision Mutant Priority), a universal framework which utilize mutation information more effectively. In EVMP, synthetic promoters are equivalently transformed into base promoter and corresponding k-mer mutations, which are input into BaseEncoder and VarEncoder respectively. In Trc synthetic promoter library, EVMP was applied to multiple ML models and the model effect was enhanced to varying extents, up to 61.30%, while the SOTA(state-of-the-art) record was improved by 15.25%. EVMP also provides optional data augmentation based on multiple base promoters, which further improved the model performance by 17.95% compared with non-EVMP SOTA record. In further study, extended vision is shown to be essential for EVMP. We also found that EVMP can alleviate the over-smoothing phenomenon, which may contributes to its effectiveness. Our work suggests that EVMP can highlight the mutation information of synthetic promoters and significantly improve the prediction accuracy of strength.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe source code is publicly available on github: https://github.com/Tiny-Snow/EVMP.\n\nContacthuangrr@sdu.edu.cn\n\nSupplementary informationAppendix is available at bioRxiv online.",

We show the importance of cellular glycosaminoglycans and glycosphingolipids for HSV-1 attachment, N-glycans for entry and spread, and O-glycans for propagation. While altered virion surface structures had minimal effects on the early interactions with wild type cells, mutation of specific O-glycosylation sites affected glycoprotein surface expression and function. In conclusion, the data demonstrates the importance of specific glycans in a clinically relevant human model of HSV-1 infection and highlights the utility of genetic engineering to elucidate the roles of specific viral and cellular carbohydrate structures.",

    "abstract": "Sequence-to-graph alignment is an important step in applications such as variant genotyping, read error correction and genome assembly. When a query sequence requires a substantial number of edits to align, approximate alignment tools that follow the seed-and-extend approach require shorter seeds to get any matches. However, in large graphs with high variation, relying on a shorter seed length leads to an exponential increase in spurious matches. We propose a novel seeding approach relying on long inexact matches instead of short exact matches. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach achieves a better time-accuracy trade-off in settings with up to a 25% mutation rate.\n\nWe achieve this by sketching a subset of graph nodes and storing them in a K-nearest neighbor index. While sketches are more robust to indels, finding the nearest neighbor of a sketch in a high-dimensional space is more computationally challenging than finding exact seeds. We demonstrate that if we store sketch vectors in a K-nearest neighbor index, we can circumvent the curse of dimensionality. Our long sketch-based seed scheme contrasts existing approaches and highlights the important role that tensor sketching can play in bioinformatics applications. Our proposed seeding method and implementation have several advantages: i) We empirically show that our method is efficient and scales to graphs with 1 billion nodes, with time and memory requirements for preprocessing growing linearly with graph size and query time growing quasi-logarithmically with query length. ii) For queries with an edit distance of 25% relative to their length, on the 1 billion node graph, longer sketch-based seeds yield a 4x increase in recall compared to exact seeds. iii) Conceptually, our seeder can be incorporated into other aligners, proposing a novel direction for sequence-to-graph alignment.\n\nThe implementation is available at: https://github.com/ratschlab/tensor-sketch-alignment.",

However, the applications of NHPs in AD research have been hindered by the paucity of spontaneous or induced monkey models for AD due to their long generation time, ethical considerations and technical challenges in making genetically modified monkeys. Here we developed an AD-like NHP model by overexpressing human tau in bilateral hippocampi of adult rhesus macaque monkeys. We evaluated the pathological features of these monkeys with immunostaining, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) scan, and behavioral tests. We demonstrated that after hippocampal overexpression of human tau, the rhesus macaque monkeys displayed multiple pathological features of AD, including neurofibrillary tangle formation, neuronal loss, hippocampal atrophy, neuroinflammation, A{beta} clearance deficit, blood vessel damage and cognitive decline.

    "abstract": "Microbial plankton play a central role in marine biogeochemical cycles, but the timing in which abundant lineages diversified into ocean environments remains unclear. Here, we reconstructed the timeline in which major clades of bacteria and archaea colonized the ocean using a high-resolution benchmarked phylogenetic tree that allows for simultaneous and direct comparison of the ages of multiple divergent lineages. Our findings show that the diversification of the most prevalent marine clades spans throughout a period of 2.2 Ga, with most clades colonizing the ocean during the last 800 million years. The oldest clades - SAR202, SAR324, Ca. Marinimicrobia, and Marine Group II - diversified around the time of the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), during which oxygen concentration increased but remained at microaerophilic levels throughout the Mid-Proterozoic, consistent with the prevalence of some clades within these groups in oxygen minimum zones today. We found the diversification of the prevalent heterotrophic marine clades SAR11, SAR116, SAR92, SAR86, and Roseobacter as well as the Marine Group I, to occur near to the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (0.8-0.4 Ga). The diversification of these clades is concomitant with an overall increase of oxygen and nutrients in the ocean at this time, as well as the diversification of eukaryotic algae, consistent with the previous hypothesis that the diversification of heterotrophic bacteria is linked to the emergence of large eukaryotic phytoplankton. The youngest clades correspond to the widespread phototrophic clades Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and Crocosphaera, whose diversification happened after the Phanerozoic Oxidation Event (0.45-0.4 Ga), in which oxygen concentrations had already reached their modern levels in the atmosphere and the ocean. Our work clarifies the timing at which abundant lineages of bacteria and archaea colonized the ocean, thereby providing key insights into the evolutionary history of lineages that comprise the majority of prokaryotic biomass in the modern ocean.",

    "abstract": "The brains of black 6 mice (Mus musculus) and Sebas short-tailed bats (Carollia perspicillata) weigh roughly the same and share mammalian neocortical laminar architecture. Bats have highly developed sonar calls and social communication and are an excellent neuroethological animal model for auditory research. Mice are olfactory and somatosensory specialists, used frequently in auditory neuroscience for their advantage of standardization and wide genetic toolkit. This study presents an analytical approach to overcome the challenge of inter-species comparison with existing data. In both data sets, we recorded with linear multichannel electrodes down the depth of the primary auditory cortex (A1) while presenting repetitive stimuli trains at ~5 and ~40 Hz to awake bats and mice. We found that while there are similarities between cortical response profiles in both, there was a better signal to noise ratio in bats under these conditions, which allowed for a clearer following response to stimuli trains. Model fit analysis supported this, illustrating that bats had stronger response amplitude suppression to consecutive stimuli. Additionally, continuous wavelet transform revealed that bats had significantly stronger power and phase coherence during stimulus response and mice had stronger power in the background. Better signal to noise ratio and lower intertrial phase variability in bats could represent specialization for faster and more accurate temporal processing at lower metabolic costs. Our findings demonstrate a potentially different general auditory processing principle; investigating such differences may increase our understanding of how the ecological need of a species shapes the development and function of its nervous system.",

Thus, we took advantage of a cold-blooded teleost fish that offered natural kinetics for the induction and regulation of fever and a broad range of tolerated temperatures. A custom swim chamber, coupled to high-fidelity quantitative positional tracking, showed remarkable consistency in fish behaviours and defined the febrile window. Animals exerting fever engaged pyrogenic cytokine gene programs in the CNS, increased efficiency of leukocyte recruitment into the immune challenge site, and markedly improved pathogen clearance in vivo, even when an infecting bacterium grew better at higher temperatures. Contrary to earlier speculations for global upregulation of immunity, we identified selectivity in the protective immune mechanisms activated through fever. Fever then inhibited inflammation and markedly improved wound repair. Artificial mechanical hyperthermia, often used as a model of fever, recapitulated some but not all benefits achieved through natural host-driven dynamic thermoregulation. Together, our results define fever as an integrative host response that regulates induction and resolution of acute inflammation, and demonstrate that this integrative strategy emerged prior to endothermy during evolution.",

    "abstract": "The Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle (CBBC) performs carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. Among the eleven enzymes that participate in the pathway, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (SBPase) is expressed in photo-autotrophs and contributes to the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, the carbon fixation co-substrate used by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). While SBPase is structurally similar to fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) involved in both neoglucogenesis and the CBBC, it exclusively functions in the CBBC and is indispensable for building a productive cycle. In this study we report the first structure of an SBPase from a chlorophyte, the model unicellular green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. By combining experimental and computational structural analyses, we describe the topology, conformations and quaternary structure of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii SBPase. We identify active site residues and locate sites of redox- and phospho-post-translational modifications that contribute to enzymatic functions. Finally, we observe that CrSBPase adopts distinct oligomeric states that may dynamically contribute to the control of its activity.",

    "abstract": "Tumor suppressor p53 and its related proteins, p63 and p73, can be synthesized as multiple isoforms lacking part of the N- or C-terminal regions. Specifically, high expression of the {Delta}Np73 isoform is notoriously associated with various human malignancies characterized by poor prognosis. This isoform is also accumulated by oncogenic viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), as well as genus beta human papillomaviruses (HPV) that appear to be involved in carcinogenesis. To gain additional insight into {Delta}Np73 mechanisms, we have performed proteomics analyses using human keratinocytes transformed by the E6 and E7 proteins of the beta-HPV type 38 virus as an experimental model (38HK). We find that {Delta}Np73 associates with the E2F4/p130 repressor complex through a direct interaction with E2F4. This interaction is favored by the N-terminal truncation of p73 characteristic of {Delta}Np73 isoforms. Moreover, it is independent of the C-terminal splicing status, suggesting that it could represent a general feature of {Delta}Np73 isoforms (, {beta}, {gamma}, {delta}, {varepsilon}, {zeta}, {theta}, {eta}, and {eta}1). We also show that the {Delta}Np73- E2F4/p130 complex inhibits the expression of specific genes, including genes encoding for negative regulators of proliferation, both in 38HK and in HPV-negative cancer-derived cell lines. Consistently, silencing of E2F4 in 38HK and in cancer cells results in induction of senescence. In conclusion, we have identified and characterized a novel transcriptional regulatory complex that exerts pro-survival functions in transformed cells.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe TP53 gene is mutated in about 50% of human cancers. In contrast, the TP63 and TP73 genes are rarely mutated but rather expressed as {Delta}Np63 and {Delta}Np73 isoforms in a wide range of malignancies, where they act as p53 antagonists. Accumulation of {Delta}Np63 and {Delta}Np73, which is associated with chemoresistance, can result from infection by oncogenic viruses such as EBV or HPV. Our study focuses on the highly carcinogenic {Delta}Np73 isoform and uses a viral model of cellular transformation. We unveil a physical interaction between {Delta}Np73 and the E2F4/p130 complex involved in cell cycle control, which rewires the E2F4/p130 transcriptional program. Consistently, we find that E2F4 gains pro-survival functions in transformed cells expressing {Delta}Np73. This report shows, for the first time, that {Delta}Np73 isoforms acquire novel protein-protein interactions with respect to the TAp73 tumor suppressor. This situation is analogous to the gain-of-function interactions of p53 mutants supporting cellular proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria form diverse communities and are important primary producers in Antarctic freshwater environments, but their geographic distribution patterns in Antarctica and globally are still unresolved. There are however few genomes of cultured cyanobacteria from Antarctica available and therefore metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from Antarctic cyanobacteria microbial mats provide an opportunity to explore distribution of uncultured taxa. These MAGs also allow comparison with metagenomes of cyanobacteria enriched communities from a range of habitats, geographic locations, and climates. However, most MAGs do not contain 16S rRNA gene sequences, making a 16S rRNA gene-based biogeography comparison difficult. An alternative technique is to use large-scale k-mer searching to find genomes of interest in public metagenomes.\n\nThis paper presents the results of k-mer based searches for 5 Antarctic cyanobacteria MAGs from Lakes Fryxell and Lake Vanda, assigned the names Phormidium pseudopriestleyi, a Microcoleus, a Leptolyngbya, a Pseudanabaena, and a Neosynechococcus (Lumian et al., 2021, Lumian et al., 2022, in prep.) in 498,942 unassembled metagenomes from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Sequence Read Archive (SRA). The Microcoleus MAG was found in a wide variety of environments, P. pseudopriestleyi was found in environments with challenging conditions, the Neosynechococcus was only found in Antarctica, and the Leptolyngbya and Pseudanabaena MAGs were found in Antarctic and other cold environments. The findings based on metagenome matches and global comparisons suggest that these Antarctic cyanobacteria have distinct distribution patterns ranging from locally restricted to global distribution across the cold biosphere and other climatic zones.",

During development in the sand fly vector, the eukaryotic parasite Leishmania adheres to the stomodeal valve, as the specialised haptomonad form. Dissection of haptomonad adhesion is a critical step for understanding parasite transmission. Nevertheless, haptomonad studies are limited, as this is a technically challenging life cycle form to investigate. Here, we have combined three-dimensional electron microscopy approaches, including serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBFSEM) and serial tomography to dissect the organisation and architecture of haptomonads in the sand fly. We showed that the attachment plaque contains distinct structural elements. Using time-lapse light microscopy, we identified five stages of haptomonad differentiation, and showed that calcium is necessary for haptomonad adhesion to the surface. This study provides the structural and regulatory foundations of the haptomonad form, which are critical for a holistic understanding of Leishmania transmission.",

    "abstract": "Malonyl-CoA is a key metabolic intermediate for biosynthesis of diverse cellular molecules and natural products. Carboxylation of acetyl-CoA is almost the unique pathway for malonly-CoA biosynthesis. Biotechnological production of numerous value-added malonyl-CoA-derived chemicals require high intracellular supply of malonyl-CoA. However, because of the central role of acetyl-CoA in primary metabolism, it is difficult to develop flexible strategies to balance malonyl-CoA supply with other cellular metabolism. Here we find that there is a natural alternative malonyl-CoA-producing pathway, in which the key reaction is catalyzed by an -keto acid dehydrogenase complex BkdFGH from Streptomyces avermitilis. This dehydrogenase complex could efficiently catalyze biosynthesis of malonyl-CoA from oxaloacetate in addition to recognizing its native substrate branched-chain -keto acid. Oxaloacetate dehydrogenase (OADH) was shown to play important physiological roles during the regulation of biosynthesis of native malonyl-CoA-derived polyketides in Streptomyces. Furthermore, the oxlaocetate dehydrogenation reaction is thermodynamically superior to acetyl-CoA carboxylation and enable efficient bioproduction of diverse malonyl-CoA-derived chemicals in engineering Escherichia coli. This novel malonyl-CoA source thus has great potential in the biotechnological field.",

    "abstract": "Subverting the host immune system is a major task for any given pathogen to assure its survival and proliferation. For the opportunistic human pathogen Bacillus cereus (Bc), immune evasion enables the establishment of potent infections. In various species of the Bc group, the pleiotropic regulator PlcR and its cognate cell-cell signaling peptide PapR7 regulates virulence genes expression in response to fluctuations in population density, i.e., a quorum-sensing (QS) system. However, how QS exerts its effects during infections, and whether PlcR confers the immune evading ability remain unclear. Herein, we report how interception of the QS communication in Bc obliterates the ability to control the host immune system. Here we designed a peptide-based QS inhibitor that suppresses PlcR-dependent virulence factor expression and attenuates Bc infectivity in mouse models. We demonstrate that the QS peptidic inhibitor blocks host immune system-mediated eradication by reducing the expression of PlcR-regulated major toxins. Our findings provide the first evidence that Bc infectivity is regulated by QS circuit mediated destruction of the host immunity, thus reveal a new strategy to limit Bc virulence and enhance host defense. This peptidic quorum-quenching agent constitutes readily accessible chemical tool for studying how other pathogen QS systems modulate host immunity and forms a basis for development of anti-infective therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "When microbes grow in foreign nutritional environments, selection may enrich mutations in unexpected pathways connecting growth and homeostasis. An evolution experiment designed to identify beneficial mutations in Burkholderia cenocepacia captured six independent nonsynonymous substitutions in the essential gene tilS, which modifies tRNAIle2 by adding a lysine to the anticodon for faithful AUA recognition. Further, five additional mutants acquired mutations in tRNAIle2, which strongly suggests that disrupting the TilS:tRNAIle2 interaction was subject to strong positive selection. Mutated TilS incurred greatly reduced enzymatic function but retained capacity for tRNAIle2 binding. Yet both mutant sets outcompeted wild-type by decreasing lag phase duration by [~]3.5 hours. We hypothesized that lysine demand could underlie fitness in the experimental conditions. As predicted, supplemental lysine complemented the ancestral fitness deficit, but so did additions of several other amino acids. Mutant fitness advantages were also specific to rapid growth on galactose using oxidative overflow metabolism that generates redox imbalance, not resources favoring more balanced metabolism. Remarkably, 13 tilS mutations also evolved in the Long-Term Evolution Experiment with E. coli, including four fixed mutations. These results suggest that TilS or unknown binding partners contribute to improved growth under conditions of rapid sugar oxidation at the predicted expense of translational accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Adherent-invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) strains are frequently recovered from stools of patients with dysbiotic microbiota. They have remarkable properties of adherence to the intestinal epithelium, and survive better than other E. coli in macrophages. The best studied of these AIEC is probably strain LF82, which was isolated from a Crohns disease patient. This strain contains five complete prophages, which have not been studied until now. We undertook their analysis, both in vitro and inside macrophages, and show that all of them form virions. The Gally prophage is by far the most active, generating spontaneously over 108 viral particles per mL of culture supernatants in vitro, more than 100-fold higher than the other phages. Gally is over-induced after a genotoxic stress generated by ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim. However, upon macrophage infection, Gally virion production is decreased by more than 20-fold, and the transcription profile of the prophage indicates that part of the structural module is specifically repressed while the replication module is overexpressed compared to unstressed culture conditions. We conclude that strain LF82 has evolved an efficient way to \"tame\" its most active prophage upon macrophage infection, which may participate to its good survival in macrophages. The results are discussed in light of the active lysogeny process.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYProphages are bacterial viruses stably integrated into their host, to which they can provide new functions, thus increasing their fitness in the environment. Thereby, they can participate to the virulence of bacterial pathogens. However, prophages are double-edged swords that can be awakened in response to genotoxic stresses, resulting in the death of their bacterial host. This raises the question of the effect of this type of stress in the natural environments where their bacterial hosts exert their virulence. In this study, we characterized the five active prophages present in Escherichia coli LF82, a strain belonging to the intestinal microbiota and suspected to be involved in Crohns disease via its ability to invade macrophages, a highly genotoxic environment. We show that LF82 inhibits the awakening of its prophages in macrophages, allowing it to survive there. Moreover, deletion of its most active prophage does not affect the viability of LF82 in this environment. These results show that LF82 has tamed its prophages in macrophages and also suggest that if they convey fitness advantages, they probably do so in environments differing from macrophages, and which remain to be discovered.",

Identification of new proteins involved in these processes is essential to understand how cancer cells tolerate DNA lesions. Here we show that human GNL3/nucleostemin, a GTP-binding protein localized mostly in the nucleolus and highly expressed in cancer cells, prevents nuclease-dependent resection of nascent DNA in response to exogenous replication stress. We demonstrate that inhibition of origin firing decreases this resection, indicating that the increased replication origin firing seen upon GNL3 depletion mainly accounts for the observed DNA resection. We show that GNL3 and DNA replication initiation factor ORC2 interact in the nucleolus and that the concentration of GNL3 in the nucleolus is required to limit DNA resection in response to replicative stress. We propose that the accurate control of origin firing by GNL3, possibly through the regulation of ORC2 sub-nuclear localization, is critical to prevent nascent DNA resection in response to replication stress.",

    "abstract": "Single-domain antibodies (sdAbs, VHHs, or nanobodies) are a promising tool for the treatment of both infectious and somatic diseases. Their small size greatly simplifies any genetic engineering manipulations. Such antibodies have the ability to bind hard-to-reach antigenic epitopes through long parts of the variable chains, the third complementarity-determining regions (CDR3s). VHH fusion with the canonical immunoglobulin Fc fragment allows the Fc-fusion single-domain antibodies (VHH-Fc) to significantly increase their neutralizing activity and serum half-life. Previously we have developed and characterized VHH-Fc specific to botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A), that showed a 1000-fold higher protective activity than monomeric form when challenged with five times the lethal dose (5 LD50) of BoNT/A. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA vaccines based on lipid nanoparticles (LNP) as a delivery system have become an important translational technology that has significantly accelerated the clinical introduction of mRNA platforms. We have developed an mRNA platform that provides long-term expression after both intramuscular and intravenous application. The platform has been extensively characterized using firefly luciferase (Fluc) as a reporter. An intramuscular administration of LNP-mRNA encoding VHH-Fc antibody made it possible to achieve its rapid expression in mice and resulted in 100% protection when challenged with up to 100 LD50 of BoNT/A. The presented approach for the delivery of sdAbs using mRNA technology greatly simplifies drug development for antibody therapy and can be used for emergency prophylaxis.",

    "abstract": "The fitness of animal hybrids follows two empirical rules: hybrids of the heterogametic sex aremore unfit (Haldanes Rule), and the sex chromosome is disproportionately involved in incompatibility (the large-X/Z effect). Whether these rules result from genetic mechanisms shared across taxa remains unknown, and existing explanations rarely consider female heterogametic taxa such as butterflies. Here, we investigate hybrid incompatibilities in Papilio and Heliconius butterflies, and show that defects coincide with unbalanced introgression between the Z chromosome and its genetic background. This polygenic mechanism predicts both rules because introgressed ancestry on the Z chromosome is more skewed in females, and is more variable than on all autosomes. Therefore, the explanation for both rules in butterflies shares little similarity with prevailing theories relying on dominance.",

    "abstract": "Coprinopsis cinerea is a model mushroom for studying the developmental processes of homobasidiomycetous fungi. The development of C. cinerea depends on the sensing of environmental conditions, such as light, temperature, humidity and nutrients. The signal transduction pathway from the environmental condition sensors to the regulators and reproduction is an important research topic as the knowledge on it is still fragmentary. Protein kinases not only are crucial to the signal transduction, but also can be master switches of development. However, information on their role in basidiomycetous fungi is still limited. Using the effective gene-targeting of the current gene modification, a system of CRISPR/ Cas9 RNP with double strain template donor that contained a selective mark hygromycin cassette was developed in this study. In this system, CcPka1 gene knockout was successfully generated through homologues repair together with Cas9 RNP complexes. This was the first report to use CRISPR/ Cas9 RNP approach with C. cinerea. {Delta}CcPka1 mutants showed slow mycelial growth and rapid fruiting body induction compared to the wild type even when under high glucose condition. In addition, {Delta}CcPka1 mutants had significantly increased intracellular glucose level and decreased glycogen level. Moreover, {Delta}CcPka1 mutants regulated the gene expression of components in cAMP-PKA pathway. All these results demonstrated that PKA played an important role in the nutrient signal transduction and negatively regulated the fruiting body formation. This study also confirmed that GSK3 could be the downstream target of PKA, but their interaction requires further investigation.",

This modification is introduced by the TrmB enzyme, which is conserved in bacteria and eukaryotes. Complementing the report of various phenotypes for different organisms lacking TrmB homologs, we report here hydrogen peroxide sensitivity for the Escherichia coli {Delta}trmB knockout strain. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of tRNA binding by E. coli TrmB in real-time, we developed a new assay based on introducing a 4-thiouridine modification at position 8 of in vitro transcribed tRNAPhe enabling us to fluorescently labelled this unmodified tRNA. Using rapid kinetic stopped-flow measurements with this fluorescent tRNA, we examined the interaction of wild-type and single substitution variants of TrmB with tRNA. Our results reveal the role of SAM for rapid and stable tRNA binding, the rate-limiting nature of m7G46 catalysis for tRNA release, and the importance of residues R26, T127 and R155 across the entire surface of TrmB for tRNA binding.",

    "abstract": "Motile bacteria have a chemotaxis system that enables them to sense their environment and direct their swimming towards favorable conditions. Chemotaxis involves a signaling process in which ligand binding to the extracellular domain of the chemoreceptor alters the activity of the histidine kinase, CheA, bound [~]300 [A] away to the distal cytoplasmic tip of the receptor, to initiate a phosphorylation cascade that controls flagellar rotation. The cytoplasmic domain of the receptor is thought to propagate this signal via changes in dynamics and/or stability, but it is unclear how these changes modulate the kinase activity of CheA. To address this question, we have used hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry to probe the structure and dynamics of CheA within functional signaling complexes of the E. coli aspartate receptor cytoplasmic fragment, CheA, and CheW. Our results reveal that stabilization of the P4 catalytic domain of CheA correlates with kinase activation. Furthermore, differences in activation of the kinase that occur during sensory adaptation depend on receptor destabilization of the P3 dimerization domain of CheA. Finally, hydrogen exchange properties of the P1 domain that bears the phosphorylated histidine identify the dimer interface of P1/P1 in the CheA dimer and support an ordered sequential binding mechanism of catalysis, in which dimeric P1/P1 has productive interactions with P4 only upon nucleotide binding. Thus stabilization/destabilization of domains is a key element of the mechanism of modulating CheA kinase activity in chemotaxis, and may play a role in the control of other kinases.",

    "abstract": "Although human oral fluid has become more routine for quantitative drug detection in pain management, detecting a large scope of medications and substances is costly and technically challenging for laboratories. This paper presents a quantitative assay for 64 pain medications, illicit substances, and drug metabolites in human oral fluid. The novelty of this assay is that it was developed on an older model AB SCIEX 4000 instrument and renders obscure the need for more technical and expensive laboratory equipment. This method includes addition of internal standard and a 2-step liquid-liquid extraction and dry-down step to concentrate and clean the samples. The samples were suspended in 50% MeOH in water and separation and detection was accomplished using triple quadrupole mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Separation was achieved using reverse-phase liquid chromatography with detection by LC-MS/MS. A second injection was done in negative mode to determine THC-COOH concentration as an indicator of THC. An aliquot of the (already) extracted samples was analyzed for D- and L- isomers of amphetamine and methamphetamine using a chiral column. The standard curve spanned from 5 to 2000 ng/mL for most of the analytes (1 to 2000 ng/mL for fentanyl and THC-COOH) and up to 1000 ng/mL for 13 analytes. Pregabalin and gabapentin ranged from 25 to 2000 ng/mL. The result is a low-cost method for the sensitive detection of a wide-ranging oral fluid menu for pain management. This assay has a high sensitivity, and good precision and accuracy for all analytes with an older model mass spectrometer.",

While the function of many GPCRs has been delineated previously, a significant number require further characterization to elucidate their cellular function. G-protein coupled receptor 19 (GPR19) is a poorly characterized class A GPCR which has been implicated in the regulation of circadian rhythm, tumor metastasis, and mitochondrial homeostasis. In this report, we use a novel knockout (KO) mouse model to examine the role of GPR19 in whole-body metabolic regulation. We show that loss of GPR19 promotes increased energy expenditure and decreased activity in both male and female mice. However, only male GPR19 KO mice display glucose intolerance in response to a high fat diet (HFD). Loss of GPR19 expression in male mice, but not female mice, resulted in diet-induced hepatomegaly, which was associated with decreased expression of key fatty acid oxidation genes in male GPR19 KO livers. Overall, our data suggest that loss of GPR19 impacts whole-body energy metabolism in diet-induced obese mice in a sex-dependent manner.",

ML-guided directed evolution (MLDE) builds on the success of traditional directed evolution and unlocks strategies which make more efficient use of experimental data. Building an MLDE pipeline involves many design choices across the design-build-test-learn loop ranging from data collection strategies to modeling, each of which has a large impact on the success of designed sequences. The cost of collecting experimental data makes benchmarking every component of these pipelines on real data prohibitively difficult, necessitating the development of synthetic landscapes where MLDE strategies can be tested. In this work, we develop a framework called SLIP (\"Synthetic Landscape Inference for Proteins\") for constructing biologically-motivated synthetic landscapes with tunable difficulty based on Potts models. This framework can be extended to any protein family for which there is a sequence alignment. We show that without tuning, Potts models are easy to optimize. In contrast, our tuning framework provides landscapes sufficiently challenging to benchmark MLDE pipelines. SLIP is open-source and is available at https://github.com/google-research/slip.",

    "abstract": "Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the innate immune system detect conserved bacterial molecules, termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are considered the only PRRs that can detect all bacteria, regardless of virulence potential. These PRRs survey PAMPs in the extracellular and phagosomal space, where most bacteria are found. Other PRR families mostly consist of proteins that are localized to the cytosol of immune cells. Due to the membranous barrier of phagosomes, cytosolic PRRs should be restricted from accessing extracellular or phagosomal bacteria and are generally considered to detect pathogens that use virulence factors to disrupt membranes. Despite this rationale, disparate reports suggest that some non-pathogenic, phagosomal bacteria stimulate cytosolic PRRs. In this work, we tested the null hypothesis that TLRs are the only PRRs that commonly detect bacteria. We found that diverse bacteria, regardless of their pathogenicity, stimulated type I interferon (IFN-I) responses in macrophages. While optimal IFN-I responses to Gram-negative bacteria required TLRs, all bacteria stimulated IFN-I through the cytosolic PRR STING. Synthetic biology-based engineering of bacteria to produce distinct STING stimulatory cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs) revealed that CDN abundance within phagosomes is a key determinant of IFN-I induction by macrophages. The STING pathway therefore joins the TLRs as a common driver of innate immune responses to bacterial encounters.",

In vivo tests in mouse infection models were used to investigate the mechanisms of respiratory epithelial barrier dysfunction during respiratory bacterial infection with these pathogens. Results revealed that P. multocida infection significantly increased epithelial permeability and increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in murine tracheae and lungs. In murine lung epithelial cell (MLE-12) models, P. multocida infection decreased the expression of tight junctions (ZO-1) and adherens junctions ({beta}-catenin, E-cadherin), but induced the activation of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) and VEGFA signaling. When expression of HIF-1 is suppressed, the induction of VEGFA and ZO-1expression by P. multocida infection is decreased. We also found that intervention of HIF-1 and VEGFA signaling affected infection outcomes caused by respiratory bacteria in mouse models.

    "abstract": "Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) associated with the use of indwelling urinary catheters. Previous reports have revealed host and pathogen effectors critical for MRSA uropathogenesis. Here, we sought to determine the significance of specific metabolic pathways during MRSA UTI. First, we identified 16 mutants from the Nebraska transposon mutant library in the MRSA JE2 background with significantly reduced growth in pooled human urine (HU). Among these, five genes targeted by transposon mutation also showed significant upregulation upon exposure to HU for 2 h. This prompted us to generate transposon insertion mutants in the uropathogenic MRSA 1369 strain that were defective in TCA cycle ({Delta}sucD, {Delta}fumC), mannitol metabolism ({Delta}mtlD), and pyruvate oxidation and branched chain fatty acid synthesis ({Delta}lpdA). Compared to the WT, the {Delta}lpdA mutant showed a significant defect growth in HU and colonization of the urinary tract and dissemination to spleen in the mouse model of catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI), which may be attributed to its increased membrane hydrophobicity and higher susceptibility to killing in blood. MRSA 1369 {Delta}sucD, {Delta}fumC, and {Delta}mtlD mutants were not defective for in vitro growth in HU but showed significant fitness defects in the CAUTI mouse model. Overall, identification of novel metabolic pathways important for the urinary fitness and survival of MRSA can be used for the development of novel therapeutics.\n\nImportanceWhile Staphylococcus aureus has historically not been considered a uropathogen, S. aureus urinary tract infection (UTI) is clinically significant in certain patient populations, including those with chronic indwelling urinary catheters. Moreover, most S. aureus strains causing catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which is difficult to treat as it limits treatment options and has the potential to deteriorate into life-threatening bacteremia, urosepsis, and shock. In this study, we found that pathways involved in pyruvate oxidation, TCA cycle, and mannitol metabolism are important for MRSA fitness and survival in the urinary tract. Improved understanding of the metabolic needs of MRSA in the urinary tract may help us develop novel inhibitors of MRSA metabolism that can be used to treat MRSA-CAUTI more effectively.",

Agrobacteria, a group of soil-borne phytopathogens causing crown gall disease on various plant species, deploys the T6SS to attack closely- and distantly-related bacterial species in vitro and in planta. Current evidence suggests that the T6SS is not essential for pathogenesis under direct inoculation but it remains unknown whether the T6SS influences natural disease incidence or the microbial community within crown galls (i.e., gallobiome). To address these two key questions, we established a soil inoculation method on wounded tomato seedlings that mimics natural infections and developed a bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicon enrichment sequencing platform. By comparing the Agrobacterium wild-type strain C58 with two T6SS mutants, we demonstrate that the T6SS influences both disease occurrence and gallobiome composition. Based on multiple inoculation trials across seasons, all three strains could induce tumors but the mutants had significantly lower disease incidences. The season of inoculation played a more important role than the T6SS in shaping the gallobiome. The influence of T6SS was evident in summer, in which two Sphingomonas species and the family Burkhoderiaceae were enriched in the gallobiome induced by the mutants. Further in vitro competition and colonization assay demonstrated the T6SS-mediated antagonism to a Sphingomonas sp. R1 strain isolated from tomato rhizosphere in this study. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that the Agrobacterium T6SS promotes tumorigenesis in infection process and provides competitive advantages in gall-associated microbiota.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe T6SS is widespread among Proteobacteria and used for interbacterial competition by agrobacteria, which are soil inhabitants and opportunistic bacterial pathogens causing crown gall disease in a wide range of plants. Current evidence indicates that the T6SS is not required for gall formation when agrobacteria are inoculated directly on plant wounding sites. However, in natural settings, agrobacteria may need to compete with other bacteria in bulk soil to gain access to plant wounds and influence microbial community inside crown galls. The role of the T6SS in these critical aspects of disease ecology have remained largely unknown. In this study, we successfully developed a Soil Inoculation method coupled with Blocker-mediated enrichment of Bacterial 16S rRNA gene Amplicon Sequencing, named as SI-BBacSeq, to address these two important questions. We provided evidence that the T6SS promotes disease occurrence and influences crown gall microbiota composition by interbacterial competition.",

    "abstract": "The trypanosomatid protozoan parasite Leishmania has a significant impact on human health globally. Understanding the pathways associated with virulence within this significant pathogen is critical for identifying novel vaccination and chemotherapy targets. Within this study we leverage an ultradeep proteomic approach to improve our understanding of two virulence associated genes in Leishmania, encoding the Golgi Mannose/Arabinopyranose/Fucose nucleotide-sugar transporter LPG2, and the mitochondrial fucosyltransferase FUT1. Using deep peptide fractionation followed by complementary fragmentation approaches with higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) and Electron-transfer dissociation (ETD) allowed the identification of over 6500 proteins, nearly doubling the experimentally known Leishmania major proteome. This deep proteomic analysis revealed significant quantitative differences in both{Delta} lpg2- and{Delta} fut1s mutants with FUT1-dependent changes linked to marked alterations within mitochondrial associated proteins while LPG2-dependent changes impacted many pathways including the secretory pathway. While the FUT1 enzyme has been shown to fucosylate peptides in vitro, no evidence for protein fucosylation was identified within our ultradeep analysis nor did we observe fucosylated glycans within Leishmania glycopeptides isolated using HILIC enrichment. Combined this work provides a critical resource for the community on the observable Leishmania proteome as well as highlights phenotypic changes associated with LPG2 or FUT1 ablation which may guide the development of future therapeutics.\n\nImportanceLeishmania is a widespread trypanosomatid protozoan parasite of humans with [~]12 million cases ranging from mild to fatal, and hundreds of millions asymptomatically infected. This work advances knowledge of the experimental proteome by nearly 2 fold, to more than 6500 proteins a great resource to investigators seeking to decode how this parasite is transmitted and causes disease, and new targets for therapeutic intervention. The ultradeep proteomics approach identified potential proteins underlying the  persistence without pathology phenotype of deletion mutants of the Golgi nucleotide transporter LPG2, showing many alterations and several candidates. Studies of a rare deletion mutant of the mitochondrial fucosyltransferase FUT1 revealed changes underlying its strong mitochondrial dysfunction, but did not reveal examples of fucosylation of either peptides or N-glycans. This suggests this vital proteins elusive target(s) may be more complex than the methods used could detect, or may not be a protein, perhaps another glycoconjugate or glycolipid.",

Here, we combined depth profiles of oxygen and methane with 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomics, and methane oxidation rates at discrete depths in a stratified coastal marine system (Lake Grevelingen, The Netherlands). Three amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) belonging to different genera of aerobic Methylomonadaceae and the corresponding three methanotrophic metagenome-assembled genomes (MOB-MAGs) were retrieved by 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic analysis respectively. The abundances of the different methanotrophic ASVs and MOB-MAGs peaked at different depths along the methane oxygen counter-gradient and the MOB-MAGs show a quite diverse genomic potential regarding oxygen metabolism, partial denitrification, and sulfur metabolism. Moreover, potential aerobic methane oxidation rates indicated high methanotrophic activity throughout the methane oxygen counter-gradient, even at depths with low in situ methane or oxygen concentration. This suggests that niche-partitioning with high genomic versatility of the present Methylomonadaceae might contribute to the functional resilience of the methanotrophic community and ultimately the efficiency of methane removal in the stratified water column of marine Lake Grevelingen.",

    "abstract": "NusG is a transcription elongation factor that stimulates transcription pausing in Gram+ bacteriaincluding Bacillus subtilis by sequence-specific interaction with a conserved pause-inducing -11TTNTTT-6 motif found in the non-template DNA (ntDNA) strand within the transcription bubble. To reveal the structural basis of NusG-dependent pausing, we determined a cryo-EM structure of a paused transcription complex containing RNAP, NusG, and the TTNTTT motif in the ntDNA strand. Interaction of NusG with the ntDNA strand rearranges the transcription bubble by positioning three consecutive T residues in a cleft between NusG and the {beta}-lobe domain of RNAP. We revealed that the RNAP swivel module rotation (swiveling), which widens (swiveled state) and narrows (non-swiveled state) a cleft between NusG and the {beta}-lobe, is an intrinsic motion of RNAP and is directly linked to nucleotide binding at the active site and to trigger loop folding, an essential conformational change of all cellular RNAPs for the RNA synthesis reaction. We also determined cryo-EM structures of RNAP escaping from a paused transcription complex. These structures revealed the NusG-dependent pausing mechanism by which NusG-ntDNA interaction inhibits the transition from swiveled to non-swiveled states, thereby preventing trigger loop folding and RNA synthesis allosterically. This motion is also reduced by formation of an RNA hairpin within the RNA exit channel. Thus, the pause half-life can be modulated by the strength of the NusG-ntDNA interaction and/or the stability of the RNA hairpin. NusG residues that interact with the TTNTTT motif are widely conserved in bacteria, suggesting that NusG-dependent pausing of transcription is widespread.\n\nSignificance statementTranscription pausing by RNA polymerase (RNAP) regulates gene expression where it controls co-transcriptional RNA folding, synchronizes transcription with translation, and provides time for binding of regulatory factors. Transcription elongation factor NusG stimulates pausing in Gram+ bacteriaincluding Bacillus subtilis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis by sequence-specific interaction with a conserved pause motif found in the non-template DNA (ntDNA) strand within the transcription bubble. Our structural and biochemical results revealed that part of the conserved TTNTTT motif in ntDNA is extruded and sandwiched between NusG and RNAP. Our results further demonstrate that an essential global conformational change in RNAP is directly linked to RNA synthesis, and that the NusG-ntDNA interaction pauses RNA synthesis by interfering with this conformational change.",

    "abstract": "Transcription factors (TFs) activate enhancers to drive cell-specific gene programs in response to signals, but our understanding of enhancer assembly during signaling events is incomplete. Here, we show that Androgen Receptor (AR), a steroid hormone-regulated transcription factor, forms condensates through multivalent interactions in response to androgen signaling to orchestrate enhancer assembly. We demonstrate that the intrinsically disordered N-terminal domain (NTD) of AR drives 1,6-Hexanediol-sensitive condensate formation and that NTD deletion or aromatic residue mutation reduces AR self-association and abolishes AR transcriptional activity. AR NTD can be substituted by intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) from selective proteins for AR condensation capacity and transactivation function. Surprisingly, strengthened AR condensation capacity caused by extending the polyQ tract within AR NTD also leads to impaired transcriptional activity without affecting AR binding on enhancers. Furthermore, either NTD deletion or polyQ extension reduces heterotypic multivalent interactions between AR and other enhancer components. These results suggest the importance of an optimal level of AR condensation in mediating AR-AR homotypic and AR-cofactor heterotypic interactions to regulate enhancer assembly in response to signals. Our study supports the notion that alteration of the fine-tuned multivalent IDR-IDR interactions might underlie AR-related human pathologies, thereby providing novel molecular insights for potential therapeutic strategies to treat prostate cancer and other AR-involved diseases by targeting AR multivalent interactions.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen fixation is the major source of reactive nitrogen in the ocean and has been considered to occur specifically in low-latitude oligotrophic oceans. Recent studies have shown that nitrogen fixation also occurs in the polar regions and thus is a global process, although the physiological and ecological characteristics of polar diazotrophs are not yet known. Here, we successfully reconstructed genomes, including that of cyanobacterium UCYN-A (Candidatus  Atelocyanobacterium thalassa), from metagenome data corresponding to 111 samples isolated from the Arctic Ocean. These diazotrophs were highly abundant in the Arctic Ocean (max., 1.28% of the total microbial community), suggesting that they have important roles in the Arctic ecosystem and biogeochemical cycles. Diazotrophs in the Arctic Ocean were either Arctic-specific or universal species. Arctic-specific diazotrophs, including Arctic UCYN-A, had unique gene sets (e.g., aromatics degradation) and/or a very small cell size (<0.2 {micro}m), suggesting adaptations to Arctic-specific conditions. Universal diazotrophs were generally heterotrophs and commonly had the gene that encodes the cold-inducible RNA chaperone, which presumably makes their survival possible even in deep, cold waters and polar regions. Thus both types of diazotroph have physiological traits adaptable to their environments, which allow nitrogen fixation on a global scale.",

    "abstract": "Given the ever-present threat of antibacterial resistance, there is an urgent need to identify new antibacterial drugs and targets. One such target is alanine racemase (Alr), an enzyme required for bacterial cell-wall biosynthesis. Alr is an attractive drug target because it is essential for bacterial survival but is absent in humans. Here, we investigate the Alr from M. tuberculosis (MT), the pathogen responsible for human tuberculosis, as a model Alr enzyme. MT-Alr functions exclusively as an obligate homodimer formed by two identical monomers. Both monomers contribute to the overall composition of their active sites. Therefore, disrupting the dimer interface could inhibit MT-Alr activity. Using computational methods, we identified seven interfacial residues predicted to be responsible for MT-Alr dimerization. Mutating one of the seven residues, Lys261, to alanine resulted in a completely inactive enzyme. Further investigation suggested a potential drug-binding site near Lys261 that might be useful for allosteric drug discovery.\n\nSummaryThe bacterial protein alanine racemase (Alr) converts L-alanine to D-alanine, a critical component of the bacterial cell wall. Cycloserine, a known antibiotic, inhibits Alr by binding to the same pocket that alanine binds. Several human proteins have similar pockets, so cycloserine has severe side effects. We identified additional Alr pockets and discovered that altering one of them abolishes Alr activity. Molecules that bind this pocket may similarly impact Alr activity, helping to address the ongoing antibiotic resistance crisis.",

Recent advances in RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry (MS) methods have identified over 140 of these modifications on a wide variety of RNA species. Most next-generation sequencing approaches can only map one RNA modification at a time, and while MS can assign multiple modifications simultaneously in an unbiased manner, MS cannot accurately catalog and assign RNA modifications in complex biological samples due to limitations in fragment length and coverage depth. Thus, a facile method to identify novel RNA modifications while simultaneously locating them in the context of their RNA sequences is still lacking. We combined two orthogonal modes of RNA ion separation before mass-spectrometry identification: high-field asymmetric ion mobility separation (FAIMS) and electrochemically modulated liquid chromatography (EMLC). FAIMS RNA-MS increases both coverage and throughput, while the EMLC LC-MS orthogonally separates RNA of different length and charge. The combination of the two methods offers a broadly applicable platform to improve length and depth of MS-based RNA sequencing while providing contextual access to the analysis of RNA modifications.",

Decline of PNPO activity under prolonged hypoxia reduced an active form of vitamin B6, pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP), and inhibited lysosomal activity, leading to the augmentation of inflammatory response of macrophages.

    "abstract": "There is a need to develop appropriate balance training interventions to minimize the risk of falls. Recently, we found that intermittent visual occlusions can substantially improve the effectiveness and retention of balance beam walking practice (Symeonidou and Ferris 2022). We sought to determine how the intermittent visual occlusions affect electrocortical activity during beam walking. We hypothesized that areas involved in sensorimotor processing and balance control would demonstrate spectral power changes and inter-trial coherence modulations after loss and restoration of vision. Ten healthy young adults practiced walking on a treadmill-mounted balance beam while wearing high-density EEG and experiencing reoccurring visual occlusions. Results revealed spectral power fluctuations and inter-trial coherence changes in the visual, occipital, temporal, and sensorimotor cortex as well as the posterior parietal cortex and the anterior cingulate. We observed a prolonged alpha increase in the occipital, temporal, sensorimotor, and posterior parietal cortex after the occlusion onset. In contrast, the anterior cingulate showed a strong alpha and theta increase after the occlusion offset. We observed transient phase synchrony in the alpha, theta, and beta bands within the sensory, posterior parietal, and anterior cingulate cortices immediately after occlusion onset and offset. Our results provide support for cross-modal phase resetting and enhanced processing in areas involved in sensory processing and balance control as an explanation for increased long-term balance improvement when training with intermittent visual occlusions. Our training intervention could be implemented in senior and rehabilitation centers, improving the quality of life of elderly and neurologically impaired individuals.",

In addition, it remains unclear to what extent tau pathology and the local inflammatory response within the brain influence the broader immune system.\n\nMethodsTo address these questions, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from carriers of pathogenic variants in MAPT, the gene encoding tau.\n\nResultsAnalysis of [~]181,000 individual PBMC transcriptomes from MAPT pathogenic variant carriers (n = 8) and healthy non-carrier controls (n = 8) demonstrated striking differential expression in monocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. We observed a marked reduction in the expression of CX3CR1 - the gene encoding the fractalkine receptor that is known to modulate tau pathology in mouse models - in monocytes and NK cells. We also observed a significant reduction in the abundance of nonclassical monocytes and dysregulated expression of nonclassical monocyte marker genes, including FCGR3A. Finally, we identified reductions in TMEM176A and TMEM176B, genes thought to be involved in the inflammatory response in human microglia. We confirmed differential expression of select biologically relevant genes dysregulated in our scRNA-seq data using droplet digital PCR as an orthogonal technique for quantitative validation.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggest that human peripheral immune cell expression and abundance are modulated by tau-associated pathophysiologic changes.

This difficulty is mitigated if a vertical visual background is available. Tilted visual backgrounds induce feelings of head tilt in subjects who are in fact upright. This is often explained as a result of the brain resorting to the prior assumption that natural visual backgrounds are vertical. Here, we tested whether monkeys show comparable perceptual mechanisms. To this end we trained two monkeys to align a visual arrow to a vertical reference line that had variable luminance across trials, while including a large, clearly visible background square whose orientation changed from trial to trial. On around 20% of all trials, the vertical reference line was left out to measure the subjective visual vertical (SVV). When the frame was upright, the monkeys SVV was aligned with the gravitational vertical. In accordance with the perceptual reports of humans, however, when the frame was tilted, it induced an illusion of head tilt as indicated by a bias in SVV towards the frame orientation. Thus all primates exploit the prior assumption that the visual world is vertical.",

    "abstract": "Neuromodulators such as dopamine have been shown to modulate short-term synaptic plasticity (STP). Here we propose that the neuromodulation of STP provides a general mechanism to scale neural dynamics and motor outputs in time and space. We trained RNNs that incorporated STP to produce complex motor trajectories--handwritten digits--with different temporal (speed) and spatial (size) scales. The learned dynamics underwent temporal and spatial scaling when higher synaptic release probabilities corresponded to higher speed/size. Neuromodulation of STP enhanced temporal or spatial generalization compared to weight modulation alone. The model accounted for the data of two experimental studies involving flexible sensorimotor timing. Our results address a long-standing debate regarding the role of dopamine in timing and predict novel mechanisms by which dopamine may slow down neural dynamics and thus slow \"clock\" speed.",

    "abstract": "Overeating is driven by both the hedonic component ( liking) of food, and the motivation ( wanting) to eat it. The nucleus accumbens (NAc) is a key brain center implicated in these processes, but how distinct NAc cell populations encode  liking and  wanting to shape overconsumption remains unclear. Here, we probed the roles of NAc D1 and D2 cells in these processes using cell-specific recording and control in diverse behavioral paradigms that disentangle reward traits of  liking and  wanting related to food choice and overeating. NAc D2 cells encoded experience-dependent development of  liking, while NAc D1 cells encoded innate  liking during the first food taste. Optogenetic control confirmed causal links of D1 and D2 cells to these aspects of  liking. In relation to  wanting, D1 and D2 cells encoded and promoted distinct aspects of food approach: D1 cells interpreted food cues while D2 cells also sustained food-visit-length that facilitates consumption. Finally, at the level of food choice, D1, but not D2, cell activity was sufficient to switch food preference, programming subsequent long-lasting overconsumption. By revealing complementary roles of D1 and D2 cells in consumption, these findings assign neural bases to  liking and  wanting in a unifying framework of D1 and D2 cell activity.",

    "abstract": "Stress is prevalent in the lives of those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and influences SUD outcomes. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms through which stress promotes drug use is important for the development of effective SUD interventions. We have developed a model wherein exposure to a stressor, uncontrollable electric footshock, daily at the time of cocaine self-administration (SA) escalates intake in male rats. Here we test the hypothesis that stress-induced escalation of cocaine SA requires CB1 cannabinoid receptor signaling. Male Sprague-Dawley rats self-administered cocaine (0.5 mg/kg/inf, i.v.) during 2-h sessions comprised of four 30-min SA components separated by 5-min shock sequences or 5-min shock-free periods for 14 days. Footshock produced an escalation of cocaine SA that persisted following shock removal. Systemic administration of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R) antagonist, AM251, attenuated cocaine intake only in rats with a history of stress. This effect was localized to the mesolimbic system, as intra-nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell and intra-ventral tegmental area (VTA) micro-infusions of AM251 attenuated cocaine intake only in stress-escalated rats. Cocaine SA, regardless of stress history, increases CB1R binding site density in the VTA, but not NAc shell. Following extinction, cocaine-primed reinstatement (10 mg/kg, ip) was increased in rats with prior footshock during SA. AM251 attenuated reinstatement only in rats with a stress history. Altogether, these data demonstrate that mesolimbic CB1R signaling is required to escalate intake and heighten relapse susceptibility and suggest that repeated stress at the time of cocaine use enhances mesolimbic CB1R signaling through a currently unknown mechanism.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated how proactive and reactive cognitive control processing in the brain was associated with habitual sleep health. BOLD fMRI data was acquired from 81 healthy adults with normal sleep (41 females, age 20.96 - 39.58 years) during a test of cognitive control (Not-X CPT). Sleep health was assessed in the week before MRI scanning, using both objective (actigraphy) and self-report measures. Multiple measures indicating poorer sleep health - including later/more variable sleep timing, later chronotype preference, more insomnia symptoms and lower sleep efficiency - were associated with stronger and more widespread BOLD activations in fronto-parietal and subcortical brain regions during cognitive control processing (adjusted for age, sex, education, and fMRI task performance). Most associations were found for reactive cognitive control activation, indicating that poorer sleep health is linked to a  hyper-reactive brain state. Analysis of time-on-task effects showed that, with longer time on task, poorer sleep health was predominantly associated with increased proactive cognitive control activation, indicating recruitment of additional neural resources over time. Finally, shorter objective sleep duration was associated with lower BOLD activation with time on task and poorer task performance. In conclusion, even in  normal sleepers, relatively poorer sleep health is associated with altered cognitive control processing, possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms and / or inefficient neural processing.",

Extensive work on their functional relationships has led to the salience network theory and advanced understanding of value-based learning and decision making. However, the anatomical connections between the ACC and the two regions remain unknown in the human brain. Despite the anatomical ground truth established by nonhuman primate (NHP) tract-tracing, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has not seen success identifying homologous pathways in humans. In this study we show that the negative finding does not reflect a cross-species discrepancy but rather a technical issue. We used NHP dMRI as a bridge to compare the ground-truth pathways in NHPs and dMRI-derived pathways in humans. The insight from NHP data helped pinpoint a bias in fiber orientation distribution functions (fODFs) caused by the disproportion of anterior-posterior vs. medial-lateral fibers in the human brain. Guided by this information, we successfully recovered the ACC-insula and ACC-vlPFC pathways that followed the same trajectories as in the NHP dMRI and tract-tracing data. Our findings provide an anatomical basis for the functional interactions among the ACC, the insula and the vlPFC.",

Despite recent technological advances, especially single cell labeling and whole brain imaging, for many prevailing animal models, it is exceedingly challenging to reuse similar technologies to study human brains. Here we propose Adaptive Cell Tomography (ACTomography), a low-cost, high-throughput, high-efficacy tomography approach, based on adaptive targeting of individual cells suitable for human-brain scale modeling of single neurons to characterize their 3-D structures, statistical distributions, and extensible for other cellular features. Specifically, we established a platform to inject dyes into cortical neurons in surgical tissues of 18 patients with brain tumors or other conditions and 1 donated fresh postmortem brain. We collected 3-D images of 1746 cortical neurons, of which 852 neurons were subsequentially reconstructed to quantify their local dendritic morphology, and mapped to standard atlases both computationally and semantically. In our data, human neurons are more diverse across brain regions than by subject age or gender. The strong stereotypy within cohorts of brain regions allows generating a statistical tensor-field of neuron morphology to characterize 3-D anatomical modularity of a human brain.",

    "abstract": "The increase of brain neuron number in relation with brain size is currently considered to be the major evolutionary path to high cognitive power in amniotes. However, how changes in neuron density did contribute to the evolution of the information-processing capacity of the brain remains unanswered. High neuron densities are seen as the main reason why the fovea located at the optical center of the retina is responsible for sharp vision in birds and primates. The emergence of foveal vision is considered as a breakthrough innovation in visual system evolution. We found that neuron densities in the largest visual center of the midbrain - i.e., the optic tectum - are two to four times higher in modern birds with one or two foveae compared to birds deprived of this specialty. Interspecies comparisons enabled us to identify elements of a hitherto unknown developmental process set up by foveate birds for increasing neuron density in the upper layers of their optic tectum. The late progenitor cells that generate these neurons proliferate in a ventricular zone that can expand only radially. In this particular context, the number of cells in ontogenetic columns increases, thereby setting the conditions for higher cell densities in the upper layers once neurons did migrate.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=191 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/514341v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (32K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1861345org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15b5557org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13fec7borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bea1bb_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIThe presence of a fovea is associated with increased neuron density in the optic tectum\nC_LIO_LIFovea number and deepness influence neuron density in the optic tectum\nC_LIO_LIIncreased neuron density in the upper layers of the optic tectum requires major developmental changes\nC_LIO_LIPostponed cell migration, prolonged cell proliferation, hindered tissue growth are necessary settings for achieving high neuron density\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Speech processing often occurs amidst competing inputs from other modalities, e.g., listening to the radio while driving. We examined the extent to which dividing attention between auditory and visual modalities (bimodal divided attention) impacts neural processing of natural continuous speech from acoustic to linguistic levels of representation. We recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) responses when human participants performed a challenging primary visual task, imposing low or high cognitive load while listening to audiobook stories as a secondary task. The two dual-task conditions were contrasted with an auditory single-task condition in which participants attended to stories while ignoring visual stimuli. Behaviorally, the high load dual-task condition was associated with lower speech comprehension accuracy relative to the other two conditions. We fitted multivariate temporal response function encoding models to predict EEG responses from acoustic and linguistic speech features at different representation levels, including auditory spectrograms and information-theoretic models of sublexical-, word-form-, and sentence-level representations. Neural tracking of most acoustic and linguistic features remained unchanged with increasing dual-task load, despite unambiguous behavioral and neural evidence of the high load dual-task condition being more demanding. Compared to the auditory single-task condition, dual-task conditions selectively reduced neural tracking of only some acoustic and linguistic features, mainly at latencies >200 ms, while earlier latencies were surprisingly unaffected. These findings indicate that behavioral effects of bimodal divided attention on continuous speech processing occur not due to impaired early sensory representations but likely at later cognitive processing stages. Crossmodal attention-related mechanisms may not be uniform across different speech processing levels.",

However, validating its applicability as a measure of cortical cytoarchitecture demands analyzing the complex resulting laminar datasets. In this study, we adapt and implement an algorithm for clustering cell omics profiles to cluster these complex microstructural cortical datasets. The resulting clusters correspond with an established atlas of cytoarchitectonic features, providing robust validation of T1 imaging as a tool for exploring cortical laminar composition.

    "abstract": "A broad array of endosymbionts radiate through host populations via vertical transmission, yet much remains unknown concerning the cellular basis, diversity and routes underlying this transmission strategy. Here we address these issues, by examining the cellular distributions of Wolbachia strains that diverged up to 50 million years ago in the oocytes of 18 divergent Drosophila species. This analysis revealed three Wolbachia distribution patterns: 1) a tight clustering at the posterior pole plasm (the site of germline formation); 2) a concentration at the posterior pole plasm, but with a significant bacteria population distributed throughout the oocyte; 3) and a distribution throughout the oocyte, with none or very few located at the posterior pole plasm. Examination of this latter class indicates Wolbachia accesses the posterior pole plasm during the interval between late oogenesis and the blastoderm formation. We also find that one Wolbachia strain in this class concentrates in the posterior somatic follicle cells that encompass the pole plasm of the developing oocyte. In contrast, strains in which Wolbachia concentrate at the posterior pole plasm generally exhibit no or few Wolbachia in the follicle cells associated with the pole plasm. Taken together, these studies suggest that for some Drosophila species, Wolbachia invade the germline from neighboring somatic follicle cells. Phylogenomic analysis indicates that closely related Wolbachia strains tend to exhibit similar patterns of posterior localization, suggesting that specific localization strategies are a function of Wolbachia-associated factors. Previous studies revealed that endosymbionts rely on one of two distinct routes of vertical transmission: continuous maintenance in the germline (germline-to-germline) or a more circuitous route via the soma (germline-to-soma-to-germline). Here we provide compelling evidence that Wolbachia strains infecting Drosophila species maintain the diverse arrays of cellular mechanisms necessary for both of these distinct transmission routes. This characteristic may account for its ability to infect and spread globally through a vast range of host insect species.",

    "abstract": "Engineering human tissue with diverse cell types and desired cellular architectures and functions is a considerable challenge. The cerebral cortex, which has a layered cellular architecture composed of layer-specific neurons organised into vertical columns, delivers higher cognition through intricately wired neural circuits. However, current tissue engineering approaches cannot produce such structures. Here, we use a droplet printing technique to fabricate tissues comprising simplified cerebral cortical columns. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were differentiated into upper- and deep-layer neural progenitors, which were then printed to form cerebral cortical tissues with a two-layer organization. The tissues showed layer-specific biomarker expression and developed an integrated network of processes. Implantation of the printed cortical tissues into mouse brain explants resulted in substantial implant-host integration across the tissue boundaries as demonstrated by the projection of processes, the migration of neurons and the appearance of correlated Ca2+ signals. The approach we have developed might be used for the evaluation of drugs and nutrients that promote tissue integration. Importantly, our approach might be applied in personalised implantation treatments that restore the cellular structure and function of a damaged brain by using 3D tissues derived from a patients own iPSCs.",

    "abstract": "Associative learning during delay eyeblink conditioning (EBC) depends on an intact cerebellum. However, the relative contribution of changes in the cerebellar nuclei to learning remains a subject of ongoing debate. In particular, little is known about the changes in synaptic inputs to cerebellar nuclei neurons that take place during EBC and how they shape the membrane potential of these neurons. Here, we probed the ability of these inputs to support associative learning in mice, and investigated structural and cell-physiological changes within the cerebellar nuclei during learning. We find that optogenetic stimulation of mossy fiber afferents to the anterior interposed nucleus (AIP) can substitute for a conditioned stimulus and is sufficient to elicit conditioned responses (CRs) that are adaptively well-timed. Further, EBC induces structural changes in mossy fiber and inhibitory inputs, but not of climbing fiber inputs, and it leads to changes in subthreshold processing of AIP neurons that correlate with conditioned eyelid movements. The changes in synaptic and spiking activity that precede the CRs allow for a decoder to distinguish trials with a CR. Our data reveal how structural and physiological modifications of synaptic inputs to cerebellar nuclei neurons can facilitate learning.",

    "abstract": "Neural information routing relies on spatiotemporal activity dynamics across interconnected brain areas. However, it remains unclear how routing states emerge at fast spiking timescales and interact with the slower activity dynamics of larger networks during cognitive processes.\n\nHere, we show that localized neural spiking events generate long-range directional routing states with spiking activity in distant brain areas that dynamically switch or amplify during oscillatory bursts, selective attention, and decision-making. Computational modeling and neural recordings from lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and striatum of nonhuman primates revealed that cross-areal, directional routing states arise within [~]20 ms around spikes of single neurons. On average, LPFC spikes led activity in the ACC and striatum by few milliseconds. The routing state was amplified during LPFC beta bursts between the LPFC and striatum and switched direction during ACC theta/alpha bursts between ACC and LPFC. Selective attention amplified the lead of these theta/alpha-specific lead-ensembles in the ACC, while decision-making amplified the lead of ACC and LPFC spiking output over the striatum. Notably, the fast lead/lag relationships of cross-areal neuronal ensembles that were modulated by attention states or decision-making predicted firing rate dynamics of their neurons during those functional states at slower timescales. Overall, our findings demonstrate directional routing of spiking activity across nonhuman primate frontal and striatal areas, as well as the functional and network states that modulate the direction and magnitude of these interactions.\n\nSummaryFast spatio-temporal dynamics of brain activity subserves the routing of information across distant regions and is integral to flexible cognition, decision-making, and selective attention. This study demonstrates that routing dynamics emerge as 20 ms brief lead and lag relationships of spiking activities across distant brain areas. The direction and magnitude of the lead and lag relationships systematically switched during frequency-specific oscillatory bursts and when attention shifts to visual cues.",

    "abstract": "During reward-based learning tasks, animals make orofacial movements that globally influence brain activity at the timings of reward expectation and acquisition. These orofacial movements are not explicitly instructed and typically appear along with goal-directed behaviors. Here we show that reinforcing optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons (oDAS) in mice is sufficient to induce orofacial movements in the whiskers and nose without accompanying goal-directed behaviors. Pavlovian conditioning with a sensory cue and oDAS elicited cue-locked and oDAS aligned orofacial movements, which were distinguishable by a machine learning model. Inhibition or knock-out of dopamine D1 receptors in the nucleus accumbens inhibited oDAS-induced motion but spared cue-locked motion, suggesting differential neural regulation of these two types of orofacial motions. In contrast, inactivation of the whisker primary motor cortex (wM1) abolished both types of orofacial movements. We found specific neuronal populations in wM1 representing either oDAS-aligned or cue-locked whisker movements. Notably, optogenetic stimulation of wM1 neurons successfully replicated these two types of movements. Our results thus suggest that accumbal D1 receptor-dependent and -independent neuronal signals converge in the wM1 for facilitating uninstructed orofacial movements during a reward-based learning task.",

    "abstract": "Neurons respond to changes in the levels of activity they experience in a variety of ways, including structural changes at pre- and postsynaptic terminals. An essential plasticity signal required for such activity-regulated structural adjustments are reactive oxygen species (ROS). To identify sources of activity-regulated ROS required for structural plasticity in vivo we used the Drosophila larval neuromuscular junction as a highly tractable experimental model system. For adjustments of presynaptic motor terminals, we found a requirement for both NADPH oxidases, Nox and Dual Oxidase (Duox), that are encoded in the Drosophila genome. This contrasts with the postsynaptic dendrites from which Nox is excluded. NADPH oxidases generate ROS to the extracellular space. Here, we show that two aquaporins, Bib and Drip, are necessary ROS conduits in the presynaptic motoneuron for activity regulated, NADPH oxidase dependent changes in presynaptic motoneuron terminal growth. Our data further suggest that different aspects of neuronal activity-regulated structural changes might be regulated by different ROS sources: changes in bouton number require both NADPH oxidases, while activity-regulated changes in the number of active zones might be modulated by other sources of ROS. Overall, our results show NADPH oxidases as important enzymes for mediating activity-regulated plasticity adjustments in neurons.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundChoroid plexus (ChP) enlargement exists in first-episode and chronic psychosis, but whether enlargement occurs before psychosis onset is unknown. This study investigated whether ChP volume is enlarged in individuals with clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis and whether these changes are related to clinical, neuroanatomical, and plasma analytes.\n\nMethodsClinical and neuroimaging data from the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study 2 (NAPLS2) was used for analysis. 509 participants (169 controls, 340 CHR) were recruited. Conversion status was determined after 2-years of follow-up, with 36 psychosis converters. The lateral ventricle ChP was manually segmented from baseline scans. A subsample of 31 controls and 53 CHR had plasma analyte and neuroimaging data.\n\nResultsCompared to controls, CHR (d=0.23, p=0.017) and non-converters (d=0.22, p=0.03) demonstrated higher ChP volumes, but not in converters. In CHR, greater ChP volume correlated with lower cortical (r=-0.22, p<0.001), subcortical gray matter (r=-0.21, p<0.001), and total white matter volume (r=-0.28,p<0.001), as well as larger lateral ventricle volume (r=0.63,p<0.001). Greater ChP volume correlated with makers functionally associated with the lateral ventricle ChP in CHR [CCL1 (r=-0.30, p=0.035), ICAM1 (r=0.33, p=0.02)], converters [IL1{beta} (r=0.66, p=0.004)], and non-converters [BMP6 (r=-0.96, p<0.001), CALB1 (r=-0.98, p<0.001), ICAM1 (r=0.80, p=0.003), SELE (r=0.59, p=0.026), SHBG (r=0.99, p<0.001), TNFRSF10C (r=0.78, p=0.001)].\n\nConclusionsCHR and non-converters demonstrated significantly larger ChP volumes compared to controls. Enlarged ChP was associated with neuroanatomical alterations and analyte markers functionally associated with the ChP. These findings suggest that the ChP may be a key explanatory biomarker in CHR for psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal cell motility is mainly regulated by two members of the Rho-family of GTPases, called Rac and Rho. The mutual inhibition exerted by these two proteins on each others activation and the promotion of Rac activation by an adaptor protein called paxillin have been implicated in driving cellular polarization comprised of front (high active Rac) and back (high active Rho) during cell migration. Mathematical modeling of this regulatory network has previously shown that bistability is responsible for generating a spatiotemporal pattern underscoring cellular polarity called wave-pinning when diffusion is included. We previously developed a 6D reaction-diffusion model of this network to decipher the role of Rac, Rho and paxillin (along with other auxiliary proteins) in generating wave-pinning. In this study, we simplify this model through a series of steps into an excitable 3D ODE model comprised of one fast variable (the scaled concentration of active Rac), one slow variable (the maximum paxillin phosphorylation rate - turned into a variable) and a very slow variable (a recovery rate - also turned into a variable). We then explore, through slow-fast analysis, how excitability is manifested by showing that the model can exhibit relaxation oscillations (ROs) as well as mixed-mode oscillations (MMOs) whose underlying dynamics are consistent with a delayed Hopf bifurcation. By reintroducing diffusion and the scaled concentration of inactive Rac into the model, we obtain a 4D PDE model that generates several unique spatiotemporal patterns that are relevant to cell motility. These patterns are then characterized and their impact on cell motility are explored by employing the cellular potts model (CPM). Our results reveal that wave pinning produces purely very directed motion in CPM, while MMOs allow for meandering and non-motile behaviours to occur. This highlights the role of MMOs as a potential mechanism for mesenchymal cell motility.",

    "abstract": "Blood vessels play a critical role in pancreatic islet health and function, yet current culture methods to generate islet organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (SC-islets) lack a vascular component. Here, we engineered 3D vascularized SC-islet organoids by assembling SC-islet cells, human primary endothelial cells (ECs) and fibroblasts both in a non-perfused model and a microfluidic device with perfused vessels. Vasculature improved stimulus-dependent Ca2+ influx into SC-{beta}-cells, a hallmark of {beta}-cell function that is blunted in non-vascularized SC-islets. We show that an islet-like basement membrane is formed by vasculature and contributes to the functional improvement of SC-{beta}-cells. Furthermore, cell-cell communication networks based on scRNA-seq data predicted BMP2/4-BMPR2 signaling from ECs to SC-{beta}-cells. Correspondingly, BMP4 augmented the SC-{beta}-cell Ca2+ response and insulin secretion. These vascularized SC-islet models will enable further studies of crosstalk between {beta}-cells and ECs and can serve as in vivo-mimicking platforms for disease modeling and therapeutic testing.",

    "abstract": "Tissue repair requires a highly coordinated cellular response to injury. In the lung, alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells act as stem cells and can replace both themselves and alveolar type 1 cells (AT1); however, the complex orchestration of AT2 stem cell activity following lung injury is poorly understood owing to the inability of tracking individual stem cells and their dynamic behavior over time. Here, we apply live time lapse imaging to ex vivo mouse precision cut lung slice (PCLS) culture and in vivo mouse lung to track individual GFP-labeled AT2 cells following induction of alveolar injury by bleomycin. We observe highly dynamic movement of AT2 cells, including migration within and between alveoli. To map the dynamic evolution of AT2 cell behavior, we introduce Live Cell Encoder (LCE-PHATE), a novel method for converting static snapshots from time lapse imaging into single points representative of entire, dynamic cellular trajectories. Applying LCE-PHATE, we observe the emergence of at least three distinct morphokinetic AT2 cell states associated with AT2 stem cell injury response. Finally, small molecule-based inhibition of Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) pathway significantly reduced motility of AT2 stem cells following injury and reduced expression of Krt8, a marker of intermediate progenitor cells. Together, our results uncover motility of alveolar stem cells as a new injury response mechanism in the lung and reveal properties of stem cell motility at high cellular resolution.",

While the LBD literature is rich and the field is considered mature, standard practice in the evaluation of LBD methods is methodologically poor and has not progressed on par with the domain. The lack of properly designed and decent-sized benchmark dataset hinders the progress of the field and its development into applications usable by biomedical experts.\n\nResultsThis work presents a method for mining past discoveries from the biomedical literature. It leverages the impact made by a discovery, using descriptive statistics to detect surges in the prevalence of a relation across time. This method allows the collection of a large amount of time-stamped discoveries which can be used for LBD evaluation or other applications.

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that increases its prevalence with age. AD is characterized by a progressive loss of cognitive function, leading to dementia. The conventional pathological hallmarks of AD include deposition of amyloid plaque, aggregation of neurofibrillary tangles, and sustained inflammation. Recent studies have confirmed that immune responses play an important role in AD progression. Single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies of the AD mouse model identified the disease-associated microglia (DAM) population during AD progression, where the pro-inflammatory activity was mediated by Trem2. However, the time points and nature of DAM activation remain largely unknown. Here, we compared the time-result bulk sequencing andsingle nuclei RNA sequencing data in a mouse model of AD. We identified an age-dependent activation of Trem2 targeted immune-related genes. We showed that Trem2 affected DAM activation at an early stage (4-8 months) rather than the late stage (12-16 months). Our results highlight an age-dependent change in the Trem2-linked immune response in AD.",

    "abstract": "Under difficult viewing conditions, the brains visual system uses a variety of recurrent modulatory mechanisms to augment feed-forward processing. One resulting phenomenon is contour integration, which occurs in the primary visual (V1) cortex and strengthens neural responses to edges if they belong to a larger smooth contour. Computational models have contributed to an understanding of the circuit mechanisms of contour integration, but less is known about its role in visual perception. To address this gap, we embedded a biologically grounded model of contour integration in a task-driven artificial neural network, and trained it using a gradient-descent variant. We used this model to explore how brain-like contour integration may be optimized for high-level visual objectives as well as its potential roles in perception. When the model was trained to detect contours in a background of random edges, a task commonly used to examine contour integration in the brain, it closely mirrored the brain in terms of behavior, neural responses, and lateral connection patterns. When trained on natural images, the model enhanced weaker contours and distinguished whether two points lay on the same vs. different contours. The model learnt robust features that generalized well to out-of-training-distribution stimuli. Surprisingly, and in contrast with the synthetic task, a parameter-matched control network without recurrence performed the same or better than the model on the natural-image tasks. Thus a contour integration mechanism is not essential to perform these more naturalistic contour-related tasks. Finally, the best performance in all tasks was achieved by a modified contour integration model that did not distinguish between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.\n\nAuthor summaryDeep networks are machine-learning systems that consist of interconnected neuron-like elements. More than other kinds of artificial system, they rival human information processing in a variety of tasks. These structural and functional parallels have raised interest in using deep networks as simplified models of the brain, to better understand of brain function. For example, incorporating additional biological phenomena into deep networks may help to clarify how they affect brain function. In this direction, we adapted a deep network to incorporate a model of visual contour integration, a process in the brain that makes contours appear more visually prominent. We found that suitable training led this model to behave much like the corresponding brain circuits. We then investigated potential roles of the contour integration mechanism in processing of natural images, an important question that has been difficult to answer. The results were not straightforward. For example, the contour integration mechanism actually impaired the networks ability to tell whether two points lay on the same contour or not, but improved the networks ability to generalize this skill to a different group of images. Overall, this approach has raised more sophisticated questions about the role of contour integration in natural vision.",
