    "abstract": "Human environments comprise various sources of distraction, which often occur unexpectedly in time. The proneness to distraction (i.e., distractibility) is posited to be independent of attentional sampling of targets, but its temporal dynamics and neurobiological basis are largely unknown. Brain oscillations in the theta band (3 - 8 Hz) have been associated with fluctuating neural excitability, which is hypothesised here to explain rhythmic modulation of distractibility. In a pitch discrimination task (N = 30) with unexpected auditory distractors, we show that distractor-evoked neural responses in the electroencephalogram and perceptual susceptibility to distraction were co-modulated and cycled approximately 3 - 5 times per second. Pre-distractor neural phase in left inferior frontal and insular cortex regions explained fluctuating distractibility. Thus, human distractibility is not constant but fluctuates on a subsecond timescale. Furthermore, slow neural oscillations subserve the behavioural consequences of a hitherto largely unexplained but ever-increasing phenomenon in modern environments - distraction by unexpected sound.",

    "abstract": "Cortical neural dynamics mediate information processing for the cerebral cortex, implicated in fundamental biological processes, such as vision and olfaction, in addition to neurological and psychiatric diseases. Spontaneous pain is a key feature of human neuropathic pain. Whether spontaneous pain pushes cortical network into an aberrant state, and if so, whether it can be brought back to a  normal operating range to ameliorate pain are unknown. Using a clinically relevant mouse model of neuropathic pain with robust spontaneous pain-like behavior, we report that orofacial spontaneous pain activated a specific area within the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), displaying synchronized neural dynamics revealed by intravital two-photon calcium imaging. This synchronization was underpinned by local GABAergic interneuron hypoactivity. Pain-induced cortical synchronization could be attenuated by manipulating local S1 networks or clinically effective pain therapies. Specifically, both chemogenetic inhibition of pain-related c-Fos-expressing neurons, and selective activation of GABAergic interneurons, significantly attenuated S1 synchronization. Clinically effective pain therapies including carbamazepine and nerve root decompression could also dampen S1 synchronization. More importantly, restoring a  normal range of neural dynamics, through attenuating pain-induced S1 synchronization, alleviated pain-like behavior. These results suggest spontaneous pain pushes S1 regional network into a synchronized state, whereas reversal of this synchronization alleviates pain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMagnetoencephalography (MEG) is a widely used non-invasive tool to estimate brain activity with high temporal resolution. However, due to the ill-posed nature of the MEG source imaging (MSI) problem, the ability of MSI to identify accurately underlying brain sources along the cortical surface is still uncertain and requires validation.\n\nMethodWe validated the ability of MSI to estimate the background resting state activity of 45 healthy participants by comparing it to the intracranial EEG (IEEG) atlas (https://mni-open-ieegatlas.research.mcgill.ca/). First, we applied wavelet-based Maximum Entropy on the Mean (wMEM) as an MSI technique. Next, we converted MEG source maps into intracranial space, by applying a forward model to the MEG reconstructed source maps and estimated virtual IEEG (VIEEG) potentials on each IEEG channel location and quantitatively compared those with actual IEEG signals from the atlas for 38 regions of interest in the canonical frequency bands.\n\nResultsThe MEG spectra were more accurately estimated in the lateral regions compared to the medial regions. The regions with higher amplitude in the VIEEG than in the IEEG were more accurately recovered. In the deep regions, MEG estimated amplitudes were largely underestimated and the spectra were poorly recovered. Moreover, the MEG largely overestimated oscillatory peaks in the alpha band, especially in the anterior and deep regions. This is possibly due to higher phase synchronization of alpha oscillations over extended regions, exceeding the spatial sensitivity of IEEG but detected by MEG. Importantly, we found that MEG estimated spectra were more comparable to spectra from the IEEG atlas after the aperiodic components were removed.\n\nConclusionThis study identifies brain regions and frequencies for which MEG source analysis is likely to be reliable, a promising step towards resolving the uncertainty in recovering intracerebral activity from non-invasive MEG studies.\n\nHighlightsO_LIValidation of MEG source imaging with intracranial EEE atlas\nC_LIO_LIAssessment of resting state human brain oscillations from healthy brain\nC_LIO_LIAdapted source imaging method, wMEM, to localize resting state oscillations\nC_LIO_LIIdentified brain regions with oscillations accurately estimated by MEG\nC_LIO_LIMEG estimated spectra dominated by oscillations in the alpha band\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While the time-of-day significantly impacts motor performance, its effect on motor learning has not yet been elucidated. Here, we investigated the influence of the time-of-day on skill acquisition (i.e., skill improvement immediately after a training-session) and consolidation (i.e., skill retention after a time interval). Three groups were trained at 10 a.m. (G10am), 3 p.m. (G3pm), or 8 p.m. (G8pm) on a finger-tapping task. We recorded the skill (i.e. the ratio between movement duration and accuracy), before and immediately after the training to evaluate skill acquisition, and after 24 hours, to measure skill consolidation. We did not observe any difference in acquisition according to the time of the day. However, we found an improvement in performance 24 hours after the evening training (G8pm) while the morning (G10am) and the afternoon (G3pm) groups deteriorated and stabilized their performance, respectively. Furthermore, two control experiments (G8wake and G8sleep) supported the idea that a night of sleep contributes to the skill consolidation of the evening group. These results show an influence of time-of-day on the consolidation process, with better consolidation when the training is carried out in the evening. This finding may have an important impact on the planning of training programs in sports, clinical, or experimental domains.",

    "abstract": "Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is characterized by increased endocytosis and degradation of nephrin, a protein that comprises the molecular sieve of the glomerular filtration barrier, but the key trafficking mechanism that connects the initial endocytic events and the homeostasis of nephrin is unknown. Our work implicates cytoplasmic dynein, a transport complex that is upregulated in DN, plays a critical role in triaging the endocytosed nephrin between recycling and proteolytic pathways. Using Nephroseq platform, our transcription analysis in public DN databases revealed dynein overexpression in human DN and diabetic mouse kidney, correlated with the severity of hyperglycemia and nephropathy. The increased expression of dynein subunits was confirmed in high glucose-treated podocytes and in glomeruli isolated from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice. Using live cell imaging, we illustrated that dynein-mediated post-endocytic sorting of nephrin was upregulated, resulting in accelerated nephrin degradation and disrupted nephrin recycling. In diabetic podocytopathy, Dynll1 is one of the most upregulated dynein components that was recruited to endocytosed nephrin. This was corroborated by observing enhanced Dynll1-nephrin colocalization in podocytes of diabetic patients, as well as dynein-mediated trafficking and degradation of nephrin in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Knockdown of Dynll1 attenuated lysosomal degradation of nephrin and promoted its recycling, suggesting the essential role of Dynll1 in dynein-mediated mistrafficking. Defining the role of dynein-mediated mistrafficking of nephrin in diabetes will not only fill the knowledge gap about the early events of DN, but also inspire novel therapeutics that target a broad spectrum of molecular events involved in the dynein-mediated trafficking.\n\nTranslational StatementDiabetic nephropathy (DN), the leading cause of end stage kidney disease in the United States, is characterized by a podocytopathy with mistrafficking and depletion of the slit diaphragm protein nephrin, which in turn compromises the podocytes function in maintaining the glomerular filtration barrier. There is a critical need to define the trafficking mechanisms underlying the depletion of nephrin. Our work implicates cytoplasmic dynein, a trafficking complex that connects diabetes-triggered endocytosis with proteolytic pathways. Delineation of the dynein-driven pathogenesis of diabetic podocytopathy will inspire new therapies that potentially target a broad spectrum of molecules involved in dynein-mediated trafficking and degradation pathways.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Individuals with MDD exhibit decreased motivation and deficits in reward processing along with chronically elevated levels of the  stress hormone, cortisol. However, the mechanistic relationship between chronically elevated cortisol and behavioral deficits in motivation and reward processing remains unclear. Given that women are diagnosed with MDD at twice the rate of men, it is important to understand whether the mechanisms linking chronically elevated cortisol to the symptoms of MDD differ by sex.\n\nMethodsWe used subcutaneous implants to chronically elevate free plasma corticosterone (rodent homolog of cortisol;  CORT) in male and female mice and examined changes in behavior and dopamine system function. We used operant training to assay reward-guided motivation and high-performance liquid chromatography to quantify striatal dopamine content. We assessed dopamine transporter (DAT) function using ex vivo slice imaging and in vivo fiber photometry in combination with a fluorescent dopamine sensor, dLight1.3b. We further quantified DAT expression and phosphorylation using western blot.\n\nResultsWe found that chronic CORT treatment impaired reward-seeking in both sexes. In female but not male mice, CORT treatment reduced dopamine content in the dorsomedial striatum (DMS). In male but not female mice, the function of the dopamine transporter (DAT) was impaired in DMS.\n\nConclusionsChronic elevation of CORT impairs reward-seeking by impairing dopaminergic transmission in the DMS, but via different mechanisms in male and female mice. A better understanding of these sex-specific mechanisms could lead to new directions in MDD diagnosis and treatment.",

    "abstract": "The murine oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model is one of the most widely used animal models of ischemic retinopathy, mimicking hallmark pathophysiology of initial vaso-obliteration (VO) resulting in ischemia that drives neovascularization (NV). In addition to NV and VO, human ischemic retinopathies including Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) are characterized by increased vascular tortuosity. Vascular tortuosity is an indicator of disease severity, need to treat, and treatment response in ROP. Current literature investigating novel therapeutics in the OIR model report their effects on NV and VO, but no standardized quantification of vascular tortuosity exists to date despite this metrics relevance to human disease in clinics. The current proof-of-concept study applied a computer-based image analysis algorithm capable of calculating standardized measurements of vascular tortuosity. Quantification of vascular tortuosity correlated with disease activity in OIR analogously to that observed in infants with ROP. Treatment of OIR mice with anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (aflibercept) rescued vascular tortuosity in the model. Altogether, these data demonstrated that vascular tortuosity is a quantifiable feature of the OIR model and may be used as an outcome measurement in future studies investigating new treatment modalities for retinal ischemia.",

    "abstract": "We present the first analysis of the connectome of the vertical lobe (VL) of Octopus vulgaris, a brain structure mediating acquisition of long-term memory in this behaviorally advanced mollusk. Serial section electron microscopy revealed new types of interneurons, cellular components of extensive modulatory systems and multiple synaptic motifs. The sensory input to the VL is conveyed via ~1,800,000 axons that sparsely innervate two parallel and interconnected feedforward networks formed by the two types of amacrine interneurons (AM), simple AMs (SAMs) and complex AMs (CAMs). SAMs make up 89.3% of the ~25,000,000 VL cells, each receiving a synaptic input from only a single input neuron on its non-bifurcating primary neurite, suggesting that each input neuron is represented in only ~12 SAMs. This synaptic site is likely a \"memory site\" as it is endowed with LTP. The CAMs, a newly described AM type, comprise 1.6% of the VL cells. Their bifurcating neurites integrate multiple inputs from the input axons and SAMs. While the SAM network appears to feedforward sparse \"memorizable\" sensory representations into the VL output layer, the CAMs appear to monitor global activity and feedforward a balancing inhibition for \"sharpening\" the stimulus-specific VL output. While sharing morphological and wiring features with circuits supporting associative learning in other animals, the VL has evolved a unique circuit that enables associative learning based strictly on feedforward information flow.",

    "abstract": "Sterols are versatile lipids primarily associated with eukaryotes. While bacteria also produce sterols and studies of bacterial biosynthesis proteins have revealed novel biosynthetic pathways and a potential evolutionary role in the origin of sterol biosynthesis, no bacterium has been shown to synthesize highly modified eukaryotic sterols, such as cholesterol. This has led to the notion that bacteria only produce biosynthetically simple sterols and has lessened the consideration of bacterial production in discussions of sterol biosynthesis. In this study, we demonstrate two phylogenetically distinct bacteria, Enhygromyxa salina and Calothrix sp. NIES-4105, are capable of de novo cholesterol production. We also identified 25-hydroxycholesterol released as a product of acid hydrolysis in extracts from both bacteria, suggesting cholesterol exists as a conjugated molecule in these organisms. We coupled our lipid extractions to bioinformatic analyses and heterologous expression experiments to identify genetic pathways driving cholesterol production in each bacterium. E. salina shares much of its cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with the canonical eukaryotic pathway, except for C-4 demethylation where we identified a unique variation on the bacterial C-4 demethylation pathway. Calothrix lacks homologs for several steps in cholesterol biosynthesis, suggesting this bacterium may harbor a novel mechanism for completing cholesterol biosynthesis. Altogether, these results demonstrate the complexity underpinning bacterial sterol biosynthesis and raise further questions about the functional and regulatory roles of sterols in bacteria.",

Currently, the Malayan, Chinese and Philippine pangolins are all designated as critically-endangered species. Although few pangolin viruses have been described, their viromes have received more attention following the discovery that they harbour sarbecoviruses related to SARS-CoV-2. Using a large-scale genome mining strategy, we discovered novel lineages of papillomaviruses infecting the Malayan and Chinese pangolins. We were able to assemble 3 complete circular papillomavirus genomes with an intact coding capacity, and 5 additional L1 genes encoding the major capsid protein. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 7 out of 8 L1 sequences formed a monophyletic group which is the sister lineage to the Tree shrew papillomavirus 1, isolated from Yunnan province in China. Additionally, a single L1 sequence assembled from a Chinese pangolin was placed in a clade closer to alpha- and omegapapillomaviruses. Examination of the SRA data from 95 re-sequenced genomes revealed that 49.3% Malayan pangolins and 50% Chinese pangolins, were positive for papillomavirus reads. Our results indicate that pangolins in South East Asia are the hosts to diverse and highly prevalent papillomaviruses, which may have implications for pangolin health and conservation.",

Here, we used root exudate stimulation on three Burkholderia and three Paraburkholderia strains isolated from rice roots to characterize their preliminary adaptation to the rice host at the transcriptomic level. Instead of the awaited genus-dependent adaptation, we observed a strongly species-specific response for all tested strains. While all bacteria originate from the rice environment, there are great disparities in their levels of adaptation following the sensing of root exudates. We further report the shared major functions that were differentially regulated in this early step of bacterial adaptation to plant colonization, including amino acids and putrescine metabolism, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway as well as cyclic diguanylate monophosphate (c-di-GMP) cycling.",

    "abstract": "Inflammasomes are cytosolic innate immune complexes that play a critical role in host defense against pathogens but can also contribute to inflammatory pathogenesis. Here, we find that the human inflammasome-forming sensor CARD8 senses HIV-1 infection via site-specific cleavage of the CARD8 N-terminus by the HIV protease (HIV-1PR). HIV-1PR cleavage of CARD8 induces pyroptotic cell death and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from infected cells, processes that we find are dependent on Toll-like receptor stimulation prior to viral infection. Our evolutionary analyses reveal that the HIV-1PR cleavage site in CARD8 is unique to humans, and that chimpanzee CARD8 does not recognize proteases from HIV or simian immunodeficiency viruses from chimpanzees (SIVcpz). In contrast, SIVcpz does cleave human CARD8, suggesting that SIVcpz was poised to activate the human CARD8 inflammasome prior to its cross-species transmission into humans and implicating the CARD8 inflammasome as a potential driver of HIV pathogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae is a leading cause of nosocomial and community acquired infections, making K. pneumoniae the second pathogen associated with the most deaths attributed to any antibiotic resistant infection. K. pneumoniae colonises the nasopharynx and the gastrointestinal tract in an asymptomatic manner without dissemination to other tissues; importantly gastrointestinal colonisation is a requisite for infection. Our understanding of K. pneumoniae colonisation is still based on interrogating mouse models in which animals are pre-treated with antibiotics to disturb the colonisation resistance imposed by the gut microbiome. In these models, infection disseminates to other tissues. Here, we report a murine model to allow for the study of the gastrointestinal colonisation of K. pneumoniae without tissue dissemination. Hypervirulent and antibiotic resistant strains stably colonise the gastrointestinal tract of in an inbred mouse population without antibiotic treatment. The small intestine is the primary site of colonisation followed by a transition to the colon over time without dissemination to other tissues. Our model also mimics the disease dynamics of metastatic K. pneumoniae strains able to disseminate from the gastrointestinal tract to other sterile sites. Colonisation is associated with mild to moderate histopathology, no significant inflammation, and no effect on the richness of the microbiome. Our model recapitulates the clinical scenario in which antibiotic treatment disturbs the colonisation of K. pneumoniae resulting in dissemination to other tissues. Finally, we establish that the capsule polysaccharide is necessary for the colonisation of the large intestine whereas the type VI secretion system contributes to colonisation across the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIMPORTANCEKlebsiella pneumoniae is one of the pathogens sweeping the World in the antibiotic resistance pandemic. Klebsiella colonises the nasopharynx and the gut of healthy subjects in an asymptomatic manner, being gut colonisation a requisite for infection. This makes essential to understand the gastrointestinal carriage to prevent Klebsiella infections. Current research models rely on the perturbation of the gut microbiome by antibiotics, resulting in an invasive infection. Here, we report a new model of K. pneumoniae gut colonisation that recapitulates key features of the asymptomatic human gastrointestinal tract colonisation. In our model, there is no need to disturb the microbiota to achieve stable colonization without dissemination to other tissues. Our model recapitulates the clinical scenario in which antibiotic treatment triggers invasive infection. We envision our model will be an excellent platform to test therapeutics to eliminate Klebsiella asymptomatic colonisation, and to investigate factors enhancing colonisation and invasive infections.",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs) is an emerging non-tuberculosis mycobacterial (NTM) pathogen responsible for a wide variety of respiratory and cutaneous infections that are difficult to treat with standard antibacterial therapy. Mabs has a high degree of both innate and acquired antibiotic resistance to most clinically relevant drugs, including standard anti-mycobacterial agents. Ethionamide (ETH), an inhibitor of mycolic acid biosynthesis is currently utilized as a second-line agent for treating multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) infections. Here, we show that ETH has activity against clinical strains of Mabs in vitro at concentrations that are therapeutically achievable. Using transposon mutagenesis and whole genome sequencing of spontaneous drug-resistant mutants, we identified marR (MAB_2648c) as a genetic determinant of ETH sensitivity in Mabs. The gene marR encodes a transcriptional regulator of the TetR family of regulators. We show that MarR represses expression of MAB_2649 (mmpS5) and MAB_2650 (mmpL5). Further, we show that de-repression of these genes in marR mutants confers resistance to ETH, but not other antibiotics. To identify determinants of resistance that may be shared across antibiotics, we also performed Tn-Seq during treatment with amikacin and clarithromycin, drugs currently used clinically to treat Mabs. We found very little overlap in genes that modulate the sensitivity of Mabs to all three antibiotics, suggesting a high degree of specificity for resistance mechanisms in this emerging pathogen.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic resistant infections caused by Mycobacterium abscessus (Mabs) have been increasing in prevalence and treatment is often unsuccessful. Success rates range from 30-50%, primarily due to the high intrinsic resistance of Mabs to most clinically useful antibiotics. New therapeutic strategies, including repurposing of existing antibiotics, are urgently needed to improve treatment success rates. Here, we show that the anti-TB antibiotic ethionamide (ETH) has repurposing potential against Mabs, displaying bacteriostatic activity and delaying emergence of drug resistance when combined with clinically relevant antibiotics currently used against Mabs in vitro. We identified genes that modulated susceptibility of Mabs to ETH. marR encodes a transcriptional regulator that when deleted, confers ETH resistance. Our collective findings can be used to further explore the function of other genes that contribute to ETH susceptibility and help design the next generation of antibacterial regimens against Mabs that may potentially include ETH.",

    "abstract": "During a large-scale bacterial culturing effort of biofilms in the vicinity of a rainbow trout aquaculture facility in Idaho, USA, ten isolates were identified as having pathogen inhibiting activity and were characterized further. These isolates were shown to be Gram negative, rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. Whole genome comparisons and multi-locus sequence analysis using four housekeeping genes (16S rDNA, gyrA, rpoB, rpoD) showed that these 10 isolates clustered into four distinct species groups. These comparisons also indicated that these isolates were below the established species cutoffs for the genus Pseudomonas. Further phenotypic characterization using API 20NE, API ZYM, and BioLog GENIII assays and chemotaxonomic analysis of cellular fatty acids were carried out. Based on the genomic, physiological, and chemotaxonomic properties of these isolates, we concluded that these strains composed four novel species of Pseudomonas. The proposed names are: Pseudomonas apudapuas sp. nov. consisting of strains ID233, ID386T, and ID387 with ID386T (DSM 114641) as the type strain; Pseudomonas rubra sp. nov. consisting of strains ID291T, ID609, and ID1025 with ID291T (DSM 114640) as the type strain; Pseudomonas idahonensis sp. nov. consisting of strains ID357T and ID1048 with ID357T (DSM 114609) as the type strain; and Pseudomonas fontis sp. nov. consisting of strains ID656T and ID681 with ID656T (DSM 114610) as the type strain.",

    "abstract": "Dietary fibers are fermented in the human gut and are known to modulate microbiome composition and metabolic function, but few studies have explored to what extent the small variations in complex fiber structures impact community assembly, microbial division of labor, and organismal metabolic responses across individuals microbiome structures. To test the hypothesis that subtle linkage variations in chemical structures of polysaccharides afford different ecological niches for distinct communities and metabolism, we employed a 7-day in vitro sequential batch fermentation with fecal inocula from individual donors and measured microbial responses using an integrated multi-omics approach. We fermented two sorghum arabinoxylans (SAXs) as model complex polysaccharides, with fecal microbiota from three donors and an artificially high diversity mix of all three. Although differences in sugar linkage profiles across SAXs were subtle, surprisingly, consortia fermenting different AXs revealed distinct species-level genomic diversity and metabolic outcomes with nearly-identical strains on each polysaccharide across inocula. Carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) genes in metagenomes revealed broad AX-related hydrolytic potentials; however, CAZyme genes enriched in different AX-fermenting consortia were specific to SAX type and displayed various catabolic domain fusions with diverse accessory motifs, suggesting they may be functionally degenerate and this degeneracy may relate to fine substrate structure. These results suggest that fine polysaccharide structure exerts deterministic selection effect for distinct fermenting consortia, which are present amongst unrelated individuals.",

    "abstract": "Autophagy is a conserved and essential cellular degradation and recycling process that is required to maintain neuronal homeostasis. Genetic and pathological evidence suggest that autophagy is disrupted in Parkinsons disease (PD), a prevalent and progressive neurodegenerative disease, yet how changes in autophagy contribute to disease pathogenesis is unclear. To better understand the cellular impacts of disrupted autophagy on neuronal function, we used unbiased proteomics to compare the cargos degraded by basal autophagy in two different mouse models of PD. We isolated autophagic vesicles from the brains of PINK1 knock-out mice and LRRK2G2019S knock-in mice, and further compared these data to observations from young and old mice. We find evidence for the upregulation of adaptive pathways to remove proteins and organelles in PINK1-/- and LRRK2G2019S mice. In PINK1-/-mouse brain, impaired mitophagy leads to increased expression of components of the autophagic machinery as well as increased expression of selective adaptors for mitochondrial autophagy independent of PINK1/Parkin, including BCL2L13. In LRRK2G2019S mice, we find that the impairments to autophagosome trafficking and acidification lead to increased cargo secretion. We further compared these data sets to proteomic data comparing young and old mice. In aged mice, we find decreased engulfment of lysosomes and increased engulfment of -synuclein, a key component of pathogenic Lewy bodies found in PD. Together, these findings highlight the engagement of distinct compensatory pathways to maintain homeostasis in the brain upon disruption of either stress-induced or basal autophagic pathways, and we begin to identify how age-related changes may place further stress on autophagys ability to maintain homeostasis.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=161 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510717v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18fb2dforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@12861bcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@28bdd5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c71f58_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The mammalian cell nucleus contains dozens of membrane-less nuclear bodies that play significant roles in various aspects of gene expression. Several nuclear bodies are nucleated by specific architectural noncoding RNAs (arcRNAs) acting as structural scaffolds. We have reported that a minor population of cellular RNAs exhibits an unusual semi-extractable feature upon using the conventional procedure of RNA preparation and that needle shearing or heating of cell lysates remarkably improves extraction of dozens of RNAs. Because semi-extractable RNAs, including known arcRNAs, commonly localize in nuclear bodies, this feature may be a hallmark of arcRNAs. Using the semi-extractability of RNA, we performed genome-wide screening of semi-extractable long non-coding RNAs to identify new candidate arcRNAs for arcRNA under hyperosmotic and heat stress conditions. After screening stress-inducible and semi-extractable RNAs, hundreds of readthrough downstream-of-gene (DoG) transcripts over several hundreds of kilobases, many of which were not detected among RNAs prepared by the conventional extraction procedure, were found to be stress-inducible and semi-extractable. We further characterized some of the abundant DoGs and found that stress-inducible transient extension of the 3-UTR made DoGs semi-extractable. Furthermore, they were localized in distinct nuclear foci that were sensitive to 1,6-hexanediol. These data suggest that semi-extractable DoGs exhibit arcRNA-like features and our semi-extractable RNA-seq is a powerful tool to extensively monitor DoGs that are induced under specific physiological conditions.",

TRAP is essential for the secretion of many hormones, and its key role in the production of the hormone peptide insulin has been particularly well established5,6. The mechanism by which TRAP engages ribosomes and the translocon to facilitate translocation of protein clients in the secretory pathway is not clear. Here, we reveal the molecular architecture of the mammalian TRAP complex and how it engages the translating ribosome associated with Sec61 translocon on the ER membrane. The TRAP complex is anchored to the ribosome via a long tether and its position relative to the ribosome and the translocon is further stabilized by a finger-like loop. This spatial arrangement positions a cradle-like lumenal domain of TRAP below the protein conducting pore of the translocon for interactions with translocated nascent chains. The biological importance of these key interactions is evident by structure-guided TRAP mutations in C. elegans that lead to growth deficits associated with increased ER stress and defects in insulin secretion. Our findings elucidate the molecular basis of the TRAP complex in the biogenesis and translocation of proteins at the ER.",

Utilising a simple model organism to study uridylation may facilitate efforts to understand the cellular function of this process. Here we demonstrate that uridylation can be detected using simple bioinformatics approach. We utilise it to unravel widespread transcript uridylation in fission yeast and demonstrate the contribution of both Cid1 and Cid16, the only two annotated terminal uridyltransferases (TUT-ases) in this yeast.\n\nTo detect uridylation in transcriptome data, we used a RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) library preparation protocol involving initial linker ligation to fragmented RNA. We next explored the data to detect uridylation marks. Our analysis shows that uridylation in yeast is pervasive, similarly to the ones in multicellular organisms. Importantly, our results confirm the role of the cytoplasmic uridyltransferase Cid1 as the primary uridylation catalyst. However, we also observed an auxiliary role of the second uridyltransferase, Cid16. Thus both fission yeast uridyltransferases are involved in mRNA uridylation. Intriguingly, we found no physiological phenotype of the single and double deletion mutants of cid1 and cid16 and only limited impact of uridylation on steady-state mRNA levels.\n\nOur work establishes fission yeast as a potent model to study uridylation in a simple eukaryote, and we demonstrate that it is possible to detect uridylation marks in RNA-seq data without the need for specific methodologies.",

    "abstract": "K-Ras4B is one the most frequently mutated proteins in cancer, yet mechanistic details of its activation such as its homodimerization on the membrane remain elusive. The structural determinants of K-Ras4B homodimerization have been debated with different conformations being proposed in the literature. Here, we perform microsecond all-atom Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations on the K-Ras4B monomer in solution, the K-Ras4B monomer on the membrane, and two experimentally-based K-Ras4B dimer models of the 4-5 interface to investigate the stability of these structures bound to GTP on a model cell membrane. We then evaluate the complexes for their propensity to form stable dimers on the plasma membrane in the presence and absence of Raf[RBD-CRD] effectors. We find that Raf[RBD-CRD] effectors enhance dimer stability, suggesting that the presence of effectors is necessary for K-Ras4B dimers stabilization on the cell membrane. Moreover, we observe, for the first time, a dynamic water channel at the K-Ras4B dimer interface, and identify putative allosteric connections in the K-Ras4B dimer interface. To discover novel K-Ras4B interfaces, we perform coarse-grained MD simulations in two dissociated K-Ras4B monomers on the membrane, which reveal that the dominant dimer interface is the 4-5 interface. Finally, a druggability analysis is performed in the different K-Ras4B structures in the monomeric states. Strikingly, all known binding pockets of K-Ras4B are identified only in the structure that is membrane-bound, but not in the solution structure. Based on these results, we propose that modulating the protein-membrane interactions can be an alternative strategy for inhibiting K-Ras4B signaling.",

Over 22,000 insect specimens collected were identified to order or family, and bee specimens were identified to genus or species. We found that overall insect community composition and biodiversity characteristics were similar between the three regions examined. However, the central region had higher taxonomic richness than the southern region. Although unique bee taxa were observed in each region, diversity metrics and community composition of bees were similar among sites. This study provides taxonomic information about the insect, particularly bees, and plant communities in thin-soil environments in this region, which could support conservation and management efforts.",

    "abstract": "Kinetochores connect chromosomes to spindle microtubules to ensure their correct segregation during cell division. Kinetochores of human and yeast are largely homologous, their ability to track depolymerizing microtubules however is carried out by the non-homologous complexes Ska1-C and Dam1-C, respectively. We previously reported the unique anti-correlating phylogenetic profiles of Dam1-C and Ska-C found amongst a wide variety of eukaryotes. Based on these profiles and the limited presence of Dam1-C, we speculated that horizontal gene transfer (HGT) could have played a role in the evolutionary history of Dam1-C.\n\nHere, we present expanded analyses of Dam1-c evolution, using additional genome as well as transcriptome sequences and recently acquired 3D structure data. This analysis revealed a wider and more complete presence of Dam1-C in Cryptista, Rhizaria, Ichthyosporea, CRuMs, and Colponemidia. The fungal Dam1-C cryo-EM structure supports earlier hypothesized intra-complex homologies, which enables the reconstruction of rooted and unrooted phylogenies. The rooted tree of concatenated Dam1-C subunits is statistically consistent with the species tree of eukaryotes, suggesting that Dam1-C is ancient, and that the present-day phylogenetic distribution is best explained by multiple, independent losses and no HGT was involved. Furthermore, we investigated the ancient origin of Dam1-C via profile-profile searches. Homology among eight out of the ten Dam1-C subunits suggested that the complex largely evolved from a single multimerizing subunit that diversified into an octameric core via stepwise duplication and sub-functionalization of the subunits before the origin of the Last Common Ancestor.\n\nSignificanceThe Dam1 complex has a crucial role in cell division yet its distribution across species is very patchy. To resolve the evolutionary origin of this peculiar distribution, we used the recently acquired 3D structure to obtain a rooted phylogeny. This study makes an important step in discovering the evolutionary history of the Dam1 complex, by determining that Dam1-C was part of the Last eukaryotic Common Ancestor and arose via stepwise duplications during the transition from prokaryotes to eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Rapid evolution of similar phenotypes in similar environments, giving rise to in situ parallel adaptation, is an important hallmark of ecological speciation. However, what appears to be in situ adaptation can also arise by dispersal of divergent lineages from elsewhere. We test whether two contrasting phenotypes repeatedly evolved in parallel, or have a single origin, in an archetypal example of ecological adaptive radiation: benthic-limnetic three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) across species-pair and solitary lakes in British Columbia. We identify two genomic clusters across freshwater populations, which differ in benthic-limnetic divergent phenotypic traits and separate benthic from limnetic individuals in species pair lakes. Phylogenetic reconstruction and niche evolution modelling both suggest a single evolutionary origin for each of these clusters. We detected strong phylogenetic signal in benthic-limnetic divergent traits, suggesting they are ancestrally retained. Accounting for ancestral state retention, we identify local adaptation of body armour due to the presence of an intraguild predator, the sculpin (Cottus asper) and environmental effects of lake depth and pH on body size. Taken together, our results imply a predominant role for retention of ancestral characteristics in driving trait distribution, with further selection imposed on some traits by environmental factors.",

Affected dogs frequently presented with vomiting, diarrhoea and inappetence. Data from sentinel diagnostic laboratories showed similar seasonal increases in CECoV diagnosis. Membrane glycoprotein (M) gene sequence analysis implied wide geographical circulation of a new CECoV variant. Whole genome sequencing suggested the main circulating 2022 variant was most closely related to one previously identified in 2020 with additional spike gene recombination; all variants were unrelated to CECoV-like viruses recently associated with human respiratory disease. Identifying factors that drive population-level evolution, and its implications for host protection and virulence, will be important to understand the emerging role of CECoV variants in canine and human health, and may act as a model for coronavirus population adaptation more widely.",

However, their characterization via DNA sequencing suffers from the low abundance of plasmid DNA in those samples. Although sample preparation methods can enrich the proportion of plasmid DNA before sequencing, these methods are expensive and laborious, and they might introduce a bias by enriching only for specific plasmid DNA sequences. Nanopore adaptive sampling could overcome these issues by rejecting uninteresting DNA molecules during the sequencing process. In this study, we assess the application of adaptive sampling for the enrichment of low-abundant plasmids in known bacterial isolates using two different adaptive sampling tools. We show that a significant enrichment can be achieved even on expired flow cells. By applying adaptive sampling, we also improve the quality of de novo plasmid assemblies and reduce the sequencing time. However, our experiments also highlight issues with adaptive sampling if target and non-target sequences span similar regions.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is important for establishing and maintaining cell identity and for genomic stability. This is achieved by regulating the accessibility of regulatory and transcriptional elements and the compaction of subtelomeric, centromeric, and other inactive genomic regions. Carcinogenesis is accompanied by a global loss in DNA methylation, which facilitates the transformation of cells. Cancer hypomethylation may also cause genomic instability, for example through interference with the protective function of telomeres and centromeres. However, understanding the role(s) of hypomethylation in tumor evolution is incomplete because the precise mutational consequences of global hypomethylation have thus far not been systematically assessed. Here we made genome-wide inventories of all possible genetic variation that accumulates in single cells upon the long-term global hypomethylation by CRISPR/CAS9-mediated conditional knockdown of DNMT1. Depletion of DNMT1 results in a genomewide reduction in DNA methylation levels. Hypomethylated cells show reduced proliferation rates, reactivation of the inactive X-chromosome and abnormal nuclear morphologies. Prolonged hypomethylation is accompanied by increased chromosomal instability. However, there is no increase in mutational burden, enrichment for certain mutational signatures or structural changes to the genome. We conclude that the primary consequence of global hypomethylation is chromosomal instability and does not necessarily lead to other small-scale or structural mutational effects.",

    "abstract": "The remarkable elastic properties of polymers are ultimately due to their molecular structure, but the relation between the macroscopic and molecular properties is often difficult to establish, in particular for (bio)polymers that contain hydrogen bonds, which can easily rearrange upon mechanical deformation. Here we show that two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy on polymer films in a miniature stress tester sheds new light on how the hydrogen-bond structure of a polymer is related to its visco-elastic response. We study thermoplastic polyurethane, a block copolymer consisting of hard segments of hydrogen-bonded urethane groups embedded in a soft matrix of polyether chains. The conventional infrared spectrum shows that upon deformation, the number of hydrogen bonds increases, a process that is largely reversible. However, the 2DIR spectrum reveals that the distribution hydrogen-bond strengths becomes slightly narrower after a deformation cycle, due to the disruption of weak hydrogen bonds, an effect that could explain the strain-cycle induced softening (Mullins effect) of polyurethane. These results show how rheo-2DIR spectroscopy can bridge the gap between the molecular structure and the macroscopic elastic properties of (bio)polymers.",

It oxidizes intracellular NADPH to reduce extracellular oxygen to produce superoxide anions for pathogen killing. The resting phagocyte oxidase is a heterodimeric complex formed by two transmembrane proteins NOX2 and p22. Despite the functional importance of this complex, its structure remains elusive. Here we reported the cryo-EM structure of the human NOX2-p22 complex in nanodisc in the resting state. The structure shows that p22 is formed by four transmembrane helices and interacts with NOX2 through its M1 and M4 helices. Hydrophobic residues on M3, M4, and M5 of NOX2 contribute to the complex formation. Structural analysis suggests that the cytosolic factors activate the NOX2-p22 complex by stabilizing the dehydrogenase domain (DH) in a productive docked conformation which is efficient for electron transfer between DH and the transmembrane domain.",

    "abstract": "The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens are serious and ongoing threats to public health. Since chromosome replication is essential to cell growth and pathogenesis, the essential DNA polymerases in bacteria have long been targets of antimicrobial development, although none have yet advanced to the market. Here we use transient-state kinetic methods to characterize the inhibition of the PolC replicative DNA polymerase from Staphylococcus aureus by ME-EMAU, a member of the 6-anilinouracil compounds that specifically target PolC enzymes, which are found in low-GC content Gram-positive bacteria. We find that ME-EMAU binds to S. aureus PolC with a dissociation constant of 14 nM, more than 200-fold tighter than the previously reported inhibition constant, which was determined using steady-state kinetic methods. This tight binding is driven by a very slow off rate, 0.006 s-1. We also characterized the kinetics of nucleotide incorporation by PolC containing a mutation of phenylalanine 1261 to leucine (F1261L). The F1261L mutation decreases ME-EMAU binding affinity by at least 3500-fold, but also decreases the maximal rate of nucleotide incorporation by 11.5-fold. This suggests that bacteria acquiring this mutation would be likely to replicate slowly and be unable to out-compete wild-type strains in the absence of inhibitor, reducing the likelihood of the resistant bacteria propagating and spreading resistance.",

In addition, insertion of SKX, KKX, and AKX (X = G, L, H, Y, E, and F) at the N-terminus increased protein production. Furthermore, insertion of MSKIK just before the SecM arrest peptide (FSTPVWISQAQGIRAGP), which causes translational stalling on mRNA, greatly increased the production of the protein containing the SecM arrest peptide in the E. coli reconstituted cell-free protein synthesis system (PURE system). A similar phenomenon was observed for CmlA leader whose arrest is induced by chloramphenicol.

    "abstract": "S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) is a non-toxic nitric oxide (NO)-donating compound that occurs naturally in the human body. The use of GSNO to deliver exogenous NO for therapeutic and protective applications is limited by the high lability of dissolved GSNO in aqueous formulations. In this paper, we report a host-guest chemistry-based strategy to modulate the GSNO reactivity and the NO release kinetics. Cyclodextrins (CDs) are host molecules that are typically used to encapsulate hydrophobic guest molecules into their hydrophobic cavities. However, we found that CDs form inclusion complexes with GSNO, an extremely hydrophilic molecule with a solubility of over 1 M at physiological pH. More interestingly, the host-guest complexation reduces the decomposition reactivity of GSNO in the order of CD > {gamma}CD > hydroxypropyl {beta}CD. The lifetime of 0.1 M GSNO is increased to up to 15 days in the presence of CDs at 37{degrees}C, which is more than twice the lifetime of free GSNO. Quantum chemistry calculations indicate that GSNO in CD undergoes a conformational change that significantly reduces the S-NO bond distance and increases its stability. The calculated S-NO bond dissociation enthalpies of free and complexed GSNO well agree with the experimentally observed GSNO decomposition kinetics. The NO release from GSNO-CD solutions, compared to GSNO solutions, has suppressed initial bursts and extended durations, enhancing the safety and efficacy of NO-based therapies and device protections. In an example application as an anti-infective lock solution for intravascular catheters, the GSNO-CD solution exhibits potent antibacterial activities for both planktonic and biofilm bacteria, both intraluminal and extraluminal environments, both prevention and treatment of infections, and against multiple bacterial strains including a multidrug-resistant strain. In addition to solutions, the inclusion complexation also enables the preparation of GSNO hydrogels with enhanced stability and improved antibacterial efficacy. Since methods to suppress and control the GSNO decomposition rate are rare, this supramolecular strategy provides new opportunities for the formulation and application of this natural NO donor.",

Dynamic post-translational modifications are very challenging to structurally characterize using modern techniques, including covalent labeling methods, due to the presence of multiple proteoforms and conformers together in solution. Here, we have coupled ion exchange HPLC with a flash oxidation system (IEX LC-FOX) to successfully elucidate structural changes among three phosphoproteoforms of ovalbumin (OVA) during dephosphorylation with alkaline phosphatase (AP). Real-time dosimetry indicates no difference in effective radical dose between peaks or across the peak, demonstrating both the lack of scavenging of the NaCl gradient and the lack of a concentration effect on radical dose between peaks of different intensities. The use of IEX LC-FOX allows us to structurally probe each phosphoproteoform as it elutes from the column, capturing structural data before the dynamics of the system reintroduce heterogeneity. We found significant differences in residue-level oxidation between the hydroxyl radical footprint of non-phosphorylated, mono-phosphorylated and di-phosphorylated ovalbumin. Not only were our data consistent with the previously reported stabilization of ovalbumin structure by phosphorylation, but local structural changes were also consistent with the measured order of dephosphorylation of Ser344 being removed first. These results demonstrate the utility of IEX LC-FOX for measuring the structural effects of PTMs, even in dynamic systems.",

Changes in intracellular crowding effects have been mostly ascribed to differences in biomacromolecule concentration. However, the spatial organization of these molecules should play a significant role in crowding effects. Here, we find that cell wall damage causes increased macromolecular crowding effects in the Escherichia coli cytoplasm. Using a genetically-encoded macromolecular crowding sensor, we see that crowding effects in E. coli spheroplasts and Penicillin G-treated cells well surpass crowding effects obtained using hyperosmotic stress. The crowding increase is not due to osmotic pressure, cell shape, crowder synthesis, or volume changes, and therefore not crowder concentration. Instead, a genetically-encoded nucleic acid stain and a small molecule DNA stain show nucleoid expansion and cytoplasmic mixing, which could cause these increased crowding effects. Our data demonstrate that cell stress from antibiotics or cell wall damage alters the biochemical organization in the cytoplasm and induces significant conformational changes in a probe protein.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobes play a role in fundamental ecological, chemical, and physiological processes of their host. Host life-history traits from defence to growth are therefore determined not only by abiotic environment and genotype but also by microbiota composition. However, the relative importance and interactive effects of these factors may vary between organisms. Such connections remain particularly elusive in Lepidoptera, which have been argued to lack a permanent microbiome and have microbiota primarily determined by their diet and environment.\n\nWe tested the microbiome specificity and its influence on life-history traits of two colour genotypes of the wood tiger moth (Arctia plantaginis) that differ in several traits, including growth. All individuals were grown in the laboratory for several generations with standardised conditions. We analysed the bacterial community of the genotypes before and after a reciprocal frass (i.e., larval faeces) transplantation and followed growth rate, pupal mass, and the production of defensive secretion.\n\nResultsAfter transplantation, the fast-growing genotype grew at a significantly slower rate compared to the controls, but the slow-growing genotype did not change its growth rate. The frass transplant also increased the volume of defensive secretions in the fast-growing genotype but did not affect pupal mass. Overall, the fast-growing genotype appeared more susceptible to the transplantation than the slow-growing genotype.\n\nMicrobiome differences between the genotypes strongly suggest genotype-based selective filtering of bacteria from the diet and environment. A novel cluster of insect-associated Erysipelotrichaceae was exclusive to the fast-growing genotype, and specific Enterococcaceae were characteristic to the slow-growing genotype. These Enterococcaceae became more prevalent in the fast-growing genotype after the transplant, which suggests that the slower growth rate was potentially related to their presence.\n\nConclusionsWe show that some genotype-specific life-history traits in a lepidopteran host can be reversed by a reciprocal frass transplantation. The results indicate that genotype-specific selective filtering can fine-tune the bacterial community at specific life stages, particularly the larval gut, even against a background of a highly variable community with stochastic assembly. Altogether, our findings suggest that the genotype of the host can influence its susceptibility to be colonized by microbiota with impact on key life-history traits.",

    "abstract": "Cell type-specific transcriptional differences between brain tissues from donors with Alzheimers disease (AD) and unaffected controls have been well-documented, but few studies have rigorously interrogated the regulatory mechanisms responsible for these alterations. We performed single nucleus multiomics (snRNA-seq+snATAC-seq) on 105,332 nuclei isolated from cortical tissues from 7 AD and 8 unaffected donors to identify candidate cis-regulatory elements (CREs) involved in AD-associated transcriptional changes. We detected 319,861 significant correlations, or links, between gene expression and cell type-specific transposase accessible regions enriched for active CREs. Among these, 40,831 were unique to AD tissues. Validation experiments confirmed the activity of many regions, including several candidate regulators of APP expression. We identified ZEB1 and MAFB as candidate transcription factors playing important roles in AD-specific gene regulation in neurons and microglia, respectively. Microglial links were globally enriched for heritability of AD risk and previously identified active regulatory regions.",

    "abstract": "Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) fragments are a biological analyte with extensive utility in diagnostic medicine. Understanding the source of cfDNA and mechanisms of release is crucial for designing and interpreting cfDNA-based liquid biopsy assays. Using cell type-specific methylation markers as well as genome-wide methylation analysis, we determined that megakaryocytes, the precursors of anuclear platelets, are major contributors to cfDNA ([~]26%), while erythroblasts contribute 1-4% of cfDNA in healthy individuals. Surprisingly, we discovered that platelets contain genomic DNA fragments originating in megakaryocytes, contrary to the general understanding that platelets lack genomic DNA. Megakaryocyte-derived cfDNA is increased in pathologies involving increased platelet production (Essential Thrombocythemia, Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura) and decreased upon reduced platelet production due to chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression. Similarly, erythroblast cfDNA is reflective of erythrocyte production and is elevated in patients with Thalassemia. Megakaryocyte- and erythroblast-specific DNA methylation patterns can thus serve as novel biomarkers for pathologies involving increased or decreased thrombopoiesis and erythropoiesis, which can aid in determining the etiology of aberrant levels of erythrocytes and platelets.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510502v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (35K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@164e8borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7eb5e1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d6ff73org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11cf846_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "As population genomics is transitioning from single reference genomes to pangenomes, major improvements in terms of genome contiguity, phylogenetic sampling, haplotype phasing and structural variant (SV) calling are required. Here, we generated the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Reference Assembly Panel (ScRAP) comprising 142 reference-quality genomes from strains of various geographic and ecological origins that faithfully represent the genomic diversity and complexity of the species. The ca. 4,800 non-redundant SVs we identified impact the expression of genes near the breakpoints and contribute to gene repertoire evolution through disruptions, duplications, fusions and horizontal transfers. We discovered frequent cases of complex aneuploidies, preferentially involving large chromosomes that underwent large SVs. We also characterized the evolutionary dynamics of complex genomic regions that classically remain unassembled in short read-based projects, including the 5 Ty families and the 32 individual telomeres. Overall, the ScRAP represents a crucial step towards establishing a high-quality, unified and complete S. cerevisiae pangenome.",
