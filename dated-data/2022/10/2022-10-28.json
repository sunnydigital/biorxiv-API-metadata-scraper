    "abstract": "Self-assortation of progenitor cells during development is essential for establishment of distinct tissue identity. This is exemplified in the eye, where the early optic cup is divided into the neural retina (NR) in the center and the ciliary margin (CM) in the periphery. Previous studies have demonstrated that Wnt signaling is required for specification of the CM, but here we show that genetic ablation of Wnt signaling mediator {beta}-catenin in the peripheral optic cup failed to prevent the formation of the CM-derived ciliary body and iris in adult animals. Mosaic analysis revealed that this was only partially due to loss of adherens junctions among {beta}-catenin deficient cells, which were preferentially excluded from the CM. Even in {beta}-catenin mutant cells that can maintain adherens junctions, their inability to mediate Wnt signaling resulted in a change from P-cadherin to N-cadherin expression. We showed that this cadherin switch was sufficient to segregate otherwise identical cells into separate clusters. As a result, the ciliary body and iris were still formed after inactivation of Wnt signaling in the peripheral retina. These results showed that the dual functions of {beta}-catenin in adherens junction and Wnt signaling are required for the passive cell competition to constitute retinal compartments.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses an ever-increasing challenge to the treatment of infections. AMR mechanisms are commonly associated with AMR genes that are carried on mobile elements, such as plasmids that can move between bacterial lineages. Here we introduce an approach that allows us to reconstruct how plasmids move between bacterial lineages. To do so, we model the co-evolution of chromosomal and plasmid DNA in a Bayesian phylogenetic network approach using a joint coalescent and plasmid transfer process. We apply this new approach to a five-year dataset of Shigella isolates from Melbourne, Australia. Doing so, we reconstruct the gain and loss of small plasmids, and the recent dissemination of a multidrug-resistance plasmid between S. sonnei and S. flexneri lineages in multiple independent events and through steady growth in the prevalence since 2010. This approach has a strong potential to improve our understanding of where AMR-carrying plasmids are introduced and maintained.",

    "abstract": "Microbial plankton play a central role in marine biogeochemical cycles, but the timing in which abundant lineages diversified into ocean environments remains unclear. Here, we reconstructed the timeline in which major clades of bacteria and archaea colonized the ocean using a high-resolution benchmarked phylogenetic tree that allows for simultaneous and direct comparison of the ages of multiple divergent lineages. Our findings show that the diversification of the most prevalent marine clades spans throughout a period of 2.2 Ga, with most clades colonizing the ocean during the last 800 million years. The oldest clades - SAR202, SAR324, Ca. Marinimicrobia, and Marine Group II - diversified around the time of the Great Oxidation Event (GOE), during which oxygen concentration increased but remained at microaerophilic levels throughout the Mid-Proterozoic, consistent with the prevalence of some clades within these groups in oxygen minimum zones today. We found the diversification of the prevalent heterotrophic marine clades SAR11, SAR116, SAR92, SAR86, and Roseobacter as well as the Marine Group I, to occur near to the Neoproterozoic Oxygenation Event (0.8-0.4 Ga). The diversification of these clades is concomitant with an overall increase of oxygen and nutrients in the ocean at this time, as well as the diversification of eukaryotic algae, consistent with the previous hypothesis that the diversification of heterotrophic bacteria is linked to the emergence of large eukaryotic phytoplankton. The youngest clades correspond to the widespread phototrophic clades Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus, and Crocosphaera, whose diversification happened after the Phanerozoic Oxidation Event (0.45-0.4 Ga), in which oxygen concentrations had already reached their modern levels in the atmosphere and the ocean. Our work clarifies the timing at which abundant lineages of bacteria and archaea colonized the ocean, thereby providing key insights into the evolutionary history of lineages that comprise the majority of prokaryotic biomass in the modern ocean.",

    "abstract": "The asymmetric increase in average nighttime temperatures relative to increase in average daytime temperatures due to climate change is decreasing grain yield and quality in rice. Therefore, a better understanding of the impact of higher night temperature on single grain at whole genome level is essential for future development of more resilient rice. We investigated the utility of metabolites obtained from grains to classify high night temperature conditions of genotypes, and metabolites and single nucleotide polymorphisms to predict grain length, width, and perimeter phenotypes using a rice diversity panel. We found that the metabolic profiles of rice genotypes alone could be used to classify control and high night temperature conditions with high accuracy using random forest or extreme gradient boosting. The best linear unbiased prediction and BayesC showed greater metabolic prediction performance than machine learning models for grain-size phenotypes. Metabolic prediction was most effective for grain width, resulting in the highest prediction performance. Genomic prediction performed better than metabolic prediction. Integrating metabolites and genomics simultaneously in a prediction model slightly improved prediction performance. We did not observe a difference in prediction between the control and high night temperature conditions. Several metabolites were identified as auxiliary phenotypes that could be used to enhance the multi-trait genomic prediction of grain-size phenotypes. Our results showed that, in addition to single nucleotide polymorphisms, metabolites collected from grains offer rich information to perform predictive analyses, including classification modeling of high night temperature responses and regression modeling of grain size-related phenotypes in rice.",

    "abstract": "Genomic researchers are increasingly utilizing commercial cloud platforms (CCPs) to manage their data and analytics needs. Commercial clouds allow researchers to grow their storage and analytics capacity on demand, keeping pace with expanding project data footprints and enabling researchers to avoid large capital expenditures while paying only for IT capacity consumed by their project. Cloud computing also allows researchers to overcome common network and storage bottlenecks encountered when combining or re-analysing large datasets. However, cloud computing presents a new set of challenges. Without adequate security controls, the risk of unauthorised access may be higher for data stored on the cloud. In addition, regulators are increasingly mandating data access patterns and specific security protocols on the storage and use of genomic data to safeguard rights of the study participants. While CCPs provide tools for security and regulatory compliance, utilising these tools to build the necessary controls required for cloud solutions is not trivial as such skill sets are not commonly found in a genomics lab. The Research Assets Provisioning and Tracking Online Repository (RAPTOR) by the Genome Institute of Singapore is a cloud native genomics data repository and analytics platform focusing on security and regulatory compliance. Using a \"five-safes\" framework (Safe Purpose, Safe People, Safe Settings, Safe Data and Safe Output), RAPTOR provides security and governance controls to data contributors and users leveraging cloud computing for sharing and analysis of large genomic datasets without the risk of security breaches or running afoul of regulations. RAPTOR can also enable data federation with other genomic data repositories using GA4GH community-defined standards, allowing researchers to boost the statistical power of their work and overcome geographic and ancestry limitations of data sets",

    "abstract": "Glucose and glutamine are major carbon and energy sources that promote the fast proliferation of cancer cells. Metabolic shifs observed on cell line or mouse models may not reflect the general metabolic shifts in real human cancer tissue. In this study, we conducted a computational characterization of the flux distribution and variations of the central energy metabolism and key branches in a pan-cancer analysis, including glycolytic pathway, production of lactate, TCA cycle, nucleic acids synthesis, glutaminolysis, glutaminate, glutamine and glutathione metabolism, amino acids synthesis, in 11 cancer subtypes and 9 matched adjacent normal tissue types, by using TCGA tissue transcriptomics data. Our analysis confirms the increased influx in glucose uptake and glycolysis and decreased upper part of TCA cycle, i.e., Warbug effect in the analyzed cancer types. However, consistently increased lactate production and second half of TCA cycle were only seen in certain cancer types. More interestingly, we did not see cancer tissues have highly shifted glutaminolysis compared to their adjacent normal controls. A systems biology model of metabolic shifts in through cancer and tissue types is further developed and analyzed. We observed that (1) normal tissues have distinct metabolic phenotypes, (2) cancer types have drastically different metabolic shifts compared to their adjacent normal controls, and (3) the different shifts happened to tissue specific metabolic phenotypes result in a converged metabolic phenotype through cancer types and cancer progression. This study strongly suggests the possibility to have a unified framework for studies of cancer-inducing stressors, adaptive metabolic reprogramming, and cancerous behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The long-distance communication between multiple cis-regulatory elements (CREs), the self-limiting size and lifetime of regulatory condensates, are two puzzling phenomena in biology. To reconcile these puzzles, we introduce the concept of higher-order catalysis into chromatin-mediated reactions. Essentially, multi-way contact between the CREs defines a transition state that is required for the downstream cascade of chemical reactions. The entropic penalty of chromatin reorganization sets a high activation barrier to enter this transition state. Phase separation of trans-acting agents induced by the CREs reduces this barrier and stabilizes the transition state via forming a regulatory condensate. The downstream reaction then pays back energy to dissolve the condensate and resets the agents to a metastable single-phase state. Accelerating the reactions without consuming agents or changing their state, the cycled phase transitions construct a higher-order catalyst or super-enzyme that is beyond the form of a single molecule. We discuss how chromatin employs such super-enzymes to catalyze higher-order reactions mediated by itself.",

The precise nature of optimal partitioning and how this emerges from cellular dynamics including insurmountable trade-offs remains an open question. We construct a mathematical framework to estimate optimal partitioning and the corresponding maximal growth rate constrained by empirical scaling laws. We model a biosynthesis tradeoff governing the partitioning of the ribosome economy between replicating functional proteins and replicating the ribosome pool, and also an energy tradeoff arising from the finite energy budget of the cell. Through exact analytic calculations we predict limits on the range of values partitioning ratios take while sustaining growth. We calculate how partitioning and cellular composition scale with protein and ribosome degradation rates and organism size. These results reveal different classes of optimizing strategies corresponding to phenotypically distinct bacterial lifestyles. We summarize these findings in a quadrant-based taxonomy including: a \"greedy\" strategy maximally prioritizing growth, a \"prudent\" strategy maximally prioritizing the management of damaged pools, and \"strategically limited\" intermediates.",

We have previously reported loss of long-range co-expression for breast, lung, and kidney cancer GCNs. Here, we extend the study to fifteen tissues. Unlike in healthy phenotypes, the highest cancer gene-pair interactions are intra-chromosomal and their strength decays with base-pair distance. Communities in tumor GCNs are strongly associated with cancer related processes along with a wide presence of adaptive immune response. Riboproteins are highly co-expressed in cancer and normal GCNs, suggesting their relevance for cell viability.

Plants were grown in the in vitro Root-TRAPR system and treated with colloidal chitin and chitosan. Plant morphology was monitored, then plant tissues and exudates were collected for enzymatic activity assays, phytohormone quantification, qPCR analysis and proteomics profiling. Chitosan treatments showed increased total chitinase activity and expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes by 3-5 times in the root tissues. In the exudates, total peroxidase and chitinase activities and levels of defense proteins such as PR protein 1 and endochitinase 2 were increased. Shoot development was unaffected, but root development was inhibited after chitosan exposure. No significant effects on plant defense were observed upon chitin treatment. These results indicate that colloidal chitosan significantly promoted production and secretion of plant defense proteins in C. sativa root system and could be used as a potential elicitor, particularly in hydroponic scenarios to manage crop diseases.\n\nHighlightChitosan induces defense protein productions and secretions in the root tissues and exudates of C. sativa, offering a potential pathway to enhance plant resistance against fungal attack.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMalaria transmission and endemicity in Africa remains hugely disproportionate compared to the rest of the world. The complex life cycle of P. falciparum (Pf) between the vertebrate human host and the anopheline vector results in differential expression of genes within and between hosts. An in-depth understanding of Pf interaction with various human genes through regulatory elements will pave way for identification of additional tool in the arsenal for malaria control. Therefore, the regulatory elements (REs) involved in the over- or under-expression of various host immune genes hold a key to alternative control measures that can be applied for prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\nMethodsWe carried out an RNAseq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes and network analysis of non-coding RNAs and target genes associated with immune response in individuals with different clinical outcomes. Raw RNAseq datasets, retrieved for analyses include individuals with severe (Gambia - 20), symptomatic (Burkina Faso - 15), asymptomatic (Mali - 16) malaria as well as uninfected controls (Tanzania - 20; Mali - 36).\n\nResultsOf the total 107 datasets retrieved, we identified 5534 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among disease and control groups. A peculiar pattern of DEGs was observed, with individuals presenting with severe/symptomatic malaria having the highest and most diverse upregulated genes, while a reverse phenomenon was recorded among the asymptomatic and uninfected individuals. In addition, we identified 141 differentially expressed (DE) miRNA, of which 78 and 63 were upregulated and downregulated respectively. Interactome analysis revealed a moderate interaction between DEGs and miRNAs. Of all identified miRNA, five were unique (hsa-mir-32, hsa-mir-25, hsa-mir-221, hsa-mir-29 and hsa-mir-148) because of their connectivity to several genes, including hsa-mir-221 connected to 16 genes. Six-hundred and eight DE lncRNA were identified, including SLC7A11, LINC01524 among the upregulated ones.\n\nConclusionOur study provides important insights into host immune genes undergoing differential expression under different malaria conditions. It also identified unique miRNAs and lncRNAs that modify and/or regulate the expression of various immune genes. These regulatory elements, we surmise have the potential to serve a diagnostic purpose in discriminating between individuals with severe/symptomatic malaria and those with asymptomatic infection or uninfected.",

    "abstract": "One of the major challenges for the bioremediation application of microbial N2O reduction is its oxygen sensitivity. While a few strains were reported capable of reducing N2O under aerobic conditions, the N2O reduction kinetics of phylogenetically diverse N2O reducers are not well understood. Here we analyzed and compared the kinetics of Clade I and Clade II N2O-reducing bacteria in the presence or absence of O2 by using a whole-cell assay with N2O and O2 microsensors. Among the seven strains tested, N2O reduction of Stutzerimonas stutzeri TR2 and ZoBell were not inhibited by oxygen (i.e., oxygen tolerant). Paracoccus denitrificans, Azospirillum brasilense, and Gemmatimonas aurantiaca reduced N2O in the presence of O2 but slower than in the absence of O2 (i.e., oxygen sensitive). N2O reduction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Dechloromonas aromatica did not occur when O2 was present (i.e., oxygen intolerant). Amino acid sequences and predicted structures of NosZ were highly similar among these strains, whereas oxygen-tolerant N2O reducers had higher oxygen consumption rates. The results suggest that the mechanism of O2 tolerance is not directly related to NosZ structure but rather related to the scavenging of O2 in the cells and/or accessory proteins encoded by the nos cluster.\n\nIMPORTANCESome bacteria can reduce N2O in the presence of O2, whereas others cannot. It is unclear whether this trait of aerobic N2O reduction is related to the phylogeny and structure of N2O reductase. The understanding of aerobic N2O reduction is critical in guiding emission control, due to the common concurrence of N2O and O2 in natural and engineered systems. This study provided the N2O reduction kinetics of various bacteria under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and classified the bacteria into oxygen-tolerant, -sensitive, and -intolerant N2O reducers. Oxygen-tolerant N2O reducers rapidly consumed O2, which could help maintain the low O2 concentration in the cells and keep their N2O reductase active. These findings are important and useful when selecting N2O reducers for bioremediation applications.",

    "abstract": "Decidualization is a differentiation process involving shape reorganization from a fibroblast to an epithelioid-like appearance of endometrial stromal cells. Specificities of these cells impede the use of existing automated tools to follow morphological changes during differentiation; we therefore developed a simple but accurate methodology to quantify the phenotypical changes that occur in an in vitro decidualization system.\n\nThe approach consists of the analysis of the circularity of the cells directly from light microscopy images. Here, we used this methodology to follow the effects of progesterone or progestin R5020 in combination with estradiol (E2) and cAMP on inducing the decidualization of human endometrial cells. We further implemented a statistical model to detect the differences in the kinetics of decidualization of the two hormonal stimuli before all the cell population acquired the decidual phenotype. We found that 2 days after stimulation are sufficient to detect statistical differences in morphology between decidualization induced and control cells. Here, we detail the model and scripts in order to provide a useful, practical and low cost tool to evaluate morphological aspects of endometrial stromal differentiation.\n\nAvailability and implementationSee supplementary methods\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data is available online.",

    "abstract": "Overreliance on habit is linked with disorders such as drug addiction and obsessive-compulsive disorder and there is increasing interest in the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to alter neuronal activity in the relevant pathways and reduce relapse or accelerated shift towards habit formation. Here we studied the brains of ephrin-A2A5-/- mice, which previously showed perseverative behaviour in progressive-ratio tasks, associated with low cellular activity in nucleus accumbens. We investigated if rTMS treatment had altered the hierarchical recruitment of brain regions from ventral to dorsal striatum associated with abnormal habit formation in these mice.\n\nBrain sections of mice that underwent progressive-ratio tasks with and without low intensity rTMS (LI-rTMS) were taken from a previous study. We take advantage of the previous characterisation of perseverative behaviour to investigate the contribution of different neuronal subtypes and striatal regions. Striatal regions were stained for neuronal activation with c-Fos and for medium spiny neurons with DARPP32. Qualitative analysis was carried out for other neuronal subtypes in the striatum - GABAergic, parvalbumin-expressing and cholinergic interneurons.\n\nContrary to our hypothesis, we found neuronal activity in ephrin-A2A5-/- mice still reflected goal-directed behaviour. However, we saw that the dorsolateral striatum contributed more to total striatal activity in untreated ephrin-A2/A5-/- mice. This supported our hypothesis that ephrin-A2/A5-/- mice have greater c-Fos activity in habit-associated striatal regions. LI-rTMS in ephrin-A2A5-/- mice also appeared to delay the shift from goal-directed to habitual behaviour as suggested by increased activation in dorsomedial striatum and nucleus accumbens.",

    "abstract": "Most people sample addictive drugs, but use becomes disordered in only a small minority. Two important factors that influence susceptibility to addiction are individual differences in personality traits and biological sex. The influence of traits on addiction-like behaviour is well characterized in preclinical models of cocaine self-administration, but less is understood in regards to opioids. How biological sex influences trait susceptibility to opioid self-administration is likewise less studied than psychostimulants. Thus, we sought to elucidate how biological sex and several addiction-relevant traits interact with the propensity to self-administer the opioid remifentanil. We first screened female (n=19) and male (n=19) rats for four addiction-relevant traits: impulsivity, novelty place-preference, anxiety-like behaviour, and attribution of incentive value to reward cues. Rats were then trained to self-administer remifentanil in a \"conflict model\" of drug self-administration. Rats had to endure a mild electric shock to access the response manipulandum that triggered an intravenous infusion of remifentanil. In male rats, high anxiety-like behaviour was positively correlated with the number of drug infusions if the shock level was low or completely absent. In females, sign-tracking was predictive of greater resistance to punishment during drug seeking; an effect that was mediated by anxiety-like behaviour. Females consumed more remifentanil under all conditions, and their drug seeking persisted in the face of significantly greater current than males. These findings demonstrate that the influence of behavioural traits over the propensity to self-administer opioids is dependent upon biological sex.",

    "abstract": "Voluntary movements are prepared before they are executed. Preparatory activity has been observed across the CNS and recently documented in first order neurons of the human PNS i.e., in muscle spindles. The changes seen in these sensory organs suggest that the independent modulation of stretch reflex gains may represent an important component of movement preparation. The aim of the current study was to further investigate the preparatory modulation of short- and long-latency stretch reflex responses ( SLR and  LLR) of the dominant upper limb. Specifically, we investigated how different target parameters (target distance and direction) affect the preparatory tuning of stretch reflex gains in the context of goal-directed reaching, and whether any such tuning depends on preparation duration and the direction of background loads. We found that target distance produced only small variations in reflex gains. In contrast, both SLR and LLR gains were strongly modulated as a function of target direction, in a manner that facilitated the upcoming voluntary movement. This goal-directed tuning of SLR and LLR gains was present or enhanced when the preparatory delay was sufficiently long (>250 ms) and the homonymous muscle was unloaded i.e., when a background load was first applied in the direction of homonymous muscle action (assistive loading). The results extend further support for a relatively slow-evolving process in reach preparation that functions to modulate reflexive muscle stiffness, likely via the independent control of fusimotor neurons. Such control can augment voluntary goal-directed movement and is triggered or enhanced when the homonymous muscle is unloaded.\n\nSignificance StatementIt is well-known that movement preparation improves motor performance. That is, briefly delaying the onset of a goal-directed movement can significantly benefit the overall quality of movement. However, the mechanisms underlying movement preparation remain unclear. In this study we examined the preparatory modulation of short- and long-latency stretch reflex responses in the dominant upper limb. We found that goal-directed tuning of stretch reflex gains is consistently triggered or enhanced in cases where preparation is sufficiently long (>250 ms) and a background - assistive- load is first applied in the direction of homonymous muscle action. A better understanding of movement preparation will likely also benefit the development of rehabilitation regimes and movement augmentation devices.",

    "abstract": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) is a key modulator of excitatory synaptic transmission, gene expression, learning and memory. Mutations in the CAMK2A gene, which encodes CaMKII and is highly expressed in multiple regions in the forebrain, have been recently linked to neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID). Our lab generated and characterized a knock-in (KI) mutant mouse with a glutamate-183 to valine (E183V) CaMKII mutation detected in several children diagnosed with ASD or ID. The E183V mutation reduces CaMKII activity and expression levels but the contributions of these two changes to the ASD-related behavioral phenotypes of these mice are unclear. Therefore, we performed side-by-side comparisons of the behavioral phenotypes of CaMKII E183V-KI mice with two other mutant mouse lines with either a complete loss of CaMKII expression (CaMKII Null mice) or reduced kinase activity (due to a threonine-286 to alanine mutation that abrogates autophosphorylation at this site) with no significant change in expression levels (CaMKII T286A-KI mice). In all three lines, homozygous mutant mice displayed increased stereotypic jumping behavior and hyperactivity, without alterations in anxiety or social interactions. Interestingly, homozygous mutant mice in all three lines also displayed a substantial reduction in tactile sensitivity using the Von Frey filament test. Together, these data suggest that reductions of either CaMKII expression or activity in mice disrupted normal motor and sensory functions.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the SNCA gene cause autosomal dominant Parkinsons disease (PD), with progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, and accumulation of aggregates of -synuclein. However, the sequence of molecular events that proceed from the SNCA mutation during development, to its end stage pathology is unknown. Utilising human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) with SNCA mutations, we resolved the temporal sequence of pathophysiological events that occur during neuronal differentiation in order to discover the early, and likely causative, events in synucleinopathies. We adapted a small molecule-based protocol that generates highly enriched midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons (>80%). We characterised their molecular identity using single-cell RNA sequencing and their functional identity through the synthesis and secretion of dopamine, the ability to generate action potentials, and form functional synapses and networks. RNA velocity analyses confirmed the developmental transcriptomic trajectory of midbrain neural precursors into mDA neurons using our approach, and identified key driver genes in mDA neuronal development. To characterise the synucleinopathy, we adopted super-resolution methods to determine the number, size and structure of aggregates in SNCA-mutant mDA neurons. At one week of differentiation, prior to maturation to mDA neurons of molecular and functional identity, we demonstrate the formation of small aggregates; specifically, {beta}-sheet rich oligomeric aggregates, in SNCA-mutant midbrain immature neurons. The aggregation progresses over time to accumulate phosphorylated aggregates, and later fibrillar aggregates. When the midbrain neurons were functional, we observed evidence of impaired physiological calcium signalling, with raised basal calcium, and impairments in cytosolic and mitochondrial calcium efflux. Once midbrain identity fully developed, SNCA-mutant neurons exhibited bioenergetic impairments, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. During the maturation of mDA neurons, upregulation of mitophagy and autophagy occured, and ultimately these multiple cellular stresses lead to an increase in cell death by six weeks post-differentiation. Our differentiation paradigm generates an efficient model for studying disease mechanisms in PD, and highlights that protein misfolding to generate intraneuronal oligomers is one of the earliest critical events driving disease in human neurons, rather than a late-stage hallmark of the disease.",

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of either pediatric obsessive-compulsive traits, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), have identified loci near Ptprd as genome-wide significant, or strongly suggestive for this trait. We assessed Ptprd wild-type (WT), heterozygous (HT), and knockout (KO) mice for behavioral dimensions that are altered in OCD, including anxiety and exploration (open field test, dig test), perseverative behavior (splash-induced grooming, spatial d), sensorimotor gating (prepulse inhibition), and home cage goal-directed behavior (nest building). No effect of genotype was observed in any measure of the open field test, dig test, or splash test. However, Ptprd KO mice of both sexes showed impairments in nest building behavior. Finally, female, but not male, Ptprd KO mice showed deficits in prepulse inhibition, an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that is reduced in female, but not male, OCD patients.

    "abstract": "GDAP1 (Ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1) is a novel member of the GST superfamily of detoxifying enzymes that is anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane. GDAP1 mutations and changes in expression levels result in the inherited neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, types 2K, 4A and 4H. GDAP1 activity has been associated with many mitochondrial functions however direct molecular interactions underpinning these connections have remained elusive. Here we establish that GDAP1 can bind 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE), a toxic end-product of lipid peroxidation. 4HNE binding requires the -loop, a large sequence motif that is inserted within the substrate recognition domain and is unique to GDAP1. In human cells, GDAP1 overexpression plays a cytoprotective role against oxidative stress. This effect is lost upon deletion of the -loop. Lastly, we demonstrate that a CMT-causing mutant that destabilizes -loop positioning also results in a decrease in 4HNE binding affinity. Together these results establish 4HNE as the biological ligand for GDAP1, provide mechanistic insight into 4HNE binding, and demonstrate that altered 4HNE recognition is the likely mechanism underlying CMT-causing mutants such as T157P near the 4HNE binding site.",

Leveraging the great advances in light-based biofabrication, we herein introduce a hybrid strategy to tackle this challenge. By combining volumetric printing (VP) and high-resolution two-photon ablation (2PA), we demonstrate the possibility to create complex multiscale organotypic perfusable models with features ranging from mesoscale (VP) to microscale (2PA). To successfully combine these two methods, we first eliminated micrometer-size defects generated during VP process. Due to optical modulation instability of the laser source and selffocusing phenomenon that occurs when the light triggers the photoresin crosslinking, VP printed constructs feature micrometer-size filaments and channels. By optical tuning the refractive index of the photoresin, we demonstrate defect-free VP that can then be combined with 2PA. To facilitate the 2PA process and meet VP requirements, we introduce a purely protein-based photoclick photoresin combining gelatin-norbornene and gelatin-thiol. By optimizing defect-free VP and 2PA processes, we finally demonstrate the possibility to generate complex 3D vasculature-like constructs with features ranging from ~400 m of VP to ~2 m of 2PA. This hybrid strategy opens new possibilities to better recapitulate microtissues vasculature and complex architectures, with particular potential for microfluidics and organ/tissue-on-a-chip technologies.",

    "abstract": "Deep learning (DL) shows notable success in biomedical studies. However, most DL algorithms work as a black box, exclude biomedical experts, and need extensive data. We introduce the Self-Enhancing Multi-Photon Artificial Intelligence (SEMPAI), that integrates hypothesis-driven priors in a data-driven DL approach for research on multiphoton microscopy (MPM) of muscle fibers. SEMPAI utilizes meta-learning to optimize prior integration, data representation, and neural network architecture simultaneously. This allows hypothesis testing and provides interpretable feedback about the origin of biological information in MPM images. SEMPAI performs joint learning of several tasks to enable prediction for small datasets.\n\nThe method is applied on an extensive multi-study dataset resulting in the largest joint analysis of pathologies and function for single muscle fibers. SEMPAI outperforms state-of-the-art biomarkers in six of seven predictive tasks, including those with scarce data. SEMPAIs DL models with integrated priors are superior to those without priors and to prior-only machine learning approaches.",

    "abstract": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are non-polyadenylated RNAs with a continuous loop structure characterized by a non-co-linear back-splice junction (BSJ). While dozens of computational tools have been developed and identified millions of circRNA candidates in diverse species, it remains a major challenge for determining circRNA reliability due to various types of false positives. Here, we systematically assess the impacts of numerous factors related to identification, conservation, biogenesis, and function on circRNA reliability by comparisons of circRNA expression from mock (total RNAs) and the corresponding co-linear/polyadenylated RNA-depleted datasets based on three different RNA treatment approaches. Eight important indicators of circRNA reliability are determined. The relative contribution to variability explained analyses further reveal that the relative importance of these factors in affecting circRNA reliability is conservation level of circRNA > full-length circular sequences > supporting BSJ read count > both BSJ donor and acceptor splice sites at the same co-linear transcript isoforms > both BSJ donor and acceptor splice sites at the annotated exon boundaries > BSJs detected by multiple tools > supporting functional features > both BSJ donor and acceptor splice sites undergoing alternative splicing. By extracting RT-independent circRNAs, circRNAs passing multiple experimental validations, and database-specific circRNAs, we showed the additive effects of these important factors in determining circRNA reliability. This study thus provides a useful guideline and an important resource for selecting high-confidence circRNAs for further investigations.",

    "abstract": "We analyzed large-scale post-translational modification (PTM) data to outline cell signaling pathways affected by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in ten lung cancer cell lines. Tyrosine phosphorylated, lysine ubiquitinated, and lysine acetylated proteins were concomitantly identified using sequential enrichment of post translational modification (SEPTM) proteomics. Machine learning was used to identify PTM clusters that represent functional modules that respond to TKIs. To model lung cancer signaling at the protein level, PTM clusters were used to create a co-cluster correlation network (CCCN) and select protein-protein interactions (PPIs) from a large network of curated PPIs to create a cluster-filtered network (CFN). Next, we constructed a Pathway Crosstalk Network (PCN) by connecting pathways from NCATS BioPlanet whose member proteins have PTMs that co-cluster. Interrogating the CCCN, CFN, and PCN individually and in combination yields insights into the response of lung cancer cells to TKIs. We highlight examples where cell signaling pathways involving EGFR and ALK exhibit crosstalk with BioPlanet pathways: Transmembrane transport of small molecules; and Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. These data identify known and previously unappreciated connections between receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signal transduction and oncogenic metabolic reprogramming in lung cancer. Comparison to a CFN generated from a previous multi-PTM analysis of lung cancer cell lines reveals a common core of PPIs involving heat shock/chaperone proteins, metabolic enzymes, cytoskeletal components, and RNA-binding proteins. Elucidation of points of crosstalk among signaling pathways employing different PTMs reveals new potential drug targets and candidates for synergistic attack through combination drug therapy.\n\nAuthor SummaryProtein post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and acetylation, are extensively employed by cell signaling pathways that regulate cell division, differentiation, migration, and cancer. We used machine learning to identify PTM clusters that represent functional modules in cell signaling pathways. These clusters were used to identify protein-protein interactions, and interactions between cell signaling pathways, that were active in lung cancer cells that were treated with anti-cancer drugs. We model these interactions as networks at three levels of granularity at the pathway, protein-protein interaction, and PTM levels. Interrogation of these networks yielded insights into molecular interactions between cell signaling pathways activated by oncogenes, transmembrane transport of small molecules, and glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. These analyses identify previously unappreciated mechanisms of crosstalk among signaling pathways between oncogenic tyrosine kinase signaling and proteins that regulate metabolic reprogramming in lung cancer, revealing new potential drug targets for combination therapy.",

    "abstract": "Leaves comprise a number of different cell-types that are patterned in the context of either the epidermal or inner cell layers. In grass leaves, two distinct anatomies develop in the inner leaf tissues depending on whether the leaf carries out C3 or C4 photosynthesis. In both cases a series of parallel veins develops that extends from the leaf base to the tip but in ancestral C3 species veins are separated by a greater number of intervening mesophyll cells than in derived C4 species. We have previously demonstrated that the GRAS transcription factor SCARECROW (SCR) regulates the number of photosynthetic mesophyll cells that form between veins in the leaves of the C4 species maize, whereas it regulates the formation of stomata in the epidermal leaf layer in the C3 species rice. Here we show that SCR is required for inner leaf patterning in the C4 species Setaria viridis but in this species the presumed ancestral stomatal patterning role is also retained. Through a comparative mutant analysis between maize, setaria and rice we further demonstrate that loss of NAKED-ENDOSPERM (NKD) INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) protein function exacerbates loss of function scr phenotypes in the inner leaf tissues of maize and setaria but not rice. Specifically, in both setaria and maize, scr;nkd mutants exhibit an increased proportion of fused veins with no intervening mesophyll cells, whereas inner leaf tissues are patterned normally in scr;nkd mutants of rice. Thus, combined action of SCR and NKD may control how many mesophyll cells are specified between veins in the leaves of C4 but not C3 grasses. Finally, we identified a maternal effect in maize in which maternally derived NKD can affect patterning of cells in leaf primordia that are initiated during embryogenesis. Together our results provide insight into the evolution of cell patterning in grass leaves, demonstrate a novel patterning role for IDD genes in C4 leaves and suggest that NKD can influence embryonic leaf development non-cell autonomously from the surrounding maternal tissue.\n\nSummary statementMutations in NKD IDD genes enhance loss of function scr phenotypes in the leaves of C4 grasses maize and Setaria viridis but not in the C3 grass rice, and reveal a maternal effect on cell-type patterning in leaves that are initiated during embryogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Environmental enrichment (EE) has been increasingly used to enhance and support the physiological fitness and natural behavior of research animals. For mice, which are known to be highly active nocturnal animals that live in large social groups, the introduction of running wheels is a particularly promising approach in EE. When wheels are introduced to their home cage, mice increase their nocturnal locomotion activity by orders of magnitude. However, little is known about how mice share such a readily adopted EE. Here, we studied wheel running in single-housed and group-housed mice. We hypothesized that group-housed mice will compete over the scarce resource of a running wheel leading to a change in overall wheel usage compared to single-housed mice that have exclusive wheel access. We measured wheel locomotion in two strains of single-housed and group-housed mice over multiple 24h periods at sub-second temporal resolution using a custom-designed data acquisition system. We observed both sex- and housing-specific differences in wheel usage. In single-housed C57Bl/6 mice, mice ran at consistent speeds and females ran larger distances. In group housing, periods of slow locomotion speeds as well as speed transitions emerged with fewer breaks in wheel usage. This group effect was less pronounced in a genetic mouse model (parvalbumin-Cre on C57Bl/6 background).\n\nOur results demonstrate a change in wheel usage during group housing which supports competition over EE resources while enhancing overall locomotion in mice.",

    "abstract": "Circadian regulation of autonomic reflex pathways pairs physiological function with the daily light cycle. The brainstem nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) is a key candidate for rhythmic control of the autonomic nervous system. Here we investigated circadian regulation of NTS neurotransmission and synaptic throughput using patch-clamp electrophysiology in brainstem slices from mice. We found that spontaneous quantal glutamate release on to NTS neurons showed strong circadian rhythmicity, with the highest rate of release during the light phase and the lowest in the dark, that were sufficient to drive day / night differences in constitutive postsynaptic action potential firing. In contrast, afferent-evoked action potential throughput was enhanced during the dark and diminished in the light. Afferent-driven synchronous release pathways showed a similar decrease in release probability that did not explain the enhanced synaptic throughput during the night. However, analysis of postsynaptic membrane properties revealed diurnal changes in conductance; which, when coupled with the circadian changes in glutamate release pathways, tuned synaptic throughput between the light and dark phases. These coordinated pre- / postsynaptic changes encode nuanced control over synaptic performance and pair NTS action potential firing and vagal throughput with time of day.",

    "abstract": "GABAB receptor (GBR) activation inhibits neurotransmitter release in axon terminals in the brain, except in medial habenula (MHb) terminals, which show robust potentiation. However, mechanisms underlying this enigmatic potentiation remain elusive. Here, we report that GBR activation induces a transition from tonic to phasic release accompanied by a 4-fold increase in readily releasable pool (RRP) size in MHb terminals, mirrored by a similar increase in the docked vesicle number at the presynaptic active zone (AZ). The tonic and phasic release vesicles have distinct coupling distances. We identified two vesicle-associated molecules, synaptoporin and CAPS2, selectively involved in tonic and phasic release, respectively. Synaptoporin mediates augmentation of tonic release and CAPS2 stabilizes readily releasable vesicles during phasic release. A newly developed \"Flash and Freeze-fracture\" method revealed selective recruitment of CAPS2 to the AZ during phasic release. Thus, we propose a novel two-pool mechanism underlying the GBR-mediated potentiation of release from MHb terminals.",

    "abstract": "Relapse to drug seeking involves transient synaptic remodeling that occurs in response to drug associated cues. This remodeling includes activation of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) to initiate catalytic signaling in the extracellular matrix (ECM) in the nucleus accumbens core (NAcore). We hypothesized that MMP activity would be increased in the NAcore during cue-induced methamphetamine (meth) seeking in a rat model of meth use and relapse. Male and female rats had indwelling jugular catheters and bilateral intracranial cannula targeting the NAcore surgically implanted. Following recovery, rats underwent meth or saline self-administration (6hr/day for 15 days) in which active lever responding was paired with a light+tone stimulus complex, followed by home cage abstinence. Testing occurred after 7 or 30 days of abstinence. On test day, rats were microinjected with a FITC-quenched gelatin substrate that fluoresces following cleavage by MMPs, allowing for the quantification of gelatinase activity by MMP-2 and -9 during cued relapse testing. MMP-2,9 activity was significantly increased in the NAcore by meth cues presentation after 7 and 30 days of abstinence, indicating that remodeling by MMPs occurs during presentation of meth associated cues. Surprisingly, while cue-induced seeking increased between days 7 and 30, suggesting behavioral incubation, MMP-2,9 activity did not increase. These findings indicate that while MMP activation is elicited during meth cue-induced seeking, MMP activation did not parallel the behavioral incubation that occurs during extended drug abstinence.",

Furthermore, striatal tTIS enhanced motor performance, especially in healthy older participants as they have lower natural learning skills than younger subjects.

    "abstract": "BackgroundAssessment of cellular immune responses by combining intracellular cytokine staining and immunophenotyping using flow cytometry enables the simultaneous measurement of T cell phenotype and effector function in response to pathogens and vaccines. The use of whole blood samples rather than peripheral blood mononuclear cells avoids both the need for immediate processing and loss of functional antigen presenting cells due to processing and cryopreservation. Using whole blood provides the possibility to stimulate peripheral T cells in situ, and is more suitable for studies where sample volume is limited, such as those involving children, the elderly and critically ill patients. The aim of this study was to provide a robust tool for the assessment of antigen-specific T cell responses in a field site setting with limited resources.\n\nMethodology/Principle FindingsWe optimised a flow cytometry-based whole blood intracellular cytokine assay (WBA) with respect to duration of antigen stimulation and intracellular protein retention time. We demonstrate the ability of the WBA to capture polyfunctional T cell responses in the context of acute scrub typhus infection, by measuring IFN-{gamma}, TNF and IL-2 in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in response to the causative agent O. tsutsugamushi (OT). Using an optimised OT antigen preparation, we demonstrate the presence of polyfunctional antigen-specific memory CD4+ T cells in the blood of scrub typhus patients.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceIn conclusion, this flow cytometry-based WBA is well-suited for use at field study sites, and enables the assessment of polyfunctional T cell responses to infectious agents and vaccines through delineation of antigen-specific cytokine secretion at the single cell level.\n\nAuthor summaryScrub typhus is an acute febrile illness caused by the bite of infected chigger mites transmitting O. tsutsugamushi, a gramnegative obligate intracellular bacteria in the family Rickettsiaceae. The disease progression and clinical manifestations are closely associated with host immune responses. T cell responses are in strong relation with immune protection against scrub typhus. As there is limited knowledge on specific T cell roles against scrub typhus, we optimized a flow-cytometer based protocol to assess O. tsutsugumushi-specific T cell responses in whole blood samples, which is suitable for studies in limited resource settings. This method requires low blood volumes, but enables multiparametric immunophenotyping assessments. The optimized WBA protocol could be a useful tool for comprehensive immunopathological studies in scrub typhus, and other infectious diseases as well as vaccine studies in areas with limited availability of specialized equipment, while reliably capturing the complexity of the immune response.",

    "abstract": "Microbiota-gut-brain axis is an evident pathway of host-microbiota crosstalk that is linked to multiple brain disorders. Microbiota released extracellular vesicles (MEVs) has emerged as a key player in intercellular signaling in host microbiome communications. However, their role in gutbrain axis signaling is poorly investigated. Here, we performed a deep multi-omics profiling of MEVs content generated ex vivo and from stool samples in order to get some insights on their role in gut-brain-axis signaling. Metabolomics profiling identified a wide array of metabolites embedded in MEVs, including lipids, carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, and organic acids. Interestingly, many neurotransmitter-related compounds were detected inside MEVs, including arachidonyl-dopamine (NADA), gabapentin, glutamate and N-acylethanolamines. Next, we aimed to identify commensal microbes with psychobiotic activity. We isolated 58 Bacteroides strains assigned to four genera, 11 species, and 4 new species based on 16S rDNA sequencing. We performed whole genome sequencing of 18 representative isolates, followed by a comparative analysis of the structure of polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) and glutamate decarboxylase (GAD), a genetic system involved in GABA production. Quantifying GABA was done using competitive ELISA, wherein three isolates (B. finegoldii, B. faecis, and B. caccae) showed high GABA production (4.5-7 mM range) in supernatant whereas 2.2 to 4 uM GABA concentration was detected inside microvesicles extracted using ultracentrifugation. To test the biodistribution of MEVs from the gut to other parts of the body, CACO-2, RIN-14 B, and hCMEC/D3 cells showed a capacity to internalize labeled MEVs through an endocytic mechanism. Additionally, MEVs exhibited a dose dependent paracellular transport through CACO-2 intestinal cells and hCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cells. In vivo results showed biodistribution of MEVs to liver, stomach and spleen. Overall, our results reveal the capabilities of MEVs to cross the intestinal and blood brain barriers to deliver their cargoes of neuroactive molecules to the brain as a new signaling mechanism in microbiota-gut-brain axis communications.",

    "abstract": "As human density increases, biodiversity must increasingly co-exist with urbanization or face local extinction. Tolerance of urban areas has been linked to numerous functional traits, yet few globally-consistent patterns have emerged to explain variation in urban tolerance, which stymies attempts at a generalizable predictive framework. Here, we calculate an Urban Association Index (UAI) for 3768 bird species in 137 cities across all permanently inhabited continents. We then assess how UAI varies as a function of ten species-specific traits and further test whether the strength of trait relationships vary as a function of three city-specific variables. Of the ten species traits, nine were significantly associated with urban tolerance. Urban-associated species tend to be smaller, less territorial, have greater dispersal ability, broader dietary and habitat niches, larger clutch sizes, greater longevity, and have lower elevational limits. Only bill shape showed no global association with urban tolerance. Additionally, the strength of several trait relationships varied across cities as a function of latitude and/or human population density. For example, the effects of body mass and diet breadth are more pronounced at higher latitudes, while the effects of territoriality and longevity were reduced in cities with higher population density. Thus, the importance of trait filters in birds varies predictably across cities, indicating biogeographic variation in selection for urban tolerance that could explain prior challenges in the search for global patterns. A globally-informed framework that predicts urban tolerance will be integral to conservation as increasing proportions of the worlds biodiversity are impacted by urbanization.",

    "abstract": "Malaria control uses insecticides to kill Anopheles mosquitoes. Recent successes in malaria control are threatened by increasing levels of insecticide resistance (IR), requiring insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategies to mitigate this problem. Field trials of IRM strategies are usually prohibitively expensive with long timeframes, and mathematical modelling is often used to evaluate alternative options. Previous IRM models in the context of malaria control assumed IR to have a simple (monogenic) basis, whereas in natural populations, IR will often be a complex polygenic trait determined by multiple genetic variants.\n\nA quantitative genetics model was developed to model IR as a polygenic trait. The model allows insecticides to be deployed as sequences (continuous deployment until a defined withdrawal threshold, termed \"insecticide lifespan\", as indicated by resistance diagnosis in bioassays), rotations (periodic switching of insecticides), or full-dose mixtures (two insecticides in one formulation). These IRM strategies were compared based on their \"strategy lifespan\" (capped at 500 generations). Partial rank correlation and generalised linear modelling was used to identify and quantify parameters driving the evolution of resistance. Random forest models were used to identify parameters offering predictive value for decision-making.\n\nDeploying single insecticides as sequences or rotations usually made little overall difference to their \"strategy lifespan\", though rotations displayed lower mean and peak resistances. Deploying two insecticides in a full-dose mixture formulation was found to extend the \"strategy lifespan\" when compared to deploying each in sequence or rotation. This pattern was observed regardless of the level of cross resistance between the insecticides or the starting level of resistance. Statistical analysis highlighted the importance of insecticide coverage, cross resistance, heritability, and fitness costs for selecting an appropriate IRM strategy.\n\nFull-dose mixtures appear the most promising of the strategies evaluated, with the longest \"strategy lifespans\". These conclusions broadly corroborate previous results from monogenic models.\n\nAuthor SummaryInsecticides impregnated into bed-nets or sprayed on walls are used to kill the Anopheles mosquitoes which transmit malaria. Unfortunately, the usage of insecticides has inevitably led to mosquitoes evolving resistance to the toxic effect of these insecticides. Insecticide resistance management strategies may be used to slow the rate of resistance evolution, however which strategies are effective, and when they are effective, is often unclear. Previous models evaluating insecticide resistance management strategies have assumed resistance is encoded by a single gene (is a monogenic trait). However, in natural populations resistance may be determined by multiple genes (is a polygenic trait). It is unclear whether such increased model complexity may change predictions We modelled resistance as a polygenic trait and found little difference in the benefit between rotating insecticides regularly versus deploying continuously until resistance reaches a critical threshold then switching. In contrast, mixtures combining two insecticides extended the projected lifespan of the insecticides, even when they share resistance mechanisms (cross resistance). Similar findings from previous monogenic models, strengthen support for the use of full-dose mixtures.",

A covariance of homozygosity between pairs of markers arises when populations follow a mixture distribution.

    "abstract": "Mutations in the DMD gene are causative for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Antisense oligonucleotide (AON) mediated exon skipping to restore disrupted dystrophin reading frame is a therapeutic approach that allows production of a shorter but functional protein. As DMD causing mutations can affect most of the 78 exons encoding dystrophin, a wide variety of AONs are needed to treat the patient population. Design of AONs is largely guided by trial-and-error, and it is yet unclear what defines the skippability of an exon.\n\nHere, we use a library of phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomer (PMOs) AONs of similar physical properties to test the skippability of a large number of DMD exons. The DMD transcript is non-sequentially spliced, meaning that certain introns are retained longer in the transcript than downstream introns. We tested whether the relative intron retention time has a significant effect on AON efficiency, and found that targeting an exon flanked at its 5 by an intron that is retained in the transcript longer ( slow intron) leads to overall higher exon skipping efficiency than when the 5 intron is  fast. Regardless of splicing speed of flanking introns, we find that positioning an AON closer to the 5 of the target exon leads to higher exon skipping efficiency opposed to targeting an exons 3-end.\n\nThe data enclosed herein can be of use to guide future target selection and preferential AON binding sites for both Duchenne and other disease amenable by exon skipping therapies.",

    "abstract": "Multi-enhancer hubs are spatial clusters of enhancers which have been recently characterized across numerous developmental programs. Yet, the functional relevance of these three-dimensional (3D) structures is poorly understood. Here we show that the multiplicity of enhancers interacting with the transcription factor Ets1 is essential to control the precise expression level of this gene in response to cellular cues, and the failure to do so can lead to allergic diseases. Focusing on T cells as a model, we identified a highly connected multi-enhancer hub at the Ets1 locus, comprising a noncoding regulatory element that is a hotspot for sequence variation associated with allergic diseases. We deleted this hotspot and found that the multi-enhancer connectivity is dispensable for T cell development but required for CD4+ T helper (Th1) differentiation in response to changes in the cytokine milieu. Mice lacking this hotspot are thus protected from Th1-mediated colitis but demonstrate an overt allergic response to house dust mites, a T cell-mediated response which is dampened by Th1 cells. Mechanistically, the multi-enhancer hub controls the expression level of Ets1 that is dispensable for the active enhancer landscape but required for the Th1-specific genome topology through recruitment of CTCF. Together, we establish a paradigm for the functional and mechanistic relevance of multi-enhancer hubs controlling cellular competence to respond specifically to an inductive cue.",

    "abstract": "To extract biological meaning from transcriptomics analysis, investigators almost exclusively rely on biological annotation databases and the subsequent associations made between gene products and ontology terms (i.e., gene ontology analysis). Although there is ease and utility to this approach, multiple hypothesis testing methods such as differential expression analysis are performed in the absence of in silico validation, and downstream gene ontology analysis methods lack precision and propagate Type I error. Therefore, we present a novel R package, Functional Association Vectors (FACTORs), that begins to address some of the common pitfalls associated with functional association studies in transcriptomics research. FACTORs are vectorized containers for directly comparing and testing congruent functional association statistics at the molecular level. Our goal was to develop novel methodology an R software package to allow for the experimental validation of differentially expressed genes that are conserved across studies and to reduce Type I error in the down-stream functional analysis of these signals. FACTORs are generalizable and flexible, allowing for any association statistic such as log fold change (logFC), t-statistic, p-value, or other functional significance score. To demonstrate utility of FACTORs in the cross-study validation of global mRNA expression profiling, we used differential expression analysis summary statistics obtained from two studies with publicly available transcriptomic data. Through this demonstration we show FACTORs provide a more precise and generalizable functional hypothesis testing methodology and data reduction approach that directly tests functional association statistics at the molecular level, across experiments.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWe present a novel statistical methodology and software tool that can be used to validate transcriptomic data across studies. FACTORs is available as an R package and will aid in transcriptomic data reduction, identifying gene expression profiles that are conserved across studies, and improving the precision and generalizability of functional association studies. We propose FACTORs as a generalizable methodology for reducing Type I error and increasing the biological relevance of functional associations in transcriptomics studies.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have been studied as an alternative devices to the tobacco cigarette, but with better safety for the health of smokers, so as to create a new approach to smoking addiction, such as the \"smoking harm reduction\". This new approach, suggested by a part of the scientific world, aroused interest and debates in the regulatory field, involving all the major regulatory bodies and often creating divergences from nation to nation on the rules driving the production, distribution and consumption of these alternative products. Many studies have been conducted both in vitro and in vivo, to clarify the effects of the e-cigarette compared to the classic one. In this context, the Center of Excellence for the Acceleration of HArm Reduction (CoEHAR) was established within the University of Catania (Italy) and the multi-center project, created under its leadership, the REPLICA project, which aims to replicate in vitro studies originally conducted by tobacco and e-cigarette manufacturers, in order to verify the robustness and replicability of the data. In this work the REPLICA Team replicated part of the work published by Rudd and colleagues in 2020, which aims to establish the aerosol-induced cytotoxicity, mutagenesis and genotoxicity of a pod system e-cigarette aerosol compared to tobacco cigarette smoke. As in the original paper, we performed Neutral Red Test (NRU) for the evaluation of cytotoxicity, AMES test for the evaluation of mutagenesis and In Vitro Micronuclei (IVM) assay for the evaluation of genotoxicity on cells treated with cigarette smoke or e-cigarette aerosol. The results obtained showed high cytotoxicity, mutagenicity and genotoxicity induced by cigarette smoke, but slight or no cytotoxic, mutagenic and genotoxic effects induced by the e-cigarette aerosol. The data obtained support those previously presented by Rudd and colleagues, although we have highlighted some methodological flaws of their work. Overall, we can affirm that the results obtained by Rudd and colleagues have been established and our data also confirm the idea that e-cigarette aerosol is much safer and less harmful than cigarette smoking, making it a useful device in smoking harm reduction.",

In this study, a unique strategy to overcome these limitations is explored based on engineered living materials (ELMs). These are an emerging class of composite materials, which contain live microorganisms that can be engineered to produce and secrete proteins in response to external stimuli. Herein, the development of an ELM that light-responsively releases a pro-angiogenic protein is described. This is achieved by optogenetically engineering bacteria to synthesize and secrete a fusion protein containing a vascular endothelial growth factor peptidomimetic linked to a collagen-binding domain. The bacteria are securely encapsulated in bilayer hydrogel constructs that support bacterial functionality but prevent their escape from the ELM. The possibility to switch protein release ON and OFF with light and to tune the amount released with different light intensities is demonstrated. Finally, it is shown that the released protein is active through its ability to bind to collagen and promote angiogenic network formation in human vascular endothelial cell cultures, indicating the regenerative potential of these ELMs.",

However, limited knowledge exists regarding the mechanistic insights into the FOXM1 gene regulation. p68, an archetypal member of the DEAD-box family of RNA helicases, shows multifaceted action in cancer progression by arbitrating RNA metabolism and transcriptionally coactivating transcription factors. Here, we report a novel mechanism of alliance between p68 and the Wnt/{beta}-catenin pathway in regulating FOXM1 gene expression and driving colon carcinogenesis. Initial bioinformatic analyses highlighted elevated expression levels of FOXM1 and p68 in colorectal cancer datasets. Immunohistochemical assays confirmed that FOXM1 showed a positive correlation with p68 and {beta}-catenin in both normal and colon carcinoma patient samples. Overexpression of p68 and {beta}-catenin increased the protein and mRNA expression profiles of FOXM1, and the converse correlation occurred during downregulation. Mechanistically, overexpression and knockdown of p68 and {beta}-catenin elevated and diminished FOXM1 promoter activity respectively. Additionally, Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated the occupancy of p68 and {beta}-catenin at the TCF4/LEF binding element (TBE) sites on the FOXM1 promoter. Thiostrepton delineated the effect of FOXM1 inhibition on cell proliferation and migration. Colony formation assay, migration assay, and cell cycle data reveal the importance of the p68/{beta}-catenin/FOXM1 axis in oncogenesis.

    "abstract": "BackgroundApproximately half of all cancer patients receive radiotherapy and, as cancer survivorship rates increase with more effective therapies, the very low rate of radiation-associated sarcomas is rising. Radiation-associated sarcomas are life-threatening cancers, and radiation exposure is a primary risk factor for sarcoma development. During radiotherapy or other genotoxic cancer therapy for p53 mutant cancers, pharmacological inhibition of p53 has been proposed to ameliorate acute injury of normal tissues. However, enhancing the survival of normal cells that sustain DNA damage by temporarily inhibiting p53 has the potential to increase the risk of cancer development. Here, we use in vivo shRNA technology to examine the consequences of temporarily reducing p53 expression on radiation-induced sarcoma development.\n\nMethodsWe utilized a mouse model of radiation-induced sarcoma where mice express a doxycycline (dox)-inducible p53 shRNA to temporarily and reversibly reduce p53 expression. Mice were placed on a dox diet 10 days prior to receiving 30 or 40 Gy hind limb irradiation in a single fraction and then returned to normal chow. Mice were examined weekly for sarcoma development and scored for radiation-induced normal tissue injuries. Radiation-induced sarcomas were harvested and subjected to RNA sequencing.\n\nResultsFollowing single high-dose irradiation, 21% of temporary p53 knockdown animals developed a sarcoma in the radiation field compared to 2% of control animals. Mice with more severe acute injuries in the first 3 months after irradiation had a significantly increased risk of developing late persistent wounds in the soft tissue and bone. Chronic radiation-induced wounds were associated with sarcomagenesis. Examination of muscle stem cells by flow cytometry following hind limb irradiation indicated p53 knockdown preserves muscle stem cells in the irradiated limb, supporting the notion that temporary p53 knockdown at the time of irradiation reduces death of cells with DNA damage which may then persist to develop into a sarcoma. We performed RNA sequencing on 16 radiation-induced sarcomas compared to normal muscle controls. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation in the sarcomas of genes related to translation, epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), inflammation, and the cell cycle versus downregulation of genes related to myogenesis and tumor metabolism. Furthermore, genes with increased copy number such as Met and Cdk4 were overexpressed in tumors.\n\nConclusionsTemporary reduction of p53 during high-dose irradiation increases late effects including tissue injuries and sarcoma development.",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) populations exhibit vast amounts of genetic and phenotypic diversity. As sequencing costs have declined, an increasing number of projects have sought to measure genetic differences between and within maize populations using whole genome resequencing strategies, identifying millions of segregating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (InDels). Unlike older genotyping strategies like microarrays and genotyping by sequencing, resequencing should, in principle, frequently identify and score common genetic variants. However, in practice, different projects frequently employ different analytical pipelines, often employ different reference genome assemblies, and consistently filter for minor allele frequency within the study population. This constrains the potential to reuse and remix data on genetic diversity generated from different projects to address new biological questions in new ways. Here we employ resequencing data from 1,276 previously published maize samples and 239 newly resequenced maize samples to generate a single unified marker set of [~]366 million segregating variants and [~]46 million high confidence variants scored across crop wild relatives, landraces as well as tropical and temperate lines from different breeding eras. We demonstrate that the new variant set provides increased power to identify known causal flowering time genes using previously published trait datasets, as well as the potential to track changes in the frequency of functionally distinct alleles across the global distribution of modern maize.",

    "abstract": "The collective nature of the variation in host associated microbial communities suggest that they exhibit low dimensional characteristics. To identify these lower dimensional descriptors, we propose SMbiot (pronounced SIM BY OT): a Shared Latent Model for Microbiomes and their hosts. In SMbiot, latent variables embed host-specific microbial communities in a lower dimensional space and the corresponding features reflect controlling axes that dictate community compositions. Using data from different animal hosts, organ sites, and microbial kingdoms of life, we show that SMbiot identifies a small number of host-specific latent variables that accurately capture the compositional variation in host associated microbial communities. By using the same latents to describe hosts phenotypic states and the host-associated microbiomes, we show that the latent space embedding is informed by host physiology as well as the associated microbiomes. Importantly, SMbiot enables the quantification of host phenotypic differences associated with altered microbial community compositions in a host-specific manner, underscoring the context specificity of host-microbiome associations. SMbiot can also predict missing host metadata or microbial community compositions. This way, SMbiot is a concise quantitative method to understand the low dimensional collective behavior of host-associated microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the structural and molecular features of the lymphatic vasculature, which clears fluid, macromolecules and leukocytes from the tissue microenvironment, have largely relied on animal models, with limited information in human organs beyond traditional immunohistochemical assessment. Here, we use three-dimensional imaging and single-cell RNA-sequencing to study lymphatics in the human kidney. We found a hierarchical arrangement of lymphatic vessels within human kidneys, initiating along specialised nephron epithelium in the renal cortex and displaying a distinct, kidney-specific transcriptional profile. In chronic transplant rejection we found kidney allograft lymphatic expansion alongside a loss of structural hierarchy, with human leukocyte antigen-expressing lymphatic vessels infiltrating the medulla, presenting a putative target for alloreactive antibodies. This occurred concurrently with lymphatic vessels invading and interconnecting tertiary lymphoid structures at early stages of lymphocyte colonisation. Analysis of intercellular signalling revealed upregulation of co-inhibitory molecule-mediated CD4+ T cell-lymphatic crosstalk in rejecting kidneys, potentially acting to limit local alloimmune responses. Overall, we delineate novel structural and molecular features of human kidney lymphatics and reveal perturbations to their phenotype and transcriptome in the context of alloimmunity.\n\nSUMMARYLymphatics regulate fluid balance and immune cell accumulation but are under-studied in human organs such as the kidney. Jafree and colleagues profiled human kidney lymphatics using three-dimensional imaging and single-cell RNA-sequencing, revealing structural and transcriptional perturbations in rejecting kidney transplants.",

    "abstract": "Predicting how species diversity changes along environmental gradients is an enduring problem in ecology. Current theories cannot explain the observation that microbial taxonomic richness can show positive, unimodal, as well as negative diversity-temperature gradients. Here we derive a general empirically-grounded theory that can explain this phenomenon by linking microbial species richness in local communities to variation in their temperature-driven competitive interaction and growth rates. It predicts that richness depends on variation in shape of the thermal performance curves of these metabolic traits across species in the community. Specifically, the shape of the microbial community temperature-richness relationship depends on how the strength of competition across the community and the degree of variation in growth rates changes across temperature. These in turn can be predicted from the variation in thermal performance across the community. We show that empirical variation in the thermal performance curves of metabolic traits across extant bacterial taxa is indeed sufficient to generate the variety of community-level temperature-richness responses observed in the real world. Our results provide a new mechanism that can help explain temperature-diversity gradients in microbial communities, and provide a quantitative framework for interlinking variation in the thermal physiology of microbial species to their community-level diversity.",

    "abstract": "The rate of mutation varies among positions in a genome. Local sequence context can affect the rate, and has different effects on different types of mutation. Here I report an effect of local context that operates to some extent in all bacteria examined: the rate of T[-&gt;]G mutation is greatly increased by preceding runs of three or more G residues. The strength of the effect increases with the length of the run. In Salmonella, in which the effect is strongest, a G run of length three increases the rate by a factor of ~26, a run of length four increases it by almost a factor of 100, and runs of length five or more increase it by a factor of more than 400 on average. The effect is much stronger when the T is on the leading rather than the lagging strand of DNA replication. Several observations eliminate the possibility that this effect is an artifact of sequencing error.",

    "abstract": "In a dynamic environment, the already limited information that human working memory can maintain needs to be constantly updated to optimally guide behaviour. Indeed, previous studies showed that working memory representations are continuously being transformed during delay periods leading up to a response. This goes hand-in-hand with the removal of task-irrelevant items. However, does such removal also include veridical, original stimuli, as they were prior to transformation? Here we aimed to assess the neural representation of task-relevant transformed representations, compared to the no-longer-relevant veridical representations they originated from. We applied multivariate pattern analysis to electroencephalographic data during maintenance of orientation gratings with and without mental rotation. During maintenance, we perturbed the representational network by means of a visual impulse stimulus, and were thus able to successfully decode veridical as well as imaginary, transformed orientation gratings from impulse-driven activity. On the one hand, the impulse response reflected only task-relevant (cued), but not task-irrelevant (uncued) items, suggesting that the latter were quickly discarded from working memory. By contrast, even though the original cued orientation gratings were also no longer task-relevant after mental rotation, these items continued to be represented next to the rotated ones, in different representational formats. This seemingly inefficient use of scarce working memory capacity was associated with reduced probe response times and may thus serve to increase precision and flexibility in guiding behaviour in dynamic environments.",
