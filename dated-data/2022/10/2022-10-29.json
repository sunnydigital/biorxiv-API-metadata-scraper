    "abstract": "There are no known drugs or drug combinations that promote substantial central nervous system axonal regeneration after injury. We used systems pharmacology approaches to model pathways underlying axonal growth and identify a four-drug combination that regulates multiple subcellular processes in the cell body and axon using the optic nerve crush model in rats. We intravitreally injected agonists HU-210 (cannabinoid receptor-1) and IL-6 (interleukin 6 receptor) to stimulate retinal ganglion cells for axonal growth. We applied, in gel foam at the site of nerve injury, Taxol to stabilize growing microtubules, and activated protein C to clear the debris field since computational models predicted that this drug combination regulating two subcellular processes at the growth cone produces synergistic growth. Morphology experiments show that the four-drug combination promotes axonal regrowth to the optic chiasm and beyond. Physiologically, drug treatment restored pattern electroretinograms and some of the animals had detectable visual evoked potentials in the brain and behavioral optokinetic responses. We conclude that spatially targeted drug treatment can promote robust axonal regeneration and can restore limited functional recovery.",

    "abstract": "We model the evolutionary epidemiology of spore-producing plant pathogens in heterogeneous environments sown with several cultivars carrying quantitative resistances. The model explicitly tracks the infection-age structure and genetic composition of the pathogen population. Each strain is characterized by pathogenicity traits describing its infection efficiency and a time-varying sporulation curve taking into account lesion ageing. We first derive a general expression of the basic reproduction number [R]0 for fungal pathogens in heterogeneous environments. We show that evolutionary attractors of the model coincide with local maxima of [R]0 only if the infection efficiency is the same on all host types. We then study how three basic resistance characteristics (pathogenicity trait targeted, resistance effectiveness, and adaptation cost) in interaction with the deployment strategy (proportion of fields sown with a resistant cultivar) (i) lead to pathogen diversification at equilibrium and (ii) shape the transient dynamics from evolutionary and epidemiological perspectives. We show that quantitative resistance impacting only the sporulation curve will always lead to a monomorphic population, while dimorphism (i.e. pathogen diversification) can occur with resistance altering infection efficiency, notably with high adaptation cost and proportion of R cultivar. Accordingly, the choice of quantitative resistance genes operated by plant breeders is a driver of pathogen diversification. From an evolutionary perspective, the emergence time of the evolutionary attractor best adapted to the R cultivar tends to be shorter when the resistance impacts infection efficiency than when it impacts sporulation. In contrast, from an epidemiological perspective, the epidemiological control is always higher when the resistance impacts infection efficiency. This highlights the difficulty of defining deployment strategies of quantitative resistance maximising at the same time epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes.",

However, it is difficult to practically make use of the relationship between sequence and phenotype due to the complex relationship between sequence and folding or activity.\n\nResultsHere, we predict the originating species optimal growth temperatures of individual protein sequences using trained machine learning models. Both multilayer perceptron and k Nearest Neighbor regression outperformed linear regression could predict the originating species optimal growth temperature from protein sequences, achieving a root mean squared error of 3.6 {degrees}C. Similar machine learning models could predict organismal optimal growth pH and oxygen tolerance, and the quantitative properties of individual proteins or nucleic acids.\n\nConclusionsUsing multilayer perceptron and k Nearest Neighbor regressions, we were able to build models specific to individual protein or nucleic acid families that can predict a variety of quantitative phenotypes. This methodology will be useful the in silico screening of individual mutations for particular properties, and also effective in the predicting the phenotypes of uncharacterized biological sequences and organisms.",

    "abstract": "Protein phosphorylation regulates numerous cellular processes and is highly studied in biology.However, the analysis of phosphoproteomic datasets remains challenging due to limited information on upstream regulators of phosphosites, which is fragmented across multiple curated databases and unstructured literature. When aggregating information on phosphosites from six databases and three text mining systems, we found that a substantial proportion of phosphosites were mentioned at residue positions not matching the reference sequence. These errors were often attributable to the use of residue numbers from non-canonical protein isoforms, mouse or rat proteins, or post-translationally processed proteins. Non-canonical site numbering is also prevalent in mass spectrometry datasets from large-scale efforts such as the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC). To address these issues, we developed ProtMapper, an open-source Python tool that automatically normalizes site positions to human protein reference sequences. We used ProtMapper coupled with the INDRA knowledge assembly system to create a corpus of 37,028 regulatory annotations for 16,332 sites - to our knowledge, the most comprehensive corpus of literature-derived information about phosphosite regulation currently available. This work highlights how automated phosphosite normalization coupled to text mining and knowledge assembly allows researchers to leverage phosphosite information that exists within the scientific literature.",

    "abstract": "Cathelicidin antimicrobial peptides are a diverse family of cationic amphipathic peptides with multiple activities. In humans, cathelicidin LL-37 is one of the main host defense peptides with a remarkable medical and biotechnological potential. Deregulation of LL-37 expression has been associated with inflammatory diseases. However the effects of point mutations driven by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on LL-37 are unknown. Here we applied an array of computational tools to investigate the effects of such mutations on LL-37 structure and activity. Due to the fact that, on cathelicidins, the prodomain is more conserved than the mature peptide, the SNP effect predictions were biased and, overall, resulted in neutral effects; and due to the slight changes in physicochemical properties, the antimicrobial predictions indicated the maintenance of such activity. Nonetheless, R07P, R07W, R29Q, R29W mutations reduced the peptide net charge, which in turn could result in less active LL-37 variants. Molecular dynamics data indicated that R07Q and N30Y mutations altered the LL-37 structure, leading to potential deleterious effects. In addition, the helix dipole is altered in G03A, R07P, R07W and L31P mutations, which could also alter the antimicrobial activity. Our results indicated that despite the mutations did not alter the residues from LL-37 active core, they could influence the antimicrobial activity and consequently, could be involved in inflammatory diseases.",

    "abstract": "Elaborate behaviours are produced by tightly controlled flexor-extensor motor neuron activation patterns. Motor neurons are regulated by a network of interneurons within the spinal cord, but the computational processes involved in motor control are not fully understood. The neuroanatomical arrangement of motor and premotor neurons into topographic patterns related to their controlled muscles is thought to facilitate how information is processed by spinal circuits. Rabies retrograde monosynaptic tracing has been used to label premotor interneurons innervating specific motor neuron pools, with previous studies reporting topographic mediolateral positional biases in flexor and extensor premotor interneurons. To more precisely define how premotor interneurons contacting specific motor pools are organized we used multiple complementary viral-tracing approaches to minimize systematic biases associated with each method. Contrary to expectations, we found that premotor interneurons contacting motor pools controlling flexion and extension of the ankle are highly intermingled rather than segregated into specific domains like motor neurons. Thus, premotor spinal neurons controlling different muscles process motor instructions in the absence of clear spatial patterns among the flexor-extensor circuit components.\n\nThe paper can be downloaded in executable format as a MATLAB live script from https://github.com/marcobeato/Spinal_premotor_interneurons_controlling_antagonistic_muscles_are_spatially_intermingled, where all the data are available An R version of the executable paper is available at https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rronzano/Spinal_premotor_interneurons_controlling_antagonistic_muscles_are_spatially_intermingled.git/HEAD?urlpath=rstudio",

    "abstract": "Shigella species causes shigellosis that requires antibiotic treatment in severe cases. Sub-lethal antibiotic concentrations can promote resistance, but their effect on antibiotic-sensitive bacteria prior to resistance development is unknown. This study investigated the effects of sublethal norfloxacin challenges on a norfloxacin-sensitive strain Shigella sonnei UKMCC1015. We show that low levels of norfloxacin do not change the antimicrobial resistance genes and norfloxacin targets expression. Instead, multiple ribosomal protein genes were downregulated.which could beattributed to a decrease in the ribosomal protein promoter activity, modulated by ppGpp. Under sublethal norfloxacin stress and high ppGpp levels, the cells underwent filamentation suggesting that ppGpp regulates the response of S. sonnei to norfloxacinWe speculate that high ppGpp levels play roles in modulating the developmentof antibiotic resistance in the sensitive strain. Indeed, the adaptive evolution of UKMCC1015 in the presence of norfloxacin revealed that the evolved strain 5c developed a mutation in gyrA (Asp87Tyr) gene conferring reduced norfloxacin susceptibility and reduced filamentation. These results collectively suggest that ppGpp may not be involved in regulating the mutants response to norfloxacin exposure.\n\nData SummaryThe complete genome of Shigella sonnei UKMCC1015 and its plasmids have been deposited at GenBank under accession numbers CP060117, CP060118 and CP060119.

Our enhanced inverted encoding model (eIEM) incorporates theoretical and methodological improvements including proper accounting of population-level tuning functions and a trial-by-trial prediction error-based metric where reconstruction quality is measured in meaningful units. Added functionality and improved flexibility is further gained via eIEMs novel goodness-of-fit feature: for trial-by-trial reconstructions, goodness-of-fits are obtained independently (non-circularly) to prediction error and can be applied to any IEM procedure or decoding metric, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and brain-behavior correlations, and more creative applications. We validate eIEM from methodological principles, simulated neuroimaging datasets, and three pre-existing fMRI datasets spanning perception, attention, and working memory. Notably, eIEM is easy to apply and broadly accessible - our Python package (https://pypi.org/project/inverted-encoding) implements eIEM in one line of code - and is easily modifiable to compare performance metrics and/or scale up to more complex models.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the mechanisms by which plasticity in millions of synapses in the brain is orchestrated to achieve behavioral and cognitive goals is a fundamental quest in neuroscience. In this regard, insights from learning methods in artificial neural networks (ANNs) and in particular supervised learning using backpropagation (BP) seem inspiring. However, the implementation of BP requires exact matching between forward and backward weights, which is unrealistic given the known connectivity pattern in the brain (known as \"weight transport problem\"). Notably, it has been shown that under certain conditions, error BackPropagation Through Arbitrary Weights (BP-TAW) can lead to a partial alignment between forward and backward weights (weight alignment or WA). This learning algorithm, which is also known as feedback alignment (FA), can result in surprisingly good degrees of accuracy in simple classification tasks. However, the underlying mechanisms and mathematical basis of WA are not thoroughly understood. In this work, we show that the occurrence of WA is governed by statistical properties of the output and error signals of neurons, such as autocorrelation and cross-correlation, and can happen even in the absence of learning or reduction of the loss function. Moreover, we show that WA can be improved significantly by limiting the norm of input weights to neurons and that such a weight normalization (WN) method can improve the classification accuracy of BP-TAW. The findings presented can be used to further improve the performance of BP-TAW and open new ways for exploring possible learning mechanisms in biological neural networks without exact matching between forward and backward weights.",

Resistance management involves maximizing selection pressure heterogeneity, particularly by combining active ingredients with different modes of action. We tested the hypothesis that alternation may delay the build-up of resistance not only by spreading selection pressure over longer periods, but also by decreasing the rate of evolution of resistance to alternated fungicides, by applying an experimental evolution approach to the economically important crop pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. Our results show that alternation is either neutral or slows the overall resistance evolution rate, relative to continuous fungicide use, but results in higher levels of generalism in evolved lines. We demonstrate that the nature of the fungicides, and therefore their relative intrinsic risk of resistance may underly this trade-off, more so than the number of fungicides and the rhythm of alternation. This trade-off is also dynamic over the course of resistance evolution. These findings open up new possibilities for tailoring resistance management effectively while optimizing interplay between alternation components.",

    "abstract": "Physiological states of bacterial cells exhibit a wide spectrum of timescale. Under nutrient-rich conditions, most of the cells in an isogenic bacterial population grow at certain rates, while a small subpopulation sometimes falls into a dormant state where the growth rates slow down by orders of magnitude. The dormant cells have unique characteristics: The metabolic activity is quite slow, and the dormant cells typically exhibit a high tolerance for a range of stresses, such as antibiotics applications. To reveal the origins of such heterogeneity of timescales, we constructed a kinetic model of Escherichia coli central carbon metabolism, including the dynamics of the energy currency molecules, and asked if perturbations of the metabolites concentrations lead to the distinct metabolic states. By numerically studying the relaxation dynamics, we found that the model robustly exhibits two qualitatively distinct relaxation dynamics depending on the initial conditions generated by the perturbations. In the first type, the concentrations of metabolites reach the steady-state quickly, resembling the growing dynamics. On the other hand, the other type of dynamics takes a much longer time to reach the steady-state, and during the relaxation, cell growth almost halts, reminding us of the dormant cells. In order to unveil the mechanism of distinct behaviors, we reduced the metabolic network model into a minimal model without losing the emergence of distinct dynamics. Analytical and numerical studies of the 2-variable minimal model revealed the necessary conditions for the distinct behavior, namely, the depletion of energy due to the futile cycle and its non-uniform impact on the kinetics because of the coexistence of the energy currency-coupled and uncoupled reactions as well as branching of the network. The result is consistent with the experimental reports that the dormant cells commonly exhibit low ATP levels and provides a possible explanation for the appearance of dormant cells that causes antibiotic persistence.",

However, the mechanisms of evolution do not act in isolation, and integrative models that simultaneously consider the influence of multiple factors on diversity are lacking; without them, confounding factors lurk in the estimates. Here we present a new statistical method that jointly infers the genomic landscapes of genealogies, recombination rates and mutation rates. In doing so, our model captures the effects of genetic drift, linked selection and local mutation rates on patterns of genomic variation. We then formalize a causal model of how these microevolutionary mechanisms interact, and cast it as a linear regression to estimate their individual contributions to levels of diversity along the genome. Our analyses reclaim the well-established signature of linked selection in Drosophila melanogaster, but we estimate that the mutation landscape is the major driver of the genome-wide distribution of diversity in this species. Furthermore, our simulation results suggest that in many evolutionary scenarios the mutation landscape will be a crucial factor shaping diversity, depending notably on the genomic window size. We argue that incorporating mutation rate variation into the null model of molecular evolution will lead to more realistic inferences in population genomics.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression evolution underlies the origin, divergence, and conservation of biological characters including cell-types, tissues, and organ systems. Previously we showed that large-scale gene expression changes in decidual stromal cells contributed to the origins of pregnancy in eutherians and the divergence of pregnancy traits in primates, and that transposable elements likely contributed to these gene expression changes. Here we show that two large waves of TEs remodeled the transcriptome and regulatory landscape of decidual stromal cells, including a major wave in primates. Genes nearby TE-derived regulatory elements are among the most progesterone responsive in the genome and play essential roles in orchestrating progesterone responsiveness and the core function of decidual cells by donating progesterone receptor binding sites to the genome. We tested the regulatory abilities of 89 TE consensus sequences and found nearly all acted as repressors in mammalian cells, but treatment with a histone deacetylase inhibitor unmasked latent enhancer functions. These data indicate TEs have played an important role in the development, evolution, and function of primate decidual stromal cells and suggest a two-step model in which latent enhancer functions of TEs are unmasked after they lose primary repressors functions.\n\nSignificance statementGene expression patterns evolved very rapidly during the evolutionary origins of pregnancy in early mammals and in primates. These episodes of gene expression evolution and linked with important processes that establish and maintain pregnancy, and appear to be driven by domestication of transposable elements.",

Methods that provide better mappings can fuel important processes such as drug discovery and disease understanding. Currently, true determination of translation initiation sites is primarily achieved by in vivo experiments. Here we propose TIS Transformer, a deep learning model for the determination of translation start sites solely utilizing the information embedded in the transcript nucleotide sequence. The method is built upon deep learning techniques first designed for natural language processing. We prove this approach to be best suited for learning the semantics of translation, outperforming previous approaches by a large margin. We demonstrate that limitations in the model performance is primarily due to the presence of low quality annotations against which the model is evaluated against. Advantages of the method are its ability to detect key features of the translation process and multiple coding sequences on a transcript. These include micropeptides encoded by short Open Reading Frames, either alongside a canonical coding sequence or within long non-coding RNAs. To demonstrate the use of our methods, we applied TIS Transformer to remap the full human proteome.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAs the housekeeping genes (HKG) generally involved in maintaining essential cell functions are typically assumed to exhibit constant expression levels across cell types, they are commonly employed as internal controls in gene expression studies. Nevertheless, HKG may vary gene expression profile according to different variables introducing systematic errors into experimental results. Sex bias can indeed affect expression display, however, up to date, sex has not been typically considered as a biological variable.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we evaluate the expression profiles of six classical housekeeping genes (four metabolic: GAPDH, HPRT, PPIA, and UBC, and two ribosomal: 18S and RPL19) to determine expression stability in adipose tissues (AT) of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus and check sex bias and their overall suitability as internal controls. We also assess the expression stability of all genes included in distinct whole-transcriptome microarrays available from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify sex-unbiased housekeeping genes (suHKG) suitable for use as internal controls. We perform a novel computational strategy based on meta-analysis techniques to identify any sexual dimorphisms in mRNA expression stability in AT and to properly validate potential candidates.\n\nResultsJust above half of the considered studies informed properly about the sex of the human samples, however, not enough female mouse samples were found to be included in this analysis. We found differences in the HKG expression stability in humans between female and male samples, with females presenting greater instability. We propose a suHKG signature including experimentally validated classical HKG like PPIA and RPL19 and novel potential markers for human AT and discarding others like the extensively used 18S gene due to a sex-based variability display in adipose tissue. Orthologs have also been assayed and proposed for mouse WAT suHKG signature. All results generated during this study are readily available by accessing an open web resource (https://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-HKG) for consultation and reuse in further studies.\n\nConclusionsThis sex-based research proves that certain classical housekeeping genes fail to function adequately as controls when analyzing human adipose tissue considering sex as a variable. We confirm RPL19 and PPIA suitability as sex-unbiased human and mouse housekeeping genes derived from sex-specific expression profiles, and propose new ones such as RPS8 and UBB.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA computational strategy based on massive data analysis revealed that an accurate experimental design for adipose tissue requires the adequate selection of a sex-unbiased housekeeping genes (HKG).\nC_LIO_LIThe extensively used 18S gene displays sex-based variability in adipose tissue, although PPIA and RPL19 do not, and hence, represent robust HKG.\nC_LIO_LINew sex-unbiased human and mouse candidate HKG: RPS8 and UBB.\nC_LIO_LImetafun-HKG (https://bioinfo.cipf.es/metafun-HKG): a freely available web tool to allow users to review stable expression levels of candidate HKG along the large volume of FAIR data.\nC_LI",

Here we report that tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate, small molecule metabolites secreted by the probiotic milk-fermented yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus inhibit hyperinflammation (e.g., \"cytokine storm\"). Comprehensive in vivo and in vitro analyses, employing LPS-induced hyperinflammation models, reveal dramatic effects of the molecules, added in tandem, on mice morbidity, laboratory parameters, and mortality. Specifically, we observed attenuated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, IL-1, IL-1{beta} and TNF-, and reduced reactive oxygen species. Importantly, tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate did not completely suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine generation, rather brought their concentrations back to baseline levels thus maintaining core immune functions, including phagocytosis. The anti-inflammatory effects of tryptophol acetate and tyrosol acetate were mediated through downregulation of TLR4, IL-1R, and TNFR signaling pathways and increased A20 expression, leading to NF-kB inhibition. Overall, this work illuminates phenomenological and molecular details underscoring anti-inflammatory properties of small molecules identified in a probiotic mixture, pointing to potential therapeutic avenues against severe inflammation.",

Intense efforts have been devoted for the development of sLeX mimetics for the prevention of atherosclerosis. By contrast, low levels of sLeX are associated with leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) disorders. In this context, we employed metabolic glycan engineering to alter the fine structures of sialoglycans. Treatment of HL-60 (human acute myeloid leukemia) cells with peracetyl N-cyclobutanoyl-D-mannosamine (Ac4ManNCb) resulted in a four-fold increase in both sLeX levels and adhesion to E-selectin-Fc chimera. Enhanced sLeX levels on CD162/PSGL-1, CD43, and CD44 were observed through immunoprecipitation. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on interactions with E-selectin revealed dramatic differentials in the conformational dynamics of sLeX-Cb compared to sLeX, highlighting the significance of remote N-acyl side chains of sialic acids in facilitating bio-active conformations.

    "abstract": "DNA viruses have a major influence on the ecology and evolution of cellular organisms, but their overall diversity and evolutionary trajectories remain elusive. Here, we performed a phylogeny-guided genome-resolved metagenomic survey of the sunlit oceans and discovered plankton-infecting relatives of herpesviruses that form a putative new phylum dubbed  Mirusviricota. The virion morphogenesis module of this large monophyletic clade is typical of viruses from the realm Duplodnaviria, with the major capsid protein fold being a likely structural intermediate between the capsid proteins of Caudoviricetes (tailed phages) and Herpesvirales (animal-infecting viruses). Yet, a substantial fraction of  Mirusviricota genes, including hallmark transcription machinery genes missing in herpesviruses, are closely related homologs of large and giant eukaryotic DNA viruses from another viral realm. The remarkable chimeric attributes of  Mirusviricota provide missing links in the evolution of both herpesviruses and giant viruses. Furthermore, mirusviruses are widespread and transcriptionally active from pole to pole, encoding complex functional traits used during the infection of microbial eukaryotes. The  Mirusviricota prevalence, functional activity, diversification, and atypical evolutionary traits point to a lasting role of mirusviruses in the ecology of marine ecosystems that might have not only predated but also contributed to the emergence of herpesviruses and giant viruses.",

We illustrate our hybrid models with growth rate predictions of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida grown in different media and with phenotype predictions of gene knocked-out Escherichia coli mutants. Our neural-mechanistic models systematically outperform constraint-based models and require training set sizes orders of magnitude smaller than classical machine learning methods. Our hybrid approach opens a doorway to enhancing constraint-based modeling: instead of constraining mechanistic models with additional experimental measurements, our hybrid models grasp the power of machine learning while fulfilling mechanistic constrains, thus saving time and resources in typical systems biology or biological engineering projects.",

In this study, we combine cortical circuit modeling with network theory to demonstrate that the sharpness of topographic projections acts as a bifurcation parameter, controlling the macroscopic dynamics and representational precision across a modular network. By shifting the balance of excitation and inhibition, topographic modularity gradually increases task performance and improves the signal-to-noise ratio across the system. We demonstrate that in biologically constrained networks, such a denoising behavior is contingent on recurrent inhibition. We show that this is a robust and generic structural feature that enables a broad range of behaviorally-relevant operating regimes, and provide an in-depth theoretical analysis unravelling the dynamical principles underlying the mechanism.",

The investigated biomarkers included a broad range of genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolic alterations, as well as established markers relevant for prognosis, molecular subtypes and clinical outcomes. Overall, we found that DL can predict multi-omic biomarkers directly from routine histology images across solid cancer types, with 50% of the models performing at an area under the curve (AUC) of more than 0.633 (with 25% of the models having an AUC larger than 0.711). A wide range of biomarkers were detectable from routine histology images across all investigated cancer types, with a mean AUC of at least 0.62 in almost all malignancies. Strikingly, we observed that biomarker predictability was mostly consistent and not dependent on sample size and class ratio, suggesting a degree of true predictability inherent in histomorphology.

    "abstract": "One hypothesis invoked to explain limits to species ranges is a mismatch in environmental conditions between the central and marginal areas of species ranges. Low population size at the margins causes genetic drift to outplay selection locally, and limits the accumulation of genetic variance, so that adaptation is hindered locally. Earlier theoretical work shows that, for a population expanding over a spatially heterogeneous environment without any geographical barriers, adaptation will fail abruptly and sharp range margins will establish only when the underlying environmental conditions change more and more severely across space, whereas an environment changing constantly will result either in infinite expansion or rapid global extinction. Here, we extend this \"steepening-gradient hypothesis\" to encompass situations when multiple (up to three) environmental factors impose selection on separate adaptive traits. We show that multiple selection gradients steepen each other and that it is sufficient that just one of the gradients steepen in space for sharp range margins to form. This is true even if this gradient is shallow throughout the realised range. Thus, despite its detrimental role in forming range margins, it could be overlooked in field studies. Finally, by decomposing an environmental gradient to selection on two (or three) adaptive traits, we show that a population can withstand harsher environmental conditions than when selection acts on one adaptive trait alone. This finding argues for the evolution of novel traits in harsh environments.",

    "abstract": "To successfully traverse their environment, humans often perform maneuvers to achieve desired task goals while simultaneously maintaining balance. Humans accomplish these tasks primarily by modulating their foot placements. As humans are more unstable laterally, we must better understand how humans modulate lateral foot placement. We previously developed a theoretical framework and corresponding computational models to describe how humans regulate lateral stepping during straight-ahead continuous walking. We identified goal functions for step width and lateral body position that define the walking task and determine the set of all possible task solutions as Goal Equivalent Manifolds (GEMs). Here, we used this framework to determine if humans can regulate lateral stepping during non-steady-state lateral maneuvers by minimizing errors consistent with these goal functions. Twenty young healthy adults each performed four lateral lane-change maneuvers in a virtual reality environment. Extending our general lateral stepping regulation framework, we first re-examined the requirements of such transient walking tasks. Doing so yielded new theoretical predictions regarding how steps during any such maneuver should be regulated to minimize error costs, consistent with the goals required at each step and with how these costs are adapted at each step during the maneuver. Humans performed the experimental lateral maneuvers in a manner consistent with our theoretical predictions. Furthermore, their stepping behavior was well modeled by allowing the parameters of our previous lateral stepping models to adapt from step to step. To our knowledge, our results are the first to demonstrate humans might use evolving cost landscapes in real time to perform such an adaptive motor task and, furthermore, that such adaptation can occur quickly - over only one step. Thus, the predictive capabilities of our general stepping regulation framework extend to a much greater range of walking tasks beyond just normal, straight-ahead walking.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYWhen we walk in the real world, we rarely walk continuously in a straight line. Indeed, we regularly have to perform other tasks like stepping aside to avoid an obstacle in our path (either fixed or moving, like another person coming towards us). While we have to be highly maneuverable to accomplish such tasks, we must also maintain balance to avoid falling while doing so. This is challenging because walking humans are inherently more unstable side-to-side. Sideways falls are particularly dangerous for older adults as they can lead to hip fractures. Here, we establish a theoretical basis for how people might accomplish such maneuvers. We show that humans execute a simple lateral lane-change maneuver consistent with our theoretical predictions. Importantly, our simulations show they can do so by adapting at each step the same step-to-step regulation strategies they use to walk straight ahead. Moreover, these same control processes also explain how humans trade-off side-to-side stability to gain the maneuverability they need to perform such lateral maneuvers.",

Novel antibodies with high affinity and better therapeutic properties are needed. In the current study, we have isolated and characterized a novel VH domain 3C9 from a large size human immunoglobulin heavy chain variable (VH) domain library. 3C9 exhibited high affinity [KD (dissociation constant) < 3 nM] and binding specificity in a membrane proteome array (MPA). In a mouse xenograft model, 3C9 fused to human Fc became visible at tumor sites as early as 8 hours post infusion and persisted at the tumor site for more than 10 days. Both CAR-T cells and antibody domain drug conjugations (DDCs) generated with 3C9 were highly effective at killing MSLN positive cells in vitro without off-target effects. The X-ray crystal structure of full-length MSLN in complex with 3C9 reveals interaction of the 3C9 domains with two distinctive residues patches on the MSLN surface. 3C9 fused to human Fc domain drug conjugate was efficacious to inhibit tumor growth in a mouse xenograft model. This newly discovered VH antibody domain holds promise as a therapeutic candidate for MSLN-expressing cancers.",

PV+ interneuron axons are partially myelinated but the electrical and metabolic roles of myelin in axonal functions remain poorly understood. Here, we developed Cre-dependent AAV vectors for cell type-specific investigation of mitochondria with genetically encoded fluorescent probes. Single-cell reconstructions and mining of ultrastructural data revealed that mitochondria selectively cluster to myelinated segments of PV+ basket cell axons. Cuprizone-induced demyelination abolished mitochondrial clustering in PV+ axons but increased axonal mitochondrial densities in excitatory axons. The internodal clustering of mitochondria was preserved with genetic deletion of myelin basic protein, suggesting that noncompacted myelin is sufficient. Finally, two-photon imaging of action potential-evoked mitochondrial calcium (mt-Ca2+) responses showed that internodal mitochondria did not contribute in buffering activity-dependent Ca2+ influx. These findings suggest that oligodendrocyte-PV+ axon signaling assembles mitochondria to branch selectively fine-tune metabolic demands.",

    "abstract": "The bacterial endosymbiont Wolbachia is best known for its ability to modify its hosts reproduction by inducing cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) to facilitate its own spread. Classical models predict either near-fixation of costly Wolbachia once the symbiont has overcome a threshold frequency (invasion barrier), or Wolbachia extinction if the barrier is not overcome. However, natural populations do not all follow this pattern: Wolbachia can also be found at low frequencies (below one half) that appear stable over time. Wolbachia is known to have pleiotropic fitness effects (beyond CI) on its hosts. Existing models typically focus on the possibility that these are negative. Here we consider the possibility that the symbiont provides direct benefits to infected females (e.g. resistance to pathogens) in addition to CI. We discuss an underappreciated feature of Wolbachia dynamics: that CI with additional fitness benefits can produce low-frequency (< 1/2) stable equilibria. Additionally, without a direct positive fitness effect, any stable equilibrium close to one half will be sensitive to perturbations, which make such equilibria unlikely to sustain in nature. The results hold for both diplodiploid and different haplodiploid versions of CI. We suggest that insect populations showing low-frequency Wolbachia infection might host CI-inducing symbiotic strains providing additional (hidden or known) benefits to their hosts, especially when classical explanations (ongoing invasion, source-sink dynamics) have been ruled out.",

    "abstract": "Under the ecological speciation model, divergent selection acts on ecological differences between populations, gradually creating barriers to gene flow and ultimately leading to reproductive isolation. Hybridisation is part of this continuum and can both promote and inhibit the speciation process. Here, we used white-tailed (Odocoileus virginianus) and mule deer (O. hemionus) to investigate patterns of speciation in hybridising sister species. We quantified genome-wide historical introgression and performed genome scans to look for signatures of four different selection scenarios. Despite ample modern evidence of hybridisation, we found negligible patterns of ancestral introgression and no signatures of divergence with gene flow, rather localised patterns of allopatric and balancing selection were detected across the genome. Genes under balancing selection were related to immunity, MHC and sensory perception of smell, the latter of which is consistent with deer biology. The deficiency of historical gene-flow suggests that white-tailed and mule deer were spatially separated during the glaciation cycles of the Pleistocene and genome wide differentiation accrued via genetic drift. Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities and selection against hybrids are hypothesised to be acting, and diversity correlations to recombination rates suggests these sister species are far along the speciation continuum.",

Features such as heterogeneous f-I curves and spike frequency adaptation are known to place single neurons in optimal coding regimes when facing changing stimuli. Yet, it is still unclear how brain circuits exploit single-neuron flexibility, and how network-level requirements may have shaped such cellular function. To answer this question, a multi-scaled approach is needed where the computations of single neurons and neural circuits must be considered as a complete system. In this work, we use artificial neural networks to systematically investigate single-neuron input-output adaptive mechanisms, optimized in an end-to-end fashion. Throughout the optimization process, each neuron has the liberty to modify its nonlinear activation function, parametrized to mimic f-I curves of biological neurons, and to learn adaptation strategies to modify activation functions in real-time during a task. We find that such networks show much-improved robustness to noise and changes in input statistics. Importantly, we find that this procedure recovers precise coding strategies found in biological neurons, such as gain scaling and fractional order differentiation/integration. Using tools from dynamical systems theory, we analyze the role of these emergent single-neuron properties and argue that neural diversity and adaptation play an active regularization role, enabling neural circuits to optimally propagate information across time.",

    "abstract": "Memory consolidation processes have traditionally been investigated from the perspective of hours or days. However, the latest developments in memory research showed that memory consolidation processes could occur even within seconds, possibly due to the neural replay of just-practiced memory traces during short breaks. Here, we investigate this rapid form of consolidation during statistical learning. We aim to answer (a) whether this rapid consolidation occurs in implicit statistical learning and general skill learning and (b) whether the duration of rest periods affects these two learning types differently. Participants performed a widely used statistical learning task - the Alternating Serial Reaction Time (ASRT) task - that enables us to measure implicit statistical and general skill learning separately. The ASRT task consisted of 25 learning blocks with a rest period between the blocks. In a between-subjects design, the length of the rest periods was fixed at 15 or 30 seconds, or the participants could control the length themselves. We found that the duration of rest periods does not affect the amount of statistical knowledge acquired but does change the dynamics of learning. Shorter rest periods led to better learning during the learning blocks, whereas longer rest periods promoted learning also in the between block rest periods, possibly due to the higher amount of replay. Moreover, we found weaker general skill learning in the self-paced group than in the fixed rest period groups. These results suggest that distinct learning processes are differently affected by the duration of short rest periods.",

We applied brain-wide tractography to diffusion images from 30,810 adult participants (UK Biobank), and found significant heritability for 90 regional connectivity measures and 851 tract-wise connectivity measures. Multivariate genome-wide association analyses identified 355 independently associated lead SNPs across the genome, of which 77% had not been previously associated with human brain metrics. Enrichment analyses implicated neurodevelopmental processes including neurogenesis, neural differentiation, neural migration, neural projection guidance, and axon development, as well as prenatal brain expression especially in stem cells, astrocytes, microglia and neurons. We used the multivariate association profiles of lead SNPs to identify 26 genomic loci implicated in structural connectivity between core regions of the left-hemisphere language network, and also identified 6 loci associated with hemispheric left-right asymmetry of structural connectivity. Polygenic scores for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, left-handedness, Alzheimers disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and epilepsy showed significant multivariate associations with structural connectivity, each implicating distinct sets of brain regions with trait-relevant functional profiles.

Therefore, life history and the mutation rate coevolve, but this coevolution is not well understood. We develop a mathematical model to analyse the evolution of resource allocation traits, which simultaneously affect life history and the deleterious mutation rate. First, we show that the invasion fitness of such resource allocation traits can be approximated by the basic reproductive number of the least-loaded class; the expected lifetime production of offspring without deleterious mutations born to individuals without deleterious mutations. Second, we apply the model to investigate (i) the coevolution of reproductive effort and germline maintenance and (ii) the coevolution of age-at-maturity and germline maintenance. This analysis provides two resource allocation predictions when exposure to environmental mutagens is higher. First, selection favours higher allocation to germline maintenance, even if it comes at the expense of life history functions, and leads to a shift in allocation towards reproduction rather than survival. Second, life histories tend to be faster, characterized by individuals with shorter lifespans and smaller body sizes at maturity. Our results suggest that mutation accumulation via the cost of germline maintenance can be a major force shaping life-history traits.",

    "abstract": "A central challenge in every field of biology is to use existing measurements to predict the outcomes of future experiments. In this work, we consider the wealth of antibody inhibition data against variants of the influenza virus. Due to this viruss genetic diversity and evolvability, the variants examined in one study will often have little-to-no overlap with other studies, making it difficult to discern common patterns or unify datasets for further analysis. To that end, we develop a computational framework that predicts how an antibody or serum would inhibit any variant from any other study. We use this framework to greatly expand seven influenza datasets utilizing hemagglutination inhibition, validating our method upon 200,000 existing measurements and predicting 2,000,000 new values {+/-} uncertainties. With these new values, we quantify the transferability between seven vaccination and infection studies in humans and ferrets, show that the serum potency is negatively correlated with breadth, and present a tool for pandemic preparedness. This data-driven approach does not require any information beyond each viruss name and measurements, and even datasets with as few as 5 viruses can be expanded, making this approach widely applicable. Future influenza studies using hemagglutination inhibition can directly utilize our curated datasets to predict newly measured antibody responses against {approx}80 H3N2 influenza viruses from 1968-2011, whereas immunological studies utilizing other viruses or a different assay only need a single partially-overlapping dataset to extend their work.

    "abstract": "Modern sequencing technologies are not error-free, and might have elevated error rates at some locations of the genome. A potential cause for such elevated error rates is the formation of alternative DNA structures (non-B DNA), such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), Z-DNA, or cruciform structures, during sequencing. Approximately 13% of the human genome has the potential to form such structures, which have been previously shown to affect the activity of DNA polymerases and helicases. Here we tested whether motifs with the potential to form non-B DNA (non-B motifs) influence the sequencing success of three major sequencing technologies--Illumina, Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) HiFi, and Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT). We estimated sequencing success by computing the rates of single-nucleotide, insertion, and deletion errors, as well as by evaluating mean read depth and mean base quality. Overall, all technologies exhibited altered sequencing success for most non-B motif types. Single-nucleotide error rates were generally increased for G-quadruplexes (G4s) and Z-DNA motifs in all three technologies. Illumina and PacBio HiFi deletion error rates were also increased for all non-B types except for Z-DNA motifs, while in ONT they were increased substantially only for G4 motifs. Insertion error rates for non-B motifs were highly elevated in Illumina, moderately elevated in PacBio HiFi, and only slightly elevated in ONT. Using Poisson regression modeling, we evaluated how non-B DNA motifs and other factors influence sequencing error profiles. Using the error rates at non-B motifs, we developed a probabilistic approach to determine the number of false-positive single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in different sample size and variant frequency cutoff scenarios, as well as in previously generated sequencing data sets (1000Genomes, Simons Genome Diversity Project, and gnomAD). Overall, the effect of non-B DNA on sequencing should be considered in downstream analyses, particularly in studies with limited read depth--e.g., single-cell and ancient DNA sequencing, as well as sequencing of pooled population samples--and when scoring variants with low frequency (e.g., singletons). Because each sequencing technology analyzed has a unique error profile at non-B motifs, a combination of different technologies should be considered in future sequencing studies of such motifs, to maximize accuracy.",

This association was stronger than T cell expansion, a putative indicator of antigen-specific T cells. By using flow sorted tetramer+ single T cell data, we discovered that convergent T cells were enriched for a neoantigen-specific CD8+ effector phenotype in the tumor microenvironment.

    "abstract": "Genomic instability is a hallmark of cancer, resulting in tumor genomes having large numbers of genetic aberrations, including homozygous deletions of protein coding genes. That tumor cells remain viable in the presence of such gene loss suggests high robustness to genetic perturbation. In model organisms and cancer cell lines, paralogs have been shown to contribute substantially to genetic robustness - they are generally more dispensable for growth than singletons. Here, by analyzing copy number profiles of >10,000 tumors, we test the hypothesis that the increased dispensability of paralogs shapes tumor genome evolution. We find that genes with paralogs are more likely to be homozygously deleted and that this cannot be explained by other factors known to influence copy number variation. Furthermore, features that influence paralog dispensability in cancer cell lines correlate with paralog deletion frequency in tumors. Finally, paralogs that are broadly essential in cancer cell lines are less frequently deleted in tumors than non-essential paralogs. Overall our results suggest that homozygous deletions of paralogs are more frequently observed in tumor genomes because paralogs are more dispensable.",

Stomatal number, size and aperture are key determinants of plant transpiration and photosynthesis, and variation in these traits can affect plant growth and productivity. Current methods to screen for stomatal phenotypes are tedious and not high throughput. This impedes research on stomatal biology and hinders efforts to develop resilient crops with optimised stomatal patterning. We have developed a rapid non-destructive method to phenotype stomatal traits in four species: wheat, rice, tomato and Arabidopsis.\n\nResultsThe method consists of two steps. The first is the non-destructive capture of images of the leaf surface from plants in their growing environment using a handheld microscope; a process which only takes a few seconds compared to minutes for other methods. The second is to analyse stomatal features using a machine learning model that automatically detects, counts and measures stomatal number, size and aperture. The accuracy of the machine learning model in detecting stomata ranged from 76% to 99%, depending on the species, with a high correlation between measures of number, size and aperture between measurements using the machine learning models and by measuring them manually. The rapid method was applied to quickly identify contrasting stomatal phenotypes.\n\nConclusionsWe developed a method that combines rapid non-destructive imaging of leaf surfaces with automated image analysis. The method provides accurate data on stomatal features while significantly reducing time for data acquisition and analysis. It can be readily used to phenotype stomata in large populations in the field and in controlled environments.",

Empirical data transformed into significant digits reveal statistical correspondence between the discrete Benford probability distribution and physical systems in dynamic equilibrium along a continuum of stability. Analytic methods are presented to detect this mathematical representation across multiple levels of ecological organization and spatial scale. Case studies demonstrate novel application to help identify bidirectional regime changes to alternative states of dynamic equilibrium. Widespread documentation of the surprising phenomenon is anticipated as ecologists revisit historic sets of random measurement data and design future sampling protocols.

    "abstract": "Candidatus Methanophagales (ANME-1) is a major order-level clade of archaea responsible for methane removal in deep-sea sediments through the anaerobic oxidation of methane. Yet the extent of their diversity and factors which drive their dynamics and evolution remain poorly understood. Here, by sampling hydrothermal rocks and sediments, we expand their phylogenetic diversity and characterize a new deep-branching, thermophilic ANME-1 family,  Candidatus Methanospirareceae (ANME-1c). They are phylogenetically closest to the short-chain-alkane oxidizers  Candidatus Syntrophoarchaeales and  Candidatus Alkanophagales, and encode ancestral features including a methyl coenzyme M reductase chaperone McrD and a hydrogenase complex. Global phylogeny and near-complete genomes clarified that the debated hydrogen metabolism within ANME-1 is an ancient trait that was vertically inherited but differentially lost during lineage diversification. Our expanded genomic and metagenomic sampling allowed the discovery of viruses constituting 3 new orders and 16 new families that so far are exclusive to ANME-1 hosts. These viruses represent 4 major archaeal virus assemblages, characterized by tailless icosahedral, head-tailed, rod-shaped, and spindle-shaped virions, but display unique structural and replicative signatures. Exemplified by the analyses of thymidylate synthases that unveiled a virus-mediated ancestral process of host gene displacement, this expansive ANME-1 virome carries a large gene repertoire that can influence their hosts across different timescales. Our study thus puts forth an emerging evolutionary continuum between anaerobic methane and short-chain-alkane oxidizers and opens doors for exploring the impacts of viruses on the dynamics and evolution of the anaerobic methane-driven ecosystems.",

Across diffusion magnetic resonance images from individuals in the UK Biobank, Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and Developing Human Connectome Project, we find that targeted attack procedures on increasing white matter tract lengths and densities are remarkably invariant to aging and disease. Time-reversing the attack computation suggests a mechanism for how brains develop, for which we derive an analytical equation using percolation theory. Based on a close match between theory and experiment, our results demonstrate that tracts are limited to emanate from regions already in the giant cluster and tracts that appear earliest in neurodevelopment are those that become the longest and densest.\n\nSignificanceAs brains develop through neural growth and specialization, what mechanism ensures that new neurons are integrated into a fully connected brain, avoiding \"bridges to nowhere\"? Here, we study brain structure development from the perspective of percolation, a global measure of communication. Analyzing over 35,000 diffusion MRI scans on human individuals, from newborns to adults, we identify the following rules of brain neurogenesis through percolation theory: earlier tracts become longer and denser while maintaining a giant cluster. This signature, invariant to age or mental health, suggests a fundamental condition for the brain to function as an emergent whole.",

Clock misalignment can lead to various pathologies including obesity and diabetes, both of which are associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma - a devastating cancer with an 80% five-year mortality rate. Although circadian desynchrony is associated with an increased risk of several solid-organ cancers, the correlation between clock misalignment and pancreas cancer is unclear. Using a chronic jetlag model, we investigated the impact of clock misalignment on pancreas cancer initiation in mice harboring a pancreas-specific activated Kras mutation. We found that chronic jetlag accelerated the development of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions, with a concomitant increase in precursor lesion grade. Cell-autonomous knock-out of the clock in pancreatic epithelial cells of Kras-mutant mice demonstrated no acceleration of precursor lesion formation, indicating non-cell-autonomous clock dysfunction was responsible for the expedited tumor development. Therefore, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing over time and identified fibroblasts as the cell population manifesting the greatest clock-dependent changes, with enrichment of specific cancer-associated fibroblast pathways due to circadian misalignment. Collectively, these results suggest fibroblasts as the putative target of chronic jetlag-induced accelerated pancreas cancer initiation.",

    "abstract": "Open-source, publicly available neuroimaging datasets--whether from large-scale data collection efforts or pooled from multiple smaller studies--offer unprecedented sample sizes and promote generalization efforts. Releasing data can democratize science, increase the replicability of findings, and lead to discoveries. Due to patient privacy and data storage concerns, researchers typically release preprocessed data with the voxelwise time series parcellated into a map of predefined regions, known as an atlas. However, releasing preprocessed data also limits the choices available to the end-user. This is especially true for connectomics, as connectomes created from different atlases are not directly comparable. Since there exist several atlases with no gold standards, it is unrealistic to have processed, open-source data available from all atlases. Together, these limitations directly inhibit the potential benefits of open-source neuroimaging data. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross Atlas Remapping via Optimal Transport (CAROT) to find a mapping between two atlases. This approach allows data processed from one atlas to be directly transformed into a connectome based on another atlas without the need for raw data access. To validate CAROT, we compare reconstructed connectomes against their original counterparts (i.e., connectomes generated directly from an atlas), demonstrate the utility of transformed connectomes in downstream analyses, and show how a connectome-based predictive model can generalize to publicly available data that was processed with different atlases. Overall, CAROT can reconstruct connectomes from an extensive set of atlases--without ever needing the raw data--allowing already processed connectomes to be easily reused in a wide range of analyses while eliminating redundant processing efforts. We share this tool as both source code and as a stand-alone web application (http://carotproject.com/).",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWDeciphering the genetic bases of behavioural traits is essential to understanding how they evolve and contribute to adaptation and biological diversification, but it remains a substantial challenge, especially for behavioural traits with polygenic architectures. In this study, we developed a population genomics approach coupled with functional predictions to address the evolution and genetic basis of olfactory-based assortative mate preferences in the house mouse, suspected to have evolved as a response to selection against hybridisation. We used whole genome resequencing data and the C2 statistic of the program BO_SCPLOWAYC_SCPLOWPO_SCPLOWASSC_SCPLOW, which contrasts allele frequencies corrected for population structure, to characterize genetic differentiation between sets of populations with strong contrast in behaviour (expressing or not assortative mate preferences) and we identified some regions of the genome showing the expected significant and consistent association with behavioural divergence. A series of Olfactory and Vomeronasal Receptor genes, among the most differentiated genomic regions and in line with functional predictions, stand out as the prime candidates underlying this olfactory-based behavioural divergence. These genes form large gene clusters in the genome, with two main candidate clusters extending up to 1.8 Mb. Variant analyses indicate a potential dual role of regulatory and protein-coding changes in the evolution of choosiness. This study shows that combining expectations on the genomic patterns of divergence with functional expectations represents a promising route to unravelling the genetic architecture of complex trait variation and provides novel insights into the role of olfactory and vomeronasal receptors in mammal adaptation and speciation.",

    "abstract": "Full-length transcript sequencing remains a main goal of RNA sequencing. However, even the application of long-read sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore Technologies still fail to yield full-length transcript sequencing for a significant portion of sequenced reads. Since these technologies can sequence reads that are far longer than the longest known processed transcripts, the lack of efficiency to obtain full-length transcripts from good quality RNAs stems from library preparation inefficiency rather than the presence of degraded RNA molecules. It has previously been shown that addition of inverted terminal repeats in cDNA during reverse transcription followed by single-primer PCR creates a PCR suppression effect that prevents amplification of short molecules thus enriching the library for longer transcripts. We adapted this method for Nanopore cDNA library preparation and show that not only is PCR efficiency increased but gene body coverage is dramatically improved. The results show that implementation of this simple strategy will result in better quality full-length RNA sequencing data and make full-length transcript sequencing possible for most of sequenced reads.\n\nContribution to the fieldLong-read RNA sequencing aims to sequence expressed transcripts in their entirety. However, this has remained a challenge, mainly due to inherent inefficiencies in cDNA library preparation. Herein, we provide a new Nanopore cDNA library preparation protocol, termed Panhandle, that improves the efficiency of cDNA PCR with yields 2 - 8 times the yields obtained with ordinary PCR. This is key, as this should in turn reflect in the possibility of lowering the number of PCR cycles needed to obtain ample sequencing material, which in turn could reduce PCR biases, PCR artifacts, turnaround time, reagents, and could increase general quality of the library. Further, transcripts generated using the Panhandle method show better gene body coverage and more accurate transcription start site mapping than regular methods. This represents an important step towards full-length cDNA sequencing by Nanopore.",

    "abstract": "Fast prediction of mode of action for bioactive compounds would immensely foster bioactivity annotation in compound collections and may early on reveal off-targets in chemical biology research and drug discovery. A variety of target-based assays is available for addressing the modulation of druggable proteins. However, they cannot precisely predict how a compound would influence cellular processes due to polypharmacology. Furthermore, non-protein targets are often not considered. Morphological profiling, e.g., using the Cell Painting assay that monitors hundreds of morphological features upon compound perturbation and staining of cellular components, offers a fast, unbiased assessment of compound activity on various targets and cellular processes in one single experiment. However, due to incomplete bioactivity annotation and unknown activities of reference (landmark) compounds, prediction of bioactivity is not straightforward. Here we introduce the concept of subprofile analysis to map the mode of action for both reference and unexplored compounds. We defined mode-of-action clusters for a group of reference compounds and extracted cluster subprofiles that contain only a subset of morphological features (i.e., subprofiles) to represent a consensus profile. Subprofile analysis allows for assignment of compounds to, currently, ten different targets or modes of action in one single assay and bypasses the need of exploring all biosimilar reference compounds for the generation of target hypothesis. This approach will enable rapid bioactivity annotation of compound collections, particularly of uncharacterized small molecules, and will be extended to further bioactivity clusters in future.

Previous analyses of mouse cerebella3,4 or human counterparts from frozen tissue nuclei5 have not fully defined the compositional heterogeneity of MBs. Here, we undertook an unprecedented single-cell profiling of freshly-isolated human fetal cerebella to establish a reference map delineating hierarchical cellular states in MBs. We identified a unique transitional cerebellar progenitor connecting neural stem cells to neuronal lineages in developing fetal cerebella. Intersectional analysis revealed that the transitional progenitors were enriched in aggressive MB subgroups, including group-3 and metastatic tumors. Single-cell multi-omics revealed underlying regulatory networks in the transitional progenitor populations, including transcriptional determinants HNRNPH1 and SOX11, which are correlated with clinical prognosis in group-3 MBs. Genomic and Hi-C profiling identified de novo long-range chromatin-loops juxtaposing HNRNPH1/SOX11-targeted super-enhancers to cis-regulatory elements of MYC, an oncogenic driver for group-3 MBs. Targeting the transitional progenitor regulators inhibited MYC expression and MYC-driven group-3 MB growth. Our integrated single-cell atlases of human fetal cerebella and MBs reveal potential cell populations predisposed to transformation and regulatory circuitries underlying tumor cell states and oncogenesis, highlighting hitherto unrecognized transitional progenitor intermediates predictive of disease prognosis and potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.",

To determine how FRET-sensor can be employed for the study of switchable allosteric modulator proteins (SAMPs) I extend a previously established model for enzymatic SAMPs to include a FRET-sensor system. Using this model, I determine the prerequisites for using FRET to investigate modulator-regulator interaction. The model shows, that under saturating stimulus conditions only a trimolecular complex contributes to the measured FRET value. How the signal is relayed by the modulator can be investigated by comparing FRET values of unstimulated and signal-saturated sensor systems. Finally, to determine the allosteric mode of signal transduction the natural logarithm of the ratio of stimulated and unstimulated FRET efficiencies is a useful metric.",

Since adolescence is a time when mood disorder onset peaks, mood variability during this time is of significant interest. Understanding biological factors that might be associated with mood variability, such as sleep and structural brain development, could elucidate the mechanisms underlying mood and anxiety disorders. Data from the longitudinal Leiden Self-Concept study (N=171) over 5 yearly timepoints was used to study the association between sleep, brain structure, and mood variability in healthy adolescents aged 11-21 at baseline in this pre-registered study. Sleep was measured both objectively, using actigraphy, as well as subjectively, using a daily diary self-report. Negative mood variability was defined as day-to-day negative mood swings over a period of 5 days after an MRI scan. It was found that negative mood variability peaked in mid-adolescence in females while it linearly increased in males, and average negative mood showed a similar pattern. Sleep duration (subjective and objective) generally decreased throughout adolescence, with a larger decrease in males. Mood variability was not associated with sleep, but average negative mood was associated with lower self-reported energy. In addition, higher thickness in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) compared to same-age peers, suggesting a delayed thinning process, was associated with higher negative mood variability in early and mid-adolescence. Together, this study provides an insight into the development of mood variability and its association with brain structure.",

Here we report that defective cystine mobilization from lysosomes through cystinosin (CTNS), which is mutated in cystinosis, diverts PT cells towards growth and proliferation, disrupting their functions. Mechanistically, cystine storage stimulates Ragulator-Rag GTPase-dependent recruitment of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and its constitutive activation. Re-introduction of CTNS restores nutrient-dependent regulation of mTORC1 in knockout cells, whereas cell-permeant analogues of L-cystine, accumulating within lysosomes, render wild-type cells resistant to nutrient withdrawal. Therapeutic mTORC1 inhibition corrects lysosome and differentiation downstream of cystine storage, and phenotypes in a zebrafish model of cystinosis. Thus, cystine serves as a lysosomal signal that tailors mTORC1 and metabolism to direct epithelial cell fate decisions. These results identify mechanisms and therapeutic targets for dysregulated homeostasis in cystinosis.",

    "abstract": "Integration of positional information across body axes is likely critical for whole-body regeneration to define the territories of missing tissue in three dimensions with fidelity. The body-wall musculature in planarians expresses patterning factors regulating the anteroposterior, dorsoventral, and mediolateral axes, but how this information coordinates is not fully understood. We identify a previously described factor specifically expressed in dorsal midline muscle as a BMP/Activin decoy receptor bambi-2. Analysis of scRNAseq indicates bambi-2+ cells coexpress midline-specifying transcription factor pitx and longitudinal muscle-specifying factor myoD, and production of bambi-2+ cells requires these factors. In laterally amputated animals regenerating an entirely new midline, bambi-2+ cells are initially formed at the wound site, then dynamically spread, and ultimately reset to restore bilateral symmetry. We further identify a system of dorsoventral Netrin and Netrin receptor signals expressed from body-wall muscle that control midline identity and blastema morphology. Ventral and laterally expressed netrins -1, -4, and -5 signal via dorsally-enriched netrin repulsion receptors unc5-C, unc5-E, and dcc-2, which together limit mediolateral spread of bambi-2+ dorsal midline muscle and influence the architecture of the muscle system. Our results suggest a model in which ventral determinants dictate mediolateral information important for blastema morphology.",

    "abstract": "The power-duration relationship describes the time to exhaustion for exercise at different intensities. It is generally believed to be a \"fundamental bioenergetic property of living systems\" that this relationship is hyperbolic. Indeed, the hyperbolic (a.k.a. critical-power) model which formalises this belief is the dominant tool for describing and predicting high-intensity exercise performance, e.g. in cycling, running, rowing, or swimming. However, the hyperbolic model is now the focus of two heated debates in the literature because: (a) it unrealistically represents efforts that are short (< 2 minutes) or long (> 15 minutes); (b) it contradicts widely-used performance predictors such as the so-called functional threshold power (FTP) in cycling. We contribute to both debates by demonstrating that the power-duration relationship is more adequately represented by an alternative, power-law model. In particular, we show that the often observed good fit of the hyperbolic model between 2 and 15 minutes should not be taken as proof that the power-duration relationship is hyperbolic. Rather, in this range, a hyperbolic function just happens to approximate a power law fairly well. We also prove mathematical results which suggest that the power-law model is a safer tool for pace selection than the hyperbolic model and that the former better models fatigue than the latter. Finally, we use the power-law model to shed light on popular performance predictors in cycling, running and rowing such as FTP and Jack Daniels \"VDOT\" calculator.",

The adipogenesis-enhancing effect of bisphenols may explain the link between human exposure and metabolic disease; however, underlying molecular pathways remain unresolved.\n\nResultsExposure to BPS, BPF, BPA or ROS generators enhanced lipid droplet formation and expression of adipogenic markers after induction of differentiation in adipose-derived progenitors isolated from mice. RNAseq analysis in BPS-exposed progenitors revealed modulation in pathways regulating adipogenesis and responses to oxidative stress. ROS was higher in bisphenol-exposed cells, while co-treatment with antioxidants attenuated adipogenesis and abolished the effect of BPS. There was a loss of mitochondria membrane potential in BPS-exposed cells and mitochondria-derived ROS contributed to potentiation of adipogenesis by BPS and its analogues. Male mice exposed to BPS during gestation had higher whole-body adiposity, as measured by TD-NMR, while postnatal exposure had no impact on adiposity in either sex.\n\nInnovationThese findings support existing evidence showing a role for ROS in regulating adipocyte differentiation and are the first to highlight ROS as a unifying mechanism that explains the pro-adipogenic properties of BPA and its structural analogues.\n\nConclusionROS act as signaling molecules in the regulation of adipocyte differentiation and mediate bisphenol-induced potentiation of adipogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Abstract/SummaryThe central auditory system is comprised of multiple subcortical brain structures that hierarchically process and refine incoming acoustic signals along the primary auditory pathway. Due to the technical limitations of imaging small structures deep inside the brain, most of our knowledge of the subcortical auditory system is based on research in animal models using invasive methodologies. Advances in ultra-high field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisition have enabled novel non-invasive investigations of the human auditory subcortex, including fundamental features of auditory representation such as tonotopy and periodotopy. However, functional connectivity across subcortical networks is still underexplored, with ongoing development of functional connectivity methods. Traditionally, functional connectivity using fMRI data is estimated with simple correlation matrices. Partial correlations however reveal the connectivity between two regions after removing the effects of all other regions and hence are often more meaningful. Partial correlation analysis is particularly promising in the subcortical auditory system, where sensory information is passed serially, in an obligatory manner, from nucleus to nucleus up the primary auditory pathway, providing redundant but also increasingly abstract representations of auditory stimuli (Chechik and Nelken, 2012). In this project, we adapted a Gaussian copula graphical model (GCGM) approach to estimate the partial correlations and thereby infer the functional connectivity patterns within the auditory system. Given the paucity of non-invasive methods for human subcortical investigations, we aim to provide novel insights regarding the hierarchy and direct connections throughout the human subcortical auditory system. Our results show strong positive partial correlations between contralateral structures throughout the auditory system, particularly in the auditory midbrain and thalamus. We also found positive partial correlations between successive structures in the auditory pathway on each side (left and right), including between auditory midbrain and thalamus, and between primary and associative auditory cortex. Further, we confirmed that these connectivity estimates were unique to the auditory system, as non-auditory regions included as controls--namely, visual cortex and superior frontal cortex--were strongly connected to their contralateral homologues but only minimally connected with auditory brain regions. Additionally, these results were highly stable when splitting the data in half according to the acquisition schemes and computing partial correlations separately for each half of the data, as well as across cross-validation folds. Overall, these results demonstrate that unique functional connectivity patterns along the auditory pathway are recoverable using novel connectivity approaches and that our connectivity methods are reliable across multiple acquisitions.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation grant NSF DMS-1953712 (to AS and BC) and the National Institutes of Health/National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (K01DC019421 to KRS and R01DC01550 to BC).",

    "abstract": "The highly-conserved stomatin domain has been identified in genes throughout all classes of life. In animals, different stomatin domain-encoding genes have been implicated in the function of the kidney, red blood cells, and specific neuron types, though the underlying mechanisms remain unresolved. In one well-studied example of stomatin domain gene function, the C. elegans gene mec-2 and its mouse homologue Stoml3 are required for the function of mechanosensory neurons, where they modulate the activity of mechanosensory ion channels on the plasma membrane. Here we identify an additional shared function for mec-2 and Stoml3 in a very different sensory context, that of olfaction. In worms, we find that a subset of stomatin domain genes are expressed in olfactory neurons, but only mec-2 is strongly required for olfactory behavior. mec-2 acts cell-autonomously and does not have any observable effect on olfactory neuron development or morphology, but modestly reduces olfactory neuron activity. We generate a Stoml3 knockout mouse and demonstrate that, like its worm homologue mec-2, it is required for olfactory behavior. In mice, Stoml3 is not required for odor detection, but is required for odor discrimination. Therefore, in addition to their shared roles in mechanosensory behavior, mec-2 and Stoml3 also have a shared role in olfactory behavior.",

The phenomenon of covert inner speech implies a functional independence of speech content and motor production. However, it remains unclear how a flexible mapping between speech content and production is achieved on the neural level. To address this, we recorded magnetoencephalography (MEG) in humans performing a rule-based vocalization task. On each trial, vocalization content (one of two vowels) and production form (overt or covert) were instructed independently. Using multivariate pattern analysis, we found robust neural information about vocalization content and production, mostly originating from speech areas of the left hemisphere. Production signals dynamically transformed upon presentation of the content cue, whereas content signals remained largely stable throughout the trial. In sum, our results show dissociable neural representations of vocalization content and production in the human brain and provide new insights into the neural dynamics underlying human vocalization.",

Here, we conduct large-scale phylogenomic analysis of freshwater, brackish, and marine quality-filtered metagenome-assembled genomes (11,276 MAGs). Average nucleotide identity analyses showed that bacterial species rarely existed in multiple biomes. Distinct brackish basins co-hosted numerous species despite differences in salinity and geographic distance, the latter having stronger intra-species population structuring effects. We further identified the most recent cross-biome transitions, which were rare, ancient, and most commonly directed towards the brackish biome. Transitions were accompanied by changes in isoelectric point distribution and amino acid composition of inferred proteomes, as well as convergent gains or losses of specific gene functions. Therefore, adaptive challenges entailing proteome reorganization and specific changes in gene content result in species-level separation between aquatic biomes.",

    "abstract": "Regulated protein clearance is vital for cells to maintain protein homeostasis and the conditions essential for survival. The primary machinery for intracellular protein degradation is the ubiquitin- proteasome system (UPS), by which ubiquitin-tagged proteins are degraded by the proteasome. Proteasomes are present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, but the mechanisms coordinating proteasome activity and its subcellular localization in a multicellular organism are still unclear. Here, we identified the nuclear protein-encoding gene akir-1 as a proteasome regulator in a genome-wide Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) RNAi screen. We show that the depletion of akir-1 causes accumulation of endogenous polyubiquitinated proteins in the nuclei of intestinal cells, concomitant with slower in vivo proteasomal degradation in this subcellular compartment. Remarkably, the loss of akir-1 does not induce an accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins in oocyte nuclei, though akir-1 is essential for the nuclear localization of proteasomes in both cell types. We further show that the importin family member ima-3 genetically interacts with akir-1, and affects subcellular distribution of polyubiquitinated proteins in intestinal cells. We show for the first time that conserved AKIR-1 is important for the nuclear transport of proteasomes in a multicellular organism, suggesting a role for AKIR-1 in the maintenance of proteostasis.",

In parasites, we might expect the effective population size to be proportional to host population size and host body size, because both are expected to increase the number of parasite individuals. However, among other factors, parasite populations are sometimes so extremely subdivided that high levels of inbreeding may distort these predicted relationships. Here, we used whole-genome sequence data from dove parasites (71 feather louse species of the genus Columbicola) and phylogenetic comparative methods to study the relationship between parasite effective population size and host population size and body size.We found that parasite effective population size is largely explained by host body size but not host population size. These results suggest the potential local population size (infrapopulation or deme size) is more predictive of the long-term effective population size of parasites than is the total number of potential parasite infrapopulations (i.e., host individuals).\n\nImpact SummaryParasites, among Earths most diverse, threatened, and under-protected animals, play a central role in ecosystem function. The effective population size (Ne) of an organism has a profound impact on evolutionary processes, such as the relative contributions of selection and genetic drift to genomic change. Population size is also one of the most important parameters in conservation biology. For free-living organisms, it is expected that Ne is generally proportional to the total number of individuals in a population. However, for parasites, among other factors, populations are sometimes so extremely subdivided that high levels of inbreeding may distort these relationships. In this study, we used whole-genome sequence data from dove parasites and phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relationship between parasite effective population size (Ne) and host population size and body size. Our results revealed a positive relationship between parasite effective population size (Ne) and host body size, but not host population size. These results suggest that the size of parasite infrapopulations may be the most important factor when considering parasite effective population size, and have important implications for conservation.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic pollution in aquatic environments has increased dramatically, with adverse effects on many organisms. Benthic organisms, including many invertebrates, can sense underwater sounds, yet the responses they trigger in these organisms have received little attention. This study investigates the impact of underwater sound on the behaviour of the red cherry shrimp Neocaridina davidi as a model of freshwater decapod. The effect of underwater sound exposure on the movement behaviour and feeding performance of individual shrimps was assessed. Movement speed decreased significantly upon opening the divider in both the sound and control treatments. However, there were no significant changes in total minutes between the control and sound treatments, implying no sound-related initial changes for releasing movement. The spatial distribution of shrimps in response to the sound treatment showed significant changes; shrimps spent more time at the farthest point from the sound source. The time to find the food source (latency) also increased in the sound treatment compared to the control. Moreover, in terms of the number of successes and failures in finding the food source in the control treatment, significantly more shrimps succeeded in finding the food source. Besides, the number of revisits to the food source decreased in sound treatment compared to control and more shrimps were significantly distracted in sound treatment. Our study highlights the crustaceans ability to receive human-made sound. Thus, they are prone to the impacts of anthropogenic sound, causing negative impacts on their movement-swimming activities, and feeding behaviour and exposing them to potential predator threats. Affecting foraging performance in this gregarious species may have detrimental impacts on their reproductive success and, subsequently unexpected fitness consequences.",

    "abstract": "The gut microbiota is now recognized as a key parameter affecting the hosts anti-cancer immunosurveillance and ability to respond to immunotherapy. Therefore, optimal modulation for preventive and therapeutic purposes is very appealing. Diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiota, and thus nutritional intervention could be exploited to improve host anti-cancer immunity. Here, we show that an inulin-enriched diet, a prebiotic known to promote immunostimulatory bacteria, triggers an enhanced Th1-polarized CD4+ and CD8+ {beta} T cell-mediated anti-tumor response and attenuates tumor growth in three preclinical tumor-bearing mouse models. We highlighted that the inulin-mediated anti-tumor effect relies on the activation of both intestinal and tumor-infiltrating {gamma}{delta} T cells that are indispensable for {beta} T cell activation and subsequent tumor growth control, in a microbiota-dependent manner. Overall, our data identified these cells as a critical immune subset, mandatory for inulin-mediated anti-tumor immunity in vivo, further supporting and rationalizing the use of such prebiotic approaches, as well as the development of immunotherapies targeting {gamma}{delta} T cells in cancer prevention and immunotherapy.\n\nSignificanceOur study reveals that {gamma}{delta} T cells anti-cancer activity can be improved by nutritional intervention, in a microbiota-dependent manner. This work also indicates that {gamma}{delta} T cells are indispensable for reinforcing {beta} T cells cancer immunosurveillance and subsequent tumor growth control. We believe that these findings could be of interest to the field of gut microbiota modulation, rationalizing the use of such prebiotic approaches as well as {gamma}{delta} T cells targeting, in cancer prevention and immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "PurposeWhile the recommended analysis method for magnetic resonance spectroscopy data is linear combination model (LCM) fitting, the supervised deep learning (DL) approach for quantification of MR spectroscopy (MRS) and MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) data recently showed encouraging results; however, supervised learning requires ground truth fitted spectra, which is not practical. Moreover, this work investigates the feasibility and efficiency of the LCM-based self-supervised DL method for the analysis of MRS data.\n\nMethodWe present a novel DL-based method for the quantification of relative metabolite concentrations, using quantum-mechanics simulated metabolite responses and neural networks. We trained, validated, and evaluated the proposed networks with simulated and publicly accessible in-vivo human brain MRS data and compared the performance with traditional methods. A novel adaptive macromolecule fitting algorithm is included. We investigated the performance of the proposed methods in a Monte Carlo (MC) study.\n\nResultThe validation using low-SNR simulated data demonstrated that the proposed methods could perform quantification comparably to other methods. The applicability of the proposed method for the quantification of in-vivo MRS data was demonstrated.

    "abstract": "BackgroundReduced folate carrier 1 (RFC1; SLC19a1) is the main responsible transporter for the B9 family of vitamins named folates, which are essential for normal tissue growth and development. While folate deficiency resulted in retinal vasculopathy, the expression and the role of RFC1 in blood-retinal barrier (BRB) are not well known.\n\nMethodsWe used whole mount retinas and trypsin digested microvessel samples of adult mice. To knockdown RFC1, we delivered RFC1-targeted short interfering RNA (RFC1-siRNA) intravitreally; while, to upregulate RFC1 we delivered lentiviral vector overexpressing RFC1. Retinal ischemia was induced 1-hour by applying FeCl3 to central retinal artery. We used RT-qPCR and Western blotting to determine RFC1. Endothelium (CD31), pericytes (PDGFR-beta, CD13, NG2), tight-junctions (Occludin, Claudin-5 and ZO-1), main basal membrane protein (Collagen-4), endogenous IgG and RFC1 were determined immunohistochemically.\n\nResultsOur analyses on whole mount retinas and trypsin digested microvessel samples of adult mice revealed the presence of RFC1 in the inner BRB and colocalization with endothelial cells and pericytes. Knocking down RFC1 expression via siRNA delivery resulted in the disintegration of tight junction proteins and collagen-4 in twenty-four hours, which was accompanied by significant endogenous IgG extravasation. This indicated the impairment of BRB integrity after an abrupt RFC1 decrease. Furthermore, lentiviral vector-mediated RFC1 overexpression resulted in increased tight junction proteins and collagen-4, confirming the structural role of RFC1 in the inner BRB. Acute retinal ischemia decreased collagen-4 and occludin levels and led to an increase in RFC1. Besides, the pre-ischemic overexpression of RFC1 partially rescued collagen-4 and occludin levels which would be decreased after ischemia.\n\nConclusionIn conclusion, our study clarifies the presence of RFC1 protein in the inner BRB, which has recently been defined as hypoxia-immune-related gene in other tissues and offers a novel perspective of retinal RFC1. Hence, other than being a folate carrier, RFC1 is an acute regulator of the inner BRB in healthy and ischemic retinas.",

    "abstract": "The Bed Nucleus of the Stria Terminalis (BNST) has been studied extensively for its coordination of opposing adaptive behaviors. Previously, we uncovered a critical role for Corticotropin-Releasing Factor (CRF)-expressing neurons of the oval nucleus of the BNST (BNSTovCRF) in maintaining resilience to social defeat through stress-dependent self-sustaining neuronal activity.1 However, as mice develop resilience, it is not well-understood how affect and motivation are altered to achieve adaptive behavior in the face of ongoing threat. Here, we explore how this neuronal population exerts a powerful influence over internal state in various stress contexts to promote adaptive social responding. Using cell-type-selective optogenetics, a suite of behavioral paradigms, and transgenic Crf-ChR2 mice, we show that BNSTovCRF neurons induce resiliency by altering the encoding of psychosocial stress, enhancing the appetitiveness of social interaction, and enhancing tolerability to physical stress. Adaptive responses to stress typically emanate as a response to negative internal states by external stimuli; here, we show that in resilient mice, stressful environments are less aversive than susceptible mice, suggesting a different motivational capacity to endure stress in this group. Thus, we describe a novel role for BNSTovCRF neurons in resisting the emotional effects of cumulative stress by reducing the internal experience of aversion",

Filaments composed of ESCRT-III subunits constrict membranes of the intercellular bridge midbody to the abscission point. These filaments also bind and recruit cofactors whose activities help execute abscission and/or delay abscission timing in response to mitotic errors via the NoCut/Abscission checkpoint. We previously showed that the ESCRT-III subunit IST1 binds the cysteine protease CAPN7 (Calpain-7) and that CAPN7 is required for both efficient abscission and NoCut checkpoint maintenance (Wenzel et al., 2022). Here, we report biochemical and crystallographic studies showing that the tandem MIT domains of CAPN7 bind simultaneously to two distinct IST1 MIT interaction motifs. Structure-guided point mutations in either CAPN7 MIT domain disrupted IST1 binding in vitro and in cells, and depletion/rescue experiments showed that the CAPN7-IST1 interaction is required for: 1) CAPN7 recruitment to midbodies, 2) efficient abscission, and 3) NoCut checkpoint arrest. CAPN7 proteolytic activity is also required for abscission and checkpoint maintenance. Hence, IST1 recruits CAPN7 to midbodies, where its proteolytic activity is required to regulate and complete abscission.",

    "abstract": "Mated females reallocate resources to offspring production, causing changes in nutritional requirements and challenges to energy homeostasis. Although observed in most species, the neural and endocrine mechanisms that regulate the nutritional needs of mated females are not well understood. Here, we investigate the neural circuitry that regulates sugar appetite in mated Drosophila melanogaster females. During copulation, a male-derived sex peptide is transferred to females, silencing the mating status circuit to elicit many postmating behavioral changes1-3. We find that increased sucrose consumption is a postmated female behavior and show that it is mediated by the mating status circuit. We discovered that sexually dimorphic insulin receptor (Lgr3) neurons integrate mating status and nutritional state signals to adjust sucrose consumption. Lgr3+ cells receive inhibitory input from the mating status circuit via female specific pCd-2 neurons. In mated females, the inhibition of Lgr3 cells from pCd-2 is attenuated, transforming the mated signal into a long-term hunger signal that promotes sugar intake. Our results thus demonstrate that the mating circuit alters nutrient sensing centers in females to promote sugar consumption, providing a mechanism to increase intake in anticipation of the energetic costs associated with reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are rare tissue-resident \"helper\" lymphocytes that do not express diversified antigen receptors. Type 3 ILCs (ILC3s) are an important class of these cells enriched in the respiratory and intestinal mucosa, where they regulate inflammation and mucosal homeostasis. To gain insight into the cis-regulatory circuitries underlying ILC3 function, we used high-resolution Capture Hi-C to profile promoter-anchored chromosomal contacts in human primary ILC3s. Combining significant interaction detection with the Activity-By-Contact approach adapted to Capture Hi-C, we reveal a multitude of contacts between promoters and distal regulatory elements and obtain evidence for distinct regulatory wiring of alternative promoters. We find that promoter-interacting regions in ILC3s are enriched for genetic variants associated with multiple immune diseases. Focusing on Crohns disease (CD), in which ILC3s are established mediators, we devised a Bayesian approach that incorporates multivariate fine-mapping to link CD-associated genetic variants with putative target genes. We identify known and previously unimplicated genes in conferring genetic risk of CD through activity in ILC3s. This includes the CLN3 gene that is mutated in most cases of the neurodegenerative disorder Batten disease. Using Cln3 mutant mice, we show that CLN3 is a putative negative regulator of IL-17 production in an inflammatory subset of ILC3s. This finding suggests a functional role for CLN3 in ILC3 biology, with mechanistic implications for Crohns and Batten diseases.",

    "abstract": "Identifying relatives across cohorts makes one of the basic routines for genomic data. As conventional such practice often requires explicit genomic data sharing, it is easily hampered by privacy or ethical constraints. In this study, using our proposed scheme for genomic encryption we developed encG-reg, a regression approach that is able to detect relatives of various degrees based on encrypted genomic data. The encryption properties of encG-reg is built on random matrix theory, which masks the original genotypic matrix but still provides controllable precision to that of direct individual-level genotype data. After having found tractable eighth-order moments for encrypted genotype, we established connection between the dimension of a random matrix and the required precision of a study. encG-reg consequently led to balanced i) false positive and false negative rates and ii) the computational cost and the degree of relatives to be searched. We validated encG-reg in 485,158 UKBiobank multi-ethnical samples, and the resolution of encG-reg was comparable with the conventional method such as KING. In a more complex application, we launched a fine-devised multi-center collaboration across 6 research institutes in China, covering 11 cohorts of 64,091 GWAS samples. In both examples, encG-reg robustly identified and validated relatives existing across the cohorts even under various ethnical background and different genotypic qualities.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation plays crucial roles in both sustaining cellular function and perpetuating disease states. Despite extensive studies, our understanding of this process is hindered by low solubility of phase-separating proteins. One example of this is found in SR proteins. These proteins are characterized by domains rich in arginine and serine (RS domains), which are essential to alternative splicing, in vivo phase separation, and a low solubility that has made these proteins difficult to study for decades. Here, we solubilize the founding member of the SR family, SRSF1, by introducing a peptide mimicking RS repeats as a co-solute. We find that this RS-mimic peptide forms interactions similar to those of the proteins RS domain. Both interact with a combination of surface-exposed aromatic residues and acidic residues on SRSF1s RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) through electrostatic and cation-pi interactions. Analysis of RRM domains spanning the human proteome indicates that RRM domains involved in phase separation have more exposed aromatic residues and that in phase-separating proteins containing RS repeats, such residues are frequently surrounded by acidic residues. In addition to opening an avenue to previously unavailable proteins, our work provides insight into how SR proteins phase separate and participate in nuclear speckles.",

    "abstract": "Performance during instrumental learning is commonly believed to reflect the knowledge that has been acquired up to that point. However, recent work in rodents found that instrumental performance was enhanced during periods when reinforcement was withheld, relative to periods when reinforcement was provided. This suggests that reinforcement may mask acquired knowledge and lead to impaired performance. In the present study, we investigated whether such a beneficial effect of removing reinforcement translates to humans. Specifically, we tested whether performance during learning was improved during non-reinforced relative to reinforced task periods using signal detection theory and a computational modelling approach. To this end, 60 healthy volunteers performed a novel visual go/no-go learning task with deterministic reinforcement. To probe acquired knowledge in the absence of reinforcement, we interspersed blocks without feedback. In these non-reinforced task blocks, we found an increased d, indicative of enhanced instrumental performance. However, computational modelling showed that this improvement in performance was not due to an increased sensitivity of decision making to learnt values, but to a more cautious mode of responding, as evidenced by a reduction of a general response bias. Together with an initial tendency to act, this is sufficient to drive differential changes in hit and false alarm rates that jointly lead to an increased d. To conclude, the improved instrumental performance in the absence of reinforcement observed in studies using asymmetrically reinforced go/no-go tasks may reflect a change in response bias rather than unmasking latent knowledge.\n\nAuthor SummaryIt appears plausible that we can only learn and improve if we are told what is right and wrong. But what if feedback overshadows our actual expertise? In many situations, people learn from immediate feedback on their choices, while the same choices are also used as a measure of their knowledge. This inevitably confounds learning and the read-out of learnt associations. Recently, it was suggested that rodents express their true knowledge of a task during periods when they are not rewarded or punished during learning. During these periods, animals displayed improved performance. We found a similar improvement of performance in the absence of feedback in human volunteers. Using a combination of computational modelling and a learning task in which humans performance was tested with and without feedback, we found that participants adjusted their response strategy. When feedback was not available, participants displayed a reduced propensity to act. Together with an asymmetric availability of information in the learning environment, this shift to a more cautious response mode was sufficient to yield improved performance. In contrast to the rodent study, our results do not suggest that feedback masks acquired knowledge. Instead, it supports a different mode of responding.",

    "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are increasingly prevalent in the aging population, yet currently no disease-modifying treatments are available. Increasing the expression of the cold-shock protein, RBM3, through therapeutic hypothermia is remarkably neuroprotective, but cooling poses a health risk itself, strongly limiting its clinical application. Selective upregulation of RBM3 at normothermia thus holds immense therapeutic potential. Here we identify a poison exon within the RBM3 gene that is solely responsible for cold-induced RBM3 expression. Genetic removal or ASO-mediated manipulation of this exon yields high RBM3 levels independent of cooling. Notably, a single administration of ASO to exclude the poison exon, using FDA-approved chemistry, results in long-lasting increase of RBM3 expression in mouse brains. In prion-diseased mice, this treatment leads to remarkable neuroprotection, with prevention of neuronal loss and spongiosis despite high levels of prion protein. RBM3-inducing ASOs could thus broadly deliver protection in humans in conditions ranging from acute brain injury to Alzheimers disease.\n\nOne sentence summaryInducing cold shock protein RBM3 by modulating its alternative splicing at normothermia is neuroprotective in vivo",

    "abstract": "Understanding the genetic basis and inheritance of a trait facilitates the planning of breeding and development programs of new cultivars. In the sugar apple tree (Annona squamosa L.), the mechanism of the desirable seedless trait in the Thai seedless (Ts) and Brazilian seedless (Bs) accessions was associated with a deletion of the INNER NO OUTER (INO) locus. Genetic analysis of F1, F2 and backcross descendants of crosses of Bs to fertile wild-type varieties showed that seedlessness was recessive and monogenic. Whole genome sequencing of a third accession, Hawaiian seedless (Hs), identified a 16 kilobase deletion including INO. The finding of an identical deletion in Ts and Bs indicated a common origin among genotypes, from a single deletion event. Analysis of microsatellite markers could not preclude the possibility that all three accessions are vegetatively propagated clones. The sequence of the deletion site enabled formulation of a codominant assay for the wild-type and mutant genes that validated the INO gene deletion as the cause of seedless trait, and can be used in the selection of new seedless varieties. The study findings and obtained progenies should be useful in breeding and introgression programs of the trait into elite sugar apple lines and into other Annonas by means of interspecific crossings.",

    "abstract": "Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is an autosomal dominant inherited multisystem neoplasia disorder caused by the VHL tumor suppressor gene, coding for VHL protein (pVHL), variants. Various types of VHL variants present different clinical phenotypes that later lead to events resulting in benign or malignant lesions including Retinal Capillary Hemangioblastoma (RCH). We reported on 3 novel mutation sites observed in 3 families (5 RCH patients), including c.511A>C, c.514C>T, and c.511A>T in exon 3 of the VHL gene. According to the ACMG classifications, c.514C>T and c.511A>T variations are likely pathogenic, and c.511A>C is a variant of uncertain significance (VUS) and in accordance with autosomal dominant inheritance. The location and impact of the incidence mutations on pVHL were computed using in silico analysis. The obtained structural information and computational analysis showed that the studied mutations induce conformational changes that limit the flexibility of the pVHL interaction interface with elonginB/C, elongin C/B, and cullin2, which is necessary for HIF1 alpha binding. The recently added gene variants and their related clinical phenotypes will improve the VHL diagnosis accuracy and the patients population carrying VHL gene mutations. These pioneering results could be a model for future functional studies.",

    "abstract": "Most neuroimaging studies display results that represent only a tiny fraction of the collected data. While it is conventional to present \"only the significant results\" to the reader, here we suggest that this practice has several negative consequences for both reproducibility and understanding. This practice hides away most of the results of the dataset and leads to problems of selection bias and irreproducibility, both of which have been recognized as major issues in neuroimaging studies recently. Opaque, all-or-nothing thresholding, even if well-intentioned, places undue influence on arbitrary filter values, hinders clear communication of scientific results, wastes data, is antithetical to good scientific practice, and leads to conceptual inconsistencies. It is also inconsistent with the properties of the acquired data and the underlying biology being studied. Instead of presenting only a few statistically significant locations and hiding away the remaining results, we propose that studies should \"highlight\" the former while also showing as much as possible of the rest. This is distinct from but complementary to utilizing data sharing repositories: the initial presentation of results has an enormous impact on the interpretation of a study. We present practical examples for voxelwise, regionwise and cross-study analyses using publicly available data that was analyzed previously by 70 teams (NARPS; Botvinik-Nezer, et al., 2020), showing that it is possible to balance the goals of displaying a full set of results with providing the reader reasonably concise and \"digestible\" findings. In particular, the highlighting approach sheds useful light on the kind of variability present among the NARPS teams results, which is primarily a varied strength of agreement rather than disagreement. Using a meta-analysis built on the informative \"highlighting\" approach shows this relative agreement, while one using the standard \"hiding\" approach does not. We describe how this simple but powerful change in practice---focusing on highlighting results, rather than hiding all but the strongest ones---can help address many large concerns within the field, or at least to provide more complete information about them. We include a list of practical suggestions for results reporting to improve reproducibility, cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMost studies do not present all results of their analysis, hiding subthreshold ones.\nC_LIO_LIHiding results negatively affects the interpretation and understanding of the study.\nC_LIO_LINeuroimagers should present all results of their study, highlighting key ones.\nC_LIO_LIUsing the public NARPS data, we show several benefits of the \"highlighting\" approach.\nC_LIO_LIThe highlighting approach improves individual studies and meta-analyses.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "A fundamental concept in neuroscience is the transmission of information between neurons via neurotransmitters, -modulators, and - peptides. For the past decades the gold standard for measuring neurochemicals in awake animals has been microdialysis (MD). The emergence of genetically encoded fluorescence-based biosensors, as well as in vivo optical techniques such as fiber photometry (FP), have introduced technologically distinct means of measuring neurotransmission. To directly compare MD and FP, we performed concurrent within-animal recordings of extracellular dopamine (DA) in the dorsal striatum (DS) before and after administration of amphetamine in awake, freely behaving mice expressing the dopamine sensor dLight1.3b. We show that despite temporal differences, MD- and FP-based readouts of DA correlate well within mice. Down-sampling of FP data showed temporal correlation to MD data, with less variance observed using FP. We also present evidence that DA fluctuations periodically reach low levels and naive animals have rapid, pre-drug DA dynamics measured with FP that correlate to the subsequent pharmacodynamics of amphetamine as measured with MD and FP.",

Our study aimed to investigate the accuracy with which supervised machine learning, a deep convolutional neural network, can be used to retrieve body condition score (BCS) classes estimated by an expert. Using a simple action camera, we recorded images of animals rumps in three large-scale farms. The images were annotated with three different-sized boxes by an expert. A Faster-RCNN pre-trained model was trained on 12 and 3 BCS classes. Training in 12 classes, with a 0 error range, the Cohens kappa value yielded minimal agreement. Allowing an error range of 0.25, we obtained a minimum or week agreement. With an error range of 0.5, we had strong or almost perfect agreements. The kappa values of the approach trained on 3 classes show that we can classify all animals into BCS categories with at least moderate agreement. Furthermore, CNNs trained in 3 BCS classes show a remarkably higher proportion of strong agreement than those trained in 12 classes. The prediction precision based on training with various annotation regions showed no meaningful differences.",

    "abstract": "Automatic segmentation of nuclei in low-light microscopy images remains a difficult task, especially for high-throughput experiments where need for automation is strong. Low saliency of nuclei with respect to the background, variability of their intensity together with low signal-to-noise ratio in these images constitute a major challenge for mainstream algorithms of nuclei segmentation. In this work we introduce SalienceNet, an unsupervised deep learning-based method that uses the style transfer properties of cycleGAN to transform low saliency images into high saliency images, thus enabling accurate segmentation by downstream analysis methods, and that without need for any parameter tuning. We have acquired a novel dataset of organoid images with soSPIM, a microscopy technique that enables the acquisition of images in low-light conditions. Our experiments show that SalienceNet increased the saliency of these images up to the desired level. Moreover, we evaluated the impact of SalienceNet on segmentation for both Otsu thresholding and StarDist and have shown that enhancing nuclei with SalienceNet improved segmentation results using Otsu thresholding by 30% and using StarDist by 26% in terms of IOU when compared to segmentation of non-enhanced images. Together these results show that SalienceNet can be used as a common preprocessing step to automate nuclei segmentation pipelines for low-light microscopy images.",

    "abstract": "The collective nature of the variation in host associated microbial communities suggest that they exhibit low dimensional characteristics. To identify these lower dimensional descriptors, we propose SMbiot (pronounced SIM BY OT): a Shared Latent Model for Microbiomes and their hosts. In SMbiot, latent variables embed host-specific microbial communities in a lower dimensional space and the corresponding features reflect controlling axes that dictate community compositions. Using data from different animal hosts, organ sites, and microbial kingdoms of life, we show that SMbiot identifies a small number of host-specific latent variables that accurately capture the compositional variation in host associated microbial communities. By using the same latents to describe hosts phenotypic states and the host-associated microbiomes, we show that the latent space embedding is informed by host physiology as well as the associated microbiomes. Importantly, SMbiot enables the quantification of host phenotypic differences associated with altered microbial community compositions in a host-specific manner, underscoring the context specificity of host-microbiome associations. SMbiot can also predict missing host metadata or microbial community compositions. This way, SMbiot is a concise quantitative method to understand the low dimensional collective behavior of host-associated microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Studies of the structural and molecular features of the lymphatic vasculature, which clears fluid, macromolecules and leukocytes from the tissue microenvironment, have largely relied on animal models, with limited information in human organs beyond traditional immunohistochemical assessment. Here, we use three-dimensional imaging and single-cell RNA-sequencing to study lymphatics in the human kidney. We found a hierarchical arrangement of lymphatic vessels within human kidneys, initiating along specialised nephron epithelium in the renal cortex and displaying a distinct, kidney-specific transcriptional profile. In chronic transplant rejection we found kidney allograft lymphatic expansion alongside a loss of structural hierarchy, with human leukocyte antigen-expressing lymphatic vessels infiltrating the medulla, presenting a putative target for alloreactive antibodies. This occurred concurrently with lymphatic vessels invading and interconnecting tertiary lymphoid structures at early stages of lymphocyte colonisation. Analysis of intercellular signalling revealed upregulation of co-inhibitory molecule-mediated CD4+ T cell-lymphatic crosstalk in rejecting kidneys, potentially acting to limit local alloimmune responses. Overall, we delineate novel structural and molecular features of human kidney lymphatics and reveal perturbations to their phenotype and transcriptome in the context of alloimmunity.\n\nSUMMARYLymphatics regulate fluid balance and immune cell accumulation but are under-studied in human organs such as the kidney.

    "abstract": "The adult uterus regenerates in the human during the menstrual cycle, and remodels in the mouse during the estrous cycle. Decades of work has demonstrated that this process is controlled by cycling steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone. However, downstream signaling pathways that link hormonal action to this regeneration and remodeling are yet to be identified in the cycling uterus. We set out to identify these pathways, with the overarching hypothesis that developmental signaling pathways are redeployed in the adult uterus to control remodeling in the mouse. We were surprised to find that the majority of Hedgehog signaling components were transcriptionally co-regulated throughout the estrous cycle. To test the role of Hh signaling in cyclical uterine remodeling, we conditionally knocked out the major activator of the pathway, smoothened (Smo) using the progesterone receptor cre (PR-Cre). In the absence of Hh signaling, the uterus no longer remodels throughout the estrous cycle. We also show that the smooth muscle fibers of the uterus are significantly larger in the conditional knockouts compared to the controls suggesting hypertrophy of the smooth muscle. Our findings support the possibility that this smooth muscle homeostasis may underlie important aspects of uterine function such as contractility during late-stage pregnancy or the development of uterine smooth muscle tumors.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicroscopic analysis of plant anatomy is a common procedure in biology to study structure and function that requires high-quality sections for accurate measurements. Hand sectioning of specimens is typically limited to moderately soft tissue while harder samples prohibit sectioning by hand and/or result in inconsistent thicknesses.\n\nResultsHere we present both a clearly described hand-sectioning method and a novel microtome design that together provide the means to section a variety of plant sample types. The described hand-sectioning method for herbaceous stems works well for softer subjects but is less suitable for samples with secondary growth (e.g., wood production). Instead, the \"Rapid-Tome\" is a novel tool for sectioning both soft and tougher high-aspect-ratio samples, such as stems and roots, with excellent sample control. The Rapid-Tome can be 3D-printed in approximately 13 hours on a mid-quality printer common at university maker spaces. After printing and trimming, Rapid-Tome assembly takes a few minutes with five metal parts common at hardware stores. Users sectioned a variety of plant samples including the hollow internodes of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), fibrous switchgrass roots containing aerenchyma, and woody branches of eastern red cedar (Juniper virginiana) and American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis). A comparative analyses with Rapid-Tome-produced sections readily revealed a significant difference in seasonal growth of sycamore xylem vessel area in spring (49%) vs. summer (23%). Additionally, high school students with no prior experience produced sections with the Rapid-Tome adequate for comparative analyses of various plant samples in less than an hour.\n\nConclusionsThe described hand-sectioning method is suitable for softer tissues, including hollow-stemmed grasses and similar samples. In addition, the Rapid-Tome provides capacity to safely produce high-quality sections of tougher plant materials at a fraction of the cost of traditional microtomes combined with excellent sample control. The Rapid-Tome features rapid sectioning, sample advancement, blade changes, and sample changes; is highly portable and can be used easily with minimal training making production of thin sections accessible for classroom and outreach use, in addition to research.",

    "abstract": "The occurrence of plant disease is determined by interactions among host, pathogen and climate conditions. Air humidity has long been recognized to profoundly influence diseases in the phyllosphere and high air humidity (e.g., after rain falls) is known as a prerequisite for numerous disease outbreaks in the field1-3. However, the molecular basis of how high humidity interferes with plant resistance mechanisms to favor disease remained elusive. Here we show that high humidity is associated with an \"immune-compromised\" status of plants, revealed by lower expression of defense genes during bacterial infection of Arabidopsis plants. Examination of humiditys effect on individual immune pathways showed that the accumulation and signaling of salicylic acid (SA), an essential hormone conferring plant resistance against infectious microbes4,5, are significantly inhibited under high humidity. Surprisingly, NPR1 protein, an SA receptor and central transcriptional co-activator of SA-responsive genes6-9, accumulated to a significantly higher level in the nucleus under high humidity. Further investigation indicated a decreased binding affinity of NPR1 protein to the target gene promoter, suggestive of an \"inactive\" nature of NPR1, under high humidity and an impaired ubiquitination and degradation of NPR1 protein, likely due to down-regulation of Cullin 3-mediated cellular ubiquitination pathway and 26S proteasome pathway under high humidity. Our study uncovers disruption of NPR1 protein turnover as a major mechanism, by which high humidity dampens plant immune strength against pathogens, and provides new insights into the long-observed air humidity influence on diseases in nature.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic actuators have revolutionized the resolution at which we can assert control over biological processes in living systems. In plants, deployment of optogenetics is challenging due to the need for these light-responsive systems to maintain a single activation state in conventional horticultural environments with light-dark cycling. Furthermore, many available optogenetic actuators are based on plant photoreceptors that might crosstalk with endogenous signaling processes, while others depend on exogenously supplied cofactors. To overcome such challenges, we have developed Highlighter; a synthetic, light-gated gene expression system tailored for in planta function. Highlighter is based on the photoswitchable CcaS-CcaR system from cyanobacteria and is repurposed for plants as a fully genetically encoded system, engineered to photoswitch with the endogenous plant chromophore, phytochromobilin. We deployed Highlighter in transiently transformed Nicotiana benthamiana for optogenetic control of fluorescent protein expression and innate immune responses. Using light to guide differential fluorescent protein expression in nuclei of neighboring cells, we demonstrate unprecedented spatiotemporal control of target gene expression. We furthermore regulate activation of plant immunity by modulating the spectral composition of white light, demonstrating optogenetic control of a biological process in horticultural light environments. Highlighter is a step forward for optogenetics in plants and a technology for high-resolution gene induction that will advance fundamental plant biology and provide new opportunities for crop improvement.",

    "abstract": "In order to respond appropriately to threats in the environment, the brain must rapidly determine whether a stimulus is important and whether it is positive or negative, and then use that information to direct behavioral responses. Neurons in the amygdala have long been implicated in valence encoding and in fear responses to threatening stimuli, but show transient firing responses in response to these stimuli that do not match the timescales of associated behavioral responses. For decades, there has been a logical gap in how behavioral responses could be mediated without an ensemble representation of the internal state of valence that has rapid onset, high signal-to-noise, and is sustained for the duration of the behavioral state. Here, we present the amygdalostriatal transition zone (ASt) as a missing piece of this highly conserved process that is of paramount importance for survival, which does exactly this: represents an internal state (e.g. fear) that can be expressed in multiple motor outputs (e.g. freezing or escape). The ASt is anatomically positioned as a \"shortcut\" to connect the corticolimbic system (important for evaluation) with the basal ganglia (important for action selection) with the inputs of the amygdala and the outputs of the striatum - ideally poised for evaluating and responding to environmental threats. From in vivo cellular resolution recordings that include both electrophysiology and calcium imaging, we find that ASt neurons are unique in that they are sparse coding, extremely high signal-to-noise, and also maintain a sustained response for negative valence stimuli for the duration of the defensive behavior - a rare but essential combination. We further show that photostimulation of the ASt is sufficient to drive freezing and avoidance behaviors. Using single-nucleus RNA sequencing and in situ RNA labelling we generate a comprehensive profile of cell types and gene expression in the ASt, and find the ASt is genetically distinct from adjacent striatal and amygdalar structures. We also find that the ASt has a greater proportion of neurons expressing Drd2 than neurons expressing Drd1a, a unique feature compared to other regions of the striatum. Using in vivo calcium imaging, we show that that this Drd2+ population robustly encodes stimuli of negative valence, and in loss-of-function experiments find that optogenetic inhibition of Drd2+ ASt neurons causes a striking reduction in cue-conditioned fear responses. Together, our findings identify the ASt as a previously-unappreciated critical missing link for encoding learned associations and directing ongoing behavior.",

    "abstract": "In-depth knowledge of the cellular and molecular composition of dental pulp (DP) and the crosstalk between DP cells that drive tissue homeostasis or regeneration are not well understood. To address these questions, we performed data analysis of publicly available single-cell transcriptomes of DP. This analysis revealed that DP resident fibroblasts have a unique gene expression profile when compared with fibroblasts from 5 other reference tissues: blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, lung, and skin. Genes coded for heparin-binding growth-factors, pleiotrophin (PTN) and midkine (MDK), possessed the highest differential expression levels in DP fibroblasts. In addition, we identified extensive crosstalk between DP fibroblasts and several other DP cells, including Schwann cells, MSCs and odontoblasts. These findings suggest that fibroblast-derived growth factors regulate DP niches, and thus have a potential role as dental therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Budding yeast uses the well-conserved TORC1-Sch9 and cAMP-PKA signalling pathways to regulate adaptations to changing nutrient environments. Dynamic and single-cell measurements of the activity of these two cascades will improve our understanding of cellular adaptation of yeast. Here, we employed the AKAR3-EV biosensor developed for mammalian cells to measure the cellular phosphorylation status determined by Sch9 and PKA activity in budding yeast. Using various mutant strains and inhibitors, we show that AKAR3-EV robustly measures the Sch9- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation status in intact yeast cells. At the single-cell level, we found that the phosphorylation responses are homogenous for glucose, sucrose and fructose, but highly heterogeneous for mannose. The Sch9 and PKA pathways have a relatively high affinity for glucose (K0.5 of 0.24 mM) under glucose derepressed conditions. Lastly, steady-state FRET levels of AKAR3-EV seem to be independent of growth rates, suggesting that the Sch9- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation activity are transient responses to nutrient transitions. We believe that the AKAR3-EV sensor is an excellent addition to the biosensor arsenal for illuminating cellular adaptation in single yeast cells.",

    "abstract": "Exposure of pregnant F0 mouse dams to the obesogen tributyltin (TBT) predisposes unexposed male descendants to obesity and diverts mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) toward the adipocytic lineage. TBT also promotes adipogenic commitment and differentiation of MSCs, in vitro. We sought to identify TBT-induced factors predisposing MSCs toward the adipocytic fate. We exposed mouse MSCs to TBT, the PPAR{gamma}-selective agonist rosiglitazone or the RXR-selective agonist LG-100268 and determined their transcriptomal profiles to determine candidate microRNAs (miR) regulating adipogenic commitment and differentiation. Of the top 10 candidate microRNAs predicted by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis, miR-21, miR-33 and miR-223 were expressed in a manner consistent with an ability to differentially regulate target genes during adipogenesis. After 24 hours exposure to 50 nM TBT, miR-223 levels in MSCs were increased and expression of its target genes ZEB1, NFIB, and FOXP1 was decreased. Both ROSI and TBT increased miR-223 levels, and this induction was inhibited by the PPAR{gamma} antagonist T0070907 but not by the RXR antagonists HX531 or UVI3003, placing miR-223 downstream of PPAR{gamma}. Chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed TBT-induced binding of PPAR{gamma} to regulatory elements in the miR-223 promoter. miR-223 levels were elevated in white adipose tissue of F2 and F3 male descendants of pregnant F0 mouse dams exposed to 50 nM TBT throughout gestation. miR-223 levels were further induced in males fed with an increased fat diet. We infer that TBT induced miR-223 expression and increased adipogenesis in MSCs through the PPAR{gamma} pathway and that transgenerationally increased expression of miR-223 plays an important role in the development of obesity caused by TBT exposure.",

    "abstract": "Burgeoning evidence demonstrates that responses to environmental exposures can be transmitted to subsequent generations through the germline without DNA mutations1,2. This is controversial because underlying mechanisms remain to be identified. Therefore, understanding how effects of environmental exposures are transmitted to unexposed generations without DNA mutations is a fundamental unanswered question in biology. Here, we used an established murine model of transgenerational obesity to show that direct or ancestral exposure to the obesogen tributyltin (TBT) elicited persistent changes in topologically associating domains (TADs) in primordial germ cells (PGCs) isolated from embryos of exposed and subsequent unexposed generations. New TAD boundaries were formed within the Ide gene encoding insulin degrading enzyme in the exposed PGCs, then stably maintained in PGCs of the subsequent (unexposed) two generations. Concomitantly, Ide mRNA expression was decreased in livers of male descendants from the exposed dams. These animals were hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic, phenocopying Ide-deficient mice that are predisposed to adult-onset obesity. Creation of new TAD boundaries in PGCs, suppression of hepatic Ide mRNA, increased fat mass, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia were male-specific. Our results provide a plausible molecular mechanism underlying transmission of the transgenerational predisposition to obesity caused by gestational exposure to an environmental obesogen. They also provide an entry point for future studies aimed at understanding how environmental exposures alter chromatin structure to influence physiology across multiple generations in mammals.",
