    "abstract": "BackgroundIntermittent access to ethanol (EtOH) drives persistent escalation of intake and rapid transition from moderate to compulsive-like drinking. Intermittent EtOH drinking may facilitate escalation in part by altering aversion-sensitive neural substrates, such as the insular cortex (IC), thus driving greater approach toward stimuli previously treated as aversive.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a series of experiments in rats to examine behavioral and neural responses associated with escalation of EtOH intake. First, taste reactivity analyses quantified the degree that intermittent brief-access ethanol exposure (BAEE) alters sensitivity to the aversive properties of EtOH. Next, we determined whether pharmacological IC inhibition facilitated EtOH escalation. Finally, given that IC is primary gustatory cortex, we employed psychophysical paradigms to assess whether escalation of EtOH intake induced changes in EtOH taste. These paradigms measured changes in sensitivity to the intensity of EtOH taste and whether escalation shifts the salient taste quality of EtOH by measuring the degree that the taste of EtOH generalized to a sucrose-like ( sweet) or quinine-like ( bitter) percept.\n\nResultsWe found a near complete loss of aversive oromotor responses in EtOH-exposed relative to -naive rats. Additionally, we observed significantly reduced expression of EtOH-induced c-Fos expression in the posterior IC in exposed rats relative to naive rats. Inhibition of the IC resulted in a modest, but statistically reliable increase in acceptance of higher EtOH concentrations in naive rats. Finally, we found no evidence of changes in the psychophysical assessment of the taste of EtOH in exposed, relative to naive, rats.\n\nConclusionsOur results demonstrate that neural activity within the IC adapts following escalation of EtOH intake in a manner that correlates with reduced sensitivity to the aversive hedonic properties of EtOH. These data further establish that IC may be driving exposure-induced escalations in EtOH intake and directly contributing to development of compulsive-like EtOH drinking.",

    "abstract": "For a generation, neuroscience has searched for a molecule that stores our memories across time. This search has focused on proteomic mechanisms, but less is known about RNA. Here, we identify a new persisting class of RNA associated with long-term memory - Circular RNAs. Unlike other RNAs, Circular RNAs are stable for days or longer and may provide a means for storing sensory information across time. We leveraged a differential fear conditioning paradigm whereby individual mice sample all real-world sensory inputs (i.e., auditory, visual, gustatory, olfactory, and incidental tactile) in a quasi-stochastic manner prior to receiving different intensities of an unconditioned stimulus (US) foot-shock. While Pavlovian models of learning from the 20th century were critical for understanding elemental associations, they fail to appreciate (1) what US content remains inside of a complex conditioned stimulus (CS) or response (CR - a behavioral manifestation of an episodic memory), (2) what happens when the associations involve multiple senses, and (3) what biologically happens to the real-world US. Given (1) we are constantly sampling information from our environment through all our senses and (2) the US at a given moment in time likely adds value to imprint that multisensory representation, we propose the real-world US is biologically encoded via back-spliced Circular RNAs within the cells and circuits that represent a particular episodic memory and present days later. This logic, best simplified by the equation: [Formula], allowed us to ask how the formation of similar episodic memories, which only differ in relation to the content of US information, alter Circular RNAs in the CA1 subfield of the hippocampus - a brain area critical for episodic memories. We found that stronger foot-shock USs during conditioning produce stronger memories relative to weaker USs 24-h later. Stronger memories also generalize to novel/safe environments 48-h later. Moreover, the unconditioned response is highly correlated with future CRs, suggesting (1) an understudied relationship between the strength and type of US/URs and future CRs in complex environments as well as (2) fear generalization, at least in the short-term, is associated with the embedding of additional US information. Next-generation Circular RNA sequencing 1-hr after acquisition revealed a remarkably small set of circular RNAs relative to nearly identical, yet weaker, episodic memories in CA1. Gene Ontologies for mice that formed weaker and stronger memories matched those families classically involved in weaker and stronger forms of memory across species. Preliminary in situ hybridization visually confirmed the presence of Circular RNAs in the CA1 subfield. Future experiments will examine the persistence of Circular RNAs in cells of a memory trace (i.e., engram cells; in situ hybridization) at recent (4 days) and remote (21-days) time points. Taken together with our mathematical model for multisensory learning, our data suggest that Circular RNAs do not contribute to the storage of the multisensory configural representation, but perhaps to the storage of discrete pieces of real-world sensory information related to the US that is partially embedded inside of a memory trace early-on. Importantly, in the above model for multisensory learning, the discrete USs are biologically separable from the future CS(NS+US) associations and US strength is modifiable across time. This work reveals fundamental insights into how we store pieces of real-world sensory information in an episodic memory at the biological level of the brain.\n\nOne Sentence SummarycircRNAs biologically encode real-world sensory information into a long-term memory",

    "abstract": "Animals use afferent feedback to rapidly correct ongoing movements in the presence of a perturbation. Repeated exposure to a predictable perturbation leads to behavioural adaptation that counteracts its effects. Primary motor cortex (M1) is intimately involved in both processes, integrating inputs from various sensorimotor brain regions to update the motor output. Here, we investigate whether feedback-based motor control and motor adaptation may share a common implementation in M1 circuits. We trained a recurrent neural network to control its own output through an error feedback signal, which allowed it to recover rapidly from external perturbations. Implementing a biologically plausible plasticity rule based on this same feedback signal also enabled the network to learn to counteract persistent perturbations through a trial-by-trial process, in a manner that reproduced several key aspects of human adaptation. Moreover, the resultant network activity changes were also present in neural population recordings from monkey M1. Online movement correction and longer-term motor adaptation may thus share a common implementation in neural circuits.",

    "abstract": "Many clinically important viruses, including influenza A, SARS-CoV-1, adenoviruses, and DNA tumour viruses such as Kaposis sarcoma herpesvirus use multivalent binding to sialic acid (SA) to infect cells, or to modulate immune responses through interactions with sialylated attachment factors that facilitate virus infectivity and/or host survival. Molecular scaffolds rich in SA that bind virions with high avidity may therefore be useful as anti-infective medicines. We generated a panel of 12 of these molecules using fragment-crystallisable scaffolds in CHO-S cells that are rich in SA. The viral surface protein of influenza A virus (IAV), haemagglutinin, binds SA for cell entry, and so we tested the activity of these compounds against this virus. Two of the sialylated Fc-molecules reduced IAV haemagglutination activity by up to 64-fold. However, the same molecules enhanced virus infectivity of A549 cultured cells. To explain the increased viral titres, we postulated that sialylated Fcs may be anti-inflammatory. However, sialylated Fc multimers were instead pro-inflammatory; they induced chemokine/cytokine responses from differentiated human THP-1 derived macrophages, including raised IL-8 and MIP-1/{beta}, that mimicked responses driven by universal type I interferon. Steric targeting of SA to block virus entry may therefore have unexpected effects in target cells that currently preclude their use for medical intervention.",

Recent studies reveal cGAS is frequently inhibited in cancer, and therapeutic targets to promote anti-tumor cGAS function remain elusive. c-Src is a proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase and is expressed at elevated levels in numerous cancers. Here, we demonstrate that c-Src expression in tumors from various cancers negatively correlates with innate immune gene expression and patient survival. We determine that c-Src restricts cGAS signaling in human cell lines through c-Src small molecule inhibitors, depletion, and overexpression. cGAS and c-Src interact in cells and in vitro, while c-Src directly inhibits cGAS enzymatic activity and DNA binding in a kinase-dependent manner. c-Src phosphorylates cGAS, and inhibition of cGAS Y248 phosphorylation partially reduces c-Src inhibition. Collectively, our study demonstrates that cGAS anti-tumor signaling is hindered by the proto-oncogene c-Src and describes how cancer-associated proteins can regulate the innate immune system.",

    "abstract": "Collective cell movements contribute to tissue development and repair, and spread metastatic disease. In epithelia, cohesive cell movements require reorganization of adherens junctions and the actomyosin cytoskeleton. However, the mechanisms that coordinate cell-cell adhesion and cytoskeletal remodelling during collective cell migration in vivo are unclear. We investigated the mechanisms of collective cell migration during wound healing in the Drosophila embryonic epidermis. Upon wounding, the cells adjacent to the wound internalize cell-cell adhesion molecules and polarize actin and the motor protein myosin II to form a supracellular cable around the wound that coordinates cell movements. The cable anchors at former tricellular junctions (TCJs) along the wound edge, and TCJs are reinforced during wound closure. We found that the small GTPase Rap1 was both necessary and sufficient for rapid wound repair. Rap1 promoted actomyosin polarization to the wound edge and E-cadherin accumulation at TCJs. Using embryos expressing a mutant form of the Rap1 effector Canoe/Afadin that cannot bind Rap1, we found that Rap1 signals through Canoe for adherens junction remodelling, but not for actomyosin cable assembly. Rap1 was necessary and sufficient for RhoA/Rho1 activation at the wound edge. Consistent with this, the RhoGEF Ephexin localized to the wound edge in a Rap1-dependent manner, and Ephexin was necessary for myosin polarization and rapid wound repair, but not for E-cadherin redistribution. Together, our data show that Rap1 coordinates the molecular rearrangements that drive embryonic wound healing and independently drives actomyosin cable assembly through Ephexin-Rho1, and E-cadherin redistribution through Canoe, thus enabling rapid collective cell migration in vivo.",

    "abstract": "During mitosis chromosomes assemble kinetochores in order to dynamically couple with spindle microtubules (Cheeseman, 2014; Musacchio & Desai, 2017). Kinetochores also function as signaling hubs directing mitotic progression by recruiting and controlling the fate of the Anaphase Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) activator CDC-20 (Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2017; Lara-Gonzalez, Pines, et al., 2021; Musacchio, 2015). Kinetochores either incorporate CDC-20 into checkpoint complexes that inhibit the APC/C or dephosphorylate CDC-20, which allows it to interact with and activate the APC/C (Kim et al., 2017; Lara-Gonzalez et al., 2017). The importance of these two CDC-20 fates likely depends on biological context. In somatic cells the major mechanism controlling mitotic progression is the spindle checkpoint. By contrast, progression through mitosis during the cell cycles of early embryos is largely checkpoint-independent (Clute & Masui, 1995; Duro & Nilsson, 2021; Gerhart et al., 1984; Zhang et al., 2015). Here, by manipulating CDC-20 phosphorylation status, we show that CDC-20 phosphoregulation controls mitotic duration in the C. elegans embryo and defines a checkpoint-independent temporal mitotic optimum for robust embryogenesis. Flux of CDC-20 through kinetochores for local dephosphorylation requires an ABBA motif on BUB-1 that directly interfaces with the structured WD40 domain of CDC-20 (Di Fiore et al., 2015; Diaz-Martinez et al., 2015; He et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2017). We show that a conserved \"STP\" motif in BUB-1 that docks the mitotic kinase PLK-1 (Qi et al., 2006) is also necessary to recruit CDC-20 to kinetochores and for timely mitotic progression. The kinase activity of PLK-1 is required for CDC-20 to localize to kinetochores and targets a site within the CDC-20-binding ABBA motif of BUB-1; phosphorylation of this site promotes BUB-1-CDC-20 interaction and mitotic progression. Thus, the BUB-1-bound pool of PLK-1 ensures timely mitosis during embryonic cell cycles by promoting CDC-20 recruitment to the vicinity of kinetochore-localized phosphatase activity.",

    "abstract": "Phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification that is utilised in many biological processes for the rapid and reversible regulation of protein localisation and activity. Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK-1) is essential for both mitotic and meiotic cell divisions, with key functions being conserved in eukaryotes. The roles and regulation of PLK-1 during mitosis have been well characterised. However, the discrete roles and regulation of PLK-1 during meiosis have remained obscure. Here, we used Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) oocytes to show that PLK-1 plays distinct roles in meiotic spindle assembly and/or stability, chromosome alignment and segregation, and polar body extrusion during meiosis I. Furthermore, by a combination of live imaging and biochemical analysis we identified the chromosomal recruitment mechanisms of PLK-1 during C. elegans oocyte meiosis. The spindle assembly checkpoint kinase BUB-1 directly recruits PLK-1 to the kinetochore and midbivalent while the chromosome arm population of PLK-1 depends on a direct interaction with the centromeric-associated protein CENP-CHCP-4. We found that perturbing both BUB-1 and CENP-CHCP-4 recruitment of PLK-1 leads to severe meiotic defects, resulting in highly aneuploid oocytes. Overall, our results shed light on the roles played by PLK-1 during oocyte meiosis and provide a mechanistic understanding of PLK-1 targeting to meiotic chromosomes.",

In Dictyostelium, macropinocytic cups form around domains of PIP3 in the plasma membrane and extend by actin polymerization. Using lattice light-sheet microscopy, we describe how cups originate, are supported by an F-actin scaffold and shaped by a ring of actin polymerization, created around PIP3 domains. How cups close is unknown. We find two ways: lip closure, where actin polymerization at the lip is re-directed inwards; and basal closure, where it stretches the cup, eventually causing membrane delamination and vesicle sealing. Cups grow as expanding waves of actin polymerization that travel across the cell surface, capturing new membrane. We propose that cups close when these waves stall. This  stalled wave hypothesis is tested through a conceptual model, where the interplay of forces from actin polymerization and membrane tension recreates many of our observations.",

    "abstract": "To respond to the world around them, animals rely on the input of a network of sensory organs distributed throughout the body. Distinct classes of sensory organ are specialized for the detection of specific stimuli such as strain, pressure, or taste. The features that underlie this specialization relate both to the neurons that innervate sensory organs and the accessory cells that comprise them. This diversity of cell types, both within and between sensory organs, raises two fundamental questions: what makes these cell types distinct from one another, and how is this diversity generated during development? To address these questions, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on a developing tissue that displays a wide variety of functionally and structurally distinct sensory organs: the first tarsal segment of the pupal male Drosophila melanogaster foreleg. We characterize the cellular landscape in which the sensory organs reside, identify a novel cell type that contributes to the construction of the neural lamella, and characterize the transcriptomic differences among support cells within and between sensory organs. We identify the genes that distinguish between mechanosensory and chemosensory neurons, resolve a combinatorial transcription factor code that defines four distinct classes of gustatory neuron and several types of mechanosensory neuron, and match the expression of sensory receptors to specific neuron classes. Collectively, our work identifies core genetic features of a variety of sensory organs and provides a rich, annotated resource for studying their development and function.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetries are essential for proper organization and function of organ systems. Genetic studies in deuterostomes have shown signaling through the Nodal/Smad2 pathway plays a key, conserved role in the establishment of body asymmetries. While Nodal signaling is required for the establishment of left-right asymmetry (LRA) across bilaterian species, little is known about the regulation of Nodal signaling in spiralians. Here, we identified orthologs of the egf-cfc gene, a master regulator of the Nodal pathway in vertebrates, in several invertebrate species, the first evidence of its presence in non-deuterostomes. Our functional experiments indicate that despite being present, egf-cfc does not play a role in the establishment LRA in gastropods. However, experiments in zebrafish suggest that a single amino acid mutation in the egf-cfc gene in the deuterostome common ancestor was the necessary step in inducing a gain-of-function in LRA regulation. This study shows that that the egf-cfc gene likely appeared in the bilaterian stem lineage, before being adopted as a master mechanism to regulate the Nodal pathway and the establishment of LRA in deuterostomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThere is a paucity of novel therapeutics for chronic heart failure (HF). Preclinical large animal models of chronic HF are crucial to translating fundamental discoveries. Canine models of ischemic cardiomyopathy are frequently utilized but are severely limited by competing needs to both induce sufficient muscle injury which results in an appropriately severe degree of left ventricular dysfunction yet to also minimize early mortality.\n\nMethodsTwenty-eight healthy adult dogs (30{+/-}4 kg, 15/28 male) underwent thoracotomy procedures followed by one of three types of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery ligations: Simple LAD (proximal and distal LAD ligation), LAD and Lateral (proximal and distal LAD, distal first diagonal, and proximal first obtuse marginal), and Total LAD Devascularization (TLD including the proximal and distal LAD, proximal aspects of the first, second, and third diagonals, and proximal aspects of first and second epicardial right ventricular branches of the LAD). Invasive and non-invasive hemodynamics were followed until attainment of chronic severe HF, which was achieved when left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was <40% and N-terminal prohormone B-type Natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) >900 pmol/L, both for two consecutive measurements.\n\nResultsOverall post-ligation early mortality (within 48 h of coronary ligation) was 18% (n=5/28), and the overall survival rate at 5 weeks post-ligation was 68% (n=19/28). At post-ligation week 1, LVEF was acutely reduced in all animals, from 54{+/-}4 to 38{+/-}1%, p<0.001. Beyond week 1, systolic function recovered over 3-4 weeks and then slowly declined as the left ventricle dilated and both systolic and diastolic function worsened. The magnitude of the initial decline in LVEF predicted ultimate HF development. Dogs with Simple LAD and LAD plus Lateral had excellent and limited survival at 48 hours (100% and 47%, respectively), yet the second group more likely developed chronic HF at 9 - 14 weeks (50% versus 57%, respectively). Dogs with TLD had both improved survival at 48 hours (90%) and excellent development of chronic HF (100%).\n\nConclusionsBy focusing on the LAD only and limiting collateral flow to it by ligating all side branches, optimal survival and attainment of chronic ischemic HF can be achieved in the canine heart.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary shift from a single-element ear, multi-element jaw to a multi-element ear, single-element jaw during the transition to crown mammals marks one of the most dramatic structural transformations in vertebrates. Research on this transformation has focused on mammalian middle-ear evolution, but a mandible comprised of only the dentary is equally emblematic of this evolutionary radiation. Here we show that the remarkably diverse jaw shapes of crown mammals are coupled with surprisingly stereotyped jaw stiffness. This strength-based morphofunctional regime has a genetic basis and allowed mammalian jaws to effectively resist deformation as they radiated into highly disparate forms with markedly distinct diets. The main functional consequences for the mandible of decoupling hearing and mastication were a trade-off between higher jaw stiffness versus decreased mechanical efficiency and speed compared to non-mammals. This fundamental and consequential shift in jaw form-function underpins the ecological and taxonomic diversification of crown mammals.",

    "abstract": "Spider venoms are a complex concoction of enzymes, polyamines, inorganic salts and disulfide-rich peptides (DRPs). Although DRPs are widely distributed and abundant, their evolutionary origin has remained elusive. This knowledge gap stems from the extensive molecular divergence of DRPs and a lack of sequence and structural data from diverse lineages. By evaluating DRPs under a comprehensive phylogenetic, structural and evolutionary framework, we have not only identified over 70 novel spider toxin superfamilies but also provide the first evidence for their common origin. We trace the origin of these toxin superfamilies to a primordial knot - the  Adi Shakti - nearly [~]375 MYA in the common ancestor of Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae. As these lineages constitute over 50% of the extant spiders, our findings provide fascinating insights into the early evolution and diversification of the spider venom arsenal. Reliance on a single molecular toxin scaffold by nearly all spiders is in complete contrast to most other venomous animals that have recruited into their venoms diverse toxins with independent origins. Moreover, by comparatively evaluating araneomorph and mygalomorph spiders that differentially depend on their ability to secrete silk for prey capture, we highlight the prominent role of predatory strategies in driving the evolution of spider venom.\n\nSignificance StatementVenoms are concoctions of biochemicals that function in concert to incapacitate prey or predators of venom-producing animals. Most venomous animals secrete a complex venom cocktail, constituted by toxins with independent evolutionary origins. In complete contrast, we trace the origin of diverse toxin superfamilies in spiders to a single molecular scaffold. The common origin of these disulphide-rich peptides that constitute three-quarters of nearly all spider venoms, therefore, represents a unique scenario of weaponization, where a single motif was recruited and extensively diversified to generate a plethora of superfamilies with distinct activities. Remarkably, the evolution of spider venom was also found to be driven by prey capture (i.e., reliance on silk versus venom) and venom deployment (predation or self-defence) strategies.",

    "abstract": "The effective population size (Ne) of an organism is expected to be generally proportional to the total number of individuals in a population. In parasites, we might expect the effective population size to be proportional to host population size and host body size, because both are expected to increase the number of parasite individuals. However, among other factors, parasite populations are sometimes so extremely subdivided that high levels of inbreeding may distort these predicted relationships. Here, we used whole-genome sequence data from dove parasites (71 feather louse species of the genus Columbicola) and phylogenetic comparative methods to study the relationship between parasite effective population size and host population size and body size.We found that parasite effective population size is largely explained by host body size but not host population size. These results suggest the potential local population size (infrapopulation or deme size) is more predictive of the long-term effective population size of parasites than is the total number of potential parasite infrapopulations (i.e., host individuals).\n\nImpact SummaryParasites, among Earths most diverse, threatened, and under-protected animals, play a central role in ecosystem function. The effective population size (Ne) of an organism has a profound impact on evolutionary processes, such as the relative contributions of selection and genetic drift to genomic change. Population size is also one of the most important parameters in conservation biology. For free-living organisms, it is expected that Ne is generally proportional to the total number of individuals in a population. However, for parasites, among other factors, populations are sometimes so extremely subdivided that high levels of inbreeding may distort these relationships. In this study, we used whole-genome sequence data from dove parasites and phylogenetic comparative methods to investigate the relationship between parasite effective population size (Ne) and host population size and body size. Our results revealed a positive relationship between parasite effective population size (Ne) and host body size, but not host population size. These results suggest that the size of parasite infrapopulations may be the most important factor when considering parasite effective population size, and have important implications for conservation.",

    "abstract": "Stem cell differentiation requires dramatic changes in gene expression and global remodeling of chromatin architecture. How and when chromatin remodels relative to the transcriptional, behavioral, and morphological changes during differentiation remain unclear, particularly in an intact tissue context. Here, we develop a quantitative pipeline which leverages fluorescently-tagged histones and longitudinal imaging to track large-scale chromatin compaction changes within individual cells in a live mouse. Applying this pipeline to epidermal stem cells, we reveal that cell-to-cell chromatin compaction heterogeneity within the stem cell compartment emerges independent of cell cycle status, and instead is reflective of differentiation status. Chromatin compaction state gradually transitions over days as differentiating cells exit the stem cell compartment. Moreover, establishing live imaging of keratin-10 nascent RNA, which marks the onset of stem cell differentiation, we find that keratin-10 transcription is highly dynamic and largely precedes the global chromatin compaction changes associated with differentiation. Together, these analyses reveal that stem cell differentiation involves dynamic transcriptional states and gradual chromatin rearrangement.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pilin nanowires are protein complexes, suggested to possess electroactive capabilities forming part of the cells bioenergetic programming. Their role is thought to be linked to facilitating electron transfer with the external environment to permit metabolism and cell-to-cell communication. There is a significant debate, with varying hypotheses as to the nature of the proteins currently lying between type-IV pilin-based nanowires and polymerised cytochrome-based filaments. Importantly, to date, there is a very limited structure-function analysis of these structures within whole bacteria. In this work, we engineered Cupriavidus necator H16, a model autotrophic organism to express differing aromatic modifications of type-IV pilus proteins to establish structure-function relationships on conductivity and the effects this has on pili structure. This was achieved via a combination of high-resolution PeakForce tunnelling atomic force microscopy (PeakForce TUNA) technology, alongside conventional electrochemical approaches enabling the elucidation of conductive nanowires emanating from whole bacterial cells for the first time. This work is the first example of functional type-IV pili protein nanowires produced under aerobic conditions using a CN chassis. This work has far-reaching consequences in understanding the basis of bio-electrical communication between cells and with their external environment.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=182 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/510814v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (90K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134d026org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d84f3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15379fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16d942c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Graphical abstract displaying theoretical PilA monomer models (left), PeakForce TUNA atomic force microscopy contact current images (right) of wild-type (top) and modified with increased tyrosine content (bottom) PilA filaments expressed by Cupriavidus necator H16 cells.",

Incubation of doxorubicin with GTP or dGTP at 37 {degrees}C or above yields a covalent product: the doxorubicin-GTP or -dGTP conjugate where a covalent bond is formed between the C14 position of doxorubicin and the 2-amino group of guanine. Density functional theory calculations show the feasibility of this spontaneous reaction. Fluorescence imaging studies demonstrate that the doxorubicin-GTP and -dGTP conjugates cannot enter nuclei although they rapidly accumulate in human SK-OV-3 and NCI/ADR-RES cells. Consequently, the doxorubicin-GTP and -dGTP conjugates are less cytotoxic than doxorubicin. We also demonstrate that doxorubicin binds to ATP, GTP, and other nucleotides with a dissociation constant (Kd) in the sub-millimolar range. Since human cells contain millimolar levels of ATP and GTP, these results suggest that doxorubicin may target ATP and GTP, energy molecules that support essential processes in living organisms.",

Auxin signaling activation is mediated through degradation of Auxin/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) family. Nitric oxide (NO) regulates diverse cellular bioactivities through S-nitrosylation of target protein at specific cysteine residues. NO-auxin interplay has an important role in regulation plant growth. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of how NO effects Aux/IAA proteins stability. Here we show that NO negatively regulates the IAA17 protein stability to repress auxin signaling. We found that NO directly inhibits IAA17 protein degradation. S-nitrosylation of IAA17 at Cys-70 represses the TIR-IAA17 co-receptor interaction to attenuate auxin responsiveness. Our data suggest a model in which S-nitrosylation of IAA17 at Cys-70 negatively regulates auxin signaling to effect plant development, providing a mechanism for redox-phytohormones networks.",

The algorithm underlying action-stopping is often described using the independent race model, where the race between independent go- and stop-processes determines whether one is able to stop. However, it is unclear whether humans have neural correlates of these processes. Here, using scalp potentials from three studies, we show that the mu (8-13 Hz) desynchronization over the contralateral motor cortex follows the predictions of a go-process: the activity builds up till an action is made. We also show that the low beta (13-20 Hz) activity over the frontal areas follows the predictions of a stop-process: the activity builds up after the stop signal and prior to the stopping latency. Using these neural correlates, we observed that: 1) The failure to stop mostly results from a rapid go-process, 2) The go-process seems to be influenced by the stop-process during the late stages of action-stopping, 3) Intrinsic prefrontal beta activity has a retardive effect on movement, 4) Violations of independence assumption in the failed stop trials may result from the activity of the stop-process. Future studies may use these neural correlates to resolve the mimicry between models of action-stopping.",

    "abstract": "Mouse models of CLN3 Batten disease, a rare lysosomal storage disorder with no cure, have improved our understanding of CLN3 biology and therapeutics through their ease of use and a consistent display of cellular pathology. However, the translatability of murine models is limited by disparities in anatomy, body size, life span, and inconsistent, subtle behavior deficits that can be difficult to detect in CLN3 mutant mouse models, limiting their utility in preclinical studies. Here we present a longitudinal characterization of a novel miniswine model of CLN3 disease that recapitulates the most common human pathogenic variant, an exon 7-8 deletion (CLN3{Delta}ex7/8). Progressive pathology and neuron loss is observed in various regions of the CLN3{Delta}ex7/8 miniswine brain and retina. Additionally, mutant miniswine present with vision impairment and motor abnormalities, similar to deficits seen in human patients. Taken together, the CLN3{Delta}ex7/8 miniswine model shows consistent and progressive Batten disease pathology and behavioral impairment mirroring clinical presentation, demonstrating its value in studying the role of CLN3 and safety/efficacy of novel disease modifying therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Mice are the most commonly used model animals for itch research and for development of antiitch drugs. Most labs manually quantify mouse scratching behavior to assess itch intensity. This process is labor-intensive and limits large-scale genetic or drug screenings. In this study, we developed a new system, Scratch-AID (Automatic Itch Detection), which could automatically identify and quantify mouse scratching behavior with high accuracy. Our system included a custom-designed videotaping box to ensure high-quality and replicable mouse behavior recording and a convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN) trained with frame-labeled mouse scratching behavior videos, induced by nape injection of chloroquine (CQ). The best trained network achieved 97.6% recall and 96.9% precision on previously unseen test videos. Remarkably, Scratch-AID could reliably identify scratching behavior in other major mouse itch models, including the acute cheek model, the histaminergic model, and a chronic itch model. Moreover, our system detected significant differences in scratching behavior between control and mice treated with an anti-itch drug. Taken together, we have established a novel deep learning-based system that is ready to replace manual quantification for mouse scratching behavior in different itch models and for drug screening.",

    "abstract": "Dietary Restriction (DR) and rapamycin both increase lifespan across a number of taxa. Despite this positive effect on lifespan and other aspects of health, reductions in some physiological functions have been reported for DR and rapamycin has been used as an immunosuppressant. Perhaps surprisingly, both interventions have been suggested to improve immune function and delay immunosenescence. The immune system is complex and consists of many components. Therefore, arguably, the most holistic measurement of immune function is survival from an acute pathogenic infection. We reanalysed published post-infection short-term survival data of mice (n=1223 from 23 studies comprising 46 effect sizes involving DR (n=17) and rapamycin treatment (n=29) and analysed these results using meta-analysis. Rapamycin treatment significantly increased post infection survival rate (lnHR=-0.72; CI=-1.17, -0.28; p=0.0015). In contrast, DR reduced post-infection survival (lnHR=0.80; CI=0.08, 1.52; p=0.03). Importantly, the overall effect size of rapamycin treatment was significantly lower (P<0.001) than the estimate from DR studies, suggesting opposite effects on immune function. Our results show that immunomodulation caused by rapamycin treatment is beneficial to the survival from acute infection. For DR our results are based on a smaller number of studies, but do warrant caution as they indicate possible immune costs of DR. Our quantitative synthesis suggests that the geroprotective effects of rapamycin extend to the immune system and warrants further clinical trials of rapamycin to boost immunity in humans.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveIt is believed that intestinal recruitment of monocytes from Crohns Disease (CD) patients who carry NOD2 risk alleles may repeatedly give rise to recruitment of pathogenic macrophages. We investigated an alternative possibility that NOD2 may rather inhibit their differentiation from intravasating monocytes.\n\nDesignThe monocyte fate decision was examined by using germ-free mice, mixed bone marrow chimeras and a culture system yielding macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs). We next asked whether Nod2 in either monocytes or tissue macrophages have distinct resolving properties in colitis.\n\nResultsDespite a similar abundance of monocytes, the intestinal frequency of mo-DCs from Nod2-deficient mice was lowered independently of the changes in the gut microbiota that are caused by Nod2 deficiency. Similarly, the pool of mo-DCs was poorly reconstituted with mobilized bone marrow Nod2-deficient cells. The use of pharmacological inhibitors revealed that activated NOD2 at an early stage of development dominantly inhibits mTOR-mediated macrophage differentiation in a TNFalpha-dependent manner. These observations were supported by the identification of a TNFalpha-dependent response to MDP that is specifically lost in CD14-expressing blood cells bearing the frameshift mutation in NOD2. Accordingly, loss of NOD2 in monocytes lowers glycolytic reserve, CD115 expression and pro-resolving features. Dietary intake of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) agonists that promotes mo-DCs generation improves colitis in Nod2-deficient mice to the same extent as what is observed upon macrophage ablation of Nod2.\n\nConclusionNOD2 negatively regulates a macrophage developmental program through a feed-forward loop that could be exploited for overcoming resistance to anti-TNF therapy in CD.\n\nSignificance of this studyO_ST_ABSWhat is already known about this subject?C_ST_ABSO_LILoss of NOD2 function is predisposing to Crohns disease.\nC_LIO_LIRapamycin, a serine/THR kinase inhibitor of mammalian target (mTOR) has been reported as potentially effective treatment in discrete subset of CD patients with refractory colitis.\nC_LIO_LIThe NOD2 protein promotes the chemokine CCL2-dependent recruitment of inflammatory monocytes in response to tissue injury.\nC_LIO_LIAn accumulation of CCR2-expressing monocytes and inflammatory macrophages is observed within the intestinal mucosa of CD patients including those resistant to anti-TNF therapy.\nC_LIO_LIActivated NOD2 enhances proinflammatory activity of CX3CR1intLy6Chi effector monocytes.\nC_LIO_LIThe monocyte fate toward mo-DCs is orchestrated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor.\nC_LI\n\nWhat are the new findings?O_LINOD2 has a hierarchically dominant negative role on the mTORC-driven monocyte conversion to inflammatory macrophages independently of the changes in the gut microbiota that are caused by Nod2 deficiency.\nC_LIO_LIA defect in monocytes fate at the early stage allow the expansion of pathogenic macrophages in Nod2-deficient mice at the expense of mo-DC.\nC_LIO_LIAdoptive transfer of Nod2-deficient monocytes into wild-type mice was sufficient to exacerbate DSS-induced intestinal damage.\nC_LIO_LIThe glycolytic reserve of monocytes and their ability to respond to M-CSF is lowered upon loss of NOD2 signalling.\nC_LIO_LIDeletion of NOD2 in macrophage improves colitis to the same extent as dietary supplementation of AHR agonist in mice.\nC_LIO_LIThe recognition of the gut microbiota by NOD2 is required for de novo reconstitution of mo-DCs in the lamina propria of the murine intestine, while having minimal effect on the mobilization of their precursors to the intestinal mucosa.\nC_LI\n\nHow might it impact on clinical practice in the foreseeable future?This study might contribute to the development of novel mTORC-based therapeutic strategies for improving the response to biologics by restoring the ability of circulating monocytes to reconstitute the pool of mo-DCs during homeostatic turnover and upon tissue injury. It may thereby prevent the accumulation of pathogenic macrophages in patients with loss-of-function NOD2 alleles, which fail to respond to anti-TNF and are at greater risk of developing stricturing disease.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAll motor commands flow through motoneurons, which entrain control of their innervated muscle fibers, forming a motor unit (MU). Owing to the high fidelity of action potentials within MUs, their discharge profiles detail the organization of ionotropic excitatory/inhibitory as well as metabotropic neuromodulatory commands to motoneurons. Neuromodulatory inputs (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin) enhance motoneuron excitability and facilitate persistent inward currents (PICs). PICs introduce quantifiable properties in MU discharge profiles by augmenting depolarizing currents upon activation (i.e., PIC amplification) and facilitating discharge at lower levels of excitatory input than required for recruitment (i.e., PIC prolongation). Approach: Here, we introduce a novel geometric approach to estimate neuromodulatory and inhibitory contributions to MU discharge through exploiting discharge non-linearities introduced by PIC amplification during time-varying linear tasks. In specific, we quantify the deviation from linear discharge (\"brace height\") and the rate of change in discharge (i.e., acceleration slope, attenuation slope, angle). We further characterize these metrics on a simulated motoneuron pool with known excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory inputs and on human MUs (Tibialis Anterior: 1448, Medial Gastrocnemius: 2100, Soleus: 1062, First Dorsal Interosseus: 2296).\n\nMain ResultIn the simulated motor pool, we found brace height and attenuation slope to consistently indicate changes in neuromodulation and the pattern of inhibition (excitation-inhibition coupling), respectively, whereas the paired MU analysis ({Delta}F) was dependent on both neuromodulation and inhibition pattern. Furthermore, we provide estimates of these metrics in human MUs and show comparable variability in {Delta}F and brace height measures in MUs matched across multiple trials.\n\nSignificanceSpanning both datasets, we found brace height quantification to provide an intuitive method for achieving graded estimates of neuromodulatory and inhibitory drive to MUs on a single unit level. This complements common techniques and provides an avenue for decoupling changes in the level of neuromodulatory and pattern of inhibitory motor commands.",

    "abstract": "Short, cysteine-rich peptides can exist in stable or metastable structural ensembles due to the number of possible patterns of formation of their disulfide bonds. One interesting subset of this peptide group is the coonotoxins, which are produced by aquatic snails in the family Conidae. The {micro} conotoxins, which are antagonists and blockers of the voltage-gated sodium channel, exist in a folding spectrum: on one end of the spectrum are more hirudin-like folders, which form disulfide bonds and then reshuffle them, leading to an ensemble of kinetically trapped isomers-and on the other end are more BPTI-like folders-which form the native disulfide bonds one by one in a particular order, leading to a preponderance of conformations existing in a single stable state. In this article, we employ the composite diffusion map approach to study the unified free energy surface of pre-folding {micro}-conotoxin equilibrium. We identify the two most important nonlinear collective modes of the unified folding landscape and demonstrate that in the absence of their disulfides, the conotoxins can be thought of as largely disordered polymers. A small increase in the number of hydrophobic residues in the protein shifts the free energy landscape towards hydrophobically collapsed coil conformations responsible for cysteine proximity in hirudin-like folders, compared to semi-extended coil conformations with more distal cysteines in BPTI-like folders. Overall, this work sheds important light on the folding processes and free energy landscapes of cysteinerich peptides and demonstrates the extent to which sequence and length contribute to these landscapes.",

While elevated levels of the efflux pump P-gp are associated with in vitro resistance to romidepsin, this mechanism does not translate to the clinic. We developed a romidepsin-resistant cell line with a resistance mechanism independent of P-gp function that acts upstream of the deacetylation process. We found that expression of the methyltransferase METTL7A is necessary for resistance, and that expression of METTL7A in naive cells can drive resistance to thiol-containing HDACis. We demonstrate that METTL7A can methylate romidesin in vitro and that the ability of METTL7A to drive resistance to thiol-containing HDACis can be blocked by the methyltransferase inhibitor DCMB. Our data supports a model whereby exposure of cells to romidepsin selects for upregulation of the methyltransferase METTL7A, which in turn modifies the zinc-binding thiol, inactivating the drug.",

    "abstract": "With high energy consumption and low energy storage, the brain is highly reliant on continuous cerebral blood flow (CBF) that delivers substrates to maintain proper function, which is compromised after a stroke. The current study explores the overlapping roles played by two important modulators of cerebrovascular tone, rho-kinase (ROCK) and endogenous sex hormones, in the acute CBF responses to a photothrombotic (PT) model of ischemic stroke in ROCK2+/- mice and wild-type (WT) littermates. To remove endogenous hormones, male mice were gonadectomized and female mice were ovariectomized, whereas control (\"intact\") animals received a sham surgery prior to stroke induction. Intact WT males showed a delayed drop in CBF compared to intact WT females, where maximal CBF drop was observed 48 hours following stroke. Gonadectomy in males did not alter this response, however ovariectomy in females produced a \"male-like\" response. Intact ROCK2+/- males also showed such phenotypic response, which was not altered by gonadectomy. Alternatively, intact ROCK2+/- females showed a striking difference in CBF values compared to intact WT females, where they displayed higher CBF values immediately post-stroke and also showed a maximal CBF drop 48 hours post-stroke, which was not altered by ovariectomy. Overall, there is a marked sex difference in acute CBF responses to PT stroke, which appears to be mediated by endogenous female sex hormones and ROCK2. This study reveals important sex-differences and the involvement of ROCK2 in acute CBF responses to PT stroke in mice.\n\nSignificance StatementThere are very few mechanistic investigations on disparities between sexes in post-stroke CBF outcome. Rho-kinase, an important regulator of vascular tone, has only been explored in males in terms of its modulation of CBF following stroke. Both rho-kinase and endogenous female sex hormones have a converging role on the regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an important modulator of vascular tone. Rho-kinase is thought to elicit its neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke through eNOS, however this has never been investigated in both sexes. Elucidating the cellular and molecular bases of sex differences in cerebrovascular pathophysiology is vital for understanding the origins of stroke outcomes, and for designing novel therapeutic strategies to promote functional recovery in both women and men.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a tragic neurodegenerative disease affecting more than 5 million Americans. Circadian disruptions impact nearly all AD patients, with reversal of sleep/wake cycles and agitation in the evening being common disturbances that manifest early in disease. These alterations support a role for circadian dysfunction as a driver of AD, emphasizing a critical need to investigate the therapeutic potential of circadian-modulating interventions. One of the most powerful regulators of the circadian system is the daily feed/fast cycle. Here we show that time-restricted feeding (TRF) without caloric restriction, improved key disease components including behavior, disease pathology and transcription in the APP23 mouse model of Alzheimers disease. We found that TRF had the remarkable capability of simultaneously reducing amyloid deposition, increasing A{beta}42 clearance, improving sleep and hyperactivity, and normalizing transcription of circadian, AD and neuroinflammation-associated genes in APP23 mice. Thus, our study unveils for the first time that circadian modulation through timed feeding has far-reaching effects beyond metabolism and affects the brain as the substrate for neurodegeneration. Since the pleiotropic effects of TRF can substantially modify disease trajectory, this intervention has immediate translational value, addressing the crucial need for accessible approaches to reduce or halt AD progression.",

However, the role of local cholinergic innervation of the striatum in behaviors requiring precise timing has not been specifically investigated. Here, we recorded from presumed striatal cholinergic interneurons, identified as tonically active neurons (TANs), in two male rhesus monkeys performing self-initiated movements after specified learned time intervals have elapsed since a visual cue. We found that 38% of all recorded TANs responded to the cue with a pause in firing and the strength of these responses could be modulated according to the duration of the interval being timed and the accuracy of time estimates. By examining the TAN response to the reward itself and by recording from TANs during a Pavlovian procedure in which no action was required, we found evidence that TAN activity modulation may potentially reflect differences in the animals prediction of reward. Thus, besides their well-known role in predicting and detecting rewarding events, TANs may generate signals related to the processing of time. Our findings suggest a role of the local cholinergic circuitry in the representation of time within the striatum.",

It can be quantified by properly fitting the isotropic compartment of the magnetic resonance (MR) signal in diffusion-sensitized sequences. Using N = 287 healthy subjects aged 25-94, this study examines in detail the evolution of the FWVF in the human brain WM across the adult lifespan, which has been previously reported to exhibit a positive trend. We found evidence of a noticeably non-linear gain after the sixth decade of life, with a region-specific variate and varying change rate of the FWVF parameter with age, at the same time a heteroskedastic pattern across the adult lifespan is suggested. On the other hand, the FW-compensated MR signal leads to a region-dependent flattened age-related evolution of the mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA), along with a considerable reduction in their variability, as compared to standard studies conducted over the raw MR signal. This way, our study provides a new perspective on the trajectory-based assessment of the brain and explains the source of the variations observed in FA and MD parameters across the lifespan with previous studies with the standard diffusion tensor imaging.",

    "abstract": "Plant recruit diverse microbial communities from the soil biota. Inter-microbial interactions and connectivity in the root microbiome could play essential roles in plant health by promoting resistance to soil-borne pathogens. Yet, understanding these interactions under field conditions is still scarce. Using a strawberry crop model, we characterized the prokaryotic and fungal communities in the rhizosphere and roots of three strawberry cultivars displaying varying resistance degrees to the soil-borne fungal pathogen Macrophomina phaseolina. We tested the hypothesis that resistant cultivars assemble distinct bacterial and fungal communities that foster microbial connectivity and mediate disease resistance. Our results show that the soil-borne pathogen, M. phaseolina, does not perturb the root microbiome of the strawberry cultivars. Microbiome comparative analysis indicated that the highly susceptible cultivar, Sweet Ann, assembles a distinct microbiome that shows reduced network connectivity, whereas more resistant cultivars were enriched in potential beneficial microbes and showed higher network connectivity. Collectively, these results suggest the role of plant genetic traits in the assembly of beneficial microbiome members. Our study reinforces the eminent role of the plant microbiome as trait of selection in breeding programs and stresses further understandings of the genetic and biological mechanisms that mediate microbiome assembly. Uncovering these mechanisms will be key for future plant breeding programs.",

    "abstract": "DNA double-strand breaks are repaired by multiple pathways, including non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). The balance of these pathways is dependent on the local chromatin context, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. By combining knockout screening with a dual MMEJ:NHEJ reporter inserted in 19 different chromatin environments, we identified dozens of DNA repair proteins that modulate pathway balance dependent on the local chromatin state. Proteins that favor NHEJ mostly synergize with euchromatin, while proteins that favor MMEJ generally synergize with distinct types of heterochromatin. BRCA2 is an example of the former, which is corroborated by chromatin-dependent shifts in mutation patterns of BRCA2-/- cancer genomes. These results uncover a complex network of proteins that regulate MMEJ:NHEJ balance in a chromatin context-dependent manner.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYA multiplexed screen reveals how dozens of proteins sense the local chromatin context to tune the balance between two DNA repair pathways.",

    "abstract": "Current in vitro models of developmental blood formation lack spatiotemporal coherence and weakly replicate the hematopoietic microenvironment. Developmentally-appropriate models can enhance understanding of infant acute myeloid leukemia (infAML), which putatively originates in utero and has 50% age-unique genetic events, suggesting unique biology. The commonest genetic abnormality unique to infants involves homeobox gene MNX1, whose leukemogenic mechanisms remain unknown. Recently, 3D self-organising embryonic stem cell (SC)-based gastruloids have shown promise in recapitulating embryonic events with time/space precision. Herein, we report a hemogenic gastruloid (haemGx) system that captures multi-wave blood formation, progenitor specification from hemogenic endothelium (HE), and approximates generation of hematopoietic SC precursors. Enforced MNX1 expression in haemGx promotes HE formation, perturbs endothelial-to-hemogenic transition, and critically achieves transformation, generating myeloid colonies which display MNX1 AML signatures. By combining functional assays with single-cell transcriptomics, we establish the haemGx as a new model of normal and leukemic embryonic hematopoiesis amenable to mechanistic exploration.",

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients have a poor prognosis and few treatment options. Mouse models of TNBC are important for development of new targeted therapies, but few TNBC mouse models exist. Here, we developed a novel TNBC murine model by mimicking two common TNBC mutations with high co-occurrence: amplification of the oncogene MYC and deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN. This Myc;Ptenfl murine model develops TN mammary tumors that display histological and molecular features commonly found in human TNBC. We performed deep omic analyses on Myc;Ptenfl tumors including machine learning for morphologic features, bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, multiplex immunohistochemistry and single-cell phenotyping. Through comparison with human TNBC, we demonstrated that this new genetic mouse model develops mammary tumors with differential survival that closely resemble the inter- and intra-tumoral and microenvironmental heterogeneity of human TNBC; providing a unique pre-clinical tool for assessing the spectrum of patient TNBC biology and drug response.\n\nStatement of significanceThe development of cancer models that mimic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) microenvironment complexities is critical to develop effective drugs and enhance disease understanding. This study addresses a critical need in the field by identifying a murine model that faithfully mimics human TNBC heterogeneity and establishing a foundation for translating preclinical findings into effective human clinical trials.",

    "abstract": "Cells use surface receptors to detect extra-cellular ligands (e.g., growth factors or cytokines) and engender signaling cascades. We explore the effect of cell-to-cell variability in receptor subunit copy number for cells responding to{gamma} c cytokines (e.g., IL-2, IL-7 and IL-15). We find that primary T cells expressing higher levels of the common{gamma} c receptor chain have weaker responses to IL-7, both in terms of lowered STAT5 phosphorylation amplitude and higher EC50. A mathematical model that accounts for abundance imbalance (e.g., insufficient expression of JAK kinases compared to the number of receptors, or{gamma} c competition for other receptor subunit chains) predicts the formation of non-signalling complexes, consistent with the observed cellular behaviour. This type of built-in limit on signaling responses illustrates how phenotypic heterogeneity generates biological functional diversity.\n\nSignificance StatementCells rely on cytokines to coordinate their activation, differentiation, proliferation and survival. In particular,{gamma} c cytokines (interleukins IL-2, 4, 7, 9, 15, and 21) regulate the fate of leukocytes. The signaling cascade induced by these cytokines is relatively simple, and involves the phosphorylation of receptor-associated Janus-like kinases (JAK). Here, we explore the cell-to-cell variability of cytokine responses in primary mouse T cells, and find a paradoxical and quantitative imprint of receptor expression levels and other signaling components. For instance, high abundance of the common{gamma} c chain reduces cytokine responses (both in terms of signaling amplitudes and characteristic cytokine concentrations triggering 50% of the response). We develop mathematical models to quantify how limited abundances of signaling components (e.g., JAK or other cytokine receptor subunit chains) may explain our experimental observations. We conclude by generalizing this observation of cell-to-cell signaling variability to other ligand-receptor-kinase systems.",

    "abstract": "Cells continuously interact with their environment, detect its changes and generate responses accordingly. This requires interpreting the variations and, in many occasions, producing changes in gene expression. In this paper we use information theory and a simple transcription model to analyze the extent to which the resulting gene expression is able to identify and assess the intensity of extracellular stimuli when they are encoded in the amplitude, duration or frequency of a transcription factors nuclear concentration. We find that the maximal information transmission is, for the three codifications, ~ 1.5 - 1.8 bits, i.e., approximately 3 ranges of input strengths can be distinguished in all cases. The types of promoters that yield maximum transmission for the three modes are all similarly fast and have a high activation threshold. The three input modulation modes differ, however, in the sensitivity to changes in the parameters that characterize the promoters, with frequency modulation being the most sensitive and duration modulation, the least. This turns out to be key for signal identification. Namely, we show that, because of this sensitivity difference, it is possible to find promoter parameters that yield an information transmission within 90% of its maximum value for duration or amplitude modulation and less than 1 bit for frequency modulation. The reverse situation cannot be found within the framework of a single promoter transcription model. This means that pulses of transcription factors in the nucleus can selectively activate the promoter that is tuned to respond to frequency modulations while prolonged nuclear accumulation would activate several promoters at the same time. Thus, frequency modulation is better suited than the other encoding modes to allow the identification of external stimuli without requiring other mediators of the transduction.",

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma is the most common yet deadliest primary brain cancer1. The neural behavior of glioblastoma, including the formation of synaptic circuitry and tumor microtubes, is increasingly understood to be pivotal for disease manifestation2-8. Nonetheless, the few approved treatments for glioblastoma target its oncological nature, while its neural vulnerabilities remain incompletely mapped and clinically unexploited. Here, we systematically survey the neural molecular dependencies and cellular heterogeneity across glioblastoma patients and diverse model systems. In 27 patient tumour samples taken directly after surgery, we identify a spectrum of cancer cell morphologies indicative of poor prognosis and discover a set of repurposable neuroactive drugs with consistent anti-glioblastoma efficacy. Glioblastoma cells exhibit functional dependencies on highly expressed neuroactive drug targets, while interpretable molecular machine learning (COSTAR) reveals their downstream convergence on AP-1-driven tumour suppression. This drug-target connectivity signature is confirmed by highly accurate in silico drug screening on >1 million compounds using COSTAR, as well as by multi-omic profiling of drug-treated glioblastoma cells. Thus, Ca2+-driven AP-1 pathway induction represents a tumour-intrinsic vulnerability at the intersection of oncogenesis and neural activity-dependent signaling. Opportunities for clinical translation of this neural vulnerability are epitomized by the antidepressant Vortioxetine synergizing with current standard of care treatments in vivo. Together, the results presented here provide a mechanistic foundation and conceptual framework for the treatment of glioblastoma based on its neural origins.",

    "abstract": "Estrogen receptor  (ER) mutations occur in up to 30% of metastatic ER-positive breast cancers. Recent data has shown that ER mutations impact the expression of thousands of genes not typically regulated by wildtype ER. While the majority of these altered genes can be explained by constant activity of mutant ER or genomic changes such as altered ER binding and chromatin accessibility, as much as 33% remain unexplained, indicating the potential for post-transcriptional effects. Here we explored the role of microRNAs in mutant ER-driven gene regulation and identified several microRNAs that are dysregulated in ER mutant cells. These differentially regulated microRNAs target a significant portion of mutant-specific genes involved in key cellular processes. When the activity of microRNAs is altered using mimics or inhibitors, significant changes are observed in gene expression and cellular proliferation related to mutant ER. An in-depth evaluation of miR-301b led us to discover an important role for PRKD3 in the proliferation of ER mutant cells. Our findings show that microRNAs contribute to mutant ER gene regulation and cellular effects in breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms that prevent accidental degradation of healthy mitochondria by the PINK1/Parkin mitophagy pathway are poorly understood. On the surface of damaged mitochondria, PINK1 accumulates and acts as the input signal to a positive feedback loop of Parkin recruitment, which in turn promotes mitochondrial degradation via mitophagy. However, PINK1 is also present on healthy mitochondria where it could errantly recruit Parkin and thereby activate this positive feedback loop. Here, we quantitatively mapped the relationship between PINK1 input levels and Parkin recruitment dynamics using live-cell microscopy and mathematical modeling. We found that Parkin is recruited to the mitochondria only if PINK1 levels exceed a threshold and only after a delay that is inversely proportional to PINK1 levels. The threshold and delay provide a \"two-factor authentication\" step for PINK1/Parkin activation. These properties arise from the PINK1/Parkin circuit topology and provide a mechanism for cells to assess damage signals before committing to mitophagy.",

    "abstract": "A major unresolved question in the origin and evolution of life is whether a continuous path from geochemical precursors to the majority of molecules in the biosphere can be reconstructed from modern day biochemistry. Here we simulated the emergence of ancient metabolic networks and identified a feasible path from simple geochemically plausible precursors (e.g., phosphate, sulfide, ammonia, simple carboxylic acids, and metals) using only known biochemical reactions and models of primitive coenzymes. We find that purine synthesis constitutes a bottleneck for metabolic expansion, and that non-autocatalytic phosphoryl coupling agents are necessary to enable expansion from geochemistry to modern metabolic networks. Our model predicts punctuated phases of metabolic evolution characterized by the emergence of small molecule coenzymes (e.g., ATP, NAD+, FAD). Early phases in the resulting expansion are associated with enzymes that are metal dependent and structurally symmetric, supporting models of early biochemical evolution. This expansion trajectory produces distinct hypotheses regarding the timing and mode of metabolic pathway evolution, including a late appearance of methane metabolisms and oxygenic photosynthesis consistent with the geochemical record. The concordance between biological and geological analysis suggests that this trajectory provides a plausible evolutionary history for the vast majority of core biochemistry.",

    "abstract": "Gene expression data of cell cultures is commonly measured in biological and medical studies to understand cellular decision-making in various conditions. Metabolism, affected but not solely determined by the expression, is much more difficult to measure experimentally. Thus, finding a reliable method to predict cell metabolism for given expression data will greatly benefit model-aided metabolic engineering. We have developed such a pipeline that can explore cellular fluxomics from expression data, using only a high-quality genome-scale metabolic model. This is done through two main steps: first, construct a protein-constrained metabolic model by integrating protein and enzyme information into the metabolic model. Secondly, overlay the expression data onto the modified model using a new two-step non-convex and convex optimization formulation, resulting in context-specific models with optionally calibrated rate constants. The resulting model computes proteomes and intracellular flux states that are consistent with the measured transcriptomes. Therefore, it provides detailed cellular insights that are difficult to glean individually from the omic data or metabolic models alone. As a case study, we apply the pipeline to interpret triacylglycerol (TAG) overproduction by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, using time-course RNA-Seq data. The pipeline allows us to compute C. reinhardtii metabolism under nitrogen deprivation and metabolic shifts after an acetate boost. We also suggest a list of possible  bottlenecking proteins that need to be overexpressed to increase the TAG accumulation rate, as well as discussing other TAG-overproduction strategies.",
