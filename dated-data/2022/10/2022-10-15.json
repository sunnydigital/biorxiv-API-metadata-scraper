    "abstract": "Calcium imaging technique provides the advantages in monitoring large population of neuronal activities simultaneously. However, it lacks the signal quality provided by neural spike recording in traditional electrophysiology. To address this issue, we developed a supervised data-driven approach to extract spike information from calcium signals. We propose the ENS2 (effective and efficient neural networks for spike inference from calcium signals) system for spike-rate and spike-event predictions using raw calcium inputs based on U-Net deep neural network. When testing on a large, ground truth public database, it consistently outperformed state-of-the-arts algorithms in both spike-rate and spike-event predictions with reduced computational load. We further demonstrated that ENS2 can be applied to analyses of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex neurons. We concluded that it would be a versatile inference system that benefits diverse neuroscience studies.",

    "abstract": "Synthetic glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, have been used as treatment for many immune conditions, such as asthma and more recently severe COVID-19. Single cell data can capture more fine-grained details on transcriptional variability and dynamics to gain a better understanding of the molecular underpinnings of inter-individual variation in drug response. Here, we used single cell RNA-seq to study the dynamics of the transcriptional response to glucocorticoids in activated Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells from 96 African American children. We employed novel statistical approaches to calculate a mean-independent measure of gene expression variability and a measure of transcriptional response pseudotime. Using these approaches, we demonstrated that glucocorticoids reverse the effects of immune stimulation on both gene expression mean and variability. Our novel measure of gene expression response dynamics, based on the diagonal linear discriminant analysis, separated individual cells by response status on the basis of their transcriptional profiles and allowed us to identify different dynamic patterns of gene expression along the response pseudotime. We identified genetic variants regulating gene expression mean and variability, including treatment-specific effects, and demonstrated widespread genetic regulation of the transcriptional dynamics of the gene expression response.",

    "abstract": "The accurate prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity is critical for the success of computer-aided drug discovery. However, the accuracy of current scoring functions is usually unsatisfactory due to their rough approximation or sometimes even omittance of many factors involved in protein-ligand binding. For instance, the intrinsic dynamic of the protein-ligand binding state is usually disregarded in scoring function because these rapid binding affinity prediction approaches are only based on a representative complex structure of the protein and ligand in the binding state. That is, the dynamic protein-ligand binding complex ensembles are simplified as a static snapshot in calculation. In this study, two novel features were proposed for characterizing the dynamic properties of protein-ligand binding based on the static structure of the complex, which is expected to be a valuable complement to the current scoring functions. The two features demonstrate the geometry-shape matching between a protein and a ligand as well as the dynamic stability of protein-ligand binding. We further combined these two novel features with several classical scoring functions to develop a binary classification model called DyScore that uses the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm to classify compound poses as binders or non-binders. We have found that DyScore achieves state-of-the-art performance in distinguishing active and decoy ligands on both enhanced DUD dataset and external test sets with both proposed novel features showing significant contributions to the improved performance. Especially, DyScore exhibits superior performance on early recognition, a crucial requirement for success in virtual screening and de novo drug design.

    "abstract": "Neurons in frontal and parietal cortex encode task variables during decision-making, but causal manipulations of the two regions produce strikingly different results. For example, silencing the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) in rats and monkeys produces minimal effects in perceptual decisions requiring integration of sensory evidence, but silencing frontal cortex profoundly impairs the same decisions. Here, we tested the causal roles of the rat frontal orienting field (FOF) and PPC in economic choice under risk. On each trial, rats chose between a lottery and a small but guaranteed surebet. The magnitude of the lottery was independently varied across trials and was indicated to the rat by the pitch of an auditory cue. As in perceptual decisions, both unilateral and bilateral PPC muscimol inactivations produced minimal effects. FOF inactivations produced substantial changes in behavior even though our task had no working memory component. We quantified control and bilateral inactivation behavior with a multi-agent model consisting of a mixture of a  rational utility-maximizing agent (U = V{rho}) with two  habitual agents that either choose surebet or lottery. Effects of FOF silencing were best accounted for by a decrease in{rho} , the exponent of the utility function. The decrease in{rho} could be parsimoniously explained by a dynamical model where the FOF is part of a network that represents the value of the lottery to compare against a remembered boundary representing the value of the surebet. This dynamical model predicted that neurons in the FOF should increase their activity with increasing lottery values. In line with our predictions, single neurons recorded in the FOF encoded the value of the lottery even when controlling for choice. These results together demonstrate that FOF is a critical node in the neural circuit for decision under risk.",

    "abstract": "In a variety of aposematic species, the conspicuousness of an individuals warning signal and the quantity of its chemical defence are positively correlated. This apparent honest signalling is predicted by resource competition models which assume that the production and maintenance of aposematic defences compete for access to antioxidant molecules that have dual functions as pigments and in protecting against oxidative damage. We raised monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) on their milkweed host-plants (Apocynaceae) with increasing quantities of cardenolides to test whether (1) the sequestration of secondary defences is associated with costs in the form of oxidative lipid damage and reduced antioxidant defences; and (2) that reduced oxidative state can decrease the capacity of individuals to produce aposematic displays. In male monarchs conspicuousness was explained by an interaction between oxidative damage and sequestration: males with high levels of oxidative damage become less conspicuous with increased sequestration of cardenolides, whereas those with low oxidative damage become more conspicuous with increased levels of cardenolides. There was no significant effect of oxidative damage or concentration of sequestered cardenolides on female conspicuousness. Our results demonstrate a physiological linkage between the production of coloration and protection from autotoxicity, and differential costs of signalling in monarch butterflies.",

    "abstract": "For animals to navigate an uncertain world, their brains need to estimate uncertainty at the timescales of sensations and actions. Sampling-based algorithms afford a theoretically-grounded framework for probabilistic inference in neural circuits, but it remains unknown how one can implement fast sampling algorithms in biologically-plausible spiking networks. Here, we propose to leverage the population geometry, controlled by the neural code and the neural dynamics, to implement fast samplers in spiking neural networks. We first show that two classes of spiking samplers--efficient balanced spiking networks that simulate Langevin sampling, and networks with probabilistic spike rules that implement Metropolis-Hastings sampling--can be unified within a common framework. We then show that careful choice of population geometry, corresponding to the natural space of parameters, enables rapid inference of parameters drawn from strongly-correlated high-dimensional distributions in both networks. Our results suggest design prin-ciples for algorithms for sampling-based probabilistic inference in spiking neural networks, yielding potential inspiration for neuromorphic computing and testable predictions for neurobiology.",

    "abstract": "PREMISEWe investigated whether phylogenetic conservatism can improve the performance of seed germinability prediction models. Previous studies in tallgrass prairie and alpine meadow revealed that seed morphological traits demonstrate phylogenetic conservatism. We hypothesized that phylogenetic conservatism in seed traits could help predict the seed germinability, under the assumption that seed traits contain phylogenetic signals.\n\nMETHODSWe measured seed germination percentage and seed morphological traits (seed mass, seed height, and seed surface area) on 34 native species from shortgrass prairie in North America. We supplemented these data with similar data from the literature on 11 more species. We calculated the robustness of the phylogenetic signal of each trait to the number of species sampled. We also compressed the phylogenetic distance matrix to a two-dimensional space, and applied the Akaike information criterion to evaluate the effects of phylogeny on seed germinability prediction models.\n\nKEY RESULTSWe found weak but significant phylogenetic signals in seed mass and seed height in the full data set. These phylogenetic signals were not able to improve seed germinability prediction model performance among shortgrass prairie species. Our robustness tests of phylogenetic signals using random sub-sampling showed that the detection rate of phylogenetic signals in seed mass was increased along with the expansion of species pool, and nearly 100% at 40 species. However, the detection rate of phylogenetic signals in seed height was constantly low, around 20%.\n\nCONCLUSIONSWhen the phylogenetic signals are weak, the phylogenetic position does not improve germinability prediction model performance. Therefore, phylogenetic signals detected during a single species pool calculation may not accurately reflect the phylogenetic conservatism of the trait in a plant community. We suggest testing for robustness of phylogenetic signals using random sub-sampling tests.",

In this study, TD was applied to massive scATAC-seq datasets generated by approximately 200 bp intervals, and this number can reach 13,627,618. Currently, no other methods can deal with large sparse matrices.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 viruses engage ACE2 as a functional receptor with their spike protein. The S1 domain of the spike protein contains a C-terminal receptor-binding domain (RBD) and an N-terminal domain (NTD). The NTD of other coronaviruses includes a glycan-binding cleft. However, for the SARS-CoV-2 NTD protein-glycan binding was only observed weakly for sialic acids with highly sensitive methods. Amino acid changes in the NTD of Variants of Concern (VoC) shows antigenic pressure, which can be an indication of NTD-mediated receptor binding. Trimeric NTD proteins of SARS-CoV-2, Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Omicron did not reveal a receptor binding capability. Unexpectedly, the SARS-CoV-2 Beta subvariant strain (501Y.V2-1) NTD binding to Vero E6 cells was sensitive to sialidase pretreatment. Glycan microarray analyses identified a putative 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as a ligand, which was confirmed by catch-and-release ESI-MS, STD-NMR analyses, and a graphene-based electrochemical sensor. The Beta (501Y.V2-1) variant attained an enhanced glycan binding modality in the NTD with specificity towards 9-O-acetylated structures, suggesting a dual-receptor functionality of the SARS-CoV-2 S1 domain, which was quickly selected against. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can probe additional evolutionary space, allowing binding to glycan receptors on the surface of target cells.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=76 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/507904v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f98a70org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1efc119org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16e8bc6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9a74e6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG SynopsisCoronaviruses utilize their N-terminal domain (NTD) for initial reversible low-affinity interaction to (sialylated) glycans. This initial low-affinity/high-avidity engagement enables viral surfing on the target membrane, potentially followed by a stronger secondary receptor interaction. Several coronaviruses, such as HKU1 and OC43, possess a hemagglutinin-esterase for viral release after sialic acid interaction, thus allowing viral dissemination. Other coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV, do not possess a hemagglutinin-esterase, but interact reversibly to sialic acids allowing for viral surfing and dissemination. The early 501Y.V2-1 subvariant of the Beta SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern has attained a receptor-binding functionality towards 9-O-acetylated sialic acid using its NTD. This binding functionality was selected against rapidly, most likely due to poor dissemination. Ablation of sialic acid binding in more recent SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern suggests a fine balance of sialic acid interaction of SARS-CoV-2 is required for infection and/or transmission.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounting for most cases. Despite advances in cancer therapeutics, the 5-year survival rate has remained poor due to several contributing factors, including its resistance to therapeutics. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop therapeutics that can overcome resistance. Non-coding RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), have been found to contribute to cancer resistance and therapeutics by modulating the expression of several targets involving multiple key mechanisms. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic potential of miR-129 modified with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in NSCLC. Our results show that 5-FU modified miR-129 (5-FU-miR-129) inhibits proliferation, induces apoptosis, and retains function as a miRNA in NSCLC cell lines A549 and Calu-1. Notably, we observed that 5-FU-miR-129 was able to overcome resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors and chemotherapy in cell lines resistant to erlotinib or 5-FU. Furthermore, we observed that the inhibitory effect of 5-FU-miR-129 can also be achieved in NSCLC cells under vehicle-free conditions. Finally, 5-FU-miR-129 inhibited NSCLC tumor growth and extended survival in vivo without toxic side effects. Altogether, our results demonstrate the potential of 5-FU-miR-129 as a highly potent cancer therapeutic in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Many cellular processes involve the lateral organization of integral and peripheral membrane proteins into nanoscale domains. Despite the biological significance the mechanisms that facilitate membrane protein clustering into nanoscale lipid domains remain enigmatic. In cells the analysis of membrane protein phase affinity is complicated by the size and temporal nature of ordered and disordered lipid domains. To overcome these limitations we developed a method for delivering membrane proteins from transfected cells into phase-separated model membranes that combines optical trapping with thermoplasmonic-mediated membrane fusion and confocal imaging. Using this approach we observed clear phase partitioning following the transfer of GFP-tagged influenza hemagglutinin and neuraminidase from transfected cell membranes to giant unilamellar vesicles. The generic platform presented here allows investigation of the phase affinity of any plasma membrane protein which can be labeled or tagged with a fluorescent marker.",

    "abstract": "Cortical feedback (FB) projections are thought to modulate lower-order activity depending on learned expectations. However, whether FB inputs become bound to specific lower-order neurons depending on experience is unknown. We measured the effects of dark rearing and manipulations of experienced visual statistics on the retinotopic specificity of projections from the lateromedial (LM) visual area to layer 1 of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1). LM inputs were, on average, retinotopically matched with V1 neurons irrespective of visual experience. While the orientation tuning of LM axons determined the retinotopic position of the V1 neurons they innervated, this organization was absent in dark-reared mice. Restricting visual experience to a narrow range of orientations revealed that visual experience exerts an instructive role in the retinotopic organization of LM inputs in V1. Our observations support theories of hierarchical computation proposing that inputs from higher-order neurons to lower-order ones reflect learned hierarchical associations.",

    "abstract": "Glial cells account for roughly 90% of all human brain cells, and serve a variety of important developmental, structural, and metabolic functions. Recent experimental efforts suggest that astrocytes, a type of glial cell, are also directly involved in core cognitive processes such as learning and memory. While it is well-established that astrocytes and neurons are connected to one another in feedback loops across many time scales and spatial scales, there is a gap in understanding the computational role of neuron-astrocyte interactions. To help bridge this gap, we draw on recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and astrocyte imaging technology. In particular, we show that neuron-astrocyte networks can naturally perform the core computation of a Transformer, a particularly successful type of AI architecture. In doing so, we provide a concrete and experimentally testable account of neuron-astrocyte communication. Because Transformers are so successful across a wide variety of task domains, such as language, vision, and audition, our analysis may help explain the ubiquity, flexibility, and power of the brains neuron-astrocyte networks.\n\nSignificance StatementTransformers have become the default choice of neural architecture for many machine learning applications. Their success across multiple domains such as language, vision, and speech raises the question: how can one build Transformers using biological computational units? At the same time, in the glial community there is a gradually accumulating evidence that astrocytes, formerly believed to be passive house-keeping cells in the brain, in fact play important role in brains information processing and computation. In this work we hypothesize that neuron-astrocyte networks can naturally implement the core computation performed by the Transformer block in AI. The omnipresence of astrocytes in almost any brain area may explain the success of Transformers across a diverse set of information domains and computational tasks.",

    "abstract": "Biallelic mutations in Protein O-mannosyltransferase 1 (POMT1) are among the most common causes of a severe group of congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) known as dystroglycanopathies. POMT1 is a glycosyltransferase responsible for the attachment of a functional glycan mediating interactions between the transmembrane glycoprotein dystroglycan and its binding partners in the extracellular matrix (ECM). Disruptions in these cell-ECM interactions lead to multiple developmental defects causing brain and eye malformations in addition to CMD. Removing Pomt1 in the mouse leads to early embryonic death due to the essential role of dystroglycan in embryo implantation in rodents. Here, we characterized and validated a model of pomt1 loss of function in the zebrafish showing that developmental defects found in individuals affected by dystroglycanopathies can be recapitulated in the fish. We also discovered that pomt1 mRNA provided by the mother in the oocyte supports dystroglycan glycosylation during the first few weeks of development. Muscle disease, retinal synapse formation deficits, and axon guidance defects can only be uncovered during the first week post fertilization by generating knock-out embryos from knock-out mothers. Conversely, maternal pomt1 from heterozygous mothers was sufficient to sustain muscle, eye, and brain development only leading to detectable muscle disease and loss of photoreceptor synapses at 30 days post fertilization. Our findings show that it is important to define the contribution of maternal mRNA while developing zebrafish models of dystroglycanopathies and that offspring generated from heterozygous and knock-out mothers can be used to differentiate the role of dystroglycan glycosylation in tissue formation and maintenance.",

By performing cross-linking mass spectrometry (CL-MS) and integrative structural modelling we elucidate structure models of apo-{sigma}70 that exhibit burial of almost all DNA-binding residues. In vivo CL-MS detects crosslinks unique to the compact fold of apo-{sigma}70 that occur at stationary growth phase.

    "abstract": "Viruses are the most abundant biological entity in the ocean and play a significant role in shaping the marine ecosystem. The past two decades have revealed an outstanding diversity of giant viruses infecting protists across the tree of life and, in particular, algae that form massive blooms in the ocean. Virus-induced bloom demise significantly impacts marine ecology and biogeochemistry, as well as the associated microbial community. Nevertheless, little is known about the infection dynamics of these giant viruses in the natural environment and their role in regulating algal blooms. Here, we provide evidence for a daily life cycle of giant viral infection in algal blooms by processing the transcriptome of over 12,000 single algal cells during different phases of interaction with their giant viruses. We revealed that viral infection occurs already at the exponential phase of the bloom and that the timing of infection can determine the magnitude of the bloom but not the fraction of infected cells. We further revealed that the same proportion of infected cells are in the early phase of the viral replication program (13.5%) throughout several consecutive days of the bloom, suggesting that a daily turnover of infection is at play during the bloom and demise phases of the algal population. This may imply that a continuous source of virocell-associated metabolites diffuses throughout the bloom succession and could fuel the microbial food webs. Finally, we link single cell infection state to host physiology and show that infected cells remained calcified even in the late stage of infection, contradicting common observation of bulk population in which viral infection is directly linked with decalcification. Together, these results highlight the importance of studying host-virus dynamics in natural populations at a single-cell resolution, which can provide a fresh view of the dynamics and propagation of viral infection. This approach will enable quantification of the impact of marine viruses on microbial food webs.",

    "abstract": "Canine heartworm disease is a potentially deadly cardiopulmonary disease caused by the mosquito-borne filarial nematode Dirofilaria immitis. In Australia, the administration of macrocyclic lactone (ML) drugs has successfully reduced the prevalence of D. immitis infection. However, the recent re-emergence of D. immitis in dogs in Queensland, Australia and the identification of ML-resistant isolates in the USA poses an important question of whether ML-resistance has emerged in this parasite in Australia. The aim of this study was to utilise phenotypic and genotypic approaches to examine the sensitivity to ML drugs in D. immitis in Australia. To do this, we surveyed 45 dogs from Queensland and New South Wales across 3 years (2019-2022) for the presence of D. immitis infection using an antigen test, quantitative Modified Knotts test, and qPCR targeting both D. immitis and the D. immitis symbiont Wolbachia. A phenotype observed by utilising sequential quantification of microfilariae for 23/45 dogs was coupled with genetic testing of filtered microfilariae for SNPs previously associated with ML-resistance in isolates from the USA. Sixteen (16/45) dogs tested positive for D. immitis infection despite reportedly receiving  rigorous heartworm prevention for 12 months prior to the study, according to the owners assessment. The phenotype and genotypic assays in this study did not unequivocally demonstrate the presence of ML-resistant D. immitis in Australia. Although the failure of 16 dogs to reduce microfilaremia by >90% after ML treatment was considered a suspect phenotype of ML-resistance, no genotypic evidence was discovered using the genetic SNP analysis. The traditional quantitative Modified Knotts test can be substituted by qPCR targeting D. immitis or associated Wolbachia endosymbiont DNA for a more rapid measurement of microfilariae levels. More definitive phenotypic evidence of resistance is critically needed before the usefulness of SNPs for the detection of ML-resistance in Australia can be properly assessed.",

Because ionic currents of protons or sodium drive the rotation of bacterial flagella, it is possible that the motion of motile bacterial species will be affected if they swim through a strong magnetic field. We tested this prediction in mixed cultures of soil bacteria and observed that a magnetic field does in fact exert a filtering effect that alters the composition of the mixed population of motile species. We then monitored motility and growth to see if magnetic fields affected individual bacterial species (Vibrio, Enterobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp.) The same magnetic field had no observable effect on motility or growth. Although magnetic fields may have served as a selective factor in the evolution of certain species such as magnetotactic motile bacteria, they do not appear to have a direct effect on the ionic current driving flagellar rotation.",

We evaluated the impact of one such abiotic stress, elevated tropospheric ozone (O3), under open-top chamber field conditions on host susceptibility and phyllosphere microbiome associated with pepper cultivars resistant and susceptible to Xanthomonas. Pathogen challenge resulted in distinct microbial community structures in both cultivars under an ambient environment. Elevated O3 alone affected microbial community structure associated with resistant cultivar but not the susceptible cultivar, indicating the role of host genotypic background in response to abiotic stress. Elevated O3 did not influence overall host susceptibility but did increase disease severity on the resistant cultivar, indicating a possible compromise in the resistance. Interestingly, combined stress resulted in a shift in microbial composition and structure like that observed with pathogen challenge alone. It indicates the possible prioritization of community response towards the most significant stress and pathogen being most influential regardless of the cultivar. Despite community composition differences, overall functional redundancy was observed in the phyllosphere community. To gain insights into community-level interactions, network topology assessment indicated a stable network with enhanced taxon connectedness upon pathogen challenge. However, an observation of destabilized random network with a shift in hub taxa in the presence of combined stress warrants future studies on the consequences of such unstable microbial communities on host response to pathogens in the face of climate change.",

To understand the broader picture of hybridization within the annual sunflowers, we used whole genome resequencing to conduct a phylogenomic analysis and test for gene flow between lineages. We find that all annual sunflower species tested have evidence of admixture, suggesting hybridization was common during the radiation of the genus. Support for the major species tree decreases with recombination rate, consistent with hybridization and introgression contributing to discordant topologies. Admixture graphs found hybridization to be associated with the origins of the three putative hybrid species (H. anomalus, H. deserticola, and H. paradoxus). However, the hybridization events are more ancient than suggested by previous work. Furthermore, H. anomalus and H. deserticola appear to have arisen from a single hybridization event involving an unexpected donor, rather than through multiple independent events as previously proposed. Using a broader data set that covers the whole Helianthus genus, including perennial species, we find that signals of introgression span the genus and beyond, suggesting highly divergent introgression and/or the sorting of ancient haplotypes. Thus, Helianthus can be viewed as a syngameon in which largely reproductively isolated species are linked together by occasional or frequent gene flow.",

    "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic disease caused by mutations that compromise the expression and/ or function of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel (CFTR). Most people with CF harbor a common misfolded CFTR variant ({Delta}F508), which can be rescued by combination therapies containing \"corrector\" compounds that restore its expression. Nevertheless, there are over 400 other CF variants that differ in their sensitivity to correctors for reasons that remain unclear. In this work, we utilize deep mutational scanning to quantitatively compare the effects of two FDA-approved correctors on the plasma membrane expression of 129 known CF variants, including 45 that are currently unclassified. Across 67 variants with attenuated expression, we find that VX-661-sensitive variants generally exhibit intermediate expression and feature mutations near its binding pocket in transmembrane domains (TMDs) 1, 2, 3, and 6. VX-445 also primarily rescues variants with intermediate expression but is instead uniquely effective towards mutations near its binding pocket in TMDs 10 & 11. Structural calculations suggest corrector binding provides similar stabilization to both sensitive and insensitive variants. These findings collectively suggest the mutation-specific effects of these compounds depend on the degree of variant destabilization and/ or the timing of cotranslational folding defects. Combining these correctors synergistically rescues variants with deficient and intermediate expression alike, presumably by doubling the total binding energy and suppressing defects at different stages of translation. These results provide an unprecedented overview of the properties of rare CFTR variants and establish new tools for CF pharmacology.",

    "abstract": "The often-forgotten astrocytes play an important role in the central nervous system, contributing to the development of and maintenance of synapses, recycling of neurotransmitters, and the pathophysiology of various neurodegenerative diseases. Hydrogels can provide improved support and attachment for the culture of astrocytes in 3D models, which could further be used to advance clinical in vivo like tissue models of numerous diseases. For full applicability, these gels must be of scalable and defined origin and with stable attachment elements, such as peptides. In this study, the generation of a functional 3D astrocyte model is presented using a hyaluronan-based hydrogel system conjugated with the peptide sequences cyclic RGD (cRGD) and IKVAV, known promoters of cell attachment. Encapsulation of the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and glioblastoma cell line U87 is successfully demonstrated over a 6-day culture period. The presence of the peptides cRGD and IKVAV does not change the cells viability. Human fetal primary astrocytes (FPA) are further tested for the 3D culture in these materials, similarly, showing that the peptides have no effect on the viability over a 6-day culture period. mRNA expression analysis reveals no biologically significant changes in the 3D cultures FPA or the U87 cells. Morphological analysis, on the other hand, revealed that FPA have a higher degree of interactions with the hyaluronan-based gels compared to the cell lines. This interaction is enhanced by peptide conjugation, in particular cRGD. Finally, we demonstrated that the peptide conjugated hydrogels could be used for bioprinting of FPA, opening up for defined neural astrocytic co-culture.",

    "abstract": "Constitutive activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) via different mutation has a strong impact into development of severe human disorders, including cancer. While pathological effect of such mutations can be common on the phenotypical level, mechanistic understanding of their contribution into the receptor activation depends on the exact molecular context. Mutations in transmembrane (TM) domains represent an interesting class of pathological modifications since they can directly affect a signal transduction pathway from the receptor to the kinase domains of RTKs. Here we propose a putative activation scenario of RTK, whereby TM mutations can also promote higher order oligomerization of the receptors that leads to the subsequent ligand-free activation. To illustrate this model with all-atom resolution for a previously characterized oncogenic TM mutation V536E in platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), we use a computational modeling framework including sequence-based structure prediction and all-atom 1 {micro}s molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a model membrane for the predicted configuration of the PDGFRA TM tetramers. We show that in the course of MD simulations the mutant tetramer retains stable and compact configuration, which is strengthened by tight protein-protein interactions. In contrast, the wild type tetramer demonstrates looser packing and tendency to dissociate. Such a structural organization shapes the dynamics of TM helices in the oligomeric state. Specifically, the mutation affects the characteristic motions of mutated TM helical segments by introducing additional non-covalent crosslinks in the middle of the TM tetramer, which work as mechanical hinges. This leads to dynamic decoupling of the C-termini from the rigidified N-terminal parts and facilitates higher possible displacement between the C-termini of the mutant TM helical regions. This, in turn, can provide more freedom to downstream kinase domains in their mutual rearrangement. The observed structural and dynamic effects of the V536E mutations in the context of PDGFRA TM tetramer provide an interesting possibility that an effect of oncogenic TM mutations can go beyond alternating structure and dynamics of TM dimeric states and also promote formation of higher-order oligomers that may directly contribute into the ligand independent signaling of PDGFRA and other RTKs.",
