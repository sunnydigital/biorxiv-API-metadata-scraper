    "abstract": "From sowing in late summer until harvest in following summer, oilseed rape can be infected by several fungi, which foliar symptoms (leaf spots) coexist on the crop. Training an expert at their identification is quick for the typical symptoms with characteristic appearance. However, in many cases the size, colour and morphology are similar and for the atypical symptoms, there is a risk of confusion or in-decidability. Also, scouting the fields for expert training is not possible at all seasons and all diseases might not be seen in all years and all places. The aim of our study was to produce large sets of pictures annotated by several experts, from which tables illustrating the diversity of symptom appearance were chosen. These tables will enable assistance to diagnostic and expert training.",

    "abstract": "Myco-talpology is the science of mushrooms and talpid moles based on our discovery in 1976 that underground mole nests can be located by the aboveground fruiting of the agarics Hebeloma danicum or Hebeloma sagarae, a Japanese sibling species of European Hebeloma radicosum. Hyphae of these mushrooms specifically colonise mole latrines near nests, forming ectomycorrhizas with the roots of their host trees. By this process, the hyphae and roots absorb, transform, and translocate the nutrients from mole excretions, cleaning the moles habitat. The mushrooms fruit on the ground with thick root-like tissue stretching up from the ectomycorrhizas. The presence of the fruit bodies serves as the only indicator for underground mole nests, enabling us to provide novel insights into mole ecology. We excavated 74 H. sagarae or H. danicum sites in Japan and 13 H. radicosum sites in Europe and identified the nesting species. These investigations provided new perspectives on latrine making, nest structure, breeding and nestlings, the neighbouring presence of different Talpini species, and long-term nesting at the same site with inhabitant changes. Moreover, they suggested that a tripartite habitat-cleaning symbiosis among moles, mushrooms, and mushroom-host trees in the latrine must have existed for a long time in Japanese and European forests. While moles are traditionally considered inhabitants of open areas, their special relationship with mushrooms and trees suggests they may originally be forest inhabitants.",

    "abstract": "Living in nests is an almost universal feature of eusocial animals. In some aphids, however, sterile soldier castes have evolved in open colonies without a nest. To clarify the factors promoting the evolution of eusociality in these colonies, we used newly developed microsatellite markers to compare the kin structure of the open colonies of two aphid species on bamboo: the non-eusocial colonies of Astegopteryx bambucifoliae and the eusocial colonies of Pseudoregma alexanderi on Dendrocalamus latiflorus.\n\nOur samples, from over 1,000 hectares, contained 99 clones of A. bambucifoliae and 19 of P. alexanderi. Clonal mixing occurred in both species: average pairwise relatedness within a colony was 0.54 in A. bambucifoliae and 0.71 in P. alexanderi. Each clone of A. bambucifoliae occurred in a unique location, whereas those of P. alexanderi occurred in multiple locations and more than 90% of individuals came from just four clones. There was significant genetic variation among different colonies in the same clump (stem-cluster) in A. bambucifoliae but not in P. alexanderi, indicating that P. alexanderi colonies in a single clump are genetically homogenized, functioning as a large colony. In P. alexanderi, the proportion of sterile soldiers to normal first-instar nymphs was significantly different across the four clones.\n\nOur results indicate that the lack of input of migrants from the primary host and feeding on a large, stable host plant are important ecological factors that might favour the evolution of eusociality, enabling the production of genetically homogenised, large, and long-lived colonies. After eusociality evolves on the secondary host, the optimal strategy of soldier production might vary between different clones.\n\nSignificance StatementNest-living has often been considered to be a necessary condition for the evolution of eusociality. In a small number of aphid species, however, sterile soldier castes have evolved in open colonies without a nest. To understand why these aphids are unique, we examined the kin structure and genetic relatedness of individuals within eusocial and non-eusocial open colonies of two aphid species on bamboo. We found that clonal mixing occurred in both species, but the eusocial colonies are more genetically homogenized, functioning as a large colony. Our results suggest that ecological conditions that promote genetically homogenized, large and long-lived colonies are important for the evolution of eusociality in these aphids. We propose that the open colonies of social aphids provide an ideal model system in which to study the evolution of altruism.",

    "abstract": "Although asexual linages evolved from sexual lineages in many different taxa, the genetics of sex loss remains poorly understood. We addressed this issue in the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, whose natural populations encompass lineages performing cyclical parthenogenesis (CP) and producing one sexual generation per year, as well as obligate parthenogenetic (OP) lineages that can no longer produce sexual females but can still produce males. A SNP-based, whole-genome scan of CP and OP populations sequenced in pools (103 individuals from six populations) showed that a single X-linked region controls the variation in reproductive mode. This 840-kb region is highly divergent between CP and OP populations (FST = 34.9%), with >2000 SNPs or short Indels showing a high degree of association with the phenotypic trait. Comparison of de novo genome assemblies built from long reads did not reveal large structural rearrangements between CP and OP lineages within the candidate region. This reproductive polymorphism still appears relatively ancient, as we estimated its age at ~0.25 million years from the divergence between cp and op alleles. The low genetic differentiation between CP and OP populations at the rest of the genome (FST = 2.4%) suggests gene flow between them. Males from OP lineages thus likely transmit their op allele to new genomic backgrounds. This \"contagious asexuality\", combined with environment-induced selection (each reproductive mode being favored under different climates) probably contributes to the long-term persistence of the cp and op alleles.\n\nSignificanceAsexual taxa occur in all major clades of Eukaryotes and derive from related sexual species. Yet, the genetic basis for these transitions is poorly known because crosses cannot generally be performed to genetically map the ability to propagate asexually. As a result, only one gene responsible for sex loss has been identified in one animal species. Here, using pooled genome sequencing, we identified an 840kb region (carrying 32 genes) that controls the transition to permanent asexuality in the pea aphid. We also revealed that sexual and asexual alleles diverged 0.25 million years ago and that asexual lineages likely persist through contagious asexuality, providing new insights into the mechanisms of coexistence of sexual and asexual lineages.",

We generated and analyzed whole-genome sequence data for nearly all individuals living in early 2018 (169 individuals) to generate a high-quality species-wide genetic variant callset. We leverage extensive long-term metadata to quantify genome-wide diversity of the species over time and present new approaches using probabilistic programming, combined with a phenotype dataset spanning five decades, to disentangle phenotypic variance into environmental and genetic effects while quantifying uncertainty in small populations. We find associations for growth, disease susceptibility, clutch size, and egg fertility within genic regions previously shown to influence these traits in other species. Finally, we generate breeding values to predict phenotype and illustrate that active management over the past 45 years has maintained both genome-wide diversity and diversity in breeding values, and hence, evolutionary potential.

Aspiration can help retrieval of the main clot but fails to prevent secondary embolism in the distal arterial territory. The dense meshes of extracellular DNA, recently described in stroke-related clots, might serve as an anchoring platform for MT devices.\n\nObjectiveEvaluate the potential of DNA reacting surface to aid the retention of the main clot as well as of its small fragments within the thrombectomy device and improve the potential of MT procedures.\n\nMethodsDevice-suitable alloy experimental samples were coated with 15 different compounds and contacted with extracellular DNA or with human peripheral whole blood, to compare their binding to DNA versus flowing blood elements, in vitro. Clinical-grade MT devices were coated with two selected compounds and evaluated in functional bench tests aiming to studying clot retrieval and distal emboli release, concomitant with contact aspiration, using an M1 occlusion model.\n\nResultsBinding properties of samples coated with all compounds were increased for DNA ({approx} 3-fold) and decreased ({approx} 5-fold) for blood elements, essentially platelet, as compared to the bare alloy samples, in vitro. Functional testing showed that surface modification with DNA-binding compounds improved clot retrieval and significantly reduced secondary embolism during experimental recanalization of occluded artery 3D model by thrombectomy procedures.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that device coating with DNA-binding compounds can considerably improve the outcome of MT procedures in stroke patients.\n\nWhat is already known on this topic - New mechanical thrombectomy device are being improved on the conformation and shape to increase the interaction clot on the physical point of view. However, none interact specifically with the structure or composition of the clot.\n\nWhat this study adds - The design of a chemical surface modification of the device opens the way for a specific targeting tool to increase the interaction with the clot on the molecular level.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policy - This new surface modification, which can be applied to all commercially available mechanical thrombectomy devices, leads to a decrease in secondary embolization which cannot and is not monitored during the procedure and responsible for new territory damage.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMutation-induced drug resistance - where the efficacy of drugs is diminished by structural changes in proteins - presents a significant challenge to drug development and the clinical treatment of disease. Understanding the effects of mutation on protein-ligand binding affinities is a key step in developing more effective drugs and therapies, but as a research community we are currently hindered by the lack of a comprehensive database of relevant information. To address this issue, we have developed MdrDB, a database of information related to changes in protein-ligand affinity caused by mutations in protein structure. MdrDB combines data from seven publicly available datasets with calculated biochemical features, as well as 3D structures computed with PyMOL and AlphaFold 2.0, to form the largest database of its kind. With 3D structural information provided for all samples, MdrDB was specifically created to have the size, breadth, and complexity to be useful for practical protein mutation studies and drug resistance modeling. The database brings together wild type and mutant protein-ligand complexes, binding affinity changes upon mutation ({Delta}{Delta}G), and biochemical features calculated from complexes to advance our understanding of mutation-induced drug resistance, the development of combination therapies, and the discovery of novel chemicals. In total, MdrDB contains 100,537 samples generated from 240 proteins (5,119 total PDB structures), 2,503 mutations, and 440 drugs. Of the total samples, 95,971 are based on available PDB structures, with the remaining 4,566 based on AlphaFold 2.0 predicted structures.",

    "abstract": "The ever-increasing availability of single-cell transcriptomic data offers unrivaled opportunities to profile cellular states in various biological processes at high resolution, which has brought substantial advancements in understanding complex mechanisms underlying a large variety of bioprocesses. As limited by the protocol and technology, single-cell measurements in one study are often performed in batches, which unavoidably induces biological and technical differences in the single-cell measurements of the same study. Consequently, it presents challenges in analyzing all single-cell data from different batches together, particularly if the measurements were assayed with different technologies. Several methods have been developed to remove the aforementioned batch effects recently. However, there remain challenges unaddressed with those existing methods, including but not limited to the risk of over-correction, the need for the assumption of gene expression distribution, and expensive computation. To mitigate those limitations, we develop a novel deep learning method called scCobra that combines contrastive learning, domain adaptation, and generative adversarial networks to remove batch effects in single-cell RNA-seq data. The contrastive learning network is utilized to learn latent embeddings to represent the cells, domain-adaptation is employed to batch-normalize the latent embeddings of cells from distinct batches, while generative adversarial networks further optimize the blending effect. The proposed method does not require any prior assumption of gene expression distribution. We applied the scCobra method to one simulated and two real single-cell datasets with significantly experimental differences. Our method outperforms other benchmarked methods in batch correction and biological conservation, and its running efficiency is also among the best.",

The spatial activation of these pathways ultimately leads to some sort of symmetry breaking around the cell periphery in the form of redistribution of several biochemicals, e.g., polymerized actin at one side of the cell for propulsion and the assembly of myosin II at nearly opposite side for retraction. In this study, we revisit the modeling of this process, which is called directional sensing, with a compartment-based design. In our model, we consider a network of excitable elements around cell circumference which are stimulated occasionally with local colored noise. The exciting elements are capable of sharing information with their close neighbors. We show that the dynamic can distinguish a temporary but enough long-lasting direction, statistically, pointing towards the gradient of external stimulants that can be deemed as the preferred orientation of the cell periphery during the directional sensing process in eukaryotes.",

Given the elevated ATP levels seen in PDAC, the purinergic axis represents an attractive therapeutic target.

We have analysed the PDAC purinome using publicly available databases to discern which members may impact patient survival. We identified P2RY2 to be the purinergic gene with the strongest association to hypoxia, the highest cancer cell specific expression and the strongest impact on overall survival. Invasion assays using a 3D spheroid model revealed P2Y2 to be critical in facilitating invasion driven by extracellular ATP. Using genetic modification or pharmacological strategies we identify the mechanism of this ATP-driven invasion to require direct protein-protein interactions between P2Y2 and V integrins. Using DNA-PAINT super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, we found that P2Y2 regulates the amount and distribution of integrin V in the plasma membrane. This work highlights a novel GPCR-integrin interaction in cancer invasion and its potential for therapeutic targeting.",

Here, we revealed for the first time that the sEV biogenesis and release into the microenvironment are tightly connected with another important organelle: Lipid Droplets (LD). We have observed this correlation using different human cancer cell lines as well as patient-derived colorectal cancer stem cells (CR-CSCs). Our results showed that the use of external stimuli such as radiation, pH, hypoxia, or lipid interfering drugs, known to affect the LD content, had a similar effect in terms of sEV secretion. Additional validations were brought using multiple omics data, at the mRNA and protein levels. Altogether, the possibility to fine-tune sEV biogenesis by targeting LDs, could have a massive impact on the amount, the cargos and the properties of those sEVs, paving the way for new clinical perspectives.\n\nSignificance Statement",

Here we evaluated the effects of habitual early life consumption of either SSB or LCS on energy balance later during adulthood. Male and female rats were provided with chow, water, and a solution containing either SSB (sucrose), LCS [acesulfame potassium (ACE-K) or stevia], or control (no solution) during the juvenile and adolescent periods (postnatal days 26-70). SSB or LCS consumption was voluntary and restricted within federal recommended daily limits. When subsequently maintained on a cafeteria-style junk food diet (CAF; various high-fat, high-sugar foods) during adulthood, ACE-K-exposed rats demonstrated reduced caloric consumption vs. controls, which contributed to lower body weights in female but not male ACE-K rats. These discrepant intake and body weight effects in male ACE-K rats are likely based on reduced gene expression of thermogenic indicators (UCP1, BMP8B) in brown adipose tissue. Female stevia-exposed rats did not differ from controls in caloric intake or body weight, yet they consumed more SSB during adult CAF exposure. No SSB-exposed rats, neither male nor female, differed from controls in adult total caloric consumption or body weight measures. Collective results reveal that early life LCS consumption alters sugar preference, body weight, and gene expression for markers of thermogenesis during adulthood, with both sex- and sweetener-dependent effects.",

    "abstract": "Dissecting plant responses to the environment is key to understanding if and how plants adapt to anthropogenic climate change. Stomata, plants pores for gas exchange, are expected to decrease in density following increased CO2 concentrations, a trend already observed in multiple plant species. However, it is unclear if such responses are based on genetic changes and evolutionary adaptation. Here we make use of extensive knowledge of 43 genes in the stomatal development pathway and newly generated genome information of 191 A. thaliana historical herbarium specimens collected over the last 193 years to directly link genetic variation with climate change. While we find that the essential transcription factors SPCH, MUTE and FAMA, central to stomatal development, are under strong evolutionary constraints, several regulators of stomatal development show signs of local adaptation in contemporary samples from different geographic regions. We then develop a polygenic score based on known effects of gene knock-out on stomatal development that recovers a classic pattern of stomatal density decrease over the last centuries without requiring direct phenotype observation of historical samples. This approach combining historical genomics with functional experimental knowledge could allow further investigations of how different, even in historical samples unmeasurable, cellular plant phenotypes have already responded to climate change through adaptive evolution.\n\nOne sentence summaryUsing a molecular-knowledge based genetic phenotype proxy, historical whole-genome A. thaliana timelines compared with contemporary data indicate a shift of stomatal density following climate-associated predictions.",

    "abstract": "Research experiences provide diverse benefits for undergraduates. Many academic institutions have adopted course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs) to improve student access to research opportunities. However, potential instructors of a CURE might still face financial or practical hurdles that prevent implementation. Bioinformatics research offers an alternative that is free, safe, compatible with remote learning, and may be more accessible for students with disabilities. Here, we describe a bioinformatics CURE that leverages publicly available datasets to discover novel proteins that target an instructor-determined genomic locus of interest. We use the free, user-friendly bioinformatics platform Galaxy to map ChIP-seq datasets to a genome, which removes the computing burden from students. Both faculty and students directly benefit from this CURE, as faculty can perform candidate screens and publish CURE results. Students gain not only basic bioinformatics knowledge, but also transferable skills, including scientific communication, database navigation, and primary literature experience. The CURE is flexible and can be expanded to analyze different types of high-throughput data or to investigate different genomic loci in any species.",

    "abstract": "Due to insufficient insulin secretion, patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) are prone to blood glucose fluctuations ranging from hypoglycemia to hyperglycemia. While dangerous hypoglycemia may lead to coma immediately, chronic hyperglycemia increases patients risks for cardiorenal and vascular diseases in the long run. In principle, an artificial pancreas - a closed-loop insulin delivery system requiring patients manually input insulin dosage according to the upcoming meals - could supply exogenous insulin to control the glucose levels and hence reduce the risks from hyperglycemia. However, insulin overdosing in some type 1 diabetic patients, who are physically active, can lead to unexpected hypoglycemia beyond the control of common artificial pancreas. Therefore, it is important to take into account the glucose decrease due to physical exercise when designing the next-generation artificial pancreas. In this work, we develop a deep reinforcement learning algorithm using a T1DM dataset, containing data from wearable devices, to automate insulin dosing for patients with T1DM. In particular, we build patient-specific computational models using systems biology informed neural networks (SBINN), to mimic the glucose-insulin dynamics for a few patients from the dataset, by simultaneously considering patient-specific carbohydrate intake and physical exercise intensity.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic dysfunction, weakening, and loss of synapses are well-correlated with the pathology of Alzheimers disease (AD). Oligomeric amyloid beta (oA{beta}) is considered a major synaptotoxic trigger for AD. Recent studies have implicated hyperactivation of the complement cascade as the driving force for loss of synapses caused by oA{beta}. However, the initial synaptic cues that trigger pathological complement activity remain elusive. Here, we examined a form of synaptic long-term depression (LTD) mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) which is disrupted in rodent models of AD. Exogenous application of oA{beta} (1-42) to mouse hippocampal slices enhanced the magnitude of mGlu subtype 5 receptor (mGlu5R)-dependent LTD. We found that the enhanced synaptic weakening occurred via both NMDARs and complement C3aR/C5aR signaling. Our findings reveal a mechanistic interaction between mGlu5R, NMDARs, and the complement cascade in synaptic weakening induced by oA{beta}, which could represent an early trigger of synaptic loss and degeneration in AD.",

Despite the mutations being in IN, the virus release was significantly suppressed (p < 0.0001) and the initiation of autoprocessing was inhibited; the mechanism of the defect remains unknown. In the current study, we attempted to identify the critical domains or amino acid (aa) residue(s) that promote defects in HIV(IN:M50I/V151I), using a series of variants, including truncated or aa-substituted RNase H (RH) or IN. The results demonstrated that virus release and the initiation of autoprocessing were regulated by the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of RH and IN. Further studies illustrated that Asp at codon 109 of RH CTD and Asp at the C terminus of IN induces the defect. This result indicated that the CTD of RH and IN in GagPol and particular aa positions in RH and IN regulated the virus release and the initiation of autoprocessing, and these sites could be potential targets for the developing new therapies.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesAn increasing number of isolations of Corynebacterium diphtheriae has been observed in recent years in the archipelago of New Caledonia. We aimed to analyze the clinical and microbiological features of samples with C. diphtheriae.\n\nMethodsAll C. diphtheriae isolates identified in New Caledonia from May 2015 to May 2019 were included. For each case, a retrospective consultation of the patient files was conducted. Antimicrobial susceptibility phenotypes, tox gene and diphtheria toxin expression, biovar and the genomic sequence were determined. Core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), 7-gene MLST and search of genes of interest were performed from genomic assemblies.\n\nResults58 isolates were included, with a median age of patients of 28 years (range: 9 days to 78 years). Cutaneous origin accounted for 51 of 58 (87.9%) isolates, and C. diphtheriae was associated with Staphylococcus aureus and/or Streptococcus pyogenes in three quarters of cases. Half of cases came either from the main city Noumea (24%, 14/58) or from the sparsely populated island of Lifou (26%, 15/58). Six tox-positive isolates were identified, associated with recent travel to Vanuatu; 5 of these cases were linked and cgMLST confirmed recent transmission. Two cases of endocarditis in young female patients with a history of rheumatic fever involved tox-negative isolates. The 58 isolates were mostly susceptible to commonly used antibiotics. In particular, no isolate was resistant to the first-line molecules amoxicillin or erythromycin. Resistance to tetracycline was found in a genomic cluster of 17 (29%) isolates, 16 of which carried the tetO gene. There were 13 cgMLST sublineages, most of which were also observed in the neighboring country Australia.\n\nConclusionsCutaneous infections may harbor non-toxigenic C. diphtheriae isolates, which circulate largely silently in non-specific wounds. The possible introduction of tox-positive strains from a neighboring island illustrates that diphtheria surveillance should be maintained in New Caledonia, and that immunization in neighboring islands must be improved. Genomic sequencing uncovers how genotypes circulate locally and across neighboring countries.",

    "abstract": "PLK1 is an important regulator of mitosis whose protein levels and activity fluctuate during the cell cycle. PLK1 dynamically localizes to various mitotic structures to regulate chromosome segregation. However, the signaling pathways linking localized PLK1 activity to its protein stability remain elusive. Here, we identify the Ubiquitin-Binding Protein 2-Like (UBAP2L) that controls both, the localization and the protein stability of PLK1.We demonstrate that UBAP2L is a spindle-associated protein whose depletion leads to severe mitotic defects. UBAP2L depleted cells are characterized by increased PLK1 protein levels and abnormal PLK1 accumulation in several mitotic structures such as kinetochores, centrosomes and mitotic spindle. UBAP2L deficient cells exit mitosis and enter the next interphase in the presence of aberrant PLK1 kinase activity. The C-terminal domain of UBAP2L mediates its function on PLK1 independently of its role in stress response signaling. Importantly, the mitotic defects of UBAP2L depleted cells are largely rescued upon chemical inhibition of PLK1. Overall, our data suggest that UBAP2L is required to finetune the ubiquitin-mediated PLK1 turnover during mitosis as a means to maintain genome fidelity.",

This study aims to establish the frequency and pattern of chromosomal abnormalities (CA) in both primary amenorrhea (PA) and secondary amenorrhea (SA), and further to detect the genetic changes in exon 10 at nucleotide positions 919 and 2039 of the genotypes Thr307Ala, and Asn680Ser, respectively.\n\nMethodThis cross-sectional study was conducted on a sample of seventy amenorrhoeic women according to the Helsinki declaration rules of medical ethics, as divided into 40 (57.14%) with PA and 30 (42.86%) with SA, and 30 healthy women with normal menstruation as the control. The chromosomal karyotyping was performed according to the ISCN, 2020. PCR products were submitted to RFLP and Sanger sequencing for women with normal karyotype and high FSH serum levels.\n\nResultThe classical Turner Syndrome was the most common CA in PA, followed by isochromosome X [46, Xi(X)(q10)], mosaicism of Turner and isochromosome X [45, X /46, Xi(X)(q10)], sex reversal (46, XY) and (46, XX,-3,+der3,-19,del 19 p). Abnormal SA cases were characterized by mosaicism Turner syndrome (45,X/46,XX) and (46,XX,-3,+der3,X,+derX). The homozygous genotypes AA and GG of Ala307Thr (rs6165) in the FSHR gene are most common in PA, while the homozygous genotype AA is more common in SA. GG and AG genotypes of Ser680Asn (rs6166) are more frequent in Iraqi patients with PA and SA compared to the healthy control women. Both PCR-RFLP and Sanger sequencing indicated a marked matching between genotypes.\n\nConclusionsThe study emphasizes the need for cytogenetic analysis to determine the genetic basis of PA and SA. Further, genotyping for women with normal karyotype and high FSH serum concentrations via PCR-RFLP should be considered for the precise diagnosis and development of appropriate management of and counselling for these patients.",

By phylogenetic analysis, we classified the wheat BURP genes into five subfamilies: BURP VI, BURP VII, RD22-like, PG1{beta}-like, and the newly defined BURP VIII. BURP genes were distributed unevenly on 20 chromosomes, and 33 (61%) were anchored in the distal chromosome segments. Analysis of gene duplication events showed that segmental duplication was the main contributor to the expansion of this gene family in wheat. Assessment of tissue-specific and stress-induced expression indicated that most BURP members are heavily involved in plant development and responses to various stress conditions. RNA-seq data revealed ten TaBURP genes expressed specifically in spikes.",

While PB is known to fold during in vitro simulations in three microseconds, all three initially unfolded PB copies in our cytoplasm model never completely reached their native topology across our 31 microsecond simulation. We were able to capture initial formation of all three helices and a compact topology similar to the native state. Sticking interactions between PB and surrounding macromolecules, as well as other unfolded PBs, became competitive with PB folding. Interaction between PB copies seeded beta-strand formation, modeling initial events of protein aggregation. Finally, the fold-switching potential of PB related GA domains has been explored in previous studies, and the sticking and crowding in our model thus initiates sampling of helix/sheet structural plasticity of PB.",

    "abstract": "Characteristic spatial differences of cellular resting potential across tissues have been shown to act as instructive bioelectric prepatterns regulating embryonic and regenerative morphogenesis, as well as cancer suppression. Indeed, modulation of bioelectric patterns via specific ion channel-targeting drugs, channel misexpression, or optogenetics has been used to control growth and form in vitro, showing promise in regenerative medicine and synthetic bioengineering. Repair of defects, injury, and transformation requires quantitative understanding of bioelectric dynamics within tissues so that these can be modulated toward desired outcomes in organ patterning or the creation of entirely novel synthetic constructs. The major gap in the discovery of interventions for rational control of organ-level outcomes is the inability to predict large-scale bioelectric patterns - their emergence from symmetry breaking (given a set of channels expressed on the tissue) and their change as a function of time under specific bioelectrical interventions. It is thus essential to develop machine learning and other computational tools to help human scientists identify bioelectric states with desirable properties. Here, we tested the ability of a heuristic search algorithm to explore the parameter space of bio-electrical circuits by adjusting the parameters of simulated cells. We show that while bioelectrical space is not easy to search, it does contain parameter sets that encode rich and interesting patterning behaviors. We demonstrate proof of principle of using a computational search platform to identify circuits with desired properties, as a first step toward the design of machine learning tools for improved bioelectric control of growth and form.",

Understanding the physico-chemical properties of bacteria and spores is therefore essential in developing antiadhesive surfaces and disinfection techniques. However, measuring physico-chemical properties in bulk does not show the heterogeneity between cells. Characterizing bacteria on a single-cell level can provide mechanistic clues usually hidden in bulk measurements.

    "abstract": "It has been recognized that the efficacy of TMS-based modulation may depend on the network profile of the stimulated regions throughout the brain. However, what profile of this stimulation network optimally benefits treatment outcomes is yet to be addressed. The answer to the question is crucial for informing network-based optimization of stimulation parameters, such as coil placement, in TMS treatments. In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of taking a disease-specific network as the target of stimulation network for guiding individualized coil placement in TMS treatments. We present here a novel network-based model for TMS targeting of the pathological network. First, combining E-field modeling and resting-state functional connectivity, stimulation networks were modeled from locations and orientations of the TMS coil. Second, the spatial anti-correlation between the stimulation network and the pathological network of a given disease was hypothesized to predict the treatment outcome. The proposed model was validated to predict treatment efficacy from the position and orientation of TMS coils in two depression cohorts and one auditory verbal hallucinations cohort. We further demonstrate the utility of the proposed model in guiding individualized TMS treatment for psychiatric disorders. In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrated the feasibility of the novel network-based targeting strategy that uses the whole-brain, system-level abnormity of a specific psychiatric disease as a target. Results based on empirical data suggest that the strategy may potentially be utilized to identify individualized coil parameters for maximal therapeutic effects.\n\nHighlightsO_LIProposed a model of targeting pathological brain networks for pre-treatment TMS coil placement planning in the treatment of psychiatric disorders;\nC_LIO_LIValidated the network targeting model in three cohorts of patients with depression or auditory verbal hallucinations, via prediction of individual TMS treatment efficacy from the parameters of coil placement;\nC_LIO_LIDemonstrated the utility of the network targeting model in guiding individualized TMS coil placement.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesTo better understand the pathogenesis of pericardial tuberculosis (PCTB), we sought to characterize the systemic inflammatory profile in HIV-1-infected participants with latent TB infection (LTBI), pulmonary TB (PTB) and PCTB.\n\nMethodsUsing Luminex, we measured 39 analytes in pericardial fluid (PCF) and paired plasma from 18 PCTB participants, and plasma from 16 LTBI and 20 PTB. Follow-up plasma samples were also obtained from PTB and PCTB participants. HLA-DR expression on Mtb-specific CD4 T cells was measured in baseline samples using flow cytometry.\n\nResultsAssessment of the overall systemic inflammatory profile by principal component analysis showed that the inflammatory profile of active TB participants was distinct from the LTBI group, while PTB patients could not be distinguished from those with PCTB. In the LTBI group, 12 analytes showed a positive association with plasma HIV-1 viral load, and most of these associations were lost in the diseased groups. When comparing the inflammatory profile between PCF and paired blood, we found that the concentrations of most analytes (24/39) were elevated at site of disease. However, the inflammatory profile in PCF partially mirrored inflammatory events in the blood. After TB treatment completion, the overall plasma inflammatory profile reverted to those observed in the LTBI group. Lastly, HLA-DR expression showed the best performance for TB diagnosis compared to previously described biosignatures built from soluble markers.\n\nConclusionOur results describe the inflammatory profile associated with PTB and PCTB and emphasize the potential role of HLA-DR as a promising biomarker for TB diagnosis.",

    "abstract": "Type IV pilus (TFP) is a multifunctional bacterial structure involved in twitching motility, adhesion, biofilm formation, as well as natural competence. Here, by mutagenesis and functional analysis, we dissected the roles of all genes required for TFP biosynthesis and regulation in the reemergent plant pathogenic fastidious prokaryote Xylella fastidiosa. This xylem-limited, insect-transmitted pathogen lives constantly under flow conditions and therefore is highly dependent on TFP for host colonization. In addition, TFP-mediated natural transformation is a process that impacts genomic diversity and environmental fitness. Ten out of the thirty-eight genes analyzed were essential for movement and natural competence. Interestingly, seven sets of paralogs exist, and mutations showed opposing phenotypes, indicating evolutionary neofunctionalization of subunits within TFP. The minor pilin FimT3 was the only protein exclusively required for natural competence. We determined that FimT3 (but not the other two FimT paralogs) is a DNA receptor that is conserved among X. fastidiosa strains and binds DNA non-specifically via an electropositive surface. Among plant pathogens, this gene was also found in the genome of strains of the plant associated Xanthomonadaceae family. Overall, we highlight here the complex regulation of TFP in X. fastidiosa, providing a blueprint to understand TFP in other bacteria living under flow conditions.",

    "abstract": "Expansion of chondrocytes presents a major obstacle in the cartilage regeneration procedure matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI). Dedifferentiation of chondrocytes during the expansion process leads to the emergence of a fibrotic (chondrofibrotic) phenotype that decreases the chondrogenic potential of the implanted cells. We aim to 1) determine the extent that chromatin architecture of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 remodels during dedifferentiation and persists when expanded chondrocytes are transferred to a 3D culture; and 2) to prevent this persistent remodeling to enhance the chondrogenic potential of expanded chondrocytes. Chromatin architecture remodeling of H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 was observed at 0, 8 and 16 population doublings in a two-dimensional (2D) culture and after encapsulation of the expanded chondrocytes in a three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel culture. Chondrocytes were treated with inhibitors of epigenetic modifiers (epigenetic priming) for 16 population doublings and then encapsulated in 3D hydrogels. Chromatin architecture of chondrocytes and gene expression were evaluated before and after encapsulation. We observed a change in chromatin architecture of epigenetic modifications H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 during chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Although inhibiting enzymes that modify H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 did not alter the dedifferentiation process in 2D culture, applying these treatments during the 2D expansion did increase the expression of select chondrogenic genes and protein deposition of type II collagen when transferred to a 3D environment. Overall, we found that epigenetic priming of expanded chondrocytes alters the cell fate when chondrocytes are later encapsulated into a 3D environment, providing a potential method to enhance the success of cartilage regeneration procedures.",

    "abstract": "Bioorthogonal chemistry is a well-established concept for tagging and analyzing targets of interest even in living cells, tissue or organisms. In particular glycans, which are, as a posttranslational modification, not amenable to genetic engineering, became analytically accessible through the establishment of metabolic oligosaccharide engineering and subsequent bioorthogonal tagging of chemical probes. Since many essential cellular processes involve glycoproteins, it is not surprising that especially aberrant glycosylation has been associated with the pathology of many diseases. Investigation of aberrant glycosylation in a disease background is complicated by the heterogeneity of glycans and dynamic changes in their composition. In order to create a meaningful information depth, it can be beneficial to analyze the same sample with different analytical methods. This becomes even more relevant for samples with limited access. Most of the currently existing bioorthogonal probes are designed for use in only one type of experiment. These design restrictions are mainly based on the limited synthetic accessibility of more complex bioorthogonal probes. Multi-step syntheses are often time consuming and cost-inefficient. Here, we introduce a fast and easily manageable strategy for the synthesis of complex bioorthogonal probes that allow an application in multiple coordinated experiments. Using established principles and conditions of solid-phase peptide synthesis, we combine different functional building blocks to generate multi-functional bioorthogonal probes (named Multi-Tags). We show the easy synthesis of several multi-modal probes and demonstrate their applicability and versatility in exemplary assays.",

    "abstract": "Phase separation plays crucial roles in both sustaining cellular function and perpetuating disease states. Despite extensive studies, our understanding of this process is hindered by low solubility of phase-separating proteins. One example of this is found in SR proteins. These proteins are characterized by domains rich in arginine and serine (RS domains), which are essential to alternative splicing, in vivo phase separation, and a low solubility that has made these proteins difficult to study for decades. Here, we solubilize the founding member of the SR family, SRSF1, by introducing a peptide mimicking RS repeats as a co-solute. We find that this RS-mimic peptide forms interactions similar to those of the proteins RS domain. Both interact with a combination of surface-exposed aromatic residues and acidic residues on SRSF1s RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) through electrostatic and cation-pi interactions. Analysis of RRM domains spanning the human proteome indicates that RRM domains involved in phase separation have more exposed aromatic residues and that in phase-separating proteins containing RS repeats, such residues are frequently surrounded by acidic residues. In addition to opening an avenue to previously unavailable proteins, our work provides insight into how SR proteins phase separate and participate in nuclear speckles.",

They establish a feeding site in the host upon infection while secreting hundreds of effectors. These effector proteins are crucial for successful pathogen propagation. Although many effectors have been described, their targets and molecular mode of action are still unknown. Here we report the analysis of the RKN effector, Mj-NEROSs (Meloidogyne javanica nematode effector ROS suppressor), which emerges to have an essential role in suppressing host immunity by inhibiting INF1-induced cell death and reducing callose deposition. Secreted from the subventral esophageal glands to giant cells, Mj-NEROSs localizes in plastids where it interacts with ISP, interfering with the electron transport rate and ROS production. Moreover, our transcriptome analysis shows the downregulation of ROS-related genes upon Mj-NEROSs expression. We propose that Mj-NEROSs manipulates root plastids leading to transcriptional changes, lowering ROS production, and suppressing host immunity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe CYFIP1 gene, located in the neurodevelopmental risk locus 15q11.2, is highly expressed in microglia, but its role in human microglial function as it relates to neurodevelopment is not well understood.\n\nMethodsWe generated multiple CRISPR knockouts of CYFIP1 in patient-derived models of microglia to characterize function and phenotype. Using microglia-like cells reprogrammed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, we quantified phagocytosis of synaptosomes (isolated and purified synaptic vesicles) from human iPSC-derived neuronal cultures as an in vitro model of synaptic pruning. We repeated these analyses in human iPSC-derived microglia, and characterized microglial development and function through morphology and motility.\n\nResultsCYFIP1 knockout using orthogonal CRISPR constructs in multiple patient-derived cell lines was associated with statistically significant decrease in synaptic vesicle phagocytosis in microglia models derived from both PBMCs and iPSCs (p<0.0001). Morphology was also shifted toward a more ramified profile (p<0.0001), and motility was significantly reduced (p<0.0001). However, iPSC-CYFIP1 knockout lines retained the ability to differentiate to functional microglia. Conclusion: The changes in microglial phenotype and function from loss of CYFIP1 may contribute to pruning abnormalities observed in CYFIP1-associated neurodevelopmental disorders. Investigating risk genes in a range of CNS cell types may be required to fully understand the way in which common and rare variants intersect to yield neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "The study of antigen-specific lymphocytes has been a key advancement in immunology the past few decades. The development of multimerized probes containing antigens, peptide:MHC complexes, or other ligands was one innovation allowing the direct study antigen-specific lymphocytes by flow cytometry. While these types of studies are now common and performed by thousands of laboratories, quality control and assessment of probe quality is often minimal. In fact, many of these types of probes are made in-house and protocols vary between labs. While peptide:MHC multimers can often be obtained from commercial sources or core facilities, few such services exist for antigen multimers. To ensure high quality and consistency with ligand probes, we have developed an easy and robust multiplexed approach using commercially available beads able to bind antibodies specific for the ligand of interest. Using this assay, we have sensitively assessed the performance of peptide:MHC and antigen tetramers and find considerable batch-to-batch variability in performance and stability over time. This assay can also reveal common production errors such as miscalculation of antigen concentration. Unexpectedly, probes including the fluorochrome allophycocyanin exhibited more rapid performance decline compared to probes including the fluorochrome R-phycoerythrin when both were stored at 4{degrees}C. This performance decline was reduced for most, but not all, batches when antigen tetramers were instead stored at -20{degrees}C in 50% glycerol. This work could set the stage for the development of standardized assays for all commonly used ligand probes to limit lab-to-lab technical variation, and experimental failure due to probe underperformance.",

Intensive induction therapy successfully induces a complete response in up to 80% of the adult patients but a fraction of them is refractory or relapses. The fraction of non-responsive or relapsing patients is especially high amongst medically unfit and older patients, who cannot undergo aggressive chemotherapy treatment. Therefore, offering patients failing on first line intensive chemotherapy and medically unfit and older patients an effective treatment option for long-term control or even cure of disease represents a significant yet unmet clinical need.\n\nAs a component of the innate immunity, NK cells have recently shown great promise for the treatment of patients with different malignancies. Here, we show that injection of human interleukin-2 (IL-2) complexes (IL-2cx) induce the de novo generation and massive expansion of NK cell precursors in vivo. Furthermore, IL-2cx-expanded NK cells exert effector functions with the capacity to control the growth of non-self MHC class I-deficient RMA-S lymphoma cells in vivo, while remaining tolerant towards MHC class-expressing self RMA cells.\n\nIn an experimental setup mimicking the clinical case of refractory patients after intensive AML induction therapy, IL-2cx treatment mediated strong anti-AML responses following haploidentical bone marrow transplantation without the need for adoptive transfer of donor-derived or in vitro autologous expanded NK cells. Thus, this study demonstrates that IL-2cx immunotherapy allows the in vivo generation and expansion of functionally mature NK cells to achieve long-term response in AML paving the way to an effective treatment option.",

    "abstract": "Zinc is an essential metal for cells, but excess amounts are toxic. Other than by regulating the intracellular zinc concentration by zinc uptake or efflux, the mechanisms underlying bacterial resistance to excess zinc are unknown. In the present study, we searched for zinc-resistant mutant strains from the Keio collection, a gene knockout library of Escherichia coli, a model gram-negative bacteria. We found that knockout mutant of RpmJ, a 50S ribosomal protein, exhibited zinc resistance. The rpmJ mutant was sensitive to protein synthesis inhibitors and had altered translation fidelity, indicating ribosomal dysfunction. In the rpmJ mutant, the intracellular zinc concentration was decreased under excess zinc conditions. RNA sequence analysis revealed that rpmJ knockout decreased the expression of synthetic genes for iron-sulfur cluster proteins, which are toxic targets for zinc. These findings suggest that knocking out RpmJ causes zinc resistance by decreasing zinc targets and lowering the intracellular zinc concentration. Knockouts of other ribosomal proteins, including RplA, RpmE, RpmI, and RpsT, also led to a zinc-resistant phenotype, suggesting that deletion of ribosomal proteins is closely related to zinc resistance.",

We covered the landscape of gene variability and found that the porin forms two major phylogenetic clusters with striking genetic diversity. We generated 14 isogenic mutant strains, each encoding a unique ompU allele, and found that divergent genotypes lead to convergent antimicrobial resistance profiles. We identified and characterized functional domains in OmpU unique to variants conferring AMR-associated phenotypes. Specifically, we identified four conserved domains that are linked with resistance to bile and host-derived antimicrobial peptides. Mutant strains for these domains exhibit differential susceptibility patterns to these and other antimicrobials. Interestingly, a mutant strain in which we exchanged the four domains of the clinical allele for those of a sensitive strain exhibits a resistance profile closer to a porin deletion mutant. Finally, using phenotypic microarrays, we uncovered novel functions of OmpU and their connection with allelic variability. Our findings highlight the suitability of our approach towards dissecting the specific protein domains associated with the emergence of AMR and can be naturally extended to other bacterial pathogens and biological processes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the major threats to global health. To date, tractable approaches that decipher how AMR emerges within a bacterial population remain limited. Here we developed an approach that uses genetic diversity from environmental populations to decode emergent phenotypes such as AMR. Specifically, we examined naturally occurring allelic variants of an outer membrane porin, OmpU, in Vibrio cholerae and established associations between genotype and phenotype. Using this approach, we identified and characterized the functional domains in OmpU unique to variants conferring AMR-associated phenotypes. Our perspective towards disentangling the emergence of AMR can be naturally extended to other proteins and bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The encapsulated fungus Cryptococcus neoformans is the most common cause of fungal meningitis, with the highest rate of disease in patients with AIDS or immunosuppression. This microbe enters the human body via inhalation of infectious particles. C. neoformans capsular polysaccharide, in which the major component is glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), extensively accumulates in tissues and compromises host immune responses. C. neoformans travels from the lungs to the bloodstream and crosses to the brain via transcytosis, paracytosis, or inside of phagocytes using a \"Trojan horse\" mechanism. The fungus causes life-threatening meningoencephalitis with high mortality rates. Hence, we investigated the impact of intranasal exogenous GXM administration on C. neoformans infection in C57BL/6 mice. GXM enhances cryptococcal pulmonary infection and facilitates fungal systemic dissemination and brain invasion. Pre-challenge of GXM results in detection of the polysaccharide in lungs, serum, and surprisingly brain, the latter likely reached through the nasal cavity. GXM significantly alters endothelial cell tight junction protein expression in vivo, suggesting significant implications for the C. neoformans mechanisms of brain invasion. Using a microtiter transwell system, we showed that GXM disrupts the trans-endothelial electrical resistance, weakening the human brain endothelial cell monolayers co-cultured with pericytes, supportive cells of blood vessels/capillaries found in the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and promotes C. neoformans BBB penetration. Our findings should be considered in the development of therapeutics to combat the devastating complications of cryptococcosis that results in an estimated [~]200,000 deaths worldwide each year.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYCryptococcus neoformans infection of the central nervous system (CNS) typically begins by inhalation of fungal spores and results in devastating mortality rates worldwide. Over 200,000 deaths have been reported annually, with cryptococcal meningoencephalitis being the most severe form of the disease. This study investigates the ability of the fungus to invade, colonize, and cause damage to the host through properties of the fungal polysaccharide capsule, which allows the microbe a variety of both protective and offensive abilities. This capsule, made primarily of the polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM), has been implicated in the progression and severity of cryptococcal infection in the CNS. We determined that GXM increases the fungal burden in the lungs of mice and enhances fungal migration to the brain. Interaction of GXM with the blood-brain barrier, which is a protective structure that regulates movement of particles into the CNS, demonstrated that GXM can disrupt the integrity of this barrier, compromising the delicate balances of fluids, immune cells, and other factors vital to the maintenance of the CNS. The findings of this study reveal the substantial role of GXM in establishing C. neoformans infection in the brain and necessitate future studies to further understand these interactions.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe murine CBA/J mouse model widely supports immunology and enteric pathogen research. This model has illuminated Salmonella interactions with the gut microbiome since pathogen proliferation does not require disruptive pretreatment of the native microbiota, nor does it become systemic, thereby representing an analog to gastroenteritis disease progression in humans. Despite the value to broad research communities, microbiota in CBA/J mice are not represented in current murine microbiome genome catalogs.\n\nResultsHere we present the first microbial and viral genomic catalog of the CBA/J murine gut microbiome. Using fecal microbial communities from untreated and Salmonella-infected, highly inflamed mice, we performed genomic reconstruction to determine the impacts on gut microbiome membership and functional potential. From high depth whole community sequencing (~42.4 Gbps/sample), we reconstructed 2,281 bacterial and 4,129 viral draft genomes. Salmonella challenge significantly altered gut membership in CBA/J mice, revealing 30 genera and 98 species that were conditionally rare and unsampled in non-inflamed mice. Additionally, inflamed communities were depleted in microbial genes that modulate host anti-inflammatory pathways and enriched in genes for respiratory energy generation. Our findings suggest decreases in butyrate concentrations during Salmonella infection corresponded to reductions in the relative abundance in members of the Alistipes. Strain-level comparison of CBA/J microbial genomes to prominent murine gut microbiome databases identified newly sampled lineages in this resource, while comparisons to human gut microbiomes extended the host relevance of dominant CBA/J inflammation resistant strains.\n\nConclusionsThis CBA/J microbiome database provides the first genomic sampling of relevant, uncultivated microorganisms within the gut from this widely used laboratory model. Using this resource, we curated a functional, strain-resolved view on how Salmonella remodels intact murine gut communities, advancing pathobiome understanding beyond inferences from prior amplicon-based approaches. Salmonella-induced inflammation suppressed Alistipes and other dominant members, while rarer commensals like Lactobacillus and Enterococcus endure. The rare and novel species sampled across this inflammation gradient advance the utility of this microbiome resource to benefit the broad research needs of the CBA/J scientific community, and those using murine models for understanding the impact of inflammation on the gut microbiome more generally.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria use Quorum sensing (QS) to coordinate gene expression in dense cell populations. Here, we show that eukaryote S. Cerevisiae uses an alternative strategy, the quorum mechano-sensing (QMS), to resolve growth conflicts in the fungal consortia. QMS connects the biomechanical signal perception through adhesin FLO11 and transmembrane histidine kinase SLN1, triggering an intracellular signaling cascade for the cell density-dependent regulation of gene expression. Both cis and trans interactions of FLO11 are required for the inhibition of SLN1 and involve the extracellular fibronectin type III-like domain of FLO11. Genetic deletion of FLO11 removes inhibition of SLN1, associated with the spontaneous activation of gene expression whereas overproduction of FLO11 strengthens the inhibitory effect of FLO11 on SLN1. Therefore, adjusting the amount of FLO11 directly scales with the level of SLN1 inhibition, forecasting the outcome of growth competition at the macroscopic scale. Furthermore, the integration of an orthogonal synthetic circuit downstream of SLN1 allows for QMS-controlled regulation of gene expression in cell populations. Our study reveals a molecular pathway connecting FLO11 adhesion to SLN1-dependent intracellular regulation of gene expression in fungi. FLO11 and SLN1 coordinate kin recognition and growth conflict resolution through gene expression in dense fungal populations. This study challenges the classical view of chemically-driven QS and provides new strategies for controlling population growth through quorum mechano-sensing.",

Tuft cells express the succinate receptor SUCNR1, yet this receptor does not mediate anti-helminth immunity nor alter protist colonization. Here, we report that microbial-derived succinate increases Paneth cell numbers and profoundly alters the antimicrobial peptide (AMP) landscape in the small intestine. Succinate was sufficient to drive this epithelial remodeling, but not in mice lacking tuft cell chemosensory components required to detect this metabolite. Tuft cells respond to succinate by stimulating type 2 immunity, leading to interleukin-13-mediated epithelial and AMP expression changes. Moreover, type 2 immunity decreases the total number of mucosa-associated bacteria and alters the small intestinal microbiota composition. These findings demonstrate that a single metabolite produced by commensals, like T. mu, can markedly shift the intestinal AMP profile and suggest that tuft cells utilize SUCNR1 to modulate bacterial homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "The GAL pathway of yeasts has long served as a model system for understanding of how regulatory mode of eukaryotic metabolic pathways evolves. While Gal4 mode has been well-characterized in Saccharomycetaceae clade, little is known about the regulation of the GAL pathway in other yeasts. Here, we find that Rep1, a Ndt80-like family transcription factor, serves as a galactose sensor in the commensal-pathogenic fungus Candida albicans. It is presented at the GAL gene promoters independent of the presence of galactose. Rep1 recognizes galactose via a direct physical interaction. The net result of this interaction is the recruitment of a transcriptional activator Cga1 (Candida galactose gene activator, orf19.4959) and transcription of the GAL genes proceeds. Rep1 and Cga1 are conserved across the CTG species. Rep1 itself does not possess transcriptional activity. Instead, it provides a scaffold to recruit different factors for transcriptional regulation. Rep1-Cga1 mode of regulation represents a new example of network rewiring in fungi, which provides insight into how C. albicans evolves transcriptional programs to colonize diverse host niches.",

Despite successful vaccination programs in the Americas and many developed countries, rubella remains endemic in many regions worldwide and outbreaks occur wherever population immunity is insufficient. Intense interest since rubella virus was first isolated in 1962 has advanced our understanding of clinical outcomes after infection disrupts key processes of fetal neurodevelopment. Yet it is still largely unknown which cell types in the developing brain are targeted. We show that in human brain slices, rubella virus predominantly infects microglia. This infection occurs in a heterogeneous population but not in a highly microglia-enriched monoculture in the absence of other cell types. By using an organoid-microglia model, we further demonstrate that rubella virus infection leads to a profound interferon response in non-microglial cells, including neurons and neural progenitor cells, and this response is attenuated by the presence of microglia.",

    "abstract": "The mobility of transposable elements (TEs) contributes to evolution of genomes 1,2. Meanwhile, their uncontrolled activity causes genomic instability and therefore expression of TEs is silenced by host genomes 3,4. TEs are marked with DNA and H3K9 methylation that are associated with silencing in flowering plants 5, animals, and fungi 6. Yet, in distantly related eukaryotes TEs are instead marked by H3K27me3 deposited by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) 7-11, an epigenetic mark associated with gene silencing in multicellular eukaryotes 12-15. It was therefore proposed that the ancestral activity of PRC2 was the deposition of H3K27me3 to silence TEs 16.\n\nTo test this hypothesis we obtained mutants deprived of PRC2 activity and used genomics to analyze the role of PRC2 in extant species along the lineage of Archaeplastida. While in the red alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae more TEs than genes were repressed by PRC2, an opposite trend was observed in bryophytes Marchantia polymorpha and Anthoceros agrestis. In the red alga, TEs silenced by H3K27me3 are in subtelomeres but in bryophytes, TEs and genes marked by H3K27me3 form coregulated transcriptional units. The latter trend was also observed in the flowering plant Arabidopsis thaliana, and we identified cis-elements recognised by transcription factors in TEs flanking genes repressed by PRC2.\n\nTogether with the silencing of TEs by PRC2 in ciliates that diverged early from an ancestor common with Archaeplastida, our findings support the hypothesis that PRC2 deposited H3K27me3 to silence TEs in early lineages of eukaryotes.

A mechanistic understanding of such responses is crucial for further insight into mitochondrial biology and diseases. Through an unbiased genetic screen in Drosophila, we identify that mutations in lrpprc2, a homolog of the human LRPPRC gene that is linked to the French-Canadian Leigh syndrome, results in PINK1-Park activation. While the PINK1-Park pathway is well known to induce mitophagy, we show that in the case of lrpprc2 mutants, PINK1-Park regulates mitochondrial dynamics by inducing degradation of the mitochondrial fusion protein Mitofusin/Marf. We also discover that Bendless, a K63-linked E2 conjugase, is a regulator of Marf, as loss of bendless results in increased Marf levels. We show that Bendless is required for PINK1 stability, and subsequently for PINK1-Park mediated Marf degradation under physiological conditions, and in response to mitochondrial stress as seen in lrpprc2. Additionally, we show that loss of Bendless in lrpprc2 mutant eye results in photoreceptor degeneration, indicating a neuroprotective role for Bendless-PINK1-Park mediated Marf degradation. Based on our observations, we propose that certain forms of mitochondrial stress activate Bendless-PINK1-Park to limit mitochondrial fusion, which is a cell-protective response.",

    "abstract": "Citrus is one of the most important tree crops worldwide and citrus production is threatened by Huanglongbing (HLB), a devasting citrus disease caused by Candidatus Liberibacter. HLB is a pathogen-triggered immune disease, in which the pathogen initiates systemic and chronic immune responses including the excessive production of reactive oxidative species, which subsequently lead to cell death of phloem tissues and HLB disease symptoms. Here, we identified putative genetic determinants of HLB pathogenicity by integrating citrus genomic resources to characterize the pan-genome of accessions that differ in their response to HLB. Genome-wide association mapping and analysis of allele-specific expression between susceptible, tolerant, and resistant accessions further refined candidates underlying the response to HLB. To enable these analyses we first developed a phased diploid assembly of Citrus sinensis  Newhall genome and produced resequencing data for 91 citrus accessions that differ in their response to HLB. These data were combined with previous resequencing data from 356 sequenced accessions for genome-wide association mapping of the HLB response. Genes with HLB pathogenicity were associated with the host immune response, ROS production, and antioxidants. Overall, this study has provided a significant recourse of citrus genomic data and we have identified candidate genes to be further explored to understand the genetic determinants of HLB pathogenicity and to generate HLB resistant/tolerant citrus varieties.",

We then explore this cell-free in vitro system as a realistic, functional model for the in situ investigation of matrix-controlled mineralization processes.

    "abstract": "Many proteins bind transition metal ions as cofactors to carry out their biological functions. Despite binding affinities for divalent transition metal ions being predominantly dictated by the Irving-Williams series for wild-type proteins, in vivo metal ion binding specificity is ensured by intracellular mechanisms that regulate free metal ion concentrations. However, a growing area of biotechnology research considers the use of metal-binding proteins in vitro to purify specific metal ions from wastewater, where specificity is dictated by the proteins metal binding affinities. A goal of metalloprotein engineering is to modulate these affinities to improve a proteins specificity towards a particular metal; however, the quantitative relationship between the affinities and the equilibrium metal-bound protein fractions depends on the underlying binding kinetics. Here we demonstrate a high-throughput intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence quenching method to validate kinetic models in multi-metal solutions for CcNikZ-II, a nickel-binding protein from Clostridium carboxidivorans. Using our validated models, we quantify the relationship between binding affinity and specificity in different classes of metal-binding models for CcNikZ-II. We further demonstrate that principles for improving specificity through changes in binding affinity are qualitatively different depending on the competing metals, highlighting the power of mechanistic models to guide metalloprotein engineering targets.",

    "abstract": "Cancer cells outgrowing in distant organs of metastasis rewire their metabolism to fuel on the available nutrients. While this is often considered an adaptive pressure limiting metastasis formation, some nutrients available at the metastatic site naturally or through changes in organ physiology may inherently promote metastatic growth. We find that the lung, a frequent site of metastasis, is a lipid-rich environment. Moreover, we observe that pathological conditions such as pre-metastatic niche formation and obesity further increase the availability of the fatty acid palmitate in the lung. We find that targeting palmitate processing inhibits spheroid growth in vitro and metastasis formation in lean and obese mice. Mechanistically, we discover that breast cancer cells use palmitate to synthesize acetyl-CoA in a carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (CPT1a)-dependent manner. Lysine acetyltransferase 2a (KAT2a), whose expression is promoted by palmitate availability, relies on the available acetyl-CoA to acetylate the NF-{kappa}B subunit p65. This favors nuclear location of p65 and activates a pro-metastatic transcriptional program. Accordingly, deletion of KAT2a phenocopies CPT1a silencing in vitro as well as in vivo and patients with breast cancer show co-expression of both proteins in metastases across palmitate-rich metastatic sites. In conclusion, we find that palmitate-rich environments foster metastasis growth by increasing p65 acetylation resulting in elevated NF-{kappa}B signaling.",

    "abstract": "During development, the complex neuronal circuitry of the brain arises from limited information contained in the genome. After the genetic code instructs the birth of neurons, the emergence of brain regions, and the formation of axon tracts, it is believed that neuronal activity plays a critical role in shaping circuits for behavior. Current AI technologies are modeled after the same principle: connections in an initial weight matrix are pruned and strengthened by activity-dependent signals until the network can sufficiently generalize a set of inputs into outputs. Here, we challenge these learning-dominated assumptions by quantifying the contribution of neuronal activity to the development of visually guided swimming behavior in larval zebrafish. Intriguingly, dark-rearing zebrafish revealed that visual experience has no effect on the emergence of the optomotor response (OMR). We then raised animals under conditions where neuronal activity was pharmacologically silenced from organogenesis onward using the sodium-channel blocker tricaine. Strikingly, after washout of the anesthetic, animals performed swim bouts and responded to visual stimuli with 75% accuracy in the OMR paradigm. After shorter periods of silenced activity OMR performance stayed above 90% accuracy, calling into question the importance and impact of classical critical periods for visual development. Detailed quantification of the emergence of functional circuit properties by brain-wide imaging experiments confirmed that neuronal circuits came  online fully tuned and without the requirement for activity-dependent plasticity. Thus, we find that complex sensory guided behaviors can be wired up by activity-independent developmental mechanisms.",

However, the virulence mechanisms underlying worse outcomes caused by antibiotic resistant infections are poorly understood. Here, we investigated evolved aztreonam resistant P. aeruginosa virulence mechanisms. Using a macrophage infection model combined with genomic and transcriptomic analyses, we show that a compensatory mutation in the rne gene, encoding RNase E, increased siderophore gene expression, causing macrophage ferroptosis and lysis. Macrophage killing could be eliminated by treatment with the iron mimetic gallium. RNase E variants were abundant in clinical isolates, and CF sputum gene expression data show that clinical isolates phenocopied RNase E variant functions during macrophage infection.

    "abstract": "The Eger Rift subsurface is characterized by frequent seismic activity and consistently high CO2 concentrations, making it a unique deep biosphere ecosystem and a suitable site to study the interactions between volcanism, tectonics, and microbiological activity. Pulses of geogenic H2 during earthquakes may provide substrates for methanogenic and chemolithotrophic processes, but very little is currently known about the role of subsurface microorganisms and their cellular processes in this type of environment. To assess the impact of geologic activity on microbial life, we analyzed the geological, geochemical, and microbiological composition of rock and sediment samples from a 240 m deep drill core, running across six lithostratigraphic zones. In addition, we evaluated diversity as well as metabolic attributes of bacterial and archaeal communities. Our investigation revealed a distinct low biomass community, with a surprisingly diverse Archaea population, providing strong support that methanogenic archaea reside in the Eger subsurface. Geochemical analysis revealed sulfate and sodium concentrations as high as 1000 mg L-1 in sediment samples from a depth between 50 and 100 m and in weathered rock samples collected below 200 m.\n\nMost microbial signatures could be assigned to common soil and water bacteria, which together with the occurrence of freshwater Cyanobacteria at specific depths, emphasize the heterogenous, groundwater movement driven nature of this terrestrial subsurface environment. Although not as frequently and abundantly as initially expected, our investigations also found evidence for anaerobic, autotrophic, and acidophilic communities in Eger Rift sediments, as sulfur cycling taxa like Thiohalophilus and Desulfosporosinus were specifically enriched at depths below 100 m. The detection of methanogenic, halophilic, and ammonia oxidizing archaeal populations demonstrate that the unique features of the Eger Rift subsurface environment provide the foundation for diverse types of microbial life, including the microbial utilization of geologically derived CO2 and when available H2, as a primary energy source.",

    "abstract": "Influenza A virus exhibits high rates of replicative failure due to a variety of genetic defects. Most influenza virions cannot, when acting as individual particles, complete the entire viral life cycle. Nevertheless influenza is incredibly successful in the suppression of innate immune detection and the production of interferons, remaining undetected in >99% of cells in tissue-culture models of infection. Notably, the same variation that leads to replication failure can, by chance, inactivate the major innate immune antagonist in influenza A virus, NS1. What explains the observed rarity of interferon production in spite of the frequent loss of this, critical, antagonist? By studying how genetic and phenotypic variation in a viral population lacking NS1 correlates with interferon production, we have built a model of the \"worst-case\" failure from an improved understanding of the steps at which NS1 acts in the viral life cycle to prevent the triggering of an innate immune response. In doing so, we find that NS1 prevents the detection of de novo innate immune ligands, defective viral genomes, and viral export from the nucleus, although only generation of de novo ligands appears absolutely required for enhanced detection of virus in the absence of NS1. Due to this, the highest frequency of interferon production we observe (97% of infected cells) requires a high level of replication in the presence of defective viral genomes with NS1 bearing an inactivating mutation that does not impact its partner encoded on the same segment, NEP. This is incredibly unlikely to occur given the standard variation found within a viral population, and would generally require direct, artificial, intervention to achieve at an appreciable rate. Thus from our study, we procure at least a partial explanation for the seeming contradiction between high rates of replicative failure and the rarity of the interferon response to influenza infection.\n\nAuthor summaryThe production of interferons in response to viral threat is a potent barrier to successful infection. Viruses like influenza A virus encode potent interferon antagonists, suppressing detection of viral replication such that only an incredibly small number of cells successfully produce interferons. Strikingly, even in the absence of its major interferon antagonist, NS1, influenza still only induces an interferon response in a minority of infected cells. Using a combination of single-cell RNAseq, flow cytometry, and classical bulk methods, we explored how heterogeneity, both genetic and phenotypic, in a virus lacking NS1, explains the observed rarity of the interferon response. In doing so, we find that, in the absence of NS1, viral replication is absolutely required to induce an interferon response, and that both active export and the presence of defective viral genomes can greatly enhance, but are not strictly required, for the detection of this virus. The confluence of events which we find maximizes the host response is incredibly unlikely to occur alongside the absence of the NS1 protein via the most common forms of genetic variation in the viral population, perhaps explaining, in part, how a virus with such a high error rate nevertheless has such a high rate of success at evading cell intrinsic innate immunity.",

    "abstract": "High relative abundance of oral bacteria in the gut is considered abnormal and has been linked to intestinal disorders. However, this reported association has two alternate explanations: ectopic oral bacteria may increase in absolute numbers in the intestine and drive disease (the driver hypothesis) or, instead, intestinal commensals may decrease in absolute numbers and the relative rise in oral bacteria is simply an indicator of this loss (the marker hypothesis). Here we use experiments in mice and clinical data from patients to provide evidence in favor of the marker hypothesis. We demonstrate that depletion of intestinal bacteria by antibiotics increases the relative abundance of oral bacteria in the host feces without increasing their absolute abundance, and the relative enrichment can indicate host health parameters such as stool consistency, pathogen overgrowth, and immunity. Our results reframe the conventional interpretation of microbiome sequencing data with implications for intestinal disorders and microbiome therapies.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDThe first cause of mortality worldwide is ischemic heart disease. In myocardial infarction (MI), the ischemic event causes cell death, which triggers a large inflammatory response responsible for removing necrotic material and inducing tissue repair. Endothelial cells, immune cells and fibroblasts play a key role in orchestrating this healing process. TRPM4 is a Ca2+-activated ion channel permeable to monovalent cations and its silencing or knocking out was shown to critically modify cellular functions of these non-myocytic cell types.\n\nOBJECTIVEOur aims were to 1) evaluate the role of TRPM4 on mice survival and cardiac function after MI; and 2) investigate the role of TRPM4 in the post-MI acute and chronic inflammatory response.\n\nMETHODSWe performed ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery or sham intervention on 154 Trpm4 WT or KO male mice and monitored survival for up to 5 weeks as well as cardiac function using echocardiography at 72h and five weeks. We drew blood at different acute time points (6h, 12h, 24h) and performed time-of-flight mass spectrometry to analyze the sera proteomes. Further, we sacrificed sub-groups of mice at 24h and 72h after surgery and performed single-cell RNA sequencing on the non-myocytic cells. Lastly, we assessed fibrosis and angiogenesis at five weeks using type I collagen and CD31 immunostaining respectively.\n\nRESULTSWe observed no significant differences in survival or cardiac function post-MI between both genotypes. However, our serum proteomics data showed significantly decreased tissue injury markers such as creatine kinase M and VE-Cadherin in KO compared to WT 12h after MI. On the other hand, inflammation characterized by serum amyloid P component in the serum, as well as higher number of recruited granulocytes, M1 macrophages, M1 monocytes, Mac-6 macrophages, and expression of pro-inflammatory genes such as Il1b, Lyz2 and S100a8/a9 was significantly higher in endothelial cells, macrophages and fibroblasts of KO than of WT. This correlated with increased cardiac fibrosis and angiogenesis 5 weeks after MI in KO.\n\nCONCLUSIONOur data suggest that knocking out Trpm4 drastically increases acute inflammation post-MI, is associated with increased chronic fibrosis and does not improve survival at 5 weeks post-MI. Thus, targeting TRPM4 in the context of MI should be pondered carefully and approaches that nuance the timing of the inhibition or cellular target may be required.",

    "abstract": "Vascular dysfunction is a common cause of cardiovascular diseases characterized by the narrowing and stiffening of arteries, such as atherosclerosis, restenosis, and hypertension. Arterial narrowing results from the aberrant proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and their increased synthesis and deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. These, in turn, are modulated by arterial stiffness, but the mechanism for this is not fully understood. We found that survivin (an inhibitor of apoptosis) is an important regulator of stiffness-mediated ECM synthesis and intracellular stiffness in VSMCs. Whole-transcriptome analysis and cell culture experiments showed that survivin expression is upregulated in injured femoral arteries in mice and in human VSMCs cultured on stiff fibronectin-coated hydrogels. Suppressed expression of survivin in human VSMCs and mouse embryonic fibroblasts decreased the stiffness-mediated expression of ECM components implicated in arterial stiffness, namely, collagen-I, fibronectin, and lysyl oxidase. By contrast, expression of these proteins was upregulated by the overexpression of survivin in human VSMCs cultured on soft hydrogels. Atomic force microscopy analysis showed that suppressed or enhanced expression of survivin decreases or increases intracellular stiffness, respectively. These findings suggest a novel mechanism by which survivin modulates arterial stiffness.",

    "abstract": "Heterochromatin is a condensed chromatin structure that represses transcription of repetitive DNA elements and developmental genes, and is required for genome stability. Paradoxically, transcription of heterochromatic sequences is required for establishment of heterochromatin in diverse eukaryotic species. As such, components of the transcriptional machinery can play important roles in establishing heterochromatin. How these factors coordinate with heterochromatin proteins at nascent heterochromatic transcripts remains poorly understood. In the model eukaryote Schizosaccharomcyes pombe (S. pombe), heterochromatin nucleation can be coupled to processing of nascent transcripts by the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, or to other post-transcriptional mechanisms that are RNAi-independent. Here we show that the RNA polymerase II processivity factor Spt5 negatively regulates heterochromatin in S. pombe through its C-terminal domain (CTD). The Spt5 CTD is analogous to the CTD of the RNA polymerase II large subunit, and is comprised of multiple repeats of an amino acid motif that is phosphorylated by Cdk9. We provide evidence that genetic ablation of Spt5 CTD phosphorylation results in aberrant RNAi-dependent nucleation of heterochromatin at an ectopic location, as well as inappropriate spread of heterochromatin proximal to centromeres. In contrast, truncation of Spt5 CTD repeat number enhanced RNAi-independent heterochromatin formation and bypassed the requirement for RNAi. We relate these phenotypes to the known Spt5 CTD-binding factor Rtf1. This separation of function argues that Spt5 CTD phosphorylation and CTD length restrict heterochromatin through unique mechanisms. More broadly, our findings argue that Spt5 CTD repeat length and phosphorylation have distinct regulatory effects on transcription.",

We demonstrate that the current default tool fails to detect mutant gRNAs. We therefore developed GiRAFR, a pysam-based software tool to characterize intact and mutant gRNAs. We show that mutant gRNAs are dysfunctional, and failure to detect and annotate them leads to an inflated estimate of the number of untransformed cells as well as an underestimated multiplet frequency. These findings are mirrored in publicly available datasets, where we find that up to 34 % of cells are transduced with a mutant gRNA.

    "abstract": "Molecular mechanisms underlying the diverse therapeutic effects of anti-diabetic metformin, beyond its anti-hyperglycaemic effects, remain largely unclear. Metformin is reported to reduce the long-term complications of diabetes, including cardiovascular fibrosis and remodelling. Our recent investigations show that Discoidin Domain Receptor 2 (DDR2), a collagen receptor tyrosine kinase, has an obligate regulatory role in collagen type I gene expression in cardiac and vascular adventitial fibroblasts, and that it may be a molecular link between arterial fibrosis and metabolic syndrome in rhesus monkeys. Using gene knockdown and over-expression approaches, the present study examined whether DDR2 is a target of metformin, and whether, by targeting DDR2, it inhibits fibronectin and collagen expression in vascular adventitial fibroblasts exposed to hyperglycaemic conditions. Metformin was found to attenuate hyperglycaemia-induced increase in DDR2 mRNA and protein expression by inhibiting TGF-{beta}1/ Smad2/3 signalling that mediates the stimulatory effect of hyperglycaemia on DDR2 expression. Metformin also inhibited DDR2-dependent expression of fibronectin and collagen, indicating that it regulates these matrix proteins via DDR2 inhibition. The findings identify DDR2, a major mediator of cardiovascular remodelling, as a molecular target of metformin, thereby uncovering the molecular basis of its protective role in vascular fibrosis, and possibly, cardiac fibrosis associated with diabetic cardiomyopathy.",

    "abstract": "Female fertility is dictated by the number of oocyte-containing primordial follicles within the ovary. These follicles are established early in development and their selective activation represents the definitive first step towards oocyte maturation and ovulation. The intrinsic molecular mechanisms that regulate ovarian follicle activation are largely uncharacterised. In this study, we report a single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) dataset to examine mouse embryonic and neonatal ovaries across the developmental window of primordial follicle formation and activation. We identified five distinct clusters of granulosa cells and bioinformatic analysis revealed a population of pregranulosa cells that appeared to be undergoing follicle activation. This cluster was uniquely differentiated by the expression of Tnni3, Slc18a2, Fam13a and Klf2, all of which are novel to follicle activation. Finally, we examined the transcriptome of a mouse model where all primordial follicles enter folliculogenesis simultaneously (Cdkn1b-/-) and showed that the signature genes of activating pregranulosa cells was observed precociously in Cdkn1b-/- ovaries, further demonstrating that p27kip1 acts as an important repressor of follicle activation.
