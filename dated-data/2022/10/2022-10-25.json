    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a progressive neurodevelopmental disorder characterized mainly by deficits in social communication and stereotyped and restricted interests. Deficits in social interactions in ASD animal models are generally analysed using the three chambers test paradigm that is simple to implement and use but fails to detect subtle social deficits or complex social behavior on an extended period of time within a group of mice. Here, we set up a novel procedure entitled the Live Mouse Tracker (LMT) that detects a great number of complex social behaviours that we recorded continuously for up to three days in groups of 4 mice. This was performed in the valproic acid (VPA) mouse model where VPA (450 mg/kg) was injected to pregnant females at E12.5. Studies were performed with a special focus on females given that ASD is 3-4 times more diagnosed in males than in females and that several ASD models failed to detect major social deficits in females, contrary to males. Comparisons were made within groups of 4 female animals with same treatment or within groups of different treatments (saline versus VPA). We report that VPA females show several types of social deficits and that are different in nature and magnitude in relation with time (from 1 hour to 3 days). These deficits were also different when VPA mice were tested together compared to when they were mixed with saline treated mice. Indeed, while social behavior was improved in VPA mice with the presence of saline mice that of saline mice was negatively affected by the presence of VPA mice.\n\nThis study indicates that female VPA mice show several social deficits, contrary to the common knowledge. It further implies that ASD related behavior alters normal behavior in a mixed group of mice.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic changes at specific genetic loci and the activation of transcriptional repressor FOXP3 are needed to establish and maintain the regulatory T cell (Treg) lineage. Here we studied the DNA methylation profiles in CD4+ CD25+ Tregs and CD4+ CD25- conventional T cells (Tconvs) from healthy individuals and identified a wide range of differentially methylated CpG sites (DMPs). Overall, Tregs had more hypomethylated DMPs and contained more CpG sites, which on the cell population level were less defined in their methylation status. We identified top hypomethylated CpGs in Tregs close to CENPM, IKZF2, and LYST and hypermethylated sites at the THEMIS, SCML4, and ADD3 genes. Among others, DMPs were enriched for the transcriptional repressor Kaiso binding motifs. Interestingly, in Tregs we found hypomethylation and increased expression of the TSHR gene, which is a risk gene for Graves disease (GD). However, subsequent DNA methylation profiling in healthy individuals and GD patients revealed only 19 DMPs and no change at the TSHR locus, indicating that Tregs in GD patients share a similar methylation pattern with healthy controls. Together, we show Treg-specific hypomethylation and expression of the TSHR gene, prompting additional scenarios to explain the genetic link and role of anti-TSHR autoantibodies in GD.",

    "abstract": "Multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii are of major concern worldwide due to their resistance to last resort carbapenem and polymyxin antibiotics. To develop an effective treatment strategy, it is critical to better understand how an A. baumannii MDR bacterium interacts with its mammalian host. Pattern-recognition receptors sense microbes, and activate the inflammasome pathway, leading to pro-inflammatory cytokine production and programmed cell death. Here, we found that MDR A. baumannii activate the NLRP3 inflammasome complex predominantly via the non-canonical caspase-11-dependent pathway. We show that caspase-11-deficient mice are protected from a virulent MDR A. baumannii strain by maintaining a balance between protective and deleterious inflammation via IL-1. Caspase-11-deficient mice also compromise between effector cell recruitment, phagocytosis, and programmed cell death in the lung during infection. Importantly, we found that cytosolic immunity - mediated by guanylate-binding protein 1 (GBP1) and type I interferon signalling - orchestrates caspase-11-dependent inflammasome activation. This exerts a bactericidal activity against carbapenem- and colistin-resistant, lipooligosaccharide (LOS)- deficient bacteria. Together, our results suggest that developing therapeutic strategies targeting GBP1 might pave the way as a host-directed therapy to overcome multidrug resistance in A. baumannii infection.",

    "abstract": "In vivo matured oocytes exhibit higher developmental competence than those matured in vitro, but mimicking the in vivo environment by in vitro conditions has been challenging. Till now, conventional two-dimensional (2D) systems have been used for in vitro maturation of bovine cumulus-oocytes-complexes (COCs). However, using such systems may cause cell flattening and does not allow cumulus expansion in all dimensions, which is less physiological. Therefore, implementing a low-cost and highly effective in vivo-like microenvironment methodology may help to optimize oocyte in vitro maturation. Here, we used two different systems to culture COCs and evaluate their potential influence on embryo development and quality. In the first system, we used treated fumed silica particles to create a 3D microenvironment (liquid marbles; LM) to mature COCs. In the second system, we cultured COCs in 96-well plates with different dimensions (flat, ultra-low attachment round-bottom, and V-shaped 96-well plates). In both systems, the nuclear maturation rate remained similar to the control in 2D, showing that most oocytes reached metaphase II. However, the subsequent blastocyst rate remained lower in the liquid marble system compared to 96-well plates and control 2D systems. Interestingly, a lower total cell number was found in the resulting embryos from both systems (LM and 96-well plates) compared to the control. In conclusion, oocytes matured in liquid marbles or 96-well plates showed no remarkable change in terms of meiotic resumption, embryo development, and quality in both systems. None of the surface geometries influenced embryo development. These findings provide important inferences in many aspects of oocyte and embryo development. Further investigation is needed to determine other aspects like toxicity testing and ultrastructural changes in oocytes.",

    "abstract": "In many grasslands, species with specific traits occupy unique temporal positions within communities. Such intra-annual segregation is predicted to be greatest in systems with high intra-annual climate variability because fluctuating environmental conditions provide opportunities for temporal niche partitioning among species. However, because most studies on intra-annual community dynamics have been conducted at individual sites, relationships between intra-annual climate variability and seasonal community dynamics at global scales have not yet been identified. Furthermore, the same characteristics that promote species-specific responses to fluctuations in environmental conditions may also drive species-specific responses to global change drivers such as eutrophication. Research provides evidence that eutrophication alters inter-annual plant community dynamics yet understanding of how it alters intra-annual dynamics remains limited.\n\nWe used early-season and late-season compositional data collected from 10 grassland sites around the world to ask how intra-annual variability in precipitation and temperature as well as nutrient enrichment shape intra-annual species segregation, or seasonal {beta}-diversity, in plant communities. We also assessed whether changes in the abundances of specific functional groups including annual forbs, perennial forbs, C3 and C4 graminoids, and legumes underpin compositional differences between early- and late-season communities and treatments. We found that intra-annual temperature variability and seasonal {beta}-diversity were positively related but observed no relationship between intra-annual precipitation variability and seasonal {beta}-diversity. This suggests that positive relationships between -diversity and intra-annual temperature variability identified in earlier studies may be underpinned by the positive influence of intra-annual temperature variability on temporal segregation of species within growing seasons. We found that nutrient enrichment increased seasonal {beta}-diversity via increased turnover of species between early- and late-season communities. This finding mirrors patterns observed at inter-annual scales and suggests fertilization can alter compositional dynamics via similar mechanisms at varied temporal scales. Finally, fertilization reduced the abundance of C4 graminoids and legumes and eliminated intra-annual differences in these groups. In contrast, fertilization resulted in intra-annual differences in C3 graminoids which were not observed in control conditions, and increased abundance of C3 graminoids and annual forbs overall. Our study provides new insight into how intra-annual climate variability and nutrient enrichment influence biodiversity and seasonal dynamics in global grasslands.",

    "abstract": "Artificial light at night (ALAN) threatens natural ecosystems globally. While ALAN research is increasing, little is known about how ALAN affects plants and interactions with other organisms. We explored the effects of ALAN on plant defence and plant-insect interactions using barley (Hordeum vulgare) and the English grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). Plants were exposed to  full or  part nights of 15-20 lux ALAN, or no ALAN  control nights, to test the effects of ALAN on plant growth and defence. Although plant growth was only minimally affected by ALAN, aphid colony growth and aphid maturation were reduced significantly by ALAN treatments. Importantly, we found strong differences between full-night and part-night ALAN treatments. Contrary to our expectations, part ALAN had stronger negative effects on aphid colony growth than full ALAN. Defence-associated gene expression was affected in some cases by ALAN, but also positively correlated with aphid colony size, suggesting that the effects of ALAN on plant defences are indirect, and regulated via direct disruption of aphid colonies, rather than via ALAN-induced upregulation of defences. Mitigating ecological side effects of ALAN is a complex problem, as reducing exposure to ALAN increased its negative impact on insect herbivores.",

    "abstract": "RNA 3D structure prediction remains challenging though after years of efforts. Inspired by the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction, we developed trRosettaRNA, a novel deep learning-based approach to de novo prediction of RNA 3D structure. Like trRosetta, the trRosettaRNA pipeline comprises two major steps: 1D and 2D geometries prediction by a transformer network; and full-atom 3D structure folding by energy minimization with constraints from the predicted geometries. We benchmarked trRosettaRNA on two independent datasets. The results show that trRosettaRNA outperforms other conventional methods by a large margin. For example, on 25 targets from the RNA-Puzzles experiments, the mean RMSD of the models predicted by trRosettaRNA is 5.5 [A], compared with 10.5 [A] from the state-of-the-art human group (i.e., Das). Further comparisons with two recently released deep learning-based methods (i.e., DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA) show that all three methods have similar accuracy. However, trRosettaRNA yields more accurate and physically more realistic side-chain atoms than DeepFoldRNA and RoseTTAFoldNA. Finally, we apply trRosettaRNA to predict the structures for the Rfam families that do not have known structures. Analysis shows that for 263 families, the predicted structure models are estimated to be accurate with RMSD < 4 [A].

    "abstract": "Due to high resolution and throughput of modern image cytometry platforms, morphologically profiling generated datasets poses a significant computational challenge. Here, we present Scalable Cytometry Image Processing (SCIP), an image processing software aimed at running on distributed high performance computing infrastructure. SCIP is scalable, flexible, open-source and enables reproducible image processing. It performs projection, illumination correction, segmentation, background masking and extensive morphological profiling on various imaging types.\n\nWe showcase SCIPs capabilities on three large-scale image cytometry datasets. First, we process an imaging flow cytometry (IFC) dataset of human white blood cells and show how the obtained features are used to classify cells into 8 cell types based on bright- and darkfield imagery. Secondly, we process an automated microscopy dataset of human white blood cells to divide them into cell types in an unsupervised manner. Finally, a high-content screening dataset of breast cancer cells is processed to predict the mechanism-of-action of a large set of compound treatments.\n\nThe software can be installed from the PyPi repository. Its source code is available at https://github.com/ScalableCytometryImageProcessing/SCIP under the GNU General Public License version 3. It has been tested on Unix operating systems. Issues with the software can be submitted at https://github.com/ScalableCytometryImageProcessing/SCIP/issues.\n\n1 Author SummaryCytometry is a field of biology that studies cells by measuring their characteristics. In image cytometry, this is done by acquiring images of cells. In order to gain biological insight from a set of images, an extensive amount of measurements are derived from them describing the cells they contain. These measurements include, for instance, a cells area, diameter, or the average brightness of the cell image. These measurements can then be analyzed using automated software tools to understand, for example, how cells respond to drug treatments, or how cells differ between a healthy and a diseased person. In this work, we present a novel software tool that is able to efficiently compute image measurements on large datasets of images. We do this by harnessing the power of high performance computing infrastructure. By enabling image cytometry researchers to make use of more computational power, they can more efficiently process complex and large datasets, paving the way to novel, fascinating biological discoveries.",

Such pooling may be particularly important in noisy settings where single neuron encoding is degraded. One example is the cocktail party problem, with competing sounds from multiple spatial locations. How populations of neurons in auditory cortex (ACx) code competing sounds have not been previously investigated. Here, we apply a novel information theoretic approach to estimate information in populations of neurons in ACx about competing sounds from multiple spatial locations, including both summed population (SP) and labeled line (LL) codes. We find that a small subset of neurons is sufficient to nearly maximize mutual information over different spatial configurations, with the LL code outperforming the SP code, and approaching information levels attained without noise. Moreover, with a LL code, units with diverse spatial responses, including both regular and narrow-spiking units, constitute the best pool. Finally, information in the population increases with spatial separation between target and masker, in correspondence with behavioral results on spatial release from masking in human and animals. Taken together, our results reveal that a compact and diverse population of neurons in ACx provide a robust code for competing sounds from different spatial locations.",

    "abstract": "The generation of antibody that binds to a specific conformational epitope of a target protein remains an outstanding challenge. We describe here a general approach to select and identify epitope-directed antibodies using a differential phage selection strategy. Prior to positive selection against protein of interest (POI), any binders that bind to undesired epitopes are depleted from the Fab phage library by a POI mutant with epitope of interest (EOI) mutated or blocked. As a proof-of-concept, we successfully developed highly specific antibodies targeting the proteolytic site on the CUB domain containing protein 1 (CDCP1) to block its proteolysis. We also generated antibodies recognizing the junction between the prodomain and catalytic domain of Matrix Metalloprotease 9 (MMP9) to block its maturation. Different from traditional MMP inhibitors targeting catalytic site, these potent MMP9 inhibitory antibodies are a novel class of MMP inhibitors with improved selectivity and stability. The inhibiting mechanism is unique among inhibitory antibodies and represents a new approach for developing molecules that inhibit therapeutic targets. These antibodies have shown promise in blocking metastasis of an invasive breast cancer cell line and are invaluable tools to assist the identification of MMP9 substrates by proteomics. We demonstrated the generality and versability of this approach by developing binders that block proteolytic activation of diverse protein targets with very distinct shapes and biological roles, including three MMPs (i.e., MMP1, MMP3, MMP10) and a cell surface receptor EPH Receptor A2 (EphA2). Our approach enables the generation of binders to the sites of interest on a wide variety of proteins for broad therapeutic and diagnostic applications.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in the inferotemporal (IT) cortex respond selectively to complex visual features, implying their role in object perception. However, perception is subjective and cannot be read out from neural responses; thus, bridging the causal gap between neural activity and perception demands independent characterization of perception. Historically though, the complexity of the perceptual alterations induced by artificial stimulation of IT cortex has rendered them impossible to quantify. Here we addressed this old problem by combining machine learning with high-throughput behavioral optogenetics in macaque monkeys. In closed-loop experiments, we generated complex and highly specific images that the animal could not discriminate from the state of being cortically stimulated. These images, named \"perceptograms\" for the first time, reveal and depict the contents of the complex hallucinatory percepts induced by local neural perturbation in IT cortex. Furthermore, we found that the nature and magnitude of these hallucinations highly depend on concurrent visual input, stimulation location, and intensity. Objective characterization of stimulation-induced perceptual events opens the door to developing a mechanistic theory of visual perception. Further, it enables us to make better visual prosthetic devices and gain a greater understanding of visual hallucinations in mental disorders.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryCombining state-of-the-art AI with high-throughput closed-loop brain stimulation experiments, for the first time, we took \"pictures\" of the complex and subjective visual hallucinations induced by local stimulation in the inferior temporal cortex, a cortical area associated with object recognition.",

    "abstract": "Neocortical layer 1 (L1) is a site of convergence between pyramidal neuron dendrites and feedback axons where local inhibitory signaling can profoundly shape cortical processing. Evolutionary expansion of human neocortex is marked by distinctive pyramidal neuron types with extensive branching in L1, but whether L1 interneurons are similarly diverse is underexplored. Using patch-seq recordings from human neurosurgically resected tissues, we identified four transcriptomically defined subclasses, unique subtypes within those subclasses and additional types with no mouse L1 homologue. Compared with mouse, human subclasses were more strongly distinct from each other across all modalities. Accompanied by higher neuron density and more variable cell sizes compared with mouse, these findings suggest L1 is an evolutionary hotspot, reflecting the increasing demands of regulating the expanding human neocortical circuit.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUsing transcriptomics and morpho-electric analyses, we describe innovations in human neocortical layer 1 interneurons.",

    "abstract": "Anthropogenic pressures have resulted in declines in diadromous fish. Many diadromous fish which were commercially important are now threatened and protected. Little is known about their marine life history phases, and no observation-based Species Distribution Model exists for this group of species at sea. Yet, fisheries dependent and independent data could provide new insights into the distribution of diadromous fish at sea.\n\nWe collated a database of 168 904 hauls from fisheries observer bycatch data and scientific fisheries surveys, from eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean waters. The distribution of eleven rare and data-poor diadromous fish (shads, lampreys, salmonids, the European eel, the thinlip mullet, smelt and the European flounder) were modelled. A Bayesian site occupancy model, that incorporates imperfect detection to account for repeat detections and non-detections, the non-random nature of fishing gear type and spatial autocorrelation was used. From the model outputs, we explored bycatch risk and the role of MPAs, required under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and Habitat Directive and assessed.\n\nDiadromous fish were observed within relatively shallow coastal areas. Species specific gear bycatch trends were observed. Core distribution areas corresponded to their known water basin presence, indicating connectivity with their freshwater habitats. Numerous Habitat Directive Marine Protected Areas were found to be of relevance.\n\nGiven the coastal distribution of these species, they are exposed to higher anthropogenic pressures from both terrestrial and marine environments. Risk of bycatch at sea for most species appears to be low. Nonetheless, for threatened individuals, even a small amount of bycatch may impact their populations, especially since misreporting is likely to be high. Differences in catchability between gears highlight potential benefits of limiting access of certain gears within protected areas to reduce bycatch.",

We integrated genome-wide association study (GWAS) data and uncovered a critical role for modulated SMC phenotypes in CAD and coronary calcification.

    "abstract": "Macaques provide the most widely used nonhuman primate models for studying immunology and pathogenesis of human diseases. While the macaque major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region shares most features with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, macaques have an expanded repertoire of MHC class I genes. Although a chimera of two rhesus macaque MHC haplotypes was first published in 2004, the structural diversity of MHC genomic organization in macaques remains poorly understood due to a lack of adequate genomic reference sequences. We used ultra-long Oxford Nanopore and high-accuracy PacBio HiFi sequences to fully assemble the [~]5.2 Mb M3 haplotype of an MHC-homozygous, Mauritian-origin cynomolgus macaque (Macaca fascicularis). The MHC homozygosity allowed us to assemble a single MHC haplotype unambiguously and avoid chimeric assemblies that hampered previous efforts to characterize this exceptionally complex genomic region in macaques. The high quality of this new assembly is exemplified by the identification of an extended cluster of six Mafa-AG genes that contains a recent duplication with a remarkably similar [~]48.5 kb block of sequence. The MHC class II region of this M3 haplotype is similar to the previously sequenced rhesus macaque haplotype and HLA class II haplotypes. The MHC class I region, in contrast, contains 13 MHC-B genes, four MHC-A genes, and three MHC-E genes (versus 19 MHC-B, two MHC-A, and one MHC-E in the previously sequenced haplotype). These results provide an unambiguously assembled single contiguous cynomolgus macaque MHC haplotype with fully curated gene annotations that will inform infectious disease and transplantation research.",

    "abstract": "Single neuron correlates of reward value have been observed in brain regions along the cortico-striatal pathway including ventral striatum, orbital, and medial prefrontal cortex. Brain imaging studies in humans further validate these findings and suggest that value is represented in a network of brain regions opposed to a particular area. Neural activity oscillates at periodic frequencies to coordinate long-range communication in widespread, dynamic networks. To explore how oscillatory dynamics across brain regions may represent reward value, we measured local field potentials of male Long-Evans rats during three distinct behavioral tasks, each probing a different aspect of reward processing. Our goal was to use a data-driven approach to identify a common electrophysiology property associated with reward value. We found that reward-locked oscillations at beta frequencies, in both single units and local field potentials, were markers of positive reward valence. More importantly, Reward-locked beta-oscillations scaled with expected reward value on specific trial types and in a behaviorally relevant way across tasks. Oscillatory signatures of reward processing were observed throughout the cortico-striatal network including electrodes placed in orbitofrontal cortex, anterior insula, medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and amygdala. These data suggests that beta-oscillations reflect learned reward value in a distributed network, and this may serve as a stable and robust bio-marker for future studies.",

Islet organoids (typically 100-200 m), which can be grown from the patients own cells, are emerging as prototypes for transplantation-based therapy of diabetes. Selective methods for quantifying insulin production from islet organoids are needed, but sensitivity and carry-over have been major bottlenecks in previous efforts. We have developed a reverse phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (RPLC-MS/MS) method for studying the insulin secretion of islet organoids. In contrast to our previous attempts using nano-scale LC columns, conventional 2.1 mm inner diameter LC column (combined with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry) was well suited for sensitive and selective measurements of insulin secreted from islet organoids with low microliter-scale samples. Insulin is highly prone to carry-over, so standard tubings and injector parts were replaced with shielded fused silica nanoViper connectors. As samples were expected to be very limited, an extended Box-Behnken experimental design for the MS settings was conducted to maximize performance. The finale method has excellent sensitivity, accuracy and precision (limit of detection: [&le;] 0.2 pg/L, relative error: [&le;] {+/-}10%, relative standard deviation: < 10%), and was well suited for measuring 20 L amounts of Krebs buffer containing insulin secreted from islet organoids.",

Here, using molecular dynamics, we investigated the effect of febrile temperatures (38{degrees}C to 40{degrees}C, 311K to 313K) on the immune complexes formed by the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with two neutralizing antibodies. We found that, at mild fever temperatures (311-312K), the binding affinities of the two antibodies improve when compared to the physiological body temperature (37{degrees}C, 310K). Furthermore, only at 312K, antibodies exert distinct mechanical effects on the receptor binding domains of the spike protein that may hinder SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Enhanced antibody binding affinity may thus be obtained using appropriate temperature conditions.",

Controlling cell shapes and quantifying the force-driven dynamic reciprocal interactions in a label-free setting is vital to understand cell behavior in fibrous environments but currently unavailable. Here, we introduce a force measurement platform termed crosshatch nanonet force microscopy (cNFM) that reveals new insights into cell shape-force coupling. Using a suspended crosshatch network of fibers capable of recovering in vivo cell shapes, we utilize deep learning methods to circumvent the fiduciary fluorescent markers required to recognize fiber intersections. Our method provides high fidelity computer reconstruction of different fiber architectures by automatically translating phase-contrast time-lapse images into synthetic fluorescent images. An inverse problem based on the nonlinear mechanics of fiber networks is formulated to match the network deformation and deformed fiber shapes to estimate the forces. We reveal an order-of-magnitude force changes associated with cell shape changes during migration, forces during cell-cell interactions and force changes as single mesenchymal stem cells undergo differentiation. Overall, deep learning methods are employed in detecting and tracking highly compliant backgrounds to develop an automatic and label-free force measurement platform to describe cell shape-force coupling in fibrous environments that cells would likely interact with in vivo.",

    "abstract": "When analysing transcriptome data, threshold values are chosen to decide whether the regulation of a gene is relevant or not, however this may result in the loss of valuable information. To overcome this problem it can be useful to analyse regulons instead of individual genes, to harness the statistical power of combining genes. Another advantage of a regulon-based analysis is that it provides direct insights into the activity of regulatory pathways, which is the essence of transcriptome analyses. We have developed a software tool called GINtool that can use regulon information to analyse transcriptome data. GINtool includes the option to take the activity mode of a regulator in account, which is important when a regulator can function both as an activator and repressor. GINtool also contains two novel graphical representations that greatly facilitate the visual inspection of regulon-based transcriptome analyses. Additional features of GINtool includes the evaluation of transcriptome data using functional categories, and the analysis of gene expression differences within operons. To ease the analyses and downstream processing of figures, GINtool has been developed as an add-in for Excel.",

    "abstract": "Transcription and co-transcriptional processes, including pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation, regulate the production of mature mRNAs. The carboxyl terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase (pol) II, which comprises 52 repeats of the Tyr1Ser2Pro3Thr4Ser5Pro6Ser7 peptide, is involved in the coordination of transcription with co-transcriptional processes. The pol II CTD is dynamically modified by protein phosphorylation, which regulates recruitment of transcription and co-transcriptional factors. We have investigated whether cytoplasmic levels of mature mRNA from intron-containing protein-coding genes are related to pol II CTD phosphorylation, RNA stability, and pre-mRNA splicing and mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation efficiency. We find that genes that produce a low level of mature mRNA are associated with relatively high phosphorylation of the pol II CTD Tyr1 and Thr4 residues, poor RNA processing, increased chromatin retention, and shorter RNA half-life. While these poorly-processed transcripts are degraded by the nuclear RNA exosome, our results indicate that in addition to RNA half-life, chromatin retention due to a low RNA processing efficiency also plays an important role in the regulation of cytoplasmic mRNA levels.",

    "abstract": "Physical exercise has been positioned as a promising strategy to prevent and/or alleviate anxiety and depression, but the mechanisms underlying its effects on mental health have yet to be entirely determined. Although the prevalence of depression and anxiety in women is about twice that of men, very few studies have examined whether physical exercise could affect mental health differently according to sex. This study examined, in mice, the sex-specific effects of voluntary exercise on body weight, depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, as well as different markers along the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis. Male and female C57BL/6N mice had voluntary access to running wheels in their home-cages for 24 days or were left undisturbed in identical home-cages without running wheels. Behaviors were then examined in the open field, Splash, elevated plus maze, and tail suspension tests. Gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, microglia activation-related genes, and tight junction proteins was determined in the jejunum and the hippocampus, while microbiota composition and predicted function were verified in cecum contents. Voluntary exercise limited weight gains, reduced anxiety-like behaviors, and altered grooming patterns in males exclusively. Although the exercise intervention resulted in changes to brain inflammatory activity and to cecal microbiota composition and inferred function in both sexes, reductions in the jejunal expression of pro-inflammatory markers were observed in females only. These findings support the view that voluntary exercise, even when performed during a short period, is beneficial for mental and intestinal health and that its sex-specific effects on behavior could be, at least in part, mediated by the gut microbiota-immune-brain axis.",

    "abstract": "Deficits in spatial navigation are among the early symptoms in Alzheimers disease patients, consistent with the hippocampal formation as the site for spatial computations and disease onset. Although the correspondence between the early symptoms and brain regions that are affected early in the disease has been recognized, it is not clear whether progressive cognitive decline is solely caused by a spreading pathology or whether a focal pathology can by itself cause aberrant neuronal activity in a larger network. These possibilities cannot be distinguished in standard disease models which broadly express APP across brain regions. We therefore generated a mouse model in which the expression of mutant human APP was limited to hippocampal CA3 cells (CA3-APP mice). We first asked whether the limited pathology in CA3 can result in memory deficits and found impaired performance of CA3-APP mice in a hippocampus-dependent memory task. By then recording in the CA1 region, we asked to what extent neuronal activity patterns emerged in a brain region which received projections from APP-expressing CA3 cells, but did itself not show any primary pathology. While the spatial firing patterns of CA1 cells were preserved, we observed a reduced theta oscillation frequency in the local field potential and in a subpopulation of principal cells in CA1. Furthermore, CA1 interneurons showed decreased theta oscillation frequencies, and this effect was even more pronounced in CA3 interneurons, which also do not directly express APP. Pathology that is highly localized and limited to presynaptic cells is thus sufficient to cause aberrant firing patterns in postsynaptic neuronal networks, which indicates that disease progression is not only from a spreading molecular pathology but also mediated by progressive physiological dysfunction.",

    "abstract": "Inferences about the taste of foods are a key aspect of our everyday experience of food choice. Despite this, gustatory mental imagery is a relatively under-studied aspect of our mental lives. In the present study, we examined subjects during high-field fMRI as they actively imagined basic tastes and subsequently viewed pictures of foods dominant in those specific taste qualities. Imagined tastes elicited activity in the bilateral dorsal mid-insula, one of the primary cortical regions responsive to the experience of taste. In addition, within this region we reliably decoded imagined tastes according to their dominant quality - sweet, sour, or salty - thus indicating that, like actual taste, imagined taste activates distinct quality-specific neural patterns. Using a cross-task decoding analysis, we found that the neural patterns for imagined tastes and food pictures in the mid-insula were reliably similar and quality-specific, suggesting a common code for representing taste quality regardless of whether explicitly imagined or automatically inferred when viewing food. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of mental imagery and the multimodal nature of presumably primary sensory brain regions like the dorsal mid-insula.",

Carnivorous sundews, the plant genus Drosera L., exhibit single chromosome number variation among and within species, especially in the Australian Drosera subg.

We reviewed literature, verified chromosome counts, and using an rbcL chronogram, tested alternate models where the gain, loss, and doubling rates (+1, -1, x2) were the same or different between D. subg. Ergaleium and the other subgenera. Ancestral chromosome number estimations were performed, and the distributions of self-compatibility and genome size were visualized across the genus. The best model for chromosome evolution had equal rates of polyploidy (0.014 per million years; Myr) but higher rates of single chromosome number gain (0.19 and 0.027 per Myr) and loss (0.23 and 0.00059 per Myr) in D. subg. Ergaleium compared to the other subgenera. We found no evidence for differences in single chromosome evolution to be due to differences in diploidization after polyploidy or to holocentromeres as had been proposed.

    "abstract": "Mutations can have deleterious fitness effects when they decrease protein specific activity or decrease active protein abundance. Mutations will also be deleterious when they cause misfolding or misinteractions that are toxic to the cell (i.e., independent of whether the mutations affect specific activity and abundance). The extent to which protein evolution is shaped by these and other collateral fitness effects is unclear in part because little is known of their frequency and magnitude. Using deep mutational scanning (DMS), we previously found at least 42% of missense mutations in the TEM-1 {beta}-lactamase antibiotic resistance gene cause deleterious collateral fitness effects. Here, we used DMS to comprehensively determine the collateral fitness effects of missense mutations in three genes encoding the antibiotic resistance proteins New Delhi metallo-{beta}-lactamase (NDM-1), chloramphenicol acetyltransferase I (CAT-I), and 2\"-aminoglycoside nucleotidyltransferase (AadB). AadB (20%), CAT-I (0.9%), and NDM-1 (0.2%) were less susceptible to deleterious collateral fitness effects than TEM-1 (42%) indicating that genes have different propensities for these effects. As was observed with TEM-1, all the studied deleterious aadB mutants increased aggregation. However, aggregation did not correlate with collateral fitness effects for many of the deleterious mutants of CAT-I and NDM-1. Select deleterious mutants caused unexpected phenotypes to emerge. The introduction of internal start codons in CAT-1 caused loss of the episome and a mutation in aadB made its cognate antibiotic essential for growth. Our study illustrates how the complexity of the cell provides a rich environment for collateral fitness effects and new phenotypes to emerge.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations in human cells have a highly heterogeneous genomic distribution, with increased burden in late-replication time (RT), heterochromatic domains of chromosomes. This regional mutation density (RMD) landscape is known to vary between cancer types, in association with tissue-specific RT or chromatin organization. Here, we hypothesized that regional mutation rates additionally vary between individual tumors in a manner independent of cell type, and that recurrent alterations in DNA replication programs and/or chromatin organization may underlie this. Here, we identified various RMD signatures that describe a global genome-wide mutation redistribution across many megabase-sized domains in >4000 tumors. We identified two novel global RMD signatures of somatic mutation landscapes that were universally observed across various cancer types. First, we identified a mutation rate redistribution preferentially affecting facultative heterochromatin, Polycomb-marked domains, and enriched in subtelomeric regions. This RMD signature strongly reflects regional plasticity in DNA replication time and in heterochromatin domains observed across tumors and cultured cells, which was linked with a stem-like phenotype and a higher expression of cell cycle genes. Consistently, occurrence of this global mutation pattern in cancers is associated with altered cell cycle control via loss of activity of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene. Second, we identified another independant global RMD signature associated with loss-of-function of the TP53 pathway, mainly affecting the redistribution of mutation rates away from late RT regions. The local mutation supply towards 26%-75% cancer driver genes is altered in the tumors affected by the global RMD signatures detected herein, including additionally a known pattern of a general loss of mutation rate heterogeneity due to DNA repair failures that we quantify. Our study highlights that somatic mutation rates at the domain scale are variable across tumors in a manner associated with loss of cell cycle control via RB1 or TP53, which may trigger the local remodeling of chromatin state and the RT program in cancers.",

    "abstract": "Accurate species identification and abundance estimation are critical for the interpretation of whole metagenome shotgun sequencing (WMS) data. Numerous computational methods, broadly referred to as metagenomic profilers, have been developed to identify species in microbiome samples by classification of sequencing reads and quantification of their relative abundances. Yet, existing metagenomic profilers typically suffer from false positive identifications and consequently biased relative abundance estimation (as false positives can be accounted for more than 90% of total identified species). Here, we present a new metagenomic profiler MAP2B (MetAgenomic Profiler based on type IIB restriction site) to resolve those issues. We first illustrate the pitfalls of using relative abundance as the only feature in determining false positives. We then propose a feature set to distinguish false positives from true positives. By benchmarking the performance in metagenomic profiling using data from CAMI2 (Critical Assessment of Metagenome Interpretation: second round of challenge), we illustrate the superior performance of MAP2B (F1 score ~ 0.93) over existing metagenomic profilers (F1 score ranges from 0.18 to 0.58). We further tested the performance of MAP2B using real WMS data from an ATCC mock community, confirming its superior performance and robustness against sequencing depth. In addition, by leveraging WMS data from an IBD cohort, we demonstrate the taxonomic features obtained by MAP2B can better discriminate disease status and predict metabolomic profiles.",

    "abstract": "Drug discovery uses high throughput screening to identify compounds that interact with a molecular target or that alter a phenotype favorably. The cautious selection of molecules used for such a screening is instrumental, and is tightly related to the hit rate. In this work, we wondered if Cell Painting, a general purpose image-based assay, could be used as an efficient proxy for compound selection, thus increasing the success rate of a specific assay. To this end, we considered Cell Painting images with 30,000 molecules treatments, and selected compounds that produced a visual effect close to the positive control of an assay, by using the Frechet Inception Distance. We then compared the hit rates of such a preselection with what was actually obtained in real screening campaigns. As a result, Cell Painting would have permitted a significant increase in the success rate and, even for one of the assays, would have allowed to reach 80% of the hits with ten times fewer compounds to test. We conclude that images of a Cell Painting assay can be directly used for compound selection prior to screening, and we provide a simple quantitative approach in order to do so.",

In this study we develop a genetic ancestry pipeline for the Cancer Genomics Cloud, which we use to assess the diversity of models currently available in the National Cancer Institute (NCI) supported PDX Development and Trial Centers Research Network (PDXNet). We show that there is an over-representation of models derived from patients of European ancestry, which is consistent with other cancer model resources. We discuss these findings in the context of disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes among demographic groups in the US. For example, for the top cancer health disparities affecting African Americans and Latinos, there is a significant lack of ethnic/race appropriate models needed to advance pre-clinical research and personalized clinical treatment. For stomach and liver tumors, which represent disparities in these two minority populations, there are only three available models derived from patients from such backgrounds. Fortunately, ongoing NCI-funded efforts in minority focused PDXNet centers are actively addressing these gaps. We further discuss these results in the context of power analyses to highlight the immediate need for the development of models from minority populations to address cancer health equity in personalized medicine.",

    "abstract": "The skeletal muscle research field generally accepts that nuclei in skeletal muscle fibers (i.e., myonuclei) are post-mitotic and unable to proliferate. Because our deuterium oxide (D2O) labeling studies showed DNA synthesis in skeletal muscle tissue, we hypothesized that resident myonuclei can replicate in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we used a mouse model that temporally labeled myonuclei with GFP followed by D2O labeling during normal cage activity, functional overload, and with satellite cell ablation. During normal cage activity, we observed deuterium enrichment into myonuclear DNA in 7 out of 7 plantaris (PLA), 6 out of 6 tibialis anterior (TA), 5 out of 7 gastrocnemius (GAST) and 7 out of 7 quadriceps (QUAD). The average fractional synthesis rates (FSR) of DNA in myonuclei were: 0.0202 {+/-} 0.0093 in PLA, 0.0239 {+/-} 0.0040 in TA, 0.0076 {+/-} 0. 0058 in GAST, and 0.0138 {+/-} 0.0039 in QUAD, while there was no replication in myonuclei from EDL. These FSR values were largely reproduced in the overload and satellite cell ablation conditions although there were higher synthesis rates in the overloaded PLA muscle. We further provided evidence that myonuclear replication is through endoreplication that results in polyploidy. These novel findings contradict the dogma that skeletal muscle nuclei are post-mitotic and open potential avenues to harness the intrinsic replicative ability of myonuclei for muscle maintenance and growth.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=141 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/513426v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e4d210org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19b52daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5c9a53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@197dc0d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Organ scanning is not a novel technology but the unique part of this study is to eliminate the need for expensive devices by using free iOS/Android applications. The apps allow users to create high-quality 3D models from photos taken with a phone or tablet. Metaverse and 3D digitization are the future of technology. Implementation of these approaches into the anatomy can change education style. Also, 3D printing technology along with the digitization of real-sized organs enables researchers and clinicians to study with 3D printed organs in class, even with augmented reality glasses. In this study, we first aimed to 3D digitized an animal organ with its real sizes to print in a 3D printer. Next, we wanted to digitize decellularized form of the organ, which suggests researchers study extracellular matrix and vascularization. This digitization of the different organ forms can improve the progression of artificial organ studies. Free and easy-to-use iOS or Android applications for 3D digitization enable medical students to study not only animal organs but cadavers. Hereby, we are suggesting organ scanning can be done on a daily basis in a standard laboratory. It is aimed to enable medical students to work effectively in anatomy lessons in Metaverse or in real cases, thanks to the anatomical library created with the accessibility brought by easy usability.",

    "abstract": "Loss of function (LoF) of Tar-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and mislocalization, together with TDP-43-positive and hyperphosphorylated inclusions, are found in postmortem tissue of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients, including those carrying LoF variants in the progranulin gene (GRN). Modelling TDP-43 pathology has been challenging in vivo and in vitro. We present a 3D-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived paradigm - mature brain organoids (mbOrg) - composed of cortical-like-astrocytes (iA) and neurons (iN). When devoid of GRN, mbOrgs spontaneously recapitulate TDP-43 mislocalization, hyperphosphorylation and LoF phenotypes.

We tested the effects of visual stimuli on the behavior of the nudibranch Berghia stephanieae under different food and hunger conditions. In an arena that was half shaded, animals spent most of their time in the dark, where they also decreased their speed and made more changes in heading. These behavioral differences between the light and dark were less evident in uniformly illuminated or darkened arenas, suggesting that they were not caused by the level of illumination. Berghia responded to distant visual targets; animals approached a stripe that was at least 15{degrees} wide and 50% darker than the background. They did not approach a stripe that was lighter than the background but approached a stripe that was isoluminant with the background, suggesting the detection of spatial information. Animals travelled in convoluted paths in a featureless arena but straightened their paths when a visual target was present even if they did not approach it, suggesting that visual cues were used for navigation. Individuals were less responsive to visual stimuli when food-deprived or in the presence of a food odor. Furthermore, when given a food odor, they had a weaker preference for the dark and behaved similarly in the light and dark. Thus, Berghia exhibits visually-guided behaviors that are influenced by odors and hunger state.\n\nSummary statementBehavioral analyses demonstrate that the nudibranch Berghia stephanieae is capable of spatial vision and has visually-guided behaviors that are influenced by olfactory information and hunger state.",

Studies have reported bacterial integrations in cancer patients, and microbial sequences have been detected in data from well-known Human sequencing projects. Few of the existing tools to investigate HGT are highly automated. Thanks to the adoption of Nextflow for life sciences work-flows, and the standards and best practices curated by communities such as nf-core, fully automated, portable, and scalable pipelines can now be developed. Here we present nf-core/hgtseq, to facilitate the analysis of HGT from sequencing data in different organisms. We showcase its performance by analysing six exome datasets from five mammals. Hgtseq can be run seamlessly in any computing environment and accepts data generated by existing exome and whole-genome sequencing projects: this will enable researchers to expand their analyses into this area. Fundamental questions are still open, about the mechanisms and the extent or the role of horizontal gene transfer: by releasing hgtseq we provide a standardised tool which will enable a systematic investigation of this phenomenon, thus paving the way for a better understanding of HGT.",

    "abstract": "Commercial and recreational stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) fisheries primarily occur along the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts of the southeastern United States and the northeastern Caribbean. The fishery is unique in that only the crabs claws are retained and the animal is returned to the water alive. While the fishery is often regarded as sustainable because it is believed to exploit the crabs natural ability to voluntarily drop (autotomize) and regenerate lost claws, the post-release survival of de-clawed stone crabs is often low, especially when both claws are harvested. In this study, a controlled laboratory experiment was used to compare a new method of claw removal to the typical method currently used in the fishery. For the two different claw removal methods, we compared crab survival and start time to claw regeneration as a function of harvester and whether one claw or both claws were removed. Overall, we found a significant effect of the removal method, harvester, and whether one claw or both claws were removed on crab survival, but these factors did not influence the time to start of claw regeneration. Although our new method was several seconds slower in processing time than the typical method, it resulted in a 28% increase in survival (up to 92% survival throughout the study) compared to the typical method of claw removal (64% survival throughout the study). Overall, these results suggest that our new method of claw removal significantly increases post-release survival of stone crabs, and most notably does so independent of harvester and whether one claw or both claws are removed.",

In each of these fields, the development of model systems with varied and tuneable material properties is of great importance for replicating properties of life. Here, we develop a ligase ribozyme system capable of concatenating short RNA fragments into extremely long chains. Our results show that formation of coacervate microdroplets with the ligase ribozyme and poly(L-lysine) enhances ribozyme rate and yield, which in turn increases the length of the anionic polymer component of the system and imparts specific physical properties to the droplets. Droplets containing active ribozyme sequences resist growth, do not wet or spread on unpassivated surfaces, and exhibit reduced transfer of RNA between droplets when compared to controls containing inactive sequences. These altered behaviours, which stem from RNA sequence and catalytic activity, constitute a specific phenotype and potential fitness advantage, opening the door to selection and evolution experiments based on a genotype - phenotype linkage.",

    "abstract": "Damage-Regulated Autophagy Modulator 1 (DRAM1) is an infection-inducible membrane protein, whose function in the immune response is incompletely understood. Based on previous results in a zebrafish infection model, we have proposed that DRAM1 is a host resistance factor against intracellular mycobacterial infection. To gain insight into the cellular processes underlying DRAM1-mediated host defence, here we studied the interaction of DRAM1 with Mycobacterium marinum in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. We found that shortly after phagocytosis, DRAM1 localised in a punctate pattern to mycobacteria, which gradually progressed to full DRAM1 envelopment of the bacteria. Within the same time frame, DRAM1-positive mycobacteria colocalised with the LC3 marker for autophagosomes and LysoTracker and LAMP1 markers for (endo)lysosomes. Knockdown analysis revealed that DRAM1 is required for recruitment of LC3 and for acidification of mycobacteria-containing vesicles. A reduction in the presence of LAMP1 further suggested reduced fusion of lysosomes with mycobacteria-containing vesicles. Finally, we show that DRAM1 knockdown impairs the ability of macrophages to control mycobacterial infection. Together, these results support that DRAM1 promotes the trafficking of mycobacteria through the degradative (auto)phagolysosomal pathway. Considering its prominent effect on host resistance to intracellular infection, DRAM1 is a promising target for therapeutic modulation of the microbicidal capacity of macrophages.",

Using LIPSTIC (Labeling Immune Partnerships by SorTagging Intercellular Contacts)-based single-cell transcriptomics, we identify individual DCs capable of presenting antigen to CD4+ T cells in the tdLN. These represent a small fraction of all DCs present in the tdLN and display a distinctive activated phenotype that includes production of cytokine IL-27, required for efficient T cell priming and tumor rejection. Tumor progression results in loss of effective priming of naive CD4+ T cells, downstream of transcriptional changes in DCs that are manifested already when they arrive at the tdLN.

    "abstract": "This study provides evidence on the molecular mechanisms by which P2RX7 signaling promotes the differentiation of Th1 cells. In vivo analysis was performed in the Plasmodium chabaudi model of malaria in view of the great relevance of this infectious disease for human health, as well as the great availability of data concerning Th1/Tfh differentiation. We show that P2RX7 induces T-bet expression and aerobic glycolysis in splenic CD4+ T cells that respond to malaria, at a time prior to Th1/Tfh polarization. Cell-intrinsic P2RX7 signaling sustains the glycolytic pathway and causes bioenergetic mitochondrial stress in activated CD4+ T cells. We also show in vitro the phenotypic similarities of Th1-conditioned CD4+ T cells that do not express P2RX7 and those in which the glycolytic pathway is pharmacologically inhibited. In addition, in vitro ATP synthase blockade and the consequent inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation, which drives cellular metabolism for aerobic glycolysis, is sufficient to promote rapid CD4+ T cell proliferation and polarization to the Th1 profile in the absence of P2RX7. These data demonstrate that P2RX7-mediated metabolic reprograming for aerobic glycolysis is a key event for Th1 differentiation and suggest that ATP synthase inhibition is a downstream effect of P2RX7 signaling that potentiates the Th1 response.",

    "abstract": "The microbiome is an underappreciated contributor to intestinal drug metabolism with broad implications for drug efficacy and toxicity. While considerable progress has been made towards identifying the gut bacterial genes and enzymes involved, the role of environmental factors in shaping their activity remains poorly understood. Here, we focus on the gut bacterial reduction of azo bonds (R-N=N-R), found in diverse chemicals in both food and drugs. Surprisingly, the canonical azoR gene in Escherichia coli was dispensable for azo bond reduction. Instead, azo reductase activity was controlled by the fumarate and nitrate reduction (fnr) regulator, consistent with a requirement for the anoxic conditions found within the gastrointestinal tract. Paired transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the fnr regulon revealed that in addition to altering the expression of multiple reductases, FNR is necessary for the metabolism of L-Cysteine to hydrogen sulfide, enabling the degradation of azo bonds. Taken together, these results show how gut bacteria sense and respond to their intestinal environment to enable the metabolism of chemical motifs found in both dietary and pharmaceutical compounds.\n\nIMPORTANCEThis work has broad relevance due to the ubiquity of dyes containing azo bonds in food and drugs. We report that azo dyes can be degraded by human gut bacteria through both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms, even from a single gut bacterial species. Furthermore, we revealed that environmental factors, oxygen and cysteine, control the ability of E. coli to degrade azo dyes due to their impacts on bacterial transcription and metabolism. These results open up new opportunities to manipulate the azoreductase activity of the gut microbiome through the manipulation of host diet, suggest that azoreductase potential may be altered in patients suffering from gastrointestinal disease, and highlight the importance of studying bacterial enzymes for drug metabolism in their natural cellular and ecological context.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study is characterization of the genomic and metabolic properties of a novel Lb. fermentum strain AGA52 which was isolated from a lactic acid fermented beverage called \"Shalgam\". The genome size of AGA52 was 2,001,084 bp, which is predicted to carry 2,024 genes, including 50 tRNAs, 3 rRNAs, 3ncRNAs, 15 CRISPR repeats, 14 CRISPR spacers, and 1 CRISPR array. The genome has a GC content of 51.82% including 95 predicted pseudogenes, 56 complete or partial transposases and 2 intact prophages. The similarity of the clusters of orthologous groups (COG) was analysed by comparison with the other Lb. fermentum strains. The detected resistome on the genome of AGA52 was found to be intrinsically originated. Based on genome analyses many CAZYmes were identified that are responsible for carbohydrate degradation and adaptation to gastrointestinal conditions. Besides, it has been determined that AGA52 has an obligate heterofermentative carbohydrate metabolism due to the absence of the 1-phosphofructokinase (pfK) enzyme. Additionally, it is determined that the strain has a higher antioxidant capacity and is adaptable to gastrointestinal simulated environments. It was also observed that the AGA52 has antimicrobial activity against Y. Enterocolitica ATCC9610, B. cereus ATCC33019, S. enterica sv. Typhimurium, E.coli O157:h7 ATCC43897, L.monocytogenes ATCC7644, K.pneumoniae ATCC13883, and P. vulgaris ATCC8427. Cholesterol assimilation (33.9{+/-}0.005%) and GABA production capacities were also confirmed by \"in silico\" and \"in vitro\". Overall, investigation of genomic and metabolic features of the AGA52 revealed that is a potential psychobiotic and probiotic dietary supplement candidate and can bring functional benefits to the host.",

    "abstract": "Fungi often adapt to environmental stress by altering their size, shape, or rate of cell division. These morphological changes require reorganization of the cell wall, a structural feature external to the cell membrane composed of highly interconnected polysaccharides and glycoproteins. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are copper-dependent enzymes that are typically secreted into the extracellular space to catalyze initial oxidative steps in the degradation of complex biopolymers such as chitin and cellulose. However, their roles in modifying endogenous microbial carbohydrates are poorly characterized. The CEL1 gene in the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn) is predicted by sequence homology to encode an LPMO of the AA9 enzyme family. The CEL1 gene is induced by host physiological pH and temperature, and it is primarily localized to the fungal cell wall. Targeted mutation of the CEL1 gene revealed that it is required for the expression of stress response phenotypes, including thermotolerance, cell wall integrity, and efficient cell cycle progression. Accordingly, a cel1{Delta} deletion mutant was avirulent in two models of C. neoformans infection. Therefore, in contrast to LPMO activity in other microorganisms that primarily targets exogenous polysaccharides, these data suggest that CnCel1 promotes intrinsic fungal cell wall remodeling events required for efficient adaptation to the host environment.\n\nAuthor summaryFungi need to adapt quickly to environmental stresses to thrive. The fungal cell wall, which supplies support and integrity to the cell, is an essential compartment to react and interact with the surrounding environment. Rapid changes within the carbohydrate composition and architecture occur in response to environmental stresses. Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are mononuclear copper-enzymes, secreted by microbes to assist in the first steps of remodeling and degrading complex and recalcitrant carbohydrates. In this study we explore the role of the putative AA9 family LPMO CnCel1 for growth and virulence of the fungal human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. The CEL1 gene is highly up-regulated in presence of host stresses and a cel1{Delta} mutant strain is avirulent in a murine model of infection. Downstream analysis of virulence-associated phenotypes identified the CEL1 gene to be required for thermotolerance as well as cell wall integrity, and efficient cell cycle progression in presence of host-mimicking stresses. Based upon those findings we propose that CnCel1 likely promotes intrinsic fungal cell wall remodeling events essential for adaptation to the host environment.",

    "abstract": "Hortaea werneckii is a black yeast with a remarkable tolerance to salt. Most studies have been dedicated to understanding how H. werneckii adapt to hypersaline environments. H. werneckii has an unconventional cell cycle in which it alternates between fission and budding, which is modulated by cell density. Additionally, H. werneckii can cause superficial mycosis of the palm and sole of humans. Here, we determine the impact of salt concentration on the EXF-2000 strains cell division pattern and morphology. At low density and no salt, EXF-2000 primarily grows as pseudohyphae dividing mainly by septation. When grown in the presence of salt at a similar concentration to saltwater or hypersaline environments, we observe it grows by first by undergoing fission followed by budding at the poles. Then, we examined a collection of 16 isolates, including isolates from marine and hypersaline environments and isolates from patients. Isolates exhibit a wide diversity in colony shape and cellular morphology. The isolates grew as yeast, pseudohyphae, and true hyphae, indicating that isolates can exhibit various cell morphologies under similar environmental conditions. We used the insect larvae Galleria mellonella to determine the pathogenic potential of our isolates. We observe that only a subset of isolates can cause death in our model, and there was no correlation between H. werneckii morphology and capacity to cause disease. Taken together, H. werneckii genomic and phenotypic diversity can serve as a model to better understand how phenotypes and pathogenic potential evolve in environmental fungi.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division is a tightly regulated process that requires the formation of a dynamic multi-protein complex. In the Firmicutes phylum, GpsB is a membrane associated protein that coordinates peptidoglycan synthesis for cell growth and division. Although GpsB has been studied in several organisms, the structure, function, and interactome of Staphylococcus aureus GpsB is largely uncharacterized, despite being reported as uniquely essential for growth in this clinically relevant bacterium. To address this knowledge gap, we solved the crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of S. aureus GpsB. This structure reveals an atypical asymmetric dimer, and major conformational flexibility that can be mapped to a hinge region formed by a three-residue insertion exclusive to Staphylococci. When this three-residue insertion is excised, its thermal stability increases, and the mutant no longer produces a previously reported lethal phenotype when overexpressed in Bacillus subtilis. Furthermore, we provide the first biochemical, biophysical, and crystallographic evidence that the N-terminal domain of GpsB binds not only PBP4, but also FtsZ, through a conserved recognition motif located on their C-terminus, thus linking peptidoglycan synthesis with cell division. Taken together, the unique structure of S. aureus GpsB and its direct interaction with FtsZ/PBP4 provide deeper insight into the central role of GpsB in S. aureus cell division.",

    "abstract": "Powassan virus (POWV) is an emerging tick-borne flavivirus that causes neuroinvasive disease, including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis. Similar to other neuroinvasive flaviviruses, such as West Nile virus (WNV) and Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), POWV disease presentation is heterogeneous, and the factors influencing disease outcome are not fully understood. We used Collaborative Cross (CC) mice to assess the impact of host genetic factors on POWV pathogenesis. We infected a panel of Oas1b-null CC lines with POWV and observed a range of susceptibility phenotypes, indicating that host factors other than the well-characterized flavivirus restriction factor Oas1b modulate POWV pathogenesis in CC mice. Among Oas1b-null CC lines, we identified multiple highly susceptible lines (0% survival), including CC071, and a single resistant line (78% survival), CC045. Susceptibility phenotypes generally were concordant among neuroinvasive flaviviruses, although we identified one line, CC006, that was resistant specifically to JEV, suggesting that both pan-flavivirus and virus-specific mechanisms contribute to susceptibility phenotypes in CC mice. We found that POWV replicated to higher titers in bone marrow-derived macrophages from CC071 mice compared to CC045 mice, suggesting that resistance could result from cell-intrinsic restriction of viral replication. Although serum viral loads at 2 days post-infection were equivalent between CC071 and CC045 mice, clearance of POWV from the serum was significantly slower in CC071 mice. Furthermore, CC045 mice had significantly lower viral loads in the brain at 7 days post-infection compared to CC071 mice, suggesting that reduced CNS infection contributes to the resistant phenotype of CC045 mice.\n\nIMPORTANCENeuroinvasive flaviviruses, such as WNV, JEV, and POWV, are transmitted to humans by mosquitoes or ticks, can cause neurologic disease, such as encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis, and can result in death or long-term sequelae. Although potentially severe, neuroinvasive disease is a rare outcome of flavivirus infection. The factors that determine whether someone develops severe disease after flavivirus infection are not fully understood, but host genetic differences in polymorphic antiviral response genes likely contribute to disease outcome. We evaluated a panel of genetically diverse mice and identified lines with distinct outcomes following infection with POWV. We found that resistance to POWV pathogenesis corresponded to reduced viral replication in macrophages, more rapid clearance of virus in peripheral tissues, and reduced viral infection in the brain. These susceptible and resistant mouse lines will provide a system for investigating the pathogenic mechanisms of POWV and identifying polymorphic host genes that contribute to resistance.",

    "abstract": "Among Enterococci, intrinsic and acquired resistance to antibiotics such as {beta}-lactams and vancomycin critically limit treatment options for infection with these opportunistic pathogens. Antimicrobials that enhance the host immune response are emerging as alternative approaches, with the potential to overcome bacterial resistance. Here, we investigate the antibiotic and immunological activity of the anticancer agent mitoxantrone (MTX) in vitro and in vivo against vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We show that, in vitro, MTX is a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of ~1 g/ml through induction of reactive oxygen species and DNA damage. MTX synergises with vancomycin and lowers the vancomycin concentration required to kill VRE by over 140-fold. This synergy is specific to vancomycin-resistant, but not susceptible strains because vancomycin rendered the resistant strains more permeable to MTX and thus MTX-mediated DNA damage. In a murine wound infection model, MTX treatment effectively reduced VRE bacterial numbers by 120-fold and with further reduction when combined with vancomycin. Wounds treated with MTX had significantly higher numbers of macrophages and higher pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to untreated wounds. In addition, MTX augmented intracellular bacterial killing by both murine and human macrophages by upregulating the expression of lysosomal hydrolases cathepsins D and H, and {beta}-Hexosaminidase. These results show that MTX is a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria, synergizes with vancomycin, enhances macrophage recruitment and intracellular bactericidal activity, and represents a promising dual bacterium- and host-targeted therapeutic for overcoming vancomycin resistance.\n\nOne sentence summaryMitoxantrone synergizes with vancomycin against vancomycin resistant bacterial strains via direct antibiotic activity and by augmenting both host macrophage recruitment to the site of infection and macrophage bactericidal activity.",

    "abstract": "In vitro investigations of host-pathogen interactions of viruses are reliant on suitable cell and tissue culture models. Results are only as good as the model they have been generated in. However, choosing cell models for in vitro work often depends on what is available in labs or what has previously been used. Despite the vast increase in coronavirus research activity over the past few years, researchers are still heavily reliant on: non-human cells, for example Vero E6, highly heterogeneous or not fully differentiated cells, such as Calu-3, or naturally unsusceptible cells requiring overexpression of receptors and other accessory factors, such as ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Complex cell models, such as primary cell-derived air-liquid interface epithelial models are highly representative of human tissues but are expensive and time-consuming to develop and maintain. They have limited suitability for large-scale and high-throughput analysis.\n\nUsing tissue-specific expression pattern as a selection criteria, we identified human kidney cells as an ideal target for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and broader coronavirus infection. We show the use of the highly characterized human kidney cell line Caki-1 for infection with three human coronaviruses: Betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV-2 and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Alphacoronavirus human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E). Caki-1 cells show equal or superior susceptibility to all three coronaviruses when compared to other commonly used cell lines for the cultivation of the respective virus. Antibody staining against SARS-CoV-2 N protein shows comparable replication rates. Using a panel of 21 antibodies in infected Caki-1 cells using immunocytochemistry shows the location of viral proteins during replication. In addition, Caki-1 cells were found to be susceptible to two other human respiratory viruses, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus, making them an ideal model for cross-comparison of not only a broad range of coronaviruses but respiratory viruses in general.\n\nAuthor SummaryInvestigating how viruses interact with their host relies models used for laboratory research. The closer a model matches the host, the more conclusive results are. Complex cell systems based on primary epithelial or stem cells are the gold standard of in vitro research. However, they are expensive, time consuming, and laborious to establish. Therefore, cell lines remain the backbone of virus research.\n\nDespite vastly increased research into human coronaviruses following the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers continue to rely on suboptimal cell line models, for example ells of non-human origin like the VeroE6 African Green Monkey cell line. Using known expression patterns of the entry factors of the COVID-19 causative agent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) we identified the Caki-1 cell line as a target for SARS-CoV-2. This cell line could be shown to be infectable with a wide range of coronaviruses including common cold virus hCoV-229E, epidemic virus MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 as well as other important respiratory viruses influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus. We could show that SARS-CoV-2 proteins can be stained for and localized in Caki-1 cells and the cells are competent of forming a cellular immune response. Together, this makes Caki-1 cells a unique tool for cross-virus comparison in one cell line.",

The workflow encompasses semi-automated data analysis and enables de novo identification in complex media including human plasma, cancer cell lines and human sebaceous wax (i.e., vernix caseosa). The targeted analysis including ozonolysis enables structural assignment over a dynamic range of five orders of magnitude, even in instances of incomplete chromatographic separation. Thereby we expand the number of identified plasma fatty acids two-fold, including non-methylene interrupted fatty acids. Detection, without prior knowledge, allows discovery of non-canonical double bond positions. Changes in relative isomer abundances reflect underlying perturbations in lipid metabolism.",

However, how specific cofactors contribute to transactivation at different genes remains unclear. Here, we couple Gal4-transactivation assays with comparative CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify the cofactors required by nine different transcription factors and nine different core promoters in human cells. We classify cofactors as ubiquitous or specific, discover novel transcriptional co-dependencies and demonstrate that submodules within large co-activator complexes, such as the tail 2 and kinase modules of Mediator, facilitate transcriptional elongation. Rather than displaying discrete mechanisms of action, we discover that each TF requires a unique combination of cofactors, which influence its ability to potentiate distinct steps in the transcriptional process. Our findings help reconcile models of cofactor-promoter compatibility by demonstrating that transcription at different classes of promoters is constrained by either initiation or pause release. These differences dictate cofactor compatibility and the dynamic range of gene expression. Overall, our screens provide insight into TF-cofactor relationships and their ability to potentiate different steps in transcription at different classes of promoters.",

    "abstract": "Formation of tissue-specific transcriptional programs underlies multicellular development, but how the chromatin landscape influences transcription is not fully understood. Here we comprehensively resolve differential transcriptional and chromatin states during Drosophila dorsoventral (DV) patterning. We find that RNA Polymerase II pausing is established at DV promoters prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA), that pausing persists irrespective of cell fate, but that release into productive elongation is tightly regulated and accompanied by tissue-specific P-TEFb recruitment. DV enhancers acquire distinct tissue-specific chromatin states through CBP-mediated histone acetylation that predict the transcriptional output of target genes, whereas promoter states are more tissue invariant. Transcriptome-wide inference of burst kinetics in different cell types revealed that while DV genes are generally characterized by a high burst size, either burst size or frequency can differ between tissues. The data suggest that pausing is established by pioneer transcription factors prior to ZGA and that release from pausing is imparted by enhancer chromatin state to regulate bursting in a tissue-specific manner in the early embryo. Our results uncover how developmental patterning is orchestrated by tissue-specific bursts of transcription from Pol II primed promoters in response to enhancer regulatory cues.",

    "abstract": "Enhancers are essential in defining cell fates through the control of cell type specific gene expression. Enhancer activation is a multi-step process involving chromatin remodelers and histone modifiers including the monomethylation of H3K4 (H3K4me1) by MLL3 (KMT2C) and MLL4 (KMT2D). MLL3/4 are thought to be critical for enhancer activation and cognate gene expression including through the recruitment of acetyltransferases for H3K27. Here we test this model by evaluating the impact of MLL3/4 loss on chromatin and transcription during early embryonic stem cell differentiation. We find that MLL3/4 activity is required at most if not all sites that gain or lose H3K4me1 but is largely dispensable at sites that remain stably methylated during this transition. This requirement extends to H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) at most transitional sites. However, many sites gain H3K27ac independent of MLL3/4 or H3K4me1 including enhancers regulating key factors in early differentiation. Furthermore, despite the failure to gain active histone marks at thousands of enhancers, transcriptional activation of nearby genes is largely unaffected, thus uncoupling the regulation of these chromatin events from transcriptional changes during this transition. These data challenge current models of enhancer activation and imply distinct mechanisms between stable and dynamically changing enhancers. Collectively, our study highlights gaps in knowledge about the steps and epistatic relationships of enzymes necessary for enhancer activation and cognate gene transcription.",

    "abstract": "The envelope glycoprotein (Env) is the main focus of HIV-1 vaccine development due to its critical role in viral entry. Despite advances in protein engineering, many Env proteins remain recalcitrant to recombinant expression due to their inherent metastability, making biochemical and immunological experiments impractical or impossible. Here we report a novel proline-stabilization strategy to facilitate the production of prefusion Env trimers. This approach, termed \"2P\", works synergistically with previously described SOSIP mutations and dramatically increases the yield of recombinantly expressed Env ectodomains without altering the antigenic or conformational properties of native Env. We determined that the 2P mutations function by enhancing the durability of the prefusion conformation and that this stabilization strategy is broadly applicable to evolutionarily and antigenically diverse Envs. These findings provide a new Env stabilization platform to facilitate biochemical research and expand the number of Env variants that can be developed as future HIV-1 vaccine candidates.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in the human leucine rich repeat protein kinase-2 (LRRK2) create risk factors for Parkinsons Disease, and pathological functions of LRRK2 are often correlated with aberrant kinase activity. Past research has focused on developing selective LRRK2 kinase inhibitors. We showed previously that in addition to influencing intrinsic kinase activity, the global conformation of the LRRK2 protein plays a vital role in regulating LRRK2 signaling pathways. Deciphering the allosteric regulation in LRRK2 provides novel strategies for drug discovery. In this study, we combined enhanced sampling simulations with HDX-MS to analyze the inhibitor-induced dynamic changes and the allosteric communications in the C-terminal half of LRRK2, LRRK2RCKW. We find that a type I inhibitor (MLi-2) locks the kinase into a closed, active-like configuration, whereas a type II inhibitor (Rebastinib) shifts the kinase to an open, inactive configuration. While both type I and type II inhibitors reduce the kinase activity effectively, they have distinct effects on the LRRK2 conformational dynamics. Specifically, binding of MLi-2 stabilizes the kinase domain in a closed conformation and reduces the global dynamics of LRRK2RCKW, leading to a more compact LRRK2RCKW structure. In contrast, binding of Rebastinib stabilizes an open conformation where communication between the N- and C-lobe is severed, which promotes a more extended LRRK2RCKW structure. Rebastinib, based on HDX-MS, creates a more dynamic kinase domain especially at domain interfaces associated with the C-lobe. Our results also reveal the importance of the Dk-helix, which plays a crucial role in propagating communication between the kinase domain and the GTPase domain.",

Miro1 contains two GTPase domains, where changes in the N-terminal GTPase nucleotide state strongly affects mitochondrial trafficking. Previous work showed that the GTP-locked mutation Miro1P13V decreases trafficking and affects mitochondrial dynamics. Despite showing a clear role in Miro1 function, the molecular basis for this activity remains unknown. Using in vitro reconstitution, we demonstrate that Miro1 self-associates to form dimers and higher-ordered species. Structural characterization of Miro1P13V suggests that the oligomers adopt a range of conformations in vitro. Additionally, Miro1P13V has diminished interaction with its downstream cargo adapter TRAK1. These results indicate that the NGTPase of Miro1 facilitates the formation of higher-ordered species and suggests that changes in the oligomeric state may regulate mitochondrial trafficking through reduced association with TRAK1.",

    "abstract": "The proteasome holoenzyme is a complex molecular machine that degrades most proteins. In the proteasome holoenzyme, six distinct ATPase subunits (Rpt1 through Rpt6) enable protein degradation by injecting protein substrates into it. Individual Rpt subunits assemble into a heterohexameric \"Rpt ring\" in a stepwise manner, by binding to their cognate chaperones. Completion of the heterohexameric Rpt ring correlates with release of a specific chaperone, Nas2, however it is unclear whether and how this event may ensure proper Rpt ring assembly. Here, we examined the action of Nas2 by capturing the poorly characterized, penultimate step of heterohexameric Rpt ring assembly. We show that Nas2 uses steric hindrance to block premature progression of the penultimate step into the final step of Rpt ring assembly. Importantly, Nas2 can activate an assembly checkpoint via its steric activity, when the last ATPase subunit, Rpt1, cannot be added in a timely manner. This checkpoint can be relieved via Nas2 release, when it recognizes proper addition of Rpt1 to one side of its cognate Rpt5, and ATP hydrolysis by Rpt4 on the other side of Rpt5, allowing completion of Rpt ring assembly. Our findings reveal dual criteria for Nas2 release, as a mechanism to ensure both the composition and functional competence of a newly assembled proteasomal ATPase, to generate the proteasome holoenzyme.",

    "abstract": "Strigol was the first strigolactone (SL) to be discovered, but the biosynthetic pathway remains elusive. Here, through rapid gene screening using a microbial SL-producing platform, we functionally identified a strigol synthase (PpMAX1c, a cytochrome P450 711A enzyme) in Prunus that synthesizes strigol directly from the SL precursor carlactone through catalyzing multi-step oxidations and C-ring cyclization, bypassing the synthesis of 5-deoxystrigol. The function of PpMAX1c was validated through reconstructing the biosynthesis of strigol in Nicotiana benthamiana. Additional genomic analysis and functional verification confirm that peach also encodes an orobanchol synthase (PpCYP722C, a cytochrome P450 722C enzyme), which hints at the presence of both strigol-type and orobanchol-type SLs in peach and was confirmed through metabolic analysis of peach seedlings. This work highlights the catalytic diversity of the largely unexplored family of CYP711A homologs and sets the foundation to characterize the roles of different types of SLs in the economically important Prunus.",

Smooth landscapes arise when incremental mutational steps lead to a progressive change in function, as commonly seen in enzymes and binding proteins. On the other hand, rugged landscapes are poorly understood because of the inherent unpredictability of how sequence changes affect function. Here, we experimentally characterize the entire sequence phylogeny, comprising 1158 extant and ancestral sequences, of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) of the LacI/GalR transcriptional repressor family. Our analysis revealed an extremely rugged landscape with rapid switching of specificity even between adjacent nodes. Further, the ruggedness arises due to the necessity of the repressor to simultaneously evolve specificity for asymmetric operators and disfavors potentially adverse regulatory crosstalk. Our study provides fundamental insight into evolutionary, molecular, and biophysical rules of genetic regulation through the lens of fitness landscapes.",

    "abstract": "Performance during instrumental learning is commonly believed to reflect the knowledge that has been acquired up to that point. However, recent work in rodents found that instrumental performance was enhanced during periods when reinforcement was withheld, relative to periods when reinforcement was provided. This suggests that reinforcement may mask acquired knowledge and lead to impaired performance. In the present study, we investigated whether such a beneficial effect of removing reinforcement translates to humans. Specifically, we tested whether performance during learning was improved during non-reinforced relative to reinforced task periods using signal detection theory and a computational modelling approach. To this end, 60 healthy volunteers performed a novel visual go/no-go learning task with deterministic reinforcement. To probe acquired knowledge in the absence of reinforcement, we interspersed blocks without feedback. In these non-reinforced task blocks, we found an increased d, indicative of enhanced instrumental performance. However, computational modelling showed that this improvement in performance was not due to an increased sensitivity of decision making to learnt values, but to a more cautious mode of responding, as evidenced by a reduction of a general response bias. Together with an initial tendency to act, this is sufficient to drive differential changes in hit and false alarm rates that jointly lead to an increased d. To conclude, the improved instrumental performance in the absence of reinforcement observed in studies using asymmetrically reinforced go/no-go tasks may reflect a change in response bias rather than unmasking latent knowledge.\n\nAuthor SummaryIt appears plausible that we can only learn and improve if we are told what is right and wrong. But what if feedback overshadows our actual expertise? In many situations, people learn from immediate feedback on their choices, while the same choices are also used as a measure of their knowledge. This inevitably confounds learning and the read-out of learnt associations. Recently, it was suggested that rodents express their true knowledge of a task during periods when they are not rewarded or punished during learning. During these periods, animals displayed improved performance. We found a similar improvement of performance in the absence of feedback in human volunteers. Using a combination of computational modelling and a learning task in which humans performance was tested with and without feedback, we found that participants adjusted their response strategy. When feedback was not available, participants displayed a reduced propensity to act. Together with an asymmetric availability of information in the learning environment, this shift to a more cautious response mode was sufficient to yield improved performance. In contrast to the rodent study, our results do not suggest that feedback masks acquired knowledge. Instead, it supports a different mode of responding.",

Here, by utilizing longitudinal monitoring of C. elegans individuals throughout development we show that behavioral effects of early-life starvation are exposed during early and late developmental stages and buffered during intermediate stages of development. We further found that both dopamine and serotonin shape the discontinuous behavioral responses by opposite and temporally segregated functions across development time. While dopamine buffers behavioral responses during intermediate developmental stages, serotonin promotes behavioral sensitivity to stress during early and late stages. Interestingly, unsupervised analysis of individual biases across development uncovered multiple individuality types that coexist within stressed and unstressed populations and further identified experience-dependent effects on their composition. These results provide insight into the complex temporal regulation of behavioral plasticity across developmental timescales, structuring shared and unique individual responses to early-life experiences.",

    "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, affect males more than females. Genomic mechanisms enhancing risk in males may contribute to this sex-bias. The ubiquitin protein ligase E3A gene (Ube3a) exerts pleiotropic effects on cellular homeostasis via control of protein turnover and by acting as transcriptional coactivator with steroid hormone receptors. Overdosage of Ube3a via duplication or triplication of chromosomal region 15q11-13 causes 1-2% of autistic cases. Here, we test the hypothesis that increased dosage of Ube3a may influence autism-relevant phenotypes in a sex-biased manner. We report robust sex-biasing effects on brain connectomics and repetitive behaviors in mice with extra copies of Ube3a. These effects were associated with a profound transcriptional dysregulation of several known autism-associated genes (e.g., FMR1, SCN2A, PTEN, MEF2C, SHANK3, TSC2) as well as differentially-expressed genes identified in human 15q duplication and in autistic patients. Notably, increased Ube3a dosage also affects multiple sex-relevant mechanisms, including genes on the X chromosome, genes influenced by sex steroid hormones, downstream targets of the androgen and estrogen receptors, or genes that are sex-differentially regulated by transcription factors. These results suggest that Ube3a overdosage can critically contribute to sex-bias in neurodevelopmental conditions via influence on sex-differential mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Synucleinopathies such as Parkinsons disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy are characteristic for -synuclein aggregates in neurons or glia, and are always manifested olfaction deficits at their primary onsets. It remains elusive why aggregation of -synuclein predominantly affect the olfactory system. Employing the knockout mice, we investigate the physiological function of -synuclein in olfactory system. We found that deletion of -synuclein primarily interferes the projection of olfactory sensory neurons. iTRAQ based LC-MS identified that 188 proteins are differentially expressed, including 9 that were associated with axon guidance. Among them, NCK2 is most significantly down-regulated, which was indicated to be involved a PPI network of 21 proteins, including 11 players of the Ephrin receptor signaling pathway. Either -synuclein deletion or NCK2 deficiency can inactivate Eph A4 receptor. Re-expressing -synuclein in the -synuclein knockout neurons reverse the NCK2, as well as the phosphorylated Eph A4 (the activated Eph A4). Thus, -synuclein regulates axon guidance through NCK2-Eph A4 signaling pathway. Malfunction of -synuclein, whether because of deletion or aggregation, may cause aberrant olfactory neurons projection and subsequent olfaction deficits. This extended our knowledge of effects of -synuclein in olfactory system, which may explain why olfaction is usually impaired in some synucleinopathy related disorders such as Parkinsons disease.",

How these distinct processes are coordinated during signaling center development remains unknown. Here we show that Lmx1a acts as a master regulator to orchestrate the formation and function of the cortical hem (CH), a critical signaling center that controls hippocampus development. Lmx1a co-regulates CH induction, its Wnt signaling, and the differentiation and migration of CH-derived Cajal-Retzius neurons.

    "abstract": "Bees rely heavily on vision during most of their interaction with the environment, but so far, visual abilities have not been included into functional investigations of these crucial pollinators. This is probably due to the lack of comprehensive and phylogenetically-controlled quantification of visual traits across species. In the present study, we used high-throughput micro-CT tools to quantify, compare and understand the diversity of visual traits of compound eyes in bumblebees. Visual systems of bumblebees were far from identical, with variations across sizes, castes and species. While phylogenetic proximity poorly supported interspecific variations, these were better explained by two ecological factors: social parasitism and habitat. The eye parameter - a metric that measures the relative investment of a compound eye into resolution or sensitivity - was lower in queens of social parasitic species than of non-parasitic species. Workers of species associated with forested habitat had distinct visual traits, including a higher eye parameter, than those of species living in open landscapes. These diverse visual traits are likely to provide selective advantages to bumblebees given their specific ecological requirements. We thus propose that social parasitism and forest habitat are drivers of the diversification of compound eyes in bumblebees. Finally, we discuss how the present study can inspire trait-based approaches in ecology and conservation biology.",

    "abstract": "Our subjective sense of time is intertwined with a plethora of perceptual, cognitive, and motor functions, and likewise, the brain is equipped to expertly filter, weight, and combine these signals for seamless interactions with a dynamic world. Until relatively recently, the literature on time perception has excluded the influence of motor activity, yet, it has been found that motor circuits in the brain are at the core of most timing functions. Several studies have now identified that concurrent movements exert robust effects on perceptual timing estimates, but critically, have not assessed how humans consciously judge the duration of their own movements. This creates a gap in our understanding of the mechanisms driving movement-related effects on sensory timing. We sought to address this gap by administering a sensorimotor timing task in which we explicitly compared the timing of isolated auditory tones and arm movements, or both simultaneously. We contextualized our findings within a Bayesian cue combination framework, in which separate sources of temporal information are weighted by their reliability and integrated into a unitary time estimate that is more precise than either unisensory estimate. Our results revealed differences in accuracy between auditory, movement, and combined trials, and crucially, that combined trials were the most accurately timed. Under the Bayesian framework, we found that participants combined estimates were more precise than isolated estimates in a way that trended towards optimality, while being overall less optimal than the models prediction. These findings elucidate previously unknown qualities of conscious motor timing, and proposes computational mechanisms that can describe how movements combine with perceptual signals to create unified, multimodal experiences of time.",

    "abstract": "Neurocomputational accounts of psychosis propose mechanisms for how information is integrated into a predictive model of the world, in attempts to understand the occurrence of altered perceptual experiences. Conflicting Bayesian theories postulate aberrations in either top-down or bottom-up processing. The top-down theory predicts an overreliance on prior beliefs or expectations resulting in aberrant perceptual experiences, whereas the bottom-up theory predicts an overreliance on current sensory information, as aberrant salience is directed towards objectively uninformative stimuli. This study empirically adjudicates between these models. We use a perceptual decision-making task in a neurotypical population with varying degrees of psychotic-like experiences. Bayesian modelling was used to compute individuals reliance on prior relative to sensory information. Across two datasets (discovery dataset n=363; independent replication in validation dataset n=782) we showed that psychotic-like experiences were associated with an overweighting of sensory information relative to prior expectations, which seem to be driven by decreased precision afforded to prior information. However, when prior information was more uncertain, participants with greater psychotic-like experiences encoded sensory information with greater noise. Greater psychotic-like experiences were also associated with generally heightened perceptions of task instability, which we suggest may be the cause for the observed aberrant precision in the encoding both prior and likelihood information. Our study lends empirical support to notions of both weaker bottom-up and weaker (rather than stronger) top-down perceptual processes, as well as aberrancies in belief updating that extend into the non-clinical continuum of psychosis.",

    "abstract": "Controversy persists regarding the representation of negated actions, specifically concerning activation and inhibitory mechanisms in the motor system, and whether this occurs in one or two steps. We conducted two experiments probing corticospinal excitability (CSE) and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) in the primary motor cortex at different latencies while reading affirmative and negative action sentences.\n\nTwenty-six participants read action and non-action sentences in affirmative or negative forms. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation, we probed CSE in hand muscles at rest and at several latencies after verb presentation. We observed a greater CSE for action sentences compared to non-action sentences, regardless of verb form.\n\nIn experiment two, nineteen participants read affirmative and negative action sentences. We measured CSE and SICI at short and long latencies after verb presentation. CSE was greater for affirmative and negative action sentences at both latencies compared to rest. SICI did not change at the short latency but increased at longer latencies, regardless of verb form.\n\nOur results lend partial support for a two-step model, as negated actions showed the same motor excitability as affirmed actions with no additional inhibition at early latencies. Later neural differences between affirmative and negative actions may occur outside the primary motor cortex.\n\nSignificant statementIn two TMS experiments, we probed corticospinal excitability and short-interval intracortical inhibition in the primary motor cortex at different latencies while subjects read affirmative and negative action sentences. Consistent with an embodied view of language comprehension, our results demonstrate that reading about actions indeed activates the motor system, and this for both negative and affirmative sentences. Our results lend partial support for a two-step model of negation, as negated actions showed the same increase in motor excitability as affirmed actions, with no additional inhibition at early latencies. This suggests that the motor system contributes to comprehension by simulating the negated or affirmed action. Later neural differences between affirmative and negative actions may occur outside the primary motor cortex.",

    "abstract": "Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the fastest-growing classes of drugs and have been approved to treat several diseases, including cancers and autoimmune disorders. Preclinical pharmacokinetics studies are performed to determine the therapeutically meaningful dosages and efficacy of candidate drugs. These studies are typically performed in non-human primates; however, using primates is costly and raises ethical considerations. As a result, rodent models that better mimic human-like pharmacokinetics have been generated and remain an area of active investigation.\n\nPharmacokinetic characteristics of a candidate drug, such as half-life, are partly controlled by antibody binding to the human neonatal receptor hFCRN. Due to the abnormally high binding of human antibodies to mouse FCRN, traditional laboratory rodents do not accurately model the pharmacokinetics of human mAbs. In response, humanized rodents expressing hFCRN have been generated. However, these models generally use large inserts randomly integrated into the mouse genome. Here, we report the production and characterization of a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated hFCRN transgenic mouse termed SYNB-hFCRN. Using CRISPR/Cas9-assisted gene targeting, we prepared a strain with a simultaneous knockout of mFcrn and insertion of a hFCRN mini-gene under the control of the endogenous mouse promoter. These mice are healthy and express hFCRN in the appropriate tissues and immune cell subtypes. Pharmacokinetic evaluation of human IgG and adalimumab (Humira(R)) demonstrate hFCRN- mediated protection. These newly generated SYNB-hFCRN mice provide another valuable animal model for use in preclinical pharmacokinetics studies during early drug development.\n\nMaterials availabilityCryopreserved germline cells from the strains are available from the MMRRC.

To aid in the characterization of pleiotropic biological functions of CTB and its variants, we generated a panel of anti-CTB monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). By ELISA and surface plasmon resonance, two mAbs, 7A12B3 and 9F9C7, were analyzed for their binding affinities to cholera holotoxin (CTX), CTB, and EPICERTIN: a recombinant CTB variant possessing mucosal healing activity. Both 7A12B3 and 9F9C7 bound efficiently to CTX, CTB, and EPICERTIN with equilibrium dissociation constants at low to sub-nanomolar concentrations but bound weakly, if at all, to Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit. In a cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assay using Caco2 human colon epithelial cells, the 7A12B3 mAb was found to be a potent inhibitor of CTX, whereas 9F9C7 had relatively weak inhibitory activity. Meanwhile, the 9F9C7 mAb effectively detected CTB and EPICERTIN bound to the surface of Caco2 cells and mouse spleen leukocytes by flow cytometry. Using 9F9C7 in immunohistochemistry, we confirmed the preferential localization of EPICERTIN in colon crypts following oral administration of the protein in mice.

    "abstract": "Multifunctional CD4+ T helper 1 (Th1) cells, producing IFN-{gamma}, TNF- and IL-2, define a correlate of vaccine-mediated protection against intracellular infection. In our previous study, we found that CVC1302 in oil formulation promoted the differentiation of IFN-{gamma}+/TNF-+/IL-2+ Th1 cells. In order to extend the application of CVC1302 in oil formulation, this study aimed to elucidate the mechanism of action in improving the Th1 immune response. Considering the signals required for the differentiation of CD4+ T cells to Th1 cells, we detected the distribution of innate immune cells and the model antigen OVA-FITC in lymph node (LN), as well as the quantity of cytokines produced by the innate immune cells. The results of these experiments show that, cDC2 and OVA-FITC localized to inter-follicular region (IFR) of the draining lymph nodes, inflammatory monocytes localized to both IFR and T cell zone, which mainly infiltrate from the blood. In this inflammatory niche within LN, CD4+ T cells were attracted into IFR by CXCL10, secreting by inflammatory monocytes, then activated by IL-12-secreting cDC2. Above all, CVC1302 in oil formulation, on the one hand, targeted antigen and inflammatory monocyte into the LN IFN in order to attract CD4+ T cells, on the other hand, targeted cDC2 to produce IL-12 in order to promote optimal Th1 differentiation. The new finding will provide a blueprint for application of immunopotentiators in optimal formulations.\n\nImportanceAlong with the development of veterinary immunology, immunopotentiator and delivery system were not simply mixed with antigen, more and more attentions paid on the optimal compatibility in order to induce multifunctional immune responses. As reported, LPS formulated in IFA targeted antigens to the IFR of the LN, and recruited Mo into the IFR, then attracted antigen-specific CD4+ T cells, which differentiated into Th1 cells under the IL-12 produced by DC-SIGN+ DC(1). Herein, we further found that CVC1302 formulated with Marcol 52 induced enhanced Th1 immunity. Combined with our previous finding that CVC1302 in oil formulation induced improved humoral immunity, we concluded that CVC1302 in oil formulation provided multifunctional immunity, not only higher antibody titers to prevent pathogen infection, but also cellular immunity cytokine to prevent viral shedding.",

These include developing the capacity for biofilm-dependent blockage of the flea foregut to enable transmission by flea bite. Previously, we showed that pseudogenisation of rcsA, encoding a component of the Rcs signalling pathway, is an important evolutionary step facilitating Y. pestis flea-borne transmission. Additionally, rcsD, another important gene in the Rcs system, harbours a frameshift mutation. Here, we demonstrated that this rcsD mutation resulted in predominant production of a small protein composing the C-terminal RcsD histidine-phosphotransferase domain (designated RcsD-Hpt) and low levels of full-length RcsD. Genetic analysis revealed that the rcsD frameshift mutation followed the emergence of rcsA pseudogenisation. It further altered the canonical Rcs phosphorylation signal cascade, fine-tuning biofilm production to be conducive with retention of the pgm locus in modern lineages of Y. pestis. Taken together, our findings suggest that a frameshift mutation in rcsD, is an important evolutionary step that fine-tuned biofilm production to ensure perpetuation of flea-mammal plague transmission cycles.",

ZTF-7 is a putative ortholog of human ZNF277 that may contribute to language impairments. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) found that ZTF-7 interacted with RPS-2, which is a ribosomal protein of the small subunit and participates in pre-rRNA processing. A partial depletion of RPS-2 and other proteins of the small ribosomal subunit blocked the cold-warm stimuli-induced reduction of exosome subunits from the nucleoli.

    "abstract": "Novel genes have the potential to drive the evolution of new biological mechanisms, or to integrate into pre-existing regulatory circuits and contribute to the regulation of older, conserved biological functions. One such gene, the novel insect-specific gene oskar, was first identified based on its role in establishing the Drosophila melanogaster germ line. We previously showed that this gene likely arose through an unusual domain transfer event involving bacterial endosymbionts, and played a somatic role before evolving its well-known germ line function. Here, we provide empirical support for this hypothesis in the form of evidence for a novel neural role for oskar. We show that oskar is expressed in the adult neural stem cells of a hemimetabolous insect, the cricket Gryllus bimaculatus. In these stem cells, called neuroblasts, oskar is required together with the ancient animal transcription factor Creb to regulate long-term (but not short-term) olfactory memory. We provide evidence that oskar positively regulates Creb, which plays a conserved role in long-term memory across animals, and that oskar in turn may be a direct target of Creb. Together with previous reports of a role for oskar in nervous system development and function in crickets and flies, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that oskars original somatic role may have been in the insect nervous system. Moreover, its co-localization and functional cooperation with the conserved pluripotency gene piwi in the nervous system may have facilitated oskars later co-option to the germ line in holometabolous insects.",

Using isogenic pairs of iPSCs harboring different familial ALS mutations, we assess the capacity of iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, sensory neurons, astrocytes, and superficial cortical neurons to capture disease features including transcriptional and splicing dysregulation observed in human post-mortem neurons. At surprisingly early time points, differentially regulated genes in iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, but not other cell types, overlap with one-third of the differentially regulated genes in laser-dissected motor neurons from postmortem spinal cords. The extent of dysregulation correlates well between iPSC-derived and bona fide spinal motor neurons. In iPSC-derived spinal motor neurons, but not other derived cell types, we detect downregulation of genes affected by TDP-43-dependent aberrant splicing.

    "abstract": "Intracranial EEG (iEEG) data is a powerful way to map brain function, characterized by high temporal and spatial resolution, allowing the study of interactions among neuronal populations that orchestrate cognitive processing. However, the statistical inference and analysis of brain networks using iEEG data faces many challenges related to its sparse brain coverage, and its inhomogeneity across patients. We review these challenges and develop a methodological pipeline for estimation of network structure not obtainable from any single patient, illustrated on the inference of the interaction among visual streams using a dataset of 27 human iEEG recordings from a visual experiment employing visual scene stimuli. 100 ms sliding window and multiple band-pass filtered signals are used to provide temporal and spectral resolution. For the connectivity analysis we showcase two connectivity measures reflecting different types of interaction between regions of interest (ROI): Phase Locking Value as a symmetric measure of synchrony, and Directed Transfer Function - asymmetric measure describing causal interaction. For each two channels, initial uncorrected significance testing at p<0.05 for every time-frequency point is carried out by comparison of the data-derived connectivity to a baseline surrogate-based null distribution, providing a binary time-frequency connectivity map. For each ROI pair, a connectivity density map is obtained by averaging across all pairs of channels spanning them, effectively agglomerating data across relevant channels and subjects. Finally, the difference of the mean map value after and before the stimulation is compared to the same statistic in surrogate data to assess link significance.\n\nThe analysis confirmed the function of the parieto-medial temporal pathway, mediating visuospatial information between dorsal and ventral visual streams during visual scene analysis. Moreover, we observed the anterior hippocampal connectivity with more posterior areas in the medial temporal lobe, and found the reciprocal information flow between early processing areas and medial place area. To summarize, we developed an approach for estimating network connectivity, dealing with the challenge of sparse individual coverage of intracranial EEG electrodes. Its application provided new insights into the interaction between the dorsal and ventral visual streams, one of the iconic dualities in human cognition.",

    "abstract": "The amygdala is one of the most widely studied regions in behavioral neuroscience. A plethora of classical, and new paradigms have dissected its precise involvement in emotional and social sensing, learning, and memory. Several important insights resulted from the use of genetic markers - yet, in the age of single cell transcriptomics, the amygdala remains molecularly underdescribed. Here, we present a molecular cell type taxonomy of the full mouse amygdala in fear learning and consolidation. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on naive and fear conditioned mice, inferred the 130 neuronal cell types distributions in silico using orthogonal spatial transcriptomic datasets, and describe the cell types transcriptional responses to learning and memory consolidation. Only a fraction of cells, within a subset of all neuronal types, were transcriptionally responsive to fear learning, memory and retrieval. These activated engram cells upregulated activity-response genes, and processes of synaptic signaling, plasticity, development and neurite outgrowth. Our transcriptome-wide data confirm known actors, and describe several new candidate genes. The atlas may help pinpoint the amygdalas circuits in performing emotional sensing and integration, and provide new insights to the global cellular processes involved.",

    "abstract": "Fricatives are obstruent sound contrasts made by airflow constrictions in the vocal tract that produce turbulence across the constriction or at a site downstream from the constriction. Fricatives exhibit significant intra/inter-subject and contextual variability. Yet fricatives are perceived with high accuracy. The current study investigated modeled neural responses to fricatives in the auditory nerve (AN) and inferior colliculus (IC), with the hypothesis that response profiles across populations of neurons provide robust correlates to consonant perception. Stimuli were 270 intervocalic fricatives (10 speakers x 9 fricatives x 3 utterances). Computational model response profiles had characteristic frequencies that were log-spaced from 125 Hz to 8 or 20 kHz, to explore the impact of high-frequency responses. Confusion matrices generated by k-nearest-neighbor subspace classifiers were based on the profiles of average rates across characteristic frequencies as feature vectors. Model confusion matrices were compared them with published behavioral data. The modeled AN and IC neural responses provided better predictions of behavioral accuracy than the stimulus spectra, with IC showing better accuracy than AN. Behavioral fricative accuracy was explained by modeled neural response profiles, whereas confusions were only partially explained. Extended frequencies improved accuracy based on the model IC, corroborating the importance of extended high frequencies in speech perception.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSocial memory is essential to the functioning of a social animal within a group. Estrogens can affect social memory too quickly for classical genomic mechanisms. Previously, 17{beta}-estradiol (E2) rapidly facilitated short-term social memory and increased nascent synapse formation, these synapses being potentiated following neuronal activity. However, what mechanisms underlie and co-ordinate the rapid facilitation of social memory and synaptogenesis are unclear. Here, the necessity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling for rapid facilitation of short-term social memory and synaptogenesis was tested.\n\nMethodsMice performed a short-term social memory task or were used as task-naive controls. ERK and PI3K pathway inhibitors were infused intra-dorsal hippocampally 5 minutes before E2 infusion. Forty minutes following intrahippocampal E2 or vehicle administration, tissues were collected for quantification of glutamatergic synapse number in the CA1.\n\nResultsDorsal hippocampal E2 rapid facilitation of short-term social memory depended upon ERK and PI3K pathways. E2 increased glutamatergic synapse number (GluA1/bassoon colocalization) in task-performing mice but decreased synapse number in task-naive mice. Critically, ERK signaling was required for synapse formation/elimination in task-performing and task-naive mice, whereas PI3K inhibition blocked synapse formation only in task-performing mice.\n\nConclusionsWhilst ERK and PI3K are both required for E2 facilitation of short-term social memory and synapse formation, only ERK is required for synapse elimination. This demonstrates previously unknown, bidirectional, rapid actions of E2 on brain and behaviour and underscores the importance of estrogen signaling in the brain to social behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Previously we demonstrated that intra-hippocampal infusion of purified, Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) extracellular domain into the mouse hippocampus rapidly promotes formation of GABAergic synapses and decreases seizure susceptibility in mice. Given the relatively fast action of Sema4D treatment revealed by these studies, we sought to determine the time course of Sema4D treatment on hippocampal network activity using an acute hippocampal slice preparation. We performed long-term extracellular recordings from area CA1 encompassing a 2 hour application of Sema4D and found that hippocampal excitation is suppressed hours following treatment. We also asked if Sema4D treatment could ameliorate seizures in an acute seizure model: the kainic acid (KA) mouse model of Status Epilepticus (SE). We demonstrate that Sema4D treatment suppresses seizures and lessens benzodiazepine (BZD) insensitivity which is a hallmark of refractory SE. Lastly, we sought to explore alternative methods of Sema4D delivery to hippocampus and thus created an Adeno Associated Virus expressing the extracellular domain of Sema4D. Our data reveal that virally delivered, chronically overexpressed Sema4D extracellular domain promotes GABAergic synapse formation and suppresses seizure activity similar to the actions of purified Sema4D protein. These results provide proof of concept that Sema4D-mediated GABAergic synapse development could combat BZD insensitivity in intractable forms of epilepsy, and that viral delivery of Sema4D is an efficacious and promising delivery method.",

    "abstract": "Humans estimate sound-source directions by combining prior beliefs with sensory evidence. Prior beliefs represent statistical knowledge about the environment while sensory evidence is acquired from auditory features such as interaural disparities and monaural spectral shapes. Models of directional sound localization often impose constraints on the contribution of these features to either the horizontal or vertical dimension. Instead, we propose a Bayesian model that more flexibly incorporates each feature according to its spatial precision and integrates prior beliefs in the inference process. We applied the model to directional localization of a single, broadband, stationary sound source presented to a static human listener in an anechoic environment. We simplified interaural features to be broadband and compared two model variants, each considering a different type of monaural spectral features: magnitude profiles and gradient profiles. Both model variants were fitted to the baseline performance of five listeners and evaluated on the effects of localizing with non-individual head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) and sounds with rippled spectrum. The model variant with spectral gradient profiles outperformed other localization models. This model variant appears particularly useful for the evaluation of HRTFs and may serve as a basis for future extensions towards modeling dynamic listening conditions.",

    "abstract": "The orientation of sketch maps of remote but familiar city squares produced from memory has been shown to depend on the distance and airline direction from the production site to the remembered square (position dependent recall, Rohrich, Hardiess, & Mallot, 2014). Here, we present a virtual reality version of the original experiment and additionaly study the role of body orientation. Three main points can be made: First, \"immersive sketching\" is a novel and useful paradigm in which subjects sketch maps live on paper while being immersed in virtual reality. Second, the original effect of position dependent recall was confirmed, indicating that the sense of presence generated in a virtual environment suffices to bias the imagery of distant places. Finally, the orientation of the produced sketch maps depended also on the body orientation of the subjects. At each production site, body orientation was controlled by varying the position of the life feed in the virtual environment such that subjects had to turn towards the prescribed direction. Position dependent recall is strongest if subjects are aligned with the airline direction to the target and virtually goes away if they turn in the opposite direction.",
