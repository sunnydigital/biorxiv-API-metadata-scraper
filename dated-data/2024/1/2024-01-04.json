    "abstract": "Feline coronavirus (FCoV) infection normally causes mild or subclinical signs and is common in domestic cats. However, in some cats, FCoV infection can also lead to the development of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)--a typically lethal disease. FCoV has two serotypes or genotypes, FCoV-1 and FCoV-2, both of which can cause FIP. The main difference between the genotypes is the viral spike (S) protein that determines tropism and pathogenicity, crucial mechanisms in the development of FIP. Subclinical infection and FIP have both been reported in wild felids, including in threatened species. Due to the high genetic variability of the S gene and the technical challenges to sequencing it, detection and characterization of FCoV in wild felids have mainly centered on other more conserved genes. Therefore, the genotype causing FIP in most wild felids remains unknown. Here, we report a retrospective molecular epidemiological investigation of FCoV in a zoological institution in the United States. In 2008, a domestic cat (Felis catus) and a Pallas cat (Otocolobus manul) sharing the same room succumbed to FIP. Using hybridization capture and next-generation sequencing, we detected and sequenced the complete 3-end of the viral genome ([~]8.2 Kb), including the S gene, from both felids. Our data show for the first time that FCoV-1 can be transmitted between domestic and wild felids and extends the known host range of FCoV-1. Our findings highlight the importance of identifying the genotype causing FIP, to develop effective control measures.",

    "abstract": "Gametes are produced via meiosis, a specialized cell division associated with frequent errors which cause birth defects and infertility. Uniquely in meiosis I, homologous chromosomes segregate to opposite poles, usually requiring their linkage by chiasmata, the products of crossover recombination1. The spindle checkpoint delays cell cycle progression until all chromosomes are properly attached to microtubules2 but the steps leading to the capture and alignment of chromosomes on the meiosis I spindle remain poorly understood. In budding yeast meiosis I, Mad2 and Mad3BUBR1 are equally important for spindle checkpoint delay, but biorientation of homologs on the meiosis I spindle requires Mad2, but not Mad3BUBR1 3,4. Here we show that Mad3BUBR1 promotes accurate meiosis I homolog segregation outside its canonical checkpoint role, independently of Mad2. We find that Mad3BUBR1 associates with the TOGL1 domain of Stu1CLASP, a conserved plus-end microtubule protein which is important for chromosome capture onto the spindle. Homologous chromosome pairs that are proficient in crossover formation, but which fail to biorient, rely on Mad3BUBR1-Stu1CLASP to ensure their efficient attachment to microtubules and segregation during meiosis I. Furthermore, we show that Mad3BUBR1-Stu1CLASP are essential to rescue the segregation of mini-chromosomes lacking crossovers. Our findings define a new pathway ensuring microtubule-dependent chromosome capture and demonstrate that spindle checkpoint proteins safeguard the fidelity of chromosome segregation both by actively promoting chromosome alignment and delaying cell cycle progression until this has occurred.",

    "abstract": "Cells have evolved a variety of mechanisms to respond to stress, such as activating the PERK- eIF2 pathway and forming stress granules (SGs). It is important that these mechanisms are inducted only when necessary and exerted at appropriate levels, to prevent spontaneous or excessive activation of stress responses. However, the mechanisms by which cells keep the stress response programs in check are elusive. In this study, we discovered that downregulation of Cell Division Cycle 5 Like (CDC5L) causes spontaneous SG formation in the absence of any stress, which is independent of its known functions in the cell cycle or the PRP19 complex. Instead, we found that CDC5L binds to the PERK promoter through its DNA-binding domains and represses PERK mRNA transcription. As a result, it negatively regulates the abundance of PERK protein and the phosphorylation levels of eIF2, thereby suppressing the PERK-eIF2 signaling pathway and preventing undesirable SG assembly. Further RNA-sequencing (seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq analyses reveal a dual function of CDC5L in gene transcription: it acts as a transcriptional activator in cell cycle control but as a repressor in cellular stress responses. Finally, we show that the loss of CDC5L decreases cell viability and fly survival under mild stress conditions. Together, our findings demonstrate a previously unknown role and mechanism of CDC5L in the surveillance of cellular stress through transcriptional repression, which serves as a gatekeeper for the stress response programs such as the PERK-eIF2 pathway and SG formation.\n\nSignificance statementCells need to respond to stress promptly for survival. Meanwhile, it is equally important to prevent spontaneous or excessive activation of stress response programs when no stress or only minor stress is present. Here, we reveal that the DNA/RNA-binding protein CDC5L represses the transcription of a cluster of stress response genes including PERK. In doing so, CDC5L suppresses the PERK-eIF2 pathway and prevents spontaneous SG assembly. Downregulation of CDC5L releases the restraint on these genes, resulting in an exaggerated response to stress and decreased viability in both cell and fly models. Taken together, this study demonstrates the existence of a gatekeeper mechanism that surveils the stress response programs and highlights the crucial role of CDC5L-mediated transcriptional repression in this regulation.",

    "abstract": "The abundances of fungi and bacteria in soil are used as simple predictors for carbon dynamics, and represent widely available microbial traits. Soil biomarkers serve as quantitative estimates of these microbial groups, though not quantifying microbial biomass per se. The accurate conversion to microbial carbon pools, and an understanding of its comparability among soils is therefore needed. We refined conversion factors for classical fungal biomarkers, and evaluated the application of quantitative PCR (qPCR, rDNA copies) as a biomarker for soil fungi. Based on biomarker contents in pure fungal cultures of 30 isolates, combined with available references, we propose average conversion factors of 95.3 g fungal C g-1 ergosterol, 32.0 mg fungal C {micro}mol-1 PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and 0.264 pg fungal C ITS1 DNA copy-1. As expected, interspecific variability was most pronounced in rDNA copies, though qPCR results showed the least phylogenetic bias. A modeling approach based on exemplary agricultural soils further supported the hypothesis that high diversity in soil buffers against biomarker variability, whereas also phylogenetic biases impact the accuracy of comparisons in biomarker estimates. Our analyses suggest that qPCR results cover the fungal community in soil best, though with a variability only partly offset in highly diverse soils. PLFA 18:2{omega}6,9 and ergosterol represent accurate biomarkers to quantify Ascomycota and Basidiomycota. To conclude, the ecological interpretation and coverage of biomarker data prior to their application in global models is important, where the combination of different biomarkers may be most insightful.",

    "abstract": "Individuals must regularly choose between prosocial and proself behaviors. While past neuroscience research has revealed the neural foundations for prosocial behaviors, many studies have oversimplified proself behaviors, viewing them merely as a reward-maximization process. However, recent behavioral evidence suggests that response times for proself behaviors are often slower than those for prosocial behaviors, suggesting a more complex interdependence between prosocial and proself neural computations. To address this issue, we conducted an fMRI experiment with the ultimatum game, where participants were requested to accept (money distributed as proposed) or reject (both sides receive none) offers of money distribution. In the decisions, the participants could maximize self-interest by accepting the offer (i.e., proself), while by rejecting it, they could punish unfair proposers and promote the \"equity\" social norm (i.e., prosocial). We constructed a drift diffusion model (DDM) that considers both behavioral choices and response times and used the DDM parameters in our fMRI analysis. We observed that participants who suppressed inequity-driven rejection behaviors displayed heightened dACC activity in response to disadvantageous inequity. Importantly, our functional connectivity analysis demonstrated that the dACC exhibited negative functional connectivity with the amygdala when unfair offers were presented. Furthermore, the PPI connectivity encoded the average reaction time for accepting unfair offers (i.e., proself behaviors). Considering that the amygdala also responded to disadvantageous inequity in these experiments and previous studies, these results show that the top-down control of prosocial motives (i.e., aversion to disadvantageous inequity) plays a key role in implementing proself behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The subjective experience of emotions is rooted in the contextualized perception of changes in bodily (e.g., heart) activity. Increased emotional arousal (EA) has been related to lower high- frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV), lower EEG parieto-occipital alpha power, and higher heartbeat-evoked potential (HEP) amplitudes. We studied EA-related brain-heart interactions (BHIs) using immersive virtual reality (VR) for naturalistic yet controlled emotion induction. 29 healthy adults (13 women, age: 26{+/-}3) completed a VR experience that included rollercoasters while EEG and ECG were recorded. Continuous EA ratings were collected during a video replay immediately after. We analyzed EA-related changes in HF-HRV as well as in BHIs using HEPs and directional functional BHI modeling.\n\nHigher EA was associated with lower HEP amplitudes in a left fronto-central electrode cluster. While parasympathetic modulation of the heart (HF-HRV) and parieto-occipital EEG alpha power were reduced during higher EA, there was no evidence for the hypothesized EA-related changes in bidirectional information flow between them. Whole-brain exploratory analyses in additional EEG (delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma) and HRV (low-frequency, LF, and HF) frequency bands indicated a temporo-occipital cluster, in which higher EA was linked to decreased brain-to-heart (gamma[-&gt;]HF-HRV) and increased heart-to-brain (LF-HRV[-&gt;]gamma) information flow. Our results confirm previous findings from less naturalistic experiments and suggest EA-related BHI changes in temporo-occipital gamma power.",

Exploring biomarkers of T2DM based on single-cell sequencing technology can provide new insights for the discovery of metformin treatment T2DM in molecular mechanisms.\n\nMethodsWe profiled 43,971 cells and 20,228 genes from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of T2DM patients and healthy controls by single-nucleotide RNA sequencing.\n\nResultsB cells, T cells, monocytes/macrophages, platelets, neutrophils, NK cells and cDC2s were grouped into 7 subclusters. Furthermore, T cells and monocytes/macrophages might be significantly correlated with the clinical characteristics of T2DM patients. RPL27 and AC018755.4 expression were strongly negative correlated with HbA1c. CD4+ T cells are mainly in the memory activation stage, and CD8+ T cells are effectors. The 50 genes whose expression varied with developmental time were associated with cytoplasmic translation, cell-cell adhesion mediated by integrin, and the regulation of the inflammatory response. Monocytes/macrophages include classic monocytes and nonclassical monocytes. The GSEA results showed that the marker genes were enriched in the HALLMARK_INTERFERON_GAMMA_RESPONSE and HALLMARK_TNFA_SIGNALING_VIA_NFKB. The WGCNA results showed 14 modules.

Further analysis revealed ligand-receptor pairs, including MIF-(CD74 + CD44), MIF-(CD74 + CXCR4), ANXA1-FPR1 and LGALS9-CD45.\n\nConclusionsOur study revealed that the transcriptional map of immune cells from PBMCs provided a framework for understanding the immune status of T2DM patients with metformin treatment via scRNA-seq analysis.",

    "abstract": "Fungi typically occur in environments where numerous and diverse other microbes occur as well, often resulting in fierce competition for nutrients and habitat. To support fungal fitness in these environments, they evolved various mechanisms that mediate direct antagonism towards niche competitors. Among these, the secretion of proteins with antimicrobial activities has been reported in fungi with diverse lifestyles. Recently, several plant-associated fungi were shown to rely on the secretion of antimicrobial effector proteins to antagonize certain members of plant hosts microbiota and to successfully colonize plant tissues. Some of these effectors do not share homology with known antimicrobials and represent novel antibiotics. Accordingly, the occurrence and conservation of proteinaceous antimicrobials throughout the fungal tree of life remains enigmatic. Here we present a computational approach to annotate candidate antimicrobial effectors in fungal secretomes based on protein physicochemical properties. After curating a set of proteins that were experimentally verified to display antimicrobial activity and a set of proteins that lack such activity, we trained a machine learning classifier on properties of protein sequences and predicted structures. This predictor performs particularly well on fungal proteins (R2=0.89) according to our validations and is delivered as a software package named AMAPEC, dedicated to antimicrobial activity prediction for effector candidates. We subsequently used this novel software to predict antimicrobial effector catalogs in three phylogenetically distant fungi with distinct lifestyles, revealing relatively large catalogs of candidate antimicrobials for each of the three fungi, and suggesting a broad occurrence of such proteins throughout the fungal kingdom. Thus, AMAPEC is a unique method to uncover antimicrobials in fungal secretomes that are often sparsely functionally annotated, and may assist biological interpretations during omic analyses.

    "abstract": "Upregulation of mitochondrial respiration coupled with high ROS-scavenging capacity is a characteristic shared by drug-tolerant cells in several cancers. As translational fidelity is essential for cell fitness, protection of the mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes from oxidative damage is pivotal. While mechanisms for recognizing and repairing such damage exist in the cytoplasm, the corresponding process in the mitochondria remains unclear.\n\nBy performing Ascorbate PEroXidase (APEX)-proximity ligation assay directed to the mitochondrial matrix followed by isolation and sequencing of RNA associated to mitochondrial proteins, we identified the nuclear-encoded lncRNA ROSALIND as an interacting partner of ribosomes. ROSALIND is upregulated in recurrent tumours and its expression can discriminate between responders and non-responders to immune checkpoint blockade in a melanoma cohort of patients. Featuring an unusually high G content, ROSALIND serves as a substrate for oxidation. Consequently, inhibiting ROSALIND leads to an increase in ROS and protein oxidation, resulting in severe mitochondrial respiration defects. This, in turn, impairs melanoma cell viability and increases immunogenicity both in vitro and ex vivo in preclinical humanized cancer models. These findings underscore the role of ROSALIND as a novel ROS buffering system, safeguarding mitochondrial translation from oxidative stress, and shed light on potential therapeutic strategies for overcoming cancer therapy resistance.",

Various chemotherapeutics are linked to muscle wasting or cachexia, drastically reducing the chance of survivability of cancer patients. Insights into the molecular basis of chemotherapy-induced cachexia is an unmet need to improve the treatment strategies. Here, we investigated the tyrosine kinase inhibitor class of chemotherapeutic agents for their effects on muscle function. Sorafenib, but not Nilotinib and Imatinib, triggered cachexia. System-wide transcriptome and proteome analyses revealed that Sorafenib alters the global transcriptional program and proteostasis in muscle cells. Mechanistically, Sorafenib treatment reduced active epigenetic mark H3K4 methylation on distinct muscle-specific genes due to the defective chromatin association of SET1/A, a catalytic component of the SET1/MLL complex. It favored transcriptionally incompetent chromatin, characterized by diminished association with RNA polymerase II. The transcriptional reorientation led to disrupted sarcomere organization, calcium homeostasis, and mitochondrial respiration. Consequently, the contractile ability of muscle cells was severely compromised. Collectively, we identified an unanticipated transcriptional mechanism underlying Sorafenib-induced cachexia. Our findings hold the potential to strategize therapy regimens to minimize chemotherapy-induced cachexia and improve treatment outcomes.",

Assessment of IPAs, however, often relies on criteria related to species, while incorporation of habitats has been less consistent. Using Uganda as a case study, we test the application of the threatened habitat criterion - criterion C. We identified nationally threatened habitats using Red List of Ecosystems criteria and assess, for the first time, how differing application of thresholds under criterion C can influence IPA network outcomes. Eleven threatened habitats were identified, with declines switching from predominantly forest to savanna after the mid-20th century. Significantly, we found current IPA guidance on use of Criterion C needlessly limits the number of sites that qualify as IPAs. The \"five best sites\" threshold is reserved for countries where quantitative data is unavailable, however, the application of the relevant thresholds to quantitative data largely generated fewer than five IPAs, comparably limiting conservation opportunities identified. We recommend, therefore, that the \"five best\" threshold is available for application on both qualitative and quantitative data. This will bolster the value of IPAs in conserving and restoring threatened and ecologically important habitats under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.",

    "abstract": "Nutrition can mediate host-pathogen interactions indirectly when specific deficiencies (e.g. iron or glutamine) constrain host immune performance. Nutrition can also directly govern these interactions since invading pathogens colonize finite landscapes of nutritionally variable host tissues that must be optimally foraged during pathogen development. We first used a conceptual framework of nutritional niches to show that insect-pathogenic Metarhizium fungi navigate host landscapes where different tissues vary widely in (protein (P) and carbohydrates (C)). We next tested whether host-specific Metarhizium species have narrower fundamental nutritional niches (FNN) than host-generalists by measuring pathogen performance across an in vitro nutritional landscape simulating a within-host foraging environment. We then tested how developing pathogens navigate nutritional landscapes by developing a liquid-media approach to track pathogen intake of P and C over time. Host-specificity did not govern FNN dimensions as three tested Metarhizium species: 1) grew maximally across C treatments assuming P was present above a lower threshold, and 2) similarly initiated dispersal behaviors and sporulated when either C or P became depleted. However, specialist and generalist pathogens navigated nutritional landscapes differently. The host specialist (M. acridum) first prioritized C intake, but generalists (M. anisopliae, M. robertsii) prioritized P and C according to their availability. Numbers of known hosts may be insufficient to delimit pathogens as specialists or generalists since diverse hosts do not necessarily comprise diverse nutritional landscapes. Instead, immune responses of hosts and nutritional niche breadth of pathogens are likely co-equal evolutionary drivers of host specificity.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDPersistent deficits in working memory (WM) and attention have considerable clinical and functional impact in people with bipolar disorder (PBD). Understanding the neurocognitive underpinnings of these interacting cognitive constructs might facilitate the discovery of more effective pro-cognitive interventions. Therefore, we employed a paradigm designed for jointly studying attentional control and WM encoding.\n\nMETHODSWe used a visuospatial change-detection task using four Gabor Patches with differing orientations in 63 euthymic PBD and 76 healthy controls (HCS), which investigated attentional competition during WM encoding. To manipulate bottom-up attention using stimulus salience, two Gabor patches flickered, which were designated as either targets or distractors. To manipulate top-down attention, the Gabor patches were preceded by either a predictive or a non-predictive cue for the target locations.\n\nRESULTSAcross all task conditions, PBD stored significantly less information in visual WM than HCS (significant effect of group). However, we observed no significant group by salience or group by cue interactions. This indicates that impaired WM was not caused by deficits in attentional control.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results imply that while WM is disturbed in PBD, attentional prioritization of salient targets and distractors as well as the utilization of external top-down cues were not compromised. Consequently, the control of attentional selection appears be intact. These findings provide important constraints for models of WM dysfunction in PBD by indicating that later stages of WM encoding are likely primarily impaired. We also demonstrate that selective attention is not among the main sources of cognitive impairment in PBD.",

    "abstract": "Neural oscillations mediate coordination of activity within and between brain networks, supporting cognition and behaviour. How these processes develop throughout childhood is not only a critical neuroscientific question but could also shed light on the mechanisms underlying neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, measuring the neurodevelopmental trajectory of oscillations has been hampered by confounds from instrumentation. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of a disruptive new imaging platform - Optically Pumped Magnetometer-based magnetoencephalography (OPM-MEG) - to study oscillations during brain development. We show how a unique 192-channel OPM-MEG device, which is adaptable to head size and robust to participant movement, can be used to collect high-fidelity electrophysiological data in individuals aged between 2 and 34 years. Data were collected during a somatosensory task, and we measured both stimulus-induced modulation of beta oscillations in sensory cortex, and whole-brain connectivity, showing that both modulate significantly with age. Moreover, we show that pan-spectral bursts of electrophysiological activity drive beta oscillations throughout neurodevelopment, and how their probability of occurrence and spectral content changes with age. Our results offer new insights into the developmental trajectory of oscillations and provide the first clear evidence that OPM-MEG is an ideal platform for studying electrophysiology in children.",

Still, the mechanisms governing the targeting of selected regions of the genome to nucleolus-associated domains (NADs) remain enigmatic. Here we reveal the essential role of ZNF274, a SCAN-bearing member of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB)-containing zinc finger proteins (KZFP) family, in sequestering lineage-specific gene clusters within NADs. Ablation of ZNF274 triggers transcriptional activation across entire genomic neighborhoods - encompassing, among others, protocadherin and KZFP-encoding genes - with loss of repressive chromatin marks, altered 3D genome architecture and de novo CTCF binding. Mechanistically, ZNF274 anchors target DNA sequences at the nucleolus and facilitates their compartmentalization via a previously uncharted function of the SCAN domain. Our findings illuminate the mechanisms underlying NADs organization and suggest that perinucleolar entrapment into repressive hubs constrains the activation of tandemly arrayed genes to enable selective expression and modulate cell differentiation programs during development.",

VPS4A accumulates at the cytoplasmic viral assembly complex (cVAC) of cells infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), the site where nascent virus particles obtain their membrane envelope. Here we show that VPS4A is recruited to the cVAC via interaction with pUL71. Sequence analysis, deep-learning structure prediction, molecular dynamics and mutagenic analysis identify a short peptide motif in the C-terminal region of pUL71 that is necessary and sufficient for the interaction with VPS4A. This motif is predicted to bind the same groove of the N-terminal VPS4A Microtubule-Interacting and Trafficking (MIT) domain as the Type 2 MIT-Interacting Motif (MIM2) of cellular ESCRT-III components, and this viral MIM2-like motif (vMIM2) is conserved across {beta}-herpesvirus pUL71 homologues. However, recruitment of VPS4A by pUL71 is dispensable for HCMV morphogenesis or replication and the function of the conserved vMIM2 during infection remains enigmatic. VPS4-recruitment via a vMIM2 represents a previously unknown mechanism of molecular mimicry in viruses, extending previous observations that herpesviruses encode proteins with structural and functional homology to cellular ESCRT-III components.",

    "abstract": "Surgical resection remains the gold standard for liver tumor treatment, yet the emergence of post-operative liver failure, known as the small for size syndrome (SFSS), poses a substantial challenge. The activation of hypoxia sensors in a SFSS liver remnant initiated early angiogenesis, improving vascular architecture, safeguarding against liver failure and reducing mortality. The study aimed to elucidate vascular remodeling mechanisms in SFSS, its impact on hepatocyte function and subsequent liver failure. Mice underwent extended partial hepatectomy to induce SFSS, a subset were exposed to hypoxia immediately after surgery. Hypoxia bolstered post- hepatectomy survival rates. Early proliferation of liver sinusoidal cells coupled with augmented recruitment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) via the VEGF/SDF-1 pathway resulted in heightened vascular density, improved lobular perfusion, and limited hemorrhagic events in the regenerating liver under hypoxia. The administration of G-CSF mimicked the effects of hypoxia on vascular remodeling and EPC recruitment, though it failed to rescue survival. Compared to normoxia, hypoxia restrained hepatocyte proliferation yet improved the function of the regenerating remnant, favoring functional preservation in the liver remnant. Injection of AAV8- TBG-HNF4 virus for hepatocyte-specific overexpression of HNF4, the master regulator of hepatocyte function, enforced functionality in proliferating hepatocytes. The combination, only, of HNF4 overexpression and G-CSF treatment rescued survival post-SFSS-setting hepatectomy. In summary, SFSS arises due to imbalance and desynchronized interplay between functional regeneration and vascular restructuring. To enhance survival following SFSS-hepatectomy, a two- pronged strategy is essential, addressing the preservation of function in the proliferating parenchymal cells alongside the simultaneous mitigation of vascular harm.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryCombined treatment with G-CSF and HNF4 overexpression rescues vascular damage and function to improve survival after extended hepatectomy in mice.",

    "abstract": "The complete 40-nt CRISPR RNA (crRNA) of Cas12a can be artificially divided into two parts, including the 20-nt scaffold RNA with fixed sequences and the 20-nt spacer RNA with variable sequences, respectively. Herein, we found that Cas12a protein, scaffold RNA, and spacer RNA can be reassembled into an active ribonucleoprotein (RNP) which has a trans-cleavage activity comparable to that of wild-type Cas12a RNP. By leveraging such split CRISPR-Cas12a system (SCas12a), we devised fast fluorescence and lateral flow assays for highly sensitive, selective, and multiplexed detection of miRNAs without the need for reverse transcription and pre-amplification, achieving a limit of detection (LoD) of 10 fM. Additionally, our SCas12a assay enables detecting long-stranded RNA without secondary structure, as well as distinguishing mature miRNA from its precursor (pre-miRNA) that comprises the same sequence of miRNA. Beyond RNA detection, SCas12a outperforms wild-type Cas12a in specificity towards DNA point mutations. In combination with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), we set up a one-pot assay to detect attomolar concentrations of human papillomavirus (HPV) in patient samples. In conclusion, this work provides a simple, cost-effective, yet powerful SCas12a-based rapid nucleic acid detection platform in various diagnostic settings.\n\nSignificance StatementConventional Cas12a-based diagnostic methods cannot directly detect RNA targets. Here, we develop rapid fluorescence and lateral flow assays based on a split Cas12a system (called SCas12a), achieving amplification-free detection of RNA with high sensitivity and specificity. By supplying pooled activators, our method enables multiplexed detection of miRNA and DNA targets. In addition, SCas12a can discriminate mature miRNA from its pre-miRNA, which was achieved for the first time with CRISPR detection technology. Moreover, SCas12a outperforms wild-type Cas12a in specificity towards point mutation and can be combined with RPA to detect attomolar concentration of HPV in patient samples. Overall, this work offers a generic \"split crRNA-activator\" strategy for developing new CRISPR diagnostic tools.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the pathophysiological dynamics which underline interictal epileptiform events (IEEs) such as epileptic spikes, spike-and-waves or High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) is of major importance in the context of neocortical refractory epilepsy, as it paves the way for the development of novel therapies. Typically, these events are detected in local field potential (LFP) recordings obtained through depth electrodes during pre-surgical investigations. Although essential, the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms for the generation of these epileptic neuromarkers remain unclear. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel neurophysiologically relevant reconstruction of the neocortical microcircuitry in the context of epilepsy. This reconstruction intends to facilitate the analysis of a comprehensive set of parameters encompassing physiological, morphological, and biophysical aspects that directly impact the generation and recording of different IEEs. Accordingly, a novel microscale computational model of an epileptic neocortical column was introduced. This model incorporates the intricate multilayered structure of the cortex and allows for the simulation of realistic interictal epileptic signals. The proposed model was validated through comparisons with real IEEs recorded using intracranial stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) signals from both humans and animals. Using the model, the user can recreate epileptiform patterns observed in different species (human, rodent, and mouse) and study the intracellular activity associated with these patterns. Our model allowed us to unravel the relationship between glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic transmission of the epileptic neural network and the type of generated IEE. Moreover, sensitivity analyses allowed for the exploration of the pathophysiological parameters responsible for the transitions between these events. Finally, the presented modeling framework also provides an Electrode Tissue Model (ETI) that adds realism to the simulated signals and offers the possibility of studying their sensitivity to the electrode characteristics. The model (NeoCoMM) presented in this work can be of great use in different applications since it offers an in silico framework for sensitivity analysis and hypothesis testing. It can also be used as a starting point for more complex studies.",

DSPN is a multifactorial disease and not fully understood yet. In order to address this, we developed the Interpretable Multimodal Machine Learning (IMML) framework for predicting DSPN prevalence and incidence based on sparse multimodal data. Exploiting IMMLs interpretability further empowered biomarker identification. We leveraged the population-based KORA F4/FF4 cohort including 1,091 participants and their deep multimodal characterisation, i.e. clinical data, genomics, methylomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, inflammatory proteins and metabolomics. Clinical data alone was sufficient to stratify individuals with and without DSPN (AUROC = 0.752), whilst predicting DSPN incidence 6.5{+/-}0.2 years later strongly benefitted from clinical data complemented with two or more molecular modalities (improved {Delta}AUROC >0.1, achieved AUROC of 0.714). Important and interpretable features of the prediction of incident DSPN included up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines, down-regulation of SUMOylation pathway and essential fatty acids, thus yielding novel insights in the disease pathophysiology. These may become biomarkers for incident DSPN, guide prevention strategies and serve as proof of concept for the utility of IMML in studying complex diseases.",

In the current study, 3-epicaryoptin was tested for the molecular mechanism of its anti-cancer activity in the human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7. We investigated cell viability by MTT assay, cell cycle kinetics and apoptosis, immunofluorescence straining, molecular modelling, and ADMET profiling. MTT assay results showed that 3-epicaryoptin was found cytotoxic against MCF-7 cells with an IC50 value of 344.64 {micro}g mL-1 for 48 h. Flow cytometric analysis exhibited that 3-epicaryoptin halted the MCF-7 cells in the G2/M phase and subsequently induced apoptosis in a time-dependent manner. Our immunofluorescence studies indicated that 3-epicaryoptin inhibited microtubule polymerization in MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies demonstrated the ability of 3-epicaryoptin to interact with the tubulin protein at the colchicine binding pockets. Overall, our results suggest that 3-epicaryoptin can inhibit the proliferation of human breast cancer cells by depolymerizing of cellular microtubule networks, which causes cell cycle arrest and promotes apoptotic cell death. Therefore, it has been indicated that the natural product 3-epicaryoptin exhibited considerable promise as a potent therapeutic agent capable of inducing apoptosis in breast cancer cells.",

Here, we asked whether age differences in a) functional connectivity to category-selective neural regions and b) segregation of the visual network (i.e., network dedifferentiation) contribute to regional dedifferentiation of categorical representations. Younger and older adults viewed blocks of face and house stimuli in the fMRI scanner. We found an age-related decline in neural distinctiveness for faces in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and for houses in the parahippocampal gyrus (PHG). Functional connectivity analyses revealed age differences in connectivity between the FG and visual network as well as age-related dedifferentiation of the visual network. Interindividual correlations demonstrated that regional distinctiveness was related to connectivity of category-selective regions to the visual network as well as network segregation. Thus, dedifferentiation of categorical representations may be linked to age-related reorganization of functional networks.",

    "abstract": "There has been a vision to conduct therapy using sunlight since ancient Greece, Egypt, and India. In modern medicine, photodynamic therapy is one popular form of therapy that uses light to excite photosensitizers to eliminate malignant and other diseased cells. It offers highly effective and broad-spectrum therapeutic efficacy. Yet, there are several hindrances to a real treatment of disease through photodynamic therapy, such as the limitation on the irradiation depth and areas, the regulation of side effects, etc. Usually, the patients should be kept in a dark environment during and after the therapeutic process for days to avoid side effects induced by light in daily life, not mention to conduct the phototherapy through sunbathing. Based on the above consideration, we propose an innovative idea to bring photodynamic therapy back to the origin of phototherapy-bathing in the sunshine. Namely, we designed a \"live drug\", as a smart hunter, named A-RAWs, by loading an \"off-on\" type of photosensitizer in macrophages to solve two technical problems. Firstly, to find and capture bacteria accurately, and then transport these bacteria to the epidermis through the blood capillary, where sunlight is reachable. Secondly, to minimize the potential side effects and maximize the therapeutic time windows and efficacy by using bacteria as the trigger of the photodynamic effect. Specifically, we first designed and synthesized a lysosome-targeted and inflammation-activated NIR photosensitizer (Lyso710A), and loaded it in the lysosomes of macrophages. These \"armed\" macrophages were transferred into the infected host to capture deep-tissue bacteria through innate immunity and transport the captured bacteria through the bloodstream to superficial skin. Finally, the pathogenic bacteria are killed by the photodynamic effect when transported to the epidermis and receive sunbathing. In vivo experiment demonstrates a 100% therapeutic efficiency on systemic bacterial infection model. We also demonstrated the working mechanism of this \"live drug\" using a lung infection model. This hunter demonstrates high intelligence to break the limitations of current photodynamic therapy and executes photodynamic therapy of deep-tissue bacterial infection simply by bathing in the sunshine.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=182 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/574019v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (92K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11331aeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@122baf6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1208bd5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bc672c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Microtubule organising centres (MTOCs) are sites of localised microtubule nucleation in eukaryotic cells. Regulation of microtubule dynamics often involves KATANIN (KTN); a microtubule severing enzyme which cuts microtubules to generate new negative ends leading to catastrophic depolymerisation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, KTN is required for the organisation of microtubules in the cell cortex, preprophase band, mitotic spindle and phragmoplast. However, as angiosperms lack MTOCs, the role of KTN in MTOC formation has yet to be studied in plants. Two unique MTOCs - the polar organisers - form on opposing sides of the prophase nucleus in liverworts. Here we show that KTN-mediated microtubule depolymerisation is required for the de novo formation of polar organisers in the liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha. In Mpktn mutants that lack KTN function, the formation, shape, number, and function of polar organisers is defective. This is in addition to defective microtubule organisation in the cell cortex, preprophase band, mitotic spindle, and phragmoplast. These data demonstrate that KTN-mediated microtubule dynamics are required for the formation of liverwort-specific MTOCs.",

    "abstract": "Climate change is leading to warmer winters world-wide with an increasing number of extreme events every year. Plants are majorly impacted by the escalating effects of global warming. In this study, we set up an experimental model to simulate warmer and shorter winters under laboratory conditions. Winter and spring varieties of rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) were subjected to diverse vernalization scenarios including three and four weeks-long vernalization as well as vernalization interruptions by one week-long devernalization at warm temperatures. The aim of the study was to assess the effects of the  vernalization models on BnaFLC (BnaFLCA02, BnaFLCA10 and BnaFLCC02) expression, some yield related traits, a set of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and seed oil content and fatty acid composition. A notable difference in vernalization responsiveness was observed in BnaFLCA02, BnaFLCA10, and BnaFLCC02 between the late-flowering winter variety, Darmor, the early-flowering winter variety Bristol and the spring variety, Helios, after a three-week vernalization period. Our findings unveil a robust correlation between vernalization and seed oil content, as well as fatty acid composition in rapeseed. While the expression levels of fatty acid synthesis-related genes, including BnaFAD2, BnaFAD5, BnaFATB, BnaMCOA (AAE13), and BnaWD40, exhibited significant changes under cold conditions in leaves, the expression levels of the same genes in developing seeds did not exhibit a strong correlation with vernalization, flowering time, or oil and fatty acid contents in seeds. Our results suggest that vernalization plays a role in seed oil biosynthesis beyond its impact on flowering time.",

    "abstract": "Asymmetric expression in the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome refers to the differential expression of genes from A, B, and D parental genomes. Bread wheat is a hexaploid crop with six copies of each chromosome. This complexity can result in unequal expression of genes from each parental genome, leading to asymmetry in gene expression. In other polyploid crops like cotton, transcription factors (TF) exhibit genome-biased expression; however, there are no comparable studies for bread wheat. One of the most prominent TFs families in plants is the basic Leucine Zippers (bZIP) which are eukaryote-specific proteins and regulate various biological processes, including stress-related responses. bZIP proteins are dimeric and several heptads long. They exhibit typical coiled-coil structures with strategically placed amino acids in each heptad, responsible for their stability and specificity. Here, we aim to decipher the structural basis of the asymmetric expression of the bZIP TFs in wheat under low and high-temperature conditions. Furthermore, 19 highly expressed stress-related TabZIP TFs were analysed for their asymmetric expression profiles as plants were exposed to temperature-stress conditions. Two benchmarks were used to analyse the asymmetric gene expression of bZIPs, i.e., a) the promoters occupancy by the epigenetic marker histones, namely, H3K4me3, H3k9ac (active) and H3K27me3 (repressive), b) density and diversity of cis-regulatory elements in the promoters. Notably, the genetic basis of the differences in protein sequences of bZIP triads was explored, which may impart structural stability to a specific homeolog enabling the plant to endure the stress conditions better.",

    "abstract": "Those with diabetes mellitus are at high-risk of developing psychiatric disorders, yet the link between hyperglycemia and alterations in motivated behavior has not been explored in detail. We characterized value-based decision-making behavior of a streptozocin-induced diabetic mouse model on a naturalistic neuroeconomic foraging paradigm called Restaurant Row. Mice made self-paced choices while on a limited time-budget accepting or rejecting reward offers as a function of cost (delays cued by tone-pitch) and subjective value (flavors), tested daily in a closed-economy system across months. We found streptozocin-treated mice disproportionately undervalued less-preferred flavors and inverted their meal-consumption patterns shifted toward a more costly strategy that overprioritized high-value rewards. We discovered these foraging behaviors were driven by impairments in multiple decision-making systems, including the ability to deliberate when engaged in conflict and cache the value of the passage of time in the form of sunk costs. Surprisingly, diabetes-induced changes in behavior depended not only on the type of choice being made but also the salience of reward-scarcity in the environment. These findings suggest complex relationships between glycemic regulation and dissociable valuation algorithms underlying unique cognitive heuristics and sensitivity to opportunity costs can disrupt fundamentally distinct computational processes and could give rise to psychiatric vulnerabilities.",

Here we use an integrative experimental and bioinformatic approach to discover the regulatory relationship between Zic TF binding and changing programs of gene transcription during CGN differentiation.\n\nResultsWe first established a bioinformatic pipeline to integrate Zic ChIP-seq data from the developing mouse cerebellum with other genomic datasets from the same tissue. In newborn CGNs, Zic TF binding predominates at active enhancers that are co-bound by developmentally-regulated TFs including Atoh1, whereas in mature CGNs, Zic TF binding consolidates toward promoters where it co-localizes with activity-regulated TFs. We then performed CUT&RUN-seq in differentiating CGNs to define both the time course of developmental shifts in Zic TF binding and their relationship to gene expression. Mapping Zic TF binding sites to genes using chromatin looping, we identified the set of Zic target genes that have altered expression in RNA-seq from Zic1 or Zic2 knockdown CGNs.\n\nConclusionOur data show that Zic TFs are required for both induction and repression of distinct, developmentally regulated target genes through a mechanism that is largely independent of changes in Zic TF binding. We suggest that the differential collaboration of Zic TFs with other TF families underlies the shift in their biological functions across CGN development.",

    "abstract": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental conditions associated with deficits in social interaction and communication, together with repetitive behaviors. The cell adhesion molecule Protocadherin10 (Pcdh10) has been implicated in the etiology of ASD. Pcdh10 is expressed in the nervous system during embryonic and early postnatal development and has been linked to neural circuit formation. Here, we show strong expression of Pcdh10 in the ganglionic eminences and in the basolateral complex of the amygdala at mid and late embryonic stages, respectively. Both inhibitory and excitatory neurons expressed Pcdh10 in the basolateral complex at perinatal stages and genes linked to vocalization behavior were enriched in Pcdh10- expressing neurons in adult mice. To further investigate the involvement of Pcdh10 in neurodevelopment with relevance to ASD, and to assess the functional and behavioral consequences of loss of Pcdh10 in basolateral amygdala interneurons, we combined a ubiquitous and a conditional Pcdh10 knockout mouse model. Conditional knockout of Pcdh10 reduced the number of interneurons in the basolateral complex. Both models exhibited altered developmental trajectories of socio-affective communication through isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations in neonatal pups, characterized by increased emission rates in heterozygous pups. Furthermore, acoustic call features were affected and heterozygous conditional knockout pups emitted calls characterized by reduced peak frequencies but increased frequency modulation. Additionally, we identified distinct clusters of call subtypes with specific developmental trajectories, suggesting the vocalization repertoire is extensive and dynamic during early life. The nuanced alterations in socio-affective communication at the level of call emission rates, acoustic call features, and clustering of call subtypes were primarily seen in heterozygous pups of the conditional knockout and less prominent in the ubiquitous Pcdh10 knockout, suggesting that changes in anxiety levels associated with Gsh2-lineage interneurons might drive the observed behavioral effects. Together, this demonstrates that loss of Pcdh10 specifically in interneurons contributes to behavioral alterations in socio-affective communication with relevance to ASD.",

Here we use organ-on-chip technology to develop a hiPSC-derived intestinal barrier with apical and basolateral access in a more physiological in vitro microenvironment. To replicate growth factor gradients along the crypt- villus axis, we locally exposed the cells to expansion and differentiation media. In these conditions, intestinal epithelial cells self-organize into villus-like folds with physiological barrier integrity and myofibroblast and neural subtypes emerge and form a layer in the bottom channel underneath the epithelial tissue. The growth factor gradients efficiently balance dividing and mature cell types and induce an intestinal epithelial composition, including absorptive and secretory lineages, resembling the composition of the human adult small intestine. The result is a well-characterized hiPSC-derived intestine-on-chip system that can facilitate personalized studies on physiological processes and therapy development in the human small intestine.",

Here, we report that the empty spiracles homeobox gene 2 (emx2) transcription factor is essential for cilia development across multiple embryonic tissues including the ear, neuromasts and Kupffers vesicle (KV), which establishes left/right axial pattern. emx2 deficient embryos manifest altered fluid homeostasis and kidney defects including decreased multiciliated cells (MCCs), revealing that emx2 is essential to properly establish several renal lineages as well. Further, emx2 deficiency disrupted ciliogenesis on renal monociliated cells and MCCs, and led to aberrant basal body positioning in kidney cells. Interestingly, we discovered that emx2 deficiency was associated with reduced expression of key factors which regulate prostaglandin biosynthesis: the transcriptional regulator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 1 alpha (ppargc1a) and its downstream target prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1 (ptgs1), which encodes a crucial enzyme for production of the prostanoid ligand prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Importantly, both ciliogenesis and renal fate changes were rescued when emx2 deficient embryos were provided with PGE2 or transcripts encoding ptgs1 or ppargc1a. Taken together, our findings reveal new essential roles of emx2 in cilia development across several tissues, and identify emx2 as a critical, novel regulator of prostaglandin biosynthesis during renal development and ciliogenesis.",

Little is known about the propensity of C. albicans to develop BA resistance or tolerance (the ability of a subpopulation to grow slowly in high levels of drug). We evolved 96 replicates from eight diverse C. albicans strains to increasing BA concentrations to test the evolvability of BA resistance and tolerance. Replicate growth was individually assessed daily, with replicates passaged when they had reached an optical density consistent with exponential growth. Many replicates went extinct quickly. Although some replicates could grow in much higher levels of BA than the ancestral strains, evolved populations isolated from the highest terminal BA levels (after 11 weeks of passages) surprisingly showed only modest growth improvements and only at low levels of BA. No large increases in resistance or tolerance were observed in the evolved replicates. Overall, our findings illustrate that there may be evolutionary constraints limiting the emergence of BA resistance and tolerance, which could explain why it remains an effective treatment for recurrent yeast infections.",

    "abstract": "Many pathogens evolve to escape immunity, yet it remains difficult to predict whether immune pressure will lead to diversification, serial replacement of one variant by another, or more complex patterns. Pathogen strain dynamics are mediated by cross-protective immunity, whereby exposure to one strain partially protects against infection by antigenically diverged strains. There is growing evidence that this protection is influenced by early exposures, a phenomenon referred to as original antigenic sin (OAS) or imprinting. In this paper, we derive new constraints on the emergence of the pattern of successive strain replacements demonstrated by influenza, SARS-CoV-2, seasonal coronaviruses, and other pathogens. We find that OAS implies that the limited diversity characteristic of successive strain replacement can only be maintained if R0 is less than a threshold set by the characteristic antigenic distances for cross-protection and for the creation of new immune memory. This bound implies a \"speed limit\" on the evolution of new strains and a minimum variance of the distribution of infecting strains in antigenic space at any time. To carry out this analysis, we develop a theoretical model of pathogen evolution in antigenic space that implements OAS by decoupling the antigenic distances required for protection from infection and strain-specific memory creation. Our results demonstrate that OAS can play an integral role in the emergence of strain structure from host immune dynamics, preventing highly transmissible pathogens from maintaining serial strain replacement without diversification.",

    "abstract": "PremiseThe history of angiosperms is marked by repeated rounds of ancient whole-genome duplications (WGDs). Here we use state of the art methods to provide an up-to-date view of the distribution of WGDs in the history of angiosperms that considers both the uncertainty introduced by inference methods and alternative phylogenetic hypotheses.\n\nMethodsTranscriptomic and genomic data were used to infer and place WGDs across two hypothesized angiosperm phylogenies. Initial WGD hypotheses were made using rate corrections to the distribution of synonymous divergences (Ks) of paralogs and orthologs. WGD hypotheses were tested using syntenic inferences and Bayesian models of duplicate gene gain and loss across the phylogeny.\n\nKey resultsThe number of ancient WGDs in the history of angiosperms ([~]170) is largely similar across different inference methods, but there is often variation in the precise placement of WGDs on the phylogeny. Ks based methods often yield alternative hypothesized WGD placements largely due to variation in substitution rates among lineages. Phylogenetic models of duplicate gene gain and loss are more robust to topological variation, allowing for post hoc testing of WGD hypotheses. However, errors in species tree inference can still produce spurious WGD hypotheses regardless of method used.\n\nConclusionsHere we show that different WGD inference methods largely agree on an average of 3.5 WGD in the history of angiosperm species. However, the precise placement of WGDs on the phylogeny is subject to the inference method and tree topology. As researchers continue to test hypotheses regarding the impacts ancient WGDs have on angiosperm evolution, it is important to consider the uncertainty of the phylogeny as well as WGD inference methods.",

    "abstract": "The cGAS-STING pathway detects cytosolic DNA and activates a signaling cascade that results in a type I interferon (IFN) response. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated exonuclease TREX1 suppresses cGAS-STING by eliminating DNA from the cytosol. Mutations that compromise TREX1 function are linked to autoinflammatory disorders, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (AGS). Despite key roles in regulating cGAS-STING and suppressing excessive inflammation, the impact of many disease-associated TREX1 mutations - particularly those outside of the core catalytic domains - remains poorly understood. Here, we characterize a recessive AGS-linked TREX1 P61Q mutation occurring within the poorly characterized polyproline helix (PPII) motif. In keeping with its position outside of the catalytic core or ER targeting motifs, neither the P61Q mutation, nor aggregate proline-to-alanine PPII mutation, disrupt TREX1 exonuclease activity, subcellular localization, or cGAS-STING regulation in overexpression systems. Introducing targeted mutations into the endogenous TREX1 locus revealed that PPII mutations destabilize the protein, resulting in impaired exonuclease activity and unrestrained cGAS-STING activation. Overall, these results demonstrate that TREX1 PPII mutations, including P61Q, impair proper immune regulation and lead to autoimmune disease through TREX1 destabilization.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWe recently identified tandem repeats of GGN triplets as a sequence motif strongly enriched in the DNA replication origins (ORIs) of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, where it correlates with the ORI strength quantified through short nascent strands sequencing.\n\nResultsHere we show that clusters of four or more GGN repeats separated by short tracts (<7 nucleotides) are present in more than 65% ORIs of six model eukaryotic organisms: Leishmania major, Arabidopsis thaliana, Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster, Mus musculus and Homo sapiens. The measured percentages vary with the experimental technique adopted for ORI determination. For all studied techniques and organisms, ORIs are significantly prone to be located within or near strong GGN clusters, although these are neither necessary nor sufficient for ORI activation. Interestingly, for same experimental technique, the association between ORIs and GGN clusters was stronger al later developmental stages for all organisms for which we could perform this comparison.\n\nIn accordance with a biophysical model of nucleosome positioning, the GGN clusters strongly favor nucleosome occupancy. At the same time, both GGN clusters and ORIs occur frequently within 1kb from nucleosome-depleted regions (NDR). We propose a structural model based on chromatin secondary structure in which the NDR and the well-positioned nucleosome at the GGN are close in space, which may favor functional interactions. We hypothesize that the presence of GGN at ORIs arose in part for promoting the above nucleosome organization Moreover, at least in Arabidopsis, the replication protein CDC6 is very strongly associated with GGN clusters.\n\nNMR experiments showed that clusters of at least four GGN can form G-quadruplex (G4) in vitro. Our data support the view that GGN clusters are formed through the interplay of mutational processes (GC skew at ORIs plus triplet expansion), and that similar mutational processes, i.e. AT skew at transcription start sites (TSS) and ORIs, might facilitate the formation of the NDR, thus favoring the evolvability of chromatin.\n\nConclusionsGGN clusters are easily evolvable sequence motifs enriched at ORIs of eukaryotic genomes. They favor G4 secondary structure and a nucleosome organization that may unify the apparent discrepancy between ORIs of higher eukaryotes and yeast.",

    "abstract": "Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) is one of the most important enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Genetic polymorphism can influence drug metabolism by CYP2D6 such that a therapy is seriously affected by under- or overdosing of drugs. However, a general explanation at the atomistic level for poor activity is missing so far. Here we show for the 20 most common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of CYP2D6 that poor metabolism is driven by four mechanisms. We found in extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations that the rigidity of the I-helix (central helix), distance between central phenylalanines (stabilizing bound substrate), availability of basic residues on the surface of CYP2D6 (binding of Cytochrome P450 reductase), and position of arginine 132 (electron transfer to heme) are essential for an extensive function of the enzyme. These results were applied to SNPs with unknown effects and potential SNPs that may lead to poor drug metabolism were identified. The revealed molecular mechanisms might be important for other drug-metabolizing Cytochrome P450 enzymes.\n\nTable of Contents Graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=80 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/574226v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@517961org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f7ded3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1462baaorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dcabae_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The feeding/fasting cycles controlled by our circadian clock impose great daily metabolic and physiological changes, and yet investigations into the consequences of metabolic deficiencies, either dietary or genetic, have often ignored the time of day or the circadian time of the animals or subjects. In addition, these deficiencies may themselves disrupt our circadian clock, causing secondary metabolic, physiological and behavioural disorders.\n\nDietary methionine/choline deficiency in rodents is a common model for human non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, but methionine and choline are nutrients essential for many other processes beyond fatty acid synthesis in the liver, including biological methylations and 1-carbon metabolism, regulation of translation notably via the mTOR pathway, phospholipid synthesis, polyamine pathway and glutathione synthesis.\n\nWe have previously shown that circadian rhythms in many organisms are highly sensitive to deficiency or excesses of 1-carbon metabolites. Using a methionine/choline deficient diet in mice, we illustrate the nutrigenomic crosstalk between circadian rhythms and 1-carbon metabolism. We show not only that circadian locomotor activity behaviour is profoundly, rapidly and reversibly affected by methionine/choline deficiency, but also that the effects of methionine/choline deficiency on gene expression and 1-carbon metabolites are dependent on circadian time, illustrating the importance of considering circadian rhythms in metabolic studies. This study also highlights the impact of what we eat, or dont, on our behaviour and biological rhythms.",

After designing single-input RNA sensors with activation ratios beyond our detection limits, we created logic gates, including challenging XOR and XNOR gates, and sensors that respond to the ratio of two inputs. Finally, we describe the OpenTB challenge, which elicited 85-nucleotide sensors that compute a score for diagnosing active tuberculosis, based on the ratio of products of three gene segments. Building on OpenTB design strategies, we created an algorithm Nucleologic that produces similarly compact sensors for the three-gene score based on RNA and DNA.

    "abstract": "Immune imprinting is a phenomenon in which an individuals prior antigenic experiences influence responses to subsequent infection or vaccination. Here, using antibody depletion and multiplexed spike-binding assays, we characterized the type-specificity and cross-reactivity of serum antibody responses after mRNA vaccination in mice and human clinical trial participants. In mice, a single priming dose of a preclinical version of mRNA-1273 vaccine encoding Wuhan-1 spike minimally imprinted serum responses elicited by Omicron boosters, enabling a robust generation of type-specific antibodies. However, substantial imprinting was observed in mice receiving an Omicron booster after two priming doses of mRNA-1273, an effect that was mitigated by a second booster dose of Omicron mRNA vaccine. In humans who received two BA.5 or XBB.1.5 Omicron-matched boosters after two or more doses of the prototype mRNA-1273 vaccine, spike-binding and neutralizing serum antibodies cross-reacted with circulating Omicron variants as well as more distantly related sarbecoviruses. Because the serum neutralizing response against Omicron strains and other sarbecoviruses was completely abrogated after pre-clearing with the Wuhan-1 spike protein, antibodies induced by XBB.1.5 boosting in humans focus on conserved epitopes shaped and shared by the antecedent mRNA-1273 primary series. Our depletion analysis also identified cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and S2 proteins with differential inhibitory effects on members of the sarbecovirus subgenus. Thus, although the serum antibody response to Omicron-based boosters in humans is dominantly imprinted by prior immunizations with prototype mRNA-1273 vaccines, this outcome can be beneficial as it drives expansion of multiple classes of cross-neutralizing antibodies that inhibit infection of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and extend activity to distantly related sarbecoviruses.",

    "abstract": "Urban particulate matter (uPM) poses significant health risks, particularly to the respiratory system. Fine particles, such as PM2.5, can penetrate deep into the lungs and exacerbate a range of health problems, including emphysema, asthma, and lung cancer. PM exposure is also linked to extra-pulmonary disorders like heart and neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, prolonged exposure to elevated PM levels can reduce overall life expectancy. Senescence is a dysfunctional cell state typically associated with age but can also be precipitated by environmental stressors. This study aimed to determine whether uPM could drive senescence in macrophages, an essential cell type involved in particulate phagocytosis-mediated clearance. While it is known that uPM exposure impairs immune function, this deficit is multi-faceted and incompletely understood, partly due to the use of particulates such as diesel exhaust particle (DEP) as a surrogate for true uPM. uPM was collected from several locations in the USA, including Baltimore, Houston, and Phoenix. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were stimulated with uPM or reference particulates (e.g., DEP) to assess senescence-related parameters. We report that uPM-exposed BMDMs adopt a senescent phenotype characterized by increased IL-1 secretion, senescence- associated {beta}-galactosidase activity, and diminished proliferation. Exposure to allergens failed to elicit such a response, supporting a distinction between different types of environmental exposures. uPM-induced senescence was independent of key macrophage activation pathways, specifically inflammasome and scavenger receptor. However, inhibition of the phagolysosome pathway abrogated senescence markers, supporting this phenotypes attribution to uPM phagocytosis. These data suggest uPM exposure leads to macrophage senescence, which may contribute to immunopathology.",

    "abstract": "The Type VI secretion system (T6SS) serves as a crucial molecular weapon in interbacterial competition and significantly influences cell-cell interactions. Various bacterial species utilize their T6SSs to execute a multitude of functions, dictated by their ecological niche. However, the characteristics of T6SS in clinical Klebsiella pneumoniae, a common opportunistic nosocomial pathogen, have not been fully elucidated. Here, we conducted a genomic analysis of 65 clinical K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from patients with varying infections. Genes encoding a T6SS cluster were present in all analyzed strains of K. pneumoniae. Strains of identical sequence type (ST) carried structurally and numerically identical T6SS. Our study also highlights the importance of selecting conserved regions in key T6SS genes for effective primer design in PCR identification. We then utilized the predominant ST11 K. pneumoniae HS11286 to investigate the effect of knocking out T6SS marker genes hcp or vgrG. Transcriptome analysis identified a total of 1,298 co-upregulated and 1,752 co-downregulated differentially expressed genes. Additionally, the absence of hcp or vgrG gene suppressed the expression of other T6SS-related genes within the locus I cluster. Pathway analysis showed that the {Delta}hcp mutant exhibited alterations in transport, establishment of localization, localization and cell processes. Furthermore, interbacterial competition experiments showed that hcp and vgrG are essential for competitive ability of ST11 K. pneumoniae HS11286. This study furthers our understanding of the genomic characteristics of T6SS in K. pneumoniae and suggested that the involvement of multiple genes in T6SS of strain HS11286.\n\nImportanceGram-negative bacteria use T6SS to deliver effectors that interact with neighboring cells for niche advantage. K. pneumoniae is an opportunistic nosocomial pathogen that often carriers multiple T6SS loci, the function of which has not yet been elucidated. We performed a genomic analysis of 65 clinical K. pneumoniae strains isolated from various sources, confirming that all strains contained T6SS. We then used transcriptomics to further study changes in gene expression and effect upon interbacterial competition following knockout of key T6SS genes in ST11 K. pneumoniae HS11286. Our findings revealed the distribution and genomic characteristics of T6SS in clinical K. pneumoniae. This study also described the overall transcriptional changes in the predominant Chinese ST11 strain HS11286 upon deletion of crucial T6SS genes.

Yet, the factors affecting microbial communities associated with wild species often remain uncharacterized. For example, the impact of the hosts habitat degradation due to anthropogenic activities has received little attention, which contrasts with the large literature showing how such habitat degradation is at least partly responsible for the on-going global patterns of macro-biodiversity erosion. Here, we use metacommunities of herbivorous insect species specialized in feeding on Plantago lanceolata in the fragmented landscape of the [A]land Islands, Finland, as a model system to test whether and how bacterial communities associated with wild species change along a gradient of habitat degradation. We evaluated microbial species diversity and community composition in two sympatric insect species sampled from local meadow habitats with various levels of human disturbance within or around these habitats (e.g. forests, roads, agriculture fields, buildings). Counter to our expectations, we found that bacterial diversity can increase with habitat degradation, with individuals from more degraded habitats hosting more rare bacterial species. In contrast, as the dominant microbial species remain similar across habitats, the community composition and function of the microbiota persist under habitat degradation. In this system, the strength of human activities might induce changes in habitat heterogeneity rather than changes in overall habitat quality, thus allowing local insects to encounter and host more rare microbes rather than trigger local microbial extinction.",

    "abstract": "The majority of bacteria use cobamides as cofactors for methionine synthesis or other diverse metabolic processes. Cobamides are a structurally diverse family of cofactors related to vitamin B12 (cobalamin), and most bacteria studied to date grow most robustly with particular cobamides. Because different environments contain varying abundances of distinct cobamides, bacteria are likely to encounter cobamides that do not function efficiently for their metabolism. Here, we performed a laboratory evolution of a cobamide-dependent strain of Escherichia coli with pseudocobalamin (pCbl), a cobamide that E. coli uses less effectively than cobalamin for MetH-dependent methionine synthesis, to identify genetic adaptations that lead to improved growth with less-preferred cobamides. After propagating and sequencing nine independent lines and validating the results by constructing targeted mutations, we found that increasing expression of the outer membrane cobamide transporter BtuB is beneficial during growth under cobamide-limiting conditions. Unexpectedly, we also found that overexpression of the cobamide adenosyltransferase BtuR confers a specific growth advantage in pCbl. Characterization of this phenotype revealed that BtuR and adenosylated cobamides contribute to optimal MetH-dependent growth. Together, these findings improve our understanding of how bacteria expand their cobamide-dependent metabolic potential.\n\nImportanceIn nature, bacteria commonly experience fluctuations in the availability of required nutrients. Thus, their environment often contains nutrients that are insufficient in quantity or that function poorly in their metabolism. Cobamides, the vitamin B12 family of cofactors, are ideal for investigating the influence of nutrient quantity and structure on bacterial growth because they must be acquired exogenously by most bacteria and are structurally diverse, with most bacteria having preferences for certain types. We performed a laboratory evolution experiment in E. coli with a less-preferred cobamide to examine whether and how bacteria can improve their growth with less ideal nutrients. We found that overexpression of genes for cobamide uptake and modification are genetic adaptations that enable better growth under these conditions. Given that cobamides are key shared metabolites in microbial communities, our results reveal insights into bacterial interactions and competition for nutrients.",

    "abstract": "Single-stranded DNA gaps are postulated to be fundamental to the mechanism of anti-cancer drugs. Gaining insights into their induction could therefore be pivotal for advancing therapeutic strategies. For poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi) to be effective, the presence of FANCJ helicase is required. However, the relationship between FANCJ dependent gaps and PARP1 catalytic inhibition or trapping--both linked to PARPi toxicity in BRCA deficient cells--is yet to be elucidated. Here, we find that the efficacy of PARPi is contingent on S-phase PARP1 activity, which is compromised in FANCJ deficient cells because PARP1, along with MSH2, is \"sequestered\" by G-quadruplexes. PARP1s replication activity is also diminished in cells missing a FANCJ-MLH1 interaction, but in such cells, depleting MSH2 can release sequestered PARP1, restoring PARPi-induced gaps and sensitivity. Our observations indicate that sequestered and trapped PARP1 are different chromatin-bound forms, with FANCJ loss increasing PARPi resistance in cells susceptible to canonical PARP1 trapping. However, in BRCA1 null cells, the loss of FANCJ mirrors the effects of PARP1 loss or inhibition, with the common detrimental factor being the loss of PARP1 activity during DNA replication, not trapping. These insights underline the crucial role of PARP1 activity during DNA replication in BRCA deficient cells and emphasize the importance of understanding drug mechanisms for enhancing precision medicine.",

    "abstract": "Apical-out organoids produced through eversion triggered by extra-organoid extracellular matrix (ECM) removal or degradation are generally small, structurally variable, and limited for viral infection and therapeutics testing. This work describes ECM-encapsulating, stably-inverted apical-out human upper airway organoids (AORBs) that are large ([~]500 {micro}m diameter), consistently spherical, recapitulate in vivo-like cellular heterogeneity, and maintain their inverted morphology for over 60 days. Treatment of AORBs with IL-13 skews differentiation towards goblet cells and the apical-out geometry allows extra-organoid mucus collection. AORB maturation for 14 days induces strong co-expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 to allow high-yield infection with five SARS-CoV-2 variants. Dose-response analysis of three well-studied SARS-CoV-2 antiviral compounds [remdesivir, bemnifosbuvir (AT-511), and nirmatrelvir] shows AORB antiviral assays to be comparable to gold-standard air-liquid interface cultures, but with higher throughput ([~]10-fold) and fewer cells ([~]100-fold). While this work focuses on SARS-CoV-2 applications, the consistent AORB shape and size, and one-organoid-per-well modularity broadly impacts in vitro human cell model standardization efforts in line with economic imperatives and recently updated FDA regulation on therapeutic testing.",

Because our model successfully replicates the observed properties of both wild-type yeast cells and many mutant strains, it provides a reasonable, validated starting point for more comprehensive stochastic-Boolean models of cell cycle controls.

    "abstract": "The taxonomic status of the neotropical bat genus Trachops has been reevaluated through an integrated study that incorporates morphological, morphometric, and molecular data across its extensive geographic range. Our research, which included previously unexamined regions, revealed substantial insights into the diversity within Trachops. The results support the elevation of T. cirrhosus ehrhardti to species status, due to genetic and morphological differences in southeastern Brazil specimens. Conversely, our comprehensive analysis found insufficient evidence to maintain the subspecific distinction of T. c. coffini, which lacks diagnosable morphological characters and is not genetically distinct from T. c. cirrhosus across its distribution range. Additionally, our findings challenge the previous belief of a latitudinal differentiation in body size for Trachops cirrhosus, as specimens from western South America and northeastern South America exhibit similar sizes to those from Central America. These results underscore the importance of revising the taxonomic framework for this bat genus, contributing to a more precise understanding of its evolutionary relationships, and further enhancing conservation efforts, considering the potential threats to the newly recognized T. ehrhardti in the imperiled Atlantic Forest of Brazil.",

    "abstract": "The few availability of antivirals for new strains of highly pathogenic viruses has become a serious public health problem that leads to the death of thousands of people annually. For this reason, the search for new products against these agents has become an urgent need. Many studies have been carried out with this aim. Among the multiple sources of research for new antibiotics and antivirals, bioprospecting for molecules obtained from invertebrates, or their products, has become an increasingly frequent option. Arthropods appeared on the planet around 350 million years ago and have been one of the beings with the greatest adaptability and resistance. Invertebrates have been found in all known ecosystems. Their survival for so long, in such different environments, is an indication that they have a very efficient protection system against environmental infections, despite not having a developed immune system like mammals. Historically, products obtained mainly from bees, such as honey and propolis, have been shown to be of great pharmacologica l importance, being used as antimicrobials, anti-inflammatory, antitumor, healing and several other functions. However, these molecules have also been obtained from other invertebra tes, such as caterpillars and spiders. Previous studies by our group have demonstrated an intense antiviral and antimicrobial activity of these materials. In this study, we identified, isolated and characterized compounds with potent antiviral effect against avian Coronavirus in propolis from Scaptotrigona aff postica, hemolymph of Lonomia obliqua and from mygalin, an acylpolyamine, isolated from hemocytes of spider Acanthoscurria gomesiana. The antiviral assay was carried out by reducing infectious foci in cultures of infected cells and treated with these differents substances obtained from invertebrates. Propolis and crude hemolymph reduced avian coronavirus by an average of 256 x when used at a concentration of 5% v/v and an average reduction of 8x when 160{micro}M of Mygalin was used. Propolis purified and sinthetic hemolymph reduced the virus titer by an average 64 fold. The virus reduction with synthetic mygalin, at a concentration of 26 uM, was average of 16 times. The antiviral responses of the 3 substances were dose dependent. By the other hand, the virus titer reduction was 2 times more intense when the substances were added 1 hour before cell infection with the virus. The chemical characterization of the elements present in the extracts was carried out by liquid chromatography.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOlder adults have difficulty maintaining side-to-side balance while navigating daily environments. Losing balance in such circumstances can lead to falls. We need to better understand how older adults adapt lateral balance to navigate environment-imposed task constraints.\n\nResearch QuestionHow do older adults adjust mediolateral balance while walking along continually-narrowing paths, and what are the stability implications of these adjustments?\n\nMethodsEighteen older (71.6{+/-}6.0 years) and twenty younger (21.7{+/-}2.6 years) healthy adults traversed 25m-long paths that gradually narrowed from 45cm to 5cm. Participants switched onto an adjacent path when they chose. We quantified participants lateral center-of-mass dynamics and lateral Margins of Stability (MoSL) as paths narrowed. We quantified lateral Probability of Instability (PoIL) as the cumulative probability that participants would take a laterally unstable (MoSL<0) step as they walked. We also extracted these outcomes where participants switched paths.\n\nResultsAs paths narrowed, all participants exhibited progressively smaller average MoSL and increasingly larger PoIL. However, their MoSL variability was largest at both the narrowest and widest path sections. Older adults exhibited consistently both larger average and more variable MoSL across path widths. Taken into account together, these resulted in either comparable or somewhat larger PoIL as paths narrowed. Older adults left the narrowing paths sooner, on average, than younger. As they did so, older adults exhibited significantly larger average and more variable MoSL, but somewhat smaller PoIL than younger.\n\nSignificanceOur results directly challenge the predominant interpretation that larger average MoSL as indicating \"greater stability\", which we argue is inconsistent with the principles underlying its derivation. In contrast, analyzing step-to-step gait dynamics, together with estimating PoIL allows one to properly quantify instability risk. Furthermore, the adaptive strategies uncovered using these methods suggest potential targets for future interventions to reduce falls in older adults.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe active functionalities of RNA are recognized to heavily dependent on the structure and sequence. Therefore, A model that can accurately evaluate a design by giving RNA sequence-structure pairs would be a valuable tool for many researchers. Machine learning methods have been explored to develop such tools, showing promising results. However, two key issues remain. Firstly, the performance of machine learning models is affected by the features used to characterize RNA. Currently, there is no consensus on which features are the most effective for characterizing RNA sequence-structure pairs. Secondly, most existing machine learning methods extract features describing entire RNA molecule. We argue that it is essential to define additional features that characterize nucleotides and specific sections of RNA structure to enhance the overall efficacy of the RNA design process.\n\nResultsWe develop two deep learning models for evaluating RNA sequence-structure pairs. The first model, NU-ResNet, uses a convolutional neural network architecture that solves the aforementioned problems by explicitly encoding RNA sequence-structure information into a 3D matrix. Building upon NU-ResNet, our second deep learning model, NUMO-ResNet, incorporates additional information derived from the characterizations of RNA, specifically the 2D folding motifs. In this work, we introduce an automated method to extract these motifs based on fundamental secondary structure descriptions. To assess the robustness of our models, we conduct 10-fold cross validation. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of both models on two independent testing datasets. Our proposed models demonstrate excellent performance across both datasets and surpass the performance of the ENTRNA approach.\n\nAvailability and ImplementationThe corresponding source code and data for this research is available at https://github.com/yzhou617/NU-ResNet_and_NUMO-ResNet.\n\nContactGiulia.Pedrielli@asu.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "All coronaviruses (CoVs) encode for a conserved macrodomain (Mac1) located in nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3). Mac1 is an ADP-ribosylhydrolase that binds and hydrolyzes mono-ADP-ribose from target proteins. Previous work has shown that Mac1 is important for virus replication and pathogenesis. Within Mac1, there are several regions that are highly conserved across CoVs, including the GIF (glycine-isoleucine-phenylalanine) motif. To determine how the biochemical activities of these residues impact CoV replication, the isoleucine and the phenylalanine residues were mutated to alanine (I-A/F-A) in both recombinant Mac1 proteins and recombinant CoVs, including murine hepatitis virus (MHV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The F-A mutant proteins had ADP-ribose binding and/or hydrolysis defects that led to attenuated replication and pathogenesis in cell culture and mice. In contrast, the I-A mutations had normal enzyme activity and enhanced ADP-ribose binding. Despite increased ADP-ribose binding, I-A mutant MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were highly attenuated in both cell culture and mice, indicating that this isoleucine residue acts as a gate that controls ADP-ribose binding for efficient virus replication. These results highlight the function of this highly conserved residue and provide unique insight into how macrodomains control ADP-ribose binding and hydrolysis to promote viral replication and pathogenesis.",
