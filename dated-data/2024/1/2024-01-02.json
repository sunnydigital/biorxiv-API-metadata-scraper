    "abstract": "Hymenoptera have some of the highest diversity and number of individuals among insects. Many of these species potentially play key roles as food sources, pest controllers, and pollinators. However, little is known about their diversity and biology, and about 80% of the species have not been described yet. Classical taxonomy based on morphology is a rather slow process, but DNA barcoding has already brought considerable progress in identification. Innovative methods such as image-based identification and automation can even further speed up the process. We present a proof of concept for image data recognition of a parasitic wasp family, the Diapriidae (Hymenoptera), obtained as part of the GBOL III project. These tiny (1.2 - 4.5 mm) wasps were photographed and identified using DNA barcoding to provide a solid ground truth for training a neural network. Subsequently, three different neural network architectures were trained, evaluated, and optimized. As a result, 11 different classes of diaprids and one class of \"other Hymenoptera  can be classified with an average accuracy of 96%. Additionally, the sex of the specimen can be classified automatically with an accuracy of > 96%.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) remains a complex challenge characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Genetic variations have emerged as crucial players in the etiology of AD, enabling hope for a better understanding of the disease mechanisms; yet the specific mechanism of action for those genetic variants remain uncertain. Animal models with reminiscent disease pathology could uncover previously uncharacterized roles of these genes. Using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing, we generated a knockout model for abca7, orthologous to human ABCA7 - an established AD-risk gene. The abca7+/- zebrafish showed reduced astroglial proliferation, synaptic density, and microglial abundance in response to amyloid beta 42 (A{beta}42). Single-cell transcriptomics revealed abca7-dependent neuronal and glial cellular crosstalk through neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling. The abca7 knockout reduced the expression of npy, bdnf and ngfra, which are required for synaptic integrity and astroglial proliferation. With clinical data in humans, we showed reduced NPY in AD correlates with elevated Braak stage, predicted regulatory interaction between NPY and BDNF, identified genetic variants in NPY associated with AD, found segregation of variants in ABCA7, BDNF and NGFR in AD families, and discovered epigenetic changes in the promoter regions of NPY, NGFR and BDNF in humans with specific single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCA7. These results suggest that ABCA7-dependent NPY signaling is required for synaptic integrity, the impairment of which generates a risk factor for AD through compromised brain resilience.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=197 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573893v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (73K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@eecf7forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@78d8e0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e65d71org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@100db01_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Dysregulation of energy balance leading to obesity is a significant risk factor for cardiometabolic diseases such as diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and atherosclerosis. In rodents and a number of other vertebrates, feeding has been shown to induce a rapid rise in the intestinal levels of N-acyl-ethanolamines (NAEs) and the chronic consumption of a high fat diet abolishes this rise. Administering NAEs to rodents consuming a high fat diet reduces their adiposity, in part by reducing food intake and enhancing fat oxidation, so that feeding-induced intestinal NAE biosynthesis appears to be critical to appropriate regulation of energy balance. However, the contribution of feeding-induced intestinal NAE biosynthesis to appropriate energy balance remains poorly understood because the specific enzymes responsible for feeding-induced NAE biosynthesis have not been identified. The rate-limiting step in the intestinal biosynthesis of NAEs is formation of their immediate precursors, the N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), by phosphatidylethanolamine N-acyltransferases (NATs). At least six NATs are found in humans and multiple homologs of these NATs are found in most vertebrate species. In recent years, the fecundity and small size of zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as their similarities in feeding behavior and energy balance regulation with mammals, have led to their use to model key features of cardiometabolic disease. We therefore searched the Danio rerio genome to identify all NAT homologs and found two additional NAT homologs besides the previously reported plaat1, rarres3, and rarres3l, and used CRISPR/cas9 to delete these two NAT homologs (plaat1l1 and plaat1l2). While wild-type fish markedly increased their intestinal NAPE and NAE levels in response to a meal after fasting, this response was completely ablated in plaat1l1-/- fish. Furthermore, plaat1l1-/-fish fed a standard flake diet had increased weight gain and glucose intolerance compared to wild-type fish. The results support a critical role for feeding-induced NAE biosynthesis in regulating energy balance and suggest that restoring this response in obese animals could potentially be used to treat obesity and cardiometabolic disease.",

    "abstract": "The fabrication of microfluidic devices has progressed from cleanroom manufacturing to replica molding in polymers, and more recently to direct manufacturing by subtractive (e.g., laser machining) and additive (e.g., 3D printing) techniques, notably digital light processing (DLP) photopolymerization. However, many methods require technical expertise and while DLP 3D printers remain expensive at a cost [~]15-30K USD with [~]8M pixels that are 25-40 {micro}m in size. Here, we introduce (i) the use of low-cost ([~]150-600 USD) liquid crystal display (LCD) photopolymerization 3D printing with [~]8M-58M pixels that are 18-35 {micro}m in size for direct microfluidic device fabrication and (ii) a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate-based ink developed for LCD 3D printing (PLInk). We optimized PLInk for high resolution, fast 3D printing and biocompatibility while considering the illumination inhomogeneity and low power density of LCD 3D printers. We made lateral features as small as 75 {micro}m, 22-{micro}m-thick embedded membranes, and circular channels with a 110 {micro}m radius. We 3D printed microfluidic devices previously manufactured by other methods, including an embedded 3D micromixer, a membrane microvalve, and an autonomous capillaric circuit (CC) deployed for interferon-{gamma} detection with excellent performance (limit of detection: 12 pg mL-1, CV: 6.8%), and we demonstrated compatibility with cell culture. Finally, large area manufacturing was illustrated by printing 42 CCs with embedded microchannels in <45 min. LCD 3D printing together with tailored inks pave the way for democratizing access to high-resolution manufacturing of ready-to-use microfluidic devices by anyone, anywhere.",

    "abstract": "The electrocardiogram (ECG) records heart-beats and is potentially life-saving. However, the ECG signals (e.g., recorded by the standard ECG monitoring system or the Holter ECG monitoring system) heavily suffered from the noises. Thus, the recorded signals involve meaningful cardiac deflections, other biological waves (e.g., caused by the muscle or electrode movements), and even some noises from the monitoring devices (e.g., the power cables). These noise sources would result in inaccurate analyses of cardiac diseases, thus requiring the ECG de-noising methods in data pre-processing phase before the diagnoses. Previous work provided various ECG de-noising approaches, typically based on some filter algorithms or some wave decomposition algorithms. Most of these approaches did not profoundly consider the ECG signals specific data structure, and were not adaptive to the signals recorded by various devices or different skin electrodes. Inspired by the ECG recording theory, we find it available to extract noise information from noisy ECG signals directly. We propose a new ECG de-noising method implemented by the neural network, which de-noise the ECG signals without the supervision of the clean signals. The procedure in the self-supervision is straightforward: we first estimate and simulate the noise signals according to the given noisy ECG signals, and then \"subtract\" the simulated noises to obtain the de-noised ECG signals by the neural network. Experiments on a public dataset verify that our approach is adaptive to ECG signals from different patients and devices. Also, it is proven that the classification on the ECG signals de-noised by the proposed de-noising methods outperforms those with the traditional de-noising methods.",

Building off currently known breast cancer oncogenes and SNPs, we identify the subset of SNPs with pleiotropic effects, with the goal of identifying mutations functionally relevant to disease progression. We further use sequence and structure analysis to prioritize missense mutations most likely to impact protein function.\n\nResultsFrom the known breast cancer SNPs, we identified co-associated mutations located at evolutionarily conserved positions and contributing significant protein stability as potential focal points for disease biomarkers, protein function studies, and therapeutic intervention. To identify regions likely integral to protein function, we plotted genomic intervals where multiple disease density peaks overlap. Of the breast cancer SNPs, 1,714 were co-associated in-frame mutations, of which 930 occurred at conserved residue positions (Shannon Entropy <1.0) and 833 were also missense mutations. Building structure-based models of the 277 SNPs with available protein structure resulted in identification of 133 SNPs that are calculated to affect protein thermostability by >100-fold (>3 kcal/mol). The workflow we built can be applied to other diseases to help identify functional mutations.\n\nAvailabilityPython code for the integrated analysis workflow available at http://github.com/mcarpenter-brandeis/brc-pleiotropy and detailed data tables available in Supplemental Information.\n\nContactacheng@brandeis.edu, meredith.a.carpenter@gmail.coms",

    "abstract": "The most common type of protein secondary structure after the alpha helix and beta sheet is the beta turn, in which the backbone (BB) chain abruptly changes direction over four amino acid residues. Existing tools for the study of beta turns characterize their structures exclusively in the Ramachandran space of BB dihedral angles, which presents challenges for the visualization, comparison and analysis of the wide range of turn geometries. A recent study has introduced a turn-local Euclidean-space coordinate system and global alignment for turns, along with geometric parameters describing their bulk BB shape, and these features and others are incorporated here into ExploreTurns, a tool specialized for the exploration, analysis, geometric tuning and retrieval of beta turns and their associated motifs which combines the advantages of Ramachandran- and Euclidean-space representations. ExploreTurns is a database selection screen, structure profiler and 3D viewer, integrated onto a single web page, that renders a redundancy-screened, PDB-derived dataset of turns and their contexts structurally addressable by a wide range of criteria. The tool is applied here to identify new types of beta-bulge loops satisfying a proposed generalized definition, discover other short H-bonded loops and demonstrate a new nomenclature that classifies all such structures, map Asx N-cap sequence preferences, profile Schellman loop/turn conformations, and analyze the depth dependence of beta-turn geometry, and it should prove useful in research, education, and applications such as protein design, in which the ability to identify, profile and tune turn and motif structures suited to particular requirements may improve performance.",

However, clinical response varies widely and robust predictive biomarkers for patient stratification are lacking. Here, we characterize early on-treatment proteomic changes in blood plasma to gain a better understanding of treatment response and resistance.\n\nMethodsPre-treatment (T0) and on-treatment (T1) plasma samples were collected from 225 NSCLC patients receiving PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor-based regimens. Plasma was profiled using aptamer-based technology to quantify approximately 7000 plasma proteins per sample. Proteins displaying significant fold changes (T1:T0) were analyzed further to identify associations with clinical outcomes. Bioinformatic analyses of upregulated proteins were performed to determine potential cell origins and enriched biological processes.\n\nResultsThe levels of 142 proteins were significantly increased in the plasma of NSCLC patients following ICI-based treatments. Soluble PD-1 exhibited the highest increase, with a positive correlation to tumor PD-L1 status. Bioinformatic analysis of the ICI monotherapy dataset revealed a set of 30 upregulated proteins that formed a single, highly interconnected network with CD8A serving as a central hub, suggesting T cell activation during ICI treatment. Notably, the T cell-related network was detected regardless of clinical benefit. Lastly, circulating proteins of alveolar origin were identified as potential biomarkers of limited clinical benefit, possibly due to a link with cellular stress and lung damage.\n\nConclusionsOur study provides insights into the biological processes activated during ICI-based therapy, highlighting the potential of plasma proteomics to identify mechanisms of therapy resistance and potential biomarkers for outcome.",

    "abstract": "Chicory roots produce inulin, a dietary fiber, as well as large quantities of bitter sesquiterpene lactones (STLs), which have valuable biological activities. In an effort to understand the compartmentalization of metabolism within chicory roots and the molecular basis of the development of laticifers that produce the chicory latex, we performed metabolomics and transcriptomics profiling. GC-MS and LC-MS identified a total of 22 580 features of which 135 were differentially abundant between cell types. Further analysis indicated that the major STLs accumulated primarily in the latex. Gene expression of known STL pathway genes indicates a compartmentalization of the biosynthesis across multiple tissues, with implications regarding the trafficking of pathway intermediates. Phytohormone measurements and gene expression analysis point to a major role for jasmonate signaling in the development and differentiation of laticifers. Furthermore, inulin accumulates mostly outside the laticifers but expression of inulin metabolic genes also point to a complex distribution and trafficking of inulin or inulin precursors across different root compartments. Altogether, the data presented here constitute a unique resource to investigate several biological processes in chicory roots, including laticifer development, STL biosynthesis and transport and inulin biosynthesis regulation.\n\nSignificance statementA combination of transcriptomics, targeted and untargeted metabolomics of different tissues of chicory roots was generated. These data constitute a resource basis for the investigation of various processes taking place in chicory taproots, including sesquiterpene lactone biosynthesis, laticifer development and inulin biosynthesis and trafficking.",

    "abstract": "In the central nervous system, triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) is exclusively expressed by microglia and is critical for microglial proliferation, migration, and phagocytosis. TREM2 plays an important role in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimers disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, little is known about the role TREM2 plays in epileptogenesis. To investigate this, we utilized TREM2 knockout (KO) mice within the murine intra-amygdala kainic acid seizure model. Electroencephalographic analysis, immunocytochemistry, and RNA sequencing revealed that TREM2 deficiency significantly promoted seizure-induced pathology. We found that TREM2 KO increased both acute status epilepticus and spontaneous recurrent seizures characteristic of chronic focal epilepsy. Mechanistically, phagocytic clearance of damaged neurons by microglia was impaired in TREM2 KO mice and the reduced phagocytic capacity correlated with increased spontaneous seizures. Analysis of human tissue from patients who underwent surgical resection for drug resistant temporal lobe epilepsy also showed a negative correlation between microglial phagocytic activity and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic generalized seizure history. These results indicate that microglial TREM2 and phagocytic activity may be important to epileptogenesis and the progression of focal temporal lobe epilepsy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryPhagocytic activity of microglia may impact generalized seizure development within both mice and humans.",

    "abstract": "Isomalto/malto-polysaccharides (IMMPs) are a novel type of soluble dietary fibres with a prebiotic potential promoting growth of beneficial microbes in the gut. However, the mode of action of IMMPs remains unknown. Previous studies on IMMPs showed an increase in total bacteria, especially lactobacilli, and higher production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) when IMMPs were fed to rats or used during in vitro fermentation. Here we investigated with metatranscriptomics how IMMPs with different amounts of -(1[-&gt;]6) glycosidic linkages affected microbial function during incubation with human faecal inoculum. We showed that active microbial community dynamics during fermentation varied depending on the type of IMMP used and that the observed changes were reflected in the community gene expression profiles. Based on metatranscriptome analysis, members of Bacteroides, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium were the predominant degraders of IMMPs, and the increased gene expression in these bacteria correlated with high amounts of -(1[-&gt;]6) glycosidic linkages. We also noted an increase in relative abundance of these bacteria and an activation of pathways involved in SCFA synthesis. Our findings could provide a baseline for more targeted approaches in designing prebiotics for specific bacteria and to achieve more controlled modulation of microbial activity towards desired health outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope protein (Env) mediates viral entry into host cells and is the primary target for the humoral immune response. Env is extensively glycosylated, and these glycans shield underlying epitopes from neutralizing antibodies. The glycosylation of Env is influenced by the type of host cell in which the virus is produced. Thus, HIV is distinctly glycosylated by CD4+ T cells, the major target cells, and macrophages. However, the specific differences in glycosylation between viruses produced in these cell types have not been explored at the molecular level. Moreover, the impact of these differences on viral spread and neutralization sensitivity remains largely unknown. To address these questions, we employed the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) model. Glycan analysis revealed higher relative levels of oligomannose-type N-glycans in SIV from CD4+ T cells (T-SIV) compared to SIV from macrophages (M-SIV), and the complex-type N-glycans profiles differed between the two viruses. Notably, M-SIV demonstrated greater infectivity than T-SIV, even when accounting for Env incorporation, suggesting that host cell-dependent factors influence infectivity. Further, M-SIV was more efficiently disseminated by HIV binding cellular lectins. We also evaluated the influence of cell type-dependent differences on SIVs vulnerability to carbohydrate binding agents (CBAs) and neutralizing antibodies. T-SIV demonstrated greater susceptibility to mannose-specific CBAs, possibly due to its elevated expression of oligomannose-type N-glycans. In contrast, M-SIV exhibited higher susceptibility to neutralizing sera in comparison to T-SIV. These findings underscore the importance of host cell-dependent attributes of SIV, such as glycosylation, in shaping both infectivity and the potential effectiveness of intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater snails are pivotal in transmitting schistosomiasis, a tropical parasitic disease affecting over 150 million people. The adaptive potential of these snails is a critical factor in determining how climate change and other environmental factors influence disease transmission dynamics, yet it has remained unexplored. Bulinus truncatus is the schistosome intermediate host snail with the widest geographic distribution and therefore plays a pivotal role in determining the maximum range of urogenital schistosomiasis. In this study, we assessed the local adaptation capacity of B. truncatus to temperature through an integrative approach encompassing phenotypic, ecophysiological, and genomic data. Ten snail populations from diverse thermal environments were collected in three countries, with eight populations reared in a common garden. The F2 generation (total N= 2592) was exposed to eight chronic temperature treatments and various life-history traits were recorded for over 14 weeks. Subsequently, ecophysiological analyses were conducted on the ten last surviving snails per population. Genotyping the parental generation collected in the field using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach, revealed 12,875 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of which 4.91 % were potentially under selection. We observed a significant association between these outlier SNPs, temperature, and precipitation. Thermal adaptations in life-history traits were evident, with lower survival rates at high temperatures of warm- origin snails compensated for by higher reproduction rates. Cold-origin snails, on the other hand, exhibited higher growth rates adapted to a shorter growing season. Ecophysiological adaptations included elevated sugar and haemoglobin contents in cold-adapted snails. In contrast, warm-adapted snails displayed increased protein levels but also more oxidative damage. Furthermore, heightened phenoloxidase levels indicated a more robust immune response in snails from parasite-rich regions. The substantial local adaptation capacity of B. truncatus holds profound implications for its response to climate change, future schistosomiasis risk, and the effectiveness of schistosomiasis control measures.\n\nHighlightsO_LILocal adaptation influences species responses to climate change\nC_LIO_LIThe snail Bulinus truncatus showed a high thermal local adaptation (LA) potential\nC_LIO_LILA is apparent through variations in life history and ecophysiological traits\nC_LIO_LIWe identified a significant genetic basis underlying this LA\nC_LIO_LILA of the hosts could sustain schistosomiasis transmission under global warming\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "While there is considerable research on interactions between invasive and native species, as well as on the impact of invasive species on the resident community, less focus has been placed on exploring the relationship and interactions among invasive species themselves. Nevertheless, it is widely acknowledged that invasive species can have either positive or negative effects on one anothers success, in addition to neutral outcomes. In the present theoretical study, we compared the success of two invasive non-native species in two scenarios: when they invaded the resident food web separately and simultaneously. We investigated the correlations between their direct and indirect ecological relationships and the topological positions of them in the food web, with the varying outcomes of joint invasion. Using the allometric bioenergetic model (ABM) for dynamical simulations, we detected the success of invasion (presence or absence of invaders) and the direction of their biomass change comparing separated and simultaneous invasion scenarios. We studied the relationships among these variables after detailed numerical simulations with variable key parameters of the model.\n\nWe found that direct and indirect ecological relationships between the two invaders are significantly modifies the invasion scenarios: the predator-prey relationship increases the probability of invasion success for both invaders, but the equilibrium biomass of at least one of them is more likely to be reduced than in separate invasions. The trophic cascade or competitive relationship between them during simultaneous invasion also affects their success rate, with the former having a positive effect and the latter a negative one. Further, we found that higher trophic level and lower betweenness centralities of the invaders reduces the likelihood of invasion success regardless of the presence or absence of another invasive species. The results of the study can be tested experimentally in micro- and mesocosms.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIIn a joint invasion, invaders can influence each others success\nC_LIO_LIPredator-prey relationships between invaders increase the joint invasion success\nC_LIO_LICompetition increases the failure of at least one invader\nC_LIO_LIThe trophic cascade between invaders increases the joint invasion success\nC_LIO_LIHigher trophic levels or lower betweenness centralities of the invaders increase the probability of unsuccessful joint invasion\nC_LI\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=140 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573872v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (63K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b3638eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4d1f47org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1409573org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@113dfd2_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTwo of the most potent drivers of genome evolution in eukaryotes are whole genome duplications (WGD) and transposable element (TE) activity. These two mutational forces can also play synergistic roles; WGDs result in both cellular stress and functional redundancy, which would allow TEs to escape host-silencing mechanisms and effectively spread with reduced impact on fitness. As TEs can function as, or evolve into, TE-derived cis-regulatory elements (TE-CREs), bursts of TE-activity following WGD are likely to impact evolution of gene regulation. However, the role of TEs in genome regulatory remodelling after WGDs is unclear. Here we used the genome of Atlantic salmon, which is known to have experienced massive expansion of TEs after a WGD [~]100 Mya, as a model system to explore the synergistic roles of TEs and WGDs on genome regulatory evolution.\n\nResultsWe identified 61,309 putative TE-CREs in Atlantic salmon using chromatin accessibility data from brain and liver. Of these, 82% were tissue specific to liver (43%) or brain (39%) and TE-CREs originating from retroelements were twice as common as those originating from DNA elements. Signatures of selection shaping TE-CRE evolution were evident from depletion of TEs in open chromatin, a bias in tissue-shared TE-CREs towards older TE-insertions, as well as tissue-specific processes shaping the TE-CRE repertoire. The DTT elements (Tc1-Mariners), which exploded in numbers at the time of the WGD, were significantly less prone to evolve into TE-CREs and significantly less potent in driving or repressing transcription compared to other TE-derived sequences. A minority of TEs (16% of consensus TEs) accounted for the origin of 46% of all TE-CREs, but these  CRE-superspreaders were not temporally associated with the WGD. Rather, the majority of TE-CREs, including those found to be significantly associated with gene regulatory evolution and thus found to drive or repress transcription, evolved from TE activity occurring across tens of millions of years following the WGD event.\n\nConclusionOur results do not support a WGD-associated TE-CRE rewiring of gene regulation. Instead we find that TEs from diverse superfamilies have been particularly effective in spreading TE-CREs and shaping gene regulatory networks under tissue-specific selection pressures, across millions of years following the salmonid WGD.",

    "abstract": "PurposeClonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) allows estimation of clonal dynamics and documentation of somatic mutations in the hematopoietic system. Recent studies utilizing large cohorts of the general population and patients have revealed significant associations of CHIP burden with age and disease status, including in cancer and chronic diseases. An increasing number of cancer patients are treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), but the association of ICI response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with CHIP burden remains to be determined.\n\nExperimental DesignWe collected blood samples from 100 metastatic NSCLC patients before and after ICI for high-depth sequencing of the CHIP panel and 63 samples for blood single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in an independent replication cohort of 180 patients.\n\nResultsThe impact of CHIP status on the immunotherapy response was not significant. However, metastatic lung cancer patients showed higher CHIP prevalence (44/100 for patients vs 5/42 for controls; P = 0.01). In addition, lung squamous cell carcinoma patients showed increased burden of larger clones compared to lung adenocarcinoma patients (8/43 for LUSC vs 2/50 for LUAD; P = 0.04). Furthermore, single cell RNA-seq analysis of the matched patients showed significant enrichment of inflammatory pathways mediated by NF-B in myeloid clusters of the severe CHIP group.\n\nConclusionsOur findings suggest minimal involvement of CHIP mutation and clonal dynamics during immunotherapy but a possible role of CHIP as an indicator of immunologic response in NSCLC patients.\n\nStatement of translational relevanceThis study, employing CHIP-targeted sequencing and blood scRNA-seq, delivers four main messages with clinical implication; (1) No significant effect of CHIP status on the treatment response to ICI, (2) Minimal involvement of ICI treatment in the CHIP clonal dynamics of NSCLC patients, (3) Bias of high-burden clonal hematopoiesis towards lung squamous carcinoma over adenocarcinoma, and (4) An the altered inflammatory signature in myeloid cells of NSCLC patients with high CHIP burden. Specifically, our scRNA-seq analysis revealed enhanced inflammatory signatures involving the NF-kB and AP-1 pathways in the myeloid cells of patients with a high-CHIP burden. These findings lead to more precise understanding of CHIP involvement during ICI treatment in NSCLC patients.",

Enteropan-pre-exposed P. aeruginosa displayed reduced ([~]70%{downarrow}) virulence towards the model host Caenorhabditis elegans. Enteropan affected various traits like biofilm formation, protein synthesis and secretion, quorum-modulated pigment production, antibiotic susceptibility, nitrogen metabolism etc. in this pathogen. P. aeruginosa could not develop complete resistance to the virulence-attenuating activity of Enteropan even after repeated exposure to this polyherbal formulation. Whole transcriptome analysis showed 17% of P. aeruginosa genome to get differentially expressed under influence of Enteropan. Major mechanisms through which Enteropan exerted its anti-virulence activity were found to be generation of nitrosative stress, oxidative stress, envelop stress, quorum modulation, disturbance of protein homeostasis and metal homeostasis. Network analysis of the differently expressed genes resulted in identification of 10 proteins with high network centrality as potential targets from among the down-regulated genes. Differential expression of genes coding for five (rpoA, tig, rpsB, rpsL, and rpsJ) of these targets was validated through RT-PCR too, and they can further be pursued as potential targets by various drug discovery programmes.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer brain metastases (LC-BrMs) are frequently associated with dismal mortality rates in patients with lung cancer; however, standard of care therapies for LC-BrMs are still limited in their efficacy. A deep understanding of molecular mechanisms and tumor microenvironment of LC-BrMs will provide us with new insights into developing novel therapeutics for treating patients with LC-BrMs. Here, we performed integrated analyses of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data which were derived from a total number of 174 patients with paired and unpaired primary lung cancer and LC-BrM, spanning four published and two newly generated patient cohorts on both bulk and single cell levels. We uncovered that LC-BrMs exhibited significantly higher intra-tumor heterogeneity. We also observed that mutations in a subset of genes were almost always shared by both primary lung cancers and LC-BrM lesions, including TTN, TP53, MUC16, LRP1B, RYR2, and EGFR. In addition, the genome-wide landscape of somatic copy number alterations was similar between primary lung cancers and LC-BrM lesions. Nevertheless, several regions of focal amplification were significantly enriched in LC-BrMs, including 5p15.33 and 20q13.33. Intriguingly, integrated analyses of transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data revealed mitochondrial-specific metabolism was activated but tumor immune microenvironment was suppressed in LC-BrMs. Subsequently, we validated our results by conducting real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR experiments, immunohistochemistry and multiplexed immunofluorescence staining of patients paired tumor specimens. Patients with a higher expression of mitochondrial metabolism genes but a lower expression of immune genes in their LC-BrM lesions tended to have a worse survival outcome. Therapeutically, targeting oxidative phosphorylation with gamitrinib in patient-derived organoids specific to LC-BrMs induced apoptosis and inhibited cell proliferation. The combination of gamitrinib plus anti-PD-1 immunotherapy significantly improved survival of mice bearing LC-BrMs. In conclusion, our findings not only provide comprehensive and integrated perspectives of molecular underpinnings of LC-BrMs but also contribute to the development of a potential, rationale-based combinatorial therapeutic strategy with the goal of translating it into clinical trials for patients with LC-BrMs.",

    "abstract": "Viruses compete with each other for limited cellular resources, and some viruses deliver defense mechanisms that protect the host from competing genetic parasites. PARIS is a defense system, often encoded in viral genomes, that is composed of a 53 kDa ABC ATPase (AriA) and a 35 kDa TOPRIM nuclease (AriB). Here we show that AriA and AriB assemble into a 425 kDa supramolecular immune complex. We use cryo-EM to determine the structure of this complex which explains how six molecules of AriA assemble into a propeller-shaped scaffold that coordinates three subunits of AriB. ATP-dependent detection of foreign proteins triggers the release of AriB, which assembles into a homodimeric nuclease that blocks infection by cleaving the host tRNALys. Phage T5 subverts PARIS immunity through expression of a tRNALys variant that prevents PARIS-mediated cleavage, and thereby restores viral infection. Collectively, these data explain how AriA functions as an ATP-dependent sensor that detects viral proteins and activates the AriB toxin. PARIS is one of an emerging set of immune systems that form macromolecular complexes for the recognition of foreign proteins, rather than foreign nucleic acids.",

Here, we developed a collection of compact ONE vector G-protein Optical (ONE-GO) biosensor constructs as a scalable platform that can be conveniently deployed to measure G-protein activation by virtually any GPCR with high fidelity even when expressed endogenously in primary cells. By characterizing dozens of GPCRs across many cell types like primary cardiovascular cells or neurons, we revealed new insights into the molecular basis for G-protein coupling selectivity of GPCRs, pharmacogenomic profiles of anti-psychotics on naturally-occurring GPCR variants, and G-protein subtype signaling bias by endogenous GPCRs depending on cell type or upon inducing disease-like states. In summary, this open-source platform makes the direct interrogation of context-dependent GPCR activity broadly accessible.",

    "abstract": "Most of the fundamental processes of cells are mediated by proteins. However, the biologically- relevant mechanism of most proteins are poorly understood. Dominant negative mutations have provided a valuable tool for investigating mechanism, but can be difficult to isolate because of their toxic effects. We used a mutational scanning approach to identify dominant negative mutations in yeast Hsp90. Hsp90 is a chaperone that forms dynamic complexes with many co- chaperones and client proteins. In vitro analyses have elucidated some key biochemical states and structures of Hsp90, co-chaperones, and clients; however, the biological mechanism of Hsp90 remains unclear. For example, high throughput studies have found that many E3 ubiquitin ligases bind to Hsp90, but it is unclear if these are primarily clients or acting to tag other clients for degradation. Our analysis of all point mutations in Hsp90 identified 205 that dramatically slowed the growth of yeast harboring a second WT copy of Hsp90. 75% of the dominant negative mutations that we identified were located in a loop that closes over bound ATP. We analyzed a small panel of individual dominant mutations in this loop in detail. In this panel, addition of the E33A mutation that prevents ATP hydrolysis by Hsp90 abrogated the dominant negative phenotype. Pull-down experiments did not reveal any stable binding partners, indicating that the dominant effects were mediated by dynamic complexes. We examined the stability to proteolysis of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a model Hsp90 substrate. Upon expression of dominant negative Hsp90 variants, GR was rapidly destabilized in a proteasome-dependent fashion. These findings provide evidence that the binding of E3 ligases to Hsp90 may serve a quality control function fundamental to eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria and the viruses that infect them (bacteriophages or phages) are engaged in an evolutionary arms race that has resulted in the development of hundreds of bacterial defense systems and myriad phage-encoded counterdefenses1-5. While the mechanisms of many bacterial defense systems are known1, how these systems avoid toxicity outside infection yet activate quickly upon sensing phage infection is less well understood. Here, we show that the bacterial Phage Anti-Restriction-Induced System (PARIS) operates as a toxin-antitoxin system, in which the antitoxin AriA sequesters and inactivates the toxin AriB until triggered by the T7 phage counterdefense protein Ocr. Using cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM), we show that AriA is structurally similar to dimeric SMC-family ATPases but assembles into a distinctive homohexameric complex through two distinct oligomerization interfaces. In the absence of infection, the AriA hexamer binds up to three monomers of AriB, maintaining them in an inactive state. Ocr binding to the AriA-AriB complex triggers rearrangement of the AriA hexamer, releasing AriB and allowing it to dimerize and activate. AriB is a toprim/OLD-family nuclease whose activation arrests cell growth and inhibits phage propagation by globally inhibiting protein translation. Collectively, our findings reveal the intricate molecular mechanisms of a bacterial defense system that evolved in response to a phage counterdefense protein, and highlight how an SMC-family ATPase has been adapted as a bacterial infection sensor.",

Cholesterol is an essential lipid that has been highlighted to play a role in regulating the activity of membrane transporters such as LAT1, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving this phenomenon. Here we perform a comprehensive computational analysis to investigate cholesterols role in LAT1 structure and function, focusing on four cholesterol binding sites (CHOL1-4) identified in a recent LAT1-apo inward-open conformation cryo-EM structure. We performed four independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of LAT1 bound to each cholesterol molecule, as well as molecular docking, free energy calculation by MM/GBSA, and other analysis tools, to investigate LAT1-cholesterol interactions. Our results indicate that CHOL3 provides the most stable binding interactions with LAT1, and CHOL3 and CHOL1 sites have the largest stabilizing effect on LAT1s primary functional motifs (hash and bundle) and substrate binding site. Our analysis also uncovers an alternative cholesterol binding site to the originally assigned CHOL1. Our study improves the understanding of cholesterols modulatory effect on LAT1 and proposes candidate sites for discovery of future allosteric ligands with rational design.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) is the most common condition with intellectual disability and is caused by trisomy of Homo sapiens chromosome 21 (HSA21). The increased dosage of genes on HSA21 is the cause for the initial neurodevelopmental disorder and for further development of cognitive decline, however the molecular mechanisms promoting brain pathology along ageing are still missing. One of the major challenges in the study of DS is the lack of reliable murine model able to accurately replicate genotypic and phenotypic aspects observed in humans along ageing. Preclinical studies in DS were pioneered using the Ts65Dn murine model, which despite its genetic limitations, has been extremely helpful in characterising the progression of brain degeneration. The novel Ts66Yah model represents an evolution of the Ts65Dn, with phenotypes only induced by trisomic HSA21 homologous genes, closer to human DS condition. In this study, we confirmed the behavioural features of Ts66Yah mice with improvement in the detection of spatial memory defects and also a new anxiety-related phenotype. The molecular characterisation of Ts66Yah demonstrated the aberrant regulation of redox balance, proteostasis, stress response, metabolic pathways, programmed cell death and synaptic plasticity. Intriguingly, the genotype-related alterations of those pathways occur early promoting the alteration of brain development and the onset of a condition of premature aging. Overall, data collected in Ts66Yah provide novel and consolidated insights, devoid of genome bias, concerning trisomy-driven processes that contribute to brain pathology in conjunction with aging. This, in turn, aids in bridging the existing gap in comprehending the intricate nature of DS phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The ability to proficiently play a musical instrument requires a fine-grained synchronisation between several sensorimotor and cognitive brain regions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the brain undergoes functional changes with intensive musical training, which has also been identified in resting-state data. These studies have investigated changes in brain networks using fMRI or analysing electrophysiological frequency-specific networks in isolation (i.e., neural oscillatory networks). While the analysis of such \"mono-layer\" networks has proven useful, it fails to capture the complexities of multiple interacting networks. To this end, we applied a multilayer network framework for analysing publicly available data (Open MEG Archive) obtained with magnetoencephalography (MEG). We investigated resting-state differences between participants with musical training (n=31) and those without (n=31). While single-layer Network-Based Statistics analysis did not demonstrate any group differences, our multilayer analysis revealed that musicians show a modular organisation that spans visuomotor and frontotemporal areas, which are known to be involved in the execution of a musical performance. This twofold modular structure was found to be significantly different from non-musicians. The differences between the two groups are primarily seen in the theta (6.5-8Hz), alpha1 (8.5-10Hz) and beta1 (12.5-16Hz) frequency bands. No statistically significant relationships were found between self-reported measures of musical training and network properties, which could be attributed to the heterogeneity of the dataset. However, we demonstrate that the novel analysis method provides additional information that single-layer analysis methods cannot. Overall, the multilayer network method provides a unique opportunity to explore the pan-spectral nature of oscillatory networks, with studies of brain plasticity in musicians as a potential future application of the novel method.",

Three groups of healthy controls were recruited to measure responses to intensity deviants when different frequencies were used for the alternating blocks. For one group, the whole experiment was set at a single frequency; for the next, blocks were played at 6 kHz and at a frequency 1/3 octave below 6 kHz (small difference); the last group was presented with blocks that had tones at 6 kHz and 1 kHz frequencies (large difference).

Whereas extensive work in rodents has produced much of our knowledge of OT, we lack basic information about its neurobiology in primates making it difficult to interpret the limited effects that OT manipulations have had in human patients. In fact, previous studies have revealed only limited OT fibers in primate brains. Here, we investigated the OT connectome in marmoset using immunohistochemistry, and mapped OT fibers throughout the brains of adult male and female marmoset monkeys. We found extensive OT projections reaching limbic and cortical areas that are involved in the regulation of social behaviors, such as the amygdala, the medial prefrontal cortex and the basal ganglia. The pattern of OT fibers observed in marmosets is notably similar to the OT connectomes described in rodents. Our findings here contrast with previous results by demonstrating a broad distribution of OT throughout the marmoset brain. Given the prevalence of this neurohormone in the primate brain, methods developed in rodents to manipulate endogenous OT are likely to be applicable in marmosets.",

Herein, we mapped the primary chromatin-bound ERR interactome in mouse liver.\n\nMethodsRIME (Rapid Immuno-precipitation Mass spectrometry of Endogenous proteins) analysis using mouse liver samples from two circadian time points was used to catalog ERR-interacting proteins on chromatin. The genomic crosstalk between ERR and its identified cofactors in the transcriptional control of precise gene programs was explored through cross-examination of genome-wide binding profiles from chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) studies. The dynamic interplay between ERR and its newly uncovered cofactor Host cell factor C1 (HCFC1) was further investigated by loss-of-function studies in hepatocytes.\n\nResultsCharacterization of the hepatic ERR chromatin interactome led to the identification of 48 transcriptional interactors of which 42 were previously unknown including HCFC1. Interrogation of available ChIP-seq binding profiles highlighted oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) under the control of a complex regulatory network between ERR and multiple cofactors. While ERR and HCFC1 were found to bind to a large set of common genes, only a small fraction showed their co-localization, found predominately near the transcriptional start sites of genes particularly enriched for components of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Knockdown studies demonstrated inverse regulatory actions of ERR and HCFC1 on OXPHOS gene expression ultimately dictating the impact of their loss-of-function on mitochondrial respiration.\n\nConclusionsOur work unveils a repertoire of previously unknown transcriptional partners of ERR comprised of chromatin modifiers and transcription factors thus advancing our knowledge of how ERR regulates metabolic transcriptional programs.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (ECs) experience a variety of highly dynamic mechanical stresses. Among others, cyclic stretch and increased plasma membrane tension inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in non-ECs cells. How ECs overcome such unfavorable, from biophysical perspective, conditions and maintain CME remains elusive. Previously, we have used simultaneous two-wavelength axial ratiometry (STAR) microscopy to show that endocytic dynamics are similar between statically cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblast-like Cos-7 cells. Here we asked whether biophysical stresses generated by blood flow could favor one mechanism of clathrin-coated vesicle formation to overcome environment present in vasculature. We used our data processing platform - DrSTAR - to examine if clathrin dynamics are altered in HUVECs grown under fluidic sheer stress (FSS). Surprisingly, we found that FSS led to an increase in clathrin dynamics. In HUVECs grown under FSS we observed a 2.3-fold increase in clathrin-coated vesicle formation and a 1.9-fold increase in non-productive flat clathrin lattices compared to cells grown in static conditions. The curvature-positive events had significantly delayed curvature initiation in flow-stimulated cells, highlighting a shift toward flat-to-curved clathrin transitions in vesicle formation. Overall, our findings indicate that clathrin dynamics and CCV formation can be modulated by the local physiological environment and represents an important regulatory mechanism.\n\nSignificanceTargeted nanomedicine holds a great promise of improved drug bioavailability and specificity. While some cargoes must cross the blood-tissue barrier, the understanding of endocytic pathways in the context of vasculature is limited, which is an obstacle to targeted nanomedicine delivery. In this pilot study we show that the physiological local vascular environment must be considered in the context of internalization of growth factors, membrane proteins, therapeutics, or pathogens. Studies in non-ECs or ECs not cultured under fluidic shear stress do not properly recapitulate clathrin dynamics and will lead to incorrect conclusions.",

    "abstract": "The group vigilance hypothesis suggests animals within a group have a lower overall vigilance level than solitary individuals due to the collective responsibility of predator detection. Previous methods of studying vigilance have used head position as a proxy to indicate a state of vigilance, but it has been suggested that this method is too ambiguous, and the observer cannot accurately ascertain the exact behavioural state of the focal animal. Here, we consider blinking as a proxy for vigilance, as the eye-closure during a blink momentarily reduces the animals information about the environment, increasing the risk of unanticipated predator attack. We videoed semi-captive herds of red deer Cervus elaphus and fallow deer Dama dama, and quantified their blinking behaviour using behavioural logging software. We show that blink rate decreased with increasing group size in both species, suggesting that blinking may be tied with social vigilance rather than anti-predator vigilance. Similarly, the length of the inter-blink interval increased with increasing group size in red deer. Male red deer blinked less than females, and had longer inter-blink intervals, which suggests that blinking may be related to sex-specific behaviour. We discuss the suitability of blinking measures for assessing vigilance behaviour.",

    "abstract": "The advent of single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has driven significant computational methods development for all steps in the scRNA-seq data analysis pipeline, including filtering, normalization, and clustering. The large number of methods and their resulting parameter combinations has created a combinatorial set of possible pipelines to analyze scRNA-seq data, which leads to the obvious question: which is best? Several benchmarking studies have sought to compare methods to answer this, but frequently find variable performance depending on dataset and pipeline characteristics. Alternatively, the large number of publicly available scRNA-seq datasets along with advances in supervised machine learning raise a tantalizing possibility: could the optimal pipeline be predicted for a given dataset? Here we begin to answer this question by applying 288 scRNA-seq analysis pipelines to 86 datasets and quantifying pipeline success via a range of measures evaluating cluster purity and biological plausibility. We build supervised machine learning models to predict pipeline success given a range of dataset and pipeline characteristics. We find both that prediction performance is significantly better than random and that in many cases pipelines predicted to perform well provide clustering outputs similar to expert-annotated cell type labels. Finally, we identify characteristics of scRNA-seq datasets that correlate with strong prediction performance that could guide when such prediction models may be useful.",

    "abstract": "Accurately building three-dimensional (3D) atomic structures from 3D cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) density maps is a crucial step in the cryo-EM-based determination of the structures of protein complexes. Despite improvements in the resolution of 3D cryo-EM density maps, the de novo conversion of density maps into 3D atomic structures for protein complexes that do not have accurate homologous or predicted structures to be used as templates remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce Cryo2Struct, a fully automated ab initio cryo-EM structure modeling method that utilizes a 3D transformer to identify atoms and amino acid types in cryo-EM density maps first, and then employs a novel Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to connect predicted atoms to build backbone structures of proteins. Tested on a standard test dataset of 128 cryo-EM density maps with varying resolutions (2.1 - 5.6 [A]) and different numbers of residues (730 - 8,416), Cryo2Struct built substantially more accurate and complete protein structural models than the widely used ab initio method - Phenix in terms of multiple evaluation metrics. Moreover, on a new test dataset of 500 recently released density maps with varying resolutions (1.9 - 4.0 [A]) and different numbers of residues (234 - 8,828), it built more accurate models than on the standard dataset. And its performance is rather robust against the change of the resolution of density maps and the size of protein structures.",

    "abstract": "Stimulator of interferon genes (STING) is an immune adaptor protein that senses cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) in response to self or microbial cytosolic DNA as a danger signal. STING is ubiquitously expressed in diverse cell populations including cancer cells with distinct cellular functions such as activation of type I interferons, autophagy induction, or triggering apoptosis. It is not well understood whether and which subsets of immune cells, stromal cells, or cancer cells are particularly important for STING-mediated antitumor immunity. Here using a polymeric STING-activating nanoparticle (PolySTING) with a \"shock-and-lock\" dual activation mechanism, we show type 1 conventional dendritic cell (cDC1) is essential for STING-mediated rejection of multiple established and metastatic murine tumors. STING status in the host but not in the cancer cells (Tmem173-/-) is important for antitumor efficacy. Specific depletion of cDC1 (Batf3-/-) or STING deficiency in cDC1 (XCR1creSTINGfl/fl) abolished PolySTING efficacy, whereas depletion of other myeloid cells had little effect. Adoptive transfer of wildtype cDC1 in Batf3-/- mice restored antitumor efficacy while transfer of cDC1 with STING or IRF3 deficiency failed to rescue. PolySTING induced a specific chemokine signature in wildtype but not Batf3-/- mice. Multiplexed immunohistochemistry analysis of STING-activating cDC1s in resected tumors correlates with patient survival while also showing increased expressions after neoadjuvant pembrolizumab therapy in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Therefore, we have defined that a subset of myeloid cells is essential for STING-mediated antitumor immunity with associated biomarkers for prognosis.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA \"shock-and-lock\" nanoparticle agonist induces direct STING signaling in type 1 conventional dendritic cells to drive antitumor immunity with defined biomarkers",

    "abstract": "As animal populations continue to decline, understanding global patterns of life histories will improve our predictions of species vulnerability and extinction risk to prioritise management. Sharks and rays are threatened with extinction due to overfishing, particularly in the tropics and sub-tropics. Metabolic theory suggests that warm-water species and populations will have a higher maximum intrinsic rate of population increase (rmax) and therefore will be less intrinsically sensitive to exploitation. However, recent empirical work has highlighted a paradox and shown that warm, shallow-water tropical rays have lower rmax than cold, deep-water temperate skates. We test whether the different reproductive strategies of live-bearing rays and egg-laying skates explain this observed paradox by comparing variation in rmax with adult body mass, offspring size, temperature, and depth across 85 species of rays and skates. Our results show that the large relative offspring size of warm, shallow-water tropical rays better explains their greater intrinsic sensitivity (lower rmax) compared to cold, deep-water temperate skates. This is consistent with life history theory that suggests rmax is greater in species with smaller relative offspring size. We hypothesise that the larger relative offspring size may be driven by greater predation risk in the tropics and may help explain global patterns of intrinsic sensitivity to overexploitation.",

    "abstract": "Cancer stem cells (CSCs) drive cancer metastatic dissemination. They do not do so in a vacuum, and the important influence of the tumour microenvironment (TME) on metastatic dissemination is becoming increasingly recognised. Therapeutic targeting of CSC-TME interactions may be a promising route to suppression of tumour metastasis. However, we must first understand how interactions with the TME influence CSC metastatic dissemination. To achieve this understanding, there is a need for experimental models that enable the analysis of dynamic interactions at single cell resolution within a complex environment. To this end, we utilise a metastasis-on-a-chip device to produce a 3D in vitro model of CSC interaction with a developing microvasculature, that is amenable to precise imaging and real time studies at single cell resolution. We show that the invasive phenotype of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells is markedly altered when in proximity to a microvasculature, with a switch to a hybrid CSC phenotype that undergoes collective streaming invasion. Mechanistically, ECM compression by the developing vasculature creates an environment that is refractory to cancer invasion, whilst leaving abandoned vascular tracks that can be utilised by hybrid CSCs for collective streaming invasion. Human tissue studies identify streaming invasion in association with vascularised regions in OSCC specimens. These findings elucidate the influence of the vasculature on CSC metastatic dissemination in OSCC, and the role of hybrid CSC invasion plasticity in overcoming this TME constraint.",

These two processes are interconnected and governed by Plexin-B2 that orchestrates cortical actin and membrane tension, shown by biomechanical assays. Molecular dynamics simulations predict that balanced membrane and actin tension are required for optimal migratory velocity and consistency. Furthermore, Plexin-B2 mechanosensitive function requires a bendable extracellular ring structure and affects membrane internalization, permeability, phospholipid composition, as well as inner membrane surface charge.

Most patients present with regional and distant metastasis, associated with poor prognosis. Lipids may play an essential role in either activating or inhibiting detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis), where the latter is a crucial mechanism to prevent metastasis, and it may have a cross-talk with autophagy. Autophagy has been shown to be induced in various human cancer metastasis, modulating tumor cell motility and invasion, cancer cell differentiation, resistance to anoikis, and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Hence, it may play a crucial role in the transition of benign to malignant phenotypes, the core of metastasis initiation.

The remodelling of oxidative phosphorylation and enhanced lipogenesis are key characteristics of prostate cancer (PCa). Recently, succinate-dependent mitochondrial reprogramming was identified in high-grade prostate tumours with upregulation of enzymes associated with branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) catabolism. We hypothesised that the degradation of BCAAs, particularly valine may play a critical role in anapleurotic refuelling of the mitochondrial succinate pool. Through suppression of valine availability, we report strongly reduced lipid content despite compensatory upregulation of fatty acid uptake, indicating valine is an important lipogenic fuel in PCa. Inhibition of the enzyme 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-CoA hydrolase (HIBCH) also resulted in selective inhibition of cellular proliferation of malignant but not benign prostate cells and impaired succinate production. In combination with a comprehensive multi-omic investigation of patient and cell line data, our work highlights a therapeutic target for selective inhibition of metabolic reprogramming in PCa.",

Present work is focused on the visualization and quantification of cellular metabolic heterogeneity of colorectal cancer using fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of metabolic cofactor NAD(P)H. FLIM-microscopy of NAD(P)H was performed in vitro in four cancer cell lines, in vivo in the four types of tumors in mice and ex vivo in patients tumor samples. The dispersion and bimodality of the decay parameters were evaluated to quantify the intercellular metabolic heterogeneity. Our results demonstrate that patients tumors have significantly higher heterogeneity of metabolism compared with cultured cells and tumor xenografts. It was found that dispersion of a contribution of a free fraction of NAD(P)H is higher in the high-grade tumors, and the bimodality in a distribution of the free NAD(P)H fraction has associations with tumor metastasis. These results indicate that cell-level metabolic heterogeneity assessed from NAD(P)H FLIM has a potential to become a clinical prognostic factor.",

    "abstract": "Cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of mortality in patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Hypertension is seen in 70% of patients by the age of 30 prior to decline in kidney function. The natriuretic peptides (NPs), atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), are released by cardiomyocytes in response to membrane stretch, increasing urinary excretion of sodium and water. Mice heterozygous for Pkd2 have attenuated NP responses and we hypothesized that cardiomyocyte-localized polycystin proteins contribute to production of NPs. Cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out models of polycystin-2 (PC2), one of the causative genes of ADPKD, demonstrate diurnal hypertension. These mice have decreased ANP and BNP expression in the left ventricle. Analysis of the pathways involved in production, maturation, and activity of NPs identified decreased transcription of CgB, PCSK6, and NFAT genes in cPC2-KOs. Engineered heart tissue with human iPSCs driven into cardiomyocytes with CRISPR/Cas9 KO of PKD2 failed to produce ANP. These results suggest that PC2 in cardiomyocytes are involved in NP production and lack of cardiac PC2 predisposes to a hypertensive volume expanded phenotype, which may contribute to the development of hypertension in ADPKD.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac arrhythmias are common disorders that can be fatal. Modern methods of treating bradyarrhythmias include the implantation of pacemakers and cardioverters - defibrillators. However, the implantable devices can cause various complications including infectious ones, related to the electrodes installed inside the heart. Less invasive heart rhythm modulation could be beneficial for some cohorts of patients. We present an alternative approach to heart pacing based on thermogenetics. We used adeno-associated viruses to deliver genetic human transient receptor potential subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1), a heat-sensitive cation channel, into isolated cardiomyocytes and the mouse heart. This allowed us to induce action potentials and control contractility using short heat pulses delivered by infrared laser illumination. Using this approach, we demonstrated the thermogenetic pacing of isolated cardiomyocytes in vitro and in the mouse heart in vivo. Our results demonstrate the unique potential of thermogenetics for developing novel therapeutic strategies for heart rhythm modulation.",

    "abstract": "The risk of developing Alzheimers disease (AD) significantly increases in individuals carrying the APOE{varepsilon}4 allele. Elderly cognitively healthy individuals with APOE{varepsilon}4 also exist, suggesting the presence of cellular mechanisms that counteract the pathological effects of APOE{varepsilon}4; however, these mechanisms are unknown. We hypothesized that APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers without dementia might carry genetic variations that could protect them from developing APOE{varepsilon}4-mediated AD pathology. To test this, we leveraged whole genome sequencing (WGS) data in National Institute on Aging Alzheimers Disease Family Based Study (NIA-AD FBS), Washington Heights/Inwood Columbia Aging Project (WHICAP), and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) cohorts and identified potentially protective variants segregating exclusively among unaffected APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers. In homozygous unaffected carriers above 70 years old, we identified 510 rare coding variants. Pathway analysis of the genes harboring these variants showed significant enrichment in extracellular matrix (ECM)-related processes, suggesting protective effects of functional modifications in ECM proteins. We prioritized two genes that were highly represented in the ECM-related gene ontology terms, (FN1) and collagen type VI alpha 2 chain (COL6A2) and are known to be expressed at the blood-brain barrier (BBB), for postmortem validation and in vivo functional studies. The FN1 and COL6A2 protein levels were increased at the BBB in APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers with AD. Brain expression of cognitively unaffected homozygous APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers had significantly lower FN1 deposition and less reactive gliosis compared to homozygous APOE{varepsilon}4 carriers with AD, suggesting that FN1 might be a downstream driver of APOE{varepsilon}4-mediated AD-related pathology and cognitive decline. To validate our findings, we used zebrafish models with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in fn1b - the ortholog for human FN1. We found that fibronectin LOF reduced gliosis, enhanced gliovascular remodeling and potentiated the microglial response, suggesting that pathological accumulation of FN1 could impair toxic protein clearance, which is ameliorated with FN1 LOF. Our study suggests vascular deposition of FN1 is related to the pathogenicity of APOE{varepsilon}4, LOF variants in FN1 may reduce APOE{varepsilon}4-related AD risk, providing novel clues to potential therapeutic interventions targeting the ECM to mitigate AD risk.",

    "abstract": "Research and medical genomics require comprehensive and scalable solutions to drive the discovery of novel disease targets, evolutionary drivers, and genetic markers with clinical significance. This necessitates a framework to identify all types of variants independent of their size (e.g., SNV/SV) or location (e.g., repeats). Here we present DRAGEN that utilizes novel methods based on multigenomes, hardware acceleration, and machine learning based variant detection to provide novel insights into individual genomes with [~]30min computation time (from raw reads to variant detection). DRAGEN outperforms all other state-of-the-art methods in speed and accuracy across all variant types (SNV, indel, STR, SV, CNV) and further incorporates specialized methods to obtain key insights in medically relevant genes (e.g., HLA, SMN, GBA). We showcase DRAGEN across 3,202 genomes and demonstrate its scalability, accuracy, and innovations to further advance the integration of comprehensive genomics for research and medical applications.",

    "abstract": "Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome with cancer predisposition. Most FA patients develop aplastic anemia during childhood and have an extremely high cumulative risk to develop cancer during their lifespan. Myeloid malignancy is one of the main tumor risks for patients with FA, including high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Although bone marrow transplantation is the treatment of choice for FA patients that develop aplastic anemia, patients with a more stable bone marrow remain at a high risk of presenting MDS/AML and should be monitored for appearance of myeloid malignant clones. Markers for an as-early-as-possible identification of emerging myeloid malignant cells are needed for the monitoring of patients with FA, since quick medical action after detection of neoplastic transformation is needed.\n\nIn this work we have leveraged publicly available single cell RNA seq (scRNAseq) datasets of patients with MDS and AML for training deep neural networks (DNN). We have generated two machine learning models aimed to identify myeloid malignant transcriptional profiles in scRNAseq datasets from the bone marrow of patients with FA, one for detection of MDS and a second one for AML. Both predictors displayed high sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for detection of single cell resolution myeloid malignant transcriptional profiles.\n\nMultiple tools for analysis of single cell transcriptional data were implemented to characterize the predicted MDS and AML cells. Our analysis suggests that the predicted MDS and AML cells from FA patients are enriched in the lympho-myeloid-primed progenitor (LMPP) and the granulocyte-monocyte progenitor (GMP) populations. The predicted MDS and AML cells have gene expression and master transcriptional factor profiles that suggest malignant transformation and that differ from the rest of FA cells. Also cues of immune evasion were detected using single cell pathway analysis (SCPA) and cell-cell communication profiles. Next work will be aimed to find potential cell surface markers on the predicted MDS and AML cells as well as to assess our predictions in primary samples from FA patients.",

    "abstract": "We report the development of a 384-well formatted NanoBRET assay to characterize molecular glues of 14-3-3/client interactions in living cells. The seven isoforms of 14-3-3 are dimeric hub proteins with diverse roles including transcription factor regulation and signal transduction. 14-3-3 interacts with hundreds of client proteins to regulate their function and is therefore an ideal therapeutic target when client selectivity can be achieved. We have developed the NanoBRET system for three 14-3-3{sigma} client proteins CRAF, TAZ, and estrogen receptor  (ER), which represent three specific binding modes. We have measured stabilization of 14-3-3{sigma}/client complexes by molecular glues with EC50 values between 100 nM and 1 M in cells, which align with the EC50 values calculated by fluorescence anisotropy in vitro. Developing this NanoBRET system for the hub protein 14-3-3{sigma} allows for a streamlined approach, bypassing multiple optimization steps in the assay development process for other 14-3-3{sigma} clients. The NanoBRET system allows for an assessment of PPI stabilization in a more physiologically relevant, cell-based environment using full-length proteins. The method is applicable to diverse protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and offers a robust platform to explore libraries of compounds for both PPI stabilizers and inhibitors.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=55 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/573792v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (17K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f1531org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a862cdorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ee8f6dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a780e_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",
