    "abstract": "BackgroundLong-term heavy drinking is a major risk factor for cerebral microbleeds(CMBs), which are increasingly gaining attention as a pathological phenotype of cerebral small vessel diseases(CSVD). Under pathological conditions, remodeling of the extracellular matrix(ECM) on the walls of small vessels causes disarray in the structure and function of these vessels, leading to cerebral small vessel sclerosis and consequent rupture and bleeding. This can result in cognitive and emotional disorders, abnormal gait and increased risk of falling. However, the mechanisms underlying how long-term alcohol consumption leads to CMBs and decline in motor function remain unknown.\n\nMethodsWe constructed a chronic alcohol exposure mouse model and measured the deposition of ECMs on the small vessels in motor-related brain regions. The presence of microbleeds was confirmed through Prussian blue staining and Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We also extracted primary cerebral microvascular smooth muscle cells (CMVSMCs) from the newborn mice and explored the effects of alcohol on the phenotypic transformation and substance synthesis function. Additionally, we conducted interventional experiments on the cell and animal models with an anti-fibrotic drugs Pirfenidone(PFD).\n\nResultsWe found that mice with long-term alcohol exposure showed decreased motor function. In their motor-related brain regions, such as the motor cortex(MC), thalamus/basal ganglia(Tha/BG), and cerebellum(CB), we observed microbleeds. On the small vessels in these areas, we detected excessive deposited ECM proteins. In vitro experiments with primary CMVSMCs revealed that after alcohol treatment, the cells underwent a transformation into fibroblast-like phenotypes, and excessive production of the aforementioned ECM proteins, which is regulated by upstream TGF{beta}1/Smad signaling pathway. Additionally, PFD applied on cell and animal models could reverse the above processes to some extent.\n\nConclusionsOur study found that the remodeling of ECM accompanied by activation of TGF-{beta}1/Smad signaling pathway may be involved in alcohol-induced CMBs. It could be a potential therapeutic target for CMBs or CSVD.",

    "abstract": "Centriole number must be restricted to two in cycling cells to avoid pathological cell divisions. Multiciliated cells (MCC), however, need to produce a hundred or more centrioles to nucleate the same number of motile cilia required for fluid flow circulation. These centrioles are produced by highjacking cell cycle and centriole duplication programs. However, how the MCC progenitor handles such a massive number of centrioles to finally organize them in an apical basal body patch is unclear. Here, using new cellular models and high-resolution imaging techniques, we identify the microtubule network as the bandleader, and show how it orchestrates the process in space and in time. Organized by the pre-existing centrosome at the start of amplification, microtubules build a nest of centriolar components from which procentrioles emerge. When amplification is over, the centrosomes dominance is lost as new centrioles mature and become microtubule nucleators. Microtubules then drag all the centrioles to the nuclear membrane, assist their isotropic perinuclear disengagement and their subsequent collective apical migration. These results reveal that in brain MCC as in cycling cells, the same dynamics - from the centrosome to the cell pole via the nucleus-exists, is the result of a reflexive link between microtubules and the progressive maturation of new centrioles, and participates in the organized reshaping of the entire cytoplasm. On the other hand, new elements described in this work such as microtubule-driven organization of a nest, identification of a spatio-temporal progression of centriole growth and microtubule-assisted disengagement, may shed new light on the centriole duplication program.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/579615v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (21K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@112cdeforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18e35a5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1642409org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@179cc9c_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The FAM83 (Family with sequence similarity 83) family is highly conserved in vertebrates, but little is known of the functions of these proteins beyond their association with oncogenesis. Of the family, FAM83F is of particular interest because it is the only membrane-targeted FAM83 protein. When over-expressed, FAM83F activates the canonical Wnt signalling pathway and binds to and stabilizes p53; it therefore interacts with two pathways often dysregulated in disease. Insights into gene function can often be gained by studying the roles they play during development, and here we report the generation of fam83f knock-out (KO) zebrafish, which we have used to study the role of Fam83f in vivo. We show that endogenous fam83f is most strongly expressed in the hatching gland of developing zebrafish embryos, and that fam83f KO embryos hatch earlier than their wild-type (WT) counterparts, despite developing at a comparable rate. We also demonstrate that fam83f KO embryos are more sensitive to ionizing radiation than WT embryos--an unexpected finding, bearing in mind the previously-reported ability of FAM83F to stabilize p53. Transcriptomic analysis shows that loss of fam83f leads to downregulation of phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) binding proteins and impairment of cellular degradation pathways, particularly autophagy, a crucial component of the DNA damage response. Finally, we show that Fam83f protein is itself targeted to the lysosome when over-expressed in HEK293T cells, and that this localization is dependent upon a C terminal signal sequence. The zebrafish lines we have generated suggest that Fam83f plays an important role in autophagic/lysosomal processes, resulting in dysregulated hatching and increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Area-based conservation remains a pivotal component of global wildlife protection efforts. Mexico hosts a diverse array of area-based approaches, encompassing protected areas (PAs) and other effective area-based conservation measures (OECMs) such as voluntary conservation areas (VCAs) and wildlife management units (UMAs). Indigenous Territories (ITs) also provide heightened conservation potential through traditional ecological knowledge systems. These conservation spaces exhibit significant variations in community involvement, national coverage, and governance. Here, we evaluate the conservation potential of these land management types for 29 terrestrial carnivores, focusing on spatial co-occurrence. We determine areas in Mexico lacking area-based protection and calculate carnivore richness per land management type. Analyzing overlap between land management types and carnivore ranges, we employ heat maps to visualize overlap occurrence and key unprotected areas. We found that across all carnivore ranges, 87% of the area remains unprotected under designated protection areas (PAs & VCAs), decreasing to 65.2% after including non-designated types (ITs and UMAs). We identified several key gaps in the protection estate for Mexican carnivores, most notably on the eastern Mexican coast in the state of Veracruz. Our findings corroborate the importance of including Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in conservation efforts, emphasizing their contributions to the stewardship of Mexican ecosystems. As the global protected area estate continues to expand under the post-2020 global biodiversity targets, and the importance of a well-designed and diverse portfolio of practices for conservation is recognized, the need for collective action, increased collaboration and inclusivity, and effective communication amongst stakeholders becomes necessary for carnivore conservation.",

    "abstract": "A long-standing question in biology is how phenotypic variation is generated from genetic variation. In Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), an enigmatic genomic region containing the protein-coding gene cortex is repeatedly used to generate intraspecific wing color pattern polymorphisms in multiple species. While emerging evidence suggest that cortex itself is not the effector gene of this locus, the identity of the effector remains unknown. Here, we investigated two deeply conserved miRNAs embedded in the cortex locus, and discovered that one of them, mir-193, promotes melanic wing color. This miRNA is likely derived from an intron of a gigantic long non-coding RNA spanning the entire locus, and it elicits its function by directly repressing multiple pigmentation genes including a well-known melanin pathway gene, ebony. The function of mir-193 is conserved in a nymphalid and a pierid butterfly, belonging two families that diverged 90 Mya. We propose that mir-193 is the effector gene of this hotspot locus underlying a 100-million-year evolution of intraspecific wing color pattern polymorphisms in Lepidoptera. Our results suggest that small non-coding RNAs can drive adaptive evolution in animals.",

    "abstract": "When an organism encounters a pathogen, the host innate immune system activates to defend against pathogen colonization and toxic xenobiotics produced. C. elegans employ multiple defense systems to ensure survival when exposed to Pseudomonas aeruginosa including activation of the cytoprotective transcription factor SKN-1/NRF2. Although wildtype C. elegans quickly learn to avoid pathogens, here we describe a peculiar apathy-like behavior towards PA14 in animals with constitutive activation of SKN-1, whereby animals choose not to leave and continue to feed on the pathogen even when a non-pathogenic and healthspan-promoting food option is available. Although lacking the urgency to escape the infectious environment, animals with constitutive SKN-1 activity are not oblivious to the presence of the pathogen and display the typical pathogen-induced intestinal distension and eventual demise. SKN-1 activation, specifically in neurons and intestinal tissues, orchestrates a unique transcriptional program which leads to defects in serotonin signaling that is required from both neurons and non-neuronal tissues. Serotonin depletion from SKN-1 activation limits pathogen defense capacity, drives the pathogen-associated apathy behaviors and induces a synthetic sensitivity to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.

    "abstract": "Nuclear receptors are ligand-induced transcription factors that bind directly to target genes and regulate their expression. Ligand binding initiates conformational changes that propagate to other domains, allosterically regulating their activity. The nature of this interdomain communication in nuclear receptors is poorly understood, largely owing to the difficulty of experimentally characterizing full-length structures. We have applied computational modeling approaches to describe and study the structure of the full length farnesoid X receptor (FXR), approximated by the DNA binding domain (DBD) and ligand binding domain (LBD) connected by the flexible hinge region. Using extended molecular dynamics simulations (> 10 microseconds) and enhanced sampling simulations, we provide evidence that ligands selectively induce domain rearrangement, leading to interdomain contact. We use protein-protein interaction assays to provide experimental evidence of these interactions, identifying a critical role of the hinge in mediating interdomain contact. Our results illuminate previously unknown aspects of interdomain communication in FXR and provide a framework to enable characterization of other full length nuclear receptors.",

    "abstract": "The conversion of Adenosine (A) to Inosine (I), by Adenosine Deaminases Acting on RNA or ADARs, is an essential post-transcriptional modification that contributes to proteome diversity and regulation in metazoans including humans. In addition to its transcriptome-regulating role, ADARs also play a major part in immune response to viral infection, where an interferon response activates interferon-stimulated genes, such as ADARp150, in turn dynamically regulating host-virus interactions. A previous report has shown that infection from reoviruses, despite strong activation of ADARp150, does not influence the editing of some of the major known editing targets, while likely editing others, suggesting a potentially nuanced editing pattern that may depend on different factors. However, the results were based on a handful of selected editing sites and did not cover the entire transcriptome. Thus, to determine whether and how reovirus infection specifically affects host ADAR editing patterns, we analyzed a publicly available deep-sequenced RNA-seq dataset, from murine fibroblasts infected with wild-type and mutant reovirus strains that allowed us to examine changes in editing patterns on a transcriptome-wide scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first transcriptome-wide report on host editing changes after reovirus infection. Our results demonstrate that reovirus infection induces unique nuanced editing changes in the host, including introducing sites uniquely edited in infected samples. Genes with edited sites are overrepresented in pathways related to immune regulation, cellular signaling, metabolism, and growth. Moreover, a shift in editing targets has also been observed, where the same genes are edited in infection and control conditions but at different sites, or where the editing rate is increased for some and decreased for other differential targets, supporting the hypothesis of dynamic and condition-specific editing by ADARs.",

    "abstract": "Poisoning with organophosphorus compounds, which can lead to a cholinergic crisis due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and the subsequent accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh) in the synaptic cleft, is a serious problem for which treatment options are currently insufficient. Our approach to broadening the therapeutic spectrum is to use agents that interact directly with desensitized nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in order to induce functional recovery after ACh overstimulation. Although MB327, one of the most prominent compounds investigated in this context, has already shown positive properties in terms of muscle force recovery, this compound is not suitable for use as a therapeutic agent due to its insufficient potency. By means of in silico studies based on our recently presented allosteric binding pocket at the nAChR, i.e. the MB327-PAM-1 binding site, three promising 4-aminopyridinium ion-substituted MB327 analogs (PTM0056, PTM0062 and PTM0063) were identified. In this study, we present the synthesis and biological evaluation of a series of new 4-aminopyridinium ion-substituted analogs of the aforementioned compounds (PTM0064-PTM0072), as well as hydroxy-substituted analogs of MB327 (PTMD90-0012 and PTMD90-0015) designed to substitute energetically unfavorable water clusters identified during molecular dynamics simulations. The compounds were characterized in terms of their binding affinity towards the aforementioned binding site by applying the UNC0642 MS Binding Assays and in terms of their muscle force reactivation in rat diaphragm myography. More potent compounds were identified compared to MB327, as some of them showed a higher affinity towards MB327-PAM-1 and also a higher recovery of neuromuscular transmission at lower compound concentrations. To improve the treatment of organophosphate poisoning, direct targeting of nAChRs with appropriate compounds is a key step, and this study is an important contribution to this research.",

    "abstract": "This study focuses on RU-1205, a new kappa-opioid agonist exhibiting analgesic effect without causing dysphoric or aversive reactions. It is assumed that the absence of dysphoric or aversive effects can be attributed to functional selectivity or it might be due to an additional mechanism of action that involves blocking the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK).\n\nThe aimof this study was the experimental identification of the mechanisms of action of RU-1205 associated with inhibition of MAPK p38 and functional selectivity at kappa-opioid receptors.\n\nMaterials and methodsRats weighing 260-280 g were implanted with chronic cortical and deep electrodes. LFP activity was recorded after intracerebroventricular administration of well-studied reference substances: the selective kappa-opioid agonist U-50488 at a dose of 100 g; the MAPK p38 blocker SB203580 at a dose of 1 g; and the investigational compound RU-1205 at 350 g. The weighted phase lag index (WPLI) was calculated. Subsequently, machine learning techniques were employed to reduce dimensionality and extract connectivity features using the principal component analysis method. Finally, signal classification was conducted using models based on Gaussian processes.\n\nBy applying the patch-clamp technique in the whole-cell configuration, the spike activity of pyramidal neurons in the basolateral amygdala was studied. The neurons were identified by their accommodation properties. After local perfusion of the test compounds, 3 dose-response curves were obtained for: (1) U-50488 at concentrations ranging from 0.001 to 10 M; (2) combinations of U-50488 (0.001-10 M) and RU-1205 (10 M); and (3) combinations of U-50488 (0.01-10 M) and RU-1205 (100 M).\n\nResultsThe developed models were able to classify the compound RU-1205 as a <<non-inhibitor>> of MAPK p38 with a probability of 0.89. The results obtained were confirmed in patch clamp experiments on acute brain slices, where it was demonstrated that U-50488 statistically significantly increases the spike activity of pyramidal neurons in the basolateral amygdala (p <0.05) and RU-1205 interacts with U-50488, suppressing its effect on the spike activity of neurons.\n\nConclusionsThe findings suggest that compound RU-1205 displays properties consistent with a functional kappa opioid receptor agonist and does not have a significant effect on MAPK p38. The study demonstrates the possibility of integrating electrophysiological measurements and advanced data analysis methods for a deep understanding of neuronal mechanisms of drug action and underscores the potential for further research in this area.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe human PIK3R1 Y657* mutation impairs phosphoinositide 3-kiase (PI3K) activation, producing insulin resistance (IR) and reduced adiposity but, surprisingly, no fatty liver or dyslipidaemia. Mice heterozygous for Pik3r1 Y657* metabolically phenocopy humans, moreover exhibiting increased energy expenditure. We suggest that this protects from lipotoxicity despite IR, and here investigate its cause.\n\nMethodsPik3r1Y657*/WT (Pik3r1Y657*) mice and wild-type (WT) littermates single-caged at 21 or 30{degrees}C were fed a 45% high-fat diet for 3 weeks. Body composition, food intake, metabolic efficiency, energy expenditure and physical activity were determined. Body temperature and tail heat loss were assessed by infrared imaging, thermal insulation by a modified Scholander experiment, and total Uncoupling Protein 1 (Ucp1)-dependent thermogenic capacity by determining peak norepinephrine-induced oxygen consumption.\n\nResultsPik3r1Y657* mice at 21{degrees}C showed higher energy expenditure than WT mice that was not fully explained by concomitant increase in food intake, nor by changes in physical activity, all as previously reported. No changes were seen in body temperature, tail vein heat dissipation, nor thermal insulation. Moreover, Ucp1-dependent thermogenesis was unaltered. Housing at 30{degrees}C did not alter the metabolic phenotype of male Pik3r1Y657* mice, but lowered physical activity and energy expenditure in females. Ucp1-dependent thermogenic capacity at 30{degrees}C was unchanged in Pik3r1Y657* mice compared to WT.\n\nConclusionsThe  energy leak that we suggest is metabolically protective in Pik3r1-related IR in mice and humans is not caused by Ucp1-mediated BAT hyperactivation, nor by impaired thermal insulation. Further metabolic studies are now required to seek alternative explanations such as non Ucp1-mediated futile cycling within or among metabolically important tissues.",

PE is associated with placental ischemia, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, oxidative stress (OS), and organ damage in the kidneys and brain. This study aims to characterize a new model of PE using IUGR rats from hypertensive placental ischemic dams. It is hypothesized that pregnant IUGR rats from hypertensive placental ischemic dams will have elevated blood pressure (BP), OS, and organ damage.\n\nMethodsPregnant Sprague Dawley rats are divided into 2 groups: normal pregnant (NP) and reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) hypertensive placental ischemic dams. Offspring from NP and RUPP dams were mated at 10 weeks of age to generate pregnant IUGR (IUGR Preg; n=3-8) and pregnant CON (CON Preg; n=3-6) rats. BP and other markers of PE were evaluated during late gestation.\n\nResultsPregnant IUGR rats had elevated BP and systemic OS, as demonstrated by higher trending 8-isoprostanes and lower circulating antioxidant capacity. Maternal body weight of pregnant IUGR rats and their pups weights were decreased, while the brains were enlarged. Brain OS was elevated, with a rise in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and heat shock protein 1 (HSP- 1), along with lower Manganese Superoxide Dismutase (MnSOD) and antioxidant capacity.\n\nConclusionPregnant IUGR rats, born from hypertensive placental ischemic dams, have HTN and increased systemic and brain OS, with larger brain sizes and smaller pups. Pregnant IUGR rats exhibit an preeclamptic-like phenotype, which suggests a new epigenetic model of PE.",

Microglial Gi-protein coupled receptors (Gi-GPCRs) play a critical role in microglia-neuron communications. However, the impact of temporally activating microglial Gi signaling on microglial dynamics and neuronal activity in the homeostatic brain remains largely unknown. In this study, we employed Gi-based Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (Gi-DREADD) to selectively and temporally modulate microglial Gi signaling pathway. By integrating this chemogenetic approach with in vivo two-photon imaging, we observed that exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling transiently inhibited microglial process dynamics, reduced neuronal activity, and impaired neuronal synchronization. These altered neuronal functions were associated with a decrease in interactions between microglia and neuron somata. Altogether, this study demonstrates that acute, exogenous activation of microglial Gi signaling can regulate neuronal circuit function, offering a potential pharmacological target for neuromodulation through microglia.",

To understand how CSF-1R-mutation affects human microglia - the specialized brain-resident macrophages of the central nervous system - and the downstream consequences for neuronal cells, we used a macrophage and forebrain organoid co-culture system based on induced pluripotent stem cells generated from two patients with HDLS, with CSF-1R gene-corrected isogenic organoids as controls. Macrophages derived from iPSC (iMacs) of patients exhibited a metabolic shift towards the glycolytic pathway and reduced CSF-1 sensitivity, which was associated with higher levels of IL-1{beta} production and an activated inflammatory phenotype. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed that iMacs adopt a reactive state that leads to impaired regulation of neuronal cell populations in organoid cultures, thereby identifying microglial dysregulation and specifically IL-1{beta} production as key contributors to the degenerative neuro-environment in HDLS.",

    "abstract": "Genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition are distinct approaches to unravelling pain mechanisms, identifying targets and developing new analgesics. Both approaches have been applied to the voltage-gated sodium channels Nav1.7 and Nav1.8. Genetic deletion of Nav1.8 in mice leads to a loss of pain, and antagonists are effective analgesics. Complete embryonic loss of Nav1.7 in humans or in mouse sensory neurons leads to profound analgesia substantially mediated by endogenous opioid signaling, and anosmia that is opioid independent. Autonomic function appears to be normal. Adult deletion of Nav1.7 in sensory neurons also leads to analgesia with diminished sensory neuron excitability but there is no opioid component of analgesia. Pharmacological inhibition of Nav1.7 leads to dramatic side-effects on the autonomic nervous system. Here we compare and contrast the distinct embryonic and adult null mechanisms of Nav1.7 loss-of-function analgesia. We describe an endogenous opioid mechanism of analgesia that provides new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and pain relief.\n\nSummaryIn contrast to Nav1.8, Nav1.7, a genetically validated human pain target is unsuitable for small molecule drug development because of its wide spread expression both centrally and peripherally.",

The opposing requirements for optimizing each objective results in a trade-off that forces single cells to prioritize their metabolic needs and optimally allocate limited resources. To define metabolic objectives and tradeoffs in biological systems mathematically, we integrated bulk and single-cell omics data with a novel framework to infer cell objectives using metabolic modeling and machine learning. We validated this framework by identifying essential genes from CRISPR-Cas9 screens in embryonic stem cells, and by inferring the metabolic objectives of quiescent cells and during different cell-cycle phases. Applying this to embryonic cell states, we observed a decrease in metabolic entropy upon development. We further uncovered a trade-off between glutathione and biosynthetic precursors in 1-cell zygote, 2-cell embryo, and blastocyst cells, potentially representing a trade-off between pluripotency and proliferation.",

    "abstract": "Microorganisms encoding for the N2O reductase (NosZ) are the only known biological sink of the potent greenhouse gas N2O, and are central to global N2O mitigation efforts. Yet, the ecological constraints selecting for different N2O-reducers strains and controlling the assembly of N2O-respiring communities remain largely unknown. Of particular biotechnological interest are clade II NosZ populations, which usually feature high N2O affinities and often lack other denitrification genes. Two planktonic N2O-respiring mixed cultures were enriched under limiting and excess dissolved N2O availability to assess the impact of substrate affinity and N2O cytotoxicity, respectively. Genome-resolved metaproteomics was used to infer the metabolism of the enriched populations. We show that clade II N2O-reducers outcompete clade I affiliates for N2O at sufficiently low sludge dilution rates (0.006 h-1), a scenario previously only theorized based on pure-cultures. Under N2O limitation, all enriched N2O-reducers encoded and expressed only clade II NosZ, while also possessing other denitrification genes. Two Azonexus and Thauera genera affiliates dominated the culture. We explain their coexistence with the genome-inferred metabolic exchange of cobalamin intermediates. Conversely, under excess N2O, clade I and II populations coexisted. Notably, the single dominant N2O-reducer (genus Azonexus) expressed most cobalamin biosynthesis marker genes, likely to contrast the continuous cobalamin inactivation by dissolved cytotoxic N2O concentrations (400 {micro}M). Ultimately, we demonstrate that the solids dilution rate controls the selection among NosZ clades, albeit the conditions selecting for genomes possessing the sole nosZ remain elusive. Additionally, we suggest the significance of N2O-cobalamin interactions in shaping the composition of N2O-respiring microbiomes.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian tissues feed on nutrients in the blood circulation. At the organism-level, mammalian energy metabolism comprises of oxidation, interconverting, storing and releasing of circulating nutrients. Though much is known about the individual processes and nutrients, a holistic and quantitative model describing these processes for all major circulating nutrients is lacking. Here, by integrating isotope tracer infusion, mass spectrometry, and isotope gas analyzer measurement, we developed a framework to systematically quantify fluxes through these processes for 10 major circulating energy nutrients in mice, resulting in an organism-level quantitative flux model of energy metabolism. This model revealed in wildtype mice that circulating nutrients metabolic cycling fluxes are more dominant than their oxidation fluxes, with distinct partition between cycling and oxidation flux for individual circulating nutrients. Applications of this framework in obese mouse models showed on a per animal basis extensive elevation of metabolic cycling fluxes in ob/ob mice, but not in diet-induced obese mice.

    "abstract": "BackgroundIntracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the major causes of ischemic stroke and associated with high risk of stroke recurrence. There are no reliable and specific fluid biomarkers for ICAD, and little is known about the proteomic profiling of ICAD. In this study we aimed to explore the feasibility of applying proteomics technology to profile intracranial atherosclerotic plaques extracted from postmortem human brain arteries.\n\nMethodsEighteen segments (5-10mm in length) of major arteries from 10 postmortem brains were collected from the Mount Sinai Neuropathology Brain Bank. Among these segments, 5 had no evidence of atherosclerotic disease, and 13 had wall thickening or visible plaques with various degree of stenosis. Proteins were extracted from the vessel segments, quantified, and digested into peptides. Subsequently, the peptides underwent tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling, pooling, and analysis using two-dimensional liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/LC-MS/MS). Protein identification and quantification were performed using the JUMP software. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were defined as proteins with p.adj < 0.05 and absolute log2 (fold change) > log2 (1.2).\n\nResultsA total of 7,492 unique proteins were detected, and 6,726 quantifiable proteins were retained for further analysis. Among these, 265 DEPs, spanning on 252 unique gene, were found to be associated with ICAD by comparing the arterial segments with vs those without atherosclerotic disease. The top 4 most significant DEPs include LONP1, RPS19, MRPL12 and SNU13. Among the top 50 DEPs, FADD, AIFM1 and PGK1 were associated with atherosclerotic disease or cardiovascular events in previous studies. Moreover, the previously reported proteins associated with atherosclerosis such as APCS, MMP12, CTSD were elevated in arterial segments with atherosclerotic changes. Furthermore, the up-regulation of APOE and LPL, the ICAD GWAS risk genes, was shown to be associated with the plaque severity. Finally, gene set enrichment analysis revealed the DEP signature is enriched for biological pathways such as chromatin structure, plasma lipoprotein, nucleosome, and protein-DNA complex, peroxide catabolic and metabolic processes, critical in ICAD pathology.\n\nConclusionsDirect proteomic profiling of fresh-frozen intracranial artery samples by MS-based proteomic technology is a feasible approach to identify ICAD-associated proteins, which can be potential biomarker candidates for ICAD. Further plaque proteomic study in a larger sample size is warranted to uncover mechanistic insights into ICAD and discover novel biomarkers that may help to improve diagnosis and risk stratification in ICAD.",

    "abstract": "Population surveys are vital for wildlife management, yet traditional methods often demand excessive time and resources, leading to data gaps for many species. Modern technologies such as drones can facilitate field surveys but may also increase data analysis challenges. Citizen Science (CS) can address this issue by engaging non-specialists for data collection and analysis. We evaluated CS for population monitoring using the endangered Galapagos marine iguana as a case study, assessing online volunteers ability to detect and count animals in aerial images. Comparing against a Gold Standard dataset of expert counts in 4345 images, we explored optimal aggregation methods from CS inputs, considering image quality and filtering data from infrequent and anonymous participants. During three phases of our project -- hosted on the Zooniverse platform -- over 13,000 volunteers made 1,375,201 classifications from 57,838 aerial images; each being independently classified 20 (phases 1 & 2) or 30 (phase 3) times. Volunteers achieved 68% to 94% accuracy in detecting iguanas, with more false negatives than false positives. Image quality strongly influenced accuracy; by excluding data from suboptimal pilot-phase images, volunteers counted with 90% to 92% of accuracy. For detecting presence or absence of iguanas, the commonly used  majority vote aggregation approach (where the answer selected is that given by the majority of individual inputs) produced less accurate results than when a minimum threshold of five (from the 20/30 independent classifications) was used. For counting iguanas, HDBSCAN clustering yielded the best results. Excluding inputs from anonymous and inexperienced volunteers decreased accuracy. We conclude that online volunteers can accurately identify and count marine iguanas from drone images, though a tendency to underestimate warrants further consideration. CS-based data analysis is faster than manual counting but still resource-intensive, underscoring the need to develop a Machine Learning approach.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivePhase-amplitude coupling (PAC), the coupling of the amplitude of a faster brain rhythm to the phase of a slower brain rhythm, plays a significant role in brain activity and has been implicated in various neurological disorders. For example, in Parkinsons disease, PAC between the beta (13-30 Hz) and gamma (50-200 Hz) rhythms in the motor cortex is exaggerated, while in Alzheimers disease, PAC between the theta (4-8 Hz) and gamma rhythms is diminished. Modulating PAC (i.e. reducing or enhancing PAC) using brain stimulation could therefore open new therapeutic avenues. However, while it has been previously reported that phase-locked stimulation can increase PAC, it is unclear what the optimal stimulation strategy to modulate PAC might be. Here, we provide a theoretical framework to narrow down the experimental optimisation of stimulation aimed at modulating PAC, which would otherwise rely on trial and error.\n\nApproachWe make analytical predictions using a Stuart-Landau model, and confirm these predictions in a more realistic model of coupled neural populations.\n\nMain resultsOur framework specifies the critical Fourier coefficients of the stimulation waveform which should be tuned to optimally modulate PAC. Depending on the characteristics of the amplitude response curve of the fast population, these components may include the slow frequency, the fast frequency, combinations of these, as well as their harmonics. We also show that the optimal balance of energy between these Fourier components depends on the relative strength of the endogenous slow and fast rhythms, and that the alignment of fast components with the fast rhythm should change throughout the slow cycle. Furthermore, we identify the conditions requiring to phase-lock stimulation to the fast and/or slow rhythms.\n\nSignificanceTogether, our theoretical framework lays the foundation for guiding the development of innovative and more effective brain stimulation aimed at modulating PAC for therapeutic benefit.",

    "abstract": "Classic immunometabolic switching from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to glycolysis occurs in myeloid cells such as microglia when encountering pathogenic insults. We previously showed that patient iPSC-derived microglia (iPS-Mg) harbouring the Alzheimers disease (AD) TREM2R47H hypomorph display deficits in the ability to metabolically switch from OXPHOS to glycolysis, with both reduced mitochondrial maximal respiration and glycolytic capacity. To resolve this, we generated common variant, TREM2R47H and TREM2-/- variant human iPS-Mg and we assessed the ability of supplementation with citrate or succinate, key metabolites and cell cycle breaking points upon microglia activation, to overcome deficits in a number of functions we identified previously as affected by TREM2 loss of function phenotypes. Succinate supplementation was more effective than citrate at overcoming mitochondrial deficits in OXPHOS and did not promote a switch to glycolysis. Citrate enhanced the lipid content of TREM2R47H iPS-Mg and was more effective at overcoming phagocytic deficits whereas succinate increased lipid content and phagocytic capacity in TREM2-/- iPS-Mg. Microglia cytokine release upon activation was differentially affected by citrate or succinate and neither metabolite altered soluble TREM2 shedding. Neither citrate nor succinate enhanced glycolysis but drove their effects through oxidative phosphorylation. Our data point to discrete pathway linkage between microglial metabolism and functional outcomes with implications for AD pathogenesis and treatments.",

    "abstract": "Internal representations of continuous variables are crucial to create internal models of the external world. A prevailing model of how brain maintains these representations is given by continuous bump attractor networks (CBANs). CBANs have been hypothesized as an underlying mechanism in a broad range of brain functions across different areas, such as spatial navigation in hippocampal/entorhinal circuits and working memory in prefrontal cortex. Through recurrent connections, a CBAN maintains a persistent activity bump, whose peak location can vary along a neural space, corresponding to different values of a continuous variable. To track the value of a continuous variable changing over time, a CBAN updates the location of its activity bump based on inputs that encode the changes in the continuous variable (e.g., movement velocity in the case of spatial navigation) - a process akin to mathematical integration. This integration process is not perfect and accumulates error over time. For error correction, CBANs can use additional inputs providing ground-truth information about the continuous variables correct value (e.g., visual landmarks for spatial navigation). These inputs enable the network dynamics to automatically correct any representation error by shifting the activity bump toward the correct location. Recent experimental work on hippocampal place cells has shown that, beyond correcting errors, groundtruth inputs (e.g., visual landmarks) also fine-tune the gain of the integration process, a crucial factor that links the change in the continuous variable (e.g., movement velocity) to the updating of the activity bumps location. However, existing CBAN models lack this plasticity, offering no insights into the neural mechanisms and representations involved in the recalibration of the integration gain. In this paper, we explore this gap by using a ring attractor network, a specific type of CBAN, to model the experimental conditions that demonstrated gain recalibration in hippocampal place cells. Our analysis reveals the neural mechanisms behind gain recalibration within a CBAN: Unlike error correction, which occurs through network dynamics based on ground-truth inputs, gain recalibration requires an additional neural signal that explicitly encodes the error in the networks representation. This error signal must be provided by some neurons whose firing rate varies monotonically with respect to one of two signals-- either the instantaneous error or the time-integral of the error--for recalibration of the integration gain. Finally, we propose a modified ring attractor network as an example CBAN model that verifies our theoretical findings. Combining an error-rate code with Hebbian synaptic plasticity, this model achieves recalibration of integration gain in a CBAN, ensuring accurate representation for continuous variables.",

    "abstract": "Face masks provide fundamental protection against the transmission of respiratory viruses but hamper communication. We estimated auditory and visual obstacles generated by face masks on communication by measuring the neural tracking of face-to-face speech. To this end, we recorded the EEG while participants were exposed to naturalistic audio-visual speech, embedded in multi-talker noise, in three contexts: (i) no-mask (audio-visual information was fully available), (ii) virtual mask (occluded lips, but intact audio), and (iii) real mask (occluded lips and degraded audio). The neural tracking of lip movements and the sound envelope of speech was measured through backward modeling, that is, by reconstructing stimulus properties from neural activity. Behaviorally, face masks increased listening -phonological-errors in speech content retrieval and perceived listening difficulty. At the neural level, we observed that the occlusion of the mouth abolished lip tracking and dampened neural tracking of the speech envelope at the earliest processing stages. Degraded acoustic information due to face mask filtering altered neural tracking at later processing stages instead. Finally, a consistent link emerged between the increment of listening perceived difficulty and the drop in reconstruction performance of speech envelope when attending to a speaker wearing a face mask. Results clearly dissociated the visual and auditory impacts of face masks on face-to-face neural tracking of speech. While face masks hampered the ability to predict and integrate audio-visual speech, the auditory filter generated by face masks impacted the neural processing stages typically associated with auditory selective attention. The link between perceived difficulty and neural tracking drop provided evidence of a major impact of face masks on the metacognitive levels subtending speech processing.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe avoidance of aversive stimuli due to negative reinforcement learning is critical for survival in real-world environments, which demand dynamic responding to both positive and negative stimuli that often conflict with each other. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) commonly exhibit impaired negative reinforcement and extinction, perhaps involving deficits in amygdala functioning. An amygdala subregion of particular interest is the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala (ITC) which has been linked to negative reinforcement and extinction, with distinct clusters mediating separate aspects of behavior. This study focuses on the dorsal ITC cluster (ITCd) and its role in negative reinforcement during a complex behavior that models real-world dynamic decision making.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the impact of ITCd function on negative reinforcement and extinction by applying fiber photometry measurement of GCamp6f signals and optogenetic manipulations during a platform-mediated avoidance task in a mouse model of OCD-like behavior: the Sapap3-null mouse.\n\nResultsWe find impaired neural activity in the ITCd of male and female Sapap3-null mice to the encoding of negative stimuli during platform-mediated avoidance. Sapap3-null mice also exhibit deficits in extinction of avoidant behavior, which is modulated by ITCd neural activity.\n\nConclusionsSapap3-null mice fail to extinguish avoidant behavior in platform-mediated avoidance, due to heightened ITCd activity. This deficit can be rescued by optogenetically inhibiting ITCd during extinction. Together, our results provide insight into the neural mechanisms underpinning negative reinforcement deficits in the context of OCD, emphasizing the necessity of ITCd in responding to negative stimuli in complex environments.",

To address this question, we used simultaneous two-photon calcium imaging and targeted two-photon optogenetics to probe barrel cortex activity during a perceptual discrimination task. Head-fixed mice discriminated bilateral whisker deflections and reported decisions by licking left or right. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed sparse coding of contralateral and ipsilateral whisker input in layer 2/3 while most neurons did not show task-related activity. Activating small groups of pyramidal neurons using two-photon holographic photostimulation evoked a perceptual bias that scaled with the number of neurons photostimulated. This effect was dominated by the optogenetic activation of a small number of non-coding neurons, which did not show sensory or motor-related activity during task performance. Patterned photostimulation also revealed potent recruitment of cortical inhibition during sensory processing, which strongly and preferentially suppressed non-coding neurons.

    "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a relentlessly progressive and fatal disease, caused by the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons within the brain and spinal cord in the ageing human. The dying neurons contain cytoplasmic inclusions linked to the onset and progression of the disease. Here, we use a Drosophila model of ALS8 (VAPP58S) to understand the modulation of these inclusions in the ageing adult brain.\n\nThe adult VAPP58S fly shows progressive deterioration in motor function till its demise 25 days post-eclosion. The density of VAPP58S-positive brain inclusions is stable for 5-15 days of age. In contrast, adding a single copy of VAPWT to the VAPP58S animal leads to a large decrease in inclusion density with concomitant rescue of motor function and lifespan. ER stress, a contributing factor in disease, shows reduction with ageing for the disease model. Autophagy, rather than the Ubiquitin Proteasome system, is the dominant mechanism for aggregate clearance.\n\nWe explored the ability of Drosophila Valosin-containing protein (VCP/TER94), the ALS14 locus, which is involved in cellular protein clearance, to regulate age-dependent aggregation. Contrary to expectation, TER94 overexpression increased VAPP58S punctae density, while its knockdown led to enhanced clearance. Expression of a dominant positive allele, TER94R152H, further stabilised VAPP58S puncta, cementing roles for an ALS8-ALS14 axis. Our results are explained by a mechanism where autophagy is modulated by TER94 knockdown.\n\nOur study sheds light on the complex regulatory events involved in the neuronal maintenance of ALS8 aggregates, suggesting a context-dependent switch between proteasomal and autophagy-based mechanisms as the larvae develop into an adult. A deeper understanding of the nucleation and clearance of the inclusions, which affect cellular stress and function, is essential for understanding the initiation and progression of ALS.",

Our findings revealed that black bullheads exhibit higher consumption of carcass prey in complex habitat and clear water condition. We also provide evidence of the active predatory behavior displayed by black bullheads, as a greater consumption of live prey was observed in simple habitat and turbid water. We did not find any relationship between individual exploratory behavior and the choice between carcass and live prey in black bullheads. Our results suggest that the choice between scavenging versus predatory foraging strategy under varying environmental conditions is influenced by the behavior of both consumer and prey.

    "abstract": "Placebo analgesia is a widely observed clinical phenomenon. Establishing a robust mouse model of placebo analgesia is needed for careful dissection of the underpinning circuit mechanisms. However, previous studies failed to observe consistent placebo effects in rodent models of chronic pain. We wondered whether strong placebo analgesia can be reverse engineered using general anesthesia-activated neurons in the central amygdala (CeAGA) that can potently suppress pain. Indeed, in both acute and chronic pain models, pairing a context with CeAGA-mediated pain relief produced robust context-dependent analgesia, exceeding that induced by morphine in the same paradigm. We reasoned that if the analgesic effect was dependent on reactivation of CeAGA neurons by conditioned contextual cues, the analgesia would still be an active treatment, rather than a placebo effect. CeAGA neurons indeed receive monosynaptic inputs from temporal lobe areas that could potentially relay contextual cues directly to CeAGA. However, in vivo imaging showed that CeAGA neurons were not re-activated in the conditioned context, despite mice displaying a strong analgesic phenotype, supporting the notion that the cue-induced pain relief is true placebo analgesia. Our results show that conditioning with activation of a central pain-suppressing circuit is sufficient to engineer placebo analgesia, and that purposefully linking a context with an active treatment could be a means to harness the power of placebo for pain relief.",

    "abstract": "Under certain conditions, fungi are capable to fast (down to seconds) change the size of their cells. For example, it is known that the cells of many species of yeasts under hyperosmosis instantly and reversibly shrink entirely, without plasmolysis, with a decrease in volume of up to 40% or more. There is limited data that filamentous fungi can also instantly change the diameter of their unspecialized hyphae. This property is fundamental and is a powerful tool for survival and preservation of the physiological functions of the fungus in sharply changing external conditions, but requires detailed study. In this work, which is a large-scale (more than 50,000 cells measured) light microscopic study, the ability of three unrelated basidiomycete species to fast change the diameter of their hyphae under the influence of various factors was analyzed. It was found, for example, that all three fungi respond similarly to moderate hyperosmotic shock and shrink by an average of 12-14% in diameter, but inhibitors of actin assembly can cause both expansion and shrinkage of hyphae, or have no effect on a fungus. Combining the current results with those previously obtained in the study of macroinvagination systems of the fungal plasma membrane, different approaches for basidiomycetes to respond to sudden stress changes were proposed. The previously presented curtain model has also been advanced. The model describes a general mechanism for the rapid regulation of hyphal sizes, which involves the elastic properties of the cell wall, adhesion of the plasma membrane to it, regulation of turgor, a system of actin cables that regulate the tension of the plasma membrane and cell size, as well as a complex system of macroinvaginations of the plasma membrane, ensuring constant integrity and functionality of the latter.",

    "abstract": "For protein coding genes to emerge de novo from a non-genic DNA, the DNA sequence must gain an open reading frame (ORF) and the ability to be transcribed. The newborn de novo gene can further evolve to accumulate changes in its sequence. Consequently, it can also elongate or shrink with time. Existing literature shows that older de novo genes have longer ORF, but it is not clear if they elongated with time or remained of the same length since their inception. To address this question we developed mathematical model of ORF elongation as a Markov-jump process, and show that ORFs tend to keep their length in short evolutionary timescales. We also show that if change occurs it is likely to be a truncation. Our genomics and transcriptomics data analyses of seven Drosophila melanogaster populations is also in agreement with the models prediction. We conclude that selection could facilitate ORF length extension that may explain why longer ORFs were observed in old de novo genes in studies analysing longer evolutionary time scales.\n\nSignificanceNew protein coding genes can emerge from non-genic DNA through a process called de novo gene emergence. Genes thus emerged usually have a small open reading frame (ORF). However, studies show that de novo genes with an older evolutionary origin have longer ORF than younger genes. To understand how ORF length evolves, we use a combination of mathematical modeling and population level genome data analysis. We find that in the absence of evolutionary selection, ORFs tend to become shorter than becoming longer. Therefore, long ORFs are probably selected by evolution to be retained in the genome.",

    "abstract": "The outcome of a viral infection depends on a complex interplay between the host physiology and the virus, mediated through numerous protein-protein interactions. In a previous study we used high-throughput yeast two-hybrid (HT-Y2H) to identify proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana that bind to the proteins encoded by the turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) genome. Furthermore, after experimental evolution of TuMV lineages in plants with mutations in defense-related or proviral genes, most mutations observed in the evolved viruses affected the VPg cistron. Among these mutations, D113G was a convergent mutation selected in many lineages across different plant genotypes. In contrast, mutation R118H specifically emerged in the jin1 mutant with affected jasmonate signaling. Using the HT-Y2H system, we analyzed the impact of these two mutations on VPgs interaction with plant proteins. Interestingly, both mutations severely compromised the interaction of VPg with the translation initiation factor eIF(iso)4E, a crucial interactor for potyvirus infection. Moreover, mutation D113G, but not R118H, adversely affected the interaction with RHD1, a zinc-finger homeodomain transcription factor involved in regulating DNA demethylation. Our results suggest that RHD1 enhances plant tolerance to TuMV infection.",

    "abstract": "More than 60% of all animal species are insects that undergo complete metamorphosis. The key innovation of these holometabolous insects is a pupal stage between the larva and adult when most structures are completely rebuilt. Why this extreme lifestyle evolved is unclear. Here we test the hypothesis that a trade-off between growth and differentiation explains the evolution of this novelty. Using a comparative approach, we find that holometabolous insects grow much faster than hemimetabolous insects. Using a theoretical model, we then show how holometaboly evolves under a growth-differentiation trade-off and identify conditions under which such temporal decoupling of growth and differentiation is favored. Our work supports the notion that the holometabolous life history evolved to remove developmental constraints on fast growth, primarily under high mortality.",

We targeted a frequent loss-of-function, DYSF exon 44, founder frameshift mutation with mRNA-mediated delivery of SpCas9 in combination with a mutation-specific sgRNA to primary muscle stem cells from two homozygous patients. We observed a consistent >60% exon 44 re-framing, rescuing a full-length and functional dysferlin protein. A new mouse model harboring a humanized Dysf exon 44 with the founder mutation, hEx44mut, recapitulated the patients phenotype and an identical re-framing outcome in primary muscle stem cells. Finally, gene-edited murine primary muscle stem-cells were able to regenerate muscle and rescued dysferlin when transplanted back into hEx44mut hosts. These findings are the first to show that a CRISPR-mediated therapy can ameliorate dysferlin deficiency.

    "abstract": "Degradation of motor control across the adult lifespan due to neurobiological decay is well-established. Correspondences between the dynamics of motor behaviour and the timing of musical performance are also well-documented. In light of the former, the conspicuous absence of age as a mediating factor in investigation of the latter reveals a remarkable gap in our understanding of creative performance across the life course. To examine effects of ageing on musical timing, physical tempo of almost 2000 songs released by top-tier recording artists over their decades-long careers were annotated via a listening and tapping task. A series of regression analyses revealed i) an age-driven downward trend in performance tempo for all artists, ii) significant between-artist variation across time, and iii) within-artist variation that was independent of broader musical trends. Overall, tempo decreased by almost one and a half standard deviations from artists early twenties to their late fifties, a rate of decline comparable to that observed in studies of spontaneous motor tempo. Results are consistent with the slowing-with-age hypothesis, and reveal that, not only is such tempo decline discernible in commercial recordings, the impact of age on tempo is overwhelming for artists most physically connected with their music.",

Nevertheless, our daily experiences suggest that colored materials appear to have the same color in shadows even though the reflected light from the material might be very different. Two experiments were conducted to reveal mechanisms that support human color constancy in cast shadows. In all experiments we built a real scene that consisted of colored hexagons illuminated by two independent liquid crystal projectors simulating \"sunlight\" and \"skylight\", respectively. A part of the scene included a cast shadow under which observers were instructed to change the luminance and the chromaticity of a test field so that it appeared as a full-white paper under the shadow. The color of the skylight was manipulated, testing if our visual system uses a prior that the skylight is typically bluish or yellowish to achieve color constancy. We also created a condition where a cast shadow is not recognized as a shadow. Results showed that color constancy generally holds well in shadows and changing skylight color had little effect. Recognizing a cast shadow as a shadow also had no effect. Overall, these results are consistent with our daily experiences that we stably judge objects color even in shadows, providing a key step to reveal mechanisms of color perception in real-world scenes where lighting conditions spatially vary.",

    "abstract": "Most broad-scale forest biodiversity indicators are based on data from national forest inventories and are used to assess the state of biodiversity through several regional initiatives and reporting. Although valuable, these indicators are essentially indirect and evaluate habitat quantity and quality rather than biodiversity per se. Besides, most of these indicators are applicable at regional or national scales, while their use at a more local level is difficult. Therefore, their link to biodiversity may be weak, which decreases their usefulness for decision-making.\n\nFor several decades, Forest Europe indicators assessed the state of European forests, in particular its biodiversity. However, no extensive study has been conducted to date to assess the performance of these indicators against multitaxonomic data. We hypothesized that - as implied by the reporting process - no single biodiversity indicator from Forest Europe can represent overall forest biodiversity, but that several - eventually combined - indicators would reflect habitat quality for at least some taxa in a comprehensive way. We tested the set of indicators proposed by Forest Europe against the species richness of six taxonomic and functional groups (tracheophytes, epixylic and epiphytic bryophytes, birds, saproxylic beetles, saproxylic non-lichenized fungi and epixylic and epiphytic lichenized fungi) across several hundreds of plots over Europe. We showed that, while some indicators perform relatively well across groups (e.g. deadwood volume), no single indicator represented all biodiversity at once, and that a combination of several indicators performed better. Surprisingly, some indicators showed weak links with the biodiversity of the six taxonomic and functional groups.\n\nForest Europe indicators were chosen for their availability and ease of understanding for most people. However, our analyses showed that there are still gaps in the monitoring framework, and that surveying certain taxa along with stand structure is necessary to support policymaking and tackle forest biodiversity loss at the large scale.\n\nImpact statementBiodiversity indicators used to assess the state of Europes forests perform unequally; a combination of indicators is more informative",

Recent advances in deep learning have aimed to address this, but may not adequately learn the biophysical model of RNA folding. Many deep learning approaches are also too complex, incorporating multi-model systems, ensemble strategies, or requiring external data like multiple sequence alignments. In this study, we demonstrate that a single deep learning model, relying solely on RNA sequence input, can effectively learn a biophysical model and outperform existing deep learning methods in standard benchmarks, as well as achieve comparable results to methods that utilize multi-sequence alignments. We dub this model RNAformer and achieve these benefits by a two-dimensional latent space, axial attention, and recycling in the latent space. Further, we found that our model performance improves when we scale it up. We also demonstrate how to refine a pre-trained RNAformer with fine-tuning techniques, which are particularly efficient when applied to a limited amount of high-quality data. A further aspect of our work is addressing the challenges in dataset curation in deep learning, especially regarding data homology. We tackle this through an advanced data processing pipeline that allows for training and evaluation of our model across various levels of sequence similarity.

    "abstract": "The spatial structures of various cell types in tumor tissues have been demonstrated to be able to provide useful information for the evaluation of the disease progression as well as the responsiveness to targeted therapies. Therefore, powered by machine-learning, several image segmentation methods have been developed to identify tumor-cells, stromal, lymphocytes, etc., in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained pathological images. However, the quantitative and systematic characterization of the spatial structures of various cell types is still challenging. In this work, we first developed a robust procedure based on deep learning to precisely recognize cancer cells, stromal and lymphocytes in H&E-stained pathological images of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In order to quantitatively characterize the composition and spatial arrangement of the tumor microenvironment, we then systematically constructed 109 spatial features based on locations of the 3 major types of cells in the H&E images. Interestingly, we discovered that the absolute values of several spatial features are significantly associated with patient overall survival in two independent patient cohorts, such as the cellular diversity around stromal cells (StrDiv), the average distance between stromal cells (StrDis), the coefficient of variation of the tumor-cell polygon area in the Voronoi diagram (TumCV), etc., based on univariate analysis. In addition, multivariate Cox regress analyses further demonstrated that StrDiv and StrDis are independent survival prognostic factors for HCC patient from The Cancer Genome Atlas Program (TCGA). Furthermore, we demonstrated that a combination analysis with cell spatial features, i.e. StrDiv or TumCV, and another important clinical feature, i.e. microvascular invasion (MVI), can further improve the efficacy of prognostic stratification for patients from the Beijing Hospital cohorts. In summary, the spatial features of tumor microenvironment enabled by the digital image analysis pipeline developed in this work can be effective in patient stratification, which holds the promise for its usage in predicting the therapeutic response of patients in the future.",

    "abstract": "Cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of frozen hydrated specimens is an efficient method for the structural analysis of purified biological molecules. However, for particles smaller than 50kDa, single particle cryo-EM often fails due to the limited imaging contrast of individual micrographs. For dose-resilient samples often studied in the physical sciences, electron ptychography - a coherent diffractive imaging technique using 4D scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) - has recently demonstrated resolution down to tens of picometers for thin specimens imaged at room temperature.\n\nHere we applied ptychographic data analysis to frozen hydrated single protein particles, reaching sub-nanometer resolution 3D reconstructions. We employed low-dose cryo-EM with an aberration-corrected, convergent electron beam to collect 4D-STEM data for our reconstructions. The high speed of the electron detector allowed us to record large datasets of electron diffraction patterns with substantial overlaps between the interaction volumes of adjacent scan position, from which the scattering potentials of the samples were iteratively reconstructed. The reconstructed micrographs show strong contrast enabling the reconstruction of the structure of apoferritin protein at up to 5.8 [A] resolution. Ptychography is a promising tool to study the structure of smaller frozen hydrated protein particles, and, once combined with electron tomography tilt series, bears the potential to provide unique insight into the ultrastructure of vitrified biological tissue.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensation via phase separation of proteins and nucleic acids has emerged as a crucial mechanism underlying the spatiotemporal organization of cellular components into functional membraneless organelles. However, aberrant maturation of these dynamic, liquid-like assemblies into irreversible gel-like or solid-like aggregates is associated with a wide range of fatal neurodegenerative diseases. New tools are essential to dissect the changes in the internal material properties of these biomolecular condensates that are often modulated by a wide range of factors involving the sequence composition, truncations, mutations, post-translational modifications, and the stoichiometry of nucleic acids and other biomolecules. Here, we employ homo-Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (homoFRET) as a proximity ruler to study intermolecular energy migration that illuminates the molecular packing in the nanometric length-scale within biomolecular condensates. We used the homoFRET efficiency, measured by a loss in the fluorescence anisotropy due to rapid depolarization, as a readout of the molecular packing giving rise to material properties of biomolecular condensates. Using single-droplet anisotropy imaging, we recorded spatially-resolved homoFRET efficiencies of condensates formed by fluorescent protein-tagged Fused in Sarcoma (FUS). By performing single-droplet picosecond time-resolved anisotropy measurements, we were able to discern various energy migration events within the dense network of polypeptide chains in FUS condensates. Our homoFRET studies also captured the modulation of material properties by RNA, ATP, and post-translational modification. Additionally, we utilized mammalian cell lines stably expressing FUS to study nuclear FUS and oxidative stress-induced stress granule formation in the cytoplasm. Our studies demonstrate that spatially-resolved homoFRET methodology offers a potent tool for studying intracellular phase transitions in cell physiology and disease.",

During diel light/dark growth, dark respiration significantly lowers the overall photosynthetic carbon yield in cyanobacteria and other phototrophs. Currently, it is unclear how photosynthetic organisms allocate carbon resources at night for optimal dark survival. Here we show in the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 that phosphoketolase and 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG) aldolase are orchestrated in an integrative respiratory network in the dark to best allocate carbon resource for amino acid synthesis and preparation for photosynthesis reinitiation upon photoinduction. We further show that the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway is incomplete in S. elongatus with the KDPG aldolase participating in dark respiration through an alternative decarboxylation activity. Optimization of dark respiration thus represents a unique strategy to enhance photosynthetic carbon yield in cyanobacteria and other photosynthetic organisms.",

    "abstract": "The influence of SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein in the hosts tissue-specific complexities remains a mystery and needs more in-depth attention because of COVID-19 recurrence and long COVID. Here we investigated the influence of SARS-CoV-2 transmembrane protein NSP6 (Non-structural protein 6) in three major organs - the brain, heart, and lung in silico. To elucidate the interplay between NSP6 and host proteins, we analyzed the protein-protein interaction network of proteins interacting with NSP6 interacting proteins. Reported host interacting partners of NSP6 were ATP5MG, ATP6AP1, ATP13A3, and SIGMAR1. Pathway enrichment analyses provided global insights into biological pathways governed by differentially regulated genes in the three tissues after COVID-19 infection. Hub genes of tissue-specific protein interactome were analysed for drug targets and many were found. miRNA-gene network for the tissue-specific regulated proteins was sought. Comparing this list with the gene list targetted by SARS-CoV-2 regulated miRNAs, we found three and two common genes in the brain and lung respectively. Among the five common proteins revealed as potential therapeutic targets across the three tissues, four non-approved drugs and one approved drug could target Galectin 3 (LGALS3) and AIFM1 respectively. Increased expression of LGALS3 (that was upregulated in the heart after COVID-19 infection) is observed in multiple cancers and acts as a modulator for tumor progression. COVID-19 infection also causes myocardial inflammation and heart failure (HF). HF is observed to be increasing cancer incidence. The present scenario of long COVID-19 and recurrent COVID-19 infections warrants in-depth studies to probe the effect of COVID-19 infection on increased cancer incidence.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/578752v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (41K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1235495org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8604d5org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a76646org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@2bad2f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

In these studies, Mu Mx1 was stably introduced into chicken DF1 cells to enhance the immune response against AIV. Following infection, titers of AIV were significantly decreased in cells expressing Mu Mx1.

    "abstract": "We have developed a novel class of peptidomimetic inhibitors targeting several host cell human serine proteases including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), matriptase and hepsin. TMPRSS2 is a membrane associated protease which is highly expressed in the upper and lower respiratory tract and is utilized by SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses to proteolytically process their glycoproteins, enabling host cell receptor binding, entry, replication, and dissemination of new virion particles. We have previously shown that compound MM3122 exhibited sub nanomolar potency against all three proteases and displayed potent antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 in a cell-viability assay. Herein, we demonstrate that MM3122 potently inhibits viral replication in human lung epithelial cells and is also effective against the EG.5.1 variant of SARS-CoV-2. Further, we have evaluated MM3122 in a mouse model of COVID-19 and have demonstrated that MM3122 administered intraperitoneally (IP) before (prophylactic) or after (therapeutic) SARS-CoV-2 infection had significant protective effects against weight loss and lung congestion, and reduced pathology. Amelioration of COVID-19 disease was associated with a reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Prophylactic, but not therapeutic, administration of MM3122 also reduced virus titers in the lungs of SARS-CoV-2 infected mice. Therefore, MM3122 is a promising lead candidate small molecule drug for the treatment and prevention of infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.\n\nIMPORTANCESARS-CoV-2 and other emerging RNA coronaviruses are a present and future threat in causing widespread endemic and pandemic infection and disease. In this paper, we have shown that the novel host-cell protease inhibitor, MM3122, blocks SARS-CoV-2 viral replication and is efficacious as both a prophylactic and therapeutic drug for the treatment of COVID-19 in mice. Targeting host proteins and pathways in antiviral therapy is an underexplored area of research but this approach promises to avoid drug resistance by the virus, which is common in current antiviral treatments.",

    "abstract": "It is advantageous for maternally transmitted endosymbionts to skew the sex ratio of their hosts toward females. Some endosymbiotic bacteria such as Wolbachia cause their insect hosts to exclusively produce female offspring through male killing or feminization. In some lepidopteran insects, male killing is achieved by affecting the sex-determining process in males, and a unique mechanism of male killing and its functional link with feminization have been implicated. However, comparative analysis of these phenotypes is often difficult because they have been analyzed in different host-symbiont systems and transinfection of Wolbachia across different hosts is often challenging. In this study, we demonstrated the effects of nine Wolbachia strains on the splicing of sex-determining genes in Lepidoptera by fixing the host genetic background using a cell culture system. Cell transinfection assays confirmed that three male killing-inducing Wolbachia strains and one feminization-inducing Wolbachia strain increased the female-type splicing products of the core sex-determining genes doublesex, masculinizer, and zinc finger protein 2. Regarding Wolbachia strains that do not induce male killing/feminization, three had no effect on these sex-determining genes, whereas two strains induced female-type splicing of masculinizer and doublesex but not zinc finger protein 2. Comparative genomics confirmed that homologs of oscar, the Wolbachia gene responsible for male killing in Ostrinia, were encoded by male killing/feminizing Wolbachia strains, but not by non-male killing/non-feminizing strains. These results demonstrated the conserved effects underlying male killing and feminization induced by oscar-bearing Wolbachia, and suggested other potential mechanisms that Wolbachia might employ to manipulate host sex.\n\nIMPORTANCEArthropods commonly carry maternally transmitted microbial symbionts such as Wolbachia. The lack of paternal transmission frequently led to the evolution of reproductive parasitism traits, namely the manipulation of host reproduction in favor of female hosts, substantiated by male killing and feminization. Although Wolbachia induces these phenotypes in a wide range of insects, the underlying mechanisms, diversity, and commonality remain largely unclear. In this study, we used a combination of transinfection assays and comparative genomics to reveal the conserved effects of male killing and feminizing Wolbachia strains on lepidopteran sex determination. Furthermore, we demonstrated that some non-male killing/non-feminizing Wolbachia strains also have an inherent ability to influence sex determination, albeit in a different manner, suggesting the potential for multiple mechanisms to manipulate host sex. This study also implied the frequent evolution of host suppressors against Wolbachia-induced reproductive manipulation.",

    "abstract": "In some extreme environments, archaeal cells have been shown to have chronic viral infections, and such infections are well-tolerated by the hosts and may potentially protect against more lethal infections by lytic viruses. We have discovered that a natural Haloferax strain (48N), which is closely related to the model organism Haloferax volcanii, is chronically-infected by a lemon-shaped virus, which we could purify from the medium. The chronic infection by this virus, which we named LSV-48N, is never cleared, despite the multiple defense systems of the host that include CRISPR-Cas, and two CBASS systems. Curing 48N of its virus by genetic engineering, led to radical changes in the gene expression profile of 48N and a dramatic improvement in its growth rate. Remarkably, the cured 48N is the fastest-growing haloarchaeon reported to date, with a generation time of approximately 1 hour at 45{degrees}C compared to the typical 2.5 hours of H. volcanii or its infected isogen, and faster than any known haloarchaeon. The virus subverts host defenses by reducing their transcription and interfering with the CRISPR spacer acquisition machinery. Our results suggest that the slow growth of many halophilic archaea could be due to the effects of proviruses within their genomes that consume resources and alter the gene expression of their hosts.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens employ epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, to adapt to environmental changes, and these mechanisms play important roles in various biological processes. Pseudomonas syringae is a model phytopathogenic bacterium, but its methylome is less well known than that of other species. In this study, we conducted single-molecule real-time sequencing to profile the DNA methylation landscape in three model pathovars of P. syringae. We identified one Type-I restriction-modification system (HsdMSR), including the conserved sequence motif associated with N6-methyladenine (6mA). About 25%-40% of the genes involved in DNA methylation were conserved in two or more of the strains, revealing the functional conservation of methylation in P. syringae. Subsequent transcriptomic analysis highlighted the involvement of HsdMSR in virulent and metabolic pathways, including the Type III secretion system, biofilm formation, and translational efficiency. The regulatory effect of HsdMSR on transcription was dependent on both strands being fully 6mA methylated. Overall, this work illustrated the methylation profile in P. syringae and the critical involvement of DNA methylation in regulating virulence and metabolism. Thus, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of epigenetic transcriptional control in P. syringae and related bacteria.",

Most microbes use corrinoids, a structurally diverse family of cofactors related to vitamin B12. Corrinoid structure influences the growth of individual microbes, yet how these growth responses scale to the community level remains unknown. Analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes suggests corrinoids are supplied to the community by members of the archaeal and bacterial phyla Thermoproteota, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. Corrinoids were found largely adhered to the soil matrix in a grassland soil, at levels exceeding those required by cultured bacteria. Enrichment cultures and soil microcosms seeded with different corrinoids show distinct shifts in bacterial 16S composition, supporting the hypothesis that corrinoid structure can shape communities. Environmental context influenced both community and taxon-specific responses to specific corrinoids.

    "abstract": "Despite being among the most abundant biological entities on earth, bacteriophage (phage) remain an understudied component of host-associated systems. One limitation to studying host-associated phage is the lack of consensus on methods for sampling phage communities. Here, we compare paired total metagenomes and viral size fraction metagenomes (viromes) as methods for investigating the dsDNA viral communities associated with the GI tract of two bee species: the European honey bee Apis mellifera and the eastern bumble bee Bombus impatiens. We find that viromes successfully enriched for phage, thereby increasing phage recovery, but only in honey bees. In contrast, for bumble bees, total metagenomes recovered greater phage diversity. Across both bee species, viromes better sampled low abundance and low occupancy phage, while total metagenomes were biased towards sampling temperate phage and the most prominent phage. Additionally, many of the phage captured by total metagenomes were absent altogether from viromes. Comparing between bees, we show that phage communities in commercially reared bumble bees are significantly reduced in diversity compared to honey bees, likely reflecting differences in bacterial titer and diversity. In a broader context, these results highlight the complementary nature of total metagenomes and targeted viromes, especially when applied to host-associated environments. Overall, we suggest that studies interested in assessing total communities of host-associated phage should consider using both approaches. However, given the constraints of virome sampling, total metagenomes may serve to sample phage communities with the understanding that they will preferentially sample dominant and temperate phage.",

    "abstract": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) latency regulation in monocytes and macrophages can vary according to signals directing differentiation, polarization, and function. To investigate these processes, we generated an HIV latency model in THP-1 monocytes and showed differential levels of HIV reactivation among clonal populations. Monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation of HIV-infected primary human CD14+ and THP-1 cells induced HIV reactivation and showed that virus production increased concomitant with macrophage differentiation. We applied the HIV-infected THP-1 monocyte-to- macrophage (MLat) model to assess the biological mechanisms regulating HIV latency dynamics during monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation. We pinpointed PKC signaling pathway activation and Cyclin T1 upregulation as inherent differentiation mechanisms that regulate HIV latency reactivation. Macrophage polarization regulated latency, revealing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages suppressed HIV reactivation while M2 macrophages promoted HIV reactivation. Because macrophages rely on reactive- oxygen species (ROS) to exert numerous cellular functions, we disrupted redox pathways and discovered that inhibitors of the thioredoxin (Trx) system acted as latency promoting agents (LPAs) in T-cells and monocytes, but opposingly acted as latency reversing agents (LRAs) in macrophages. We explored this mechanism with Auranofin, a clinical candidate for reducing HIV reservoirs, and demonstrated Trx reductase (TrxR) inhibition led to ROS induced NF-{kappa}B activity, which promoted HIV reactivation in macrophages, but not in T-cells and monocytes. Collectively, cell type-specific differences in HIV latency regulation could pose a barrier to HIV eradication strategies.",

    "abstract": "The broad tissue distribution and cell tropism of human cytomegalovirus indicates that the virus successfully replicates in tissues with various nutrient environments. HCMV requires and reprograms central carbon metabolism for viral replication. However, many studies focus on reprogramming of metabolism in high nutrient conditions that do not recapitulate physiological nutrient environments in the body. In this study, we investigate how HCMV successfully replicates when nutrients are suboptimal. We limited glucose following HCMV infection to determine how glucose supports virus replication and how nutrients potentially present in the physiological environment contribute to successful glucose independent HCMV replication. Glucose is required for HCMV viral genome synthesis, viral protein production and glycosylation, and virus production. However, supplement of glucose-free cultures with uridine, ribose, or UDP-GlcNAc--metabolites that support upper glycolytic branches--resulted in partially restored viral genome synthesis and subsequent partial restoration of viral protein levels. Low levels of virus production were also restored. Supplementing lower glycolysis in glucose-free cultures using pyruvate had no effect on virus replication. These results indicate nutrients that support upper glycolytic branches like the pentose phosphate pathway and hexosamine pathway can compensate for glucose during HCMV replication to support low levels of virus production. More broadly, our findings suggest that HCMV could successfully replicate in diverse metabolic niches, including those in the body with low levels of glucose, through alternative nutrient usage.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe metabolic environment is a determinant in the ability of a virus to successfully replicate. HCMV has broad cell tropism and replicates in various tissues that have diverse and/or limiting metabolic environments. We know that HCMV reprograms host central carbon metabolism to support viral replication, but we have little understanding of HCMV replication in diverse metabolic niches as most studies use high nutrient culture media. Here, we show that glucose limitation suppresses virus production through loss of viral genome synthesis and viral protein glycosylation. However, nutrient compensation by uridine, ribose, and UDP-GlcNAc, metabolites that fuel upper glycolytic branches such as the non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathway support low levels of glucose-independent virus production. Our work indicates that metabolite compensation may facilitate HCMV replication in nutrient limited niches in the body.",

    "abstract": "Host metabolic fitness is a critical determinant of infectious disease outcomes. In COVID-19, obesity and aging are major high-risk disease modifiers, although the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), a critical regulator of metabolic dysfunction in these conditions, regulates SARS-CoV2 pathogenesis. Our study revealed that elevated FABP4 levels in COVID-19 patients strongly correlate with disease severity. In adipocytes and airway epithelial cells we found that loss of FABP4 function by genetic or pharmacological means impaired SARS-CoV2 replication and disrupted the formation of viral replication organelles. Furthermore, treatment of infected hamsters with FABP4 inhibitors alleviated lung damage and fibrosis and reduced lung viral titers. These results highlight a novel host factor critical for SARS-CoV2 infection and the therapeutic potential of FABP4-targeting agents in treating COVID-19 patients.",

    "abstract": "The small RNA (sRNA) RydC strongly activates cfa, which encodes the cyclopropane fatty acid synthase. Previous work demonstrated that RydC activation of cfa increases conversion of unsaturated fatty acids to cyclopropanated fatty acids in membrane lipids and changes the biophysical properties of membranes, making cells more resistant to acid stress. The conditions and regulators that control RydC synthesis had not previously been identified. In this study, we demonstrate that RydC regulation of cfa is important for resistance to membrane-disrupting conditions. We identify a GntR-family transcription factor, YieP, that represses rydC transcription and show that YieP indirectly regulates cfa through RydC. YieP positively autoregulates its own transcription. We further identify additional sRNA regulatory inputs that contribute to control of RydC and cfa. The translation of yieP is repressed by the Fnr-dependent sRNA, FnrS, making FnrS an indirect activator of rydC and cfa. Conversely, RydC activity on cfa is antagonized by the OmpR-dependent sRNA OmrB. Altogether, this work illuminates a complex regulatory network involving transcriptional and post-transcriptional inputs that link control of membrane biophysical properties to multiple environmental signals.\n\nImportanceBacteria experience many environmental stresses that challenge their membrane integrity. To withstand these challenges, bacteria sense what stress is occurring and mount a response that protects membranes. Previous work documented the important roles of small RNA (sRNA) regulators in membrane stress responses. One sRNA, RydC, helps cells cope with membrane-disrupting stresses by promoting changes in the types of lipids incorporated into membranes. In this study, we identified a regulator, YieP, that controls when RydC is produced, and additional sRNA regulators that modulate YieP levels and RydC activity. These findings illuminate a complex regulatory network that helps bacteria sense and respond to membrane stress.",

    "abstract": "Infections by Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) cause acute diarrheal disease in infants accounting for severe morbidity and mortality. One of the underlying causes of the disease is the break-down of the intestinal barrier maintained by the tight junctions (TJs). EPEC uses a type 3 secretion system to translocate more than twenty effectors into infected cells which disrupt several functions of the host cells. The effectors EspF, Map, EspG1/G2 and NleA have been reported to disrupt the TJs and cause the leakage of charged ions and uncharged molecules through the barrier. We have reported earlier that EspF and Map cause the depletion of TJ proteins claudin-1, claudin-4 and occludin through both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Here, we show that the EPEC effector Map modulates the lysosomal protease, cathepsin B to deplete claudins and occludin. Expression of mutant Map proteins that lacked the mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) completely restored the total levels of occludin and its localization at the TJs and partially restored claudin-4 levels and its junctional localization. We also identified a novel interaction of Map with the GTPase Rab13. As Rab13 has been reported to mediate the recycling of occludin to the plasma membrane, its interaction with Map has important implications for the loss of TJ integrity in EPEC pathogenesis. Occludin regulates the passage of water and uncharged solutes through TJs and Map may block its recycling to compromise the TJs thus causing excessive leakage through the barrier.",

    "abstract": "Fluorine (19F) NMR is emerging as an invaluable analytical technique in chemistry, biochemistry, material science, and medicine, especially due to the inherent rarity of naturally occurring fluorine in biological, organic, and inorganic compounds. Thus, we were surprised to identify an unexpected peak in our 19F NMR spectra, corresponding to free fluoride, which appears to leach out from various types of new and unused glass NMR tubes over the course of several hours. We quantified this contaminant to be at micromolar concentrations for typical NMR sample volumes across multiple glass types and brands. We find that this artefact is undetectable for samples prepared in quartz NMR tubes within the timeframes of our experiments. We also observed that pre-soaking new glass NMR tubes combined with rinsing removes this contamination below micromolar levels. Given the increasing popularity of 19F NMR across a wide range of fields, the long collection times required for relaxation studies and samples of low concentrations, and the importance of avoiding contamination in all NMR experiments, we anticipate that our simple solution will be useful to biomolecular NMR spectroscopists.",

    "abstract": "Perilipins (PLINs), the most abundant proteins on lipid droplets (LDs), display similar domain organization including amphipathic helices (AH). However, the five human PLINs bind different LDs suggesting different modes of interaction. We established a minimal system whereby artificial LDs covered with defined polar lipids were transiently deformed to promote surface tension. Binding of purified PLIN3 and PLIN4 AH was dependent on tension, even with polar lipids favoring packing defects, and showed an inverse correlation between protein and phospholipid densities on LDs. In contrast, PLIN1 bound readily to LDs fully covered by phospholipids; PLIN2 showed an intermediate behavior. In human adipocytes, PLIN3/4 were found in a soluble pool and relocated to LDs upon stimulation of triglyceride synthesis, whereas PLIN1 and PLIN2 localized to pre-existing LDs, consistent with the huge difference in LD avidity observed in vitro. We conclude that the PLIN repertoire is adapted to handling LDs with different surface properties.\n\nSignificance statementLipid droplets (LDs) are highly dynamic organelles, whose size and surface properties vary during their life-time and also differ between different tissues. Here, we analyze the mode of binding of human perilipins (PLINs), the most abundant LD proteins, to LDs. We have developed a new reconstitution method, which shows that the purified PLIN family members have very different affinities for LDs, which might explain how they handle LDs of different dynamics in the cell.",

    "abstract": "Monkeypox is one of the infectious viruses which caused morbidity and mortality problems in these years. Despite its danger to public health, there is no approved drug to stand and handle Monkeypox. On the other hand, drug repurposing is a promising screening method for the low-cost introduction of approved drugs for emerging diseases and viruses which utilizes computational methods. Therefore, drug repurposing is a promising approach to suggesting approved drugs for the monkeypox virus. This paper proposes a computational framework for monkeypox antiviral prediction. To do this, we have geenrated a new virus-antiviral dataset. Moreover, we applied several machine learning and one deep learning method for virus-antiviral prediction. The suggested drugs by the learning methods have been investigated using docking studies. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first work to study deep learning methods for the prediction of monkeypox antivirals. The screening results confirm that Tilorone, Valacyclovir, Ribavirin, Favipiravir, and Baloxavir marboxil are effective drugs for monkeypox treatment.",

    "abstract": "Super-resolution microscopy and Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) are a powerful tool to characterize synthetic nanomaterials used for many applications such as drug delivery. In the last decade, imaging techniques like STORM, PALM, and PAINT have been used to study nanoparticle size, structure, and composition. While imaging has progressed significantly, often image analysis did not follow accordingly and many studies are limited to qualitative and semi-quantitative analysis. Therefore, it is imperative to have a robust and accurate method to analyze SMLM images of nanoparticles and extract quantitative features from them. Here we introduce nanoFeatures, a cross-platform Matlab-based app for the automatic and quantitative analysis of super-resolution images. NanoFeatures makes use of clustering algorithms to identify nanoparticles from the raw data (localization list) and extract quantitative information about size, shape, and molecular abundance at the single-particle and single-molecule levels. Moreover, it applies a series of quality controls, increasing data quality and avoiding artifacts. NanoFeatures, thanks to its intuitive interface is also accessible to non-experts and will facilitate analysis of super-resolution microscopy for materials scientists and nanotechnologies. This easy accessibility to expansive feature characterization at the single particle level will bring us one step closer to understanding the relationship between nanostructure features and their efficiency. https://github.com/n4nlab/nanoFeatures",

Centromeres are comprised of two types of nucleosomes: canonical nucleosomes containing an octamer of H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones, and CENP-A nucleosomes in which H3 is replaced with its analog CENP-A histone. This modification leads to the difference in the nuclear of DNA turns around the histone core, wrapping efficiency. This value is 121 bp of DNA, considerably less than 147 bp found in canonical nucleosomes. We used Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) to characterize nanoscale features for both types of nucleosomes assembled on the same template, enabling us to evaluate the effect of internucleosomal interaction. We found that CENP-A mononucleosomes have a lower internucleosomal affinity than canonical H3 nucleosomes. We applied time-lapse, high-speed AFM (HS-AFM) to characterize the dynamics of nucleosomes. For both nucleosomes, spontaneous unwrapping of DNA was observed, and this process occurs via a transient state with [~]100 bp DNA wrapped around the core, followed by a rapid dissociation of DNA. The unwrapping process is asymmetric, so when the dissociation starts on one arm, it enlarges the size of the dissociated arm. Additionally, HS-AFM revealed higher stability of CENP-nucleosomes compared with H3 ones, in which dissociation of the histone core occurs prior to the nucleosome dissociation. The histone core of CENP-A nucleosomes remains intact even after the dissociation of DNA.",

We created isogenic MM cells disrupted for KDM6A and tagged the endogenous protein to facilitate genome wide studies. KDM6A binds genes associated with immune recognition and cytokine signaling. Most importantly, KDM6A binds and activates NLRC5 and CIITA encoding regulators of Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) genes. Patient data indicate that NLRC5 and CIITA, are downregulated in MM with low KDM6A expression. Chromatin analysis shows that KDM6A binds poised and active enhancers and KDM6A loss led to decreased H3K27ac at enhancers, increased H3K27me3 levels in body of genes bound by KDM6A and decreased gene expression. Reestablishing histone acetylation with an HDAC3 inhibitor leads to upregulation of MHC expression, offering a strategy to restore immunogenicity of KDM6A deficient tumors.
