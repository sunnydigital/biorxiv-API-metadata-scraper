    "abstract": "Pairwise compatibility between virus and host proteins can dictate the outcome of infection. During transmission, both inter- and intraspecies variabilities in receptor protein sequences can impact cell susceptibility. Many viruses possess mutable viral entry proteins and the patterns of host compatibility can shift as the viral protein sequence changes. This combinatorial sequence space between virus and host is poorly understood, as traditional experimental approaches lack the throughput to simultaneously test all possible combinations of protein sequences. Here, we created a pseudotyped virus infection assay where a multiplexed target-cell library of host receptor variants can be assayed simultaneously using a DNA barcode sequencing readout. We applied this assay to test a panel of 30 ACE2 orthologs or human sequence mutants for infectability by the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein or the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron BA1 variant spikes. We compared these results to an analysis of the structural shifts that occurred for each variant spikes interface with human ACE2. Mutated residues were directly involved in the largest shifts, although there were also widespread indirect effects altering interface structure. The N501Y substitution in spike conferred a large structural shift for interaction with ACE2, which was partially recreated by indirect distal substitutions in Delta, which does not harbor N501Y. The structural shifts from N501Y greatly influenced the set of animal orthologs the variant spike was capable of interacting with. Out of the thirteen non-human orthologs, ten exhibited unique patterns of variant-specific compatibility, demonstrating that spike sequence changes during human transmission can toggle ACE2 compatibility and potential susceptibility of other animal species, and cumulatively increase overall compatibilities as new variants emerge. These experiments provide a blueprint for similar large-scale assessments of protein compatibility during entry by diverse viruses. This dataset demonstrates the complex compatibility relationships that occur between variable interacting host and virus proteins.",

XBB lineage members were noted for their improved immune evasion and transmissibility. Here, we determine cryo-EM structures of XBB.1.5, XBB.1.16 and EG.5 spike (S) ectodomains to reveal enhanced occupancy of the receptor inaccessible closed state. Interprotomer receptor binding domain (RBD) interactions previously observed in BA.1 and BA.2 were retained to reinforce the 3-RBD-down state. Improved stability of XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.16 RBD compensated for loss of stability caused by early Omicron mutations, while the F456L substitution reduced EG.5 RBD stability. Long-range impacts of S1 subunit mutations affected conformation and epitope presentation in the S2 subunit. Taken together, our results feature a theme of iterative optimization of S protein stability as Omicron continues to evolve, while maintaining high affinity receptor binding and bolstering immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) displays a broad cell tropism, and the infection of biologically relevant cells such as epithelial, endothelial, and hematopoietic cells supports viral transmission, systemic spread, and pathogenesis in the human host. HCMV strains differ in their ability to infect and replicate in these cell types, but the genetic basis of these differences has remained incompletely understood. In this study, we investigated HCMV strain VR1814, which is highly infectious for epithelial cells and macrophages and induces cell-cell fusion in both cell types. A VR1814-derived bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone, FIX-BAC, was generated many years ago but has fallen out of favor because of its modest infectivity. By sequence comparison and genetic engineering of FIX, we demonstrate that the high infectivity of VR1814 and its ability to induce syncytium formation in epithelial cells and macrophages depends on VR1814-specific variants of the envelope glycoproteins gB, UL128, and UL130. We also show that UL130-neutralizing antibodies inhibit syncytium formation, and a FIX-specific mutation in UL130 is responsible for its low infectivity by reducing the amount of the pentameric glycoprotein complex in viral particles. Moreover, we found that a VR1814-specific mutation in US28 further increases viral infectivity in macrophages, possibly by promoting lytic rather than latent infection of these cells. Our findings show that variants of gB and the pentameric complex are major determinants of infectivity and syncytium formation in epithelial cells and macrophages. Furthermore, the VR1814-adjusted FIX strains can serve as valuable tools to study HCMV infection of myeloid cells.\n\nImportanceHCMV is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in transplant patients and the leading cause of congenital infections. HCMV infects various cell types, including epithelial cells and macrophages, and some strains induce the fusion of neighboring cells, leading to the formation of large multinucleated cells called syncytia. This process may limit the exposure of the virus to host immune factors and facilitate its spread. However, the reason why some HCMV strains exhibit a broader cell tropism and why some induce cell fusion more than others is not well understood. We compared two closely related HCMV strains and provided evidence that small differences in viral envelope glycoproteins can massively increase or decrease the virus infectivity and its ability to induce syncytium formation. The results of the study suggest that natural strain variations may influence HCMV infection and pathogenesis in humans.",

    "abstract": "Klebsiella pneumoniae, an important opportunistic pathogen, has long been categorized into two distinct pathotypes: the often multidrug-resistant classic (cKp) and the highly virulent hypervirulent (hvKp). However, a recent global trend has witnessed the emergence of convergent strains, seamlessly combining antimicrobial resistance with hypervirulence. Our study delved into a series of K. pneumoniae isolates sourced from the same patient, all belonging to the international, high-risk clonal lineage of sequence type 147. As reported in a previous study, these isolates exhibited diverse morphotypes on blood agar, ranging from small white to normal-sized white, grey, or grey and dry (g/d) colonies.\n\nThrough an interplay of omics and phenotypic experiments, we unraveled the intricate mechanisms governing these distinct colony morphologies and their implications on bacterial virulence and resilience. While the earlier isolates demonstrated modest levels of resistance and virulence, their later counterparts showed significantly heightened levels, attributed to the acquisition of additional plasmids. Bioinformatics analysis unveiled a chromosomal insertion of a hybrid plasmid in one isolate, marking an unprecedented in-host microevolution from the classic to the convergent pathotype.\n\nAll morphotypes exhibited positive insertion sequences around or within the K loci, with the grey or g/d phenotypes arising from impaired K loci. Despite lower serum resistance, these morphotypes demonstrated superior adhesion to human epithelial cells. Interestingly, while capsule-deficient strains are conventionally associated with decreased virulence, our isolates displayed high mortality rates in the Galleria mellonella infection model.\n\nIn conclusion, our findings not only provide unprecedented insights into in-host microevolution within a patient, transitioning from the classic to the convergent pathotype, but also contribute significantly to the understanding of the diverse morphotypes exhibited by K. pneumoniae.",

    "abstract": "Blue light is an important signal for fungal development and is detected by the White Collar complex, which consists of WC-1 and WC-2. Most of our knowledge on this complex is derived from the ascomycete Neurospora crassa, where both WC-1 and WC-2 contain GATA zinc-finger transcription factor domains. In basidiomycetes, WC-1 is truncated and does not contain a transcription factor domain, but both WC-1 and WC-2 are still important for development . In the model mushroom Schizophyllum commune, we show that dimerization of WC-1 and WC-2 happens independent of light, but that induction by light is required for promoter binding by the White Collar complex. Furthermore, the White Collar complex is a promoter of transcription, but binding of the complex alone is not always sufficient to initiate transcription. For its function, the White Collar complex associates directly with the promoters of structural genes involved in mushroom development, like hydrophobins, but also promotes the expression of other transcription factors that play a role in mushroom development.",

    "abstract": "Systemic viral infection of insects typically begins with primary infection of midgut epithelial cells (enterocytes) and subsequent transit of virus in an apical-to-basal orientation through the polarized enterocytes into the hemocoel. In the case of insect-vectored viruses, a similar yet oppositely oriented process (basal-to-apical virus transit) occurs upon secondary infection of salivary glands, and is necessary for virus transmission to non-insect hosts. To examine this inversely oriented virus transit in these polarized tissues, we assessed the intracellular trafficking of two model viral envelope proteins (baculovirus GP64 and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein, VSV G) in the midgut and salivary gland cells of the model insect, Drosophila melanogaster. Using transgenic Drosophila fly lines that inducibly express either GP64 or VSV G, we found that both proteins were trafficked basally in midgut enterocytes. In salivary gland cells, VSV G was trafficked to apical membranes in most but not all cells, whereas GP64 was trafficked consistently to basal membranes. We further examined the mechanism of polarized trafficking in midgut and salivary gland epithelia and found that a cytoplasmic YxxO motif in both VSV G and GP64 proteins is critical for basal trafficking of each envelope protein in midgut enterocytes, but dispensable for their trafficking in salivary gland epithelial cells. Using RNAi, we found that clathrin adapter protein complexes AP1 and AP3, as well as several Rab GTPases (Rab1, 4, 8, 10, 23, 30, and - 35), were involved in polarized VSV G trafficking in midgut enterocytes. Our results indicate that these viral envelope proteins encode the requisite information and require no other viral factors for appropriately polarized trafficking. In addition, they exploit tissue-specific differences in protein trafficking pathways to facilitate virus egress in the appropriate orientation for establishing systemic infections and vectoring infection to other hosts.\n\nAuthor SummaryViruses that use insects as hosts must navigate specific routes through the insects tissues to complete their life cycles. The routes may differ substantially depending on the life cycle of the virus. Some insect pathogenic viruses, such as baculoviruses, establish a systemic infection and this represents an endpoint in the infection cycle in the insect. In contrast, many insect-vectored viruses establish a systemic infection in the insect, but must also deliver infectious virus to the insects non-insect host. In both cases, the virus must first navigate through the midgut epithelium to establish a systemic infection, but insect-vectored viruses must also navigate through the salivary gland epithelium. Both midgut and salivary gland cells are polarized, and insect-vectored viruses appear to traffic in opposite directions in these two tissues. In this study, we asked whether two viral envelope proteins alone encode the signals necessary for polarized trafficking associated with their respective life cycles. Using two representative viral envelope proteins (VSV G and baculovirus GP64) and Drosophila as a model insect to examine tissue-specific polarized trafficking of viral envelope proteins, we identified one of the virus-encoded signals and several host proteins associated with regulating the polarized trafficking in the midgut epithelium.",

    "abstract": "Parallel to the important use of pesticides in conventional agriculture there is a growing interest for green technologies to clear contaminated soil from pesticides and their degradation products. One specific technique, the inoculation of degrading micro-organisms in polluted soil, known as bioaugmentation, is a promising method still in needs of further developments. Specifically, improvements in the understanding of how degrading microorganisms must overcome abiotic filters and interact with the autochthonous microbial communities are needed in order to efficiently design bioremediation strategies. Here we designed a protocol aiming at studying the degradation of two herbicides, glyphosate (GLY) and isoproturon (IPU), via experimental modifications of two source bacterial communities. We used statistical methods stemming from genomic prediction to link community composition to herbicides degradation potentials. Our approach proved to be efficient with correlation estimates over 0.8 - between model predictions and measured pesticide degradation values. OTUs significantly associated with the degradation ability, and therefore identified as relevant by the models were confronted to the literature. Next, multi-degrading bacterial communities were obtained by coalescing bacterial communities with high GLY or IPU degradation ability based on their community-level properties. Finally, we evaluated the efficiency of constructed multi-degrading communities to remove pesticide contamination in a different soil. While results are less clear in the case of GLY, we showed an efficient transfer of degrading capacities towards the receiving soil even at relatively low inoculation levels in the case of IPU. Altogether, we developed an innovative protocol for building multi-degrading simplified bacterial communities with the help of genomic prediction tools and coalescence, and proved their efficiency in a contaminated soil.",

    "abstract": "Microbial interactions in the rhizosphere contribute to soil health. Understanding these interactions thus has the potential to advance sustainable agriculture, ecosystem management, and environmental stewardship. Yet it is difficult to understand what we cannot see; amongst the limitations in rhizosphere imaging are challenges associated with rapidly and non-invasively imaging microbial cells over field depths relevant to plant roots. Here, we present a novel bimodal imaging technique called Complex-field and Fluorescence microscopy using the Aperture Scanning Technique (CFAST) that begins to address these limitations by integrating quantitative phase and 3D fluorescence imaging. We showcase CFASTs practicality and versatility in two ways. First, by harnessing its depth of field of more than 100 microns, we significantly reduce the number of captures required for 3D imaging of plant roots and bacteria in the rhizoplane, thereby minimizing potential photobleaching and phototoxicity. Second, by leveraging CFASTs phase sensitivity and fluorescence specificity, we track early bacterial aggregate development, bacterial competition, and gene expression under varying environmental conditions. Specifically, we resolve bacterial growth dynamics of mixed populations at the early stages of colonization without the need for genetically labeling environmental isolates. Moreover, we find that the expression of genes of interest to rhizosphere chemistry (e.g. representative genes involved in phosphorus-sensing and antibiotic production) varies spatiotemporally within microbial populations that are surface-attached and appears distinct from their expression in planktonic cultures. Together, CFASTs attributes overcome commercial imaging platform limitations and enable new insights to be gained into microbial behavioral dynamics in experimental systems of relevance to the rhizosphere.",

Analogous changes were observed within the homologous gene in parallel experiments with Enterococcus faecalis.

Here we show that surface-attached bacteria use a fundamentally different mode of sensing during chemotaxis. We combined microfluidic experiments, massively parallel cell tracking, and fluorescent reporters to study how Pseudomonas aeruginosa senses chemical gradients during pili-based 'twitching' chemotaxis on surfaces. First, we asked whether surface-attached cells use temporal sensing by exposing them to temporal chemical gradients generated via Taylor-Aris dispersion. However, we find that temporal changes in concentration do not induce changes in motility, indicating that twitching cells do not sense chemical gradients like swimming bacteria do. We, therefore, designed experiments to test whether cells can detect chemical gradients across the length of their bodies. In these experiments, we follow the localisation of a fluorescent protein fusion to quantify the chemotactic behaviour of stationary cells in an alternating chemical gradient. We find that P. aeruginosa cells can directly sense differences in concentration across the lengths of their bodies, even in the presence of strong temporal fluctuations. Our work reveals that P. aeruginosa cells are capable of spatial sensing, thus overturning the widely held notion that bacterial cells are too small to directly sense chemical gradients in space.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are candidates for use against antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. However, due to high cytotoxicity and poor performance in biological contexts, most AMPs are unable to satisfy the requirements. The gut microbiomes of pathogenic species like Blattella germanica represent unexploited reservoirs of naturally evolved biocompatible AMPs. Here we developed a lightweight AI pipeline called AMPidentifer with two nine-layers Dense-Net blocks and one embedded new self-attention module to enable the discovery of biocompatible AMPs from microbiome. The core structure of AMPidentifer is simple, not requiring complexing code basis. On the independent test dataset, it showed robust performance and avoided high false-positive results. From the gut microbiome of B. germanica, new AMP candidates with potential low toxicities and antimicrobial activities were identified by AMPidentifer. The selected two AMPs demonstrated good antimicrobial effects in vitro and in vivo. The Cys residue was demonstrated to perform different action mechanisms in the antimicrobial activity of two AMPs, providing insights for future rational design. New efficient AMPs with low cytotoxicity identified by the new high-throughput AI pipeline from the gut microbiome of B. germanica successfully showed an important interdisciplinary strategy for discovering bio-safe AMPs from nature.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/580024v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@143e033org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@134620dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11809forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1134ef6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOThe Graphic AbstractC_FLOATNO C_FIG",

    "abstract": "CRISPR-Cas systems have moved forward genetic engineering in virtually any organism amenable to genetic modification. In particular, these systems have unlocked unprecedented possibilities to generate mutants in oomycetes, a group of filamentous microbes comprising over two hundred Phytophthora species, including the cacao killer Phytophthora palmivora. Here, we showcase multiplex gene editing in P. palmivora using LbCas12. We have developed a straightforward protocol to simultaneously knock out two genes encoding adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APT), an essential enzyme of the purine salvage pathway. We show that APT knockouts ({Delta}PpATP1/2) are insensitive to 2-fluoroadenine (2-FA) and retain full virulence on Nicotiana benthamiana. We rely on zoospore electroporation using an all-in-one construct to facilitate the rapid editing of multiple genes. This work enhances the genetic toolbox for Phytophthora species and simplifies the exploration of gene function, laying the groundwork for future innovations aiming to tackle oomycete plant diseases.",

    "abstract": "AbstractMetabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide for which there are no approved treatments. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an interesting therapeutical target since it acts as a central regulator of cellular metabolism. Despite efforts to target the AMPK, no direct activators has yet been approved for treatment of this disease. This study investigates the effect of AMPK activator ATX-304 in a preclinical mouse model of progressive fatty liver disease. The data demonstrate that ATX-304 diminishes body fat mass, lowers blood cholesterol levels, mitigates liver steatosis, and ameliorates the development of liver fibrosis. The beneficial effects of ATX-304 treatment are accompanied by a shift in the liver metabolic program, including increased lipid oxidation, reduced lipid synthesis, as well as remodeling of cholesterol and lipid transport. We also observed variations in lipid distribution among liver lobes in response to ATX-304, and a shift in the zonal distribution of lipid droplets upon treatment. Taken together, our data suggest that ATX-304 holds promise as a potential treatment for Metabolically Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD), including in human patients.",

    "abstract": "When replication forks encounter damaged DNA, cells utilize DNA damage tolerance mechanisms to allow replication to proceed. These include translesion synthesis at the fork, postreplication gap filling, and template switching via fork reversal or homologous recombination. The extent to which these different damage tolerance mechanisms are utilized depends on cell, tissue, and developmental context-specific cues, the last two of which are poorly understood. To address this gap, we have investigated damage tolerance responses following alkylation damage in Drosophila melanogaster. We report that translesion synthesis, rather than template switching, is the preferred response to alkylation-induced damage in diploid larval tissues. Furthermore, we show that the REV1 protein plays a multi-faceted role in damage tolerance in Drosophila. Drosophila larvae lacking REV1 are hypersensitive to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and have highly elevated levels of {gamma}-H2Av foci and chromosome aberrations in MMS-treated tissues. Loss of the REV1 C-terminal domain (CTD), which recruits multiple translesion polymerases to damage sites, sensitizes flies to MMS. In the absence of the REV1 CTD, DNA polymerases eta and zeta become critical for MMS tolerance. In addition, flies lacking REV3, the catalytic subunit of polymerase zeta, require the deoxycytidyl transferase activity of REV1 to tolerate MMS. Together, our results demonstrate that Drosophila prioritize the use of multiple translesion polymerases to tolerate alkylation damage and highlight the critical role of REV1 in the coordination of this response to prevent genome instability.\n\nAuthor SummaryOrganisms have evolved several ways to continue copying their DNA when it is damaged, grouped into the categories of translesion synthesis and template switching. These damage tolerance mechanisms prevent replication forks from collapsing when they encounter DNA damage and prevent catastrophic genome instability and cell death. While the proteins and pathways involved in damage tolerance are beginning to be understood at the single cell level, how they are regulated in multicellular organisms is an intriguing question. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Drosophila tolerate alkylation damage during their development. We discovered that tissues containing rapidly dividing diploid cells favor translesion synthesis over template switching, preferentially utilizing different translesion polymerases in a context-dependent manner. Furthermore, we showed that the REV1 protein, best known for its role in recruiting translesion DNA polymerases to damage sites, performs multiple functions during damage tolerance. Together, our results demonstrate that damage tolerance preferences for multicellular organisms may differ from those observed in cultured cells, and establish Drosophila as a useful model system for studying tolerance mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Efflux is one of the mechanisms employed by Gram-negative bacteria to become resistant to routinely used antibiotics. The inhibition of efflux by targeting their regulators is a promising strategy to re-sensitise bacterial pathogens to antibiotics. AcrAB-TolC is the main Resistance-Nodulation-Division efflux pump in Enterobacteriaceae. MarA is an AraC/XylS family global regulator that regulates more than 40 genes related to the antimicrobial resistance phenotype, including acrAB. The aim of this work was to understand the role of the N-terminal helix of MarA in the mechanism of DNA binding. An N-terminal deletion of MarA showed that the N-terminal helix has a role in the recognition of the functional marboxes. By engineering two double cysteine variants of MarA, and combining in vitro electrophoretic mobility assays and in vivo measurements of acrAB transcription with molecular dynamic simulations, it was shown that the immobilization of the N-terminal helix of MarA prevents binding to DNA. This new mechanism of inhibition seems to be universal for the monomeric members of the AraC/XylS family, as suggested by additional molecular dynamics simulations of the two-domain protein Rob. These results point to the N-terminal helix of the AraC/XylS family monomeric regulators as a promising target for the development of inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Malaria pathogenesis and parasite multiplication both depend on the ability of Plasmodium falciparum merozoites to invade human erythrocytes. Invasion is a complex multi-step process that is known to involve multiple P. falciparum proteins but dissecting the precise role of individual proteins has to date been limited by the availability of quantifiable phenotypic assays. In this study, we apply a new approach to assigning function to invasion proteins by using optical tweezers to directly manipulate recently egressed merozoites and erythrocytes and quantify the strength of attachment between them, as well as the frequency with which such attachments occur. Using a range of inhibitors, antibodies, and genetically modified P. falciparum strains, we quantitated the contribution of individual P. falciparum proteins to these merozoite-erythrocyte attachment phenotypes for the first time. Most of the interactions investigated did not affect the force needed to pull merozoites and erythrocytes apart, including loss of the major P. falciparum merozoite surface protein PfMSP1 and PfGAP45, part of the glideosome actinomyosin motor complex. The only factors that significantly reduced the strength of merozoite-erythrocyte attachment were ones that disrupted the function of members of the EBA-175 like Antigen (PfEBA) family and Reticulocyte Binding Protein Homologue (PfRH) invasion ligand families. While these assays also reinforced the known redundancy within these families, with the deletion of some ligands not impacting detachment force, it appears that the PfEBA/PfRH families play a central role in merozoite attachment, not the major merozoite surface protein PfMSP1.\n\nAuthor summaryMalaria is a devastating disease caused by a parasitic infection. The deadliest species is Plasmodium falciparum, which causes more than 600,000 deaths annually. The parasites life cycle is complex, but all the symptoms of malaria are caused when the parasites replicate in human red blood cells. Replication depends on the invasion of the red blood cells by the parasites which is a complex process involving multiple molecular interactions and multiple steps. Invasion begins with the attachment of the parasite to the red blood cell, making this step of particular interest in the development of new therapeutics. We assessed which interactions are key to the strength of attachment using an optical tweezer assay, which allowed us to directly measure the binding force between individual parasites and red blood cells whilst using a range of molecular and genetic tools that target specific interactions known to have a role in invasion. This showed that loss of a protein commonly thought to be critical to the early stages of binding (PfMSP1) had no effect on attachment strength, whereas disruptions of several members from two families of proteins (the Erythrocyte Binding Like protein family and the reticulocyte binding-like protein family) affect attachment strength.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Human Proteome Project has credibly detected nearly 93% of the roughly 20,000 proteins which are predicted by the human genome. However, the proteome is enigmatic, where alterations in amino acid sequences from polymorphisms and alternative splicing, errors in translation, and post-translational modifications result in a proteome depth estimated at several million unique proteoforms. Recently mass spectrometry has been demonstrated in several landmark efforts mapping the human proteoform landscape in bulk analyses. Herein, we developed an integrated workflow for characterizing proteoforms from human tissue in a spatially resolved manner by coupling laser capture microdissection, nanoliter-scale sample preparation, and mass spectrometry imaging.\n\nResultsUsing healthy human kidney sections as the case study, we focused our analyses on the major functional tissue units including glomeruli, tubules, and medullary rays. After laser capture microdissection, these isolated functional tissue units were processed with microPOTS (microdroplet processing in one-pot for trace samples) for sensitive top-down proteomics measurement. This provided a quantitative database of 616 proteoforms that was further leveraged as a library for mass spectrometry imaging with near-cellular spatial resolution over the entire section. Notably, several mitochondrial proteoforms were found to be differentially abundant between glomeruli and convoluted tubules, and further spatial contextualization was provided by mass spectrometry imaging confirming unique differences identified by microPOTS, and further expanding the field-of-view for unique distributions such as enhanced abundance of a truncated form (1-74) of ubiquitin within cortical regions.\n\nConclusionsWe developed an integrated workflow to directly identify proteoforms and reveal their spatial distributions. Where of the 20 differentially abundant proteoforms identified as discriminate between tubules and glomeruli by microPOTS, the vast majority of tubular proteoforms were of mitochondrial origin (8 of 10) where discriminate proteoforms in glomeruli were primarily hemoglobin subunits (9 of 10). These trends were also identified within ion images demonstrating spatially resolved characterization of proteoforms that has the potential to reshape discovery-based proteomics because the proteoforms are the ultimate effector of cellular functions. Applications of this technology have the potential to unravel etiology and pathophysiology of disease states, informing on biologically active proteoforms, which remodel the proteomic landscape in chronic and acute disorders.",

    "abstract": "Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is the 46th most abundant human protein with many functions whose dysregulation leads to various cancers. Pentameric NPM1 resides in the nucleolus but can also shuttle to the cytosol. NPM1 is regulated by multisite phosphorylation, yet molecular consequences of site-specific NPM1 phosphorylation remain elusive. Here we identify four 14-3-3 protein binding sites in NPM1 concealed within its oligomerization and -helical C-terminal domains that are found phosphorylated in vivo. By combining mutagenesis, in-cell phosphorylation and PermaPhos technology for site-directed incorporation of a non-hydrolyzable phosphoserine mimic, we show how phosphorylation promotes NPM1 monomerization and partial unfolding, to recruit 14-3-3 dimers with low-micromolar affinity. Using fluorescence anisotropy we quantified pairwise interactions of all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms with four recombinant NPM1 phosphopeptides and assessed their druggability by fusicoccin. This revealed a complex hierarchy of 14-3-3 affinities toward the primary (S48, S293) and secondary (S106, S260) sites, differentially modulated by the small molecule. As three of these 14-3-3 binding phospho-sites in NPM1 reside within signal sequences, this work highlights a key mechanism of NPM1 regulation by which NPM1 phosphorylation promotes 14-3-3 binding to control nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. It also provides further evidence that phosphorylation-induced structural rearrangements of globular proteins serve to expose otherwise cryptic 14-3-3-binding sites that are important for cellular function.",

    "abstract": "Biomolecular condensates are cellular compartments that concentrate biomolecules without an encapsulating membrane. In recent years, significant advances have been made in the understanding of condensates through biochemical reconstitution and microscopic detection of these structures. Quantitative visualization and biochemical assays of biomolecular condensates rely on surface passivation to minimize background and artifacts due to condensate adhesion. However, the challenge of undesired interactions between condensates and glass surfaces, which can alter material properties and impair observational accuracy, remains a critical hurdle. Here, we introduce an efficient, generically applicable, and simple passivation method employing self-assembly of the surfactant Pluronic F127 (PF127). The method greatly reduces nonspecific binding across a range of condensates systems for both phase-separated droplets and biomolecules in dilute phase. Additionally, by integrating PF127 passivation with the Biotin-NeutrAvidin system, we achieve controlled multi-point attachment of condensates to surfaces. This not only preserves condensate properties but also facilitates long-time FRAP imaging and high-precision single-molecule analyses. Using this method, we have explored the dynamics of polySIM molecules within polySUMO/polySIM condensates at the single-molecule level. Our observations suggest a potential heterogeneity in the distribution of available polySIM-binding sites within the condensates.\n\nSignificance StatementThe understanding of biomolecular condensates has significantly benefited from biochemical reconstitution with microscopy detection. Here, we present a novel surface passivation method utilizing self-assembly of Pluronic F127 on hydrophobic surfaces. This approach not only effectively minimizes non-specific binding without altering the physical properties of the condensates but also offers universal passivation across a variety of condensate systems. It demonstrates high resistance to different treatments and enables condensate immobilization through controlled anchor points. This allows for highly sensitive analytical techniques, including single-molecule imaging. The simplicity and high-performance of this method, coupled with time and cost efficiencies, could facilitate robustness and throughput of experiments, and could broaden the accessibility of biochemical phase separation studies to a wider scientific community.",

Systemic and quantitative measurement of tryptophan is crucial for evaluating its essential role as a precursor of serotonin and kynurenine, key neuromodulators affecting neural and immune functions. We utilized a robust and highly responsive ratiometric indicator for tryptophan (GRIT) to quantitatively measure tryptophan dynamics in bacteria, mitochondria of mammalian cell cultures, and human serum. At the cellular scale, these analyses uncovered differences in tryptophan dynamics across cell types and organelles. At the whole-organism scale, we revealed that inflammation-induced tryptophan concentration increases in zebrafish brain led to elevated tryptophan metabolites serotonin and kynurenine levels, which is associated with the prolonged sleep duration. The reduction of zebrafish plasma tryptophan was mirrored in patients with inflammation symptoms and could serve as a biochemical marker of inflammation. In summary, this study introduces GRIT as a powerful method for studying tryptophan metabolism and functions across scales and species and suggests that tryptophan metabolic processes link the immune response and animal behavior.",

Genome-edited human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer the uniique potential to advance our understanding of PD etiology by providing disease-relevant cell-types carrying patient mutations along with isogenic control cells. To facilitate this experimental approach, we generated a collection of 55 cell lines genetically engineered to harbor mutations in genes associated with monogenic PD (SNCA A53T, SNCA A30P, PRKN Ex3del, PINK1 Q129X, DJ1/PARK7 Ex1-5del, LRRK2 G2019S, ATP13A2 FS, FBXO7 R498X/FS, DNAJC6 c.801 A>G+FS, SYNJ1 R258Q/FS, VPS13C A444P, VPS13C W395C, GBA1 IVS2+1). All mutations were generated in a fully characterized and sequenced female human embryonic stem cell (hESC) line (WIBR3; NIH approval number NIHhESC-10-0079) using CRISPR/Cas9 or prime editing-based approaches. We implemented rigorous quality controls, including high density genotyping to detect structural variants and confirm the genomic integrity of each cell line. This systematic approach ensures the high quality of our stem cell collection, highlights differences between conventional CRISPR/Cas9 and prime editing and provides a roadmap for how to generate gene-edited hPSCs collections at scale in an academic setting. We expect that our isogenic stem cell collection will become an accessible platform for the study of PD, which can be used by investigators to understand the molecular pathophysiology of PD in a human cellular setting.",

The complete loss of a sensory modality is among the most extreme such experiences. Investigating such a selective, yet extreme change in experience allows for the characterization of experience-based plasticity at its boundaries.\n\nHere, we investigated information processing in individuals who lost vision at birth or early in life by probing the processing of braille letter information. We characterized the transformation of braille letter information from sensory representations depending on the reading hand to perceptual representations that are independent of the reading hand.\n\nUsing a multivariate analysis framework in combination with fMRI, EEG and behavioral assessment, we tracked cortical braille representations in space and time, and probed their behavioral relevance.\n\nWe located sensory representations in tactile processing areas and perceptual representations in sighted reading areas, with the lateral occipital complex as a connecting \"hinge\" region. This elucidates the plasticity of the visually deprived brain in terms of information processing.\n\nRegarding information processing in time, we found that sensory representations emerge before perceptual representations. This indicates that even extreme cases of brain plasticity adhere to a common temporal scheme in the progression from sensory to perceptual transformations.\n\nAscertaining behavioral relevance through perceived similarity ratings, we found that perceptual representations in sighted reading areas, but not sensory representations in tactile processing areas are suitably formatted to guide behavior.\n\nTogether, our results reveal a nuanced picture of both the potentials and limits of experience-dependent plasticity in the visually deprived brain.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe rapid development of cefiderocol resistance poses a significant concern, particularly in Enterobacterales that produce New Delhi metallo-{beta}-lactamase (NDM). This study explores the potential of inhibiting the development of cefiderocol resistance by combining cefiderocol with aztreonam.\n\nMethodsA resistance induction experiment using 20 clinical isolates was performed to assess the impact of cefiderocol-aztreonam on preventing cefiderocol resistance development at 4x and 10x cefiderocol MIC, with and without aztreonam (2, 4, 8 {micro}g/ml). Additionally, serial passaging with doubling cefiderocol concentrations was performed with and without aztreonam. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to identify potential genetic factors associated with the phenotype.\n\nResultsAmong the 20 E. cloacae complex isolates, 40% (8/20) exhibited a significant reduction in cefiderocol MIC ([&ge;]4-fold MIC reduction) in the presence of 4 {micro}g/ml aztreonam. Combining cefiderocol with a fixed concentration of 4 {micro}g/ml aztreonam inhibited cefiderocol resistance development in these eight isolates at an inoculum of 107 cfu/ml. Additional resistance induction experiments through serial passaging indicated a delayed emergence of cefiderocol-resistant clones when cefiderocol was combined with aztreonam. WGS analysis revealed a significant positive association between blaCTX-M-15, blaOXA-1, and other co-localized genes with a substantial MIC reduction for cefiderocol-aztreonam compared to cefiderocol alone.\n\nConclusionOur study suggested that cefiderocol resistance development in NDM-producing E. cloacae complex can be delayed or inhibited by combining cefiderocol with aztreonam, even in the presence of multiple {beta}-lactamase genes. A MIC reduction of at least 4-fold emerges as the most reliable predictor for inhibiting resistance development with this dual {beta}-lactam combination.",

However, difficulties in data analysis comprise one of the main reasons that hinder the standardization of NMR for metabolomic analysis in research. In this work, we applied an automated workflow for NMR-based metabolomic analysis for the study of vernalization in strawberry. Vernalization is a key process in obtaining a successful strawberry crop, however, the molecular mechanisms behind it remain still unknown.

    "abstract": "AimsThis study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of diving reflex, a powerful endogenous mechanism supporting underwater mammalian survival. Antioxidative responses, observed in marine mammals, may be contributing factors. Using a multi-organ approach, this study assesses whether acute and chronic diving reflex activate nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling pathways, which regulate cellular antioxidant responses.\n\nMethodsMale Sprague-Dawley rats (n=38) underwent either a single diving session to elicit acute diving reflex, or daily diving sessions for 4-weeks to produce chronic diving reflex. NRF2 (total, nuclear, phosphorylated), NRF2-downstream genes, and malondialdehyde were assessed via Western blot, immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and ELISA in brain, lung, kidney, and serum.\n\nResultsDiving reflex increased nuclear NRF2, phosphorylated NRF2, and antioxidative gene expression, in an organ-specific and exposure time-specific manner. Comparing organs, the brain had the highest increase of phosphorylated NRF2 expression, while kidney had the highest degree of nuclear NRF2 expression. Comparing acute and chronic sessions, phosphorylated NRF2 increased the most with chronic diving reflex, but acute diving reflex had the highest antioxidative gene expression. Notably, calcitonin gene-related peptide appears to mediate diving reflex effects on NRF2 activation.\n\nConclusionsAcute and chronic diving reflex activate potent NRF2 signaling in the brain and peripheral organs. Interestingly, acute diving reflex induces higher expression of downstream antioxidative genes compared to chronic diving reflex. This result contradicts previous assumptions requiring chronic exposure to diving for induction of antioxidative effects and implies that the diving reflex has a strong translational potential during preconditioning and postconditioning therapies.\n\nKey PointsO_LIDiving reflex activates potent NRF2 signaling via multiple mechanisms, including phosphorylation, nuclear translocation, and KEAP1 downregulation with both acute and chronic exposure.\nC_LIO_LIDiving reflex activates NRF2 via differential pathways in the brain and other organs; phosphorylated NRF2 increases more in the brain, while nuclear NRF2 increases more in the peripheral organs.\nC_LIO_LIAcute diving reflex exposure induces a more pronounced antioxidative effect than chronic diving reflex exposure, indicating that the antioxidative response activated by diving reflex is not dependent upon chronic adaptive responses and supports diving reflex as both a preconditioning and postconditioning treatment.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Over the last few decades, novel methods have been developed to study how chromosome positioning within the nucleus may play a role in gene regulation. Adaptation of these methods in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, has recently led to the discovery that the three-dimensional structure of chromatin within the nucleus may be critical in controlling expression of virulence genes (var genes). Recent work has implicated an unusual, highly conserved var gene called var2csa in contributing to coordinated transcriptional switching, however how this gene functions in this capacity is unknown. To further understand how var2csa influences var gene switching, targeted DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) within the sub-telomeric region of chromosome 12 were used to delete the gene and the surrounding chromosomal region. To characterize the changes in chromatin architecture stemming from this deletion and how these changes could affect var gene expression, we used a combination of RNA-seq, Chip-seq and Hi-C to pinpoint epigenetic and chromatin structural modifications in regions of differential gene expression. We observed a net gain of interactions in sub-telomeric regions and internal var gene regions following var2csa knockout, indicating an increase of tightly controlled heterochromatin structures. Our results suggest that disruption of var2csa results not only in changes in var gene transcriptional regulation but also a significant tightening of heterochromatin clusters thereby disrupting coordinated activation of var genes throughout the genome. Altogether our result confirms a strong link between the var2csa locus, chromatin structure and var gene expression.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYMalaria remains one of the deadliest parasite-borne diseases, causing not only over a half million deaths annually, but also infecting hundreds of millions more. Plasmodium falciparum, the protozoan parasite that is responsible for the most virulent form of human malaria, is transmitted to humans by infected female mosquitoes during a blood meal. Due to a growing resistance to all existing antimalarials, there is a need to identify novel targets to design new antimalarial strategies. Our research builds on the growing body of evidence that supports the role of genome organization or chromatin structure within the nucleus in controlling the parasite development as well as virulence factors designed to circumvent the host immune response. This study identifies genes and structural elements within the Plasmodium falciparum genome that are controlled, at least partially, by the expression of a single unique and highly conserved virulence gene.",

Here we systematically disrupt pre-existing helical propensity within the DNA binding region of the homodimeric bZIP domain of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) using Ala-Gly scanning and examine the impact on target binding kinetics. We find that the secondary structure of the transition state strongly resembles that of the unbound state. The closest residue to the dimerisation domain that has been examined is largely folded within both unbound and transition states; dimerisation apparently propagates additional helical propensity into the basic region. The results are consistent with electrostatically-enhanced DNA binding, followed by rapid folding from the folded zipper outwards.

NHL-2 has been shown to interact with U-rich RNA through its NHL domain, but the importance to its biological function is unknown. We defined the crystal structure of the NHL domain to 1.4 [A] resolution and identified residues that affect affinity for U-rich RNA. Functional analysis of an NHL-2 RNA-binding loss-of-function mutant demonstrated defects in the heterochronic pathway, suggesting that RNA binding is essential for its role in this miRNA pathway. Processing bodies were enlarged in the NHL-2 RNA-binding mutant, suggesting a defect in mRNA decay. We also identified the eIF4E binding protein IFET-1 as a strong synthetic interactor with NHL-2 and the DEAD box RNA helicase CGH-1 (DDX6), linking NHL-2 function to translation repression. We demonstrated that in the absence of NHL-2, there was an enrichment of miRNA transcripts associated with the miRNA pathway Argonaute proteins ALG-2 and ALG-2. We demonstrate that NHL-2 RNA-binding activity is essential for let-7 family miRNA-mediated translational repression.

    "abstract": "The third trimester of human gestation is characterised by rapid increases in brain volume and cortical surface area. A growing catalogue of cells in the prenatal brain has revealed remarkable molecular diversity across cortical areas.1,2 Despite this, little is known about how this translates into the patterns of differential cortical expansion observed in humans during the latter stages of gestation. Here we present a new resource, Brain, to facilitate knowledge translation between molecular and anatomical descriptions of the prenatal developing brain. Built using generative artificial intelligence, Brain is a three-dimensional cellular-resolution digital atlas combining publicly-available serial sections of the postmortem human brain at 21 weeks gestation3 with bulk tissue microarray data, sampled across 29 cortical regions and 5 transient tissue zones.4 Using Brain, we evaluate the molecular signatures of preferentially-expanded cortical regions during human gestation, quantified in utero using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We find that differences in the rates of expansion across cortical areas during gestation respect anatomical and evolutionary boundaries between cortical types5 and are founded upon extended periods of upper-layer cortical neuron migration that continue beyond mid-gestation. We identify a set of genes that are upregulated from mid-gestation and highly expressed in rapidly expanding neocortex, which are implicated in genetic disorders with cognitive sequelae. Our findings demonstrate a spatial coupling between areal differences in the timing of neurogenesis and rates of expansion across the neocortical sheet during the prenatal epoch.

    "abstract": "The introduction of next generation sequencing technologies in the clinics has improved rare disease diagnosis. Nonetheless, for very heterogeneous or very rare diseases, more than half of cases still lack molecular diagnosis. Novel strategies are needed to prioritize variants within a single individual. The PSAP (Population Sampling Probability) method was developed to meet this aim but only for coding variants in exome data. To address the challenge of the analysis of non-coding variants in whole genome sequencing data, we propose an extension of the PSAP method to the non-coding genome called PSAP-genomic-regions. In this extension, instead of considering genes as testing units (PSAP-genes strategy), we use genomic regions defined over the whole genome that pinpoint potential functional constraints.\n\nWe conceived an evaluation protocol for our method using artificially-generated disease exomes and genomes, by inserting coding and non-coding pathogenic ClinVar variants in large datasets of exomes and genomes from the general population.\n\nWe found that PSAP-genomic-regions significantly improves the ranking of these variants compared to using a pathogenicity score alone. Using PSAP-genomic-regions, more than fifty percent of non-coding ClinVar variants, especially those involved in splicing, were among the top 10 variants of the genome. In addition, our approach gave similar results compared to PSAP-genes regarding the scoring of coding variants. On real sequencing data from 6 patients with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease and 9 patients with male infertility, all causal variants were ranked in the top 100 variants with PSAP-genomic-regions.\n\nBy revisiting the testing units used in the PSAP method to include non-coding variants, we have developed PSAP-genomic-regions, an efficient whole-genome prioritization tool which offers promising results for the diagnosis of unresolved rare diseases. PSAP-genomic-regions is implemented as a user-friendly Snakemake workflow, accessible to both researchers and clinicians which can easily integrate up-to-date annotation from large databases.\n\nAuthor summaryIn recent years, improvement in DNA sequencing technologies has allowed the identification of many genes involved in rare diseases. Nonetheless, the molecular diagnosis is still unknown for more than half of rare diseases cases. This is in part due to the large heterogeneity of molecular causes in rare diseases. This also highlights the need for the development of new methods to prioritize pathogenic variants from DNA sequencing data at the scale of the whole genome and not only coding regions. With PSAP-genomic-regions, we offer a strategy to prioritize coding and non-coding variants in whole-genome data from a single individual in need of a diagnosis. The PSAP-genomic-regions combines information on the predicted pathogenicity and frequency of variants in the context of functional regions of the genome. In this work, we compare the PSAP-genomic-regions strategy to other variant prioritization strategies on simulated and real data. We show the better performance of PSAP-genomic-regions over a classical approach based on variant pathogenicity scores alone. PSAP-genomic-regions provides a straightforward approach to prioritize causal pathogenic variants, especially non-coding ones, that are often missed with other strategies and could explain the cause of undiagnosed rare diseases.",

Brain monoamines (i.e., serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) have been found to play a role in a variety of behaviors related to risk taking. Genetic variation related to monoamine function have also been linked to personality in both humans and animals. Using zebrafish, we investigated the relationship between monoamine function and boldness behavior during exploration of a novel tank. We found a sex-specific correlation between serotonin metabolism (5-HIAA:5-HT ratio) and boldness that was limited to female animals; there were no relationships between boldness and dopamine or norepinephrine. To probe differences in serotonergic function, we administered a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, escitalopram, to bold and shy fish, and assessed their exploratory behavior. We found that escitalopram had opposing effects on thigmotaxis in female animals with bold fish spending more time near the center of the tank and shy fish spent more time near the periphery. Taken together, our findings suggest that variation in serotonergic function makes sex-specific contributions to individual differences in risk taking behavior.",
