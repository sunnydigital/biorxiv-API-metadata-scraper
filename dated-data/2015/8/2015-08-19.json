    "abstract": "MotivationWe propose a method for estimating lipidome homologies analogous to the ones used in sequence analysis and phylo-genetics.\\n\\nResultsAlgorithms were developed to quantify the structural similarity between lipids and to compute chemical space models of sets of lipid structures and lipidomes. When all lipid molecules of the LIPIDMAPS structure database were mapped in such a chemical space, they automatically formed clusters corresponding to conventional chemical families. Homologies between the lipidomes of four yeast strains based on our LUX score reflected the genetic relationship, although the score is based solely on lipid structures.\\n\\nAvailabilitywww.lux.fz-borstel.de",

    "abstract": "Several strategies have been proposed to assign substitution models in phylogenomic datasets, or partitioning. The accuracy of these methods, and most importantly, their impact on phylogenetic estimation has not been thoroughly assessed using computer simulations. We simulated multiple partitioning scenarios to benchmark two a priori partitioning schemes (one model for the whole alignment, one model for each data block), and two statistical approaches (hierarchical clustering and greedy) implemented in PartitionFinder and in our new program, PartitionTest. Most methods were able to identify optimal partitioning schemes closely related to the true one. Greedy algorithms identified the true partitioning scheme more frequently than the clustering algorithms, but selected slightly less accurate partitioning schemes and tended to underestimate the number of partitions. PartitionTest was several times faster than PartitionFinder, with equal or better accuracy. Importantly, maximum likelihood phylogenetic inference was very robust to the partitioning scheme. Best-fit partitioning schemes resulted in optimal phylogenetic performance, without appreciable differences compared to the use of the true partitioning scheme. However, accurate trees were also obtained by a \\\"simple\\\" strategy consisting of assigning independent GTR+G models to each data block. On the contrary, leaving the data unpartitioned always diminished the quality of the trees inferred, to a greater or lesser extent depending on the simulated scenario. The analysis of empirical data confirmed these trends, although suggesting a stronger influence of the partitioning scheme. Overall, our results suggests that statistical partitioning, but also the a priori assignment of independent GTR+G models, maximize phylogenomic performance.",

    "abstract": "Errors segregating homologous chromosomes during meiosis result in the formation of aneuploid gametes and are the largest contributing factor to birth defects and spontaneous abortions in humans. Saccharomyces cerevisiae has long served as a model organism for studying the gene network supporting normal chromosome segregation. Current methods of measuring homolog nondisjunction frequencies are laborious and involve dissecting thousands of tetrads to detect missegregation of individually marked chromosomes. Here we describe a holistic computational approach to determine the relative contributions of meiosis I nondisjunction and random spore death in mutants with reduced spore viability. These values are based on best-fit distributions of 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0 viable-spore tetrads to observed distributions in mutant and wild-type strains. We show proof-of-principle using published data sets that the calculated average meiosis I nondisjunction frequency closely matches empirically determined values. This analysis also points to meiosis I nondisjunction as an intrinsic component of spore inviability in wild-type strains. We uncover two classes of mutants that show distinct relationships between nondisjunction death and random spore death. Class I mutants, including those with known defects in establishing and maintaining the physical engagement of homologous chromosomes display a 4-fold greater ratio of nondisjunction death to random spore death compared to Class II mutants, which include those with defects in sister chromatid cohesion. Low numbers of required tetrads facilitates epistasis analysis to probe genetic interactions. Finally the application of the R-Scripts does not require any special strain construction and can be applied to previously observed tetrad distributions.",

    "abstract": "Legumes interact with rhizobium convert N2 into ammonia for plant use. To investigate the plant basal nitrogen fixation mechanisms induced in response to Bradyrhizobium, differential gene expression in root of inoculated and mock-inoculated soybean was analysed by RNA-Seq. A total of 55787 transcripts were aligned to soybean genome reference sequences, 280 and 316 transcripts were found to be up-and down-regulated, respectively, in inoculated relative to mock-inoculated soybeans root at V1 stage. Gene ontology (GO) analyses detected 104, 182 and 178 genes associated with cell component category, molecular function category and biological process category, respectively. Pathway analysis revealed that 98 differentiallly expressed genes (115 transcripts) involved in 169 biological pathways. We selected 19 differentially expressed genes and analyzed their expressions in mock-inoculated, inoculated USDA110 and CCBAU45436 using qRT-PCR. The results were consistent with those obtained from rhizobia infected RNA-Seq data. These showed that the results of RNA-Seq have reliability and universality. Additionally, this study showed some novel genes associated with nitrogen fixation process comparison with the previously identified QTLs.",
