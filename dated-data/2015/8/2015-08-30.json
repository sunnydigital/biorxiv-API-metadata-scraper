    "abstract": "The relatively recent development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques has revealed a wealth of novel sequences found in very low abundance: the rare biosphere. Today, most studies of diversity of microorganisms are carried out almost exclusively with HTS techniques. However, culturing seems indispensable for diversity studies especially if the aim is exploring the rare biosphere. We have carried out a deep (1 million sequences per sample) pyrosequencing analysis of two marine bacterial samples and isolated a culture collection from one of them. We have shown that the collectors curves of the pyrosequencing data were close to reaching an asymptote. We have estimated the total richness of the samples and the sequencing effort necessary to obtain the total estimated richness experimentally. Comparing the pyrosequencing data and the isolates sequences we have found that isolation retrieves some of the rarest taxa and that the composition of rare taxa follows an annual succession. We have shown that increasing the number of tags sequenced would slowly uncover the isolated bacteria. However, even if the whole bacterial diversity was found by increasing the sampling depth, culturing would still be essential for the study of marine bacterial communities, especially if the target is the rare biosphere.",

    "abstract": "O_LIRapid environmental change has generated growing interest in forecasts of future popu lation trajectories. Traditional population models built with detailed demographic obser vations from one study site can address the impacts of environmental change at particular locations, but are difficult to scale up to the landscape and regional scales relevant to man agement decisions. An alternative is to build models using population-level data that are much easier to collect over broad spatial scales than individual-level data. However, it is unknown whether models built using population-level data adequately capture the effects of density-dependence and environmental forcing that are necessary to generate skillful forecasts.\\nC_LIO_LIHere, we test the consequences of aggregating individual 29 responses when forecasting the population states (percent cover) and trajectories of four perennial grass species in a semi-arid grassland in Montana, USA. We parameterized two population models for each species, one based on individual-level data (survival, growth and recruitment) and one on population-level data (percent cover), and compared their forecasting accuracy and fore cast horizons with and without the inclusion of climate covariates. For both models, we used Bayesian ridge regression to weight the influence of climate covariates for optimal prediction.\\nC_LIO_LIIn the absence of climate effects, we found no significant difference between the forecast accuracy of models based on individual-level data and models based on population-level data. Climate effects were weak, but increased forecast accuracy for two species. Increases in accuracy with climate covariates were similar between model types.\\nC_LIO_LIIn our case study, percent cover models generated forecasts as accurate as those from a demographic model. For the goal of forecasting, models based on aggregated individual level data may offer a practical alternative to data-intensive demographic models. Long time series of percent cover data already exist for many plant species. Modelers should exploit these data to predict the impacts of environmental change.\\nC_LI",
