    "abstract": "The malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum has a great capacity for evolutionary adaptation to evade host immunity and develop drug resistance. Current understanding of parasite evolution is impeded by the fact that a large fraction of the genome is either highly repetitive or highly variable, and thus difficult to analyse using short read technologies. Here we describe a resource of deep sequencing data on parents and progeny from genetic crosses, which has enabled us to perform the first genome-wide, integrated analysis of SNP, INDEL and complex polymorphisms, using Mendelian error rates as an indicator of genotypic accuracy. These data reveal that INDELs are exceptionally abundant, being more common than SNPs and thus the dominant mode of polymorphism within the core genome. We use the high density of SNP and INDEL markers to analyse patterns of meiotic recombination, confirming a high rate of crossover events, and providing the first estimates for the rate of non-crossover events and the length of conversion tracts. We observe several instances of recombination that modify copy number variants associated with drug resistance, demonstrating a mechanism whereby fitness costs associated with resistance mutations could be compensated and greater phenotypic plasticity could be acquired. We describe a novel web application that allows these data to be explored in detail.",

    "abstract": "A digital approach to protein identification and quantity estimation using electrical measurements and database search is proposed. It is based on an electrolytic cell with two (three) nanopores and one (two) peptidase(s) covalently attached to the trans side of a pore. An unknown protein is digested by a reagent or peptidase into peptides ending in a known amino acid; the peptides enter the cell, pass through the first pore, and are fragmented by a high-specificity endopeptidase. The second enzyme, if present, is an exopeptidase that cleaves the fragments into single residues after the second pore. Level transitions in an ionic blockade or transverse current pulse due to residues in a fragment or individual pulses due to single residues are counted. This yields the positions of the endopeptidases target in the peptide, and, together with the peptides terminal residue, a partial sequence. Search through the Uniprot database for such sequences identifies over 90% of the proteins in the human proteome. The percentage can be increased by repeating the procedure with other reagents and cells specific to other residues, close to 100% may be possible. Sample purification to homogeneity is not required as the method applies to an arbitrary mixture of proteins; the quantity of a protein in the sample is estimated from the number of identifying peptides sensed over a long run. A Fokker-Planck model gives minimum enzyme turnover intervals required for ordered sensing of peptide fragments. With thick (80-100 nm) pores, required pulse resolution times are within the capability of CMOS detectors. The method can be implemented with existing technology; several related issues are discussed.",

    "abstract": "With the great advances in ancient DNA extraction, population genetics data are now made of geographically separated individuals from both present and ancient times. However, population genetics theory about the joint effect of space and time has not been thoroughly studied. Based on the classical stepping-stone model, we develop the theory of Isolation by Distance and Time. We derive the correlation of allele frequencies between demes in the case where ancient samples are present in the data, and investigate the impact of edge effects with forward-in-time simulations. We also derive results about coalescent times in circular/toroidal models. As one of the most common way to investigate population structure is to apply principal component analysis, we evaluate the impact of this theory on plots of principal components. Our results demonstrate that time between samples is a non-negligible factor that requires new attention in population genetics.",

    "abstract": "The X chromosome, with its unique mode of inheritance, contributes to differences between the sexes at a molecular level, including sex-specific gene expression and sex-specific impact of genetic variation. We have conducted an analysis of the impact of both sex and the X chromosome on patterns of gene expression identified through transcriptome sequencing of whole blood from 922 individuals. We identified that genes on the X chromosome are more likely to have sex-specific expression compared to the autosomal genes. Furthermore, we identified a depletion of regulatory variants on the X chromosome, especially among genes under high selective constraint. In contrast, we discovered an enrichment of sex-specific regulatory variants on the X chromosome. To resolve the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we generated and connected sex-specific chromatin accessibility to sex-specific expression and regulatory variation. As sex-specific regulatory variants can inform sex differences in genetic disease prevalence, we have integrated our data with genome-wide association study data for multiple immune traits and to identify traits with significant sex biases. Together, our study provides genome-wide insight into how the X chromosome and sex shape human gene regulation and disease.",

    "abstract": "In the early days of HIV treatment, drug resistance occurred rapidly and predictably in all patients, but under modern treatments, resistance arises slowly, if at all. The probability of resistance should be controlled by the rate of generation of resistant mutations. If many adaptive mutations arise simultaneously, then adaptation proceeds by soft selective sweeps in which multiple adaptive mutations spread concomitantly, but if adaptive mutations occur rarely in the population, then a single adaptive mutation should spread alone in a hard selective sweep. Here we use 6,717 HIV-1 consensus sequences from patients treated with first-line therapies between 1989 and 2013 to confirm that the transition from fast to slow evolution of drug resistance was indeed accompanied with the expected transition from soft to hard selective sweeps. This suggests more generally that evolution proceeds via hard sweeps if resistance is unlikely and via soft sweeps if it is likely.",

    "abstract": "Despite considerable efforts, known genetic associations only explain a small fraction of predicted heritability. Regional associations combine information from multiple contiguous genetic variants and can improve variance explained at established association loci. However, regional associations are not easily amenable to estimation using summary association statistics because of sensitivity to linkage disequilibrium (LD). We now propose a novel method to estimate phenotypic variance explained by regional associations using summary statistics while accounting for LD. Our method is asymptotically equivalent to multiple regression models when no interaction or haplotype effects are present. It has multiple applications, such as ranking of genetic regions according to variance explained or comparison of variance explained by to or more regions. Using height and BMI data from the Health Retirement Study (N=7,776), we show that most genetic variance lies in a small proportion of the genome and that previously identified linkage peaks have higher than expected regional variance.",

    "abstract": "The tympanic ring, malleus and incus of the mammalian middle ear derive from the ancestral primary jaw joint of land vertebrates. In Mesozoic mammals, evolutionary detachment of the mammalian middle ear from the lower jaw occurred when Meckels cartilage - the last connection between the middle ear bones and the dentary - disappeared. This disappearance is famously recapitulated in early mammalian development. By extension, it was suggested that other developmental processes also recapitulate specific evolutionary processes that led to mammalian middle ear detachment in Mesozoic mammals. Specifically, developmental posterior/medial displacement and negative allometry of the growing ear ossicles relative to the lower jaw are thought to reflect evolutionary triggers of mammalian middle ear detachment. However, these hypotheses rest on scant developmental data, and have not been tested in a quantitative framework. Here we show, based on CT scans of developmental series of several marsupials and monotremes, that negative allometry of mammalian middle ear bones relative to the skull occurs only after mammalian middle ear detachment, ruling it out as a developmental detachment trigger. There is also no positional change of ectotympanic or malleus relative to the dentary. The mammalian middle ear bones are differently positioned in two monotreme species, a recent change which is not developmentally recapitulated. Together, our results challenge the developmental prerequisites of previously proposed evolutionary detachment processes, arguing specifically against causal links between mammalian middle ear detachment and brain expansion. Our data are more consistent with a biomechanical detachment trigger relating to the onset of dentary function, but more biomechanical work and palaeontological data are required to test this notion.",
