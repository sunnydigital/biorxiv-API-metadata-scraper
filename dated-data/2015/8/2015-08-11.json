    "abstract": "Epistasis has long been thought to contribute to the genetic aetiology of complex diseases, yet few robust epistatic interactions in humans have been detected. We have conducted exhaustive genome-wide scans for pairwise epistasis in five independent celiac disease (CD) case-control studies, using a rapid model-free approach to examine over 500 billion SNP pairs in total. We found 20 significant epistatic signals within the HLA region which achieved stringent replication criteria across multiple studies and were independent of known CD risk HLA haplotypes. The strongest independent CD epistatic signal corresponded to genes in the HLA class III region, in particular PRRC2A and GPANK1/C6orf47, which are known to contain variants for non-Hodgkins lymphoma and early menopause, co-morbidities of celiac disease. Replicable evidence for epistatic variants outside the MHC was not observed. Both within and between European populations, we observed striking consistency of epistatic models and epistatic model distribution. Within the UK population, models of CD based on both epistatic and additive single-SNP effects increased explained CD variance by approximately 1% over those of single SNPs. Models of only epistatic pairs or additive single-SNPs showed similar levels of CD variance explained, indicating the existence of a substantial overlap of additive and epistatic components. Our findings have implications for the determination of genetic architecture and, by extension, the use of human genetics for validation of therapeutic targets.",

    "abstract": "Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the chemical energy currency of biology, is synthesized in eukaryotic cells primarily by the mitochondrial ATP synthase. ATP synthases operate by a rotary catalytic mechanism where proton translocation through the membrane-inserted Fo region is coupled to ATP synthesis in the catalytic F1 region via rotation of a central rotor subcomplex. We report here single particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) analysis of the bovine mitochondrial ATP synthase. Combining cryo-EM data with bioinformatic analysis allowed us to determine the fold of the a subunit, suggesting a proton translocation path through the Fo region that involves both the a and b subunits. 3D classification of images revealed seven distinct states of the enzyme that show different modes of bending and twisting in the intact ATP synthase. Rotational fluctuations of the c8-ring within the Fo region support a Brownian ratchet mechanism for proton-translocation driven rotation in ATP synthases.",

    "abstract": "Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are widely used, isolated from a variety of tissues and increasingly adopted for cell therapy, but the identity of these cells is poorly defined and commonalities between MSC from different tissues sources is controversial. Here we undertook a comprehensive review of all public MSC expression studies to assess whether cells derived from different sources shared any common molecular attributes. In doing so, we discovered an over-arching transcriptional phenotype shared by a wide variety of MSC, freshly isolated or cultured cells, and under a variety of growth conditions. We developed a modified variable selection protocol that included cross platform normalisation, and assessment of the selected gene stability and informativeness. A 16-gene signature classified MSC with >97% accuracy, discriminating these from fibroblasts, other adult stem/progenitor cell types and differentiated cells. The genes form part of a protein-interaction network, and mutations in more than 65% of this network were associated with Mendelian disorders of skeletal growth or metabolism. The signature and accompanying datasets are provided as a community resource at www.stemformatics.org resource, and the method is available from the CRAN repository.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSecond and third generation sequencing technologies have revolutionised bacterial genomics. Short-read Illumina reads result in cheap but fragmented assemblies, whereas longer reads are more expensive but result in more complete genomes. The Oxford Nanopore MinION device is a revolutionary mobile sequencer that can produce thousands of long, single molecule reads.\\n\\nResultsWe sequenced Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 using both the Illumina MiSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms. We were able to assemble a single chromosome of 5.18 Mb, with no gaps, using publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. We identified gene rearrangements and the state of invertible promoters in the strain.\\n\\nConclusionsThe single chromosome assembly of Bacteroides fragilis strain BE1 was achieved using only modest amounts of data, publicly available software and commodity computing hardware. This combination of technologies offers the possibility of ultra-cheap, high quality, finished bacterial genomes.",
