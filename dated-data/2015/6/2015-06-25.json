    "abstract": "We present a novel algorithm for the design of crossing experiments. The algorithm identifies a set of individuals (a \\\"crossing-set\\\") from a larger pool of potential crossing-sets by maximizing the diversity of traits of interest, for example, maximizing the range of genetic and geographic distances between individuals included in the crossing-set. To calculate diversity, we use the mean nearest neighbor distance of crosses plotted in trait space. We implement our algorithm on a real dataset of Neurospora crassa strains, using the genetic and geographic distances between potential crosses as a two-dimensional trait space. In simulated mating experiments, crossing-sets selected by our algorithm provide better estimates of underlying parameter values than randomly chosen crossing-sets.",

    "abstract": "Macrophages differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (IPSDMs) are a potentially valuable new tool for linking genotype to phenotype in functional studies. However, at a genome-wide level these cells have remained largely uncharacterised. Here, we compared the transcriptomes of naive and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and IPSDMs using RNA-Seq. The IPSDM and MDM transcriptomes were broadly similar and exhibited a highly conserved response to LPS. However, there were also significant differences in the expression of genes associated with antigen presentation and tissue remodelling. Furthermore, genes coding for multiple chemokines involved in neutrophil recruitment were more highly expressed in IPSDMs upon LPS stimulation. Additionally, analysing individual transcript expression identified hundreds of genes undergoing alternative promoter and 3' untranslated region usage following LPS treatment representing a previously under-appreciated level of regulation in the LPS response.",

    "abstract": "The advent of whole-genome sequencing has generated increased interest in modeling the structure of strain mixture within clinicial infections of Plasmodium falciparum (Pf). The life cycle of the parasite implies that the mixture of multiple strains within an infected individual is related to the out-crossing rate across populations, making methods for measuring this process in situ central to understanding the genetic epidemiology of the disease. In this paper, we show how to estimate inbreeding coefficients using genomic data from Pf clinical samples, providing a simple metric for assessing within-sample mixture that connects to an extensive literature in population genetics and conservation ecology. Features of the P. falciparum genome mean that some standard methods for inbreeding coefficients and related F-statistics cannot be used directly. Here, we review an initial effort to estimate the inbreeding coefficient within clinical isolates of P. falciparum and provide several generalizations using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches. The Bayesian approach connects these estimates to the Balding-Nichols model, a mainstay within genetic epidemiology. We provide simulation results on the performance of the estimators and show their use on ~ 1500 samples from the PF3K data set. We also compare the results to output from a recent mixture model for within-sample strain mixture, showing that inbreeding coefficients provide a strong proxy for the results of these more complex models. We provide the methods described within an open-source R package pfmix.",

    "abstract": "Models of the evolution of collective action typically assume that interactions occur in groups of identical size. In contrast, social interactions between animals occur in groups of widely dispersed size. This article models collective action problems as two-strategy multiplayer games and studies the effect of variability in group size on the evolution of cooperative behavior under the replicator dynamics. The analysis identifies elementary conditions on the payoff structure of the game implying that the evolution of cooperative behavior is promoted or inhibited when the group size experienced by a focal player is more or less variable. Similar but more stringent conditions are applicable when the confounding effect of size-biased sampling, which causes the group-size distribution experienced by a focal player to differ from the statistical distribution of group sizes, is taken into account.",

    "abstract": "Epistasis plays a significant role in the genetic architecture of many complex phenotypes in model organisms. To date, there have been very few interactions replicated in human studies due in part to the multiple hypothesis burden implicit in genome-wide tests of epistasis. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to develop the most powerful tests possible for detecting interactions. In this work we develop a new gene-gene interaction test for use in trio studies called the trio correlation (TC) test. The TC test computes the expected joint distribution of marker pairs in offspring conditional on parental genotypes. This distribution is then incorporated into a standard one degree of freedom correlation test of interaction. We show via extensive simulations that our test substantially outperforms existing tests of interaction in trio studies. The gain in power under standard models of phenotype is large, with previous tests requiring more than twice the number of trios to obtain the power of our test. We also demonstrate a bias in a previous trio interaction test and identify its origin. We conclude that the TC test shows improved power to identify interactions in existing, as well as emerging, trio association studies. The method is publicly available at www.github.com/BrunildaBalliu/TrioEpi.",

    "abstract": "Detection of genomic variants is commonly conducted by aligning a set of reads sequenced from an individual to the reference genome of the species and analyzing the resulting read pileup. Typically, this process finds a subset of variants already reported in databases and additional novel variants characteristic to the sequenced individual. Most of the effort in the literature has been put to the alignment problem on a single reference sequence, although our gathered knowledge on species such as human is pan-genomic: We know most of the common variation in addition to the reference sequence. There have been some efforts to exploit pan-genome indexing, where the most widely adopted approach is to build an index structure on a set of reference sequences containing observed variation combinations.\\n\\nThe enhancement in alignment accuracy when using pan-genome indexing has been demonstrated in experiments, but so far the above multiple references pan-genome indexing approach has not been tested on its final goal, that is, in enhancing variation detection. This is the focus of this article: We study a generic approach to add variation detection support on top of the multiple references pan-genomic indexing approach. Namely, we study the read pileup on a multiple alignment of reference genomes, and propose a heaviest path algorithm to extract a new recombined reference sequence. This recombined reference sequence can then be utilized in any standard read alignment and variation detection workflow. We demonstrate that the approach enhances variation detection on realistic data sets.",
