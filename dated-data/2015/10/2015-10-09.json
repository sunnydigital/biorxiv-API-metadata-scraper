    "abstract": "Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public health emergency. Increasingly drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) continue to emerge and spread, highlighting adaptability of this pathogen. Most studies of M.tb evolution have relied on  between-host samples, in which each person with TB is represented by a single M.tb isolate. However, individuals with TB commonly harbor populations of M.tb numbering in the billions. Here, we use analyses of M.tb genomic data from within and between hosts to gain insight into influences shaping genetic diversity of this pathogen. We find that the amount of M.tb genetic diversity harbored by individuals with TB can vary dramatically, likely as a function of disease severity. Surprisingly, we did not find an appreciable impact of TB treatment on M.tb diversity. In examining genomic data from M.tb samples within and between hosts with TB, we find that genes involved in the regulation, synthesis, and transportation of immunomodulatory cell envelope lipids appear repeatedly in the extremes of various statistical measures of diversity. Many of these genes have been identified as possible targets of selection in other studies employing different methods and data sets. Taken together, these observations suggest that M.tb cell envelope lipids are targets of selection within hosts. Many of these lipids are specific to pathogenic mycobacteria and, in some cases, human-pathogenic mycobacteria. We speculate that rapid adaptation of cell envelope lipids is facilitated by functional redundancy, flexibility in their metabolism, and their roles mediating interactions with the host.",

    "abstract": "The amount of nanoparticles (NPs) in human environment is increasing. The main sources are the increased introduction in consumer products and air pollution (diesel exhaust). It is meanwhile common knowledge that NPs behave differently as bulk material because of their nano-size. This leads in general to a higher reactivity and some other changed properties, e.g. solubility, surface potential, conductivity, and, to different effects on biological systems. The main impacts of NPs on a cellular and organism level are meanwhile well known: release of toxic ions, increased oxidative stress, and inflammation. Beside these, there is increasing evidence that NPs, especially in low dose/long exposure scenarios, affect biological systems in a broader way, interact with drugs, and exacerbate the effects of diseases. To investigate these effects systems biology approaches are the method of choice. This review summarizes the state of the art of nanoparticle effects on cells and organisms and demonstrate the add value of systems biology investigations to NP hazard assessment.\\n\\nAbbreviations: nanoparticle (NP), carbon nanotube (CNT), single walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT), multi walled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), ADME (adsorption, distribution, metabolization, excretion), PAMAM (poly(amidoamine)),",

    "abstract": "Background. Large mega base-pair genomic regions show robust alterations in DNA methylation levels in multiple cancers, a vast majority of which are hypo-methylated in cancers. These regions are generally bounded by CpG islands, overlap with Lamin Associated Domains and Large organized chromatin lysine modifications, and are associated with stochastic variability in gene expression. Given the size and consistency of hypo-methylated blocks (HMB) across cancer types, their immediate causes are likely to be encoded in the genomic region near HMB boundaries, in terms of specific genomic or epigenomic signatures. However, a detailed characterization of the HMB boundaries has not been reported.\\n\\nMethod. Here, we focused on ~13k HMBs, encompassing approximately half the genome, identified in colon cancer. We analyzed a number of distinguishing features at the HMB boundaries including transcription factor (TF) binding motifs, various epigenomic marks, and chromatin structural features.\\n\\nResult. We found that the classical promoter epigenomic mark - H3K4me3, is highly enriched at HMB boundaries, as are CTCF bound sites. HMB boundaries harbor distinct combinations of TF motifs. Our Random Forest model based on TF motifs can accurately distinguish boundaries not only from regions inside and outside HMBs, but surprisingly, from active promoters as well. Interestingly, the distinguishing TFs and their interacting proteins are involved in chromatin modification. Finally, HMB boundaries significantly coincide with the boundaries of Topologically Associating Domains of the chromatin.\\n\\nConclusion. Our analyses suggest that the overall architecture of HMBs is guided by pre-existing chromatin architecture, and are associated with aberrant activity of promoter-like sequences at the boundary.",

    "abstract": "Phenotypic plasticity is an evolutionary driving force in diverse biological processes, including the adaptive immune system, the development of neoplasms, and the bacterial acquisition of drug resistance. It is essential, therefore, to understand the evolutionary advantage of an allele that confers cells the ability to express a range of phenotypes. Of particular importance is to understand how this advantage of phenotypic plasticity depends on the degree of heritability of non-genetically encoded phenotypes between generations, which can induce irreversible evolutionary changes in the population. Here, we study the fate of a new mutation that allows the expression of multiple phenotypic states, introduced into a finite population otherwise composed of individuals who can express only a single phenotype. We analyze the fixation probability of such an allele as a function of the strength of inter-generational phenotypic heritability, called memory, the variance of expressible phenotypes, the rate of environmental changes, and the population size. We find that the fate of a phenotypically plastic allele depends fundamentally on the environmental regime. In a constant environment, the fixation probability of a plastic allele always increases with the degree of phenotypic memory. In periodically fluctuating environments, by contrast, there is an optimum phenotypic memory that maximizes the probability of the plastic alleles fixation. This same optimum value of phenotypic memory also maximizes geometric mean fitness, in steady state. We interpret these results in the context of previous studies in an infinite-population framework. We also discuss the implications of our results for the design of therapies that can overcome resistance, in a variety of diseases.",

    "abstract": "Complex gene expression patterns are mediated by binding of transcription factors (TF) to specific genomic loci. The in vivo occupancy of a TF is, in large part, determined by the TFs DNA binding interaction partners, motivating genomic context based models of TF occupancy. However, the approaches thus far have assumed a uniform binding model to explain genome wide bound sites for a TF in a cell-type and as such heterogeneity of TF occupancy models, and the extent to which binding rules underlying a TFs occupancy are shared across cell types, has not been investigated. Here, we develop an ensemble based approach (TRISECT) to identify heterogeneous binding rules of cell-type specific TF occupancy and analyze the inter-cell-type sharing of such rules. Comprehensive analysis of 23 TFs, each with ChIP-Seq data in 4-12 cell-types, shows that by explicitly capturing the heterogeneity of binding rules, TRISECT accurately identifies in vivo TF occupancy (93%) substantially improving upon previous methods. Importantly, many of the binding rules derived from individual cell-types are shared across cell-types and reveal distinct yet functionally coherent putative target genes in different cell-types. Closer inspection of the predicted cell-type-specific interaction partners provides insights into context-specific functional landscape of a TF. Together, our novel ensemble-based approach reveals, for the first time, a widespread heterogeneity of binding rules, comprising interaction partners within a cell-type, many of which nevertheless transcend cell-types. Notably, the putative targets of shared binding rules in different cell-types, while distinct, exhibit significant functional coherence.",

    "abstract": "Many questions about human genetic history can be addressed by examining the patterns of shared genetic variation between sets of populations. A useful methodological framework for this purpose are F-statistics, that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three and four populations, and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. Here, we put these statistics in context of phylogenetic and population genetic theory. We show how measures of genetic drift can be interpreted as branch lengths, paths through an admixture graph or in terms of the internal branches in coalescent trees. We show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing us to generalize applications for arbitrary phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, we derive novel expressions for the F-statistics, which enables us to explore the behavior of F-statistic under population structure models. In particular, we show that population substructure may complicate inference.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryFor the analysis of genetic data from hundreds of populations, a commonly used technique are a set of simple statistics on data from two, three and four populations. These statistics are used to test hypotheses involving the history of populations, in particular whether data is consistent with the history of a set of populations forming a tree.\\n\\nHere, we provide context to these statistics by deriving novel expressions and by relating them to approaches in comparative phylogenetics. These results are useful because they provide a straightforward interpretation of these statistics under many demographic processes and lead to simplified expressions. However, the result also reveals the limitations of F-statistics, in that population substructure may complicate inference.",
