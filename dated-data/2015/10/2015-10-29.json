    "abstract": "The advent of high throughput RNA-seq at the single-cell level has opened up new opportunities to elucidate the heterogeneity of gene expression. One of the most widespread applications of RNA-seq is to identify genes which are differentially expressed between two experimental conditions. Here, we present a discrete, distributional method for differential gene expression (D3E), a novel algorithm specifically designed for single-cell RNA-seq data. We use synthetic data to evaluate D3E, demonstrating that it can detect changes in expression, even when the mean level remains unchanged. Since D3E is based on an analytically tractable stochastic model, it provides additional biological insights by quantifying biologically meaningful properties, such as the average burst size and frequency. We use D3E to investigate experimental data, and with the help of the underlying model, we directly test hypotheses about the driving mechanism behind changes in gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Starch synthesis requires several enzymatic activities including branching enzymes (BEs) responsible for the formation of (1[-&gt;]6) linkages. Distribution and number of these linkages are further controlled by debranching enzymes (DBEs) that cleave some of them, rendering the polyglucan water-insoluble and semi-crystalline. Although the activity of BEs and DBEs is mandatory to sustain normal starch synthesis, the relative importance of each in the establishment of the plant storage polyglucan (i.e. water-insolubility, crystallinity, presence of amylose) is still debated. Here, we have substituted the activity of BEs in Arabidopsis with that of the Escherichia coli glycogen branching enzyme (GlgB). The latter is the BE counterpart in the metabolism of glycogen, a highly branched water-soluble and amorphous storage polyglucan. GlgB was expressed in the be2 be3 double mutant of Arabidopsis that is devoid of BE activity and consequently free of starch. The synthesis of a water-insoluble, partly crystalline, amylose-containing starch-like polyglucan was restored in GlgB-expressing plants, suggesting that BEs origin only have a limited impact on establishing essential characteristics of starch. Moreover, the balance between branching and debranching is crucial for the synthesis of starch, as an excess of branching activity results in the formation of highly branched, water-soluble, poorly crystalline polyglucan.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium vivax is the most prevalent malarial species in South America and exerts a substantial burden on the populations it affects. The control and eventual elimination of P. vivax are global health priorities. Genomic research contributes to this objective by improving our understanding of the biology of P. vivax and through the development of new genetic markers that can be used to monitor efforts to reduce malaria transmission.\\n\\nHere we analyze whole-genome data from eight field samples from a region in Cordoba, Colombia where malaria is endemic. We find considerable genetic diversity within this population, a result that contrasts with earlier studies suggesting that P. vivax had limited diversity in the Americas. We also identify a selective sweep around a substitution known to confer resistance to sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). This is the first observation of a selective sweep for SP resistance in this species. These results indicate that P. vivax has been exposed to SP pressure even when the drug is not in use as a first line treatment for patients afflicted by this parasite. We identify multiple non-synonymous substitutions in three other genes known to be involved with drug resistance in Plasmodium species. Finally, we found extensive microsatellite polymorphisms. Using this information we developed 18 polymorphic and easy to score microsatellite loci that can be used in epidemiological investigations in South America.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAlthough P. vivax is not as deadly as the more widely studied P. falciparum, it remains a pressing global health problem. Here we report the results of a whole-genome study of P. vivax from Cordoba, Colombia, in South America. This parasite is the most prevalent in this region. We show that the parasite population is genetically diverse, which is contrary to expectations from earlier studies from the Americas. We also find molecular evidence that resistance to an anti-malarial drug has arisen recently in this region. This selective sweep indicates that the parasite has been exposed to a drug that is not used as first-line treatment for this malaria parasite. In addition to extensive single nucleotide and microsatellite polymorphism, we report 18 new genetic loci that might be helpful for fine-scale studies of this species in the Americas.",

    "abstract": "Data analysis tools have become essential to the study of biology. Here, we applied language workbench technology (LWT) to create data analysis languages tailored for biologists with a diverse range of experience: from beginners with no programming experience to expert bioinformaticians and statisticians. A key novelty of our approach is its ability to blend user interface with scripting in a single platform. This feature helps beginners and experts alike analyze data more productively. This new approach has several advantages over state of the art approaches currently popular for data analysis: experts can design simplified data analysis languages that require no programming experience, and behave like graphical user interfaces, yet have the advantages of scripting. We report on such a simple language, called MetaR, which we have used to teach complete beginners how to call differentially expressed genes and build heatmaps. We found that beginners can complete this task in less than 2 hours with MetaR, when more traditional teaching with R and its packages would require several training sessions (6-24hrs). Furthermore, MetaR seamlessly integrates with docker to enable reproducibility of analyses and simplified R package installations during training sessions. We used the same approach to develop the first composable R language. A composable language is a language that can be extended with micro-languages. We illustrate this capability with a Biomart micro-language designed to compose with R and help R programmers query Biomart interactively to assemble specific queries to retrieve data, (The same micro-language also composes with MetaR to help beginners query Biomart.) Our teaching experience suggests that language design with LWT can be a compelling approach for developing intelligent data analysis tools and can accelerate training for common data analysis task. LWT offers an interactive environment with the potential to promote exchanges between beginner and expert data analysts.",

    "abstract": "Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) are required for the development and differentiation of T cells and are sufficient for the positive and negative selection of developing T cells. Although TECs play a critical role in T cell biology, simple, efficient and readily scalable methods for the transfection of TEC lines and primary TECs have not been described. We tested the efficiency of Nucleofection for the transfection of 4 different mouse thymic epithelial cell lines that had been derived from cortical or medullary epithelium. We also tested primary mouse thymic epithelial cells isolated from fetal and postnatal stages. We found that Nucleofection was highly efficient for the transfection of thymic epithelial cells, with transfection efficiencies of 30-70% for the cell lines and 15-35% for primary TECs with low amounts of cell death. Efficient transfection by Nucleofection can be performed with established cortical and medullary thymic epithelial cell lines as well as primary TECs isolated from E15.5 day fetal thymus or postnatal day 3 or 30 thymus tissue. The high efficiency of Nucleofection for TEC transfection will enable the use of TEC lines in high throughput transfection studies and simplifies the transfection of primary TECs for in vitro or in vivo analysis.",

    "abstract": "The mitochondrial (mt) genome is present in many copies in human cells, and intra-individual variation in mtDNA sequences is known as heteroplasmy. Recent studies found that heteroplasmies are highly tissue-specific, site-specific, and allele-specific, however the functional implications have not been explored. This study investigates variation in mtDNA copy numbers (mtCN) in 12 different tissues obtained at autopsy from 152 individuals (ranging in age from 3 days to 96 years). Three different methods to estimate mtCN were compared: shotgun sequencing (in 4 tissues), capture-enriched sequencing (in 12 tissues) and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR, in 2 tissues). The highest precision in mtCN estimation was achieved using shotgun sequencing data. However, capture-enrichment data provide reliable estimates of relative (albeit not absolute) mtCNs. Comparisons of mtCN from different tissues of the same individual revealed that mtCNs in different tissues are, with few exceptions, uncorrelated. Hence, each tissue of an individual seems to regulate mtCN in a tissue-related rather than an individual-dependent manner. Skeletal muscle (SM) samples showed an age-related decrease in mtCN that was especially pronounced in males, while there was an age-related increase in mtCN for liver (LIV) samples. MtCN in SM samples was significantly negatively correlated with both the total number of heteroplasmic sites and with minor allele frequency (MAF) at two heteroplasmic sites, 408 and 16327. Heteroplasmies at both sites are highly specific for SM, accumulate with aging and are part of functional elements that regulate mtDNA replication. These data support the hypothesis that selection acting on these heteroplasmic sites is reducing mtCN in SM of older individuals.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryThe total number of mitochondrial genomes in a human cell differs between individuals and between the tissues of a single individual; however the factors that influence this variation remain unknown. We estimated mtDNA copy number (mtCN) in 12 different tissues of 152 individuals applying three different methods, and found age-related variation for two tissues: mtCN in skeletal muscle is negatively correlated with age (especially in males) while mtCN in liver is positively correlated with age. Overall, mtCNs of different tissues within an individual are mainly independent of each other, indicating that tissue-specific rather than individual-specific processes largely influence mtCN.\\n\\nHeteroplasmy refers to intra-individual differences in the sequence of the mtDNA genome and heteroplasmic mutations accumulate during aging. Linear and partial regression analyses of mtCN with heteroplasmy (determined in a previous study of these same samples) revealed that the decrease of mtCN in skeletal muscle is mainly correlated with an increasing total number of heteroplasmic sites, and with increasing minor allele frequency at two sites (408 and 16327), that are heteroplasmic almost exclusively in skeletal muscle. As both sites are part of functional elements required for regulation of mtDNA replication, we suggest that selection may be acting via increasing heteroplasmy to reduce mtCN during aging.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing interest in developing novel brain stimulation methods to control disease-related aberrant neural activity and to address basic neuroscience questions. Conventional methods for manipulating brain activity rely on open-loop approaches that usually lead to excessive stimulation and, crucially, do not restore the original computations performed by the network. Thus, they are often accompanied by undesired side-effects. Here, we introduce delayed feedback control (DFC), a conceptually simple but effective method, to control pathological oscillations in spiking neural networks. Using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations we show that DFC can restore a wide range of aberrant network dynamics either by suppressing or enhancing synchronous irregular activity. Importantly, DFC besides steering the system back to a healthy state, it also recovers the computations performed by the underlying network. Finally, using our theory we isolate the role of single neuron and synapse properties in determining the stability of the closed-loop system.",

    "abstract": "The Chlamydomonas genome has been sequenced, assembled and annotated to produce a rich resource for genetics and molecular biology in this well-studied model organism. However, the current reference genome contains ~1000 blocks of unknown sequence ( N-islands), which are frequently placed in introns of annotated gene models. We developed a strategy, using careful bioinformatics analysis of short-sequence cDNA and genomic DNA reads, to search for previously unknown exons hidden within such blocks, and determine the sequence and exon/intron boundaries of such exons. These methods are based on assembly and alignment completely independent of prior reference assembly or reference annotation. Our evidence indicates that ~one-quarter of the annotated intronic N-islands actually contain hidden exons. For most of these our algorithm recovers full exonic sequence with associated splice junctions and exon-adjacent intron sequence, that can be joined to the reference genome assembly and annotated transcript models. These new exons represent de novo sequence generally present nowhere in the assembled genome, and the added sequence can be shown in many cases to greatly improve evolutionary conservation of the predicted encoded peptides. At the same time, our results confirm the purely intronic status for a substantial majority of N-islands annotated as intronic in the reference annotated genome, increasing confidence in this valuable resource.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene expression is known to be an intrinsically stochastic process which can involve single-digit numbers of mRNA molecules in a cell at any given time. The modelling of such processes calls for the use of exact stochastic simulation methods, most notably the Gillespie algorithm. However, this stochasticity, also termed \\\"intrinsic noise\\\", does not account for all the variability between genetically identical cells growing in a homogeneous environment. Despite substantial experimental efforts, determining appropriate model parameters continues to be a challenge. Methods based on approximate Bayesian computation can be used to obtain posterior parameter distributions given the observed data. However, such inference procedures require large numbers of simulations of the model and exact stochastic simulation is computationally costly. In this work we focus on the specific case of trying to infer model parameters describing reaction rates and extrinsic noise on the basis of measurements of molecule numbers in individual cells at a given time point.\\n\\nResultsTo make the problem computationally tractable we develop an exact, model-specific, stochastic simulation algorithm for the commonly used two-state model of gene expression. This algorithm relies on certain assumptions and favourable properties of the model to forgo the simulation of the whole temporal trajectory of protein numbers in the system, instead returning only the number of protein and mRNA molecules present in the system at a specified time point. The computational gain is proportional to the number of protein molecules created in the system and becomes significant for systems involving hundreds or thousands of protein molecules. We employ this algorithm, approximate Bayesian computation, and published gene expression data for Escherichia coli to simultaneously infer the models rate parameters and parameters describing extrinsic noise for 86 genes.",
