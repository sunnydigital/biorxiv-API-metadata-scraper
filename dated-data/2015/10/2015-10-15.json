    "abstract": "AbstractA tutorial introduction to computational modeling of Wnt signaling pathway in a human colorectal cancer dataset using static Bayesian network models is provided. The walkthrough might aid bio-logists/informaticians in understanding the design of computational experiments that is interleaved with exposition of the Matlab code and causal models from Bayesian Network toolbox. This is done in order to ease the understanding of beginner students and researchers in transition to computational signaling biology, who intend to work in the field of modeling of signaling pathways. The manuscript expounds the computational flow of the contents in advance article1 via code development and takes the reader in a step by step process of how * the collection and the transformation of the available biological information from literature is done, * the integration of the heterogeneous data and prior biological knowledge in the network is achieved, * conditional probability tables for nodes in biologically inspired tables are estimated, * the simulation study is designed, * the hypothesis regarding a biological phenomena is transformed into computational framework, and * results and inferences drawn using d-connectivity/separability are reported. The manuscript finally ends with a programming assignment to help the readers get hands on experience of a perturbation project. Matlab code with dataset is made available under GNU GPL v3 license at google code project on https://code.google.com/p/static-bn-for-wnt-signaling-pathway\\n\\nInsight, Innovation and IntegrationSimulation study involving computational experiments dealing with Wnt signaling pathways abound in literature but often lack a pedagogical perspective that might ease the understanding of beginner students and researchers in transition who intend to work on modeling of the pathway. This paucity might happen due to restrictive policies which enforce an unwanted embargo on the sharing of important scientific knowledge. The manuscript elucidates embedding of prior biological knowledge, integration of heterogeneous information, transformation of biological hypothesis into computational framework and design of experiments in a simple manner interleaved with aspects of Bayesian Network toolbox and Matlab code so as to help readers get a feel of a project related to modeling of the pathway.",

    "abstract": "Drugs of abuse implicate both reward learning and homeostatic regulation mechanisms of the brain. Theories of addiction, thus, have mostly depicted this phenomenon as pathology in either habit-based learning system or homeostatic mechanisms. Showing the limits of those accounts, we hypothesize that compulsive drug seeking arises from drugs hijacking a system that integrates homeostatic regulation mechanism with goal-directed action/behavior. Building upon a recently developed homeostatic reinforcement learning theory, we present a computational theory proposing that cocaine reinforces goal-directed drug-seeking due to its rapid homeostatic corrective effect, whereas its chronic use induces slow and long-lasting changes in homeostatic setpoint. Our theory accounts for key behavioral and neurobiological features of addiction, most notably, escalation of cocaine use, drug-primed craving and relapse, and individual differences underlying susceptibility to addiction. The theory also generates unique predictions about the mechanisms of cocaine-intake regulation and about cocaine-primed craving and relapse that are confirmed by new experiments.\\n\\nSignificanceChronic use of addictive drugs renders increased motivation in planning to obtain and consume the drugs, despite their adverse social, occupational, and health consequences. It is as if addicts gradually develop a strong need for the drug and use their cognitive abilities and the knowledge of their environment in order to fulfil that need. In this paper, we build a mathematical model of this conception of addiction and show through quantitative simulations that such a model actually behaves in the same way that human addicts or laboratory animals that are exposed to cocaine behave. For example, the model shows gradually increasing motivation for drugs, relapse after long periods of abstinence, and individual differences in susceptibility to addiction.",

    "abstract": "Multiple experimental evolution studies on D. melanogaster in the 1980s and 1990s indicated that enhanced competitive ability evolved primarily through increased larval tolerance to nitrogenous wastes and increased larval feeding and foraging rate, at the cost of efficiency of food conversion to biomass, and this became the widely accepted view of how adaptation to larval crowding evolves in fruitflies. We recently showed that populations of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta subjected to extreme larval crowding evolved greater competitive ability without evolving higher feeding rates, primarily through a combination of reduced larval duration, faster attainment of minimum critical size for pupation, greater efficiency of food conversion to biomass, increased pupation height and, perhaps, greater urea/ammonia tolerance. This was a very different suite of traits than that seen to evolve under similar selection in D. melanogaster and was closer to the expectations from the theory of K-selection. At that time, we suggested two possible reasons for the differences in the phenotypic correlates of greater competitive ability seen in the studies with D. melanogaster and the other two species. First, that D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta had a very different genetic architecture of traits affecting competitive ability compared to the long-term, laboratory populations of D. melanogaster used in the earlier studies, either because the populations of the former two species were relatively recently wild-caught, or by virtue of being different species. Second, that the different evolutionary trajectories in D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta versus D. melanogaster were a reflection of differences in the manner in which larval crowding was imposed in the two sets of selection experiments. The D. melanogaster studies used a higher absolute density of eggs per unit volume of food, and a substantially larger total volume of food, than the studies on D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta. Here, we show that long-term laboratory populations of D. melanogaster, descended from some of the populations used in the earlier studies, evolve essentially the same set of traits as the D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta crowding-adapted populations when subjected to a similar larval density at low absolute volumes of food. As in the case of D. ananassae and D. n. nasuta, and in stark contrast to earlier studies with D. melanogaster, these crowding-adapted populations of D. melanogaster did not evolve greater larval feeding rates as a correlate of increased competitive ability. The present results clearly suggest that the suite of phenotypes through which the evolution of greater competitive ability is achieved in fruitflies depends critically not just on larval density per unit volume of food, but also on the total amount of food available in the culture vials. We discuss these results in the context of an hypothesis about how larval density and the height of the food column in culture vials might interact to alter the fitness costs and benefits of increased larval feeding rates, thus resulting in different routes to the evolution of greater competitive ability, depending on the details of exactly how the larval crowding was implemented.",

    "abstract": "Although single genes underlying several evolutionary adaptations have been identified, the genetic basis of complex, polygenic adaptations has been far more challenging to pinpoint. Here we report that the budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus has recently evolved resistance to citrinin, a naturally occurring mycotoxin. Applying a genome-wide test for selection on cis-regulation, we identified five genes involved in the citrinin response that are constitutively up-regulated in S. paradoxus. Four of these genes are necessary for resistance, and are also sufficient to increase the resistance of a sensitive strain when over-expressed. Moreover, cis-regulatory divergence in the promoters of these genes contributes to resistance, while exacting a cost in the absence of citrinin. Our results demonstrate how the subtle effects of individual regulatory elements can be combined, via natural selection, into a complex adaptation. Our approach can be applied to dissect the genetic basis of polygenic adaptations in a wide range of species.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryAdaptation via natural selection has been a subject of great interest for well over a century, yet we still have little understanding of its molecular basis. What are the genetic changes that are actually being selected? While single genes underlying several adaptations have been identified, the genetic basis of complex, polygenic adaptations has been far more challenging to pinpoint. The complex trait that we study here is the resistance of Saccharomyces yeast to a mycotoxin called citrinin, which is produced by many other species of fungi, and is a common food contaminant for both humans and livestock. We found that sequence changes in the promoters of at least three genes have contributed to citrinin resistance, by up-regulating their transcription even in the absence of citrinin. Higher expression of these genes confers a fitness advantage in the presence of citrinin, while exacting a cost in its absence-- a fitness tradeoff. Our results provide a detailed view of a complex adaptation, and our approach can be applied to polygenic adaptations in a wide range of species.",

Here, we present a substantially improved assembly of the Heliconius melpomene genome, developed using novel methods that should be applicable to improving other genome assemblies produced using short read sequencing. Firstly, we whole genome sequenced a pedigree to produce a linkage map incorporating 99% of the genome. Secondly, we incorporated haplotype scaffolds extensively to produce a more complete haploid version of the draft genome. Thirdly, we incorporated ~20x coverage of Pacific Biosciences sequencing and scaffolded the haploid genome using an assembly of this long read sequence. These improvements result in a genome of 795 scaffolds, 275 Mb in length, with an L50 of 2.1 Mb, an N50 of 34 and with 99% of the genome placed and 84% anchored on chromosomes. We use the new genome assembly to confirm that the Heliconius genome underwent 10 chromosome fusions since the split with its sister genus Eueides, over a period of about 6 million years.",

    "abstract": "Genetic studies of African-Americans identify functional variants, elucidate historical and genealogical mysteries, and reveal basic biology. However, African-Americans have been under-represented in genetic studies, and little is known about nation-wide patterns of genomic diversity in the population. Here, we present a comprehensive assessment of African-American genomic diversity using genotype data from nationally and regionally representative cohorts. We find higher African ancestry in southern United States compared to the North and West. We show that relatedness patterns track north- and west-bound routes followed during the Great Migration, suggesting that admixture occurred predominantly in the South prior to the Civil War and that ancestry-biased migration is responsible for regional differences in ancestry. Rare genetic traits among African-Americans can therefore be shared over long geographic distances along the Great Migration routes, yet their distribution over short distances remains highly structured. This study clarifies the role of recent demography in shaping African-American genomic diversity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWO_LIMatrix models or integral projection models (IPMs) are commonly used to study the dynamics of structured populations, where discrete or continuous traits influence survival, growth, or reproduction. When a populations size is small, as is often the case for threatened species or potentially invasive species arriving in novel habitats, extinction risk may be substantial due to demographic stochasticity.\\nC_LIO_LIBranching processes, which are individual-based counterparts to matrix models and IPMs, allow one to quantify these risks of extinction. For discretely structured populations, the theory of multi-type branching processes provides analytic methods to compute how extinction risk changes over time and how it depends on the size and composition of the population. Building on prior work on continuous-state branching processes, we extend these analytic methods to individual-based models accounting for any mixture of discrete and continuous population structure.\\nC_LIO_LIThe individual-based IPMs are defined by probabilistic update rules at the level of the individual which determine how each individual with a given trait value dies, changes trait value (e.g. grows in size), or produces individuals with the same or other trait values. Probabilities of extinction are shown to be analytically determined by probability generating functionals associated with the individual-based IPMs. In particular, we present analytical expressions for how extinction probabilities change over time and depend on the initial abundance and trait distribution of the population. We illustrate how to numerically implement these methods using data from the short-lived desert shrub species Cryptantha flava, and provide a more general discussion of how to implement these methods to other data sets including those involving fluctuating environmental conditions.\\nC_LIO_LIAs most IPM studies have the necessary data to parameterize individual-based IPMs, these methods provide a computationally efficient means to explore how continuously structured populations differing in their evolutionary history and environmental context may differ in their vulnerability to extinction or ability to colonize new habitats.\\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Existing methods for interpreting protein variation focus on annotating mutation pathogenicity rather than detailed interpretation of variant deleteriousness and frequently use only sequence-based or structure-based information. We present VIPUR, a computational framework that seamlessly integrates sequence analysis and structural modeling (using the Rosetta protein modeling suite) to identify and interpret deleterious protein variants. To train VIPUR, we collected 9,477 protein variants with known effects on protein function from multiple organisms and curated structural models for each variant from crystal structures and homology models. VIPUR can be applied to mutations in any organisms proteome with improved generalized accuracy (AUROC .83) and interpretability (AUPR .87) compared to other methods. We demonstrate that VIPUR s predictions of deleteriousness match the biological phenotypes in ClinVar and provide a clear ranking of prediction confidence. We use VIPUR to interpret known mutations associated with inflammation and diabetes, demonstrating the structural diversity of disrupted functional sites and improved interpretation of mutations associated with human diseases. Lastly we demonstrate VIPUR s ability to highlight candidate genes associated with human diseases by applying VIPUR to de novo variants associated with autism spectrum disorders.",
