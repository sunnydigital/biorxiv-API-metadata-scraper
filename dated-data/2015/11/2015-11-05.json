    "abstract": "Spatial aggregation or clustering of membrane proteins could be important for their functionality, e.g., in signaling, and nanoscale imaging can be used to study its origins, structure and function. Such studies require accurate characterization of clusters, both for absolute quantification and hypothesis testing. A set of model-free quantification approaches -- free of specific cluster models-- have been proposed for this purpose. They include the radius of maximal aggregation ra obtained from the maxima of the empirical Besag L(r) - r function as an estimator of cluster size, and the estimation of various cluster parameters based on an exponential approximation for the Pair Correlation Function(PCF). However, the parameter identifiability and bias and scaling due to their model-free nature are not clear. In practice, the clusters might exhibit specific patterns, and the behavior of these estimators in such cases must be studied. Here, we theoretically analyze these approaches for a set of cluster models, and obtain information about their identifiability and bias. We find that the ratio between ra and true cluster size depends on both the true size as well as the number of clusters per unit area, or other corresponding parameters, in a model-dependent manner. In particular, ra scales with respect to the true size by a factor that can be arbitrarily large, depending on models and parameter values. For the method based on PCF approximation, for most models we analyzed, the ratios between approximate and true model parameters were found to be constants that depend only on models and independent of other parameters. For the models analyzed, this ratio was within {+/-}100%. Our theoretical approach was validated by means of simulations. We also discuss some general issues in inference using second-order spatial properties. While precision could also be key, such information on identifiability and accuracy provides clarity on estimation, can lead to better inference, and can also fuel more accurate method development.",

    "abstract": "Spike patterns are among the most common electrophysiological descriptors of neuron types. Surprisingly, it is not clear how the diversity in firing patterns of the neurons in a network affects its activity dynamics. Here, we introduce the state-dependent stochastic bursting neuron model allowing for a change in its firing patterns independent of changes in its input-output firing rate relationship. Using this model, we show that the effect of single neuron spiking on the network dynamics is contingent on the network activity state. While spike bursting can both generate and disrupt oscillations, these patterns are ineffective in large regions of the network state space in changing the network activity qualitatively. Finally, we show that when single-neuron properties are made dependent on the population activity, a hysteresis like dynamics emerges. This novel phenomenon has important implications for determining the network response to time-varying inputs and for the network sensitivity at different operating points.",

    "abstract": "Metagenome shotgun sequence projects offer the potential for large scale biogeographic analysis of microbial species. In this project we developed a method for detecting 33 common subtypes of the pathogenic bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. We used a binomial mixture model implemented in the binstrain software and the coverage counts at > 100,000 known S. aureus SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) sites derived from prior comparative genomic analysis to estimate the proportion of each subtype in metagenome samples. Using this pipeline we were able to obtain > 87% sensitivity and > 94% specificity when testing on low genome coverage samples of diverse S. aureus strains (0.025X). We found that 321 and 149 metagenome samples from the Human Microbiome Project and metaSUB analysis of the New York City subway, respectively, contained S. aureus at genome coverage > 0.025. In both projects, CC8 and CC30 were the most common S. aureus subtypes encountered. We found evidence that the subtype composition at different body sites of the same individual were more similar than random sampling and more limited evidence that certain body sites were enriched for particular subtypes. One surprising finding was the apparent high frequency of CC398, a lineage associated with livestock, in samples from the tongue dorsum. Epidemiologic analysis of the HMP subject population suggested that high BMI (body mass index) and health insurance are risk factors for S. aureus but there was limited power to find factors linked to carriage of even the most common subtype. In the NYC subway data, we found a small signal of geographic distance affecting subtype clustering but other unknown factors influence taxonomic distribution of the species around the city. We argue that pathogen detection in metagenome samples requires the use of subtypes based on whole species population genomic analysis rather than using ad hoc collections of reference strains.",

    "abstract": "The growth in genome-scale assays of gene expression for different species in publicly available databases presents new opportunities for computational methods that aid in hypothesis generation and biological interpretation of these data. Here, we present an unsupervised machine-learning approach, ADAGE (Analysis using Denoising Autoencoders of Gene Expression) and apply it to the interpretation of all of the publicly available gene expression data for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen. In post-hoc positive control analyses using curated knowledge, the P. aeruginosa ADAGE model found that co-operonic genes often participated in similar processes and accurately predicted which genes had similar functions. By analyzing newly generated data and previously published microarray and RNA-seq data, the ADAGE model identified gene expression differences between strains, modeled the cellular response to low oxygen, and predicted the involvement of biological processes despite low level expression differences in directly involved genes. Comparison of ADAGE with PCA and ICA revealed that ADAGE extracts distinct signals. We provide the ADAGE model with analysis of all publicly available P. aeruginosa GeneChip experiments, and we provide open source code for use in other species and settings.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock is a fundamental feature of gene regulation and cell physiology in eukaryotes and some prokaryotes, and an exemplar gene regulatory network in Systems Biology. The circadian system in Arabidopsis thaliana is complex in part due to its photo-transduction pathways. Analysis of natural genetic variation between Arabidopsis accessions Cape Verde Islands (Cvi-0) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) identified a major, temperature-specific Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) on chromosome V that altered the circadian period of leaf movement (Edwards et al., Genetics, 2005). We tested Near-Isogenic Lines (NILs) to confirm that Ler alleles at this PerCv5c QTL lengthened the circadian period at 12{degrees}C, with little effect at higher temperatures. The PHYTOCHROME C gene lies within the QTL interval, and contains multiple sequence variants. Plants carrying either a T-DNA-insertion into PHYC or a deletion of PHYC also lengthened circadian period under white light, except at 27{degrees}C. phyB and phyABE mutants lengthened period only at 12{degrees}C. These results extend recent data showing PhyC effects in red light, confirming the number of photoreceptor proteins implicated in the plant circadian system at eleven. The connection between light input mechanisms and temperature effects on the clock is reinforced. Natural genetic variation within PHYC is likely to underlie the PerCv5c QTL. Our results suggest that functional variation within the PHYC-Ler haplotype group might contribute to the evolution of the circadian system and possibly to clock-related phenotypes such as flowering time. These results have previously passed peer-review, so we provide them in this citable preprint.",
