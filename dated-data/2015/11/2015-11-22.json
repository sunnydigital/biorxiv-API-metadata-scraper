    "abstract": "MotivationStudying the pattern of genetic variants is a primary step in deciphering the basis of biological diversity, identifying key  driver variants that affect disease states and evolution of a species. Catalogs of genetic variants contain vast numbers of variants and are growing at an exponential rate, but lack an interactive exploratory interface.\\n\\nResultsWe present BioJS-HGV Viewer, a BioJS component to represent and visualize genetic variants pooled from different sources. The tool displays sequences and variants at different levels of detail, facilitating representation of variant sites and annotations in a user friendly and interactive manner.\\n\\nAvailabilitySource code for BioJS-HGV Viewer is available at: https://github.com/saketkc/biojs-genetic-variation-viewer\\n\\nA demo is available at: http://saketkc.github.io/biojs-genetic-variation-viewer\\n\\nContact: martin@ebi.ac.uk",

    "abstract": "Animals rely on highly sensitive thermoreceptors to seek out optimal temperatures, but the molecular mechanisms of thermosensing are not well understood. The Dorsal Organ Cool Cells (DOCCs) of the Drosophila larva are a set of exceptionally thermosensitive neurons critical for larval cool avoidance. Here we show that DOCC cool-sensing is mediated by Ionotropic Receptors (IRs), a family of sensory receptors widely studied in invertebrate chemical sensing. We find that two IRs, IR21a and IR25a, are required to mediate DOCC responses to cooling and are required for cool avoidance behavior. Furthermore, we find that ectopic expression of IR21a can confer cool-responsiveness in an Ir25a-dependent manner, suggesting an instructive role for IR21a in thermosensing. Together, these data show that IR family receptors can function together to mediate thermosensation of exquisite sensitivity.",
