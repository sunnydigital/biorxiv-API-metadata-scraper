    "abstract": "Following the increase in available sequenced genomes, tissue-specific transcriptomes are being determined for a rapidly growing number of highly diverse species. Traditionally, only the transcriptomes of related species with equivalent tissues have been compared. Such an analysis is much more challenging over larger evolutionary distances when complementary tissues cannot readily be defined. Here, we present a method for the cross-species mapping of tissue-specific and developmental gene expression patterns across a wide range of animals, including many non-model species. Our approach maps gene expression patterns between species without requiring the definition of homologous tissues. With the help of this mapping, gene expression patterns can be compared even across distantly related species. In our survey of 36 datasets across 27 species, we detected conserved expression programs on all taxonomic levels, both within animals and between the animals and their closest unicellular relatives, the choanoflagellates. We found that the rate of change in tissue expression patterns is a property of gene families. Our findings open new avenues of study for the comparison and transfer of knowledge between different species.",

    "abstract": "XWAS is a new software suite for the analysis of the X chromosome in association studies and similar studies. The X chromosome plays an important role in human disease, especially those with sexually dimorphic characteristics. Special attention needs to be given to its analysis due to the unique inheritance pattern, which leads to analytical complications that have resulted in the majority of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) either not considering X or mishandling it with toolsets that had been designed for non-sex chromosomes. We hence developed XWAS to fill the need for tools that are specially designed for analysis of X. Following extensive, stringent, and X-specific quality control, XWAS offers an array of statistical tests of association, including: (1) the standard test between a SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) and disease risk, including after first stratifying individuals by sex, (2) a test for a differential effect of a SNP on disease between males and females, (3) motivated by X-inactivation, a test for higher variance of a trait in heterozygous females as compared to homozygous females, and (4) for all tests, a version that allows for combining evidence from all SNPs across a gene. We applied the toolset analysis pipeline to 16 GWAS datasets of immune-related disorders and 7 risk factors of coronary artery disease, and discovered several new X-linked genetic associations. XWAS will provide the tools and incentive for others to incorporate the X chromosome into GWAS, hence enabling discoveries of novel loci implicated in many diseases and in their sexual dimorphism.",

These models are: Langmuir, Hill-Sips, Brouers-Sotolongo, Brouers-Gaspard, and Redlich-Peterson models. The coefficients of each model were determined by non-linear fitting using Mathematica9 program. The maximum Pb(II) removal rate increased with the increase of temperature and reached the maximum value (98%) at the temperature of 40 {degrees}C. Even if the R2 error quantity is not the unique and always the best measure for nonlinear fitting, the Brouers-Sotolongo model gives in all cases the best fit and is definitely the most suitable one to satisfactorily describe bioisorption of Pb(II) on the algal biomass. In addition, this study shows that a complete set of data is necessary to have a good representation of the isotherm.",

On each of k folds of the process, k-1 of k independent subsets of the data (training set) are used to fit the parameters of each model and the left-out subset (test set) is used to estimate predictive performance. The method is statistically efficient, because training data are reused for testing and performance estimates combined across folds. The method requires no assumptions, provides nearly unbiased (slightly conservative) estimates of predictive performance, and is generally applicable because it amounts to a direct empirical test of each model.",

Confidence can be framed as an objective mathematical quantity the Bayesian posterior probability, providing a formal definition of statistical decision confidence. Here we use this definition as a starting point to develop a normative statistical framework for decision confidence. We analytically prove interrelations between statistical decision confidence and other observable decision measures. Among these is a counterintuitive property of confidence that the lowest average confidence occurs when classifiers err in the presence of the strongest evidence. These results lay the foundations for a mathematically rigorous treatment of decision confidence that can lead to a common framework for understanding confidence across different research domains, from human behavior to neural representations.",

    "abstract": "The majority of disease-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside in noncoding regions of the genome with regulatory roles. Thus being able to interpret the functional consequence of a variant is essential for identifying causal variants in the analysis of GWAS studies. We present GERV (Generative Evaluation of Regulatory Variants), a novel computational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. GERV learns a k-mer based generative model of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by computing the change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate allele. The k-mers learned by GERV capture more sequence determinants of transcription factor binding than a motif-based approach alone, including both a transcription factors canonical motif as well as associated co-factor motifs. We show that GERV outperforms existing methods in predicting SNPs associated with allele-specific binding. GERV correctly predicts a validated causal variant among linked SNPs, and prioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for functionally an-notating and prioritizing causal variants for experimental follow-up analysis. The implementation of GERV and related data are available at http://gerv.csail.mit.edu/",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas technology allows rapid, site-specific genome modification in a wide variety of organisms. CRISPR components produced by integrated transgenes have been shown to mutagenise some genomic target sites in Drosophila melanogaster with high efficiency, but whether this is a general feature of this system remains unknown. Here, we systematically evaluate available CRISPR/Cas reagents and experimental designs in Drosophila. Our findings allow evidence-based choices of Cas9 sources and strategies for generating knock-in alleles. We perform gene editing at a large number of target sites using a highly active Cas9 line and a collection of transgenic gRNA strains. The vast majority of target sites can be mutated with remarkable efficiency using these tools. We contrast our method to recently developed autonomous gene drive technology for genome engineering (Gantz & Bier, 2015) and conclude that optimised CRISPR with independent transgenes is as efficient, more versatile and does not represent a biosafety risk.",

    "abstract": "Identification of protein complexes from proteomic experiments is crucial to understand not only their function but also the principles of cellular organization. Advances in experimental techniques have enabled the construction of large-scale protein-protein interaction networks, and computational methods have been developed to analyze high-throughput data. In most cases several parameters are introduced that have to be trained before application. But how do we select the parameter values when there are no training data available? How many data do we need to properly train a method. How is the performance of a method affected when we incorrectly select the parameter values? The above questions, although important to determine the applicability of a method, are most of the time over-looked. We highlight the importance of such an analysis by investigating how limited knowledge, in the form of incomplete training data, affects the performance of parametric protein-complex prediction algorithms. Furthermore, we develop a simple non-parametric method that does not rely on the existence of training data and we compare it with the parametric alternatives. Using datasets from yeast and fly we demonstrate that parametric methods trained with limited data provide sub-optimal predictions, while our non-parametric method performs better or is on par with the parametric alternatives. Overall, our analysis questions, at least for the specific problem, whether parametric methods provide significantly better results than non-parametric ones to justify the additional effort for applying them.",

Following this we compared macroecological analyses of current and natural diversity patterns to assess if human-induced range changes bias for evolutionary and ecological analyses based on current diversity patterns.\\n\\nResultsWe find that current diversity patterns have been drastically modified by humans, mostly due to global extinctions and regional to local extirpations. Current and natural diversities exhibit marked deviations virtually everywhere outside sub-Saharan Africa. These differences are strongest for terrestrial megafauna, but also important for all mammals combined. The human-induced changes led to biases in estimates of environmental diversity drivers, especially for terrestrial megafauna, but also for all mammals combined.\\n\\nMain conclusionsOur results show that fundamental diversity patterns have been reshaped by human-driven extinctions and extirpations, highlighting humans as a major force in the Earth system. We thereby emphasize that estimating natural distributions and diversities is important to improve our understanding of the evolutionary and ecologically drivers of diversity as well as for providing a benchmark for conservation.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of cooperation--costly behavior that benefits others--faces one clear obstacle. Namely, cooperators are always at a competitive disadvantage relative to defectors, individuals that reap the same social benefits, but evade the personal cost. One solution to this problem involves genetic hitchhiking, where the allele encoding cooperative behavior becomes linked to a beneficial mutation. While traditionally seen as a passive process driven purely by chance, here we explore a more active form of hitchhiking. Specifically, we model hitchhiking in the context of adaptation to a stressful environment by cooperators and defectors with spatially limited dispersal. Under such conditions, clustered cooperators reach higher local densities, thereby experiencing more opportunities for mutations than defectors. Thus, the allele encoding cooperation has a greater probability of hitchhiking with alleles conferring stress adaptation. We label this probabilistic enhancement the \\\"Hankshaw effect\\\" after the character Sissy Hankshaw, whose anomalously large thumbs made her a singularly effective hitchhiker. Using an agent-based model, we demonstrate that there exists a broad set of conditions allowing the evolution of cooperation through the Hankshaw effect. We discuss the feasibility of our theoretical assumptions for natural systems, not only for the case of cooperation, but also for other costly social behaviors such as spite. The primary elements of our model, including genetic hitchhiking and population structure, have been discussed separately in previous models exploring the evolution of cooperation. However, the combination of these elements has not been appreciated as a solution to the problem of cooperation.",
