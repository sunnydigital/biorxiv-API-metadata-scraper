    "abstract": "Phylogenetic comparative methods are increasingly used to give new insight into variation, causes and consequences of trait variation among species. The foundation of these methods is a suite of models that attempt to capture evolutionary patterns by extending the Brownian constant variance model. However, the parameters of these models have been hypothesised to be biased and only asymptotically behave in a statistically predictable way as datasets become large. This does not seem to be widely appreciated. We show that a commonly used model in evolutionary biology (the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model) is biased over a wide range of conditions. Many studies fitting this model use datasets that are small and prone to substantial biases. Our results suggest that simulating fitted models and comparing with empirical results is critical when fitting OU and other extensions of the Brownian model.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays a key role in gene regulation. Previous studies have investigated its genetic basis by mapping genetic variants that are associated with DNA methylation at specific sites, but these have been limited to microarrays that cover less than 2% of the genome and cannot account for allele-specific methylation (ASM). Other studies have performed whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on a few individuals, but these lack statistical power to identify variants associated with DNA methylation. We present a novel approach in which bisulfite-treated DNA from many individuals is sequenced together in a single pool, resulting in a truly genome-wide map of DNA methylation. Compared to methods that do not account for ASM, our approach increases statistical power to detect associations while sharply reducing cost, effort, and experimental variability. As a proof of concept, we generated deep sequencing data from a pool of 60 human cell lines; we evaluated almost twice as many CpGs as the largest microarray studies and identified over 2,000 genetic variants associated with DNA methylation. We found that these variants are highly enriched for associations with chromatin accessibility and CTCF binding but are less likely to be associated with traits indirectly linked to DNA, such as gene expression and disease phenotypes. In summary, our approach allows genome-wide mapping of genetic variants associated with DNA methylation in any tissue of any species, without the need for individual-level genotype or methylation data.",

    "abstract": "Coherent percepts emerge from the accurate combination of inputs from the different sensory systems. There is ongoing debate about the neurophysiological implementation of crossmodal interactions in the brain, and it has been proposed that transient synchronization of neurons might be of central importance. Specifically, oscillatory activity in lower frequency ranges (< 30 Hz) has been implicated in mediating long-range communication as typically studied in multisensory research. In the current study, we recorded high-density electroencephalograms (EEG) while human participants were engaged in a visual-tactile pattern matching paradigm. Employing the same physical stimulation, separate tasks of the experiment either required the detection of predefined targets in visual and tactile modalities or the explicit evaluation of crossmodal stimulus congruence. Analysis of the behavioral data showed benefits for congruent visual-tactile stimulus combinations. Differences in oscillatory dynamics within the two tasks related to crossmodal congruence involved effects in the theta-(2-7 Hz), alpha-(813 Hz) and beta-band (13-25 Hz). Contrasting neuronal activity between the two tasks revealed differences in pre-stimulus alpha- and beta-band power, as well as differences in post-stimulus theta-band activity. Source reconstruction for these effects showed prominent involvement of superior temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices - regions commonly implicated in multisensory integration. These results add to the increasing evidence that low frequency oscillations are well suited for studying integration in distributed brain networks, as demonstrated for crossmodal interactions in visual-tactile pattern matching in the current study. Additionally, neuronal activity at theta-, alpha- and beta-frequencies might subserve distinct processes relevant for multisensory integration, such as multisensory gating and crossmodal perceptual decision making.",

    "abstract": "Protein expression and post-translational modification levels are tightly regulated in neoplastic cells to maintain cellular processes known as  cancer hallmarks. The first Pan-Cancer initiative of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has aggregated protein expression profiles for 3,467 patient samples from 11 tumor types using the antibody based reverse phase protein array (RPPA) technology. The resultant proteomic data can be utilized to computationally infer protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and to study the commonalities and differences across tumor types. In this study, we compare the performance of 13 established network inference methods in their capacity to retrieve literature-curated pathway interactions from RPPA data. We observe that no single method has the best performance in all tumor types, but a group of six methods, including diverse techniques such as correlation, mutual information, and regression, consistently rank highly among the tested methods. A consensus network from this high-performing group reveals that signal transduction events involving receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), the RAS/MAPK pathway, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, as well as innate and adaptive immunity signaling, are the most significant PPIs shared across all tumor types. Our results illustrate the utility of the RPPA platform as a tool to study proteomic networks in cancer.\\n\\nAvailabilityPPI networks from the TCGA or user-provided data can be visualized with the ProtNet web application at http://www.sanderlab.org/protnet/.",

    "abstract": "Current biology is perplexed by the lack of a theoretical framework for understanding the organization principles of the molecular system within a cell. Here we first studied growth rate, one of the seemingly most complex cellular traits, using functional data of yeast single-gene deletion mutants. We observed nearly one thousand expression informative genes (EIGs) whose expression levels are linearly correlated to the trait within an unprecedentedly large functional space. A simple model considering six EIG-formed protein modules revealed a variety of novel mechanistic insights, and also explained [~]50% of the variance of cell growth rates measured by Bar-seq technique for over 400 yeast mutants (Pearsons R = 0.69), a performance comparable to the microarray-based (R = 0.77) or colony-size-based (R = 0.66) experimental approach. We then applied the same strategy to 501 morphological traits of the yeast and achieved successes in most fitness-coupled traits each with hundreds of trait-specific EIGs. Surprisingly, there is no any EIG found for most fitness-uncoupled traits, indicating that they are controlled by super-complex epistases that allow no simple expression-trait correlation. Thus, EIGs are recruited exclusively by natural selection, which builds a rather simple functional architecture for fitness-coupled traits, and the endless complexity of a cell lies primarily in its fitness-uncoupled features.",

    "abstract": "The rapidly expanding body of available genomic and protein structural data provides a rich resource for understanding protein dynamics with biomolecular simulation. While computational infrastructure has grown rapidly, simulations on an omics scale are not yet widespread, primarily because software infrastructure to enable simulations at this scale has not kept pace. It should now be possible to study protein dynamics across entire (super)families, exploiting both available structural biology data and conformational similarities across homologous proteins. Here, we present a new tool for enabling high-throughput simulation in the genomics era. Ensembler takes any set of sequences--from a single sequence to an entire superfamily-- and shepherds them through various stages of modeling and refinement to produce simulation-ready structures. This includes comparative modeling to all relevant PDB structures (which may span multiple conformational states of interest), reconstruction of missing loops, addition of missing atoms, culling of nearly identical structures, assignment of appropriate protonation states, solvation in explicit solvent, and refinement and filtering with molecular simulation to ensure stable simulation. The output of this pipeline is an ensemble of structures ready for subsequent molecular simulations using computer clusters, supercomputers, or distributed computing projects like Folding@home. Ensembler thus automates much of the time consuming process of preparing protein models suitable for simulation, while allowing scalability up to entire superfamilies. A particular advantage of this approach can be found in the construction of kinetic models of conformational dynamics--such as Markov state models (MSMs)--which benefit from a diverse array of initial configurations that span the accessible conformational states to aid sampling. We demonstrate the power of this approach by constructing models for all catalytic domains in the human tyrosine kinase family, using all available kinase catalytic domain structures from any organism as structural templates.\\n\\nEnsembler is free and open source software licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.

    "abstract": "Recent advances in genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction paved the way to the use of quantitative modelings such as FBA. However, despite the great interest of these techniques to tackle quantitative features, microbial community modeling remains unclear. Whereas studies represent a microbial community with several compartments for each microbial strains and their common pool, others advocate for the use of a single compartment that combines all reactions. Here we show that both modelings lead to different optimal quantitative solutions. This study illustrates this difference by the use of the flux module technique, that describes, in a compact way, the optimal solution space as computed by FBA-like techniques. For application, this paper computes the flux modules of a hot spring microbial community (represented by Synechococcus spp., Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus spp.) and a microbial methagenic system (Desulvovibrio vulgaris and Methanococcus maripaludis) sulfate reducing bacteria), while emphasizing the quantitative changes that occurs when one assumes either the consortium as a \\\"single compartment\\\" or a multiple compartment.",

These volumetric differences represent changes in investment, processing capacity and/or connectivity, and can be used to investigate functional and evolutionary relationships between different brain regions, and between brain composition and behavioral ecology. Here, we describe the brain composition of two species of Heliconius butterflies, a long-standing study system for investigating ecological adaptation and speciation. We confirm a previous report of striking mushroom body expansion, and explore patterns of post-eclosion growth and experience-dependent plasticity in neural development. This analysis uncovers age-and experience-dependent post-emergence mushroom body growth comparable to that in foraging hymenoptera, but also identifies plasticity in several other neuropil. An interspecific analysis indicates that Heliconius display remarkable levels of investment in mushroom bodies for a lepidopteran, and indeed rank highly compared to other insects. Our analyses lay the foundation for future comparative and experimental analyses that will establish Heliconius as a useful case study in evolutionary neurobiology.",

Unexpectedly, artificial water recreation systems e.g. swimming pools account for 90% of these outbreaks. It is therefore essential that pool waters be regularly monitored for deviations from microbial water quality guidelines. To assess the sanitary quality of a club swimming pool in Ile-Ife, Nigeria, I used the multiple-tube fermentation technique to determine the most probable number (MPN) of coliform bacteria in 100 ml of pool water. MPN estimates ranged from 9 to 93 with geometric mean of 38. Escherichia coli was isolated from positive presumptive tubes, indicating recent faecal contamination. The isolate elicited similar biochemical reactions as reference E. coli (ATCC-25922), except that it utilized sucrose and liquefied gelatin, which probably indicates potential pathogenicity. Also, the E. coli isolate was resistant to 13 antibiotics from 9 different classes. Finally, coliform counts and detection of E. coli clearly violates international guidelines. I recommend that pool operators increase water disinfection efficiency and educate the public on the need for improved swimmer hygiene to reduce the risk of recreational water illness transmission.\\n\\nConflicts of InterestThe author declares no conflict of interest.",

    "abstract": "Most methods for performing a phylogenetic analysis based on sequence alignments of gene data assume that the mechanism of evolution is constant through time. It is recognised that some sites do evolve somewhat faster than others, and this can be captured using a (gamma) rate heterogeneity model. Further, some species have shorter replication times than others, and this results in faster rates of substitution in some lineages. This feature of lineage specific rate variation can be captured to some extent, by using relaxed clock models. However, it is also clear that there are additional poorly characterised features of sequence data that can sometimes lead to extreme differences in lineage specific rates. This variation is poorly captured by constant time reversible substitution models. The significance of extreme lineage specific rate differences is that they lead both to errors in reconstructing evolutionary relationships as well as biased estimates for the age of ancestral nodes. We propose a new model that allows gamma rate heterogeneity to change on branches, thus offering a more realistic model of sequence evolution. It adds negligible computational cost to likelihood calculations. We illustrate its effectiveness with an example of green algae and land-plants. For many real world data sets, we find a much better fit with multi-gamma sites models as well as substantial differences in ancestral node date estimates.",
