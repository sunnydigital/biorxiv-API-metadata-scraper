    "abstract": "The pursuit of circuits and metabolic pathways of increasing complexity and ro-bustness in synthetic biology will require engineering new regulatory tools. Feedback control based on relevant molecules, including toxic intermediates and environmental signals, would enable genetic circuits to react appropriately to changing conditions. In this work, variants of qacR, a tetR family repressor, were generated by computational protein design and screened in a cell-free transcription-translation (TX-TL) system for responsiveness to a new targeted effector. The modified repressors target vanillin, a growth-inhibiting small molecule found in lignocellulosic hydrolysates and other industrial processes. Promising candidates from the in vitro screen were further characterized in vitro and in vivo in a gene circuit. The screen yielded two qacR mutants that respond to vanillin both in vitro and in vivo. We believe this process, a combination of the generation of variants coupled with in vitro screening, can serve as a framework for designing new sensors for other target compounds.",

We show that many existing methods produce large numbers of false positives in cases where the null hypothesis is true by construction and where actual data from RNA-Seq studies are used, as opposed to simulations that make specific assumptions about the nature of the data. We show that some of those mathematical assumptions about the data likely are one of the causes of the false positives, and define a general structure that is not apparently subject to these problems. The best performance was shown by limma-voom and by some simple methods composed of easily understandable steps.",

    "abstract": "Artificial selection has, for decades, provided a powerful approach to study the genetics of adaptation. Using selective-sweep mapping, it is possible to identify genomic regions in populations where the allele-frequencies have diverged during selection. To avoid misleading signatures of selection, it is necessary to show that a sweep has an effect on the selected trait before it can be considered adaptive. Here, we confirm candidate selective-sweeps on a genome-wide scale in one of the longest, on-going bi-directional selection experiments in vertebrates, the Virginia high and low body-weight selected chicken lines. The candidate selective-sweeps represent standing genetic variants originating from the common base-population. Using a deep-intercross between the selected lines, 16 of 99 evaluated regions were confirmed to contain adaptive selective-sweeps based on their association with the selected trait, 56-day body-weight. Although individual additive effects were small, the fixation for alternative alleles in the high and low body-weight lines across these loci contributed at least 40% of the divergence between them and about half of the additive genetic variance present within and between the lines after 40 generations of selection. The genetic variance contributed by the sweeps corresponds to about 85% of the additive genetic variance of the base-population, illustrating that these loci were major contributors to the realised selection-response. Thus, the gradual, continued, long-term selection response in the Virginia lines was likely due to a considerable standing genetic variation in a highly polygenic genetic architecture in the base-population with contributions from a steady release of selectable genetic variation from new mutations and epistasis throughout the course of selection.",

It is related to the number of functional loci involved in explaining variation of a complex trait and the distribution of genetic effects across these loci. Understanding the complexity level of the genetic architecture of complex traits is essential for evaluating the potential power of mapping functional loci and prediction of complex traits. However, there has been no quantitative measurement of the genetic architecture complexity, which makes it difficult to link results from genetic data analysis to such terminology. Inspired by the \\\"Gini index\\\" for measuring income distribution in economics, I develop a genetic architecture score (\\\"GA score\\\") to measure genetic architecture complexity.

Hamilton (1967) to pose such a risk, because as the driving sex chromosome becomes common, the opposite sex becomes rare. We expand on Hamiltons classic model by allowing for the escape from extinction due to evolution of suppressors of X and Y drivers. We explore differences in the two systems in their probability of escape from extinction. Several novel conclusions are evident, including a) that extinction time scales approximately with the log of population size so that even large populations may go extinct quickly, b) extinction risk is driven by the relationship between female fecundity and drive strength, c) anisogamy and the fact that X and Y drive result in sex ratios skewed in opposite directions, mean systems with Y drive are much more likely to go extinct than those with X drive, and d) suppressors are most likely to become established when the strength of drive is intermediate, since weak drive leads to weak selection for suppression and strong drive leads to rapid extinction.",

We present RASQUAL (Robust Allele Specific QUAntitation and quality controL), a novel statistical approach for association mapping that integrates genetic effects and robust modelling of biases in next generation sequencing (NGS) data within a single, probabilistic framework. RASQUAL substantially improves causal variant localisation and sensitivity of association detection over existing methods in RNA-seq, DNaseI-seq and ChIP-seq data. We illustrate how RASQUAL can be used to maximise association detection by generating the first map of chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in a European population using ATAC-seq. Despite a modest sample size, we identified 2,706 independent caQTLs (FDR 10%) and illustrate how RASQUALs improved causal variant localisation provides powerful information for fine-mapping disease-associated variants. We also map \\\"multipeak\\\" caQTLs, identical genetic associations found across multiple, independent open chromatin regions and illustrate how genetic signals in ATAC-seq data can be used to link distal regulatory elements with gene promoters.

    "abstract": "Although Siberia was inhabited by modern humans at an early stage, there is still debate over whether this area remained habitable during the extremely cold period of the Last Glacial Maximum or whether it was subsequently repopulated by peoples with a recent shared ancestry. Previous studies of the genetic history of Siberian populations were hampered by the extensive admixture that appears to have taken place among these populations, since commonly used methods assume a tree-like population history and at most single admixture events. We therefore developed a new method based on the covariance of ancestry components, which we validated with simulated data, in order to investigate this potentially complex admixture history and to distinguish the effects of shared ancestry from prehistoric migrations and contact. We furthermore adapted a previously devised method of admixture dating for use with multiple events of gene flow, and applied these methods to whole-genome genotype data from over 500 individuals belonging to 20 different Siberian ethnolinguistic groups. The results of these analyses indicate that there have indeed been multiple layers of admixture detectable in most of the Siberian populations, with considerable differences in the admixture histories of individual populations, and with the earliest events dated to not more than 4500 years ago. Furthermore, most of the populations of Siberia included here, even those settled far to the north, can be shown to have a southern origin. These results provide support for a recent population replacement in this region, with the northward expansions of different populations possibly being driven partly by the advent of pastoralism, especially reindeer domestication. These newly developed methods to analyse multiple admixture events should aid in the investigation of similarly complex population histories elsewhere.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryWe developed a new method that lets us disentangle complex admixture events and date the individual episodes of gene flow. We applied this method to a large dataset of genome-wide SNP genotypes from a linguistically diverse sample of populations covering the extent of Siberia. Our results demonstrate that these populations have been in intense contact with each other, with most of them carrying more than two, and up to six different ancestries. Nevertheless, as shown by the dates we estimate, these various admixture events have taken place over a relatively short time, with the oldest dating to not more than 4500 years ago. Our results emphasize the enormous impact that contact has had on the genetic history of these Siberian populations, and the methods developed here will be of use in the investigation of admixture events in populations around the world.",

Here, to reduce the impact of the data heterogeneity we introduce a simple normalization method, Ribo-seq Unit Step Transformation (RUST). RUST is robust and outperforms other normalization techniques in the presence of heterogeneous noise. We illustrate how RUST can be used for identifying mRNA sequence features that affect ribosome footprint densities globally. We show that a few parameters extracted with RUST are sufficient for predicting experimental densities with high accuracy. Importantly the application of RUST to 30 publicly available Ribo-seq datasets revealed a substantial variation in sequence determinants of ribosome footprint frequencies, questioning the reliability of Ribo-seq as an accurate representation of local ribosome densities without prior quality control. This emphasizes our incomplete understanding of how protocol parameters affect ribosome footprint densities.",

    "abstract": "The ciliate protozoan Tetrahymena thermophila contains two types of structurally and functionally differentiated nuclei: the transcriptionally active somatic macronucleus (MAC) and the transcriptionally silent germ-line micronucleus (MIC). Here we demonstrate that MAC features well-positioned nucleosomes downstream of transcription start sites (TSS) likely connected with promoter proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II, as well as in exonic regions flanking both the 5 and 3 splice sites. In contrast, nucleosomes in MIC are more delocalized. Nucleosome occupancy in MAC and MIC are nonetheless highly correlated with each other and with predictions based upon DNA sequence features. Arrays of well-positioned nucleosomes are often correlated with GC content oscillations, suggesting significant contributions from cis-determinants. We propose that cis- and trans-determinants may coordinately accommodate some well-positioned nucleosomes with important functions, driven by a process in which positioned nucleosomes shape the mutational landscape of associated DNA sequences, while the DNA sequences in turn reinforce nucleosome positioning.",

We compared Her2-SRM expression with IHC/FISH, seeking to determine optimal SRM expression cut-offs to identify HER2 amplification.\\n\\nResultsAfter demonstrating assay development, precision, and stability, Her2-SRM measurement was observed to be highly concordant with HER2/CEP17 ratio, particularly in a multivariate regression model adjusted for SRM-expression of Met, Egfr, Her3, and HER2-heterogeneity covariates, and their interactions (cell lines r2=0.9842; FFPE r2=0.7643). In GEC tissues, Her2-SRM was detected in 71.2% of cases, and 12.3% were identified as  HER2+. ROC curves demonstrated HER2-SRM levels to have high specificity (100%) at an upper-level cut-off of >750 amol/g and sensitivity (75%) at lower-level cut-off of <450 amol/ug.

    "abstract": "Genome-wide expression profiling is a cost-efficient and widely used method to characterize heterogeneous populations of cells, tissues, biopsies, or other biological specimen. The exploratory analysis of such datasets typically relies on generic unsupervised methods, e.g. principal component analysis or hierarchical clustering. However, generic methods fail to exploit the significant amount of knowledge that exists about the molecular functions of genes. Here, I introduce GO-PCA, an unsupervised method that incorporates prior knowledge about gene functions in the form of gene ontology (GO) annotations. GO-PCA aims to discover and represent biological heterogeneity along all major axes of variation in a given dataset, while suppressing heterogeneity due to technical biases. To this end, GO-PCA combines principal component analysis (PCA) with nonparametric GO enrichment analysis, and uses the results to generate expression signatures based on small sets of functionally related genes. I first applied GO-PCA to expression data from diverse lineages of the human hematopoietic system, and obtained a small set of signatures that captured known cell characteristics for most lineages. I then applied the method to expression profiles of glioblastoma (GBM) tumor biopsies, and obtained signatures that were strongly associated with multiple previously described GBM subtypes. Surprisingly, GO-PCA discovered a cell cycle-related signature that exhibited significant differences between the Proneural and the prognostically favorable GBM CpG Island Methylator (G-CIMP) subtypes, suggesting that the G-CIMP subtype is characterized in part by lower mitotic activity. Previous expression-based classifications have failed to separate these subtypes, demonstrating that GO-PCA can detect heterogeneity that is missed by other methods. My results show that GO-PCA is a powerful and versatile expression-based method that facilitates exploration of large-scale expression data, without requiring additional types of experimental data. The low-dimensional representation generated by GO-PCA lends itself to interpretation, hypothesis generation, and further analysis.",

SweepFinder uses information on the spatial pattern of the site frequency spectrum (SFS) around the selected locus. To avoid confounding effects of background selection and variation in the mutation process along the genome, the method is typically applied only to sites that are variable within species. However, the power to detect and localize selective sweeps can be greatly improved if invariable sites are also included in the analysis. In the spirit of a Hudson-Kreitman-Aguade test, we suggest to add fixed differences relative to an outgroup to account for variation in mutation rate, thereby facilitating more robust and powerful analyses. We also develop a method for including background selection modeled as a local reduction in the effective population size. Using simulations we show that these advances lead to a gain in power while maintaining robustness to mutation rate variation.
