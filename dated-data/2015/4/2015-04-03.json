    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWPredators often consume multiple prey and by mutually subsidizing a shared predator, the prey may reciprocally harm each other. When predation levels are high, this apparent competition can culminate in a prey species being displaced. Coupling quantitative genetics and Lotka-Volterra models, we study how predator evolution alters this and other ecological outcomes. These models account for a trade-off between the predators attack rates on two prey species. We provide a mathematical characterization of a strong form of persistence-permanence-for which there is a global attractor bounded away from extinction. When the evolutionary dynamics occur at a sufficiently slower time scale than the ecological dynamics, we also characterize attractors and their basins of attraction using singular perturbation theory and a graphical approach to the eco-evolutionary dynamics. Our results show that eco-evolutionary feedbacks can mediate permanence at intermediate trade-offs in the attack rates. However, at strong trade-offs, permanence is lost. Despite this loss of permanence, there can be attractors supporting coexistence. These attractors, however, may coincide with attractors at which the predator is excluded. Our results highlight that evo-evolutionary feedbacks can alter community structure by mediating coexistence or leading to trait-dependent alternative stable states.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune system provides the first response to pathogen infection and orchestrates the activation of the adaptive immune system. Though a large component of the innate immune response is common to all infections, pathogen-specific responses have been documented as well. The innate immune response is thought to be especially critical for fighting infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB). While TB can be deadly, only 5-10% of individuals infected with MTB develop active disease. The risk for disease susceptibility is, at least partly, heritable. Studies of inter-individual variation in the innate immune response to MTB infection may therefore shed light on the genetic basis for variation in susceptibility to TB. Yet, to date, we still do not know which properties of the innate immune response are specific to MTB infection and which represent a general response to pathogen infection. To begin addressing this gap, we infected macrophages with eight different bacteria, including different MTB strains and related mycobacteria, and studied the transcriptional response to infection. Although the ensued gene regulatory responses were largely consistent across the bacterial infection treatments, we were able to identify a novel subset of genes whose regulation was affected specifically by infection with mycobacteria. Genetic variants that are associated with regulatory differences in these genes should be considered candidate loci for explaining inter-individual susceptibility TB.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryTuberculosis (TB) is a deadly disease responsible for millions of deaths annually. It is caused by infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), an ancient human pathogen. Approximately a third of the worlds population is infected with MTB, yet only an estimated 5-10% of individuals will develop an active form of the disease. While this variation in TB susceptibility has been demonstrated to be heritable, we still know little about its underlying genetic basis. The genetic variation that affects TB susceptibility likely involves the innate immune system, which is our first line of defense against invading pathogens, because infection with MTB does not prevent future infections. However, we do not fully understand how the innate immune system differs in its response to MTB versus other bacteria. To investigate this further, we infected macrophages with MTB, related mycobacteria, and other bacteria, and measured how their gene expression levels changed in response. We identified a subset of genes that respond preferentially to infection with mycobacterial species. These genes provide insight into the interactions between MTB and the innate immune system and are candidate loci for explaining inter-individual susceptibility to TB.",

    "abstract": "Although initial studies suggested that Denisovan ancestry was found only in modern human populations from island Southeast Asia and Oceania, more recent studies have suggested that Denisovan ancestry may be more widespread. However, the geographic extent of Denisovan ancestry has not been determined, and moreover the relationship between the Denisovan ancestry in Oceania and that elsewhere has not been studied. Here we analyze genome-wide SNP data from 2493 individuals from 221 worldwide populations, and show that there is a widespread signal of a very low level of Denisovan ancestry across Eastern Eurasian and Native American (EE/NA) populations. We also verify a higher level of Denisovan ancestry in Oceania than that in EE/NA; the Denisovan ancestry in Oceania is correlated with the amount of New Guinea ancestry, but not the amount of Australian ancestry, indicating that recent gene flow from New Guinea likely accounts for signals of Denisovan ancestry across Oceania. However, Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA populations is equally correlated with their New Guinea or their Australian ancestry, suggesting a common source for the Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA and Oceanian populations. Our results suggest that Denisovan ancestry in EE/NA is derived either from common ancestry with, or gene flow from, the common ancestor of New Guineans and Australians, indicating a more complex history involving East Eurasians and Oceanians than previously suspected.",

    "abstract": "Multiple pterygium syndromes (MPS) are a phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous group of rare Mendelian conditions characterized by multiple pterygia, scoliosis and congenital contractures of the limbs. MPS typically segregates as an autosomal recessive disorder but rare instances of autosomal dominant transmission have been reported. While several mutations causing recessive MPS have been identified, the genetic basis of dominant MPS remains unknown. We identified four families with dominantly transmitted MPS characterized by pterygia, camptodactyly of the hands, vertebral fusions, and scoliosis. Exome sequencing identified predicted protein-altering mutations in embryonic myosin heavy chain (MYH3) in three families. MYH3 mutations underlie distal arthrogryposis types 1, 2A and 2B, but all mutations reported to date occur in the head and neck domains. In contrast, two of the mutations found to cause MPS occurred in the tail domain. The phenotypic overlap among persons with MPS coupled with physical findings distinct from other conditions caused by mutations in MYH3, suggests that the developmental mechanism underlying MPS differs from other conditions and / or that certain functions of embryonic myosin may be perturbed by disruption of specific residues / domains. Moreover, the vertebral fusions in persons with MPS coupled with evidence of MYH3 expression in bone suggests that embryonic myosin plays a previously unknown role in skeletal development.",

    "abstract": "The problems with classical frequentist statistics have recently received much attention, yet the enthusiasm of researchers to adopt alternatives like Bayesian inference remains modest. Here I present the bootstrapped evidence test, an objective resampling procedure that takes the precision with which both the experimental and null hypothesis can be estimated into account. Simulations and reanalysis of actual experimental data demonstrate that this test minimizes false positives while maintaining sensitivity. It is equally applicable to a wide range of situations and thus minimizes problems arising from analytical flexibility. Critically, it does not dichotomize the results based on an arbitrary significance level but instead quantifies how well the data support either the alternative or the null hypothesis. It is thus particularly useful in situations with considerable uncertainty about the expected effect size. Because it is non-parametric, it is also robust to severe violations of assumptions made by classical statistics.",
