    "abstract": "Many species are shifting their ranges in response to global climate change. The evolution of dispersal during range expansion increases invasion speed, provided that a species can adapt sufficiently fast to novel local conditions. Mutation rates can evolve too, under conditions that favor an increased rate of adaptation. However, evolution at the mutator gene has thus far been deemed of minor importance in sexual populations due to its dependence on genetic hitchhiking with a beneficial mutation at a gene under selection, and thus its sensitivity to recombination. Here we use an individual-based model to show that the mutator gene and the gene under selection can be effectively linked at the population level during invasion. This causes the evolutionary increase of mutation rates in sexual populations, even if they are not linked at the individual level. The observed evolution of mutation rate is adaptive and clearly advances range expansion both through its effect on the evolution of dispersal rate, and the evolution of local adaptation. In addition, we observe the evolution of mutation rates in a spatially stable population under strong directional selection, but not when we add variance to the mean selection pressure. By this we extend the existing theory on the evolution of mutation rates, which is generally thought to be limited to asexual populations, with possibly far-reaching consequences concerning invasiveness and the rate at which species can adapt to novel environmental conditions as experienced under global climate change.",

    "abstract": "Determining the methylation state of regions with high copy numbers is challenging for second-generation sequencing, because the read length is insufficient to map reads uniquely, especially when repetitive regions are long and nearly identical to each other. Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing is a promising method for observing such regions, because it is not vulnerable to GC bias, it performs long read lengths, and its kinetic information is sensitive to DNA modifications. We propose a novel algorithm that combines the kinetic information for neighboring CpG sites and increases the confidence in identifying the methylation states of those sites. Both the sensitivity and precision of our algorithm were [~]93.7% on CpG site basis for the genome of an inbred medaka (Oryzias latipes) strain within a practical read coverage of [~]30-fold. The method is quantitatively accurate because we observed a high correlation coefficient (R = 0.884) between our method and bisulfite sequencing, and 92.0% of CpG sites were in concordance within 0.25. Using this method, we characterized the landscape of the methylation status of repetitive elements, such as LINEs, in the human genome, thereby revealing the strong correlation between CpG density and unmethylation and detecting unmethylation hot spots of LTRs and LINEs. We could uncover the methylation states for nearly identical active transposons, two novel LINE insertions of identity [~]99% and length 6050 base pairs (bp) in the human genome, and sixteen Tol2 elements of identity >99.8% and length 4682 bp in the medaka genome.",

    "abstract": "Aberrant DNA methylation has long been implicated in cancers. In this work we present a highly discriminative DNA methylation biomarker for non-small cell lung cancers and fourteen other cancers. Based on 69 NSCLC cell lines and 257 cancer-free lung tissues we identified a CpG island in SCT gene promoter which was verified by qMSP experiment in 15 NSCLC cell lines and 3 immortalized human respiratory epithelium cells. In addition, we found that SCT promoter was methylated in 23 cancer cell lines involving >10 cancer types profiled by ENCODE. We found that SCT promoter is hyper-methylated in primary tumors from TCGA lung cancer cohort. Additionally, we found that SCT promoter is methylated at high frequencies in fifteen malignancies and is not methylated in [~]1000 non-cancerous tissues across >30 organ types. Our study indicates that SCT promoter methylation is a highly discriminative biomarker for lung and many other cancers.",

    "abstract": "Genetic interaction can be defined as a deviation of the phenotypic quantitative effect of a double gene mutation from the effect predicted from single mutations using a simple (e.g., multiplicative or linear additive) statistical model. Experimentally characterized genetic interaction networks in model organisms provide important insights into relationships between different biological functions. We describe a computational methodology allowing to systematically and quantitatively characterize a Boolean mathematical model of a biological network in terms of genetic interactions between all loss of function and gain of function mutations with respect to all model phenotypes or outputs. We use the probabilistic framework defined in MaBoSS software, based on continuous time Markov chains and stochastic simulations. In addition, we suggest several computational tools for studying the distribution of double mutants in the space of model phenotype probabilities. We demonstrate this methodology on three published models for each of which we derive the genetic interaction networks and analyze their properties. We classify the obtained interactions according to their class of epistasis, dependence on the chosen initial conditions and phenotype. The use of this methodology for validating mathematical models from experimental data and designing new experiments is discussed.{dagger}",

    "abstract": "Desert locusts (Schistocerca gregaria) show a dramatic form of socially induced phenotypic plasticity known as phase polyphenism. In the absence of conspecifics, locusts occur in a shy and cryptic solitarious phase. Crowding with conspecifics drives a behavioural transformation towards gregariousness that occurs within hours and is followed by changes in physiology, colouration and morphology, resulting in the full gregarious phase syndrome. We analysed methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphisms (MS-AFLP) to compare the effect of acute and chronic crowding on DNA methylation in the central nervous system. We find that crowd-reared and solitary-reared locusts show markedly different neural MS-AFLP fingerprints. However, crowding for a day resulted in neural MS-AFLP fingerprints that were clearly distinct from both crowd-reared and uncrowded solitary-reared locusts. Our results indicate that changes in DNA methylation associated with behavioural gregarisation proceed through intermediate states that are not simply partial realisations of the endpoint states.",

    "abstract": "Microbes are main drivers of biogeochemical cycles in oceans and lakes, yet surprisingly few bacterioplankton genomes have been sequenced, partly due to difficulties in cultivating them. Here we used automatic binning to reconstruct a large number of bacterioplankton genomes from a metagenomic time-series from the Baltic Sea. The genomes represent novel species within freshwater and marine clades, including clades not previously genome-sequenced. Their seasonal dynamics followed phylogenetic patterns, but with fine-grained lineage specific adaptations. Signs of streamlining were evident in most genomes, and estimated genome sizes correlated with abundance variation across filter size fractions. Comparing the genomes with globally distributed aquatic metagenomes suggested the existence of a global brackish metacommunity whose populations diverged from freshwater and marine relatives >100,000 years ago, hence long before the Baltic Sea was formed (8000 years). This markedly contrasts to most Baltic Sea multicellular organisms that are locally adapted populations of fresh- or marine counterparts.",

    "abstract": "A method of sequencing peptides using tandem cells (RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 167-171; RSC Adv., 2015, 5, 30694-30700) and peptidases is considered. A double tandem cell (two tandem cells in tandem) has three nanopores in series, an amino-acid-specific endopeptidase attached downstream of the first pore, and an exopeptidase attached downstream of the second pore. The endopeptidase cleaves a peptide threaded through the first pore into fragments that are well separated in time. Fragments pass through the second pore and are each cleaved by the exopeptidase into a series of single residues; the latter pass through the third pore and cause separate current blockades that can be counted. This leads to an ordered list of integers corresponding to the number of residues in each fragment. With 20 cells, one per amino acid type, and 20 peptide copies, the resulting 20 lists of integers are used by a simple algorithm to assemble the sequence. This is a quasi-digital process that uses the lengths of subsequences to sequence the peptide, it differs from conventional analog methods which seek to identify monomers in a polymer via differences in blockade levels, residence times, or transverse currents. Several implementation issues are discussed. In particular the problem of fast analyte translocation, widely considered intransigent, may be resolved through the use of a sufficiently long (40-60 nm) third pore. This translates to a required bandwidth of 1-2 MHz, which is within the range of currently available CMOS circuits.",
