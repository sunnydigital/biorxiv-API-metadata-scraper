    "abstract": "BackgroundGenome-scale \\\"-omics\\\" measurements are challenging to benchmark due to the enormous variety of unique biological molecules involved. Mixtures of previously-characterized samples can be used to benchmark repeatability and reproducibility using component proportions as truth for the measurement. We describe and evaluate experiments characterizing the performance of RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) measurements, and discuss cases where mixtures can serve as effective process controls.\\n\\nResultsWe apply a linear model to total RNA mixture samples in RNA-seq experiments. This model provides a context for performance benchmarking. The parameters of the model fit to experimental results can be evaluated to assess bias and variability of the measurement of a mixture. A linear model describes the behavior of mixture expression measures and provides a context for performance benchmarking. Residuals from fitting the model to experimental data can be used as a metric for evaluating the effect that an individual step in an experimental process has on the linear response function and precision of the underlying measurement while identifying signals affected by interference from other sources. Effective benchmarking requires well-defined mixtures, which for RNA-Seq requires knowledge of the messenger RNA (mRNA) content of the individual total RNA components. We demonstrate and evaluate an experimental method suitable for use in genome-scale process control and lay out a method utilizing spike-in controls to determine mRNA content of total RNA in samples.\\n\\nConclusionsGenome-scale process controls can be derived from mixtures. These controls relate prior knowledge of individual components to a complex mixture, allowing assessment of measurement performance. The mRNA fraction accounts for differential enrichment of mRNA from varying total RNA samples. Spike-in controls can be utilized to measure this relationship between mRNA content and input total RNA. Our mixture analysis method also enables estimation of the proportions of an unknown mixture, even when component-specific markers are not previously known, whenever pure components are measured alongside the mixture.",

    "abstract": "This paper deals with an abstraction of a unified problem of drug discovery and pathogen identification. Here, the \\\"lead compounds\\\" are abstracted as inhibitors, pathogenic proteins as defectives, and the mixture of \\\"ineffective\\\" chemical compounds and non-pathogenic proteins as normal items. A defective could be immune to the presence of an inhibitor in a test. So, a test containing a defective is positive iff it does not contain its \\\"associated\\\" inhibitor. The goal of this paper is to identify the defectives, inhibitors, and their \\\"associations\\\" with high probability, or in other words, learn the Immune Defectives Graph (IDG). We propose a probabilistic non-adaptive pooling design, a probabilistic two-stage adaptive pooling design and decoding algorithms for learning the IDG. For the two-stage adaptive-pooling design, we show that the sample complexity of the number of tests required to guarantee recovery of the inhibitors, defectives and their associations with high probability, i.e., the upper bound, exceeds the proposed lower bound by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of items. For the non-adaptive pooling design, in the large inhibitor regime, we show that the upper bound exceeds the proposed lower bound by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "E-Cadherin (CDH1) genetic variations may be involved in invasion and metastasis of various cancers by altering gene transcriptional activity of epithelial cells. However, published studies on the association of CDH1 gene polymorphisms and prostate cancer (PCA)risk remain contradictory, owing to differences in living habits and genetic backgrounds. To derive a more better and comprehensive conclusion, the present meta-analysis was performed. Electronic searches of several databases were conducted for all publications on the association between the CDH1 -160 C/A polymorphism and prostate cancer before Oct 2014. The odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for statistical analysis. A total of 7 eligible studies including 1294 cases and 1782 controls were involved in this meta-analysis. Overall, meta-analysis indicated that the -160A allele carriers (AA, CA, AA+CA and A allele) had an increased risk of PCA compared with the homozygotes (CC). In the subgroup analyses by ethnicity, a positive association was found in Asians with A allele, AA, CA, AA+CA genotype and Caucasian descendants with AA genotype, dominant and recessive models. On the contrary, a decreased prostate cancer risk was found in Africans with heterozygous, dominant and allele models. Taken together, this meta-analysis showed that the CDH1 -160A allele might be a risk factor for prostate cancer in Asians and Caucasians. However, this result should be verified by additional population-based studies with large sample sizes.",

    "abstract": "Despite extraordinary efforts to profile cancer genomes on a large scale, interpreting the vast amount of genomic data in the light of cancer evolution and in a clinically relevant manner remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that cancer next-generation sequencing data is dominated by the signature of growth governed by a power-law distribution of mutant allele frequencies. The power-law signature is common to multiple tumor types and is a consequence of the effectively-neutral evolutionary dynamics that underpin the evolution of a large proportion of cancers, giving rise to the abundance of mutations responsible for intra-tumor heterogeneity. Importantly, the law allows the measurement, in each individual cancer, of the in vivo mutation rate and the timing of mutations with remarkable precision. This result provides a new way to interpret cancer genomic data by considering the physics of tumor growth in a way that is both patient-specific and clinically relevant.",

    "abstract": "We quantify the VDJ recombination and somatic hypermutation processes in human B-cells using probabilistic inference methods on high-throughput DNA sequence repertoires of human B-cell receptor heavy chains. Our analysis captures the statistical properties of the naive repertoire, first after its initial generation via VDJ recombination and then after selection for functionality. We also infer statistical properties of the somatic hypermutation machinery (exclusive of subsequent effects of selection). Our main results are the following: the B-cell repertoire is substantially more diverse than T-cell repertoires, due to longer junctional insertions; sequences that pass initial selection are distinguished by having a higher probability of being generated in a VDJ recombination event; somatic hypermutations have a non-uniform distribution along the V gene that is well explained by an independent site model for the sequence context around the hypermutation site.",

    "abstract": "MotivationThere are many different forms of genomic structural variation that can be broadly classified into two groups as copy number variation (CNV) and balanced rearrangements. Although many algorithms are now available in the literature that aim to characterize CNVs, discovery of balanced rearrangements (inversions and translocations) remains an open problem. This is mainly because the breakpoints of such events typically lie within segmental duplications and common repeats, which reduce the mappability of short reads. The 1000 Genomes Project spearheaded the development of several methods to identify inversions, however, they are limited to relatively short inversions, and there are currently no available algorithms to discover large inversions using high throughput sequencing technologies (HTS).\\n\\nResultsHere we propose to use a sequencing method (Kitzman et al., 2011) originally developed to improve haplotype phasing to characterize large genomic inversions. This method, called pooled clone sequencing, merges the advantages of clone based sequencing approaches with the speed and cost efficiency of HTS technologies. Using data generated with pooled clone sequencing method, we developed a novel algorithm, dipSeq, to discover large inversions (>500 Kbp). We show the power of dipSeq first on simulated data, and then apply it to the genome of a HapMap individual (NA12878). We were able to accurately discover all previously known and experimentally validated large inversions in the same genome. We also identified a novel inversion, and confirmed using fluorescent in situ hybridization.\\n\\nAvailabilityImplementation of the dipSeq algorithm is available at https://github.com/BilkentCompGen/dipseq\\n\\nContactcalkan@cs.bilkent.edu.tr, francesca.antonacci@uniba.it",
