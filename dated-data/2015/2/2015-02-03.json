    "abstract": "A key feature of cell migration is how cell movement is affected by cell-cell interactions. Furthermore, many cell migratory processes such as neural crest stem cell migration [1, 2] occur on growing domains or in the presence of a chemoattractant. Therefore, it is important to study interactions between migrating cells in the context of domain growth and directed motility. Here we compare discrete and continuum models describing the spatial and temporal evolution of a cell population for different types of cell-cell interactions on static and growing domains. We suggest that cell-cell interactions can be inferred from population density characteristics in the presence of motility bias, and these population density characteristics for different cell-cell interactions are conserved on both static and growing domains. We also study the expected displacement of a tagged cell, and show that different types of cell-cell interactions can give rise to cell trajectories with different characteristics. These characteristics are conserved in the presence of domain growth, however, they are diminished in the presence of motility bias. Our results are relevant for researchers who study the existence and role of cell-cell interactions in biological systems, so far as we suggest that different types of cell-cell interactions could be identified from cell density and trajectory data.",

    "abstract": "Advances in electron cryomicroscopy allow for the building of de novo atomic models into high resolution Coulomb potential maps. While established validation metrics independently assess map quality and model geometry, methods to assess the precise fitting of an atomic model into the map and to validate the interpretation of high resolution features are less well developed. Here, we present EMRinger, which tests model-to-map agreement using side-chain dihedral-directed map density measurements. These measurements reveal local map density peaks and show that peaks located at rotameric angles are a sensitive marker of whether the backbone is correctly positioned. The EMRinger Score can be improved by model refinement, suggesting its utility as an effective model-to-map validation metric. Additionally, EMRinger sampling identifies how radiation damage alters scattering from negatively charged amino acids during data collection. EMRinger will be useful in assessing how advances in cryo-EM increase the ability to resolve and model high-resolution features.",

    "abstract": "SummaryWe have previously examined the impact of neonicotinoid pesticides, dinotefuran and clothianidin, on honeybee Apis mellifera colonies in long-term field experiments when they were simultaneously administered through both vehicles of sugar syrup and pollen paste (Yamada et al., 2012). The independent effect of a pesticide through two vehicles has not been studied in our previous work. In this paper, we investigated the independent impact of dinotefuran through each of the two vehicles. We confirmed that dinotefuran intake per bee until colony extinction due to administration through pollen paste (DF-TIPP) was roughly one-fifth as much as that through sugar syrup (DF-TISS). The intake was largely independent of dinotefuran concentration. We considered the possibility of DF-TIPP per bee as an indicator to assess the impact of persistent pesticide on a honeybee colony in a practical apiary.\\n\\nThis work has replicated the finding that a honeybee colony has dwindled away to nothing after assuming an aspect of a colony collapse disorder (CCD) by administration of the neonicotinoids dinotefuran and clothianidin in our previous work, regardless of the vehicles. In addition, a failure in wintering was observed in case of administration of dinotefuran with the lowest concentration in this work even if the colony appeared vigorous before winter.\\n\\nWe can infer that a CCD and a failure in wintering may have the same roots of chronic toxicity of neonicotinoids under conditions of low concentrations due to the persistency and high toxicity which are characteristic of them.",

    "abstract": "SummaryNeonicotinoides are persistent and highly toxic pesticides that have become popular instead of organophosphates, being suspected to be a trigger of massive disappearance of bees that raises concern in the world. The evaluation of the long-term influence for a whole colony in the natural environment is, however, not established yet. In this paper, we conducted a long-term field experiment and found different impacts on honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera) in an apiary between the neonicotinoid dinotefuran and the organophosphate fenitrothion even though whose concentrations in sugar syrup provided for bees were adjusted to have nearly equal short-term effects on a honeybee based on the median lethal dose (LD50) as well as the insecticidal activity to exterminate stinkbugs.\\n\\nThe colony with administration of dinotefran (dinotefuran colony) became extinct in 26 days, while the colony with administration of fenitrothion (fenitrothion colony) survived the administration for the same period. Furthermore, the fenitrothion colony succeeded to be alive for more than 293 days after administration, and also succeeded an overwintering, which indicates that colonies exposed to fenitrothion can recover after the exposure.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the dinotefuran colony became extinct even though the intake of dinotefuran was estimated to be comparable with that of fenitrothion in terms of the LD50 of a honeybee. Moreover, the colonies in our previous long-term experiments where dinotefuran with higher concentration were administered only for first few days (Yamada et al., 2012) became extinct in 104 days and 162 days, respectively. From these results, we speculate that colonies exposed to dinotefuran hardly recover from the damage because dinotefuran is much more persistent than fenitrothion and toxic foods stored in cells can affect a colony in a long period.",

    "abstract": "Island endemics are likely to experience population bottlenecks; they also have restricted ranges. Therefore we expect island species to have small effective population sizes (Ne) and reduced genetic diversity compared to their mainland counterparts. As a consequence, island species may have inefficient selection and reduced adaptive potential. We used both polymorphisms and substitutions to address these predictions, improving on the approach of recent studies that only used substitution data. This allowed us to directly test the assumption that island species have small values of Ne. We found that island species had significantly less genetic diversity than mainland species; however, this pattern could be attributed to a subset of island species that had undergone a recent population bottleneck. When these species were excluded from the analysis, island and mainland species had similar levels of genetic diversity, despite island species occupying considerably smaller areas than their mainland counterparts. We also found no overall difference between island and mainland species in terms of effectiveness of selection or mutation rate. Our evidence suggests that island colonisation has no lasting impact on molecular evolution. This surprising result highlights gaps in our knowledge of the relationship between census and effective population size.",

    "abstract": "Intracellular processes rarely work in isolation but continually, interact with the rest of the cell. In microbes, for example, we now know that gene expression across the whole genome typically changes with growth rate. The mechanisms driving such global regulation, however, are not well understood. Here we consider three trade-offs that because of limitations in levels of cellular energy, free ribosomes, and proteins are faced by all living cells and construct a mechanistic model that comprises these trade-offs. Our model couples gene expression with growth rate and growth rate with a growing population of cells. We show that the model recovers Monod's law for the growth of microbes and two other empirical relationships connecting growth rate to the mass fraction of ribosomes. Further, we can explain growth related effects in dosage compensation by paralogs and predict host-circuit interactions in synthetic biology. Simulating competitions between strains, we find that the regulation of metabolic pathways may have evolved not to match expression of enzymes to levels of extracellular substrates in changing environments but rather to balance a trade-off between exploiting one type of nutrient over another. Although coarse-grained, the trade-offs that the model embodies are fundamental, and, as such, our modelling framework has potentially wide application, including in both biotechnology and medicine.",
