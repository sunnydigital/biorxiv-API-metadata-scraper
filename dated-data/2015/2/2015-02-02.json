    "abstract": "MotivationIn silico enzymatic digestion tools mostly can be used for digestion of single sequence query, which means a significant limitation in their utility when a number of sequences need to be processed. The other limitation of these applications is the selection options of restriction enzymes that are usually allow only simultaneous digestion. Non-conventional proteins such as cereal prolamins require multi-enzyme multi step digestion, and for cereal proteomics experts this type of application is missing.\\n\\nResultsPDMQ, Protein Digestion Multi Query application was developed having multi query and multi enzyme options and that way can be customized for any digestion protocol.\\n\\nAvailability and implementationPDMQ is implemented in C# using the .NET framework and can be downloaded from http://www.agrar.mta.hu/_user/browser/File/bioinformatics/ProteinDigestion_v0_0_0_15.rar",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVisualization and analysis of molecular profiling data together with biological networks are able to provide new mechanistical insights into biological functions. Currently, high-throughput data are usually visualized on top of predefined network layouts which are not always adapted to a given data analysis task. We developed a Cytoscape app which allows to construct biological network layouts based on the data from molecular profiles imported as values of nodes attributes.\\n\\nResultsDeDaL is a Cytoscape 3.0 app which uses linear and non-linear algorithms of dimension reduction to produce data-driven network layouts based on multidimensional data (typically gene expression). DeDaL implements several data pre-processing and layout post-processing steps such as continuous morphing between two arbitrary network layouts and aligning one network layout with respect to another one by rotating and mirroring. Combining these possibilities facilitates creating insightful network layouts representing both structural network features and the correlation patterns in multivariate data.\\n\\nConclusionsDeDaL is the first method allowing to construct biological network layouts from high-throughput data.

    "abstract": "MotivationProtein database search is one of the fundamental problems in bioinformatics. For decades, it has been explored and solved using different exact and heuristic approaches. However, exponential growth of data in size in recent years has brought significant challenges in improving already existing algorithms. BLASTP has been the most successful tool for protein database search, but is also becoming a bottleneck in many applications. Due to that, many different approaches have been developed to comple-ment or replace BLASTP. In this paper, we present SWORD, an efficient protein database search implementation that runs 3-4 faster than BLASTP in the sensitive mode and up to 18 faster in the fast and less accurate mode and also provides guaranteed optimal alignments for candidate sequences. SWORD is designed to be used in nearly all database search environments, but is especially suitable for large databases. Its sensitivity exceeds that of BLASTP for majority of input datasets.\\n\\nAvailabilitySword is freely available for download from https://github.com/rvaser/sword\\n\\nContactrobert.vaser@fer.hr, mile.sikic@fer.hr",

    "abstract": "Transport of cells and biochemical molecules often takes place in crowded, heterogeneous environments. As such, it is important we understand how to quantify crowded transport phenomena, and the possibilities of extracting transport coefficients from limited observations. We employ a volume-excluding random walk model on a square lattice where different fractions of lattice sites are filled with inert, immobile obstacles to investigate whether it is possible to estimate parameters associated with transport when crowding is present. By collecting and analysing data obtained on multiple spatial scales we demonstrate that commonly used models of motility within crowded environments can be used to reliably predict our random walk data. However, infeasibly large amounts of data are needed to estimate transport parameters, and quantitative estimates may differ depending on the spatial scale on which they are collected. We also demonstrate that in models of crowded environments there is a relatively large region of the parameter space within which it is difficult to distinguish between the \\\"best fit\\\" parameter values. This suggests commonly used descriptions of transport within crowded systems may not be appropriate, and that we should be careful in choosing models to represent the effects of crowding upon motility within biochemical systems.",

    "abstract": "Advances in empirical population genetics have made apparent the need for models that simultaneously account for selection and demography. To address this need, we here study the Wright-Fisher diffusion under selection and variable effective population size. In the case of genic selection and piecewise-constant effective population sizes, we obtain the transition density function by extending a recently developed method for computing an accurate spectral representation for a constant population size. Utilizing this extension, we show how to compute the sample frequency spectrum (SFS) in the presence of genic selection and an arbitrary number of instantaneous changes in the effective population size. We also develop an alternate, efficient algorithm for computing the SFS using a method of moments. We apply these methods to answer the following questions: If neutrality is incorrectly assumed when there is selection, what effects does it have on demographic parameter estimation? Can the impact of negative selection be observed in populations that undergo strong exponential growth?",
