    "abstract": "The evolution of social traits remains one of the most fascinating and feisty topics in evolutionary bi-ology even after half a century of theoretical research. W. D. Hamilton shaped much of the field initially with his 1964 papers that laid out the foundation for understanding the effect of genetic relatedness on the evolution of social behavior. Early theoretical investigations revealed two critical assumptions required for Hamiltons rule to hold in dynamical models: weak selection and additive genetic interactions. However, only recently have analytical approaches from population genetics and evolutionary game theory developed sufficiently so that social evolution can be studied under the joint action of selection, mutation, and genetic drift. We review how these approaches suggest two timescales for evolution under weak mutation: (i) a short-term timescale where evolution occurs between a finite set of alleles, and (ii) a long-term timescale where a continuum of alleles are possible and populations evolve continuously from one monomorphic trait to another. We show how Hamiltons rule emerges from the short-term analysis under additivity and how non-additive genetic interactions can be accounted for more generally. This short-term approach re-produces, synthesizes, and generalizes many previous results including the one-third law from evolutionary game theory and risk dominance from economic game theory. Using the long-term approach, we illustrate how trait evolution can be described with a diffusion equation that is a stochastic analogue of the canonical equation of adaptive dynamics. Peaks in the stationary distribution of the diffusion capture classic notions of convergence stability from evolutionary game theory and generally depend on the additive genetic in-teractions inherent in Hamiltons rule. Surprisingly, the peaks of the long-term stationary distribution can predict the effects of simple kinds of non-additive interactions. Additionally, the peaks capture both weak and strong effects of social payoffs in a manner difficult to replicate with the short-term approach. Together, the results from the short and long-term approaches suggest both how Hamiltons insight may be robust in unexpected ways and how current analytical approaches can expand our understanding of social evolution far beyond Hamiltons original work.",

    "abstract": "1Forecasts of ecological dynamics in changing environments are increasingly important, and are available for a plethora of variables, such as species abundance and distribution, community structure, and ecosystem processes. There is, however, a general absence of knowledge about how far into the future, or other dimensions (space, temperature, phylogenetic distance), useful ecological forecasts can be made, and about how features of ecological systems relate to these distances. The ecological forecast horizon is the dimensional distance for which useful forecasts can be made. Five case studies illustrate the influence of various sources of uncertainty (e.g. parameter uncertainty, environmental , and demographic stochasticity, evolution), level of ecological organisation (e.g. population or community), organismal properties (e.g. body size or number of trophic links) on temporal, spatial, and phylogenetic forecast horizons. Insights from these case studies demonstrate that the ecological forecast horizon is a flexible and powerful tool for researching and communicating ecological predictability. It also has potential for motivating and guiding agenda setting for ecological forecasting research and development.",

    "abstract": "Using robust, integrated analysis of multiple genomic datasets, we show that genes depleted for non-synonymous de novo mutations form a subnetwork of 72 members under strong selective constraint. We further show this subnetwork is preferentially expressed in the early development of the human hippocampus and is enriched for genes mutated in neurological, but not other, Mendelian disorders. We thus conclude that carefully orchestrated developmental processes are under strong constraint in early brain development, and perturbations caused by mutation have adverse outcomes subject to strong purifying selection. Our findings demonstrate that selective forces can act on groups of genes involved in the same process, supporting the notion that adaptation can act coordinately on multiple genes. Our approach provides a statistically robust, interpretable way to identify the tissues and developmental times where groups of disease genes are active. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the interactions between genes when analyzing genome-wide sequence data.",

    "abstract": "Poised (bivalent or paused) chromatin comprises activating and repressing histone modifications at the same location (Voigt et al., 2013). This combination of epigenetic marks keeps genes expressed at low levels but poised for rapid activation (Margaritis and Holstege, 2008; Mikkelsen et al., 2007). Typically, DNA at poised promoters carries low levels of methylation in normal cells (Meissner et al., 2008; Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al., 2015), but frequently shows elevated methylation levels in cancer samples (Hinoue et al., 2012; Gal-Yam et al., 2008; Ohm et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2008; Easwaran et al., 2012). Although higher levels of methylation are normally associated with transcriptional silencing, recently counter-intuitive positive correlations between methylation and expression levels have been reported for two cancer types (Hahn et al., 2014; Kretzmer et al.,). Here, we analyze one of the largest combined expression and methylation data-sets to date, comprising over 5,000 samples and demonstrate that the hypermethylation of poised chromatin in conjunction with up-regulation of the corresponding genes is a general phenomenon in cancer. This up-regulation affects developmental genes and transcription factors, including many genes implicated in cancer. From analysis of 7,000 methylation data sets, we built a universal classifier that can identify cancer samples solely from the hypermethylation status of originally poised chromatin. We reason that the alteration of the epigenetic status of poised chromatin is intimately linked to tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "We analyse patterns of genetic variability of populations in the presence of a large seed bank with the help of a new coalescent structure called the seed bank coalescent. This ancestral process appears naturally as scaling limit of the genealogy of large populations that sustain seed banks, if the seed bank size and individual dormancy times are of the same order as the active population. Mutations appear as Poisson processes on the active lineages, and potentially at reduced rate also on the dormant lineages. The presence of  dormant lineages leads to qualitatively altered times to the most recent common ancestor and non-classical patterns of genetic diversity. To illustrate this we provide a Wright-Fisher model with seed bank component and mutation, motivated from recent models of microbial dormancy, whose genealogy can be described by the seed bank coalescent. Based on our coalescent model, we derive recursions for the expectation and variance of the time to most recent common ancestor, number of segregating sites, pairwise differences, and singletons. Estimates (obtained by simulations) of the distributions of commonly employed distance statistics, in the presence and absence of a seed bank, are compared. The effect of a seed bank on the expected site-frequency spectrum is also investigated using simulations. Our results indicate that the presence of a large seed bank considerably alters the distribution of some distance statistics, as well as the site-frequency spectrum. Thus, one should be able to detect the presence of a large seed bank in genetic data.",
