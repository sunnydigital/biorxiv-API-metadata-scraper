    "abstract": "The numerical model of one-loop circulation exploits viscous deformation as mechanism of ventricular filling. Mathematical advantage of viscous deforming is a possibility to present the ventricular filling as the function of two independent variables (stress and time); two-dimensional argument frames a table which permits to calculate end-diastolic ventricular volume due to information about measured venous pressure and duration of ventricular diastole. The equation was deduced which balances the system while varying of such parameters as arterial resistance, the value of normal rhythm and the volume flow rate. The model pays attention on the phenomenon of asymmetrical position of normal rhythm (the steady rhythm in conditions of rest) and explains why the operating range of brady-rhythms is much narrower than the operating range of tachy-rhythms.",

NeuroVault is easy to use and employs modern web technologies to provide informative visualization of data without the need to install additional software. In addition, it leverages the power of the Neurosynth database to provide cognitive decoding of deposited maps. The data are exposed through a public REST API enabling other services and tools to take advantage of it. NeuroVault is a new resource for researchers interested in conducting meta and coactivation analyses.",

    "abstract": "Brief SummaryWhy do species ranges often end when no obvious change in the environment suggests they should? Our theory explains that there is an inherent limit to adaptation arising in any (finite) natural population, and identifies the key parameters that determine this limit to a species range. Two observable parameters describe the threshold when adaptation fails: i) the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment, and ii) the efficacy of selection relative to stochastic effects in finite populations.\\n\\nAbstractWhy do species not adapt to ever-wider ranges of conditions, gradually expanding their ecological niche and geographic range? Gene flow across environments has two conflicting effects: while it increases genetic variation, which is a prerequisite for adaptation, gene flow may swamp adaptation to local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that when the environment varies across space, \\\"swamping\\\" by gene flow creates a positive feedback between low population size and maladaptation, leading to a sharp range margin. Yet, current deterministic theory shows that when variance can evolve, there is no such limit. Using simple analytical tools and simulations, we show that genetic drift can generate a sharp margin to a species range, by reducing genetic variance below the level needed for adaptation to spatially variable conditions. Aided by separation of ecological and evolutionary time scales, the identified effective dimensionless parameters reveal a simple threshold that predicts when adaptation at the range margin fails. Two observable parameters determine the threshold: i) the effective environmental gradient, which can be measured by the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment, and ii) the efficacy of selection relative to genetic drift. The theory predicts sharp range margins even in the absence of abrupt changes in the environment. Furthermore, it implies that gradual worsening of conditions across a species habitat may lead to a sudden range fragmentation, when adaptation to a wide span of conditions within a single species becomes impossible.",

    "abstract": "\\\"Candidatus Liberibacter africanus\\\" (Laf) has long been recognised as a causal agent of the devastating citrus disease huanglongbing (HLB) or citrus greening. This species is currently restricted to Africa, the Arabian Peninsula and some Indian Ocean islands and vectored by the African citrus psyllid, Trioza erytreae. Blotchy mottle on citrus leaves is characteristic of the disease.\\n\\nSomewhat similar symptoms in the Rutaceous tree Calodendrum capensis (Cape Chestnut) resulted in the discovery of Laf outside commercial citrus crops in South Africa. This was classed as a subspecies of Laf (capensis, hence LafC). In subsequent surveys of both commercial citrus crops and Calodendrum, both natural and ornamental specimens, LafC was not found in the citrus crop, nor has Laf been found in C. capensis. HLB was reported from Madagascar in 1968 but no sequences from this source have so far been published.\\n\\nUntil fairly recently, only the reference 16S rRNA gene sequences of Laf (L22533) and LafC (AF137368) had been deposited in GenBank. Both of these reference sequences contain a number of unresolved nucleotides. Resolving these nucleotide positions by aligning against more recently available sequences, it becomes evident that these unresolved positions represent one percentage point difference in similarity between Laf and LafC. The originally reported 97.4% similarity is therefore incorrect based on this new information. Recalculating the similarity on the full length 16S rDNA sequence results in 99.54% similarity, a value too high to justify a subspecies status. LafC should therefore be reduced to that of a haplotype of Laf.\\n\\nFurther, the six 16S rRNA gene sequences currently available in GenBank identified as the species Laf separate into 2 haplotype groups. The 3 haplotypes of Laf are therefore LafA designated as the first accession sequenced (L22533), LafC for the former capensis subspecies and to recognise the prior use of this term, and LafB for the third haplotype not previously recognised. Thus the cryptic presence of 3 haplotypes is revealed by this review of the Laf 16S rDNA sequences.",
