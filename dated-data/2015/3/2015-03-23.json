    "abstract": "BackgroundHox gene collinearity relates the sequential location of Hox genes in the 3 to 5 direction on the chromosome with the linear arrangement of the body elements along the anterior-posterior (A/P) axis of bilaterian embryos. This spatial Hox gene collinearity has been almost universally respected in diverse organisms like worms, insects or vertebrates. It is therefore surprising that the above well established collinearity rule is violated in the case of Echinoderms. No explanation of this violation is apparent. Here a hypothesis is put forward which provides a cue to understand the abnormal serial gene location in the sea urchin disorganized Hox cluster.\\n\\nResultsBilateral symmetry along the A/P embryo axis is established at the very early stages of ontogeny of the sea urchin. For the subsequent developmental stages, rotational symmetry emerges in the vestibula larva. In analogy to the linear A/P case, the circular topology of modules might be a reflection of the architectural restructuring of the Hox loci where the 3 and 5 ends of the Hox cluster approach each other so that a closed contour of the chromatin fiber is formed. At a later stage, the break and opening of the cluster contour at the level of Hox4 combined with the rotational symmetry leads to the observed Hox gene sequence that violates the standard 3 to 5 collinearity.\\n\\nConclusionThe unusual gene series manifests the congruence of Hox gene sequence in the cluster with the circular arrangement of the sea urchin primary podia. Accordingly, the Hox sequence after the break at Hox4 is not a violation but an extension of Hox gene collinearity to animals with rotational symmetry.",

    "abstract": "Organisms have different circuitries that allow converting signal molecule levels to changes in gene expression. An important challenge in synthetic biology involves the de novo design of RNA modules enabling dynamic signal processing in live cells. This requires a scalable methodology for sensing, transmission, and actuation, which could be assembled into larger signaling networks. Here, we present a biochemical strategy to design RNA-mediated signal transduction cascades able to sense small molecules and small RNAs. We design switchable functional RNA domains by using strand-displacement techniques. We experimentally characterize the molecular mechanism underlying our synthetic RNA signaling cascades, show the ability to regulate gene expression with transduced RNA signals, and describe the signal processing response of our systems to periodic forcing in single live cells. The engineered systems integrate RNA-RNA interaction with available ribozyme and aptamer elements, providing new ways to engineer arbitrary complex gene circuits.",

    "abstract": "In finite populations, an allele disappears or reaches fixation due to two main forces, selection and drift. Selection is generally thought to accelerate the process: a selected mutation will reach fixation faster than a neutral one, and a disadvantageous one will quickly disappear from the population. We show that even in simple diploid populations, this is often not true. Dominance and recessivity unexpectedly slow down the evolutionary process for weakly selected alleles. In particular, slightly advantageous dominant and mildly deleterious recessive mutations reach fixation more slowly than neutral ones. This phenomenon determines genetic signatures opposite to those expected under strong selection, such as increased instead of decreased genetic diversity around the selected site. Furthermore, we characterize a new phenomenon: mildly deleterious recessive alleles, thought to represent the vast majority of newly arising mutations, survive in a population longer than neutral ones, before getting lost. Hence, natural selection is less effective than previously thought in getting rid rapidly of slightly negative mutations, contributing their observed persistence in present populations. Consequently, low frequency slightly deleterious mutations are on average older than neutral ones.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryA common assumption among geneticists is that neutral alleles survive longer in a population than selected variants: negative selection would rapidly lead to the extinction of deleterious mutations, while advantageous alleles under positive selection will spread in the population till fixation. Here we show that unless an allele is perfectly codominant, these assumptions are often incorrect. Under weak selection, even in the simplest models, incomplete dominance and recessivity are sufficient to determine slower fixation and extinction times than for a neutral allele. These seemingly paradoxical results suggest that mildly deleterious mutations accumulate at the population level, and that nearly neutral mutations behave very differently from strongly selected ones. Furthermore, a fraction of selected regions would show opposite patterns for many standard statistics used to detect genomic signatures of positive selection, remaining virtually impossible to detect.",
