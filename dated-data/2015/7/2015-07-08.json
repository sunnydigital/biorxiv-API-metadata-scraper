    "abstract": "SummaryRecent technological advancements enable measuring the binding of a transcription factor to thousands of DNA sequences, in order to infer its binding preferences. High-throughput-SELEX measures protein-DNA binding by deep sequencing over several cycles of enrichment. We devised a new algorithm called HTS-IBIS for the inference task. HTS-IBIS corrects for technological biases, selects the cycle and k, and builds a motif starting from a consensus k-mer in that cycle. In large scale tests, HTS-IBIS outperformed the extant automatic algorithm for the motif finding task on both in vitro and in vivo binding prediction.\\n\\nAvailabilityHTS-IBIS is available on acgt.cs.tau.ac.il/HTS-IBIS.\\n\\nContactrshamir@tau.ac.il",

    "abstract": "The ever-growing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed widespread pleiotropy. To exploit this, various methods which consider variant association with multiple traits jointly have been developed. However, most effort has been put on improving discovery power: how to replicate and interpret these discovered pleiotropic loci using multivariate methods has yet to be discussed fully. Using only multiple publicly available single-trait GWAS summary statistics, we develop a fast and flexible multi-trait framework that contains modules for (i) multi-trait genetic discovery, (ii) replication of locus pleiotropic profile, and (iii) multi-trait conditional analysis. The procedure is able to handle any level of sample overlap. As an empirical example, we discovered and replicated 23 novel pleiotropic loci for human anthropometry and evaluated their pleiotropic effects on other traits. By applying conditional multivariate analysis on the 23 loci, we discovered and replicated two additional multi-trait associated SNPs. Our results provide empirical evidence that multi-trait analysis allows detection of additional, replicable, highly pleiotropic genetic associations without genotyping additional individuals. The methods are implemented in a free and open source R package MultiABEL.\\n\\nAuthor summaryBy analyzing large-scale genomic data, geneticists have revealed widespread pleiotropy, i.e. single genetic variation can affect a wide range of complex traits. Methods have been developed to discover such genetic variants. However, we still lack insights into the relevant genetic architecture - What more can we learn from knowing the effects of these genetic variants?\\n\\nHere, we develop a fast and flexible statistical analysis procedure that includes discovery, replication, and interpretation of pleiotropic effects. The whole analysis pipeline only requires established genetic association study results. We also provide the mathematical theory behind the pleiotropic genetic effects testing.\\n\\nMost importantly, we show how a replication study can be essential to reveal new biology rather than solely increasing sample size in current genomic studies. For instance, we show that, using our proposed replication strategy, we can detect the difference in genetic effects between studies of different geographical origins.\\n\\nWe applied the method to the GIANT consortium anthropometric traits to discover new genetic associations, replicated in the UK Biobank, and provided important new insights into growth and obesity.\\n\\nOur pipeline is implemented in an open-source R package MultiABEL, sufficiently efficient that allows researchers to immediately apply on personal computers in minutes.",

    "abstract": "While eukaryotic and archaean genomes encode the histone fold domain, only eukaryotes encode the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. Core histones assemble into a hetero-octamer rather than the homo-tetramer of Archaea. Thus it was unexpected that core histone \\\"doublets\\\" were identified in the cytoplasmic replication factories of the Marseilleviridae (MV), one family of Nucleo-Cytoplasmic Large DNA Viruses (NCLDV). Here we analyze the core histone doublet genes from all known Marseilleviridae genomes and show that they encode obligate H2B-H2A and H4-H3 dimers of likely proto-eukaryotic origin. Each MV core histone moiety forms a sister clade to a eukaryotic core histone clade inclusive of canonical core histone paralogs, suggesting that MV core histone moieties diverged prior to eukaryotic neofunctionalizations associated with paired linear chromosomes and variant histone octamer assembly. We also show that all MV genomes encode a eukaryote-like DNA topoisomerase II enzyme that forms a clade that is sister to the eukaryotic clade. As DNA topo II influences histone deposition and chromatin compaction and is the second most abundant nuclear protein after histones, we suggest MV genes underlie a proto-chromatinized replisome that diverged prior to diversification of eukaryotic core histone variants. Thus, combined domain architecture and phylogenomic analyses suggest that a primitive origin for MV chromatin genes is a more parsimonious explanation than horizontal gene transfers + gene fusions + long-branch attraction constrained to each core histone clade. These results imply that core histones were utilized ancestrally in viral DNA compaction, protection from host endonucleases, and/or other unknown processes associated with NCLDV-like progenitors.",

    "abstract": "Populations facing novel environments can persist by adapting. In nature, the ability to adapt and persist will depend on interactions between coexisting individuals. Here we use an adaptive dynamic model to assess how the potential for evolutionary rescue is affected by intra- and interspecific competition. Intraspecific competition (negative density-dependence) lowers abundance, which decreases the supply rate of beneficial mutations, hindering evolutionary rescue. On the other hand, interspecific competition can aid evolutionary rescue when it speeds adaptation by increasing the strength of selection. Our results clarify this point and give an additional requirement: competition must increase selection pressure enough to overcome the negative effect of reduced abundance. We therefore expect evolutionary rescue to be most likely in communities which facilitate rapid niche displacement. Our model, which aligns to previous quantitative and population genetic models in the absence of competition, provides a first analysis of when competitors should help or hinder evolutionary rescue.",

    "abstract": "African Pygmies practicing a mobile hunter-gatherer lifestyle are phenotypically and genetically diverged from other anatomically modern humans, and they likely experienced strong selective pressures due to their unique lifestyle in the Central African rainforest. To identify genomic targets of adaptation, we sequenced the genomes of four Biaka Pygmies from the Central African Republic and jointly analyzed these data with the genome sequences of three Baka Pygmies from Cameroon and nine Yoruba famers. To account for the complex demographic history of these populations that includes both isolation and gene flow, we fit models using the joint allele frequency spectrum and validated them using independent approaches. Our two best-fit models both suggest ancient divergence between the ancestors of the farmers and Pygmies, 90,000 or 150,000 years ago. We also find that bi-directional asymmetric gene-flow is statistically better supported than a single pulse of unidirectional gene flow from farmers to Pygmies, as previously suggested. We then applied complementary statistics to scan the genome for evidence of selective sweeps and polygenic selection. We found that conventional statistical outlier approaches were biased toward identifying candidates in regions of high mutation or low recombination rate. To avoid this bias, we assigned P-values for candidates using whole-genome simulations incorporating demography and variation in both recombination and mutation rates. We found that genes and gene sets involved in muscle development, bone synthesis, immunity, reproduction, cell signaling and development, and energy metabolism are likely to be targets of positive natural selection in Western African Pygmies or their recent ancestors.",
