    "abstract": "Changes in gene expression are thought to regulate the differentiation process intrinsically through complex epigenetic mechanisms. In fundamental terms, however, this assumed regulation refers only to the intricate propagation of changes in gene expression or else leads to logical inconsistencies. The evolution and self-regulatory dynamics of individuated multicellularity also lack a unified and falsifiable description. To fill this gap, I computationally analyzed publicly available high-throughput data of histone H3 post-translational modifications and mRNA abundance for different Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, and Drosophila melanogaster cell-type/developmental-periods samples. My analysis of genomic regions adjacent to transcription start sites generated a profile from pairwise partial correlations between histone modifications controlling for the respective mRNA levels for each cell-type/developmental-period dataset. I found that these profiles, while explicitly uncorrelated to transcript abundance by construction, associate strongly with cell differentiation states. This association is not expected if cell differentiation is, in effect, regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. Based on these results, I propose a falsifiable theory of individuated multicellularity, which relies on the synergistic coupling across the extracellular space of two stochastically independent \\\"self-organizing\\\" systems constraining histone modification states at the same sites. This theory describes how the multicellular individual--understood as an intrinsic, higher-order constraint--emerges from proliferating undifferentiated cells, and may explain the intrinsic regulation of gene transcriptional changes during cell differentiation and the evolution of individuated multicellular organisms.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGenomic prediction aims to leverage genome-wide genetic data towards better disease diagnostics and risk scores. We have previously published a genomic risk score (GRS) for celiac disease (CD), a common and highly heritable autoimmune disease, which differentiates between CD cases and population-based controls at a clinically-relevant predictive level, improving upon other gene-based approaches. HLA risk haplotypes, particularly HLA-DQ2.5, are necessary but not sufficient for CD, with at least one HLA risk haplotype present in up to half of most Caucasian populations. Here, we assess a genomic prediction strategy that specifically targets this common genetic susceptibility subtype, utilizing a supervised learning procedure for CD that leverages known HLA-DQ2.5 risk.\\n\\nMethodsUsing L1/L2-regularized support-vector machines trained on large European case-control datasets, we constructed novel CD GRSs specific to individuals with HLA-DQ2.5 risk haplotypes (GRS-DQ2.5) and compared them with the predictive power of the existing CD GRS (GRS14) as well as two haplotype-based approaches, externally validating the results in a North American case-control study.\\n\\nResultsConsistent with previous observations, both the existing GRS14 and the GRS-DQ2.5 had better predictive performance than the HLA haplotype approaches. GRS-DQ2.5 models, based on directly genotyped or imputed markers, achieved similar levels of predictive performance (AUC = 0.718--0.73), which were substantially higher than those obtained from the DQ2.5 zygosity alone (AUC = 0.558), the HLA risk haplotype method (AUC = 0.634), or the generic GRS14 (AUC = 0.679). In a screening model of at-risk individuals, the GRS-DQ2.5 lowered the number of unnecessary follow-up tests for CD across most sensitivity levels. Relative to a baseline implicating all DQ2.5-positive individuals for follow-up, the GRS-DQ2.5 resulted in a net saving of 2.2 unnecessary follow-up tests for each justified test while still capturing 90% of DQ2.5-positive CD cases.\\n\\nConclusionsGenomic risk scores for CD that target genetically at-risk sub-groups improve predictive performance beyond traditional approaches and may represent a useful strategy for prioritizing individuals at increase risk of disease, thus potentially reducing unnecessary follow-up diagnostic tests.",

    "abstract": "We recently presented an estimate of the number of mutually discriminable olfactory stimuli at one trillion (1). Subjects were asked to sniff mixtures of molecules with increasing component overlap selected from a panel of 128 isointense structurally and perceptually diverse monomolecular odorants (2). We considered stimulus pairs discriminable when the majority of subjects could significantly discriminate them at p=0.05, a conventional statistical threshold given our sample size. From these empirical data, we estimated that human discriminative capacity exceeds one trillion olfactory stimuli. Several readers have pointed out that such extrapolations are sensitive to underlying assumptions about the chosen significance threshold (3) and the dimensionality of olfaction (4). It is important to note that any exponential function will be sensitive in this way, and the goal of our model was not to identify the exact number of discriminable olfactory stimuli, or even the exact mathematical bounds, but an estimate of the order of magnitude of human discriminatory power across a population of human subjects. This was not clearly stated in our paper, and we agree that contradictory references to a \\\"lower limit\\\" and an \\\"upper bound\\\" were confusing. The central argument in (4) is that our estimation method assumes that the dimensionality of olfactory space is large. We agree that the high-dimensional nature of olfaction is indeed an assumption, and we should have stated this explicitly in our paper (1). Even if we follow this logic of the models presented in (4), purely geometrical calculations show that our results hold if the dimensionality of olfactory representations is D[&ge;]25. The dimensionality of olfaction is a question of interest to everyone, and while we do not know for sure, all available evidence suggests that olfaction is a high-dimensional sense. The olfactory system is wired to keep information from the ~400 odorant receptors strictly separated, so it is plausible that olfaction operates at least in 400-dimensional space. This is an important topic of discussion in olfaction, and we welcome continued debate of the dimensionality of smell and how this impacts human olfactory perception.",

    "abstract": "The brain matures with large quantitative changes in anatomy and function. Graph analysis of EEG has previously revealed increased connectivity between distant brain areas and a decrease in randomness and increased integration in the brain network with concurrent increased modularity. Comparisons of graph parameters across age groups, however, may be confounded with network degree distributions. Here, we analyzed graph parameters from minimum spanning tree (MST) graphs. MST graphs are constructed by selecting only the strongest available connections avoiding loops resulting in a backbone graph that is thought reflect the major qualitative properties of connectivity while allowing a better comparison across age groups by avoiding the degree distribution confound. EEG was recorded in a large (N=1500) population-based sample aged 5 to 71 years. Connectivity was assessed using Phase Lag Index to reduce effects of volume conduction. As previously reported, connectivity increased from childhood to adolescence, continuing to grow nonsignificantly into adulthood decreasing only after ~30 years of age. Leaf number, degree, degree correlation, maximum centrality from the MST graph indicated a pattern of increased integration and decreased randomness from childhood into early adulthood. The observed development in network topology suggested that maturation at the neuronal level is aimed to increase connectivity as well as increase integration of the brain network. We confirm that brain network connectivity shows quantitative changes across the life span, and additionally demonstrate parallel qualitative changes in the connectivity pattern.",

Three genome sequences have recently been made available for the blind mole-rat (Nannospalax galili; Spalacidae; Muroidea)1, and the convergently evolved naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber; Heterocephalidae; Ctenohystrica)2 and its close relative the Damaraland mole-rat (Fukomys damarensis; Bathyergidae; Ctenohystrica)3. In their genome paper1, Fang et al. evaluated convergent molecular evolution related to the subterranean life-style between the naked mole-rat and the blind mole-rat. One particularly striking result was the strong signal for amino acid convergence detected in the circadian rhythm CLOCK gene. Here I show that this unexpected result is erroneous because it is based on the use of the wrong sequence for the naked mole-rat, which has been mistakenly replaced by a sequence from a blind mole-rat. When the correct sequence is used, the evidence for convergent molecular evolution in this gene appears very limited.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic drug resistance spreads through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) via bacterial conjugation in unicellular populations of bacteria. Consequently, the efficiency of antibiotics is limited and the expected \\\"grace period\\\" of novel antibiotics is typically quite short. One of the mechanisms that allow the accelerated adaptation of bacteria to antibiotics is bacterial conjugation. However, bacterial conjugation is regulated by several biological factors, with one of the most important ones being repression and derepression.\\n\\nIn recent work, we have studied the effects that repression and de-repression on the mutation-selection balance of an HGT-enabled bacterial population in a static environment. Two of our main findings were that conjugation has a deleterious effect on the mean fitness of the population and that repression is expected to allow a restoration of the fitness cost due to plasmid hosting.\\n\\nHere, we consider the effect that conjugation-mediated HGT has on the speed of adaptation in a dynamic environment and the effect that repression will have on the dynamics of antibiotic drug resistance. We find that, the effect of repression is dynamic in its possible outcome, that a conjugators to non-conjugators phase transition exists in a dynamic landscape as we have previously found for a static landscape and we quantify the time required for a unicellular population to adapt to a new antibiotic in a periodically changing fitness landscape. Our results also confirmed that HGT accelerates adaptation for a population of prokaryotes which agrees with current knowledge, that HGT rates increase when a population is put under stress.",

Recently there has been debate over whether an aggressive (i.e. high dose) or more moderate (i.e. lower dose) treatment of individuals will most limit the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria. Here we demonstrate how one can understand and resolve these apparently contradictory conclusions. We show that a key determinant of which treatment strategy will perform best at the individual level is the extent of effective competition between resistant and sensitive pathogens within a host. We extend our analysis to the community level, exploring the spectrum between strict inter-strain competition and strain independence. From this perspective as well, we find that the magnitude of effective competition between resistant and sensitive strains determines whether an aggressive approach or moderate approach minimizes the burden of resistance in the population.",

We find that large chromosome segments are more likely to interact in areas that have high transcription rate or Pol II occupancy. Additionally, we find that groups of genes with similar transcription rates or similar Pol II occupancy are more likely to have higher numbers of chromosomal interactions than groups of random genes. We hypothesize that transcription localization occurs around sets of genes with similar transcription rates, and more often around genes that are highly transcribed, in order to produce more efficient transcription.

With the improved mRNA measurements, the variation attributable to translational control in exponentially growing yeast was less than previously reported, and most of this variation could be predicted with a simple model that considered mRNA abundance, upstream open reading frames, cap-proximal structure and nucleotide composition, and lengths of the coding and 5-untranslated regions.
