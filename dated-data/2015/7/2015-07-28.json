    "abstract": "Predicting the course of evolution is critical for solving current biomedical challenges such as cancer and the evolution of drug resistant pathogens. One approach to studying evolutionary predictability is to observe repeated, independent evolutionary trajectories of similar organisms under similar selection pressures in order to empirically characterize this adaptive fitness landscape. As this approach is infeasible for many natural systems, a number of recent studies have attempted to gain insight into the adaptive fitness landscape by testing the plausibility of different orders of appearance for a specific set of adaptive mutations in a single adaptive trajectory. While this approach is technically feasible for systems with very few available adaptive mutations, the usefulness of this approach for predicting evolution in situations with highly polygenic adaptation is unknown. It is also unclear whether the presence of stable adaptive polymorphisms can influence the predictability of evolution as measured by these methods. In this work, we simulate adaptive evolution under Fishers geometric model to study evolutionary predictability. Remarkably, we find that the predictability estimated by these methods are anti-correlated, and that the presence of stable adaptive polymorphisms can both qualitatively and quantitatively change the predictability of evolution.",

    "abstract": "Analyses of living and fossil taxa are crucial for understanding changes in biodiversity through time. The Total Evidence method allows living and fossil taxa to be combined in phylogenies, by using molecular data for living taxa and morphological data for both living and fossil taxa. With this method, substantial overlap of morphological data among living and fossil taxa is crucial for accurately inferring topology. However, although molecular data for living species is widely available, scientists using and generating morphological data mainly focus on fossils. Therefore, there is a gap in our knowledge of neontological morphological data even in well-studied groups such as mammals.\\n\\nWe investigated the amount of morphological (cladistic) data available for living mammals and how this data was phylogenetically distributed across orders. 22 of 28 mammalian orders have <25% species with available morphological data; this has implications for the accurate placement of fossil taxa, although the issue is less pronounced at higher taxonomic levels. In most orders, species with available data are randomly distributed across the phylogeny, which may reduce the impact of the problem. We suggest that increased morphological data collection efforts for living taxa are needed to produce accurate Total Evidence phylogenies.",

Assembling complete bacterial and small eukaryotic genomes is now possible, but the final step of circularizing sequences remains unsolved. Here we present Circlator, the first tool to automate assembly circularization and produce accurate linear rep-resentations of circular sequences. Using Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore data, Circlator correctly circularized 26 of 27 circularizable sequences, comprising 11 chromosomes and 12 plasmids from bacteria, the apicoplast and mitochondrion of Plasmodium falciparum and a human mitochondrion.

    "abstract": "As a chromosome is sliced into pieces by recombination after entering an admixed population, ancestral tracks of chromosomes are shortened with the pasting of generations. The length distribution of ancestral tracks reflects information of recombination and thus can be used to infer the histories of admixed populations. Previous studies have shown that inference based on ancestral tracks is powerful in recovering the histories of admixed populations. However, population histories are always complex, and previous studies only deduced the length distribution of ancestral tracks under very simple admixture models. The deduction of length distribution of ancestral tracks under a more general model will greatly elevate the power in inferring population histories. Here we first deduced the length distribution of ancestral tracks under a general model in an admixed population, and proposed general principles in parameter estimation and model selection with the length distribution. Next, we focused on studying the length distribution of ancestral tracks and its applications under three typical admixture models, which were all special cases of our general model. Extensive simulations showed that the length distribution of ancestral tracks was well predicted by our theoretical models. We further developed a new method based on the length distribution of ancestral tracks and good performance was observed when it was applied in inferring population histories under the three typical models. Notably, our method was insensitive to demographic history, sample size and threshold to discard short tracks. Finally, we applied our method in African Americans and Mexicans from the HapMap dataset, and several South Asian populations from the Human Genome Diversity Project dataset. The results showed that the histories of African Americans and Mexicans matched the historical records well, and the population admixture history of South Asians was very complex and could be traced back to around 100 generations ago.",

We also demonstrate the speed and accuracy of our method on seven families of ray-finned fishes (Actinopterygii). 4. Crowdsourcing will enable the collection of morphological data across vast radiations of organisms, and can facilitate richer inference on the macroevolutionary processes that shape phenotypic diversity across the tree of life.",

    "abstract": "The Cas9/CRISPR system is a powerful tool for studying gene function. Here we describe a method that allows temporal control of Cas9/CRISPER activity based on conditional Cas9 destabilization. We demonstrate that fusing an FKBP12-derived destabilizing domain to Cas9 (DD-CAS9) enables conditional Cas9 expression in vitro in the presence of an FKBP12 synthetic ligand and temporal control of gene-editing. Further, we show that this strategy can be easily adapted to co-express, from the same promoter, DD-Cas9 with any other gene of interest, without the latter being co-modulated. In particular, when co-expressed with inducible Cre-ERT2, our system enables parallel, independent manipulation of alleles targeted by Cas9 and traditional recombinase with single-cell specificity. We anticipate this platform will be used for the systematic identification of essential genes and the interrogation of genes functional interactions.",

    "abstract": "Large magnetic nanoparticles (over 25 nm diameter) are a valuable commodity but remain difficult to synthesize using traditional chemical synthesis methods. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTBs) have evolved mechanisms to produce monodisperse, protected magnetic nanostructures within organelles (magnetosomes). Genomic diversity of MTB species result in unique particle properties that vary in shape and size ranging from 30 nm to 150 nm based on the genetic background. Culturing and engineering MTBs for the production of magnetic nanoparticles carries tremendous potential but is underdeveloped. This primarily because MTBs are difficult to culture and genetically manipulate, limitations that could be alleviated with adaptive evolution. We propose the magnetotrophic reactor, a novel bioreactor system for adaptively evolving MTBs for better growth and magnetosome production. This platform is projected to be superior to the traditional evolution methods since robust growth phenotypes can be selected for while maintaining selective pressure for magnetotaxis. We provide, herein, a quantitative basis for our platform including considerations of continuous evolution, sizing, and magnetic field pulsing. Our proposed fermentation process anticipates scalable production of 1 g/L per day of monodisperse magnetic nanoparticles to enable industrial applications.",
