    "abstract": "BackgroundSearching for similar compounds in a database is the most important process for in-silico drug screening. Since a query compound is an important starting point for the new drug, a query holder, who is afraid of the query being monitored by the database server, usually downloads all the records in the database and uses them in a closed network. However, a serious dilemma arises when the database holder also wants to output no information except for the search results, and such a dilemma prevents the use of many important data resources.\\n\\nResultsIn order to overcome this dilemma, we developed a novel cryptographic protocol that enables database searching while keeping both the query holders privacy and database holders privacy. Generally, the application of cryptographic techniques to practical problems is difficult because versatile techniques are computationally expensive while computationally inexpensive techniques can perform only trivial computation tasks. In this study, our protocol is successfully built only from an additive-homomorphic cryptosystem, which allows only addition performed on encrypted values but is computationally efficient compared with versatile techniques such as general purpose multi-party computation. In an experiment searching ChEMBL, which consists of more than 1,200,000 compounds, the proposed method was 36,900 times faster in CPU time and 12,000 times as efficient in communication size compared with general purpose multi-party computation.\\n\\nConclusionWe proposed a novel privacy-preserving protocol for searching chemical compound databases. The proposed method, easily scaling for large-scale databases, may help to accelerate drug discovery research by making full use of unused but valuable data that includes sensitive information.",

    "abstract": "One of surprising recent discoveries in biology is that the gene and protein expression profiles in cells with identical genetic and environmental makeup can exhibit large variability. The nature and the significance of this variability had been posed as one of the current fundamental questions of biology. In this letter, we argue that the observed variability in cellular gene and protein expression can be understood as an outcome of homeostatic regulation mechanisms controlling the gene and protein expression profiles.",

    "abstract": "Ever since the accidental discovery of Wingless [Sharma R.P., Drosophila information service, 1973, 50, p 134], research in the field of Wnt signaling pathway has taken significant strides in wet lab experiments and various cancer clinical trials augmented by recent developments in advanced computational modeling of the pathway. Information rich gene expression profiles reveal various aspects of the signaling pathway at work and help in studying different issues simultaneously. Hitherto, not many computational studies exist which incorporate the simultaneous study of these issues. This manuscript is an endeavour to * explore the strength of contributing factors in the signaling pathway, * analyze the existing causal relations among the inter/extracellular factors effecting the pathway based on prior biological knowledge and * investigate the deviations in fold changes in the recently found prevalence of psychophysical laws working in the pathway. To achieve this goal, local and global sensitivity analysis is conducted on the (non)linear responses between the factors obtained from static and time series expression profiles using the density (Hilbert-Schmidt Information Criterion) and variance (Sobol) based sensitivity indices. The results show the superiority of the density based indices in comparison to the use of variance based indices mainly due to the former's employment of distance measures using the kernel trick via Reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that capture nonlinear relations among various intra/extracellular factors of the pathway in a higher dimensional space. In time series data, using these indices it is now possible to observe where in time, which factors get influenced & contribute to the pathway, as changes in concentration of the other factors are made. This synergy of prior biological knowledge, sensitivity analysis and representations in higher dimensional spaces can facilitate in time based administration of target therapeutic drugs and reveal hidden biological information within colorectal cancer samples.

    "abstract": "Currently quantitative RNA-Seq methods are pushed to work with increasingly small starting amounts of RNA that require amplification. However, it is unclear how much noise or bias amplification introduces and how this effects precision and accuracy of RNA quantification. To assess the effects of amplification, reads that originated from the same RNA molecule (PCR-duplicates) need to be identified. Computationally, read duplicates are defined via their mapping position, which does not distinguish PCR- from natural duplicates and hence it is unclear how to treat duplicate reads.\\n\\nHere, we generate and analyse RNA-seq datasets prepared using three different protocols (Smart-Seq, TruSeq and UMI-seq). We find that a large fraction of computationally identified read duplicates can be explained by sampling and fragmentation bias. Consequently, the computational removal of duplicates does not improve accuracy, power or FDR, but can actually worsen them. Even when duplicates are experimentally identified by unique molecular identifiers (UMIs), power and FDR are only mildly improved. However, the pooling of samples as made possible by the early barcoding of the UMI-protocol leads to an appreciable increase in the power to detect differentially expressed genes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRepeated clusters of ribosomal genes whose activity results in the nucleolus formation are extremely important in multicellular organism genome. Despite the extensive exploration into vertebrate genomes, in many model objects the ribosomal cluster structure is still underinvestigated. So far, complete description for primary structure of avian ribosomal cluster has not been reported.\\n\\nResultsThis work represents the first successful assembly of complete chicken ribosome cluster sequence. The sequence was deposited to GenBank under accession number KT445934. The total cluster size from pre-rRNA transcriptional start site to the 3' end of 3ETS amounted to 11444 bp. 18S rRNA gene size is 1823 base pairs, 5.8S rRNA - 157 bp, 28S rRNA - 4443 bp. The 5  ETS spacer core size is 1839 bp, 3ETS - about 350 bp., ITS1 - 2099 bp, and ITS2 - 733 bp. The assembly was validated through in situ fluorescent hybridization (FISH) analysis on metaphase chromosomes of chicken. ITS1 and ITS2 spacer sequences have been found to have high GC pair content and form secondary structures featuring high melting temperature.\\n\\nConclusionsDecoding of the chicken rRNA gene cluster sequence extends the use of birds as a model object for exploration into nucleolus organizer region (NOR) regulation and nucleolus functions, e.g. in ontogenesis. This data might also be useful to address certain problems of population and evolutionary genetics.",

    "abstract": "To efficiently learn from feedback, cortical networks need to update synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy. An effective and well-known algorithm for computing such changes in synaptic weights is the error back-propagation algorithm. However, in the back-propagation algorithm, the change in synaptic weights is a complex function of weights and activities of neurons not directly connected with the synapse being modified, whereas the changes in biological synapses are determined only by the activity of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons. Several models have been proposed that approximate the back-propagation algorithm with local synaptic plasticity, but these models require complex external control over the network or relatively complex plasticity rules. Here we show that a network developed in the predictive coding framework can efficiently perform supervised learning fully autonomously, employing only simple local Hebbian plasticity. Furthermore, for certain parameters, the weight change in the predictive coding model converges to that of the back-propagation algorithm. This suggests that it is possible for cortical networks with simple Hebbian synaptic plasticity to implement efficient learning algorithms in which synapses in areas on multiple levels of hierarchy are modified to minimize the error on the output.",

    "abstract": "DNA regulatory elements contain short motifs where transcription factors (TFs) can bind to modulate gene expression. Although the broad principles of TF regulation are well understood, the rules that dictate how combinatorial TF binding translates into transcriptional activity remain largely unknown. With the rapid advances in DNA synthesis and sequencing technologies and the continuing decline in the associated costs, high-throughput experiments can be performed to investigate the regulatory role of thousands of oligonucleotide sequences simultaneously. Nevertheless, designing high-throughput reporter assay experiments such as Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs) and similar methods remains challenging. We introduce MPRAnator, a set of tools that facilitate rapid design of MPRA experiments. With MPRA Motif design, a set of variables provides fine control of how motifs are placed into sequences therefore allowing the user to investigate the rules that govern TF occupancy. MPRA SNP design can be used to investigate the functional effects of single or combinations of SNPs at regulatory sequences. Finally, the Transmutation tool allows for the design of negative controls by permitting scrambling, reversing, complementing or introducing multiple random mutations in the input sequences or motifs.",
