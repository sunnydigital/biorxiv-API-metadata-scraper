    "abstract": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its sibling species S. paradoxus are known to inhabit temperate arboreal habitats across the globe. Despite their sympatric distribution in the wild, S. cerevisiae is predominantly associated with human fermentations. The apparent ecological differentiation of these species is particularly striking in Europe where S. paradoxus is abundant in forests and S. cerevisiae is abundant in vineyards. However, ecological differences may be confounded with geographic differences in species abundance. To compare the distribution and abundance of these two species we isolated Saccharomyces strains from over 1,200 samples taken from vineyard and forest habitats in Slovenia. We isolated numerous strains of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus as well as small number of S. kudriavzevii strains from both vineyard and forest environments. We find S. cerevisiae less abundant than S. paradoxus on oak trees within and outside the vineyard, but more abundant on grapevines and associated substrates. Analysis of the uncultured microbiome shows that both S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus are rare species in soil and bark samples, but can be much more common in grape must. In contrast to S. paradoxus, European strains of S. cerevisiae have acquired multiple traits thought to be important for life in the vineyard and dominance of wine fermentations. We conclude that S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus currently share both vineyard and non-vineyard habitats in Slovenia and we discuss factors relevant to their global distribution and relative abundance.",

    "abstract": "Entropy rising within normal hematopoiesis is the core idea of the proposed thermodynamical model of malignancy in leukemia. Mathematically its description is supposed to be similar to the Lorenz system of ordinary differential equations for simplified processes of heat flow in fluids. The model provides description of remission and relapse in leukemia as two hierarchical and qualitatively different states of normal hematopoiesis with their own phase spaces. Phase space transition is possible through pitchfork bifurcation, which is considered as the common symmetrical scenario for relapse, induced remission and spontaneous remission of leukemia. Cytopenia is regarded as an adaptive reaction of hematopoiesis to entropy increase caused by leukemia clone. The following hypotheses are formulated: a) Percentage of leukemia cells in marrow as criterion of remission or relapse is not necessarily constant but a variable value; b) Probability of getting remission depends upon normal hematopoiesis reaching bifurcation; c) Duration of remission depends upon eradication of leukemia cells in induction or consolidation therapies; d) Excessively high doses of chemotherapy in consolidation might induce relapse.",

    "abstract": "Because of its clonal evolution a tumor rarely contains multiple genomic alterations in the same pathway, as disrupting the pathway by one gene often is sufficient to confer the complete fitness advantage. As a result mutated genes display patterns of mutual exclusivity across tumors. The identification of such patterns have been exploited to detect cancer drivers. The complex problem of searching for mutual exclusivity across individuals has previously been solved by filtering the input data upfront, analyzing only genes mutated in numerous samples. These stringent filtering criteria come at the expense of missing rarely mutated driver genes. To overcome this problem, we present SSA.ME, a network-based method to detect mutually exclusive genes across tumors that does not depend on stringent filtering. Analyzing the TCGA breast cancer dataset illustrates the added value of SSA.ME: despite not using mutational frequency based-prefiltering, well-known recurrently mutated drivers could still be highly prioritized. In addition, we prioritized several genes that displayed mutual exclusivity and pathway connectivity with well-known drivers, but that were rarely mutated. We expect the proposed framework to be applicable to other complex biological problems because of its capability to process large datasets in polynomial time and its intuitive implementation.",

    "abstract": "Sexual reproduction is a trait shared by all complex life, but explaining its origin and evolution remains a major theoretical challenge. Virtually all theoretical work on the evolution of sex has focused on the benefits of reciprocal recombination among nuclear genes, paying little attention to the dynamics of mitochondrial genes. Here I develop a mathematical model to study the evolution of alleles inducing cell fusion in an ancestral population of clonal proto-eukaryotes. Mitochondrial mixing masks the detrimental effects of faulty organelles and drives the evolution of sexual cell fusion despite the declining long-term population fitness. Cell-fusion alleles fix under negative epistatic interactions between mitochondrial mutations and strong purifying selection, low mutation load and weak mitochondrial-nuclear associations. I argue that similar conditions could have been maintained throughout the eukaryogenesis, favoring the evolution of sexual cell fusion and meiotic recombination without compromising the stability of the emerging complex cell.",

    "abstract": "Summary: Visualizing genomic data in chromosomal context can help detecting errors in data generation or analysis and can suggest new hypotheses to be tested. Here we report a new tool for displaying large and diverse genomic data in idiograms of one or multiple chromosomes. The package is implemented in R so that visualization can be easily integrated with its numerous packages for processing genomic data. It supports simultaneous visualization of multiples tracks of data, each of potentially different nature. Large genomic regions such as QTLs or synteny tracts may be shown along histograms of number of genes, genetic variants, or any other type of genomic element. Tracks can also contain values for continuous or categorical variables and the user can choose among points, points connected by lines, line segments, barplots or histograms for representing data. chromPlot reads data from tables in BED format which are imported in R using its builtin functions. The information necessary to draw chromosomes for mouse and human is included with the package. Chromosomes for other organisms are downloaded automatically from the Ensembl website or can be provided by the user. We present common use cases here, and a full tutorial is included as the packages's vignette.\\n\\nAvailability: chromPlot is distributed under a GLP2 licence at Genomed Lab: http://genomed.med.uchile.cl.\\n\\nContact: raverdugo@u.uchile.cl",

    "abstract": "With the advent of next generation high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies, omics experiments have become the mainstay for studying diverse biological effects on a genome wide scale. ChIP-seq is the omics technique that enables genome wide localization of transcription factor binding or epigenetic modification events. Since the inception of ChIP-seq in 2007, many methods have been developed to infer ChIP target binding loci from the resultant reads after mapping them to a reference genome. However, interpreting these data has proven challenging, and as such these algorithms have several shortcomings, including susceptibility to false positives due to artifactual peaks, poor localization of binding sites, and the requirement for a total DNA input control which increases the cost of performing these experiments. We present Ritornello, a new approach with roots in digital signal processing (DSP) that addresses all of these problems. We show that Ritornello generally performs equally or better than the peak callers tested and recommended by the ENCODE consortium, but in contrast, Ritornello does not require a matched total DNA input control to avoid false positives, effectively decreasing the sequencing cost to perform ChIP-seq.",

    "abstract": "A symptom of the need for greater reproducibility in scientific practice is the \\\"decline effect,\\\" the fact that the size of many experimental effects decline with subsequent study or fail to replicate entirely. A simple way to combat this problem is for scientists to more routinely use confidence intervals (CIs) in their work. CIs provide frequentist bounds on the true size of an effect and can reveal when a statistically significant effect is possibly too small to be reliable or when a large effect might have been missed due to insufficient statistical power. CIs are often lacking in psychophysiological reports, likely due to the large number of dependent variables, which complicates deriving and visualizing CIs. In this article, I explain the value of CIs and show how to compute them for analyses involving multiple variables in various ways that adjust the intervals for the greater uncertainty induced by multiple statistical comparisons. The methods are illustrated using a basic visual oddball event-related potential (ERP) dataset and freely available Matlab software.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the causes of cis-regulatory variation is a long-standing aim in evolutionary biology. Although cis-regulatory variation has long been considered important for adaptation, we still have a limited understanding of the selective importance and genomic determinants of standing cis-regulatory variation. To address these questions, we studied the prevalence, genomic determinants and selective forces shaping cis-regulatory variation in the outcrossing plant Capsella grandiflora. We first identified a set of 1,010 genes with common cis-regulatory variation using analyses of allele-specific expression (ASE). Population genomic analyses of whole-genome sequences from 32 individuals showed that genes with common cis-regulatory variation are 1) under weaker purifying selection and 2) undergo less frequent positive selection than other genes. We further identified genomic determinants of cis-regulatory variation. Gene-body methylation (gbM) was a major factor constraining cis-regulatory variation, whereas presence of nearby TEs and tissue specificity of expression increased the odds of ASE. Our results suggest that most common cis-regulatory variation in C. grandiflora is under weak purifying selection, and that gene-specific functional constraints are more important for the maintenance of cis-regulatory variation than genome-scale variation in the intensity of selection. Our results agree with previous findings that suggest TE silencing affects nearby gene expression, and provide novel evidence for a link between gbM and cis-regulatory constraint, possibly reflecting greater dosage-sensitivity of body-methylated genes. Given the extensive conservation of gene-body methylation in flowering plants, this suggests that gene-body methylation could be an important predictor of cis-regulatory variation in a wide range of plant species.",

    "abstract": "The ability to perform remote, in situ sequencing and diagnostics has been a long-sought goal for point-of-care medicine and portable DNA/RNA measurements. This technological advancement extends to missions beyond Earth as well, both for crew health and astrobiology applications. However, most commercially available sequencing technologies are ill-suited for space flight for a variety of reasons, including excessive volume and mass, and insufficient ruggedization for spaceflight. Portable and lightweight nanopore-based sequencers, which analyze nucleic acids electrochemically, are inherently much better suited to spaceflight, and could potentially be incorporated into future missions with only minimal modification. As a first step toward evaluating the performance of nanopore sequencers in a microgravity environment, we tested the Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION in a parabolic flight simulator to examine the effect of reduced gravity on DNA sequencing. The instrument successfully generated three reads, averaging 2,371 bases. However, the median current was shifted across all reads and the error profiles changed compared with operation of the sequencer on the ground, indicating that distinct computational methods may be needed for such data. We evaluated existing methods and propose two new methods; the first new method is based on a wave-fingerprint method similar to that of the Shazam model for matching periodicity information in music, and the second is based on entropy signal mapping. These tools provide a unique opportunity for nucleic acid sequencing in reduced gravity environments. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from the parabolic flight as they would apply to performing DNA sequencing with the MinION aboard the International Space Station.",
