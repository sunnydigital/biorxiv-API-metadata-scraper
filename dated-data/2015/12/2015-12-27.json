    "abstract": "Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-Seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-Seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, gene expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.",

    "abstract": "In northern Guinea, we sighted two groups of Sousa teuszii (n=25; n=40 dolphins) off the Tristao Islands during exploratory small-boat surveys in 2011-12. Based on these and recent (2013) observations in the contiguous Rio Nunez estuary, we propose a single  Guineas stock, combining the former  Rio do Jeba-Bijagos and South Guinea stocks. Significant mortality of S. teuszii from fisheries interactions is widely recognised however not quantifiable as monitoring effort is sporadic. In Guinea, catches were documented in 2002 (n=1) and in 2011-12 (n=5). Landed specimens were recorded in Cameroon (n=2) and Nigeria (n=2). All individuals were killed in small-scale coastal fisheries, presumably as accidental net entanglements, though directed takes cannot be excluded. All landed dolphins were butchered for human consumption (marine bushmeat). Nigerian fishers indicated also an alternative use as shark bait. If local markets in cetacean bushmeat and bait develop, as in Ghana, that will exacerbate pressures by encouraging directed takes. Catch records in Nigeria and sightings in Togo authenticate both nations as (long-suspected) range states for S. teuszii, a belated documenting of the primary, historical distribution. The Gulf of Guinea stock ( Cameroon dolphins) extends at least from Togo to southern Cameroon, and probably into Equatorial Guinea. However, rare sightings of small groups point to remnant, not thriving, dolphin communities. We anticipate de novo distribution gaps emerging and consolidating, following decades of fisheries interactions and creeping encroachment on once pristine coastal habitat. Developed coastlines in Ghana and Cote dIvoire devoid of records may already constitute such gaps. As the lack or scarcity of records warn about formidable challenges to the long-term survival of S. teuszii, innovative, workable protection measures are needed, soonest. We recommend the implementation of several new border-straddling marine protected areas (cf. Saloum Delta-Niumi National Park Complex) which could bring forth a major conservation effect. Binational involvement bears obvious advantages, from sharing responsibilities and allowing for larger protected areas. Suggested dolphin sanctuary examples could include MPAs straddling borders between Cameroon/Equatorial Guinea and Guinea-Bissau/Guinea-Conakry.",
