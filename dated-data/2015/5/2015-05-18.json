    "abstract": "Under modern interrogation, famously well-studied neural circuits such as that for orientation tuning in V1 are steadily giving up their secrets, but quite basic questions about connectivity and dynamics, including whether most computation is done by lateral processing or by selective feedforward summation, remain unresolved. We show here that grid cells offer a particularly rich opportunity for dissecting the mechanistic underpinnings of a cortical circuit, through a strategy based on global circuit perturbation combined with sparse neural recordings. The strategy is based on the theoretical insight that small perturbations of circuit activity will result in characteristic quantal shifts in the spatial tuning relationships between grid cells, which should be observable from multisingle unit recordings of a small subsample of the population. The predicted shifts differ qualitatively across candidate recurrent network mechanisms, and also distinguish between recurrent versus feedforward mechanisms. More generally, the proposed strategy demonstrates how sparse neural recordings coupled with global perturbation in the grid cell system can reveal much more about circuit mechanism as it relates to function than can full knowledge of network activity or of the synaptic connectivity matrix.",

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori is an important human pathogen associated with serious gastric diseases. Owing to its medical importance and close relationship with its human host, understanding genomic patterns of global and local adaptation in H. pylori may be of particular significance for both clinical and evolutionary studies. Here we present the first such whole-genome analysis of 60 globally distributed strains, from which we inferred worldwide population structure and demographic history and shed light on interesting global and local events of positive selection, with particular emphasis on the evolution of San-associated lineages. Our results indicate a more ancient origin for the association of humans and H. pylori than previously thought. We identify several important perspectives for future clinical research on candidate selected regions that include both previously characterized genes (e.g. transcription elongation factor NusA and tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha-Inducing Protein Tip) and hitherto unknown functional genes.",

    "abstract": "Molecular clocks give \\\"Time to most recent common ancestor\\\" TMRCA of genetic trees. By Watson-Galton17 most lineages terminate, with a few overrepresented singular lineages generated by W. Hamiltons \\\"kin selection\\\"13. Applying current methods to this non-uniform branching produces greatly exaggerated TMRCA. We introduce an inhomogenous stochastic process which detects singular lineages by asymmetries, whose reduction gives true TMRCA. This implies a new method for computing mutation rates. Despite low rates similar to mitosis data, reduction implies younger TMRCA, with smaller errors. We establish accuracy by a comparison across a wide range of time, indeed this is only clock giving consistent results for both short and long term times. In particular we show that the dominant European y-haplotypes R1a1a & R1b1a2, expand from c3700BC, not reaching Anatolia before c3300BC. While this contradicts current clocks which date R1b1a2 to either the Neolithic Near East4 or Paleo-Europe20, our dates support recent genetic analysis of ancient skeletons by Reich23.",

    "abstract": "The reproducibility of experiments is key to the scientific process, and particularly necessary for accurate reporting of analyses in data-rich fields such as phylogenomics. We present ReproPhylo, a phylogenomic analysis environment developed to ensure experimental reproducibility, to facilitate the handling of large-scale data, and to assist methodological experimentation. Reproducibility, and instantaneous repeatability, is built in to the ReproPhylo system, and does not require user intervention or configuration because it stores the experimental workflow as a single, serialized Python object containing explicit provenance and environment information. This  single file approach ensures the persistence of provenance across iterations of the analysis, with changes automatically managed by the version control program Git. ReproPhylo produces an extensive human-readable report, and generates a comprehensive experimental archive file, both of which are suitable for submission with publications. The system facilitates thorough experimental exploration of both parameters and data. ReproPhylo is a platform independent CC0 python module, and is easily installed as a Docker image, with an Jupyter GUI, or as a slimmer version in a Galaxy distribution.",
