    "abstract": "The ability to precisely modify the genome in a site-specific manner is extremely useful. The CRISPR/Cas9 system facilitates precise modifications by generating RNA-guided double-strand breaks. We demonstrate that guide RNA pairs generate deletions that are repaired with a high level of precision by non-homologous end-joining in mammalian cells. We present a method called knock-in blunt ligation for exploiting this excision and repair to insert exogenous sequences in a homology-independent manner without loss of additional nucleotides. We successfully utilize this method in a human immortalized cell line and induced pluripotent stem cells to insert fluorescent protein cassettes into various loci, with efficiencies up to 35.8% in HEK293 cells. We also present a version of Cas9 fused to the FKBP12-L106P destabilization domain for investigating repair dynamics of Cas9-induced double-strand breaks. Our in vivo blunt-end cloning method and destabilization-domain-fused Cas9 variant increase the repertoire of precision genome engineering approaches.",

    "abstract": "When facing recalcitrant pollutants, soil bacteria exploit noise of catabolic promoters for deploying environmentally beneficial phenotypes such as metabolic bet-hedging an/or division of biochemical labor. While the origin of such noise in terms of upstream promoter-regulator interplay is hardly understood, its dynamics has to be somehow encrypted in the patterns of flow-cytometry data delivered by transcriptional reporter fusions. On this background, we have examined the behaviour of the Pm promoter of the environmental bacterium Pseudomonas putida and its cognate 3-methylbenzoate-responsive regulator XylS under different conditions by following expression of Pm-GFP fusions in single cells. Using mathematical modeling and computational simulations we elucidated the kinetic properties of the system and use them as a baseline code to interpret the observed fluorescence output in terms of upstream regulator variability. Transcriptional noise was predicted to depend on the intracellular physical distance between the regulator source (where the e.g. XylS is being produced in the cells) and the target promoter. Experiments with engineered bacteria where this distance is either minimized or enlarged proved the effects of proximity on noise patterns as predicted by the model. This approach not only allowed deconvolution of cytometry data into mechanistic information on the gene expression flow. But it also provided a mechanistic basis for selecting a given level of noise in engineered regulatory nodes e.g. in Synthetic Biology constructs.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the production of massive amounts of data on somatic mutations from cancer genomes. These data have led to the detection of characteristic patterns of somatic mutations or \\\"mutation signatures\\\" at an unprecedented resolution, with the potential for new insights into the causes and mechanisms of tumorigenesis.\\n\\nHere we present new methods for modelling, identifying and visualizing such mutation signatures. Our methods greatly simplify mutation signature models compared with existing approaches, reducing the number of parameters by orders of magnitude even while increasing the contextual factors (e.g. the number of flanking bases) that are accounted for. This improves both sensitivity and robustness of inferred signatures. We also provide a new intuitive way to visualize the signatures, analogous to the use of sequence logos to visualize transcription factor binding sites.\\n\\nWe illustrate our new method on somatic mutation data from urothelial carcinoma of the upper urinary tract, and a larger dataset from 30 diverse cancer types. The results illustrate several important features of our methods, including the ability of our new visualization tool to clearly highlight the key features of each signature, the improved robustness of signature inferences from small sample sizes, and more detailed inference of signature characteristics such as strand biases and sequence context effects at the base two positions 5 to the mutated site.\\n\\nThe overall framework of our work is based on probabilistic models that are closely connected with \\\"mixed-membership models\\\" which are widely used in population genetic admixture analysis, and in machine learning for document clustering. We argue that recognizing these relationships should help improve understanding of mutation signature extraction problems, and suggests ways to further improve the statistical methods.\\n\\nOur methods are implemented in an R package pmsignature (https://github.com/friend1ws/pmsignature) and a web application available at https://friend1ws.shinyapps.io/pmsignature_shiny/.\\n\\nAuthor SummarySomatic (non-inherited) mutations are acquired throughout our lives in cells throughout our body. These mutations can be caused, for example, by DNA replication errors or exposure to environmental mutagens such as tobacco smoke. Some of these mutations can lead to cancer.\\n\\nDifferent cancers, and even different instances of the same cancer, can show different distinctive patterns of somatic mutations. These distinctive patterns have become known as \\\"mutation signatures\\\". For example, C > A mutations are frequent in lung caners whereas C > T and CC > TT mutations are frequent in skin cancers. Each mutation signature may be associated with a specific kind of carcinogen, such as tobacco smoke or ultraviolet light. Identifying mutation signatures therefore has the potential to identify new carcinogens, and yield new insights into the mechanisms and causes of cancer,\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce new statistical tools for tackling this important problem. These tools provide more robust and interpretable mutation signatures compared to previous approaches, as we demonstrate by applying them to large-scale cancer genomic data.",

    "abstract": "Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) open up new opportunities for targeted mutagenesis in eukaryotic genomes. Similar to zinc-finger nucleases, sequence-specific DNA-binding domains can be fused with effector domains like the nucleolytically active part of FokI in order to induce double strand breaks (DSBs) and thereby modify the host genome on a predefined target site via non-homologous end joining. More sophisticated applications of programmable endonucleases involve the use of a DNA repair template facilitating homology-directed repair (HDR) so as to create predefined rather than random DNA sequence modifications. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the feasibility of editing the barley genome by precisely modifying a defined target DNA sequence resulting in a predicted alteration of gene function. We used gfp-specific TALENs along with a repair template that, via HDR, facilitates conversion of gfp into yfp which is associated with a single amino acid exchange in the gene product. As a result of co-bombardment of leaf epidermis, we detected YFP accumulation in about 3 out of 100 mutated cells. The creation of a functional yfp gene via HDR was unambiguously confirmed by sequencing of the respective genomic site. Predictable genetic modifications comprising only a few genomic base pairs rather than entire genes are of particular practical relevance, because they might not fall under the European regulation of genetically engineered organisms. In addition to the allele conversion accomplished in planta, a readily screenable marker system is introduced that might be useful for optimization approaches in the field of genome editing.",

    "abstract": "We performed a genome-wide scan for genetic variants that influence multiple human phenotypes by comparing large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 40 traits or diseases, including anthropometric traits (e.g. nose size and male pattern baldness), immune traits (e.g. susceptibility to childhood ear infections and Crohns disease), metabolic phenotypes (e.g. type 2 diabetes and lipid levels), and psychiatric diseases (e.g. schizophrenia and Parkinsons disease). First, we identified 307 loci (at a false discovery rate of 10%) that influence multiple traits (excluding \\\"trivial\\\" phenotype pairs like type 2 diabetes and fasting glucose). Several loci influence a large number of phenotypes; for example, variants near the blood group gene ABO influence eleven of these traits, including risk of childhood ear infections (rs635634: log-odds ratio = 0.06, P = 1.4 x 10-8) and allergies (log-odds ratio = 0.05, P = 2.5 x 10-8), among others. Similarly, a nonsynonymous variant in the zinc transporter SLC39A8 influences seven of these traits, including risk of schizophrenia (rs13107325: log-odds ratio = 0.15, P = 2 x 10-12) and Parkinsons disease (log-odds ratio = -0.15, P = 1.6 x 10-7), among others. Second, we used these loci to identify traits that share multiple genetic causes in common. For example, genetic variants that delay age of menarche in women also, on average, delay age of voice drop in men, decrease body mass index (BMI), increase adult height, and decrease risk of male pattern baldness. Finally, we identified four pairs of traits that show evidence of a causal relationship. For example, we show evidence that increased BMI causally increases triglyceride levels, and that increased liability to hypothyroidism causally decreases adult height.",

    "abstract": "In many eusocial species, queens use pheromones to influence offspring to express worker phenotypes. While evidence suggests that queen pheromones are honest signals of the queens reproductive health, here I show that queens honest signaling can result from ancestral maternal manipulation. I develop a mathematical model to study the coevolution of maternal manipulation, offspring resistance to manipulation, and maternal resource allocation. I assume that (1) maternal manipulation causes offspring to be workers against offsprings interests; (2) offspring can resist at no direct cost, as is thought to be the case with pheromonal manipulation; and (3) the mother chooses how much resource to allocate to fertility and maternal care. In the coevolution of these traits, I find that maternal care decreases, thereby increasing the benefit that offspring obtain from help, which in the long run eliminates selection for resistance. Consequently, ancestral maternal manipulation yields stable eusociality despite costless resistance. Additionally, ancestral manipulation in the long run becomes honest signaling that induces offspring to help. These results indicate that both eusociality and its commonly associated queen honest signaling can be likely to originate from ancestral manipulation.",

The distribution of the number of mutants in this experiment has been the subject of intense investigation during the last 70 years. Despite this considerable effort, most of the results have been obtained under the assumption of constant growth rate, which is far from the experimental condition. We derive here the properties of this distribution for arbitrary growth function, for both the deterministic and stochastic growth of the mutants. The derivation we propose is surprisingly simple and versatile, allowing many generalizations to be taken easily into account.",

If correct, this would have fundamental implications for the process of diversification in microbes. However, a re-examination of these data and results shows that the methodology used by NS systematically inflates the number of genes acquired at the root of each MAL, and incorrectly assumes bacterial origins for these genes. A re-analysis of their data with appropriate phylogenetic models accounting for the dynamics of gene gain and loss between lineages supports the continuous acquisition of genes over long periods in the evolution of Archaea.",

    "abstract": "Population dynamics is a central component of demography and critical for meta-population management, especially of endangered species. We employed complete individual life records to construct census data for a reintroduced black rhinoceros population over 22 years from its founding and investigated that populations dynamics to inform black rhinoceros meta-population management practice and, more generally, megaherbivore ecology. Akaikes information criterion applied to scalar models of population growth based on the generalized logistic unambiguously selected an exponential growth model (r = 0.102 {+/-} 0.017), indicating a highly successful reintroduction, but yielding no evidence of density dependence. This result is consistent with, but does not confirm, the threshold model of density dependence that has influenced black rhinoceros meta-population management. Our analysis did support previous work contending that the generalized logistic is unreliable when fit to data that do not sample the entire range of possible population sizes. A stage-based matrix model of the exponential population dynamics exhibited mild transient behaviour. We found no evidence of environmental stochasticity, consistent with our previous studies of this population that found no influence of rainfall on demographic parameters. Process noise derived from demographic stochasticity, principally reflected in annual sex-specific recruitment numbers that differed from deterministic predictions of the matrix model. Demographically driven process noise should be assumed to be a component of megaherbivore population dynamics, as these populations are typically relatively small, and should be considered in managed removals and introductions. We suggest that an extended period of exponential growth is common for megaherbivore populations growing from small size and that an increase in age at first reproduction with increasing population size, manifest in the study population, may provide a warning of density feedback prior to detectable slowing of population growth rate for megaherbivores.",
