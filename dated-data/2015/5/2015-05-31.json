    "abstract": "Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation shape tissue-type-specific proteomes, but their relative contributions remain contested. Estimates of the factors determining protein levels in human tissues do not distinguish between (i) the factors determining the variability between the abundances of different proteins, i.e., mean-level-variability and, (ii) the factors determining the physiological variability of the same protein across different tissue types, i.e., across-tissues variability. We sought to estimate the contribution of transcript levels to these two orthogonal sources of variability, and found that scaled mRNA levels can account for most of the mean-level-variability but not necessarily for across-tissues variability. The reliable quantification of the latter estimate is limited by substantial measurement noise. However, protein-to-mRNA ratios exhibit substantial across-tissues variability that is functionally concerted and reproducible across different datasets, suggesting extensive post-transcriptional regulation. These results caution against estimating protein fold-changes from mRNA fold-changes between different cell-types, and highlight the contribution of post-transcriptional regulation to shaping tissue-type-specific proteomes.",

    "abstract": "In this study, we sequenced the genome of P. pnomenusa RB38 and reported the finding of a pair of cognate luxI/R homologs which we firstly coined as ppnI, which is found adjacent to a luxR homolog, ppnR. An additional orphan luxR homolog, ppnR2 was also discovered. Multiple sequence alignment revealed that PpnI is a distinct cluster of AHL synthase compared to those of its nearest phylogenetic neighbor, Burkholderia spp. When expressed heterologously and analysed using high resolution tandem mass spectrometry, PpnI directs the synthesis of N-octanoylhomoserine lactone (C8-HSL). To our knowledge, this is the first documentation of the luxI/R homologs of the genus of Pandoraea.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the transcriptional regulatory code, as well as other types of information encoded within biomolecular sequences, will require learning biophysical models of sequence-function relationships from high-throughput data. Controlling and characterizing the noise in such experiments, however, is notoriously difficult. The unpredictability of such noise creates problems for standard likelihood-based methods in statistical learning, which require that the quantitative form of experimental noise be known precisely. However, when this unpredictability is properly accounted for, important theoretical aspects of statistical learning which remain hidden in standard treatments are revealed. Specifically, one finds a close relationship between the standard inference method, based on likelihood, and an alternative inference method based on mutual information. Here we review and extend this relationship. We also describe its implications for learning sequence-function relationships from real biological data. Finally, we detail an idealized experiment in which these results can be demonstrated analytically.",

    "abstract": "The paleontological record chronicles numerous episodes of mass extinction that severely culled the Tree of Life. Biologists have long sought to assess the extent to which these events may have impacted particular groups. We present a novel method for detecting mass-extinction events from phylogenies estimated from molecular sequence data. We develop our approach in a Bayesian statistical framework, which enables us to harness prior information on the frequency and magnitude of mass-extinction events. The approach is based on an episodic stochastic-branching process model in which rates of speciation and extinction are constant between rate-shift events. We model three types of events: (1) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in speciation rate; (2) instantaneous tree-wide shifts in extinction rate, and; (3) instantaneous tree-wide mass-extinction events. Each of the events is described by a separate compound Poisson process (CPP) model, where the waiting times between each event are exponentially distributed with event-specific rate parameters. The magnitude of each event is drawn from an event-type specific prior distribution. Parameters of the model are then estimated using a reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rjMCMC) algorithm. We demonstrate via simulation that this method has substantial power to detect the number of mass-extinction events, provides unbiased estimates of the timing of mass-extinction events, while exhibiting an appropriate (i.e., below 5%) false discovery rate even in the case of background diversification rate variation. Finally, we provide an empirical application of this approach to conifers, which reveals that this group has experienced two major episodes of mass extinction. This new approach--the CPP on Mass Extinction Times (CoMET) model--provides an effective tool for identifying mass-extinction events from molecular phylogenies, even when the history of those groups includes more prosaic temporal variation in diversification rate.",

    "abstract": "Motif search is an important step in extracting meaningful patterns from biological data. Since the general problem of motif search is intractable, there is a pressing need to develop efficient exact and approximation algorithms to solve this problem. We design novel algorithms for solving the Edit-distance-based Motif Search (EMS) problem: given two integers l, d and n biological strings, find all strings of length l that appear in each input strings with at most d substitutions, insertions and deletions. These algorithms have been evaluated on several challenging instances. Our algorithm solves a moderately hard instance (11, 3) in a couple of minutes and the next difficult instance (14, 3) in a couple of hours whereas the best previously known algorithm, EMS1, solves (11, 3) in a few hours and does not solve (13, 4) even after 3 days. This significant improvement is due to a novel and provably efficient neighborhood generation technique introduced in this paper. This efficient approach can be used in other edit distance based applications in Bioinformatics, such as k-spectrum based sequence error correction algorithms. We also use a trie based data structure to efficiently store the candidate motifs in the neighbourhood and to output the motifs in a sorted order.",
