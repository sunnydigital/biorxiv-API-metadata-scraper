    "abstract": "Gene duplication is a fundamental process in genome evolution. However, most young duplicates are degraded into pseudogenes by loss-of-function mutations, and the factors that allow some duplicate pairs to survive long-term remain controversial. One class of models to explain duplicate retention invokes sub- or neofunctionalization, especially through evolution of gene expression, while other models focus on sharing of gene dosage. While studies of whole genome duplications tend to support dosage sharing, the primary mechanisms in mammals-where duplications are small-scale and thus disrupt dosage balance- are unclear. Using RNA-seq data from 46 human and 26 mouse tissues we find that sub-functionalization of expression evolves slowly, and is rare among duplicates that arose within the placental mammals. A major impediment to subfunctionalization is that tandem duplicates tend to be co-regulated by shared genomic elements, in contrast to the standard assumption of modularity of gene expression. Instead, consistent with the dosage-sharing hypothesis, most young duplicates are down-regulated to match expression of outgroup singleton genes. Our data suggest that dosage sharing of expression is a key factor in the initial survival of mammalian duplicates, followed by slower functional adaptation enabling long-term preservation.",

    "abstract": "Many diploid organisms undergo facultative sexual reproduction. However, little is currently known concerning the distribution of neutral genetic variation amongst facultative sexuals except in very simple cases. Under-standing this distribution is important when making inferences about rates of sexual reproduction, effective population size and demographic history. Here, we extend coalescent theory in diploids with facultative sex to consider gene conversion, selfing, population subdivision, and temporal and spatial heterogeneity in rates of sex. In addition to analytical results for two-sample coalescent times, we outline a coalescent algorithm that accommodates the complexities arising from partial sex; this algorithm can be used to generate multi-sample coalescent distributions. A key result is that when sex is rare, gene conversion becomes a significant force in reducing diversity within individuals, which can remove genomic signatures of infrequent sex (the  Meselson Effect) or entirely reverse the predictions. Our models offer improved methods for assessing the null model (I.e. neutrality) of patterns of molecular variation in facultative sexuals.",
