    "abstract": "Inferring species interactions from co-occurrence data is one of the most controversial tasks in community ecology. One difficulty is that a single pairwise interaction can ripple through an ecological network and produce surprising indirect consequences. For example, the negative correlation between two competing species can be reversed in the presence of a third species that is capable of outcompeting both of them. Here, I apply models from statistical physics, called Markov networks or Markov random fields, that can predict the direct and indirect consequences of any possible species interaction matrix. Interactions in these models can also be estimated from observed co-occurrence rates via maximum likelihood, controlling for indirect effects. Using simulated landscapes with known pairwise interaction strengths, I evaluated Markov networks and six existing approaches. The Markov networks consistently outperformed other methods, correctly isolating direct interactions between species pairs even when indirect interactions or abiotic factors largely overpowered them. Two computationally efficient approximations, based on controlling for indirect effects with linear or generalized linear models, also performed well. Indirect effects reliably caused a common null modeling approach to produce incorrect inferences, however.",

    "abstract": "The abundance of phenotypic diversity among species can enrich our knowledge of development and genetics beyond the limits of variation that can be observed in model organisms. The Phenoscape Knowledgebase (KB) is designed to enable exploration and discovery of phenotypic variation among species. Because phenotypes in the KB are annotated using standard ontologies, evolutionary phenotypes can be compared with phenotypes from genetic perturbations in model organisms. To illustrate the power of this approach, we review the use of the KB to find taxa showing evolutionary variation similar to that of a query gene. Matches are made between the full set of phenotypes described for a gene and an evolutionary profile, the latter of which is defined as the set of phenotypes that are variable among the daughters of any node on the taxonomic tree. Phenoscapes semantic similarity interface allows the user to assess the statistical significance of each match and flags matches that may only result from differences in annotation coverage between genetic and evolutionary studies. Tools such as this will help meet the challenge of relating the growing volume of genetic knowledge in model organisms to the diversity of phenotypes in nature. The Phenoscape KB is available at http://kb.phenoscape.org.",

    "abstract": "Free iron is highly toxic and the blood-derived iron initiates early motor-neuron degeneration upon breakdown of blood-spinal cord barrier. Iron is currently known to trigger oxidative stress by Fenton chemistry but no report implies that iron manifests its toxicity through CuZn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1), the central antioxidant enzyme in all human tissues that carries >180 ALS-causing mutations. Here, by NMR we show that Zn2+ play an irreplaceable role in the maturation of the nascent hSOD1, and further decipher for the first time that out of 11 other cations only Fe2+ has the Zn2+-like capacity to induce folding to form the Fe2+-bound hSOD1. This acts to reduce or even block the maturation of wild-type and ALS-causing mutant hSOD1, consequently trapping SOD1 in toxic forms and provoking oxidative stress. Our study establishes a novel SOD1-dependent mechanism for iron to manifest cellular toxicity that contributes to pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, aging and even more.\\n\\nOne Sentence SummaryOur study establishes a novel SOD1-dependent mechanism for iron to manifest toxicity contributing to neurodegenerative diseases, aging and even more.",

    "abstract": "There is a striking visual symmetry between the 'paradoxical combinator' (which implements recursion in the mathematical theory of computation) and the biological replication fork (which implements reproduction in the living cell). Can this mean anything? Living organisms are information processors - the genome encodes instructions for the process of life much as computer programs encode instructions for a computer. Replication in biological systems is intuitively similar to recursion in computational systems. The following discussion will present enough of the mathematics to allow biologists to make sense of the symmetries in the logo. Mathematicians will learn nothing new about biology, but may be encouraged to look at biological processes from a new perspective.\\n\\nComputational biology: a flight of fancy Computational biology: a flight...
