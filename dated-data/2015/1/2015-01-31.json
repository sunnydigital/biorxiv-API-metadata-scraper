    "abstract": "Sleep and circadian rhythms are ancient, related phenomena controlled by distinct circuitry, whose appropriate regulation is critical to health. The regulatory machinery underlying sleep homeostasis is ill-defined, but biological clock mechanisms are better understood: from  clock gene oscillations to rest/activity cycles. Age- and neurodegeneration-related deterioration in sleep/wake timing was first described in humans decades ago, and has recently been recapitulated in model organisms. To delineate causal relationships between aging, sleep, neuronal function and the molecular clockwork, we developed FLYGLOW, a bioluminescence-based system which allows rest/activity, sleep consolidation and molecular rhythms to be quantified simultaneously in many individual flies over days/weeks. FLYGLOW outperforms existing methods, and allows multiparameter correlational analyses within and between flies. We also show unambiguously that peripheral tissue rhythms free-run independently of the central pacemakers driving behavioural cycles. Using an Alzheimers fly model we observe a profound disorganization of sleep/wake cycles, phenocopying the human disease.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of High-throughput sequencing (HTS) data is a difficult problem, especially in the context of non-model organisms where comparison of homologous sequences may be hindered by the lack of a close reference genome. Current mapping-based methods rely on the availability of a highly similar reference sequence, whereas de novo assemblies produce anonymous (unannotated) contigs that are not easily compared across samples. Here, we present Assembly by Reduced Complexity (ARC) a hybrid mapping and assembly approach for targeted assembly of homologous sequences. ARC is an open-source project (http://ibest.github.io/ARC/) implemented in the Python language and consists of the following stages: 1) align sequence reads to reference targets, 2) use alignment results to distribute reads into target specific bins, 3) perform assemblies for each bin (target) to produce contigs, and 4) replace previous reference targets with assembled contigs and iterate. We show that ARC is able to assemble high quality, unbiased mitochondrial genomes seeded from 11 progressively divergent references, and is able to assemble full mitochondrial genomes starting from short, poor quality ancient DNA reads. We also show ARC compares favorably to de novo assembly of a large exome capture dataset for CPU and memory requirements; assembling 7,627 individual targets across 55 samples, completing over 1.3 million assemblies in less than 78 hours, while using under 32 Gb of system memory. ARC breaks the assembly problem down into many smaller problems, solving the anonymous contig and poor scaling inherent in some de novo assembly methods and reference bias inherent in traditional read mapping.",
