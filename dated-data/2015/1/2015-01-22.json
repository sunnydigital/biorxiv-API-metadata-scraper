    "abstract": "Insight, Innovation and IntegrationDoxycycline, a derivative of tetracycline, induces gene expression via reversible transcriptional activation. Levels of /3-catenin and other intra/extracellular genetic factors have been influenced in colorectal cancer cell lines, which make doxycycline a potential candidate for cancer chemotherapy. With the aim to build better computational models that show good prediction on test datasets, doxycycline treated cell lines might provide best training samples. This work tests the reproducibility of parameter learning and predictions based on the estimated parameters, using the Naive Bayesian Networks for Wnt pathway in case of missing observations for different nodes. The in silico experiments show the efficacy of causal models as one of the emerging diagnostic tools in development of targeted cancer therapy.\\n\\nRecent efforts in predicting Wnt signaling activation via inference methods have helped in developing diagnostic models for therapeutic drug targeting. In this manuscript the reproducibility of parameter learning with missing observations in a Bayesian Network and its effect on prediction results for Wnt signaling activation is tested, while training the networks on doxycycline treated LS174T cell lines as well as normal and adenomas samples. This is done in order to check the effectiveness of using Bayesian Network as a tool for modeling Wnt pathway when certain observations are missing. Experimental analysis suggest that prediction results are reproducible with negligible deviations. Anomalies in estimated parameters are accounted for due to the Bayesian Network model. Also, an interesting case regarding usage of hypothesis testing came up while proving the statistical significance of different design setups of the BN model which was trained on the same data. It was found that hypothesis testing may not be the correct way to check the significance between design setups for the aforementioned case, especially when the structure of the model is same. Finally, in comparison to the biologically inspired models, the naive bayesian model may give accurate results but this accuracy comes at the cost of loss of crucial biological knowledge which might help reveal hidden relations among intra/extracellular factors affecting the Wnt pathway.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of RNA-sequencing technology we now have the power to detect different types of alternative splicing and how DNA variation affects splicing. However, given the short read lengths used in most population based RNA-sequencing experiments, quantifying transcripts accurately remains a challenge. Here we present a novel method, Altrans, for discovery of alternative splicing quantitative trait loci (asQTLs). To assess the performance of Altrans we compared it to Cufflinks, a well-established transcript quantification method. Simulations show that in the presence of transcripts absent from the annotation, Altrans performs better in quantifications than Cufflinks. We have applied Altrans and Cufflinks to the Geuvadis dataset, which comprises samples from European and African populations, and discovered (FDR = 1%) 1806 and 243 asQTLs with Altrans, and 1596 and 288 asQTLs with Cufflinks for Europeans and Africans, respectively. Although Cufflinks results replicated better across the two populations, this likely due to the increased sensitivity of Altrans in detecting harder to detect associations. We show that, by discovering a set of asQTLs in a smaller subset of European samples and replicating these in the remaining larger subset of Europeans, both methods achieve similar replication levels (94% and 98% replication in Altrans and Cufflinks, respectively). We find that method specific asQTLs are largely due to different types of alternative splicing events detected by each method. We overlapped the asQTLs with biochemically active regions of the genome and observed significant enrichments for many functional marks and variants in splicing regions, highlighting the biological relevance of the asQTLs identified. All together, we present a novel approach for discovering asQTLs that is a more direct assessment of splicing compared to other methods and is complementary to other transcript quantification methods.",

    "abstract": "We have carried out a comprehensive analysis of the determinants of human influenza A H3 hemagglutinin evolution, considering three distinct predictors of evolutionary variation at individual sites: solvent accessibility (as a proxy for protein fold stability and/or conservation), experimental epitope sites (as a proxy for host immune bias), and proximity to the receptor-binding region (as a proxy for protein function). We found that these three predictors individually explain approximately 15% of the variation in site-wise dN/dS. The solvent accessibility and proximity predictors were largely independent of each other, while the epitope sites were not. In combination, solvent accessibility and proximity explained 32% of the variation in dN/dS. Incorporating experimental epitope sites into the model added only an additional 2 percentage points. We also found that the historical H3 epitope sites, which date back to the 1980s and 1990s, showed only weak overlap with the latest experimental epitope data. Finally, sites with dN/dS > 1, i.e., the sites most likely driving seasonal immune escape, are not correctly predicted by either historical or experimental epitope sites, but only by proximity to the receptor-binding region. In summary, proximity to the receptor-binding region, and not host immune bias, seems to be the primary determinant of H3 evolution.\\n\\nAuthor summaryThe influenza virus is one of the most rapidly evolving human viruses. Every year, it accumulates mutations that allow it to evade the host immune response of previously infected individuals. Which sites in the virus genome allow this immune escape and the manner of escape is not entirely understood, but conventional wisdom states that specific \\\"immune epitope sites\\\" in the protein hemagglutinin are preferentially attacked by host antibodies and that these sites mutate to directly avoid host recognition; as a result, these sites are commonly targeted by vaccine development efforts. Here, we combine influenza hemagglutinin sequence data, protein structural information, experimental immune epitope data, and historical epitopes to demonstrate that neither the historical epitope groups nor epitopes based on experimental data are crucial for predicting the rate of influenza evolution. Instead, we find that a simple geometrical model works best: sites that are closest to the location where the virus binds the human receptor are the primary driver of hemagglutinin evolution. There are two possible explanations for this result. First, the existing historical and experimental epitope sites may not be the real antigenic sites in hemagglutinin. Second, alternatively, hemagglutinin antigenicity may not the primary driver of influenza evolution.",

    "abstract": "During the last decade genome-wide association studies have proven to be a powerful approach to identifying disease-causing variants. However, for admixed populations, most current methods for performing association testing are based on the assumption that the effect of a genetic variant is the same regardless of its ancestry. This is a reasonable assumption for a causal variant, but may not hold for the genetic variants that are tested in genome-wide association studies, which are usually not causal. The effects of non-causal genetic variants depend on how strongly their presence correlate with the presence of the causal variant, which may vary between ancestral populations because of different linkage disequilibrium patterns and allele frequencies.\\n\\nMotivated by this, we here introduce a new statistical method for association testing in recently admixed populations, where the effect size is allowed to depend on the ancestry of a given allele. Our method does not rely on accurate inference of local ancestry, yet using simulations we show that in some scenarios it gives a dramatic increase in statistical power to detect associations. In addition, the method allows for testing for difference in effect size between ancestral populations, which can be used to help determine if a SNP is causal. We demonstrate the usefulness of the method on data from the Greenlandic population.",

    "abstract": "Genomic selection, enabled by whole genome prediction (WGP) methods, is revolutionizing plant breeding. Existing WGP methods have been shown to deliver accurate predictions in the most common settings, such as prediction of across environment performance for traits with additive gene effects. However, prediction of traits with non-additive gene effects and prediction of genotype by environment interaction (GxE), continues to be challenging. Previous attempts to increase prediction accuracy for these particularly difficult tasks employed prediction methods that are purely statistical in nature. Augmenting the statistical methods with biological knowledge has been largely overlooked thus far. Crop growth models (CGMs) attempt to represent the impact of functional relationships between plant physiology and the environment in the formation of yield and similar output traits of interest. Thus, they can explain the impact of GxE and certain types of non-additive gene effects on the expressed phenotype. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), a novel and powerful computational procedure, allows the incorporation of CGMs directly into the estimation of whole genome marker effects in WGP. Here we provide a proof of concept study for this novel approach and demonstrate its use with synthetic data sets. We show that this novel approach can be considerably more accurate than the benchmark WGP method GBLUP in predicting performance in environments represented in the estimation set as well as in previously unobserved environments for traits determined by non-additive gene effects. We conclude that this proof of concept demonstrates that using ABC for incorporating biological knowledge in the form of CGMs into WGP is a very promising and novel approach to improving prediction accuracy for some of the most challenging scenarios in plant breeding and applied genetics.",

    "abstract": "Strangles, the most frequently diagnosed infectious disease of horses worldwide, is caused by Streptococcus equi. Despite its prevalence, the global diversity and mechanisms underlying the evolution of S. equi as a host-restricted pathogen remain poorly understood. Here we define the global population structure of this important pathogen and reveal a population replacement in the late 19th or early 20th century, contemporaneous with a spate of global conflicts. Our data reveal a dynamic genome that continues to mutate and decay, but also to amplify and acquire genes despite the organism having lost its natural competence and become host-restricted.\\n\\nThe lifestyle of S. equi within the horse is defined by short-term acute disease, strangles, followed by long-term carriage. Population analysis reveals evidence of convergent evolution in isolates from post-acute disease samples, as a result of niche adaptation to persistent carriage within a host. Mutations that lead to metabolic streamlining and the loss of virulence determinants are more frequently found in carriage isolates, suggesting that the pathogenic potential of S. equi reduces as a consequence of long term residency within the horse post acute disease. An example of this is the deletion of the equibactin siderophore locus that is associated with iron acquisition, which occurs exclusively in carrier isolates, and renders S. equi significantly less able to cause acute disease in the natural host. We identify several loci that may similarly be required for the full virulence of S. equi, directing future research towards the development of new vaccines against this host-restricted pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Coherent percepts emerge from the accurate combination of inputs from the different sensory systems. There is ongoing debate about the neurophysiological implementation of crossmodal interactions in the brain, and it has been proposed that transient synchronization of neurons might be of central importance. Specifically, oscillatory activity in lower frequency ranges (< 30 Hz) has been implicated in mediating long-range communication as typically studied in multisensory research. In the current study, we recorded high-density electroencephalograms (EEG) while human participants were engaged in a visual-tactile pattern matching paradigm. Employing the same physical stimulation, separate tasks of the experiment either required the detection of predefined targets in visual and tactile modalities or the explicit evaluation of crossmodal stimulus congruence. Analysis of the behavioral data showed benefits for congruent visual-tactile stimulus combinations. Differences in oscillatory dynamics within the two tasks related to crossmodal congruence involved effects in the theta-(2-7 Hz), alpha-(813 Hz) and beta-band (13-25 Hz). Contrasting neuronal activity between the two tasks revealed differences in pre-stimulus alpha- and beta-band power, as well as differences in post-stimulus theta-band activity. Source reconstruction for these effects showed prominent involvement of superior temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices - regions commonly implicated in multisensory integration. These results add to the increasing evidence that low frequency oscillations are well suited for studying integration in distributed brain networks, as demonstrated for crossmodal interactions in visual-tactile pattern matching in the current study. Additionally, neuronal activity at theta-, alpha- and beta-frequencies might subserve distinct processes relevant for multisensory integration, such as multisensory gating and crossmodal perceptual decision making.",

    "abstract": "Databases of structural connections of the mammalian brain, such as CoCoMac (cocomac.g-node.org) or BAMS (brancusi.usc.edu), are valuable resources for the analysis of brain connectivity and the modeling of brain dynamics in species such as the non-human primate or the rodent, and have also contributed to the computational modeling of the human brain. Another model species that is widely used in electrophysiological or developmental studies is the ferret; however, no systematic compilation of brain connectivity is currently available for this species. Thus, we have started developing a database of anatomical connections and architectonic features of the ferret brain (the Ferretome, www.ferretome.org). The main goals of this database project are: (1) to assemble structural information on the ferret brain that is currently widely distributed in the literature or in different in-house laboratory databases into a single resource which is open to the scientific community; (2) to try and build an extendable community resource that is beneficial to researchers in neuroinformatics and computational neuroscience, as well as to neuroanatomists, by adding value to their data through algorithms for efficient data representation, analysis and visualization; (3) to create techniques for the representation of quantitative and raw data; and (4) to expand existing database ontologies in order to accommodate further neuroarchitectural information for identifying essential relations between brain structure and connections.\\n\\nThe Ferretome database has adapted essential features of the CoCoMac methodology and legacy. In particular, its data model is derived from CoCoMac. It also uses a semantic parcellation of ferret brain regions as well as a logical brain maps transformation algorithm (objective relational transformation, ORT). The database is being developed in MySQL and has been populated with literature reports on tract tracing observations in the ferret brain using a custom-designed web interface that allows efficient and validated simultaneous input and proofreading by multiple curators. The database is also equipped with a web interface for generating output data that was designed with non-computer science specialist users in mind. This interface can be extended to produce connectivity matrices in several formats including a graphical representation superimposed on established ferret brain maps. An important feature of the Ferretome database is the possibility to trace back entries in connectivity matrices to the original studies archived in the system.\\n\\nCurrently, the Ferretome contains 50 reports on connections comprising 20 injection reports with more than 150 labeled source and target areas, the majority reflecting connectivity of subcortical nuclei. We hope that the Ferretome database will become a useful resource for neuroinformatics and neural modeling, and will support studies of the ferret brain as well as facilitate advances in comparative studies of mesoscopic brain connectivity.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of the human brain to interpret and respond to multiple temporal scales in its surroundings suggests that its internal interactions must also be able to operate over a broad temporal range. In this paper, we utilise a recently introduced method for characterising the rate of change of the phase difference between MEG signals and use it to study the temporal structure of the phase interactions between MEG recordings from the left and right motor cortices during rest and during a finger-tapping task. We use the Hilbert transform to estimate moment-to-moment fluctuations of the phase difference between signals. After confirming the presence of scale-invariance we estimate the Hurst exponent using detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). An exponent of >0.5 is indicative of long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs) in the signal. We find that LRTCs are present in the / and {beta} frequency bands of resting state MEG data. We demonstrate that finger movement disrupts LRTCs correlations, producing a phase relationship with a structure similar to that of Gaussian white noise. The results are validated by applying the same analysis to data with Gaussian white noise phase difference, recordings from an empty scanner and phase-shuffled time series. We interpret the findings through comparison of the results with those we obtained from an earlier study during which we adopted this method to characterise phase relationships within a Kuramoto model of oscillators in its sub-critical, critical and super-critical synchronisation states. We find that the resting state MEG from left and right motor cortices shows moment-to-moment fluctuations of phase difference with a similar temporal structure to that of a system of Kuramoto oscillators just prior to its critical level of coupling, and that finger tapping moves the system away from this pre-critical state towards a more random state.",
