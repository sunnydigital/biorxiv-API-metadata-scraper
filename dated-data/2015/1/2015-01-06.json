    "abstract": "Populations arrayed along broad latitudinal gradients often show patterns of clinal variation in phenotype and genotype. Such population differentiation can be generated and maintained by historical demographic events and local adaptation. These evolutionary forces are not mutually exclusive and, moreover, can in some cases produce nearly identical patterns of genetic differentiation among populations. Here, we investigate the evolutionary forces that generated and maintain clinal variation genome-wide among populations of Drosophila melanogaster sampled in North America and Australia. We contrast patterns of clinal variation in these continents with patterns of differentiation among ancestral European and African populations. Using established and novel methods we derive here, we show that recently derived North America and Australia populations were likely founded by both European and African lineages and that this admixture event contributed to genome-wide patterns of parallel clinal variation. The pervasive effects of admixture meant that only a handful of loci could be attributed to the operation of spatially varying selection using an FST outlier approach. Our results provide novel insight into the well-studied system of clinal differentiation in D. melanogaster and provide a context for future studies seeking to identify loci contributing to local adaptation in a wide variety of organisms, including other invasive species as well as some temperate endemics.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the progress of DNA molecules through a membrane pore has been postulated as a method for sequencing DNA for several decades. Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available that we used for sequencing the S. cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr (https://github.com/jgurtowski/nanocorr) specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, as existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5-50kbp) at such high error rate (between [~]5 and 40% error). With this new method we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: the contig N50 length is more than ten-times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678kb versus 59.9kbp), and has greater than 99.88% consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.\\n\\nReviewer link to datahttp://schatzlab.cshl.edu/data/nanocorr/",

    "abstract": "Introgression is the transfer of genes or genomic regions from one species into another via hybridization and back-crosses. We have introgressed four translocations (EB4, IBj5, UK14-1, and B362i) from Neurospora crassa into N. tetrasperma. This enabled us to construct heterokaryotic [T + N] and [Dp + Df] strains in which the mat-A and mat-a nuclei have different genotypes. Self-crosses of the heterokaryons again produced [T + N] and [Dp + Df] progeny. From conidia (vegetative spores) produced by the heterokaryotic mycelia we obtained self-fertile (heterokaryotic) and self-sterile (homokaryotic) derivative strains. [T + N] heterokaryons produced homokaryotic derivatives of both mating types, but [Dp + Df] heterokaryons produced viable homokaryons of only the mating type of the Dp nucleus. All the four [T + N] heterokaryons, and three [Dp + Df] heterokaryons, produced both self-sterile and self-fertile conidial derivatives, but the [Dp(B362i) + Df(B362i)] heterokaryons produced only self-sterile ones. Conceivably, the Df(B362i) nuclei may be deleted for a nucleus-limited gene required for efficient mitosis or nuclear division, and whose deficit is not complemented by the neighboring Dp(B362i) nuclei. Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) was shown to occur in a Dp-heterozygous cross, therefore RIP-alteration of a translocated segment would depend on relative numbers of self-crosses undergone in [Dp + Df] versus [T + N] ancestors.",

    "abstract": "The function of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) depends on their location within the cell. While most studies to date have concentrated on their nuclear roles in transcriptional regulation, evidence is mounting that lncRNA also have cytoplasmic roles. Here we comprehensively map the cytoplasmic and ribosomal lncRNA population in a human cell. Three-quarters (74%) of lncRNAs are detected in the cytoplasm, the majority of which (62%) preferentially cofractionate with polyribosomes. Ribosomal lncRNA are highly expressed across tissues, under purifying evolutionary selection, and have cytoplasmic-to-nuclear ratios comparable to mRNAs and consistent across cell types. LncRNAs may be classified into three groups by their ribosomal interaction: non-ribosomal cytoplasmic lncRNAs, and those associated with either heavy or light polysomes. A number of mRNA-like features destin lncRNA for light polysomes, including capping and 5UTR length, but not cryptic open reading frames or polyadenylation. Surprisingly, exonic retroviral sequences antagonise recruitment. In contrast, it appears that lncRNAs are recruited to heavy polysomes through basepairing to mRNAs. Finally, we show that the translation machinery actively degrades lncRNA. We propose that light polysomal lncRNAs are translationally engaged, while heavy polysomal lncRNAs are recruited indirectly. These findings point to extensive and reciprocal regulatory interactions between lncRNA and the translation machinery.",

    "abstract": "To study olfaction, first we should know which physical or chemical properties of odorant molecules determine the response of olfactory receptor neurons, and then we should study the effect of those properties on the combinatorial encoding in olfactory system.\\n\\nIn this work we show that the response of an olfactory receptor neuron in Drosophila depends on molecular volume of an odorant; The molecular volume determines the upper limits of the neural response, while the actual neural response may depend on other properties of the molecules. Each olfactory receptor prefers a particular volume, with some degree of flexibility. These two parameters predict the volume and flexibility of the binding-pocket of the olfactory receptors, which are the targets of structural biology studies.\\n\\nAt the end we argue that the molecular volume can affects the quality of perceived smell of an odorant via the combinatorial encoding, molecular volume may mask other underlying relations between properties of molecules and neural responses and we suggest a way to improve the selection of odorants in further experimental studies.",
