    "abstract": "Analysis of environmental DNA (eDNA) enables the detection of species of interest from water and soil samples, typically using species-specific PCR. Here, we describe a method to characterize the biodiversity of a given environment by amplifying eDNA using primer pairs targeting a wide range of taxa and high-throughput sequencing for species identification. We tested this approach on 91 water samples of 40 mL collected along the Cuyahoga River (Ohio, USA). We amplified eDNA using 12 primer pairs targeting mammals, fish, amphibians, birds, bryophytes, arthropods, copepods, plants and several microorganism taxa and sequenced all PCR products simultaneously by high-throughput sequencing. Overall, we identified DNA sequences from 15 species of fish, 17 species of mammals, 8 species of birds, 15 species of arthropods, one turtle and one salamander. Interestingly, in addition to aquatic and semiaquatic animals, we identified DNA from terrestrial species that live near the Cuyahoga River. We also identified DNA from one Asian carp species invasive to the Great Lakes but that had not been previously reported in the Cuyahoga River. Our study shows that analysis of eDNA extracted from small water samples using wide-range PCR amplification combined with high-throughput sequencing can provide a broad perspective on biological diversity.",

    "abstract": "1The accurate identification of low-frequency variants in tumors remains an unsolved problem. To support characterization of the issues in a realistic setting, we have developed software tools and a reference dataset for diagnosing variant calling pipelines. The dataset contains millions of variants at frequencies ranging from 0.05 to 1.0. To generate the dataset, we performed whole-genome sequencing of a mixture of two Corriel cell lines, NA19240 and NA12878, the mothers of YRI (Y) and CEU (C) HapMap trios, respectively. The cells were mixed in three different proportions, 10Y/90C, 50Y/50C and 90Y/10C, in an effort to simulate the heterogeneity found in tumor samples. We sequenced three biological replicates for each mixture, yielding approximately 1.4 billion reads per mixture for an average of 64X coverage. Using the published genotypes as our reference, we evaluate the performance of a general variant calling algorithm, constructed as a demonstration of our flexible toolset, and make comparisons to a standard GATK pipeline. We estimate the overall FDR to be 0.028 and the FNR (when coverage exceeds 20X) to be 0.019 in the 50Y/50C mixture. Interestingly, even with these relatively well studied individuals, we predict over 475,000 new variants, validating in well-behaved coding regions at a rate of 0.97, that were not included in the published genotypes.",

    "abstract": "Advances in RNA-seq technologies provide unprecedented insight into the variability and heterogeneity of gene expression at the single-cell level. However, such data offers only a snapshot of the transcriptome, whereas it is often the progression of cells through dynamic biological processes that is of interest. As a result, one outstanding challenge is to infer such progressions by ordering gene expression from single cell data alone, known as the cell ordering problem. Here, we introduce a new method that constructs a low-dimensional non-linear embedding of the data using laplacian eigenmaps before assigning each cell a pseudotime using principal curves. We characterise why on a theoretical level our method is more robust to the high levels of noise typical of single-cell RNA-seq data before demonstrating its utility on two existing datasets of differentiating cells.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundTechnological advances in DNA sequencing have made gene testing fast and more affordable. Evidence of cost-effectiveness of genetic service models is essential for successful translation, but remain sparse in the literature. In particular there is a lack of cost data related to genetic services.\\n\\nMethodsA detailed micro-costing of 28 pathways relating to breast and/or ovarian cancer and gene testing for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (termed  BRCA testing) was carried out. These data were combined with patient-level data from a Royal Marsden Cancer Genetics Service audit during which BRCA testing was offered to individuals at [&ge;]10% risk of having a mutation.\\n\\nResultsThe average cost across all pathways was {pound}2,222.68 (range {pound}376.47-{pound}13,531.24). The average pathway cost for a person with cancer was {pound}1897.71 compared to {pound}2,403.22 for a person without cancer. Of the women seen during audit period, 38% were affected with breast and/or ovarian cancer and 62% were unaffected but concerned about their family history.\\n\\nConclusionThere is considerable variation in the costs of different gene testing pathways. Improved cost-efficiency could be achieved by increasing the proportion of cancer patients tested, because the pathway cost of an unaffected individual in whom testing has already been performed in a relative with cancer is considerably less.\\n\\nAcknowledgementsWe acknowledge NHS funding to the Royal Marsden/ICR NIHR Specialist Biomedical Research Centre for Cancer.

While the existence and stability of leader neurons is well established, the influence of stimulation on the leader-follower dynamics is not sufficiently understood. By combining multi-electrode array recordings with whole field optical stimulation of cultured Channelrhodopsin-2 transduced hippocampal neurons, we show that fade-in photo-stimulation induces a significant shortening of intra-burst firing rate peak delay of follower electrodes after offset of the stimulation compared to unperturbed spontaneous activity. Our study shows that optogenetic stimulation can be used to change the dynamical fine structure of self-organized network bursts.",

    "abstract": "AbstractAlthough a large number of methods have been proposed to control the non-linear dynamics of unstable popuations, very few have been actually adopted for application. One reason for this gap is the fact that few control methods have been empirically verified using biological populations. To address this issue, we investigated the effects of two well-studied control methods (Both Limiter Control and Target-Oriented Control) on the dynamics of unstable populations of Drosophila melanogaster. We show that both methods can significantly reduce population fluctuations, decrease extinction probability and increase effective population size simultaneously. This is in contrast with single parameter control methods that are not able to achieve multiple aspects of stability at the same time. We use the distribution of population sizes to derive biologically intuitive explanations for the mechanisms of how these two control methods attain stability. Finally, we show that non-Drosophila specific biologically realistic simulations are able to capture almost all the trends of our data. This shows that our results are likely generalizable over a wide range of taxa. The primary insight of our study is that control methods that incorporate both culling and restocking have better all-round performance in terms of stabilizing populations.",

    "abstract": "Animals and plants have evolved a range of mechanisms for recognizing noxious substances and organisms. A particular challenge, most successfully met by the adaptive immune system in vertebrates, is the specific recognition of potential pathogens, which themselves evolve to escape recognition. A variety of genomic and evolutionary mechanisms shape large families of proteins dedicated to detecting pathogens and create the diversity of binding sites needed for epitope recognition. One family involved in innate immunity are the NACHT-domain-and Leucine-Rich-Repeat-containing (NLR) proteins. Mammals have a small number of NLR proteins, which are involved in first-line immune defense and recognize several conserved molecular patterns. However, there is no evidence that they cover a wider spectrum of differential pathogenic epitopes. In other species, mostly those without adaptive immune systems, NLRs have expanded into very large families. A family of nearly 400 NLR proteins is encoded in the zebrafish genome. They are subdivided into four groups defined by their NACHT and effector domains, with a characteristic overall structure that arose in fishes from a fusion of the NLR domains with a domain used for immune recognition, the B30.2 domain. The majority of the genes are located on one chromosome arm, interspersed with other large multi-gene families, including a new family encoding proteins with multiple tandem arrays of Zinc fingers. This chromosome arm may be a hot spot for evolutionary change in the zebrafish genome. NLR genes not on this chromosome tend to be located near chromosomal ends.\\n\\nExtensive duplication, loss of genes and domains, exon shuffling and gene conversion acting differentially on the NACHT and B30.2 domains have shaped the family. Its four groups, which are conserved across the fishes, are homogenised within each group by gene conversion, while the B30.2 domain is subject to gene conversion across the groups. Evidence of positive selection on diversifying mutations in the B30.2 domain, probably driven by pathogen interactions, indicates that this domain rather than the LRRs acts as a recognition domain. The NLR-B30.2 proteins represent a new family with diversity in the specific recognition module that is present in fishes in spite of the parallel existence of an adaptive immune system.",

Maintained infrastructure corridors, such as those containing electricity transmission lines, are potentially important wild pollinator habitat. However, there is a lack of evidence comparing the abundance and diversity of wild pollinators in transmission corridors with other important pollinator habitats. We compared the diversity of a key pollinator group, bumble bees (Bombus spp.), between transmission corridors and the surrounding semi-natural and managed habitat types at ten sites across Swedens Uppland region. Our results show that transmission corridors have no impact on bumble bee diversity in the surrounding area. However, transmission corridors and other maintained habitats have a level of bumble bees abundance and diversity comparable to semi-natural grasslands and host species that are important for conservation and ecosystem service provision. Under the current management regime, transmission corridors already provide valuable bumble bee habitat, but given that host plant density is the main determinant of bumble bee abundance, these areas could potentially be enhanced by establishing and maintaining key host plants. We show that in northern temperate regions the maintenance of transmission corridors has the potential to contribute to bumble bee conservation and the ecosystem services they provide.",

Over-expressing ZNF191 in HCC cells impaired cell motility, while ZNF191 depletion promoted HCC cell migration in vitro and metastasis in vivo through triggering yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) signaling. Chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that ZNF191 specifically bound to the promoter of Discs, Large homolog 1 (DLG1), a cell polarity maintainer and a negative regulator of YAP1. Double-knockdown experiments showed that DLG1 was not only the mediator of ZNF191s function to suppress migration but also a link between ZNF191 and YAP1 signaling. ZNF191 was down-regulated in metastatic HCCs, correlating positively with DLG1 levels and inversely with YAP1 activation. Our findings indicate ZNF191 functions as a metastasis suppressor via DLG1-mediated YAP1 signaling inactivation.",
