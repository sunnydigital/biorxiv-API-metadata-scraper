    "abstract": "Behavioral and sensory adaptations are often based in the differential expansion of brain components. These volumetric differences represent changes in investment, processing capacity and/or connectivity, and can be used to investigate functional and evolutionary relationships between different brain regions, and between brain composition and behavioral ecology. Here, we describe the brain composition of two species of Heliconius butterflies, a long-standing study system for investigating ecological adaptation and speciation. We confirm a previous report of striking mushroom body expansion, and explore patterns of post-eclosion growth and experience-dependent plasticity in neural development. This analysis uncovers age-and experience-dependent post-emergence mushroom body growth comparable to that in foraging hymenoptera, but also identifies plasticity in several other neuropil. An interspecific analysis indicates that Heliconius display remarkable levels of investment in mushroom bodies for a lepidopteran, and indeed rank highly compared to other insects. Our analyses lay the foundation for future comparative and experimental analyses that will establish Heliconius as a useful case study in evolutionary neurobiology.",

    "abstract": "The fossil record is a rich source of information about biological diversity in the past. However, the fossil record is not only incomplete but has inherent biases due to geological, physical, chemical and biological factors. Our knowledge of past life is also biased because of differences in academic and amateur interests and sampling efforts. As a result, not all individuals or species that lived in the past are equally likely to be discovered at any point in time or space. To reconstruct temporal dynamics of diversity using the fossil record, biased sampling must be explicitly taken into account. Here, we introduce an approach that utilizes the variation in the number of times each species is observed in the fossil record to estimate both sampling bias and true richness. We term our technique TRiPS (True Richness estimated using a Poisson Sampling model) and explore its robustness to violation of its assumptions via simulations. We then venture to estimate sampling bias and absolute species richness of dinosaurs in the geological stages of the Mesozoic. Using TRiPS, we estimate that 1936 (1543-2468) species of dinosaurs roamed the Earth during the Mesozoic. We also present improved estimates of species richness trajectories of the three major dinosaur clades; the sauropodomorphs, ornithischians and theropods, casting doubt on the Jurassic-Cretaceous extinction event and demonstrating that all dinosaur groups are subject to considerable sampling bias throughout the Mesozoic.",

    "abstract": "Bluegill sunfish are one of the classic systems for studying male alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) in teleost fishes. In this species, there are two distinct life histories: parental and cuckolder, encompassing three reproductive tactics, parental, satellite, and sneaker. The parental life history is fixed, whereas individuals who enter the cuckolder life history transition from the sneaker to the satellite tactic as they grow. For this study, we used RNAseq to characterize the brain transcriptome of the three male tactics and females during spawning to identify gene categories associated with each tactic and identify potential candidate genes influencing their different spawning behaviors. We found that sneaker males had higher levels of gene differentiation compared to the other two male tactics. Sneaker males also had high expression in ionotropic glutamate receptor genes, specifically AMPA receptors, which may be important for increased working spatial memory while attempting to cuckold parental males at their nests. Larger differences in gene expression also occurred among male tactics than between males and females. We found significant expression differences in several candidate genes that were previously identified in other species with ARTs and suggest a previously undescribed role for cAMP-responsive element modulator (crem) in influencing parental male behaviors during spawning.",

    "abstract": "Experimental measurements require calibration to transform measured signals into physically meaningful values. The conventional approach has two steps: the experimenter deduces a conversion function using measurements on standards and then calibrates (or normalizes) measurements on unknown samples with this function. The deduction of the conversion function from only the standard measurements causes the results to be quite sensitive to experimental noise. It also implies that any data collected without reliable standards must be discarded. Here we show that a new \\\"1-step calibration method\\\" reduces these problems for the common situation in which samples are measured in batches, where a batch could be an immunoblot (Western blot), an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), a sequence of spectra, or a microarray, provided that some sample measurements are replicated across multiple batches. The 1-step method computes all calibration results iteratively from all measurements. It returns the most probable values for the sample compositions under the assumptions of a statistical model, making them the maximum likelihood predictors. It is less sensitive to measurement error on standards and enables use of some batches that do not include standards. In direct comparison of both real and simulated immunoblot data, the 1-step method consistently exhibited smaller errors than the conventional \\\"2-step\\\" method. These results suggest that the 1-step method is likely to be most useful for cases where experimenters want to analyze existing data that are missing some standard measurements and where experimenters want to extract the best results possible from their data. Simple open source software for both methods is available for download or on-line use.\\n\\nAuthor SummaryMost quantitative measurements do not return the physical quantities that are of interest, but some instrument-specific response value instead. These measurements are then converted to physical quantities through a conversion function, which the experimenter deduces from instrument responses for one or more standard samples of known composition. This is called calibration or normalization. For example, we recently performed quantitative immunoblotting on a large number of samples, each replicated on multiple blots, and then calibrated the measurements to yield protein concentrations relative to those in a standard sample. We found that the conventional calibration approach of treating the samples in each blot independently of the samples in other blots produced inaccurate results because this approach is completely dependent on the standard measurements, which were sometimes missing or erroneous in our data. Thus, we developed a new calibration approach in which we fit a statistical model to the entire data set simultaneously. This method, which applies to a very wide range of calibration problems, was substantially more accurate during validation tests and can be shown to return the most accurate results possible within the assumptions of the model. It is particularly useful when some standard measurements are missing from data sets or when experimenters want the best possible results.",

    "abstract": "Adaptation of pest species to laboratory conditions and selection for resistance to toxins in the laboratory are expected to cause inbreeding and genetic bottlenecks that reduce genetic variation. Heliothis virescens, a major cotton pest, has been colonized in the laboratory many times, and a few laboratory colonies have been selected for Bt resistance. We developed 350 bp Double-Digest Restriction-site Associated DNA-sequencing (ddRAD-seq) molecular markers to examine and compare changes in genetic variation associated with laboratory adaptation, artificial selection, and inbreeding in this non-model insect species. We found that allelic and nucleotide diversity declined dramatically in laboratory-reared H. virescens as compared with field-collected populations. The declines were primarily due to the loss of low frequency alleles present in field-collected H. virescens. A further, albeit modest decline in genetic diversity was observed in a Bt-selected population. The greatest decline was seen in H. virescens that were sib-mated for 10 generations, where more than 80% of loci were fixed for a single allele. To determine which regions of the genome were resistant to fixation in our sib-mated line, we generated a dense intraspecific linkage map containing 3 PCR-based, and 659 ddRAD-seq markers. Markers that retained polymorphism were observed in small clusters spread over multiple linkage groups, but this clustering was not statistically significant. Here, we confirmed and extended the general expectations for reduced genetic diversity in laboratory colonies, provided tools for further genomic analyses, and produced highly homozygous genomic DNA for future whole genome sequencing of H. virescens.",

    "abstract": "The conservation of threatened species must be underpinned by phylogeographic knowledge in order to be effective. This need is epitomised by the freshwater fish Carassius carassius, which has recently undergone drastic declines across much of its European range. Restriction Site Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) is being increasingly used for such phylogeographic questions, however RADseq is expensive, and limitations on sample number must be weighed against the benefit of large numbers of markers. Such tradeoffs have predominantly been addressed using simulated data. Here we compare the results generated from microsatellites and RADseq to the phylogeography of C. carassius, to add real-data-informed perspectives to this important debate. These datasets, along with data from the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, agree on broad phylogeographic patterns; showing the existence of two previously unidentified C. carassius lineages in Europe. These lineages have been isolated for approximately 2.2-2.3 M years, and should arguably be considered as separate conservation units. RADseq recovered finer population structure and stronger patterns of IBD than microsatellites, despite including only 17.6% of samples (38% of populations and 52% of samples per population). RADseq was also used along with Approximate Bayesian Computation to show that the postglacial colonisation routes of C. carassius differ from the general patterns of freshwater fish in Europe, likely as a result of their distinctive ecology.",

    "abstract": "The extent of within-species genetic variation across the diversity of animal life is a fundamental but largely unexplored problem in ecology and evolution. The neutral theory of molecular evolution predicts that genetic variation scales positively with population size. However, the genetic diversity of mitochondrial DNA, a prominent marker used in DNA barcoding studies, shows very little variation across animal species. Here, we report an unprecedented case of extreme mitochondrial variation within natural populations of two species of chaetognaths (arrow worms). We determined that this diversity is composed of deep intraspecific mitochondrial lineages within single populations that could be as divergent as human and newt. This mitochondrial diversity is the highest ever reported in animals without evidence of cryptic speciation or allopatric divergence as supported by nuclear evidence. We sequenced 54 complete mitogenomes revealing gene order rearrangements between these intraspecific lineages. Such structural differences have never previously been reported within single species. We confirm that this divergence was not driven by positive selection, and conversely show that these lineages evolved under purifying selection, consistently with neutral expectations. Our findings question the generally accepted narrow range of genetic variation in animal mitochondria and argue for a reappraisal of DNA barcoding techniques. Furthermore, extreme levels of mitogenomic variation in chaetognaths challenge classical views regarding mitochondrial evolution and cytonuclear co-evolution.",
