    "abstract": "Recent technical advances have enabled recording of increasingly large populations of neural activity, even during natural, unstructured behavior. Deep sequential autoencoders are the current state-of-the-art for uncovering dynamics from these datasets. However, these highly complex models include many non-trainable hyperparameters (HPs) that are typically hand tuned with reference to supervisory information (e.g., behavioral data). This process is cumbersome and time consuming and biases model selection toward models with good representations of individual supervisory variables. Additionally, it cannot be applied to cognitive areas or unstructured tasks for which supervisory information is unavailable. Here we demonstrate AutoLFADS, an automated model-tuning framework that can characterize dynamics using only neural data, without the need for supervisory information. This enables inference of dynamics out-of-the-box in diverse brain areas and behaviors, which we demonstrate on several datasets: motor cortex during free-paced reaching, somatosensory cortex during reaching with perturbations, and dorsomedial frontal cortex during cognitive timing tasks. We also provide a cloud software package and comprehensive tutorials that enable new users to apply the method without dedicated computing resources.",

    "abstract": "Lower family income during childhood is related to increased rates of adolescent depression, though the specific mechanisms are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that individuals with depression demonstrate hypoactivation in brain regions involved in reward learning and decision-making processes (e.g., portions of the prefrontal cortex). Separately, lower family income has been associated with neural alterations in similar regions. We examined associations between family income, depression, and brain activity during a reward learning and decision-making fMRI task in a sample of adolescents (full n=94; usable n=78; mean age=15.4 years). We identified neural regions representing 1) expected value (EV), the learned subjective value of an object, and 2) prediction error, the difference between EV and the actual outcome received. Regions of interest related to reward learning were examined in connection to childhood family income and parent-reported adolescent depressive symptoms. As hypothesized, lower activity in the subgenual anterior cingulate (sACC) for EV in response to approach stimuli was associated with lower childhood family income, as well as greater symptoms of depression measured one-year after the neuroimaging session. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that lower early family income leads to disruptions in reward and decision-making brain circuitry, which leads to adolescent depression.",

    "abstract": "Several enteric pathogens can gain specific metabolic advantages over other members of the microbiota by inducing host pathology and inflammation. The pathogen Clostridium difficile (Cd) is responsible for a toxin-mediated colitis that causes 15,000 deaths in the U.S. yearly1, yet the molecular mechanisms by which Cd benefits from toxin-induced colitis remain understudied. Up to 21% of healthy adults are asymptomatic carriers of toxigenic Cd2, indicating that Cd can persist as part of a healthy microbiota; antibiotic-induced perturbation of the gut ecosystem is associated with transition to toxin-mediated disease. To understand how Cd metabolism adapts from a healthy gut to the inflamed conditions its toxins induce, we used RNA-seq to define the metabolic state of wild-type Cd versus an isogenic mutant lacking toxins in a mouse model. Combining bacterial and mouse genetics, we demonstrate that Cd utilizes sorbitol derived from both diet and host. Host-derived sorbitol is produced by the enzyme aldose reductase, which is expressed by diverse immune cells and is upregulated during inflammation, including during Cd toxin-mediated disease. This work highlights a mechanism by which Cd can utilize a host-derived nutrient generated during toxin-induced disease by an enzyme not previously associated with infection.",

Despite being rare, MRSA-UTI are prone to potentially life-threatening exacerbations such as bacteremia that can be refractory to routine antibiotic therapy. Hence, MRSA-UTI is an important of research topic. To delineate molecular mechanisms governing MRSA urinary pathogenesis, we exposed three S. aureus strains, of which two were MRSA, to human urine and analyzed virulence characteristics and gene expression. We also analyzed MRSA-1369 transcriptome following cultivation in human urine for 2h. Our results reveal that human urine induces global changes in MRSA transcriptome, marked by changes in genes encoding proteins involved in metabolic pathways, virulence, and transcriptional regulators. In addition, in vitro assays also showed that human urine alters, in a strain-specific manner, adherence to human bladder epithelial cells and fibronectin, hemolysis of sheep RBCs, and surface hydrophobicity. In summary, our results provide first important insights into how the urine may specifically alter MRSA physiology in turn facilitating MRSA survival in the nutrient-limiting and hostile urinary microenvironment.\n\nImportanceMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an uncommon cause of urinary tract infections (UTI) in the general population. However, it is important to understand MRSA pathophysiology in the urinary tract because isolation of MRSA in urine samples is often secondary to potentially life-threatening MRSA bacteremia. In this report, we describe that cultivation in human urine alters MRSA global gene expression and virulence. We hypothesize that these alterations may aid MRSA adapt to the nutrient-limiting, immunologically hostile conditions within the urinary tract.",

    "abstract": "Translating genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex disease into mechanistic insight requires a comprehensive understanding of risk variant effects on disease-relevant cell types. To uncover cell type-specific mechanisms of type 1 diabetes (T1D) risk, we combined genetic association mapping and single cell epigenomics. We performed the largest to-date GWAS of T1D in 489,679 samples imputed into 59.2M variants, which identified 74 novel association signals including several large-effect rare variants. Fine-mapping of 141 total signals substantially improved resolution of causal variant credible sets, which primarily mapped to non-coding sequence. To annotate cell type-specific regulatory mechanisms of T1D risk variants, we mapped 448,142 candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) in pancreas and peripheral blood mononuclear cell types using snATAC-seq of 131,554 nuclei. T1D risk variants were enriched in cCREs active in CD4+ T cells as well as several additional cell types including pancreatic exocrine acinar and ductal cells. High-probability T1D risk variants at multiple signals mapped to exocrine-specific cCREs including novel loci near CEL, GP2 and CFTR. At the CFTR locus, the likely causal variant rs7795896 mapped in a ductal-specific distal cCRE which regulated CFTR and the risk allele reduced transcription factor binding, enhancer activity and CFTR expression in ductal cells. These findings support a role for the exocrine pancreas in T1D pathogenesis and highlight the power of combining large-scale GWAS and single cell epigenomics to provide insight into the cellular origins of complex disease.",

    "abstract": "The human brain grows the most dramatically during the perinatal and early postnatal periods, during which preterm birth or perinatal injury that may alter brain structure and lead to developmental anomalies. Thus, characterizing cortical thickness of developing brains remains an important goal. However, this task is often complicated by inaccurate cortical surface extraction due to small-size brains. Here, we propose a novel complex framework for the reconstruction of neonatal WM and pial surfaces, accounting for large partial volumes due to small-size brains. The proposed approach relies only on T1-weighted images unlike previous T2-weighted image-based approaches while only T1-weighted images are sometimes available under the different clinical/research setting. Deep neural networks are first introduced to the neonatal MRI pipeline to address the mis-segmentation of brain tissues. Furthermore, this pipeline enhances cortical boundary delineation using combined models of the CSF/GM boundary detection with edge gradient information and a new skeletonization of sulcal folding where no CSF voxels are seen due to the limited resolution. We also proposed a systematic evaluation using three independent datasets comprising 736 preterm and 97 term neonates. Qualitative assessment for reconstructed cortical surfaces shows that 86.9% are rated as accurate across the three site datasets. In addition, our landmark-based evaluation shows that the mean displacement of the cortical surfaces from the true boundaries was less than a voxel size (0.532{+/-}0.035mm). Evaluating the proposed pipeline (namely NEOCIVET 2.0) shows the robustness and reproducibility across different sites and different age-groups. The mean cortical thickness measured positively correlated with postmenstrual age (PMA) at scan (p<0.0001); Cingulate cortical areas grew the most rapidly whereas the inferior temporal cortex grew the least rapidly. The range of the cortical thickness measured was biologically congruent (1.3mm at 28 weeks of PMA to 1.8mm at term equivalent). Cortical thickness measured on T1 MRI using NEOCIVET 2.0 was compared with that on T2 using the established dHCP pipeline. It was difficult to conclude that either T1 or T2 imaging is more ideal to construct cortical surfaces. NEOCIVET 2.0 has been open to the public through CBRAIN (https://mcin-cnim.ca/technology/cbrain/), a web-based platform for processing brain imaging data.",

This approach enabled us to cover genes less mentioned in literature and revealed novel functional relationships among genes.

They were ectopically expressed in tobacco to assess their ability to induce epidermal cell outgrowth. Endogenous expression patterns were examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR at different stages of floral development relative to the development of anther trichomes. We report variation in the degree of epidermal cell outgrowth produced in transgenic tobacco for each ectopically expressed gene. Based on expression profile and ectopic activity, SlMIXTA-2 is likely involved in the production of leaf trichomes while SlMYB17-2 is the best candidate for the regulation of the anther trichome mesh.

    "abstract": "Learning from error is often a slow process. To accelerate learning, previous motor adaptation studies have focused on explicit factors such as reward or punishment, but the results have been inconsistent. Here, we considered the idea that a movement error carries an implicit cost for the organism because the act of correcting for error consumes time and energy. If this implicit cost could be modulated, it may robustly alter how the brain learns from error. To vary the cost of error, we considered a simple saccade adaptation task but combined it with motion discrimination: movement errors resulted in corrective saccades, but those corrections took time away from acquiring information in the discrimination task. We then modulated error cost using coherence of the discrimination task and found that when error cost was large, pupil diameter increased, and the brain learned more from error. However, when error cost was small, the pupil constricted, and the brain learned less from the same error. Thus, during sensorimotor adaptation, the act of correcting for error carried an implicit cost for the brain. Modulating this cost affects how the brain learns from error.",

    "abstract": "Culex quinquefasciatus Say is a brown, medium sized mosquito distributed widely in both tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is a night-active, opportunistic blood-feeder and is responsible for vectoring many animal and human diseases, including West Nile Virus and avian malaria. Current vector control methods (e.g. physical / chemical) are increasingly ineffective; use of insecticides also imposes some hazards to both human and ecosystem health. Recent advances in genome editing have allowed the development of genetic methods of insect control, which is species-specific and, theoretically, highly effective. CRISPR/Cas9 is a bacteria-derived programmable gene editing tool that has been shown to be functional in a range of species. We demonstrate here, the first successful germline gene knock-in by homology dependent repair in C. quinquefasciatus. Using CRISPR/Cas9, we integrated exogenous sequence comprising a sgRNA expression cassette and marker gene encoding a fluorescent protein fluorophore (Hr5/IE1-DsRed, Cq7SK-sgRNA) into the kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (kmo) gene. We achieved a minimum transformation rate of 2.8% similar to rates achieved in other mosquito species. Precise knock-in at the intended locus was confirmed by sequencing. Insertion homozygotes displayed a white eye phenotype in early-mid stage larvae and a recessive lethal phenotype by pupation. This work shows an alternative and efficient method for genetic engineering of C. quinquefasciatus, providing a new tool for researchers interested in developing genetic control tools for this vector.",

The accumulating amount of datasets has enabled the development of data-driven computational methods, especially the machine learning based methods, to address the molecular property prediction tasks. Due to the high cost of obtaining experimental labels, the datasets of individual tasks generally contain limited amount of data, which inspired the application of transfer learning to boost the performance of the molecular property prediction tasks. Our analyses revealed that simultaneously considering similar tasks, rather than randomly chosen ones, can significantly improve the performance of transfer learning in this field. To provide accurate estimation of task similarity, we proposed an effective and interpretable computational tool, named Molecular Tasks Similarity Estimator (MoTSE). By extracting task-related local and global knowledge from pretrained graph neural networks (GNNs), MoTSE projects individual tasks into a latent space and measures the distance between the embedded vectors to derive the task similarity estimation and thus enhance the molecular prediction results. We have validated that the task similarity estimated by MoTSE can serve as a useful guidance to design a more accurate transfer learning strategy for molecular property prediction. Experimental results showed that such a strategy greatly outperformed baseline methods including training from scratch and multitask learning. Moreover, MoTSE can provide interpretability for the estimated task similarity, through visualizing the important loci in the molecules attributed by the attribution method employed in MoTSE. In summary, MoTSE can provide an accurate method for estimating the molecular property task similarity for effective transfer learning, with good interpretability for the learned chemical or biological insights underlying the intrinsic principles of the task similarity.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDeficits in social cognition consistently underlie functional disabilities in a wide range of psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that the anterior insula is a  common core brain region that is impaired across neurological and psychiatric disorders, which include social cognition deficits. Nevertheless, neurobiological mechanisms of the anterior insula for social cognition remain elusive.\n\nMethodsTo determine the role of anterior insula in social cognition, we manipulated expression of Cyp26B1, an anterior insula-enriched molecule that is crucial for retinoic acid degradation and involved in the pathology of neuropsychiatric conditions. Social cognition was mainly assayed using the three-chamber social interaction test. We conducted multimodal analyses at the molecular, cellular, circuitry, and behavioral levels.\n\nResultsAt the molecular/cellular level, anterior insula-mediated social novelty recognition is maintained by proper activity of the layer 5 pyramidal neurons, for which retinoic acid-mediated gene transcription can play a role. We also demonstrate that oxytocin influences the anterior insula-mediated social novelty recognition, not by direct projection of oxytocin neurons, nor by direct diffusion of oxytocin to the anterior insula, which contrasts the modes of oxytocin regulation onto the posterior insula. Instead, oxytocin affects oxytocin receptor-expressing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus where serotonergic neurons are projected to the anterior insula. Furthermore, we show that serotonin 5HT2C receptor expressed in the anterior insula influences social novelty recognition.\n\nConclusionsAnterior insula plays a pivotal role in social novelty recognition that is partly regulated by a local retinoic acid cascade, but also remotely regulated by oxytocin via a non-classic mechanism.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionVarious CT severity scores have already been described in literature since the start of this pandemic. One pertinent issue with all of the previously described severity scores is their relative challenging calculation and variance in inter-observer agreement. The severity score proposed in our study is relatively simpler, easier to calculate and apart from a trained radiologist, can easily be calculated even by physicians with good inter-observer agreement. Therefore, a rapid CT severity score calculation can give a clue to physician about possible clinical outcome without being dependent on radiologist who may not be readily available especially in third world countries.\n\nObjectiveThe objective of this study is to develop a simple CT severity score (CT-SS) with good inter-observer agreement and access its correlation with clinical outcome.\n\nMethodsThis retrospective study was conducted by the Department of Radiology and Internal Medicine, at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi, from April 2020 to August 2020. Non-probability consecutive sampling was used to include all patients who were positive for COVID-19 on PCR, and underwent CT chest examination at AKUH. Severity of disease was calculated in each lobe on the basis of following proposed CT severity scoring system (CT-SS). For each lobe the percentage of involvement by disease was scored - 0% involvement was scored 0, <50% involvement was scored 1 and >50% involvement was scored 2. Maximum score for one lobe was 2 and hence total maximum overall score for all lobes was 10. Continuous data was represented using mean and standard deviation, and compared using independent sample t-tests. Categorical data was represented using frequencies and percentages, and compared using Chi-squared tests. Inter-observer reliability between radiologist and COVID intensivist for the 10 point CT-SS rated on 0-10 was assessed using the Kappa statistic. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant for all analyses.\n\nResultsA total of 73 patients were included, the majority male (58.9%) with mean age 55.8 {+/-} 13.93 years. The CT-SS rated on 0-10 showed substantial inter-observer reliability between radiologist and intensivist with a Kappa statistic of 0.78. Patients with CT-SS 8-10 had a significantly higher ICU admission & intubation rate (53.8% vs. 23.5%) and mortality rate (35.9% vs. 11.8%; p = 0.017), as compared to those with CT-SS 0-7.\n\nConclusionWe conclude that the described CT severity score (CT-SS) is a quick, effective and easily reproducible tool for prediction of adverse clinical outcome in patients with COVID 19 pneumonia. The tool shows good inter-observer agreement when calculated by radiologist and physician independently.",

    "abstract": "A functional benefit of attention is to proactively enhance perceptual sensitivity in space and time. Although attentional orienting has traditionally been associated with cortico-thalamic networks, recent evidence has shown that individuals with cerebellar degeneration (CD) show a reduced reaction time benefit from cues that enable temporal anticipation. While this deficit may reflect impairment in anticipatory motor preparation, it could also arise from cerebellar contribution to attentional modulation in time of perceptual sensitivity. To examine this, we tested CD participants on a non-speeded, challenging perceptual discrimination task, asking if they benefit from temporal cues. Strikingly, the CD group showed no duration-specific perceptual sensitivity benefit when cued by repeated but aperiodic presentation of the target interval. In contrast, they performed similar to controls when cued by a rhythmic stream. This dissociation further specifies the functional domain of the cerebellum and establishes its role in the attentional adjustment of perceptual sensitivity in time.",

    "abstract": "Learning-induced neuroplastic changes, further modulated by content and setting, are mirrored in brain functional connectivity (FC). In animal models, serotonergic agents were shown to facilitate neuroplasticity. This is especially prominent during emotional relearning, such as fear extinction, which may translate to clinical improvements in human patients. To investigate this assumption, 99 healthy subjects underwent six weeks of emotional or non-emotional learning and subsequent relearning. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed before and after the learning phases to investigate changes in FC. During relearning, subjects received either a daily dose of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) escitalopram or placebo. Escitalopram intake modulated FC changes in a network comprising Brocas area, the medial prefrontal cortex, the right inferior temporal and left lingual gyrus. More specifically, escitalopram increased the bidirectional connectivity between medial prefrontal cortex and lingual gyrus for non-emotional and additionally the connectivity from medial prefrontal cortex to Brocas area for emotional relearning. The context-dependence of these effects supports the assumption that SSRIs in clinical practice might improve neuroplasticity rather than psychiatric symptoms per se. Correlations with learning behavior further point towards a relationship with extinction processes in relearning. These results demonstrate that escitalopram intake during relearning results in content-dependent network adaptations and support the conclusion that enhanced neuroplasticity might be the major underlying mechanism also in humans. Beyond expanding the complexities of learning, these findings emphasize the influence of external factors on serotonin-facilitated neuroplasticity of the human brain.",

Atypical thalamocortical functional connectivity frequently observed in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) might therefore be linked to sensory and sleep problems common in ASD. Here we investigated the relationship between auditory-thalamic functional connectivity measured during natural sleep fMRI, sleep problems, and sound sensitivities in 70 toddlers and preschoolers (1.5 to 5-year-olds) with ASD compared to a matched group of 46 typically developing (TD) children. In children with ASD, sleep problems and sensory sensitivities were positively correlated, and increased sleep latency was associated with overconnectivity between the thalamus and auditory cortex in a subsample with high quality MRI data (n=29). Additionally, auditory cortex BOLD signal amplitude was elevated in children with ASD, potentially reflecting reduced sensory gating or a lack of auditory habituation during natural sleep. These findings indicate that atypical thalamocortical functional connectivity can be detected early in development and may play a crucial role in sleep problems and sensory sensitivities in ASD.",

    "abstract": "Mammary organoid (MaO) models are only available for a few traditional model organisms, limiting our ability to investigate mammary gland development and cancer across the diverse taxa of mammals. For example, horses are mammals with a similar mammary anatomy and function as humans, but they have a remarkably low incidence of mammary cancer, making the development of MaOs in non-traditional model organisms attractive, particularly in comparative cancer research. This study established equine mammary organoids (EqMaOs) from mammary gland tissue fragments and evaluated parameters including diameter, budding, and growth stage in non-budding EqMaOs, in cultures with increasing concentrations of epidermal growth factor (EGF), a key growth factor implicated in mammary gland development. Our findings showed that EqMaO diameter is not influenced by EGF concentration, whereas number of EqMaOs with budding and stage in non-budding EqMaOs are positively influenced by increasing EGF concentration. EqMaOs also formed protrusions with putative functions, including organoid fusion and sensory functions. We further characterized EqMaOs by the presence of myoepithelial and luminal cells using immunohistochemistry and used the hormone prolactin to stimulate milk secretion, as illustrated by {beta}-lactoglobulin expression, in these EqMaOs. Additionally, we showed that our method to establish MaOs is widely applicable to additional non-traditional mammalian model organisms such as cat, pig, deer, rabbit, and prairie vole. Collectively, MaO models across species will be a useful tool for comparative developmental and cancer studies.\n\nSummary statementMammary organoids can be established from various mammals by embedding mammary tissue fragments into a 3D matrix, providing a high-throughput, physiologically accurate model for comparative studies centered on mammary gland development and cancer.",

    "abstract": "Macrotermitine termites have domesticated fungi in the genus Termitomyces as their primary food source using pre-digested plant biomass. To access the full nutritional value of lignin-enriched plant biomass, the termite-fungus symbiosis requires the depolymerization of this complex phenolic polymer. While most previous work suggests that lignocellulose degradation is accomplished predominantly by the fungal cultivar, our current understanding of the underlying biomolecular mechanisms remains rudimentary. Here, we provide conclusive OMICs and activity-based evidence that Termitomyces partially depolymerizes lignocellulose through the combined actions of high-redox potential oxidizing enzymes (laccases, aryl-alcohol oxidases and a manganese peroxidase), the production of extracellular H2O2 and Fenton-based oxidative degradation, which is catalyzed by a newly described 2-methoxybenzoquinone/hydroquinone redox shuttle system and mediated by secreted chelating dicarboxylic acids. In combination, our approaches reveal a comprehensive depiction of how the efficient biomass degradation mechanism in this ancient insect agricultural symbiosis is accomplished through a combination of white- and brown-rot mechanisms.\n\nImportanceFungus-growing termites have perfected the decomposition of recalcitrant plant biomass to access valuable nutrients by engaging in a tripartite symbiosis with complementary contributions from a fungal mutualist and a co-diversified gut microbiome. This complex symbiotic interplay makes them one of the most successful and important decomposers for carbon cycling in Old World ecosystems. To date, most research has focused on the enzymatic contributions of microbial partners to carbohydrate decomposition. Here we provide genomic, transcriptomic and enzymatic evidence that Termitomyces also employs redox mechanisms, including diverse ligninolytic enzymes and a Fenton-based hydroquinone-catalyzed lignin-degradation mechanism, to break down lignin-rich plant material. Insights into these efficient decomposition mechanisms open new sources of efficient ligninolytic agents applicable for energy generation from renewable sources.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of the cellular metabolism is now recognized as a crucial mechanism for the homeostasis of innate and adaptive immune cells upon diverse extracellular stimuli. Macrophages, for instance, increase glycolysis upon stimulation with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Conceivably, pathogens also counteract these metabolic changes for their own survival in the host. However, despite this dynamic interplay in host-pathogen interactions, the role of immunometabolism in the context of intracellular bacterial infections is still unclear. Here, employing unbiased metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches, we investigated the role of metabolic adaptations of macrophages upon Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) infections. Importantly, our results suggested that S. Typhimurium abrogates glycolysis and its modulators such as insulin-signaling to impair macrophage defense. Mechanistically, glycolytic enzyme aldolase A is critical for v-ATPase assembly and the acidification of phagosomes upon S. Typhimurium infection, and impairment in the glycolytic machinery eventually leads to decreased bacterial clearance and antigen presentation in macrophages. Collectively, our results highlight a vital molecular link between metabolic adaptation and phagosome maturation in macrophages, which is targeted by S. Typhimurium to evade cell-autonomous defense.",

    "abstract": "In this study we merged methods from machine learning and human neuroimaging to causally test the role of self-induced affect processing states in biasing the affect processing of subsequent image stimuli. To test this causal relationship we developed a novel paradigm in which (n=40) healthy adult participants observed affective neural decodings of their real-time functional magnetic resonance image (rtfMRI) responses as feedback to guide explicit regulation of their brain (and corollary affect processing) state towards a positive valence goal state. By this method individual differences in affect regulation ability were controlled. Attaining this brain-affect goal state triggered the presentation of pseudo-randomly selected affectively congruent (positive valence) or incongruent (negative valence) image stimuli drawn from the International Affective Picture Set. Separately, subjects passively viewed randomly triggered positively and negatively valent image stimuli during fMRI acquisition. Multivariate neural decodings of the affect processing induced by these stimuli were modeled using the task trial type (state- versus randomly-triggered) as the fixed-effect of a general linear mixed-effects model. Random effects were modeled subject-wise. We found that self-induction of a positive valence brain state significantly positively biased valence processing of subsequent stimuli. As a manipulation check, we validated affect processing state induction achieved by the image stimuli using independent psychophysiological response measures of hedonic valence and autonomic arousal. We also validated the predictive fidelity of the trained neural decoding models using brain states induced by an out-of-sample set of image stimuli. Beyond its contribution to our understanding of the neural mechanisms that bias affect processing this work demonstrated the viability of novel experimental paradigms triggered by pre-defined cognitive states. This line of individual differences research potentially provides neuroimaging scientists with a valuable tool for causal exploration of the roles and identities of intrinsic cognitive processing mechanisms that shape our perceptual processing of sensory stimuli.",

    "abstract": "The urinary microbiota is the collection of microbes present in urine that play a role in host health. Studies of urine microbiota have traditionally relied upon culturing methods aimed at identifying pathogens. However, recent culture-free sequencing studies of the urine microbiota have determined that a diverse array of microbes are present in health and disease. To study these microbes and their potential role in diseases like bladder cancer or interstitial cystitis, consistent extraction and detection of microbial DNA from urine is critical. However, urine is a low biomass substrate, requiring sensitive methods to capture DNA and making the risk of contamination high. To address this challenge, we collected urine samples from ten healthy dogs and extracted DNA from each sample using five different commercially available extraction methods. Extraction methods were compared based on total and bacterial DNA concentrations and microbial community composition and diversity assessed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Significant differences in the urinary microbiota were observed by dog and sex but not extraction method. The Bacteremia kit yielded the highest total DNA concentrations (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.165, not significant) and the highest bacterial DNA concentrations (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.044). Bacteremia also extracted bacterial DNA from the greatest number of samples. Taken together, these results suggest that the Bacteremia kit is an effective option for studying the urine microbiota. This work lays the foundation to study the urine microbiome in a wide range of urogenital diseases in dogs and other species.\n\nHighlightsO_LICanine urine microbiota differed by sex and dog but not extraction method.\nC_LIO_LIQiagen Bacteremia kit yielded the highest bacterial DNA concentrations from urine.\nC_LIO_LIThe Bacteremia kit extracted bacterial DNA from the greatest number of samples.\nC_LIO_LIAbsolute abundance of Sphingomonas species increased in female dog urine.\nC_LIO_LIPasteurellaceae bacterium canine oral taxon 272 increased in male dog urine.\nC_LI",

The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet to be documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in preventing and treating severe cases of COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its D614G mutant. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, therefore would be more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G mutant. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently published CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating  off-the-shelf S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have illuminated the importance of several key signaling pathways in regulating the dynamic surveillance and phagocytic activity of microglia. Yet little is known about how these signals result in the assembly of phagolysosomal machinery near targets of phagocytosis, especially in processes distal from the microglial soma. Neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes locally regulate protein translation within distal processes. Therefore, we tested whether there is regulated local translation within peripheral microglia processes (PeMPs). We show that PeMPs contain ribosomes which engage in de novo protein synthesis, and these associate with a subpool of transcripts involved in pathogen defense, motility, and phagocytosis. Using a live slice preparation, we further show that acute translation blockade impairs the formation of PeMP phagocytic cups, the localization of lysosomal proteins within them, and phagocytosis. Collectively, these data argue for a regulated local translation in PeMPs and indicate a need for new translation to support dynamic microglial function.",

    "abstract": "While blood transfusion is an essential cornerstone of hematological care, patients that require repetitive transfusion remain at persistent risk of alloimmunization due to the diversity of human blood group polymorphisms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is an effective means of identifying genotypic and phenotypic variations among the blood groups, while the accurate interpretation of such NGS data is currently hampered by a lack of accessibility to bioinformatics support. To address this unmet need, we have developed the RBCeq (https://www.rbceq.org/) platform, which consists of a novel bioinformatics algorithm coupled with a user-friendly web server capable of comprehensively delineating different blood group variants from genomics data with advanced visualization of results. The software profiles genomic data for 36 blood group systems, including two transcription factors and can identify small genetic alterations, including small indels and copy number variants. The RBCeq algorithm was validated on 403 samples which include 58 complex serology cases from Australian Red Cross LifeBlood, 100 samples from The MedSeq Project (phs000958) and a further 245 from Indigenous Australian participants. The final blood typing data from RBCeq was 99.83% concordant for 403 samples (85 different antigens in 21 blood group systems) with that listed from the International Society for Blood Transfusion database.",

    "abstract": "The advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies has revolutionized transcriptomic studies. However, large-scale integrative analysis of scRNA-seq data remains a challenge largely due to unwanted batch effects and the limited transferabilty, interpretability, and scalability of the existing computational methods. We present single-cell Embedded Topic Model (scETM). Our key contribution is the utilization of a transferable neural-network-based encoder while having an interpretable linear decoder via a matrix tri-factorization. In particular, scETM simultaneously learns an encoder network to infer cell type mixture and a set of highly interpretable gene embeddings, topic embeddings, and batch effect linear intercepts from multiple scRNA-seq datasets. scETM is scalable to over 106 cells and confers remarkable cross-tissue and cross-species zero-shot transfer-learning performance. Using gene set enrichment analysis, we find that scETM-learned topics are enriched in biologically meaningful and disease-related pathways. Lastly, scETM enables the incorporation of known gene sets into the gene embeddings, thereby directly learning the associations between pathways and topics via the topic embeddings.",

    "abstract": "Several neuroimaging studies have shown the somatotopy of body part representations in primary somatosensory cortex (S1), but the functional hierarchy of distinct subregions in human S1 has not been adequately addressed. The current study investigates the functional hierarchy of cyto-architectonically distinct regions, Brodmann areas BA3, BA1, and BA2, in human S1. During functional MRI experiments, we presented participants with vibrotactile stimulation of the fingertips at 3 different vibration frequencies. Using population Receptive Field (pRF) modeling of the fMRI BOLD activity, we identified the hand region in S1 and the somatotopy of the fingertips. For each voxel, the pRF center indicates the finger that most effectively drives the BOLD signal, and the pRF size measures the spatial somatic pooling of fingertips. We find a systematic relationship of pRF sizes from lower-order areas to higher-order areas. Specifically, we found that pRF sizes are smallest in BA3, increase slightly towards BA1, and are largest in BA2, paralleling the increase in visual receptive field size as one ascends the visual hierarchy. Additionally, we find that the time-to-peak of the hemodynamic response in BA3 is roughly 0.5s earlier compared to BA1 and BA2, further supporting the notion of a functional hierarchy of subregions in S1. These results were obtained during stimulation of different mechanoreceptors, suggesting that different afferent fibers leading up to S1 feed into the same cortical hierarchy.",
