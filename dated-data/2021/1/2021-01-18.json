    "abstract": "Successful models of movement should encompass the flexibility of the human motor system to execute movements under different contexts. One such context-dependent modulation is proactive inhibition, a type of behavioural inhibition concerned with responding with restraint. Whilst movement has classically been modelled as a rise-to-threshold process, there exists a lack of empirical evidence for this in limb movements. Alternatively, the dynamical systems view conceptualises activity during motor preparation as setting the initial state of a dynamical system, that evolves into the movement upon receipt of a trigger. We tested these models by measuring how proactive inhibition influenced movement preparation and execution in humans. We changed the orientation (PA: postero-anterior and AP: antero-posterior flowing currents) and pulse width (120 s and 30 s) of motor cortex transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe different corticospinal interneuron circuits. PA and AP interneuron circuits represent the dimensions of a state space upon which motor cortex activity unfolds during motor preparation and execution. AP30 inputs were inhibited at the go cue, regardless of proactive inhibition, whereas PA120 inputs scaled inversely with the probability of successful inhibition. When viewed through a rise-to-threshold model, proactive inhibition was implemented by delaying the trigger to move, suggesting that motor preparation and execution are independent. A dynamical systems perspective showed that proactive inhibition was marked by a shift in the distribution of interneuron networks (trajectories) during movement execution, despite normalisation for reaction time. Viewing data through the rise-to-threshold and dynamical systems models reveal complimentary mechanisms by which proactive inhibition is implemented.\n\nKey pointsO_LIWe view proactive inhibition through the rise-to-threshold and dynamical systems models.\nC_LIO_LIWe change the orientation (PA: postero-anterior and AP: antero-posterior flowing currents) and pulse width (120 s and 30 s) of transcranial magnetic stimulation to probe interneuron networks in motor cortex during behavioural tasks employing proactive inhibition.\nC_LIO_LIWhen viewed through a rise-to-threshold model, proactive inhibition was implemented by delaying the trigger to move, suggesting that motor preparation and execution are independent.\nC_LIO_LIA dynamical systems perspective showed that despite normalisation for reaction time, the trajectory/balance between PA120 and AP30 interneuron inputs during movement execution depended on proactive inhibition.\nC_LIO_LIViewing data through the rise-to-threshold and dynamical systems models reveal complimentary mechanisms by which proactive inhibition is implemented.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Trace element selenium (Se) is incorporated as the 21st amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), into selenoproteins through tRNA[Ser]Sec. Selenoproteins act as gatekeepers of redox homeostasis and modulate immune function to effect anti-inflammation and resolution. However, mechanistic underpinnings involving metabolic reprogramming during inflammation and resolution remain poorly understood. Bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation of murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) cultured in the presence or absence of Se (as selenite) was used to examine temporal changes in the proteome and metabolome by multiplexed tandem mass tag-quantitative proteomics, metabolomics, and machine-learning approaches. Kinetic deltagram and clustering analysis indicated addition of Se led to extensive reprogramming of cellular metabolism upon stimulation with LPS enhancing PPP, TCA cycle, and OXPHOS, to aid in the phenotypic transition towards alternatively activated macrophages, synonymous with resolution of inflammation. Remodeling of metabolic pathways and consequent metabolic adaptation towards pro-resolving phenotypes began with Se treatment at 0 h and became most prominent around 8 h post LPS stimulation that included succinate dehydrogenase complex (Sdh), pyruvate kinase (Pkm), and sedoheptulosekinase (Shpk). Se-dependent modulation of these pathways predisposed BMDMs to preferentially increase OXPHOS to efficiently regulate inflammation and its timely resolution. Use of macrophages lacking selenoproteins, indicated that all three metabolic nodes were sensitive to selenoproteome expression. Furthermore, inhibition of Sdh with dimethylmalonate affected the pro-resolving effects of Se by increasing the resolution interval in a murine peritonitis model. In summary, our studies provide novel insights into the role of cellular Se via metabolic reprograming to facilitate anti-inflammation and proresolution.",

    "abstract": "Our view of genome size in Archaea and Bacteria has remained skewed as the data used to paint its picture has been dominated by genomes of microorganisms that can be cultivated under laboratory settings. However, the continuous effort to catalog the genetic make-up of Earths microbiomes specifically propelled by recent extensive work on uncultivated microorganisms, provides a unique opportunity to revise our perspective on genome size distribution. Capitalizing on a recently released extensive catalog of tens of thousands of metagenome-assembled genomes, we provide a comprehensive overview of genome size distributions. We observe that the known phylogenetic diversity of environmental microorganisms possesses significantly smaller genomes than the collection of laboratory isolated microorganisms. Aquatic microorganisms average 3.1 Mb, host-associated microbial genomes average 3.0 Mb, terrestrial microorganism average 3.7 Mb and isolated microorganisms average 4.3 Mb. While the environment where the microorganisms live can certainly be linked to genome size, in some cases, evolutionary phylogenetic history can be a stronger predictor. Moreover, ecological strategies such as auxotrophies have a direct impact on genome size. To better understand the ecological drivers of genome size, we expand on the known and the overlooked factors that influence genome size in different environments, phylogenetic groups and trophic strategies.",

In this study, we analyzed the composition of small molecules in samples obtained from solid cultures of C. gattii by a combination of chromatographic and spectrometric approaches, and untargeted metabolomics. This analysis revealed previously unknown components of EVs, including small peptides with known biological functions in other models. The peptides found in C. gattii EVs had their chemical structure validated by chemical approaches and comparison with authentic standards, and their functions tested in a Galleria mellonella model of cryptococcal infection. One of the vesicular peptides (isoleucine-proline-isoleucine, Ile-Pro-Ile) improved the survival of G. mellonella lethally infected with C. gattii or C. neoformans. These results indicate that small molecules exported in EVs are biologically active in Cryptococcus. Our study is the first to characterize a fungal EV molecule inducing protection, pointing to an immunological potential of extracellular peptides produced by C. gattii.",

    "abstract": "Many birth defects are thought to arise from a multifactorial etiology; i.e., interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors. The Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway regulates myriad developmental processes, and pathway inhibition is associated with birth defects, including holoprosencephaly (HPE). Cannabinoids are HH pathway inhibitors, but little is known of their effects on HH-dependent processes in mammalian embryos, and their mechanism of action is unclear. We report here that the psychoactive cannabinoid {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) induces two hallmark HH loss-of-function phenotypes (HPE and ventral neural tube patterning defects) in Cdon mutant mice, which have a subthreshold deficit in HH signaling. THC therefore acts as a \"conditional teratogen\", dependent on a complementing but insufficient genetic insult. In vitro findings indicate that THC is a direct, albeit relatively weak, inhibitor of the essential HH pathway component, Smoothened. In contrast, the canonical THC receptor, cannabinoid receptor-type 1, is not required for THC to inhibit HH signaling. Cannabis consumption during pregnancy may contribute to the combination of risk factors underlying specific developmental disorders. These findings therefore have significant public health relevance.",

We speculate that the phenotypic heterogeneity is a result of different mechanisms to increase fitness. Cells with reduced insulin productivity have increased fitness by reducing the burden of the heterologous insulin production and the populations with reduced enzymatic capacity of the central carbon metabolism and pseudohyphal growth have increased fitness towards the glucose-limited conditions.\n\nThe results highlight the importance of considering population heterogeneity when studying adaptation and evolution.",

It extends GenomicRanges from the genome to the transcriptome and implements a framework that integrates data from several sources. ORFik streamlines the steps to process, analyze, and visualize the different steps of translation with a particular focus on initiation and elongation. It accepts high-throughput sequencing data from ribosome profiling to quantify ribosome elongation or RCP-seq/TCP-seq to also quantify ribosome scanning. In addition, ORFik can use CAGE data to accurately determine 5UTRs and RNA-seq for determining translation relative to RNA abundance. ORFik supports and calculates over 30 different translation-related features and metrics from the literature and can annotate translated regions such as proteins or upstream open reading frames. As a use-case, we demonstrate using ORFik to rapidly annotate the dynamics of 5 UTRs across different tissues, detect their uORFs, and characterize their scanning and translation in the downstream protein-coding regions.\n\n* Availabilityhttp://bioconductor.org/packages/ORFik",

    "abstract": "Fish ecosystems perform ecological functions that are critically important for the sustainability of marine ecosystems, such as global food security and carbon stock. During the 21st century, significant global warming caused by climate change has created pressing challenges for fish ecosystems that threaten species existence and global ecosystem health. Here, we study a coastal fish community in Maizuru Bay, Japan, and investigate the relationships between fluctuations of ST, abundance-based species interactions and salient fish biodiversity. Observations show that a local 20% increase in temperature from 2002 to 2014 underpins a long-term reduction in fish diversity ([~]25%) played out by some native and invasive species (e.g. Chinese wrasse) becoming exceedingly abundant; this causes a large decay in commercially valuable species (e.g. Japanese anchovy) coupled to an increase in ecological productivity. The fish community is analyzed considering five temperature ranges to understand its atemporal seasonal sensitivity to ST changes, and long-term trends. An optimal information flow model is used to reconstruct species interaction networks that emerge as topologically different for distinct temperature ranges and species dynamics. Networks for low temperatures are more scale-free compared to ones for intermediate (15-20{degrees}C) temperatures in which the fish ecosystem experiences a first-order phase transition in interactions from locally stable to metastable and globally unstable for high temperatures states as suggested by abundance-spectrum transitions. The dynamic dominant eigenvalue of species interactions shows increasing instability for competitive species (spiking in summer due to intermediate-season critical transitions) leading to enhanced community variability and critical slowing down despite higher time-point resilience. Native competitive species whose abundance is distributed more exponentially have the highest total directed interactions and are keystone species (e.g. Wrasse and Horse mackerel) for the most salient links with cooperative decaying species. Competitive species, with higher eco-climatic memory and synchronization, are the most affected by temperature and play an important role in maintaining fish ecosystem stability via multitrophic cascades (via cooperative-competitive species imbalance), and as bioindicators of change. More climate-fitted species follow temperature increase causing larger divergence divergence between competitive and cooperative species. Decreasing dominant eigenvalues and lower relative network optimality for warmer oceans indicate fishery more attracted toward persistent oscillatory states, yet unpredictable, with lower cooperation, diversity and fish stock despite the increase in community abundance due to non-commercial and venomous species. We emphasize how changes in species interaction organization, primarily affected by temperature fluctuations, are the backbone of biodiversity dynamics and yet for functional diversity in contrast to taxonomic richness. Abundance and richness manifest gradual shifts while interactions show sudden shift. The work provides data-driven tools for analyzing and monitoring fish ecosystems under the pressure of global warming or other stressors. Abundance and interaction patterns derived by network-based analyses proved useful to assess ecosystem susceptibility and effective change, and formulate predictive dynamic information for science-based fishery policy aimed to maintain marine ecosystems stable and sustainable.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of water transport via aquaporins is crucial for osmoregulation and water homeostasis of an organism. This transport of water is regulated either by gating or trafficking wherein AQPs are transported from intracellular storage sites to plasma membrane. It has been proposed that water movement via AQP2 is regulated by post-translational modification. We aimed to explore the structural and functional changes occurring in AQP2 due to Ser256 phosphorylation. We have carried out molecular dynamics simulations to investigate molecular basis of effect of phosphorylation on water permeability of AQP2. MD simulations show that there are mild variations in the pore sizes of different monomers of the phosphorylated and unphosphorylated AQP2. Analysis of inter and intra-monomeric interactions such as hydrogen bond, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions has been carried out. Structures of the phosphorylated AQP2 do not show any blocking of mouth of pore of the monomers during the course of MD simulations. Further, water permeability calculations do corroborate the above finding. This molecular dynamics study suggests that phosphorylation of C-terminal Ser-256 residue of AQP2 may not be directly responsible for gating mechanism.",

This study was conducted to compare postprandial plasma concentrations of insulin, energy related metabolites, and amino acids measured after a 6-week challenge consisting of exposure to good or poor hygiene of housing conditions of 24 growing pigs divergently selected for low-RFI (LRFI) and high-RFI (HRFI). Blood indicators of immune responses were assessed from samples collected before (week 0 or W0), and 3 (W3) and 6 weeks (W6) after pigs transfer to their respective housing hygiene conditions. Plasma haptoglobin concentrations and blood neutrophil granulocyte numbers were greater in poor than in good conditions at W3. Plasma concentrations of total immunoglobulin G were greater (p = 0.04) in poor than in good hygiene conditions at W6. At W6, pigs were fitted with an intravenous catheter for serial blood samplings. Low-RFI pigs had greater insulin (p < 0.001) and lower triglyceride (p = 0.04) average plasma concentrations than HRFI pigs in both conditions. In poor hygiene conditions, the peaks of insulin and glucose occured earlier and that of insulin was greater in LRFI than in HRFI pigs. Irrespective of genetic line, average plasma concentrations of histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, threonine, valine, and alanine were greater in poor compared with good conditions. Only HRFI pigs had greater lysine, asparagine, proline, and tyrosine plasma concentrations in poor than in good hygiene conditions. Conversely, arginine, tryptophan, proline, and tyrosine plasma concentrations were lower only for LRFI pigs housed in poor hygiene conditions. The impact of poor hygiene of housing conditions on insulin, triglycerides, and AA profiles differed between RFI lines. More specifically, our results suggest that, contrary to HRFI, LRFI pigs increased or maintained their utilization of Trp, Arg, and Lys when housed in poor hygiene conditions. This difference may contribute to the better capacity of LRFI to cope with the poor hygiene of housing conditions.",

    "abstract": "The post green revolution agriculture is based on generous application of fertilizers and high-yielding genotypes that are suited for such high input regimes. Cereals, like maize (Zea mays L.) are capable of utilizing less than 20% of the applied inorganic phosphate (Pi) - a non-renewable fertilizer resource. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the acquisition, transportation and utilization of Pi may lead to strategies to enhance phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) in field crops. In this study, we selected 12 Pi responsive genes in maize and carried out their comparative transcriptional expression in root and leaf tissues of a hydroponically grown Pi stress tolerant maize inbred line HKI-163, under sufficient and deficient Pi conditions. Pi starvation led to significant increase in root length; marked proliferation of root hairs and lesser number of crown roots. Eleven genes were significantly up or down regulated in Pi deficient condition. The putative acid phosphatase, ZmACP5, expression was up regulated by 162.81 and 74.40 fold in root and leaf tissues, respectively. The RNase, ZmRNS1 showed 115 fold up regulation in roots under Pi deprivation. Among the two putative high affinity Pi transporters ZmPht1;4 was found specific to root, whereas ZmPht2 was found to be up regulated in both root and leaf tissues. The genes involved in Pi homeostasis pathway (ZmSIZ1, SPX1 and Pho2) were up regulated in root and leaf. In light of the expression profiling of selected regulatory genes, an updated model of transcriptional regulation under Pi starvation in maize has been proposed.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEWe explored longitudinal trends in sociodemographic characteristics, reported symptoms, laboratory findings, pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment, comorbidities, and 30-day in-hospital mortality among hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nMETHODSThis retrospective cohort study included 43,267 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in the Veterans Health Administration between 03/01/20 and 08/31/20 and followed until 09/30/20. We focused our analysis on patients that were subsequently hospitalized, and categorized them into groups based on the month of hospitalization. We summarized our findings through descriptive statistics. We used a nonparametric rank-sum test for trend to examine any differences in the distribution of our study variables across the six months.\n\nRESULTSDuring our study period, 8,240 patients were hospitalized, and 1,081 (13.1%) died within 30 days of admission. Hospitalizations increased over time, but the proportion of patients that died consistently declined from March (N=221/890, 24.8%) to August (N=111/1,396, 8.0%). Patients hospitalized in March compared to August were younger on average, mostly black, and symptomatic. They also had a higher frequency of baseline comorbidities, including hypertension and diabetes, and were more likely to present with abnormal laboratory findings including low lymphocyte counts and elevated creatinine. Lastly, receipt of mechanical ventilation and Hydroxychloroquine declined from March to August, while treatment with Dexamethasone and Remdesivir increased.\n\nCONCLUSIONWe found evidence of declining COVID-19 severity and fatality over time within a national health care system.",

    "abstract": "Current theories of bilingualism disagree on the extent to which separate brain regions are used to maintain or process ones first and second language. The present study took a novel multivariate approach to address this question. We examined whether bilinguals maintain distinct neural representations of two languages; specifically, we tested whether brain areas that are involved in processing word meaning in either language are reliably representing each language differently, and whether language representation is influenced by individual differences in proficiency level and age of acquisition of L2. Thirty-one English-Mandarin bilingual adults performed a picture-word matching task in both languages. We then used representational similarity analysis to examine which brain regions reliably showed different patterns of activity for each language. As a group, there were no regions that reliably represented languages distinctly. However, both proficiency and age of acquisition predicted dissimilarity between language representations in several brain areas within the language network as well as several regions of the ventral visual pathway, demonstrating that top-down language knowledge and individual language experience shapes concept representation in the processing stream. The results support the model of an integrated language system in bilinguals, along with a novel description of how representations for each language change with proficiency level and L2 age of acquisition.",

    "abstract": "In the present study, we have used Focused Ion Beam/Scanning Electron Microscopy (FIB/SEM) to perform a study of the synaptic organization of layer III of Brodmanns area 21 in human tissue samples obtained from autopsies and biopsies. We analyzed the synaptic density, 3D spatial distribution, and type (asymmetric/symmetric), as well as the size and shape of each synaptic junction of 4945 synapses that were fully reconstructed in 3D. Significant differences in the mean synaptic density between autopsy and biopsy samples were found (0.49 and 0.66 synapses/m3, respectively). However, in both types of samples (autopsy and biopsy), the asymmetric:symmetric ratio was similar (93:7) and most asymmetric synapses were established on dendritic spines (75%), while most symmetric synapses were established on dendritic shafts (85%). We also compared several electron microscopy methods and analysis tools to estimate the synaptic density in the same brain tissue. We have shown that FIB/SEM is much more reliable and robust than the majority of the other commonly used EM techniques. The present work constitutes a detailed description of the synaptic organization of cortical layer III. Further studies on the rest of the cortical layers are necessary to better understand the functional organization of this temporal cortical region.",

    "abstract": "Huntingtons disease (HD) is the most common monogenic neurodegenerative disease and is fatal. CAG repeat expansions in mutant Huntingtin (mHTT) exon 1 encode for polyglutamine (polyQ) stretches and influence age of onset and disease severity, depending on their length. mHTT is more structured compared to wild-type (wt) HTT, resulting in a decreased N-terminal conformational flexibility. mHTT inflexibility may contribute to both gain of function toxicity, due to increased mHTT aggregation propensity, but also to loss of function phenotypes, due to decreased interactions with binding partners. High-throughput-screening techniques to identify mHTT flexibility states and potential flexibility modifying small molecules are currently lacking. Here, we propose a novel approach for identifying small molecules that restore mHTTs conformational flexibility in human patient fibroblasts. We applied an antibody-based time-resolved Forster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) immunoassay, measuring endogenous HTT flexibility using two validated HTT-specific antibodies. The ratio of TR-FRET signal at 4{degrees}C and 20{degrees}C differs between wtHTT and mHTT and allowed to perform a high-throughput screening using HTT flexibility as a read-out. We identified several small molecules that can partially rescue mHTT inflexibility, presumably by altering HTT post-translational modifications. This novel screening approach has the potential to identify previously unknown HD drugs and drug targets.",

    "abstract": "There is a growing body of research demonstrating that the cerebellum is involved in language understanding. Early theories assumed that the cerebellum is involved in low-level language processing. However, those theories are at odds with recent work demonstrating cerebellar activation during cognitive tasks. Using natural language stimuli and an encoding model framework, we performed an fMRI experiment where subjects passively listened to five hours of natural language stimuli which allowed us to analyze language processing in the cerebellum with higher precision than previous work. We used this data to fit voxelwise encoding models with five different feature spaces that span the hierarchy of language processing from acoustic input to high-level conceptual processing. Examining the prediction performance of these models on separate BOLD data shows that cerebellar responses to language are almost entirely explained by high-level conceptual language features rather than low-level acoustic or phonemic features. Additionally, we found that the cerebellum has a higher proportion of voxels that represent social semantic categories, which include \"social\" and \"people\" words, and lower representations of all other semantic categories, including \"mental\", \"concrete\", and \"place\" words, than cortex. This suggests that the cerebellum is representing language at a conceptual level with a preference for social information.\n\nSignificance StatementRecent work has demonstrated that, beyond its typical role in motor planning, the cerebellum is implicated in a wide variety of tasks including language. However, little is known about the language representations in the cerebellum, or how those representations compare to cortex. Using voxelwise encoding models and natural language fMRI data, we demonstrate here that language representations are significantly different in the cerebellum as compared to cortex. Cerebellum language representations are almost entirely semantic, and the cerebellum contains over-representation of social semantic information as compared to cortex. These results suggest that the cerebellum is not involved in language processing per se, but cognitive processing more generally.",

    "abstract": "Histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) is a major HDAC protein in the adult brain and has been shown to regulate many neuronal genes. Aberrant expression of HDAC2 and subsequent dysregulation of neuronal gene expression is implicated in neurodegeneration and brain aging. Human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons (hiPSC-Ns) are widely used models for studying neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, but the role of HDAC2 in hiPSC-N differentiation and maturation has not been explored. In this study, we show that levels of HDAC2 progressively decrease as hiPSCs are differentiated towards neurons. This suppression of HDAC2 inversely corresponds to an increase in neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1, a multifunctional protein involved in mitochondrial dynamics. Expression of neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1 is accompanied by concomitant expression of a neuron-specific alternative splicing factor, SRRM4. Manipulation of HDAC2 and Endophilin-B1 using lentiviral approaches shows that knock-down of HDAC2 or overexpression of a neuron-specific Endophilin-B1 isoform promotes mitochondrial elongation and protects against cytotoxic stress in hiPSC-Ns, while HDAC2 knock-down specifically influences genes regulating mitochondrial dynamics and synaptogenesis. Furthermore, HDAC2 knock-down promotes enhanced mitochondrial respiration and reduces levels of neurotoxic amyloid beta peptides. Collectively, our study demonstrates a role for HDAC2 in hiPSC-neuronal differentiation, highlights neuron-specific isoforms of Endophilin-B1 as a marker of differentiating hiPSC-Ns, and demonstrates that HDAC2 regulates key neuronal and mitochondrial pathways in hiPSC-Ns.",

    "abstract": "Periodontal disease is driven by dysbiosis of the oral microbiome, resulting in over-representation of species that induce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue-remodeling matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the periodontium. These chronic tissue-destructive inflammatory responses result in gradual loss of tooth-supporting alveolar bone. The oral spirochete Treponema denticola, is consistently found at significantly elevated levels in periodontal lesions. Host-expressed Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2) senses a variety of bacterial ligands, including acylated lipopolysaccharides and lipoproteins. T. denticola dentilisin, a surface-expressed protease complex comprised of three lipoproteins has been implicated as a virulence factor in periodontal disease, primarily due to its proteolytic activity. While the role of acylated bacterial components in induction of inflammation is well-studied, little attention has been given to the potential role of the acylated nature of dentilisin. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that T. denticola dentilisin activates a TLR2-dependent mechanism, leading to upregulation of tissue-destructive genes in periodontal tissue. RNA-sequencing of periodontal ligament cells challenged with T. denticola bacteria revealed a significant upregulation of genes associated with extracellular matrix organization and degradation, including tissue-specific inducible MMPs that may play novel roles in modulating host immune responses yet to be characterized within the context of oral disease. The Gram-negative oral commensal, Veillonella parvula, failed to upregulate these same MMPs. Dentilisin-induced upregulation of MMPs was mediated via TLR2 and MyD88 activation, since knockdown of either TLR2 or MyD88 abrogated these effects. Challenge with purified dentilisin upregulated the same MMPs, whereas a dentilisin-deficient T. denticola mutant had no effect. Finally, T. denticola-mediated activation of TLR2/MyD88 led to the nuclear translocation of the transcription factor Sp1, which was shown to be a critical regulator of all T. denticola-dependent MMP expression. Taken together, these data support that T. denticola dentilisin stimulates tissue-destructive cellular processes in a TLR2/MyD88/Sp1-dependent fashion.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPeriodontal disease is driven by dysbiosis of the oral microbiome, which interacts with host tissues and thereby induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue-remodeling matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), leading to destruction of the periodontal tissues. Even after clinical intervention, patients with severe periodontal disease are left with a persistent pro-inflammatory transcriptional profile throughout the periodontium. The oral spirochete, Treponema denticola, is consistently found at elevated levels in periodontal lesions and is associated with several pathophysiological effects driving periodontal disease progression. The T. denticola surface-expressed protease complex (dentilisin) has cytopathic effects consistent with periodontal disease pathogenesis. To date, few direct links have been reported between dentilisin and the cellular and tissue processes that drive periodontal tissue destruction at the transcriptional and/or epigenetic levels. Here, we utilize wild type and dentilisin-deficient T. denticola as well as purified dentilisin to characterize dentilisin-dependent activation of intracellular pathways controlling MMP expression and activity. Our results define a role for dentilisin in initiating this signal cascade. Also, our study identified tissue-specific inducible MMPs that may play novel roles in modulating as-yet uncharacterized host responses in periodontal disease. Lastly, T. denticola dentilisin stimulates tissue-destructive cellular processes in a TLR2/MyD88/Sp1-dependent fashion. Taken together, our study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms underpinning periodontal disease progression which could lead to the development of more efficacious therapeutic treatments.",

Specifically, it is unclear whether APP acts as a receptor, and if so what its ligand(s) may be. We show that APP binds the Wnt ligands Wnt3a and Wnt5a and that this binding regulates APP protein levels. Wnt3a binding promotes full length APP (flAPP) recycling and stability. In contrast, Wnt5a promotes APP targeting to lysosomal compartments and reduces flAPP levels. A conserved Cysteine Rich Domain (CRD) in the extracellular portion of APP is required for Wnt binding, and deletion of the CRD abrogates the effects of Wnts on flAPP levels and trafficking. Finally, loss of APP results in increased axonal and reduced dendritic growth of mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons. This phenotype can be cell-autonomously rescued by full length, but not CRD-deleted, APP.",

    "abstract": "Pesticides use has become a key component of smallholder horticulture production. Therefore, dynamics in pesticides handling need to be ascertained. This study assessed drivers of pesticides use and determinants of changing patterns of pesticides handling practices in smallholder vegetable systems. Data were collected from 385 farmers from Iringa, Arusha, Manyara, and Kilimanjaro regions in Tanzania through an in-depth survey and field observations. A binary probit model was used to derive factors fostering increased pesticides use. Results showed that 47.9 % of all pesticides were wrongly used. Most farmers (88.6%) lacked knowledge of pest control and 88.9% were unaware of safety practices. Disposal methods of empty pesticides foster occupational and environmental exposure (58%). There was an increasing trend in pesticides use (58.4%), accompanied by changing pesticides formulations. Over 60 pesticides with 29 different formulations were used. Mixing pesticides (71.2%), high dose rates with increased frequency of application were observed. Pesticides under Class II WHO hazard (68.9%) dominated. Extremely hazardous (Class Ia) and highly hazardous (Class Ib) were also used. Binary probit model showed that number of crops grown, pesticides mixing, and region contributed positively to the likelihood of increased pesticides use while farmers perception of effectiveness of pesticides, lack of access to safe use information, poor use of safety gears and inability to read pesticides labels had a negative impact. The fate of pesticides use in smallholder vegetable production systems is therefore the culmination of serious health and environmental implications. Excessive pesticides use escalated by increased number of crops, improper use of PPE, and pesticides mixing practices subjects the general population to pesticides environmental exposure thereby jeopardizing sustainability of smallholder vegetable production in Tanzania. Regular training to farmers and extension officers on current and emerging issues on pests and pesticide safe use is vital.",

Listeners performed an auditory syllable pitch-discrimination task and received retro-active cues to selectively attend to a to-be-probed syllable in memory. Accompanied by increased neural activation in fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks, valid retro-cues yielded faster and more perceptually sensitive responses in recalling acoustic detail of memorized syllables. Information about the cued auditory object was decodable from hemodynamic response patterns in superior temporal sulcus (STS), fronto-parietal, and sensorimotor regions. However, among these regions retaining auditory memory objects, neural fidelity in the left STS and its enhancement through attention-to-memory best predicted individuals gain in auditory memory recall precision.

However, recent longitudinal experiments have challenged this view, reporting that most hippocampal cells change their tuning properties over days even in the same environment. Often referred to as representational drift, these dynamics raise multiple questions about the representational capacity and content of the hippocampal code. One such question is whether and how these dynamics impact the contextual code. To address this, here we imaged large CA1 populations over more than a month of daily experience as freely behaving mice participated in an extended geometric morph paradigm. We find that long-timescale changes in population activity occurred orthogonally to the representation of context in network space, allowing for consistent readout of contextual information across weeks. Together, these results demonstrate that long-timescale changes to the CA1 spatial code preserve the relative structure of contextual representation.",

    "abstract": "BO_SCPLOWACKGROUNDC_SCPLOWQuantitative imaging of epithelial tissues prompts for bioimage analysis tools that are widely applicable and accurate. In the case of imaging 3D tissues, a common pre-processing step consists in projecting the acquired 3D volume on a 2D plane mapping the tissue surface. Indeed, while segmenting the tissue cells is amenable on 2D projections, it is still very difficult and cumbersome in 3D. However, for many specimen and models used in Developmental and Cell Biology, the complex content of the image volume surrounding the epithelium in a tissue often reduces the visibility of the biological object in the projection, compromising its subsequent analysis. In addition, the projection may distort the geometry of the tissue and can lead to strong artifacts in the morphology measurement.\n\nRO_SCPLOWESULTSC_SCPLOWHere we introduce a user-friendly toolbox built to robustly project epithelia on their 2D surface from 3D volumes, and to produce accurate morphology measurement corrected for the projection distortion, even for very curved tissues. Our toolbox is built upon two components. LocalZProjector is a user-friendly and configurable Fiji plugin that generates 2D projections and height-maps from potentially large 3D stacks (larger than 40 GB per time-point) by only incorporating signal of the planes with local highest variance/mean intensity, despite a possibly complex image content. DeProj is a MATLAB tool that generates correct morphology measurements by combining the height-map output (such as the one offered by LocalZProjector) and the results of a cell segmentation on the 2D projection, hence effectively deprojecting the 2D segmentation in 3D. In this paper we demonstrate their effectiveness over a wide range of different biological samples. We then compare its performance and accuracy against similar existing tools.\n\nCO_SCPLOWONCLUSIONSC_SCPLOWWe find that LocalZProjector performs well even in situations where the volume to project also contains un-wanted signal in other layers. We show that it can process large images without a pre-processing step. We study the impact of geometrical distortions on morphological measurements induced by the projection. We measured very large distortions which are then corrected by DeProj, providing accurate outputs.",

    "abstract": "Glycosylation is the most common post-translational modification and has myriad biological functions. However, glycan analysis and research has always been a challenge. Here, we would like to present new techniques of glycan fingerprinting based on enzymatic fluorescent labeling and gel electrophoresis. The method is illustrated on SARS-2 spike (S) glycoproteins. SARS-2, a novel coronavirus and the causative agent of COVID-19 pandemic, has devastated the world since the end of 2019. To obtain the N-glycan fingerprint of a S protein, glycans released from the protein are first labeled through enzymatic incorporation of fluorophore-conjugated sialic acid or fucose, and then separated on acrylamide gel through electrophoresis, and finally visualized with a fluorescent imager. To identify the labeled glycans of a fingerprint, glycan standards and glycan ladders that are enzymatically generated are run alongside the samples as references. By comparing the mobility of a labeled glycan to that of a glycan standard, the identity of glycans maybe determined. Due to lack of enzyme for broad O-glycans releasing, O-glycans on the RBD protein are labeled with fluorescent sialic acid and digested with trypsin to obtain labeled glycan peptides that are then separated on gel. Glycan fingerprinting could serve as a quick way for global assessment of the glycosylation of a glycoprotein.",

    "abstract": "It has long been proposed that Leukocyte common Antigen-Related Receptor Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are cell-adhesion proteins for the control of synapse assembly. Their synaptic nanoscale localization, however, has not been established, and the fine structure of synapses after knockout of the three vertebrate genes for LAR-RPTPs (PTP{delta}, PTP{sigma} and LAR) has not been tested. Here, we find that PTP{delta} is precisely apposed to postsynaptic scaffolds at excitatory and inhibitory synapses using superresolution microscopy. We generated triple-conditional knockout mice for PTP{delta}, PTP{sigma} and LAR to test whether they are essential for synapse structure. While mild effects on synaptic vesicle clustering and active zone architecture were detected, synapse numbers and their overall structure were unaffected, membrane anchoring of the active zone persisted, and vesicle docking and release were normal. We conclude that LAR-RPTPs, despite their localization at synaptic appositions, are dispensable for the organization and function of presynaptic nerve terminals.",

    "abstract": "While viral infections are known to hijack the transcription and translation of the host cell, the extent to which encoded viral proteins coordinate these perturbations remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the oncoviral proteins Tax and HBZ interact with specific components of the spliceosome machinery, including the U2 auxiliary factor large subunit (U2AF2), and the complementary factor for APOBEC-1 (A1CF), respectively. Tax and HBZ perturb the splicing landscape in T-cells by altering cassette exons in opposing manners, with Tax inducing exon inclusion while HBZ induces exon exclusion. Among Tax- and HBZ-dependent splicing changes, we identify events that are also altered in Adult T cell leukemia (ATL) patients, and in well-known cancer census genes. Our interactome mapping approach, applicable to other viral oncogenes, has identified spliceosome perturbation as a novel mechanism coordinately used by Tax and HBZ to reprogram the transcriptome.\n\nHighlightsO_LITax and HBZ interact with RNA-binding proteins as well as transcription factors\nC_LIO_LIHTLV-1 encoded proteins Tax and HBZ alter the splicing landscape in T-cells\nC_LIO_LITax and HBZ expression affect alternative splicing of 33 and 63 cancer genes, respectively\nC_LIO_LIOpposing roles for Tax and HBZ in deregulation of gene expression\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=158 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/427104v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b5f6f0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6725b3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1dc32fborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19728c6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "As the number of cardiovascular diseases increases, artificial heart valves and blood vessels have been developed. Although cardiovascular application using decellularized tissue have been studied, the mechanism of their functionality is still unknown. To find the important factor for preparing decellularized cardiovascular prothesis which shows good in vivo performance, the effect of luminal surface structure of decellularized aorta on thrombus formation and cell behavior was investigated. Various luminal surface structures of decellularized aorta were prepared by heating, drying and peeling. The luminal surface structure and collagen denaturation was evaluated by immunohistological staining, collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) staining and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. To evaluate the effect of luminal surface structure of decellularized aorta on thrombus formation and cell behavior, blood clotting test and recellularization of endothelial cells and smooth muscular cells were performed. The results of blood clotting test showed that the closer the luminal surface structure is to native aorta, the higher the anti-coagulant property. From the result of cell seeding-test, it was suggested that vascular cells recognize the luminal surface structure and regulate adhesion, proliferation and functional expression. These results will provide important factor for preparing decellularized cardiovascular prothesis and lead to future development on decellularized cardiovascular applications.",

    "abstract": "Segmental speech units such as phonemes are cued by multiple acoustic dimensions (e.g. F0 and duration), but dimensions do not carry equal perceptual weight. The relative perceptual weights of acoustic speech dimensions are not fixed but vary with context. For example, when speech is altered to create an  accent in which two acoustic dimensions are correlated in a manner opposite that of long-term experience, the dimension that carries less perceptual weight is down-weighted to contribute less in category decisions. It remains unclear, however, whether this short-term reweighting is limited to segmental categorization, or if it extends to categorization of suprasegmental features which span multiple phonemes, syllables, or words, which would suggest that such \"dimension-based statistical learning\" is a widespread phenomenon in speech perception. Here we investigated the relative contribution of two acoustic dimensions to word emphasis. Participants categorized instances of a two-word phrase pronounced with typical covariation of fundamental frequency (F0) and duration, and in the context of an artificial  accent in which F0 and duration (established in prior research on English speech as  primary and  secondary dimensions, respectively) covaried atypically. When categorizing  accented speech, listeners rapidly down-weighted the secondary dimension (duration) while continuing to rely on the primary dimension (F0). This result indicates that listeners continually track short-term regularities across speech input and dynamically adjust the weight of acoustic evidence for suprasegmental categories. Thus, dimension-based statistical learning appears to be a widespread phenomenon in speech perception extending to both segmental and suprasegmental categorization.",

    "abstract": "Intranasal oxytocin is receiving increasing research attention as a potential treatment for several brain disorders due to promising preclinical results. However, translating these findings to humans has been hampered by remaining uncertainties about its pharmacodynamics and the methods used to probe its effects in the human brain. Using a dose-response design (9, 18 and 36 IU) and a novel administration device, we demonstrate that oxytocin-induced physiological changes in the amygdala at rest, a key-hub of the brain oxytocin system, follow a dose-response curve with maximal effects for lower doses. Yet, the effects of oxytocin vary by amygdala subdivision, highlighting the need to qualify dose-response curves within subregion. We further link physiological changes with the density of the oxytocin receptor gene mRNA across brain regions, strengthening our confidence in intranasal oxytocin as a valid approach to engage central targets. Finally, we demonstrate that intranasal oxytocin does not disrupt cerebrovascular reactivity; the absence of major vascular confounds corroborates the validity of haemodynamic neuroimaging to probe the effects of intranasal oxytocin in the human brain.",
