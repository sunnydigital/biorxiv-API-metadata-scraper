    "abstract": "Despite sequence similarity to SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated greater widespread virulence and unique challenges to researchers aiming to study its pathogenicity in humans. The interaction of the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) with its main host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), has emerged as a critical focal point for the development of anti-viral therapeutics and vaccines. Utilizing our recently developed NanoBiT technology-based biosensor, we selectively identify and characterize the impact of mutating certain amino acid residues in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and in ACE2. Specifically, we examine the mutational effects on RBD-ACE2 binding ability, before and after the addition of competitive inhibitors, as well as neutralizing antibody activity. These critical determinants of virus-host interactions may provide more effective targets for ongoing vaccines, drug development, and potentially pave the way for determining the genetic variation underlying disease severity.",

    "abstract": "The conserved, structural HSV-1 tegument protein pUL36 is essential for both virus entry and assembly. While its N-terminal de-ubiquitinase (DUB) activity is dispensable for infection in cell culture, it is required for efficient virus spread in vivo by acting as a potent viral immune evasin. Here, we show that the pUL36 DUB activity was required to overcome interferon-(IFN)-mediated suppression of both plaque initiation and progression to productive infection. Immediately upon virus entry, incoming tegument-derived pUL36-DUB activity helped the virus to escape intrinsic antiviral resistance and efficiently initiate lytic virus replication in IFN-primed cells. Subsequently, de novo expressed pUL36-DUB augmented the efficiency of productive infection and virus yield. Interestingly, removal of IFN shortly after inoculation only resulted in a partial rescue of plaque formation, indicating that an IFN-induced defense mechanism eliminates invading virus particles unless counteracted by pUL36-DUB activity. Taken together, we demonstrated that the pUL36 DUB disarms IFN-induced antiviral responses at two levels, namely, to protect the infectivity of invading virus as well as to augment productive virus replication in IFN-primed cells.\n\nAuthor SummaryHSV-1 is an ubiquitous human pathogen that is responsible for common cold sores but may also cause life-threatening disease. pUL36 is an essential and conserved protein of infectious herpesvirus virions with a unique de-ubiquitinating (DUB) activity. The pUL36 DUB is dispensable for efficient virus infection in cell culture but represents an important viral immune evasin in vivo. Here, we showed that tegument-derived DUB activity delivered by the invading virus particles is required to overcome IFN-induced host resistance and to initiate efficient lytic infection. De novo expressed pUL36 DUB subsequently augments productive infection and virus yield. These data indicate that the pUL36 DUB antagonizes the activity of yet unidentified IFN-inducible E3 ligases to facilitate productive infection at multiple levels. Our findings underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting conserved herpesvirus DUBs to prevent or treat herpesvirus disease.",

    "abstract": "Proteinuria, the spillage of serum proteins into the urine, is a feature of glomerulonephritides, podocyte disorders and diabetic nephropathy. However, the response of tubular epithelial cells to serum protein exposure has not been systematically characterized. Using transcriptomic profiling we studied serum-induced changes in primary human tubular epithelial cells cultured in 3D microphysiological devices. Serum proteins induced cellular proliferation, cytokine secretion and activated a coordinated stress response. We orthogonally confirmed our findings by comparing the transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes of intact human kidney cortex and isolated tubular epithelial cells cultured in fetal bovine serum. Importantly, key transcriptomic programs in response to either type of serum exposure remained consistent, including comparisons to an established mouse model of kidney injury. This serum-induced transcriptional response was dominated by switching off of nuclear receptor-driven programs and activation of AP-1 and NF-{kappa}B signatures in the tubular epigenomic landscape. These features of active regulation were seen at canonical kidney injury genes (HAVCR1) and genes associated with COVID-19 (ACE2, IL6). Our data provide a reference map for dissecting the regulatory and transcriptional response of kidney tubular epithelial cells injury induced by serum.",

    "abstract": "Integrin adhesion complexes regulate cytoskeletal dynamics during cell migration. Adhesion activates phosphorylation of integrin-associated signaling proteins, including Cas (p130Cas, BCAR1), by Src-family kinases. Cas regulates leading-edge protrusion and migration in cooperation with its binding partner, BCAR3. However, it has been unclear how Cas and BCAR3 cooperate. Here, using normal epithelial cells, we find that BCAR3 localization to integrin adhesions requires Cas. In return, Cas phosphorylation, as well as lamellipodia dynamics and cell migration, requires BCAR3. These functions require the BCAR3 SH2 domain and a specific phosphorylation site, Tyr 117, that is also required for BCAR3 downregulation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. These findings place BCAR3 in a co-regulatory positive-feedback circuit with Cas, with BCAR3 requiring Cas for localization and Cas requiring BCAR3 for activation and downstream signaling. The use of a single phosphorylation site in BCAR3 for activation and degradation ensures reliable negative feedback by the ubiquitin-proteasome system.",

    "abstract": "Doxorubicin treatment induces DNA damage and apoptosis in rapidly dividing cell types like intestinal epithelial cells. This has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. In certain cell types some cells do not undergo DNA damage-induced apoptosis in response to doxorubicin but instead become senescent. Induction of senescence in these cells can lead to dysfunction and chronic inflammation, which can lead to more damage. We questioned whether a single dose of doxorubicin would be able to induce apoptosis and senescence in intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. For these studies, we exposed IEC-6 small intestinal epithelial cells to doxorubicin to evaluate whether senescence is induced in a relatively homogeneous population of intestinal epithelial cells. Although some cells underwent apoptosis, those that did not showed traits of senescence. Our studies showed that doxorubicin treatment increased cell size and increased expression of senescence-associated {beta}-galactosidase. Concomitantly, we observed increased mRNA expression of several genes associated with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype including IL-6, Ptges, Faim2, and Cdkn1a and decreased expression of Sirt1. We also observed release of HMGB1, a cellular alarmin, from treated cells. Together, these data suggest that doxorubicin induces senescence in intestinal epithelial cells. Furthermore, our data indicate that cellular responses to a DNA damaging agent, such as doxorubicin, can differ within a population of cells suggesting differing levels of sensitivity within a relatively homogenous cell population. Further studies are needed to delineate the mechanisms that determine whether a cell moves down an apoptotic or senescent pathway following DNA damage.",

    "abstract": "Cell type-specific transcription factors control stem and progenitor cell transitions by establishing networks containing hundreds of genes and proteins. Network complexity renders it challenging to discover essential versus modulatory or redundant components. This scenario is exemplified by GATA2 regulation of hematopoiesis during embryogenesis. Previously, we demonstrated that loss of Gata2, -77 enhancer disrupts the GATA2-dependent genetic network governing erythro-myeloid differentiation. The aberrant network includes the transcription factor Interferon Regulatory Factor-8 and a host of innate immune regulators. Mutant progenitors lose the capacity to balance production of diverse myelo-erythroid progeny. To elucidate mechanisms, we asked if IRF8 is essential, contributory or not required. Irf8 ablation, in the context of the -77 mutant allele, reversed granulocytic deficiencies of -77-/- embryos and rescued an imbalance of dendritic cell progenitors. Despite many dysregulated components that control vital processes, including transcription and signaling, aberrant elevation of a single transcription factor deconstructed the differentiation program.",

We aimed to evaluate the safety of sex hormone (estradiol and progesterone) replacement therapy (HRT) in women who conceived by assisted reproductive technology (ART) with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer.\n\nMethodsWe measured serum E2 and P4 levels at 4-10 weeks of gestation in women who conceived naturally or after timed intercourse or intrauterine insemination for infertility without HRT for luteal support (non-HR group; n=135). We conducted a retrospective comparison of the values from the non-HR group with those of women who conceived by ART with HRT for infertility (HR group; n=75).\n\nResultsSerum E2 levels were significantly higher in the non-HR group than in the HR group at 5, 6, and 8 weeks of gestation. Similarly, serum P4 levels were significantly higher in the non-HR group than in the HR group at 4, 5, and 6 weeks of gestation.\n\nConclusionsThis study suggests that in cancer reproductive medicine for hormone-dependent breast cancer survivors, HRT administered during the first trimester of a pregnancy after primary disease treatment may not increase the sex hormone levels to levels above those seen in spontaneous pregnancy.",

Here we investigated context-dependent flight responses in the Pavlovian serial-compound stimulus (SCS) paradigm. We show here that SCS-evoked flight behavior in male and female rats is dependent on contextual fear. Flight was reduced in the conditioning context after context extinction and could be evoked in a different shock-associated context. Although flight was exclusive to white noise stimuli, it was nonetheless associative insofar as rats that received an equal number of unpaired USs did not show flight-like behavior. Finally, we found that inactivation of either the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) or bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) attenuated both contextual fear and flight responses. This work demonstrates that contextual fear summates with cued and innate fear to drive a high fear state and freeze-to-flight transitions.",

    "abstract": "Translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) utilizes transgenic plants expressing a ribosomal protein fused to a tag for affinity purification of ribosomes and the mRNAs that they are translating. These actively translated mRNAs (translatome) can be interrogated by qPCR or RNAseq. Condition- or cell-specific promoters can be utilized to isolate the translatome of specific cell types, at different growth stages and/or in response to environmental variables. While advantageous for revealing differential expression, this approach may not provide sufficient sensitivity when activity of the condition/cell-specific promoter is weak, when ribosome turnover is low in the cells of interest, or when the targeted cells are ephemeral. In these situations, expressing tagged ribosomes under the control of these specific promoters may not yield sufficient polysomes for downstream analysis. Here, we describe a new TRAP system that employs two transgenes: one is constitutively expressed and encodes a ribosomal protein fused to one fragment of a split GFP; the second is controlled by a stimulus-specific promoter and encodes the second GFP fragment fused to an affinity purification tag. In cells where both transgenes are active, the purification tag is attached to ribosomes by bi-molecular folding and assembly of the split GFP fragments. This approach provides increased sensitivity and better temporal resolution because it labels pre-existing ribosomes and does not depend on rapid ribosome turnover. We describe the optimization and key parameters of this system, and then apply it to a plant-pathogen interaction in which spatial and temporal resolution are difficult to achieve with current technologies.\n\nSignificanceTranslating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) has been modified to allow with increased sensitivity the isolation of RNA from sets of cells in which the activity of condition/cell-specific promoters is weak, ribosome turnover is low, or cells whose nature is ephemeral. Based on the use of a split linker constituted of the GFP driven by a pathogen-inducible promoter, this new TRAP system enabled efficient isolation of translated RNA from pathogen-infected leaf cells.",

Whole genome mRNA sequencing identified genes whose splicing and expression are affected by the reduction of SON, with an enrichment in genes involved in the microtubule cytoskeleton, centrosome and centriolar satellites. SON is required for the proper splicing and expression of CEP131 which encodes a major centriolar satellite protein and is required to organize the trafficking and microtubule network around the centrosomes. This study highlights the importance of the distinct microtubule trafficking network that is intimately associated with nascent centrioles and is responsible for procentriole development.",

    "abstract": "Although actin stress fibers are abundant in cultured cells, little is known about these structures in vivo. In podocytes of the kidney glomerulus, much evidence suggests that mechanobiological mechanisms underlie injury, with changes to actin stress fiber structures potentially responsible for pathological changes to cell morphology. However, this hypothesis is difficult to rigorously test in vivo due to challenges with visualization. We therefore developed the first visualization technique capable of resolving the three-dimensional (3D) podocyte actin network with unprecedented detail in healthy and injured podocytes, and applied this technique to reveal the changes in the actin network that occur upon podocyte injury. Using isolated glomeruli from healthy mice as well as from three different mouse injury models (Cd2ap-/-, Lamb2-/- and the Col4a3-/- model of Alport syndrome), we applied our novel imaging technique that integrates membrane-extraction, focused ion bean scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and deep learning image segmentation. In healthy glomeruli, we observed actin cables that link the interdigitating podocyte foot processes to newly described actin structures located at the periphery of the cell body. The actin cables within the foot processes formed a continuous, mesh-like, electron dense sheet that incorporated the slit diaphragms required for kidney filtration. After injury, the actin network was markedly different, having lost its organization and presenting instead as a disorganized assemblage of actin condensates juxtaposed to the glomerular basement membrane. The new visualization method enabled us, for the first time, to observe the detailed 3D organization of actin networks in both healthy and injured podocytes. Shared features of actin condensations across all three injury models further suggested common mechanobiological pathways that govern changes to podocyte morphology after injury.",

    "abstract": "Importing necessary metabolites into the mitochondrial matrix is a crucial step of fuel choice during stress adaptation. Branched chain-amino acids (BCAA, Valine, Leucine, and Isoleucine) are essential for anabolic processes like protein synthesis, but they are also imported into the mitochondria for catabolic reactions. What controls the distinct subcellular BCAA utilization during stress adaptation is insufficiently understood. The present study reports the role of SLC25A44, a recently identified mitochondrial BCAA carrier (MBC), in the regulation of mitochondrial BCAA catabolism and adaptive response to fever. We found that mitochondrial BCAA oxidation in brown adipose tissue (BAT) is significantly enhanced during fever in response to the pyrogenic mediator prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and psychological stress. Genetic deletion of MBC in a BAT-specific manner blunts mitochondrial BCAA oxidation and non-shivering thermogenesis following intracerebroventricular PGE2 administration. At a cellular level, MBC is required for mitochondrial BCAA deamination as well as the synthesis of mitochondrial amino acids and TCA intermediates. Together, these results illuminate the role of MBC as a determinant of metabolic flexibility to mitochondrial BCAA catabolism and optimal febrile responses. This study also offers an opportunity to control fever by rewiring the subcellular BCAA fate.",

    "abstract": "In emerging epithelial tissues, cells undergo dramatic rearrangements to promote tissue shape changes. Dividing cells remain interconnected via transient cytokinetic bridges. Bridges are cleaved during abscission and currently, the consequences of disrupting abscission in developing epithelia are not well understood. We show that the Rab GTPase, Rab25, localizes near cytokinetic midbodies and likely coordinates abscission through endomembrane trafficking in the epithelium of the zebrafish gastrula during epiboly. In maternal-zygotic Rab25a and Rab25b mutant embryos, morphogenic activity tears open persistent apical cytokinetic bridges that failed to undergo timely abscission. Cytokinesis defects result in anisotropic cell morphologies that are associated with a reduction of contractile actomyosin networks. This slows cell rearrangements and alters the viscoelastic responses of the tissue, all of which likely contribute to delayed epiboly. We present a model in which Rab25 trafficking coordinates cytokinetic bridge abscission and cortical actin density, impacting local cell shape changes and tissue-scale forces.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant pathogens constitute an escalating public health concern. Hence a better understanding of the underlying processes responsible for this expansion is urgently needed. Co-selection of heavy metals/biocides and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has been suggested as one potential mechanism promoting the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This paper aims to elucidate this interplay and exploit differences in antibiotic usage to infer patterns of co-selection by the non-antibiotic factors metals and biocides in the context of pig farming. We examined 278 gut metagenomes from pigs with continuous antibiotic exposure, only at weaning and at no exposure. Metals as growth promoters and biocides as disinfectants are currently used with little restrictions in stock farming. The pigs under continuous antibiotic exposure displayed the highest co-occurrence of ARGs and other genetic elements while the pigs under limited use of antibiotics still showed abundant co-occurrences. Pathogens belonging to Enterobacteriaceae displayed increased co-occurrence phenomena, suggesting that this maintenance is not a random selection process from a mobilized pool but pertains to specific phylogenetic clades. These results suggest that metals and biocides displayed strong selective pressures on ARGs exerted by intensive farming, regardless of the current use of antibiotics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA comprehensive gut microbiome metagenomics analysis of 278 pigs\nC_LIO_LICo-selection phenomena were investigated via co-occurrence patterns as a proxy\nC_LIO_LITwenty-seven types of co-occurrences involving 131 resistance genes were detected\nC_LIO_LIRegardless of use of antibiotics, AMR can be maintained by co-occurrence with MRGs/BRGs\nC_LIO_LIMaintenance of AMR is not a random selection process but pertains to specific phylogenetic clades\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein mediates virus entry and is a major target for neutralizing antibodies. All current vaccines are based on the ancestral Spike with the goal of generating a protective neutralizing antibody response. Several novel SARS-CoV-2 variants with multiple Spike mutations have emerged, and their rapid spread and potential for immune escape have raised concerns. One of these variants, first identified in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7 (also called VUI202012/01), contains eight Spike mutations with potential to impact antibody therapy, vaccine efficacy and risk of reinfection. Here we employed a lentivirus-based pseudovirus assay to show that variant B.1.1.7 remains sensitive to neutralization, albeit at moderately reduced levels (~2-fold), by serum samples from convalescent individuals and recipients of two different vaccines based on ancestral Spike: mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and protein nanoparticle NVX-CoV2373 (Novavax). Some monoclonal antibodies to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of Spike were less effective against the variant while others were largely unaffected. These findings indicate that B.1.1.7 is not a neutralization escape variant that would be a major concern for current vaccines, or for an increased risk of reinfection.",

    "abstract": "Interactions between plants and leaf herbivores have long been implicated as the major driver of plant secondary metabolite diversity. However, other plant-animal interactions, such as those between fruits and frugivores, may also be involved in phytochemical diversification. Using 12 species of Piper, we conducted untargeted metabolomics and molecular networking with extracts of fruits and leaves. We evaluated organ-specific secondary metabolite composition and compared multiple dimensions of phytochemical diversity across organs, including richness, structural complexity, and variability across samples at multiple scales within and across species. Plant organ identity significantly influenced secondary metabolite composition, both independent of and in interaction with species identity. Leaves and fruit shared a majority of compounds, but fruits contained more unique compounds and had higher total estimated chemical richness. While organ-level chemical richness and structural complexity varied substantially across species, fruit diversity exceeded leaf diversity in more species than the reverse. Furthermore, the variance in chemical composition across samples was higher for fruits than leaves. By documenting a broad pattern of high phytochemical diversity in fruits relative to leaves, this study lays groundwork for incorporating fruit into a comprehensive and integrative understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors shaping secondary metabolite composition at the whole-plant level.",

    "abstract": "Morphological analyses are key outcome assessments for nerve regeneration studies but are historically limited to tissue sections. Novel optical tissue clearing techniques enabling three-dimensional imaging of entire organs at a subcellular resolution have revolutionized morphological studies of the brain. To extend their applicability to experimental nerve repair studies we adapted these techniques to nerves and their motor and sensory targets in rats. The solvent-based protocols rendered harvested peripheral nerves and their target organs transparent within 24 h while preserving tissue architecture and fluorescence. Optical clearing is compatible with conventional laboratory techniques, including retrograde labelling studies, and computational image segmentation, providing fast and precise cell quantitation. Further, optically cleared organs enable three-dimensional morphometry at an unprecedented scale including dermatome-wide innervation studies, tracing of intramuscular nerve branches and mapping of neurovascular networks. Given their wide-ranging applicability, rapid processing times and low costs, tissue clearing techniques are likely to be a key technology for next-generation nerve repair studies.",

    "abstract": "An essential role of the hippocampal region is to integrate information to compute and update representations. How this transpires is highly debated. Many theories hinge on the integration of self-motion signals and the existence of continuous attractor networks (CAN). CAN models hypothesise that neurons coding for navigational correlates - such as position and direction - receive inputs from cells conjunctively coding for position, direction and self-motion. As yet, such conjunctive coding had not been found in the hippocampal region. Here, we report neurons coding for angular and linear velocity, distributed across the medial entorhinal cortex, the presubiculum and the parasubiculum. These self-motion neurons often conjunctively encoded position and/or direction, yet lacked a structured organisation, calling for the revision of current CAN models. These results offer insights as to how linear/angular speed - derivative in time of position/direction - may allow the updating of spatial representations, possibly uncovering a generalised algorithm to update any representation.",

    "abstract": "Flight in birds evolved through patterning of the wings from forelimbs and transition from alternating gait to synchronous flapping. In mammals, the spinal midline guidance molecule ephrin-B3 instructs the wiring that enables limb alternation, and its deletion leads to synchronous hopping gait. Here we show that the ephrin-B3 protein in birds lacks several motifs present in other vertebrates, diminishing its affinity for the EphA4 receptor. The avian ephrin-B3 gene lacks an enhancer that drives midline expression, and is missing in Galliformes. The morphology and wiring at brachial levels of the chick spinal cord resemble those of ephrin-B3 null mice. Importantly, dorsal midline decussation, evident in the mutant mouse, is apparent at the chick brachial level, and is prevented by expression of exogenous ephrin-B3 at the roof plate. Our findings support a role for loss of ephrin-B3 function in shaping the avian brachial spinal cord circuitry and facilitating synchronous wing flapping.\n\nTeaserWalking vs flying: Deciphering the organization and evolution of the neuronal network that controls wing flapping in birds.",

Directed functional connectivity measures, such as the Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (GPDC), provide estimates of the causal influence between areas. However, the relation between causality estimates and structural connectivity is still not clear. We analyzed this problem by evaluating the effectiveness of GPDC to estimate the connectivity of a ground-truth, data-constrained computational model of a large-scale network model of the mouse cortex. The model contains 19 cortical areas comprised of spiking neurons, with areas connected by long-range projections with weights obtained from a tract-tracing cortical connectome. We show that GPDC values provide a reasonable estimate of structural connectivity, with an average Pearson correlation over simulations of 0.74. Moreover, even in a typical electrophysiological recording scenario containing five areas, the mean correlation was above 0.6. These results suggest that it may be possible to empirically estimate structural connectivity from functional connectivity even when detailed whole-brain recordings are not achievable.",

In the context of searching for COVID-19 related scientific literature, we present an information retrieval methodology for effectively finding relevant publications for different information needs. Our multi-stage information retrieval architecture combines probabilistic weighting models and re-ranking algorithms based on neural masked language models. The methodology was evaluated in the context of the TREC-COVID challenge, achieving competitive results with the top ranking teams participating in the competition. Particularly, the ranking combination of bag-of-words and language models significantly outperformed a BM25-based baseline model (16 percentage points for the NDCG@20 metric), correctly retrieving more than 16 out of the top 20 documents retrieved.

    "abstract": "Self-assembly is often studied in a three-dimensional (3D) solution, but a significant fraction of binding events involve proteins that can reversibly bind and diffuse along a two-dimensional (2D) surface. In a recent study, we quantified how proteins can exploit the reduced dimension of the membrane to trigger complex formation. Here, we derive a single expression for the characteristic timescale of this multi-step assembly process, where the change in dimensionality renders rates and concentrations effectively time-dependent. We find that proteins can accelerate complex formation due to an increase in relative concentration, driving more frequent collisions which often wins out over slow-downs due to diffusion. Our model contains two protein populations that associate with one another and use a distinct site to bind membrane lipids, creating a complex reaction network. However, by identifying two major rate-limiting pathways to reach an equilibrium steady-state, we derive an accurate approximation for the mean first passage time when lipids are in abundant supply. Our theory highlights how the  sticking rate, or effective adsorption coefficient of the membrane is central in controlling timescales. We also derive a corrected localization rate to quantify how the geometry of the system and diffusion can reduce rates of localization. We validate and test our results using kinetic and reaction-diffusion simulations. Our results establish how the speed of key assembly steps can shift by orders-of-magnitude when membrane localization is possible, which is critical to understanding mechanisms used in cells.",

    "abstract": "Salmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (SE) is a zoonotic pathogen which causes foodborne diseases in humans through contaminated poultry products, as well as severe disease symptoms in young chickens. More insight in innate and adaptive immune responses of chickens to SE infection is needed to understand elimination of SE. Seven-day-old broiler chickens were experimentally challenged with SE and numbers and responsiveness of innate immune cells including natural killer (NK) cells, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) were assessed during 21 days post-infection (dpi). In parallel, numbers and function of {gamma}{delta} T cells, CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as well as antibody titres were determined. SE was observed in the intestine and spleen of SE-infected chickens at 7 dpi. NK and T cells responded first to SE at 1 and 3 dpi as indicated by increased numbers of intestinal IL-2R+ and 20E5+ NK cells, in addition to enhanced activation of intestinal and splenic NK cells. At 7 dpi in the spleen, the presence of macrophages and the expression of activation markers on DCs was increased. At 21 dpi, an increase in intestinal {gamma}{delta} and CD8+ T cell numbers was observed. Furthermore, SE-specific proliferation of splenic CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was observed and SE-specific antibodies were detected in all blood samples of SE-infected chickens. In conclusion, SE results in enhanced numbers and activation of innate cells during early stages of infection and it is hypothesized that in concert with subsequent specific T cell and antibody responses, reduction of SE in infected chickens is achieved. A better understanding of innate and adaptive immune responses important in the elimination of SE will aid in developing immune-modulation strategies, which may increase resistance and prevent SE infection and colonization in young broiler chickens and hence increase food safety for humans.\n\nAuthor summarySalmonella enterica serotype Enteritidis (SE) causes foodborne zoonotic diseases in humans, as well as a severe disease in young chickens. As a consequence of which health and welfare of humans and chickens are affected, resulting in substantial economic losses. To enable development of immune-mediated prevention strategies in chickens, more insight in the immune responses to SE is needed to understand how the infection is eliminated. For this purpose, we investigated non-specific and specific immune responses upon experimental SE infection in young broiler chickens. In this study, we found SE in the intestine and spleen of SE-infected chickens at 7 days post-infection (dpi). We show that natural killer (NK) cells respond first by enhanced presence and activation, followed by increased presence of macrophages and activation of dendritic cells. These early responses are hypothesized to stimulate the observed subsequent specific T cell and antibody responses. Better understanding of immune responses important in the elimination of SE will aid in developing immune-modulation strategies, which may increase resistance and prevent SE infection and colonization in young chickens and hence reduce SE-related foodborne illness in humans.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundLong ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are known to influence numerous biological processes including cellular differentiation and tissue development. They are also implicated in the maintenance, health and physiological function of many tissues including the heart. Indeed, manipulating the expression of specific lncRNAs has been shown to improve pathological cardiac phenotypes such as heart failure. One lncRNA studied in various settings is OIP5-AS1 (also known as 1700020I14Rik and Cyrano), however its role in cardiac pathologies remains mostly uncharacterised.\n\nMethodsWe used data generated from FACS sorted murine cardiomyocytes, human iPSC derived cardiomyocytes, as well as heart tissue from various animal models to investigate OIP5-AS1 expression in health and disease. Using CRISPR we engineered a global OIP5-AS1 knock out (KO) mouse model and performed cardiac pressure overload experiments to study heart failure in these animals. RNA-sequencing of left ventricles provided mechanistic insight between WT and KO mice.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that OIP5-AS1 expression is regulated during cardiac development and cardiac specific pathologies in both rodent and human models. Moreover, we demonstrate that global female OIP5-AS1 KO mice develop exacerbated heart failure, but male mice do not. Transcriptomics and gene set enrichment analysis suggests that OIP5-AS1 may regulate pathways that impact mitochondrial function.\n\nConclusionsOIP5-AS1 is regulated in cardiac tissue and its deletion leads to worsening heart function under pressure overload in female mice. This may be due to impairments in mitochondrial function, highlighting OIP5-AS1 as a gene of interest in sex-specific differences in heart failure.",
