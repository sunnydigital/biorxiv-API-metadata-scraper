    "abstract": "In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was identified as the cause of pneumonia with severe respiratory distress and outbreaks in Wuhan, China. The rapid and global spread of SARS-CoV-2 resulted in the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Earlier during the pandemic, there were limited genetic viral variations. As millions of people became infected, multiple single amino acid substitutions emerged. Many of these substitutions have no consequences. However, some of the new variants show a greater infection rate, more severe disease, and reduced sensitivity to current prophylaxes and treatments. Of particular importance in SARS-CoV-2 transmission are mutations that occur in the Spike (S) protein, the protein on the viral outer envelope that binds to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor (hACE2). Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of 441,168 individual virus sequences isolated from humans throughout the world. From the individual sequences, we identified 3,540 unique amino acid substitutions in the S protein. Analysis of these different variants in the S protein pinpointed important functional and structural sites in the protein. This information may guide the development of effective vaccines and therapeutics to help arrest the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "Endosomal signaling downstream of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has emerged as a novel paradigm with important pharmacological and physiological implications. Yet, our knowledge of the functional consequences of intracellular signaling is incomplete. To begin to address this gap, we combined an optogenetic approach for site-specific generation of the prototypical second messenger generated by active GPCRs, cyclic AMP (cAMP), with unbiased mass spectrometry-based analysis of phosphoproteomic effects. We identified 218 unique, highconfidence sites whose phosphorylation is either increased or decreased in response to cAMP production. We next determined that the same amount of cAMP produced from endosomes led to more robust changes in phosphorylation than the plasma membrane. Remarkably, this was true for the entire repertoire of identified targets, and irrespective of their annotated sub-cellular localization. Furthermore, we identified a particularly strong endosome bias for a subset of proteins that are dephosphorylated in response to cAMP. Through bioinformatics analysis, we established these targets as putative substrates for protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and we propose compartmentalized activation of PP2A-B56{delta} as the likely underlying mechanism. Altogether, our study extends the concept that endosomal signaling is a significant functional contributor to cellular responsiveness by establishing a unique role for localized cAMP production in defining categorically distinct phosphoresponses.",

    "abstract": "The antiviral restriction factor, tetherin, blocks the release of several different families of enveloped viruses, including the Coronaviridae. Tetherin is an interferon-induced protein that forms parallel homodimers between the host cell and viral particles, linking viruses to the surface of infected cells and inhibiting their release. We demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes tetherin downregulation, and that tetherin depletion from cells enhances SARS-CoV-2 viral titres. We investigated the potential viral proteins involved in abrogating tetherin function and found that SARS- CoV-2 ORF3a reduces tetherin localisation within biosynthetic organelles via reduced retrograde recycling and increases tetherin localisation to late endocytic organelles. By removing tetherin from the Coronavirus budding compartments, ORF3a enhances virus release. We also found expression of Spike protein caused a reduction in cellular tetherin levels. Our results confirm that tetherin acts as a host restriction factor for SARS-CoV-2 and highlight the multiple distinct mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 subverts tetherin function.\n\nAuthor SummarySince it was identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has displayed voracious transmissibility which has resulted in rapid spread of the virus and a global pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the Coronaviridae family whose members are encapsulated by a host-derived protective membrane shell. Whilst the viral envelope may provide protection for the virus, it also provides an opportunity for the host cell to restrict the virus and stop it spreading. The anti-viral restriction factor, tetherin, acts to crosslink viruses to the surface of infected cells and prevent their spread to uninfected cells. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes viral restriction by tetherin, and that SARS-CoV-2 moves tetherin away from the site of Coronavirus budding to enhance its ability to escape and infect naive cells. Tetherin depletion from cells enhanced SARS-CoV-2 viral release and increased propagation of the virus. We found that the SARS-CoV-2 protein, ORF3a, redirects tetherin away from the biosynthetic organelles where tetherin would become incorporated to newly forming SARS-CoV-2 virions - and instead relocalises tetherin to late endocytic organelles. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 Spike downregulates tetherin. These two mechanisms, in addition to the well described antagonism of interferon and subsequent ISGs highlight the multiple mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 abrogates tetherin function. Our study provides new insights into how SARS-CoV-2 subverts human antiviral responses and escapes from infected cells.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative agent of the global COVID-19 pandemic and the lack of therapeutics hinders pandemic control1-2. Although lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients1-3, how SARS-CoV-2 induces tissue pathology in the lung remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate tens of thousands of self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically matched human lung buds derived from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) cultured on micropatterned substrates. Strikingly, in vitro-derived human lung buds resemble fetal human lung tissue and display in vivo-like proximo-distal coordination of alveolar and airway tissue differentiation whose 3D epithelial self-organization is directed by the levels of KGF. Single-cell transcriptomics unveiled the cellular identities of airway and alveolar tissue and the differentiation of WNThi cycling alveolar stem cells, a human-specific lung cell type4. These synthetic human lung buds are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-dependent susceptibilities to infection, intercellular transmission and cytopathology in airway and alveolar tissue in individual lung buds. Interestingly, we detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies isolated from convalescent plasma that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and intercellular transmission. Our platform offers unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant lung tissue that recapitulate key hallmarks of human lung development and can be used to track SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify candidate therapeutics for COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGene expression is potentially an important heritable quantitative trait that mediates between genetic variation and higher-level complex phenotypes through time and condition-dependent regulatory interactions. Increasing quantities of high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing and standardization of research populations has resulted in the accumulation of overlapping -omics data allowing for deeper investigation into the genomic structure and conditional stability of gene expression traits. Therefore, we sought to explore both the genomic and condition-specific characteristics of gene expression heritability within the context of chromosomal structure, using a diverse, 84-line, Oryza sativa (rice) population under optimal and salt-stressed conditions.\n\nResultsHeritability was estimated for the 84 genotypes with common tools and an approach using biological gene expression replicates similar to a twin study in humans. Overall, 5,936 genes were found to have heritable expression regardless of condition and 1,377 genes were found to have heritable expression only during salt stress. These genes with salt-specific heritable expression are enriched for functional terms associated with response to stimulus and transcription factor activity. Additionally, we discovered that highly and lowly expressed genes, and genes with heritable expression are distributed differently along the chromosomes in patterns that follow previously identified chromosomal conformation capture (Hi-C) A/B chromatin compartments. Furthermore, multiple genomic hot-spots enriched for genes with salt-specific heritability were identified on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, and 8. These hotspots were found to contain genes functionally enriched for transcriptional regulation and overlaps with a previously identified major QTL for salt-tolerance in rice.\n\nConclusionsInvestigating the heritability of traits, and in-particular gene expression traits, is important towards a basic understanding of how regulatory networks behave across a population. Additionally, heritable gene expression architecture can be used for further exploration of gene-trait relationships, assist in interpretation and analysis of eQTLs, used as priors for approaches seeking to identification of potential biomarkers, or used in genomic selection modules with potential applications in plant breeding. This work provides insights into patterns of expression and spatial patterns at the chromosomal level.",

    "abstract": "A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused over 190 million cases and over 4 million deaths worldwide since it occurred in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Here we conceptualized the temporospatial evolutionary and expansion dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 by taking a series of cross-sectional view of viral genomes from early outbreak in January 2020 in Wuhan to early phase of global ignition in early April, and finally to the subsequent global expansion by late December 2020. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of the early patients in Wuhan, Wuhan/WH04/2020 is supposed to be a more appropriate reference genome of SARS-CoV-2, instead of the first sequenced genome Wuhan-Hu-1. By scrutinizing the cases from the very early outbreak, we found a viral genotype from the Seafood Market in Wuhan featured with two concurrent mutations (i.e. M type) had become the overwhelmingly dominant genotype (95.3%) of the pandemic one year later. By analyzing 4,013 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from different continents by early April, we were able to interrogate the viral genomic composition dynamics of initial phase of global ignition over a timespan of 14-week. 11 major viral genotypes with unique geographic distributions were also identified. WE1 type, a descendant of M and predominantly witnessed in western Europe, consisted a half of all the cases (50.2%) at the time. The mutations of major genotypes at the same hierarchical level were mutually exclusive, which implying that various genotypes bearing the specific mutations were propagated during human-to-human transmission, not by accumulating hot-spot mutations during the replication of individual viral genomes. As the pandemic was unfolding, we also used the same approach to analyze 261,323 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from the world since the outbreak in Wuhan (i.e. including all the publicly available viral genomes) in order to recapitulate our findings over one-year timespan. By 25 December 2020, 95.3% of global cases were M type and 93.0% of M-type cases were WE1. In fact, at present all the four variants of concern (VOC) are the descendants of WE1 type. This study demonstrates the viral genotypes can be utilized as molecular barcodes in combination with epidemiologic data to monitor the spreading routes of the pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control measures. Moreover, the dynamics of viral mutational spectrum in the study may help the early identification of new strains in patients to reduce further spread of infection, guide the development of molecular diagnosis and vaccines against COVID-19, and help assess their accuracy and efficacy in real world at real time.",

    "abstract": "Restriction enzymes that combine DNA methylation and cleavage activities into a single polypeptide or protein assemblage and that modify just one DNA strand for host protection are capable of more efficient adaptation towards novel target sites. However, they must solve the problem of discrimination between newly replicated and unmodified host sites (needing methylation) and invasive foreign site (needing to lead to cleavage). One solution to this problem might be that the activity that occurs at any given site is dictated by the oligomeric state of the bound enzyme. Methylation requires just a single bound site and is relatively slow, while cleavage requires that multiple unmethylated target sites (often found in incoming, foreign DNA) be brought together into an enzyme-DNA complex to license rapid cleavage. To validate and visualize the basis for such a mechanism, we have determined the catalytic behavior of a bifunctional Type IIL restriction-modification ( RM) enzyme (DrdV) and determined its high-resolution structure at several different stages of assembly and coordination with multiple bound DNA targets using CryoEM. The structures demonstrate a mechanism of cleavage by which an initial dimer is formed between two DNA-bound enzyme molecules, positioning the single endonuclease domain from each enzyme against the others DNA and requiring further oligomerization through differing protein-protein contacts of additional DNA-bound enzyme molecules to enable cleavage. The analysis explains how endonuclease activity is licensed by the presence of multiple target-containing DNA duplexes and provides a clear view of the assembly through 3D space of a DNA-bound RM enzyme  synapse that leads to rapid cleavage of foreign DNA.",

In this study, our objective was to understand the effect of specific ECM ligand-integrin interaction on hiPSC- VSMCs paracrine secretion, cell proliferation, and morphology. We here showed a precise modulation of hiPSC-VSMC in a fibronectin functionalized fibrillar collagen scaffold by targeting their integrin {beta}3. The secretion of proangiogenic growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was found to be fibronectin dependent via v{beta}3 integrin interactions. Also, our data indicate the possible role of a positive feedback loop between integrin {beta}3, bFGF, and matrix metalloproteinase-2 in regulating hiPSC- VSMCs morphology and cell proliferation.

    "abstract": "Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent inactivation (CDI) of CaV channels is a critical regulatory process required for tuning the kinetics of Ca2+ entry for different cell types and physiologic responses. Calmodulin (CaM) resides on the IQ domain of the CaV carboxy-tail, such that Ca2+ binding initiates a reduction in channel open probability, manifesting as CDI. This regulatory process exerts a significant impact on Ca2+ entry and is tailored by alternative splicing. CaV1.3 and CaV1.4 feature a long-carboxy-tail splice variant that modulates CDI through a competitive mechanism. In these channels, the distal-carboxy-tail (DCT) harbors an inhibitor of CDI (ICDI) module that competitively displaces CaM from the IQ domain, thereby diminishing CDI. While this overall mechanism is now well-described, the detailed interaction loci for ICDI binding to the IQ domain is yet to be elucidated. Here, we perform alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the IQ and ICDI domains and evaluate the contribution of neighboring regions. We identify multiple critical residues within the IQ domain, ICDI and the nearby A region of the channel, which are required for high affinity IQ/ICDI binding. Importantly, disruption of this interaction commensurately diminishes ICDI function, as seen by the re-emergence of CDI in mutant channels. Furthermore, analysis of the homologous ICDI region of CaV1.2 reveals a selective effect of this channel region on CaV1.3 channels, implicating a cross-channel modulatory scheme in cells expressing both channel subtypes. In all, these findings provide new insights into a molecular rheostat that fine tunes Ca2+ entry and supports normal neuronal and cardiac function.",

Here we show that CTPS2 exhibits a distinct expression pattern throughout embryo development and loss of function mutants were embryo lethal, as siliques from +/ctps2 plants contained nearly 25 % aborted seeds. This phenotype was rescued by complementation with CTPS2 under control of its endogenous promoter. Reporter lines revealed CTPS2 expression only in the tip of columella cells in embryos of the heart and later stages. Furthermore CTPS2 expression in roots, most pronounced in the columella cells, shoots and vasculature tissue of young seedlings was observed. Filial generations of +/ctps2 plants did not germinate properly, even under external cytidine supply. During embryo development CTPS2 expression was similar to the well known auxin reporter DR5. Indeed, the cloned promoter region we used in this study possesses a repeat of an auxin response element. Thus, we conclude that CTPS2 is essential for CTP supply in the developing embryo and a knockout of CTPS2 is embryo lethal.",

    "abstract": "Targeted gene silencing using small regulatory RNAs is a widely used technique for genetic studies in plants. Artificial microRNAs are one common approach; they have the advantage of producing just a single functional small RNA which can be designed for high target specificity and low off-target effects. Simultaneous silencing of multiple targets with artificial microRNAs can be achieved by producing polycistronic microRNA precursors. Alternatively, specialized trans-acting short interfering RNA (tasiRNA) precursors can be designed to produce several specific tasiRNAs at once. Here we tested several artificial microRNA- and tasiRNA-based methods for multiplexed gene silencing in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Nicotiana benthamiana. Small RNA sequencing analyses revealed that many previously described approaches resulted in poor small RNA processing. The 5-most microRNA precursor hairpins on polycistronic artificial microRNA precursors were generally processed more accurately than precursors at the 3 end. Polycistronic artificial microRNAs where the hairpin precursors were separated by transfer RNAs had the best processing precision. Strikingly, artificial tasiRNA precursors failed to be processed in the expected phased manner in our system. These results highlight the need for further development of multiplexed artificial microRNA and tasiRNA strategies. The importance of small RNA sequencing, as opposed to single-target assays such as RNA blots or real-time PCR, is also discussed.\n\nSignificance statementSeveral strategies for multiplexed gene silencing using artificial microRNAs or tasiRNAs have been described. We find that many result in imprecise processing, and thus low accumulation of the intended small RNAs. Our findings highlight the importance of small RNA sequencing to fully analyze gene silencing experiments, and also the need for continued methodological development of these methods.",

    "abstract": "Bacteria equipped with genetically-encoded lactate biosensors would support several applications in biopharmaceutical production, diagnosis, or therapeutics. However, many applications involve glucose-rich and anaerobic environments, in which current whole-cell lactate biosensors have low performance. Here we engineered a synthetic lactate biosensor system by repurposing the natural LldPRD promoter regulated by the LldR transcriptional regulator. We removed glucose catabolite repression by designing a hybrid promoter, containing LldR operators and tuned both regulator and reporter gene expression to optimize biosensor signal-to-noise ratio. The resulting lactate biosensor, termed ALPaGA (A Lactate Promoter Operating in Glucose and Anaerobia) can operate in glucose rich, aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Our work provides a versatile lactate biosensing platform suitable for many environmental conditions.",

    "abstract": "In the recent years, engineering new-to-nature CO2 and C1 fixing metabolic pathways made a leap forward. These new, artificial pathways promise higher yields and activity than natural ones like the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle. The question remains how to best predict their in vivo performance and what actually makes one pathway \"better\" than another.\n\nIn this context, we explore aerobic carbon fixation pathways by a computational approach and compare them based on their ATP-efficiency and specific activity considering the kinetics and thermodynamics of the reactions. Beside natural pathways, this included the artificial Reductive Glycine Pathway, the CETCH cycle and two completely new cycles with superior stoichiometry: The Reductive Citramalyl-CoA cycle and the 2-Hydroxyglutarate-Reverse Tricarboxylic Acid cycle. A comprehensive kinetic data set was collected for all enzymes of all pathways and missing kinetic data was sampled with the Parameter Balancing algorithm. Kinetic and thermodynamic data were fed to the Enzyme Cost Minimization algorithm to check for respective inconsistencies and calculate pathway specific activities.\n\nWe found that the Reductive Glycine Pathway, the CETCH cycle and the new Reductive Citramalyl-CoA cycle were predicted to have higher ATP-efficiencies and specific activities than the natural cycles. The Calvin Cycle performed better than previously thought, however. It can be concluded that the weaker overall characteristics in the design of the Calvin Cycle might be compensated by other benefits like robustness, low nutrient demand and a good compatibility with the hosts physiological requirements. Nevertheless, the artificial carbon fixation cycles hold great potential for future applications in Industrial Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology.",

    "abstract": "Cells employ intracellular signaling pathways to sense and respond to changes in their external environment. In recent years, live-cell biosensors have revealed complex pulsatile dynamics in many pathways, but studies of these signaling dynamics are limited by the necessity of live-cell imaging at high spatiotemporal resolution1. Here, we describe an approach to infer pulsatile signaling dynamics from just a single measurement in fixed cells using a pulse-detecting gene circuit. We computationally screened for circuit with pulse detecting capability, revealing an incoherent feedforward topology that robustly performs this computation. We then implemented the motif experimentally for the Erk signaling pathway using a single engineered transcription factor and fluorescent protein reporter. Our  recorder of Erk activity dynamics (READer) responds sensitively to both spontaneous and stimulus-driven Erk pulses. READer circuits thus open the door to permanently labeling transient, dynamic cell populations to elucidate the mechanistic underpinnings and biological consequences of signaling dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The D301N NLRP3 mutation in mice (D303N in humans) causes severe multi-organ damage and early death driven by the constitutively activated NLRP3 (NLRP3ca) inflammasome. Triggered inflammasomes activate caspase-1 to process IL-1 family cytokines and gasdermin D (GSDMD), generating N-terminal fragments, which oligomerize within the plasma membrane to form pores, which cause inflammatory cell death (pyroptosis) and through which IL-1{beta} and IL-18 are secreted. GSDMD activation is central to disease symptoms since spontaneous inflammation in Nlrp3ca;Gsdmd-/- mice is negligible. Unexpectedly, when Nlrp3ca;Gsdmd-/- mice were challenged with LPS or TNF-, they secreted high amounts of IL-1{beta} and IL-18, suggesting an alternative GSDMD-independent inflammatory pathway. Here we show that GSDMD deficient macrophages subjected to inflammatory stimuli activate caspase-8, -3 and GSDME-dependent cytokine release and pyroptosis. Caspase-8, -3 and GSDME also activated pyroptosis when NLRP3 was stimulated in caspase-1 deficient macrophages. Thus, a salvage caspase-8, -3-GSDME inflammatory pathway is activated following NLRP3 activation when the canonical NLRP3-caspase-1-GSDMD is blocked. Surprisingly, the active metabolite of the GSDMD-inhibitor disulfiram, inhibited not only GSDMD but also GSDME-mediated inflammation in vitro and suppressed severe inflammatory disease symptoms in Nlrp3ca mice, a model for severe neonatal multisystem inflammatory disease. Although disulfiram did not directly inhibit GSDME, it suppressed inflammasome activation in GSDMD-deficient cells. Thus, the combination of inflammatory signals and NLRP3ca overwhelmed the protection provided by GSDMD deficiency, rewiring signaling cascades through caspase-8, -3 and GSDME to propagate inflammation. This functional redundancy suggests that concomitant inhibition of GSDMD and GSDME may be necessary to suppress disease in inflammasomopathy patients.",

    "abstract": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an essential microorganism in food biotechnology; particularly, in wine and beer making. During wine fermentation, yeasts transform sugars present in the grape juice into ethanol and carbon dioxide. The process occurs in batch conditions and is, for the most part, an anaerobic process. Previous studies linked limited-nitrogen conditions with problematic fermentations, with negative consequences for the performance of the process and the quality of the final product. It is, therefore, of the highest interest to anticipate such problems through mathematical models. Here we propose a model to explain problematic fermentations under nitrogen-limited anaerobic conditions. We separated the biomass formation into two phases: growth and carbohydrate accumulation. Growth was modelled using the well-known Monod law while carbohydrate accumulation was modelled by an empirical function, analogous to a proportional controller activated by the limitation of available nitrogen. We also proposed to formulate the fermentation rate as a function of the total protein content when relevant data are available. The final model was used to successfully explain a series of experiments taken from the literature, performed under normal and nitrogen-limited conditions. Our results revealed that Monod law is insufficient to explain biomass formation kinetics in nitrogen-limited fermentations of S. cerevisiae. The goodness-of-fit of the herewith proposed model is superior to that of previously published models, offering the means to predict, and thus control, problematic fermentations.\n\nIMPORTANCEProblematic fermentations still occur in the winemaking industrial practise. Problems include sluggish rates of fermentation, which have been linked to insufficient levels of assimilable nitrogen. Data and relevant models can help anticipate poor fermentation performance. In this work, we proposed a model to predict biomass growth and fermentation rate under nitrogen-limited conditions and tested its performance with previously published experimental data. Our results show that the well-known Monod law does not suffice to explain biomass formation. A second term accounting for carbohydrate accumulation is required to predict successfully, and thus control, problematic fermentations.",

The order and the effect of these events are undetermined. In this study, we modeled the gene expression, DNA-binding of transcriptional regulators, and histone modifications during adipocyte differentiation and evaluated the effect of the regulators on gene expression in terms of direction and magnitude. Then, we identified the overlap of the transcription factors and co-factors binding sites and targets. Finally, we built a chromatin states model based on the histone marks and studied their relation with the factors binding. Adipogenic factors differentially regulated autophagy genes as part of the differentiation program. Co-regulators associated with specific transcription factors and preceded them to the regulatory regions. Transcription factors differed in the binding time and location, and their effect on expression was either localized or long-lasting. Adipogenic factors disproportionately targeted genes coding for autophagy-specific transcription factors. To sum, a hierarchical arrangement between adipogenic transcription factors and co-factors drives the regulation of autophagy during adipocyte differentiation.",

    "abstract": "The implementation of prospective drug resistance (DR) studies in the R&D pipelines is a common practice for many infectious diseases, but not for Neglected Tropical Diseases. Here, we explored and demonstrated the importance of this approach, using as paradigms Leishmania donovani, the etiological agent of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), and TCMDC-143345, a promising compound of the GSK  Leishbox to treat VL. We experimentally selected resistance to TCMDC-143345 in vitro and characterized resistant parasites at genomic and phenotypic levels. We found that it took more time to develop resistance to TCMDC-143345 than to other drugs in clinical use and that there was no cross resistance to these drugs, suggesting a new and unique mechanism. By whole genome sequencing, we found two mutations in the gene encoding the L. donovani dynamin-1-like protein (LdoDLP1) that were fixed at highest drug pressure. Through phylogenetic analysis, we identified LdoDLP1 as a family member of the dynamin-related proteins, a group of proteins that impacts the shapes of biological membranes by mediating fusion and fission events, with a putative role in mitochondrial fission. We found that L. donovani lines genetically engineered to harbor the two identified LdoDLP1 mutations were resistant to TCMDC-143345 and displayed altered mitochondrial properties. By homology modeling, we showed how the two LdoDLP1 mutations may influence protein structure and function. Taken together, our data reveal a clear involvement of LdoDLP1 in the adaptation/resistance of L. donovani to TCMDC-143345.\n\nImportanceHumans and their pathogens are continuously locked in a molecular arms race during which the eventual emergence of pathogen drug resistance (DR) seems inevitable. For neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), DR is generally studied retrospectively, once it has already been established in clinical settings. We previously recommended to keep one step ahead in the host-pathogen arms race and implement prospective DR studies in the R&D pipeline, a common practice for many infectious diseases, but not for NTDs. Here, using Leishmania donovani, the etiological agent of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL), and TCMDC-143345, a promising compound of the GSK  Leishbox to treat VL, as paradigms, we experimentally selected resistance to the compound and proceeded to genomic and phenotypic characterization of DR parasites. The results gathered in the present study suggest a new DR mechanism involving the L. donovani dynamin-1 like protein (LdoDLP1) and demonstrate the practical relevance of prospective DR studies.",

This is even the case in wild host populations that provide ecosystem services, where small fitness effects may have major ecological and financial impacts in aggregate. One such group of hosts are the bumblebees, which have a major role in the pollination of food crops and have suffered population declines and range contractions in recent decades. In this study, we used a multivariate generalised linear mixed model to investigate the ecological factors that determine the prevalence of four recently discovered bumblebee viruses (Mayfield virus 1, Mayfield virus 2, River Liunaeg virus and Loch Morlich virus), and two previously known viruses that infect both wild bumblebees and managed honeybees (Acute bee paralysis virus and Slow bee paralysis virus). We show that the recently discovered bumblebee viruses were more genetically diverse than the viruses shared with honeybees, potentially due to spillover dynamics of shared viruses. We found evidence for ecological drivers of prevalence in our samples, with relatively weak evidence for a positive effect of precipitation on the prevalence of River Luinaeg virus. Coinfection is potentially important in shaping prevalence: we found a strong positive association between River Liunaeg virus and Loch Morlich virus presence after controlling for host species, location and other relevant ecological variables. This study represents a first step in the description of predictors of bumblebee infection in the wild not driven by spillover from honeybees.",

    "abstract": "ABSRACTEscherichia coli is gram-negative bacterium that is a workhorse of the biotechnology industry. The organism has a flexible metabolism and can perform a mixed-acid fermentation under anaerobic conditions. Under these conditions E. coli synthesises a formate hydrogenlyase isoenzyme (FHL-1) that can generate molecular hydrogen and carbon dioxide from formic acid. The reverse reaction is hydrogen-dependent carbon dioxide reduction (HDCR), which has exciting possibilities in bio-based carbon capture and storage if it can be harnessed. In this study, an E. coli host strain was optimised for the production of formate from H2 and CO2 during bacterial growth in a pressurised batch bioreactor. A host strain was engineered that constitutively produced the FHL-1 enzyme and incorporation of tungsten in to the enzyme, in place of molybdenum, helped poise the reaction in the HDCR direction. The engineered E. coli strain showed an ability to grow under fermentative conditions while simultaneously producing formate from gaseous H2 and CO2 supplied in the bioreactor. However, while a sustained pressure of 10 bar N2 had no adverse effect on cell growth, when the culture was placed at or above 4 bar pressure of a H2:CO2 mixture then a clear growth deficiency was observed. Taken together, this work demonstrates that growing cells can be harnessed to hydrogenate carbon dioxide and provides fresh evidence that the FHL-1 enzyme may be intimately linked with bacterial energy metabolism.",

    "abstract": "Long telomeres have become nearly synonymous with a variety of fitness-related traits and may be mediators of ecologically relevant variation in life history strategies. Growing evidence suggests that telomere dynamics are more predictive of performance than length itself, but very little work considers how telomere regulatory mechanisms respond to environmental challenges or influence performance in nature. Here, we combine observational and experimental datasets from free-living tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) to assess how performance is predicted by the telomere regulatory gene POT1, which encodes a shelterin protein that sterically blocks telomerase from repairing the telomere. First, we show that lower POT1 gene expression was associated with higher female quality, i.e. earlier breeding, and heavier body mass. We next challenged mothers with an immune stressor (lipopolysaccharide injection) that led to  sickness in mothers and 24h of food restriction in their offspring. While POT1 did not respond to maternal injection, females with lower constitutive gene expression were better able to maintain feeding rates following treatment. Maternal injection also generated a one-day stressor for chicks, who responded with decreased POT1 gene expression and elongated telomeres. Other putatively stress-responsive mechanisms (i.e. glucocorticoids, antioxidants) were not significantly different between control and stress-exposed chicks. Model comparisons indicated that POT1 mRNA abundance was a largely better predictor of performance than telomere dynamics, indicating that telomere regulators may be powerful modulators of variation in life history strategies.",

    "abstract": "The functions of the long non-coding RNA, Nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (Neat1), are poorly understood. Neat1 is required for the formation of paraspeckles, but its respective paraspeckle-dependent or independent functions are unknown. Several studies including ours reported that Neat1 is involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. We characterized the impact of Neat1 genetic deletion in a rat pituitary cell line. The mRNAs whose circadian expression pattern or expression level is regulated by Neat1 were identified after high-throughput RNA sequencing of the circadian transcriptome of wild-type cells compared to cells in which Neat1 was deleted by CRISPR/Cas9. The numerous RNAs affected by Neat1 deletion were found to be circadian or non-circadian, targets or non-targets of paraspeckles, and to be associated with many key biological processes showing that Neat1, interacting or independently of the circadian system, could play crucial roles in key physiological functions through diverse mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial super-complexes form around a conserved core of monomeric complex I and dimeric complex III; wherein subunit NDUFA11, of the former, is conspicuously situated at the interface. We identified B0491.5 (NDUF-11) as the C. elegans homologue, of which animals homozygous for a CRISPR-Cas9 generated knockout allele arrested at the L2 development stage. Reducing expression by RNAi allowed development to the adult stage, enabling characterisation of the consequences: destabilisation of complex I and its super-complexes, and perturbation of respiratory function. The loss of NADH-dehydrogenase activity is compensated by enhanced complex II activity, resulting in excessive detrimental ROS production. Meanwhile, electron cryo-tomography highlight aberrant cristae morphology and widening of the inter-membrane space and cristae junctions. The requirement of NDUF-11 for balanced respiration, mitochondrial morphology and development highlights the importance of complex I/ super-complex maintenance. Their perturbation by this, or other means, is likely to be the cause of metabolic stress and disease.",

This process is tightly controlled to prevent cell fate changes or aneuploidy, and the core machinery is highly conserved among metazoans. Multiple mechanisms regulate cytokinesis, but their requirement in different cell types is not known. Here, we show that differently fated AB and P1 cells in the early C. elegans embryo have unique cytokinesis kinetics supported by distinct levels and cortical patterning of myosin. Through perturbation of polarity regulators and the generation of stable tetraploid strains, we demonstrate that these differences depend on both cell fate and size. Additionally, these parameters could influence the Ran pathway, which coordinates the contractile ring with chromatin position, and controls cytokinesis differently in AB and P1 cells. Our findings demonstrate the need to consider multiple parameters when modeling ring kinetics.",

    "abstract": "One of the central goals of ecology is to determine the mechanisms that enable coexistence among species. Evidence is accruing that conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD), the process by which plant seedlings are unable to survive in the area surrounding adults of their same species, is a major contributor to tree species coexistence. However, for CNDD to maintain diversity, three conditions must be met. First, CNDD must maintain diversity for the majority of the woody plant community (rather than merely specific groups). Second, the pattern of repelled recruitment must increase in with plant size. Third, CNDD must occurs across life history strategies and not be restricted to a single life history strategy. These three conditions are rarely tested simultaneously. In this study, we simultaneously test all three conditions in a woody plant community in a North American temperate forest. We examined whether the different woody plant growth forms (shrubs, understory trees, mid-story trees, canopy trees, and lianas) at different ontogenetic stages (seedling, sapling, and adult) were overdispersed - a spatial pattern indicative of CNDD - using spatial point pattern analysis across life history stages and strategies. We found that there was a strong signal of overdispersal at the community level. However, this pattern was driven by adult canopy trees. By contrast, understory plants, which can constitute up to 80% of temperate forest plant diversity, were not overdispersed as adults. The lack of overdispersal suggests that CNDD is unlikely to be a major mechanism maintaining understory plant diversity. The focus on trees for the vast majority of CNDD studies may have biased the perception of the prevalence of CNDD as a dominant mechanism that maintains community-level diversity when, according to our data, CNDD may be restricted largely to trees.",

    "abstract": "One of the oldest and most persistent questions in ecology and evolution is whether natural communities tend to evolve toward saturation and maximal diversity. Robert MacArthurs classical theory of niche packing and the theory of adaptive radiations both imply that populations will diversify and fully partition any available niche space. However, the saturation of natural populations is still very much an open area of debate and investigation. Additionally, recent evolutionary theory suggests the existence of alternative evolutionary stable states (ESSs), which implies that some stable communities may not be fully saturated. Using models with classical Lokta-Volterra ecological dynamics and three formulations of evolutionary dynamics (a model using adaptive dynamics, an individual-based model, and a partial differential equation model), we show that following an adaptive radiation, communities can often get stuck in low diversity states when limited by mutations of small phenotypic effect. These low diversity metastable states can also be maintained by limited resources and finite population sizes. When small mutations and finite populations are considered together, it is clear that despite the presence of higher-diversity stable states, natural populations are likely not fully saturating their environment and leaving potential niche space unfilled. Additionally, within-species variation can further reduce community diversity from levels predicted by models that assume species-level homogeneity.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding if and when communities evolve to saturate their local environments is imperative to our understanding of natural populations. Using computer simulations of classical evolutionary models, we study whether adaptive radiations tend to lead toward saturated communities, in which no new species can invade or remain trapped in alternative, lower diversity stable states. We show that with asymmetric competition and small effect mutations, evolutionary Red Queen dynamics can trap communities in low diversity metastable states. Moreover, limited resources not only reduces community population sizes, but also reduces community diversity, denying the formation of saturated communities and stabilizing low diversity, non-stationary evolutionary dynamics. Our results are directly relevant to the longstanding questions important to both ecological empiricists and theoreticians on the species packing and saturation of natural environments. Also, by showing the ease evolution can trap communities in low diversity metastable states, we demonstrate the potential harm in relying solely on ESSs to answer questions of biodiversity.",

    "abstract": "Immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays play a central role in evaluating biomarker expression in tissue sections for diagnostic and research applications. Manual scoring of IHC images, which is the current standard of practice, is known to have several shortcomings in terms of reproducibility and scalability to large scale studies. Here, by using a digital image analysis-based approach, we introduce a new metric called the pixelwise H-score (pix H-score) that quantifies biomarker expression from whole-slide scanned IHC images. The pix H-score is an unsupervised algorithm that only requires the specification of intensity thresholds for the biomarker and the nuclear-counterstain channels. We present the detailed implementation of the pix H-score in two different whole-slide image analysis software packages Visiopharm and HALO. We consider three biomarkers P-cadherin, PD-L1, and 5T4, and show how the pix H-score exhibits tight concordance to multiple orthogonal measurements of biomarker abundance such as the biomarker mRNA transcript and the pathologist H-score. We also compare the pix H-score to existing automated image analysis algorithms and demonstrate that the pix H-score provides either comparable or significantly better performance over these methodologies. We also present results of an empirical resampling approach to assess the performance of the pix H-score in estimating biomarker abundance from select regions within the tumor tissue relative to the whole tumor resection. We anticipate that the new metric will be broadly applicable to quantify biomarker expression from a wide variety of IHC images. Moreover, these results underscore the benefit of digital image analysis-based approaches which offer an objective, reproducible, and highly scalable strategy to quantitatively analyze IHC images.",

The study aims to investigate the occurrence and characteristics of co-infection and secondary infection in COVID-19 patients, mainly focusing on Streptococcus pneumoniae co-infections.\n\nMethodsThis study was a prospective, observational cohort study of the inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 in two designated hospitals in south China enrolled between Jan 11 and Feb 22, 2020. The urine specimen was collected on admission and applied for pneumococcal urinary antigen tests (PUATs). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data of patients were recorded simultaneously.\n\nResultA total of 146 patients with a confirm diagnosis of COVID-19 at the median age of 50.0 years (IQR 36.0-61.0) were enrolled, in which, 16 (11.0%) were classified as severe cases and 130 (89.0%) as non-severe cases. Of the enrolled patients, only 3 (2.1%) were considered to present the co-infection, in which 1 was co-infected with S.pneumoniae, 1 with B.

Secondary infection occurred in 16 patients, with S. maltophilia as the most commonly isolated pathogen (43.8%), followed by P. aeruginosa (25.0%), E. aerogenes (25.0%), C. parapsilosis (25.0%) and A. fumigates (18.8%).\n\nConclusionPatients with confirmed COVID-19 were rarely co-infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae or other pathogens, indicating that the application of antibiotics against CAP on admission may not be necessary in the treatment of COVID-19 cases.",

Fourier and univariate wavelet analyses inform on periodicity and extent of change. Evaluating time-lagged data sets of various lag lengths, we find that the autocorrelation function, average mutual information and box counting dimension represent good quantitative readouts for the progression of new infections. Bivariate wavelet analysis and return plots give indications of containment versus exacerbation. Homogeneity or heterogeneity in the population response, uptick versus suppression, and worsening or improving trends are discernible, in part by plotting various time lags in three dimensions.

It is proposed that heterogeneity among the vulnerable is a significant factor in the contagion impact of COVID-19, as demonstrated with incidence rates on a Diamond Princess Cruise ship in February 2020. Given the nature of the disease, its heterogeneity and human social norms, pre-voyage and post-voyage quick testing procedures may become the new standard for cruise ship passengers and crew. The technological advances in testing available today would facilitate more humanistic treatment as compared to more archaic quarantine and isolation practices for all onboard ship. With quick testing, identification of those infected and thus not allowed to embark on a cruise or quarantining those disembarking and other mitigation strategies, the popular cruise adventure could be available safely again.

Global optimization generates a single network linking most observed ion peaks, enhances peak assignment accuracy, and produces chemically-informative peak-peak relationships, including for peaks lacking MS/MS spectra. Applying this approach to yeast and mouse data, we identified five novel metabolites (thiamine derivatives and N-glucosyl-taurine).

    "abstract": "Neutrophils must navigate accurately towards pathogens in order to destroy invaders and thus defend our bodies against infection. Here we show that hydrogen peroxide, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant, guides chemotaxis by activating calcium-permeable TRPM2 ion channels and thus generating an intracellular leading-edge calcium \"pulse\". The thermal sensitivity of TRPM2 activation means that chemotaxis towards hydrogen peroxide is strongly promoted by small temperature elevations, suggesting that an important function of fever may be to enhance neutrophil chemotaxis by facilitating calcium influx through TRPM2. Chemotaxis towards conventional chemoattractants such as LPS, CXCL2 and C5a does not depend on TRPM2 but is driven in a similar way by leading-edge calcium pulses. Other proposed initiators of neutrophil movement, such as PI3K, Rac and lyn, influence chemotaxis by modulating the amplitude of calcium pulses. We propose that intracellular leading-edge calcium pulses are universal drivers of the motile machinery involved in neutrophil chemotaxis.",

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) are crucial for a variety of motor and cognitive functions. Changes induced by persistent low-dopamine (e.g. in Parkinsons disease), result in aberrant changes in steady-state population activity ({beta}-band oscillations) and transient response of the BG. Typically, brief cortical stimulation results in a triphasic response in the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr, output of the BG). The properties of the triphasic responses are shaped by dopamine levels. While it is relatively well understood how changes in BG result in aberrant steady state activity, it is not clear which BG interactions are crucial for the aberrant transient responses in the BG. Moreover, it is also not clear whether the same or different mechanisms underlie the aberrant changes in steady-state activity and aberrant transient response. Here we used numerical simulations of a network model of BG to identify the key factors that determine the shape of the transient responses. We show that an aberrant transient response of the SNr in low-dopamine state, involves changes in both, the direct pathway and the recurrent interactions within the globus pallidus externa (GPe) and between GPe and sub-thalamic nucleus. We found that the connections from D2-type spiny projection neurons to GPe are most crucial in shaping the transient response and by restoring them to their healthy level, we could restore the shape of transient response even in low-dopamine state. Finally, we show that the changes in BG that result in aberrant transient response are also sufficient to generate pathological oscillatory activity.\n\nSignificance statementTo understand how changes induced by low-dopamine (e.g. in Parkinsons disease, PD) affect basal ganglia (BG) function, we need to identify the factors that determine the shape of BG responses to brief cortical stimuli. We show that transient response of the BG is also affected by recurrent interactions within the subnuclei of the BG, and not just feedforward pathways. We found that input and local connectivity within the globus pallidus externa are crucial for shaping the transient response. We also show that the same network changes may underlie both, pathological {beta}-band oscillations and aberrant transient responses. Our results highlight the importance of the recurrent connectivity within the BG and provide a coherent view of emergence of pathological activity in PD.",

    "abstract": "Quiescence is a cellular state characterised by reversible cell-cycle arrest and diminished biosynthetic activity that protects against environmental insults, replicative exhaustion and proliferation-induced mutations1. Entry into and exit from this state controls development, maintenance and repair of tissues plus, in the adult central nervous system, generation of new neurons and thus cognition and mood2-4. Cancer stem cells too can undergo quiescence, which confers them resistance to current therapies5, 6. Despite clinical relevance, quiescence is poorly understood and is defined functionally given lack of molecular markers. Decrease of the most resource-intensive cellular process of protein synthesis is a feature of quiescence, controlled across species and cell types by inhibition of the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) pathway1, 7. Here, we combine Drosophila genetics and a mammalian model to show that altered nucleocytoplasmic partitioning and nuclear accumulation of polyadenylated RNAs are novel evolutionarily conserved hallmarks of quiescence regulation. Furthermore, nuclear accumulation of messenger RNA (mRNA) in quiescent NSCs (qNSCs) largely predicts protein downregulation, accounting for uncoupling between transcriptome and proteome in quiescence. These mechanisms provide a previously unappreciated regulatory layer to reducing protein synthesis in quiescent cells, whilst priming them for reactivation in response to appropriate cues.",

    "abstract": "Domesticated mice and rats have shown to be powerful model systems for biomedical research, but there are cases in which the biology of species is a poor match for the hypotheses under study. The California mouse (Peromyscus californicus) has unique physiological and behavioral traits and has emerged as a powerful model for studying sex differences in the biology of psychiatric disease, which is particularly relevant considering the new NIH guidelines that require the inclusion of sex as a biological variable. Despite its growing role in preclinical research, there is a lack of studies assessing species-specific housing needs, which presents a challenge for research facilities seeking to ensure good welfare and obtaining high-quality experimental data. Indeed, captive California mice present a high prevalence of stereotypic backflipping behavior, a common consequence of suboptimal housing and a potential source of experimental outcome variability. Using three different cage systems, the present studies show that increasing housing space as well as social and environmental complexity can delay the development of stereotypic behavior in male and female California mice. Critically, this reduction in stereotypy is accompanied by increased effect sizes of stress in an established model for social anxiety. These results suggest that increased cage size and enrichment could enhance welfare in California mice while simultaneously increasing the quality of behavioral experiments.",

    "abstract": "Physiological states can determine the ability of organisms to handle stress. Does this mean that the same selection pressure will lead to different evolutionary outcomes, depending on the organisms physiological state? If yes, what will be the genomic signatures of such adaptation(s)? We used experimental evolution in Escherichia coli followed by whole-genome whole-population sequencing to investigate these questions. The sensitivity of Escherichia coli to ultraviolet (UV) radiation depends on the growth phase during which it experiences the radiation. We evolved replicate E. coli populations under two different conditions of UV exposures, namely exposure during the lag and the exponential growth phases. Initially, the UV sensitivity of the ancestor was greater during the exponential phase than the lag phase. However, at the end of 100 cycles of exposure, UV resistance evolved to similar extents in both treatments. Genome analysis showed that mutations in genes involved in DNA repair, cell membrane structure and RNA polymerase were common in both treatments. However, different functional groups were found mutated in populations experiencing lag and exponential UV treatment. In the former, genes involved in transcriptional and translational regulations and cellular transport were mutated, whereas the latter treatment showed mutations in genes involved in signal transduction and cell adhesion. Interestingly, the treatments showed no phenotypic differences in a number of novel environments. Taken together, these results suggest that selection pressures at different physiological stages can lead to differences in the genomic signatures of adaptation, which need not necessarily translate into observable phenotypic differences.",

    "abstract": "Infectious disease forecasting is an emerging field and has the potential to improve public health through anticipatory resource allocation, situational awareness, and mitigation planning. By way of exploring and operationalizing disease forecasting, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted FluSight since the 2013/14 flu season, an annual flu forecasting challenge. Since FluSights onset, forecasters have developed and improved forecasting models in an effort to provide more timely, reliable, and accurate information about the likely progression of the outbreak. While improving the predictive performance of these forecasting models is often the primary objective, it is also important for a forecasting model to run quickly, facilitating further model development, improvement, and scalability. In this vein I introduce Inferno, a fast and accurate flu forecasting model inspired by Dante, the top performing model in the 2018/19 FluSight challenge. When compared to all models that participated in FluSight 2018/19, Inferno would have placed 2nd in both the national and state challenges, behind only Dante. Inferno, however, runs in minutes and is trivially parallelizable, while Dante takes hours to run, representing a significant operational improvement with minimal impact to performance. A future consideration for forecasting competitions like FluSight will be how to encourage improvements to secondarily important properties of forecasting models, such as runtime, generalizability, and interpretability.",
