    "abstract": "Information on peripheral color perception is far from being sufficient since it was predominantly obtained using small stimuli, limited ranges of eccentricities, and sophisticated experimental conditions. Our purpose was to consider a possibility of facilitating technical realization of the classical method of asymmetric color matching (ACM) developed by Moreland and Cruz (1959) for assessing appearance of color stimuli in the peripheral visual field (VF). We adopted the ACM method by employing two smartphones to implement matching procedure at various eccentricities. Although smartphones were successfully employed in vision studies, we are aware that some photometric parameters of smartphone displays are not sufficiently precise to ensure accurate color matching in foveal vision; moreover, certain technical characteristics of commercially available devices are variable. In the present study we provide evidence that, despite these shortages, smartphones can be applied for general and wide investigations of the peripheral vision. In our experiments, the smartphones were mounted on a mechanical perimeter to simultaneously present colored stimuli foveally and peripherally. Trying to reduce essential discomfort and fatigue experienced by most observers in peripheral vision studies, we did not apply bite bars, pupil dilatation, and Maxwellian view. The ACM measurements were performed without prior training of observers and in a wide range of eccentricities, varying between 0 and 95{degrees}. Color appearance was measured in the HSV color space coordinates as a function of eccentricity and stimulus luminance. We demonstrate that our easy-to-conduct method provides a reliable means to estimate color appearance in the peripheral vision and to assess inter-individual differences.",

    "abstract": "Respiratory viral infections with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza viruses commonly induce a strong infiltration of immune cells into the lung, with potential detrimental effects on the integrity of the lung tissue. Despite comprising the largest fractions of circulating lymphocytes in the lung, little is known about how blood natural killer (NK) cells and T cell subsets are equipped for lung-homing in COVID-19 and influenza. Using 28-colour flow cytometry and re-analysis of published RNA-seq datasets, we provide a detailed comparative analysis of NK cells and T cells in peripheral blood from moderately sick COVID-19 and influenza patients, focusing on the expression of chemokine receptors known to be involved in leukocyte recruitment to the lung. The results reveal a predominant role for CXCR3, CXCR6, and CCR5 in COVID-19 and influenza patients, mirrored by scRNA-seq signatures in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavage from publicly available datasets. NK cells and T cells expressing lung-homing receptors displayed stronger phenotypic signs of activation as compared to cells lacking lung-homing receptors, and activation was overall stronger in influenza as compared to COVID-19. Together, our results indicate migration of functionally competent CXCR3+, CXCR6+, and/or CCR5+ NK cells and T cells to the lungs in moderate COVID-19 and influenza patients, identifying potential common targets for future therapeutic interventions in respiratory viral infections.\n\nAuthor summaryThe composition of in particular CXCR3+ and/or CXCR6+ NK cells and T cells is altered in peripheral blood upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza virus in patients with moderate disease. Lung-homing receptor-expression is biased towards phenotypically activated NK cells and T cells, suggesting a functional role for these cells co-expressing in particular CXCR3 and/or CXCR6 upon homing towards the lung.",

Using this approach, we identified a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in the United States (U.S.). The earliest sequenced genomes of this variant, referred to as 20C-US, can be traced to Texas in late May of 2020. This variant circulated in the U.S. uncharacterized for months and rose to recent prevalence during the third pandemic wave. It initially acquired five novel, relatively unique non-synonymous mutations. 20C-US is continuing to acquire multiple new mutations, including three independently occurring spike protein mutations.

    "abstract": "Akin to short-hairpin RNAs and antisense oligonucleotides which efficaciously recruit endogenous cellular machinery such as Argonaute and RNase H to enable targeted RNA knockdown, simple long antisense guide RNAs (1) can recruit endogenous adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs) to enable programmable A-to-I RNA editing, without requiring co-delivery of any exogenous proteins. This approach is highly specific, however the efficiency is typically lower than observed with enzyme overexpression. Conjecturing this was due in part to the short half-life and residence times of guide RNAs, here we engineer highly stable circular ADAR recruiting guide RNAs (cadRNAs), which can be delivered not only by genetically encoding on DNA vectors, but also via transfection of RNA molecules transcribed in vitro. Using these cadRNAs, we observed robust RNA editing across multiple sites and cell lines, in both untranslated and coding regions of RNAs, vastly improved efficiency and durability of RNA editing, and high transcriptome-wide specificity. High transcript-level specificity was achieved by further engineering to reduce bystander editing. Additionally, in vivo delivery of cadRNAs via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) enabled robust 38% RNA editing of the mPCSK9 transcript in C57BL/6J mice livers, and 12% UAG-to-UGG RNA correction of the amber nonsense mutation in the IDUA-W392X mouse model of mucopolysaccharidosis type I-Hurler (MPS I-H) syndrome. Taken together, cadRNAs enable efficacious programmable RNA editing with application across diverse protein modulation and gene therapeutic settings.",

    "abstract": "Animal models recapitulating distinctive features of severe COVID-19 are critical to enhance our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under the cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The precise mechanisms of lethality in this mouse model remain unclear. Here, we evaluated the spatiotemporal dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection for up to 14 days post-infection. Despite infection and moderate pneumonia, rapid clinical decline or death of mice was invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion and direct neuronal injury (including brain and spinal neurons). Neuroinvasion was observed as early as 4 dpi, with virus initially restricted to the olfactory bulb supporting axonal transport via the olfactory neuroepithelium as the earliest portal of entry. No evidence of viremia was detected suggesting neuroinvasion occurs independently of entry across the blood brain barrier. SARS-CoV-2 tropism was not restricted to ACE2-expressing cells (e.g., AT1 pneumocytes), and some ACE2-positive lineages were not associated with the presence of viral antigen (e.g., bronchiolar epithelium and brain capillaries). Detectable ACE2 expression was not observed in neurons, supporting overexpression of ACE2 in the nasal passages and neuroepithelium as more likely determinants of neuroinvasion in the K18-hACE2 model. Although our work incites caution in the utility of the K18-hACE2 model to study global aspects of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, it underscores this model as a unique platform for exploring the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis that may have clinical relevance acknowledging the growing body of evidence that suggests COVID-19 may result in long-standing neurologic consequences.\n\nIMPORTANCECOVID-19 is predominantly a respiratory disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that has infected more than 191 million people with over 4 million fatalities (2021-07-20). The development of animal models recapitulating distinctive features of severe COVID-19 is critical to enhancing our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and in the evaluation of vaccine and therapeutic efficacy. Transgenic mice expressing human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) under the cytokeratin 18 promoter (K18-hACE2) represent a lethal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we show lethality of this model is invariably associated with viral neuroinvasion linked with viral replication and assembly. Importantly, pneumonia albeit invariably present was generally moderate with the absence of culturable infectious virus at peak neuroinvasion. The dynamics of viral neuroinvasion and pneumonia were only partially dependent on hACE2. Overall, this study provides an in-depth sequential characterization of the K18-hACE2 model following SARS-CoV-2 infection, highlighting its significance to further study the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 neuropathogenesis.",

Two-hundred and seventeen individuals of the LABC-01 population at BC2F3:4 generation were screened for the race 0 of anthracnose (Colletotrichum lentis) and stemphylium blight (Stemphylium botryosum) under controlled conditions. The population showed significant variations for both diseases and transfer of resistance alleles into the elite cultivar was evident. It also segregated for other traits such as days to flowering, seed coat colour, seed coat pattern and flower colour.

Here we utilize an inducible ectopic microtubule nucleation site in the nucleus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study three necessary steps in the formation of a bipolar array: the recruitment of the {gamma}-tubulin complex, nucleation and elongation of microtubules, and the organization of microtubules relative to each other. This novel tool, an Spc110 chimera, reveals previously unreported roles of the microtubule-associated proteins Stu2, Bim1, and Bik1, and the motors Vik1 and Kip3. We report that Stu2 and Bim1 are required for nucleation and that Bik1 and Kip3 promote nucleation at the ectopic site. Stu2, Bim1, and Kip3 join their homologs XMAP215, EB1 and kinesin-8 as promoters of microtubule nucleation, while Bik1 promotes MT nucleation indirectly via its role in SPB positioning. Further, we find that the nucleation activity of Stu2 in vivo correlates with its polymerase activity in vitro. Finally, we provide the first evidence that Vik1, a subunit of Kar3/Vik1 kinesin-14, promotes microtubule minus end focusing at the ectopic site.",

Comparing young adult with older adult mice, new protein incorporation was reduced in all tissues. STRING clustering revealed epigenetic modulation across all tissues, a decline in chondroprotective growth factors such as FGF2 and TGFb in cartilage, and clusters indicating mitochondrial dysregulation and reduced collagen synthesis in bone. Several of these pathways have been associated with age-related disease. Fewer changes were observed for skin and plasma.

The adipo-renal axis involves adipocyte release of signaling molecules that are recruited to kidney and regulate kidney function.

Here, the transgenic mice overexpressing DsbA-L protein in fat (fDsbA-L) were used to verify that the renoprotective role of DsbA-L whether by adipo-renal axis. Mice were divided into four groups: a normal (Control) group, STZ induced diabetic mice, fDsbA-L mice and diabetic fDsbA-L mice (n=6). Diabetes was induced in mice by STZ 100mg/kg and continued HFD feeding for 12 weeks. Compared with the control group, the weight, blood glucose,and urine protein levels and the pathological changes in the kidney tissue of diabetic mice were increased significantly, accompanied by increased NLRP3,caspase-1, IL-1{beta}, IL-18, FN, and Collagen1 mRNA and protein expression, which were reduced in diabetic fDsbA-L mice. Interestingly, the level of adiponectin in serum and kidney expression in diabetic mice was reduced significantly compared to that in the control group. However this change was reversed in diabetic fDsbA-L mice. These data suggest that the overexpression of DsbA-L in the adipocytes of mice can protect against diabetic renal injury through anti-inflammatory mediators,and may be mediated by the adipo-renal axis.",

    "abstract": "G proteins were originally discovered through efforts to understand the effects of hormones, such as glucagon and epinephrine, on glucose metabolism. On the other hand, many cellular metabolites, including glucose, serve as ligands for G protein-coupled receptors. Here we investigate the consequences of glucose-mediated receptor signaling, and in particular the role of a G subunit Gpa2 and a non-canonical G{beta} subunit, known as Asc1 in yeast and RACK1 in animals. Asc1/RACK1 is of particular interest because it has multiple, seemingly unrelated, functions in the cell. The existence of such \"moonlighting\" operations has complicated the determination of phenotype from genotype. Through a comparative analysis of individual gene deletion mutants, and by integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics measurements, we have determined the relative contributions of the G and G{beta} protein subunits to glucose-initiated processes in yeast. We determined that Gpa2 is primarily involved in regulating sugar metabolism while Asc1 is primarily involved in amino acid metabolism. Both proteins are involved in regulating purine metabolism. Of the two subunits, Gpa2 regulates a greater number of gene transcripts and was particularly important in determining the amplitude of response to glucose addition. We conclude that the two G protein subunits regulate distinct but complementary processes downstream of the glucose-sensing receptor, as well as processes that lead ultimately to changes in cell growth and metabolism.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYDespite the societal importance of glucose fermentation in yeast, the mechanisms by which these cells detect and respond to glucose have remained obscure. Glucose detection requires a cell surface receptor coupled to a G protein that is comprised of two subunits, rather than the more typical heterotrimer: an  subunit Gpa2 and the {beta} subunit Asc1 (or RACK1 in humans). Asc1/RACK1 also serves as a subunit of the ribosome, where it regulates the synthesis of proteins involved in glucose fermentation. This manuscript uses global metabolomics and transcriptomics to demonstrate the distinct roles of each G protein subunit in transmitting the glucose signal. Whereas Gpa2 is primarily involved in the metabolism of sugars, Asc1/RACK1 contributes to production of amino acids necessary for protein synthesis and cell division. These findings reveal the initial steps of glucose signaling and several unique and complementary functions of the G protein subunits. More broadly, the integrated approach used here is likely to guide efforts to determine the topology of complex G protein and metabolic signaling networks in humans.",

    "abstract": "Molecular chaperones maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis) by ensuring the proper folding of polypeptides. Loss of proteostasis has been linked to the onset of numerous neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimers, Parkinsons, and Huntingtons disease. Hsp110 is related to the canonical Hsp70 class of protein folding molecular chaperones and interacts with Hsp70 as a nucleotide exchange factor (NEF), promoting rapid cycling of ADP for ATP. In addition to its NEF activity, Hsp110 possesses an Hsp70-like substrate binding domain (SBD) whose biological roles remain undefined. Previous work in Drosophila melanogaster has shown that loss of the sole Hsp110 gene (Hsc70cb) accelerates the aggregation of polyglutamine (polyQ)-expanded human Huntingtin, while its overexpression protects against polyQ-mediated neuronal cell death. We hypothesize that in addition to its role as an Hsp70 NEF, Drosophila Hsp110 may function in the fly as a protective protein \"holdase\", preventing the aggregation of unfolded polypeptides via the SBD-{beta} subdomain. Using an in vitro protein aggregation assay we demonstrate for the first time that Drosophila Hsp110 effectively prevents aggregation of the model substrate citrate synthase. We also report the discovery of a redundant and heretofore unknown potent holdase capacity in a 138 amino-acid region of Hsp110 carboxyl-terminal to both SBD-{beta} and SBD- (henceforth called the C-terminal extension). This sequence is highly conserved in metazoan Hsp110 genes, completely absent from fungal representatives, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae SSE1, and is computationally predicted to contain an intrinsically disordered region (IDR). We demonstrate that this IDR sequence within the human Hsp110s, Apg-1 and Hsp105, inhibits the formation of amyloid A{beta}-42 and -synuclein fibrils in vitro but cannot mediate fibril disassembly. Together these findings demonstrate the existence of a second independent, passive holdase property of metazoan Hsp110 chaperones capable of suppressing both general protein aggregation and amyloidogenesis and raise the possibility of exploitation of this IDR for therapeutic benefit in combating neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "Structural variant (SV) calling belongs to the standard tools of modern bioinformatics for identifying and describing alterations in genomes. Initially, this work presents several complex genomic rearrangements that reveal conceptual ambiguities inherent to the SV representations of state-of-the-art SV callers. We contextualize these ambiguities theoretically as well as practically and propose a graph-based approach for resolving them. Our graph model unifies both genomic strands by using the concept of skew-symmetry; it supports graph genomes in general and pan genomes in specific. Instances of our model are inferred directly from seeds instead of the commonly used alignments that conflict with various types of SV as reported here. For yeast genomes, we practically compute adjacency matrices of our graph model and demonstrate that they provide highly accurate descriptions of one genome in terms of another.

We conducted a structural characterization of mAbs against the N-terminal domain of nucleocapsid protein (NPNTD) from SARS-CoV-2 using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Our solution-based results distinguished the mAbs flexibility and how this flexibility impacts the assembly of multiple mAbs on an antigen. By pairing two mAbs that bind different epitopes on the NPNTD, we show that flexible mAbs form a closed sandwich-like complex. With rigid mAbs, a juxtaposition of the Fabs is prevented, enforcing a linear arrangement of the mAb pair, which facilitates further mAb polymerization. In a modified sandwich ELISA, we show the rigid mAb-pairings with linear polymerization led to increased NPNTD detection sensitivity. These enhancements can expedite the development of more sensitive and selective antigen-detecting point-of-care lateral flow devices (LFA), key for early diagnosis and epidemiological studies of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.",

The alkyladenine glycosylase (AAG) removes methylated bases to initiate the base excision repair (BER) pathway. To understand how gene-environment interactions impact disease susceptibility, we studied Aag-/- and Aag-overexpressing mice that harbor increased levels of either replication-blocking lesions (3-methyladenine, or 3MeA) or strand breaks (BER intermediates), respectively. Remarkably, the disease outcome switched from cancer to lethality simply by changing AAG levels. To understand the underlying basis for this observation, we integrated a suite of molecular, cellular and physiological analyses. We found that unrepaired 3MeA is somewhat toxic but highly mutagenic (promoting cancer), whereas excess strand breaks are poorly mutagenic and highly toxic (suppressing cancer and promoting lethality). We demonstrate that the levels of a single DNA repair protein tips the balance between blocks and breaks, and thus dictates the disease consequences of DNA damage.",

EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase that acts as an oncogene. The data herein show that ARID1A deficient tumors, but not ARID1A wild-type tumors are sensitive to EZH2 inhibition. Specifically, EZH2 inhibitor-treated ARID1A deficient bladder cancer cells show significantly reduced cell viability, colony formation, and in vivo tumor growth relative to ARID1A-wild type bladder cancer cells.

    "abstract": "Extracellular electron transfer (EET) could enable electron uptake into microbial metabolism for the synthesis of complex, energy dense organic molecules from CO2 and renewable electricity1-6 . EET could do this with an efficiency comparable to H2 -oxidation7,8 but without the need for a volatile intermediate and the problems it causes for scale up9. However, naturally occurring electroactive organisms suffer from a number of technical drawbacks. Correcting these will require extensive knowledge of the genetics and mechanisms of electron uptake. To date, studies of electron uptake in electroactive microbes have focused on shared molecular machinery also used for anaerobic mineral reduction, like the Mtr EET complex in the electroactive microbe Shewanella oneidensis MR-110-14. However, this shared machinery cannot explain all features of electron uptake, hindering efforts to engineer electron uptake. To address this, we screened gene disruption mutants for 3,667 genes, representing {approx} 99% of all non-essential genes, from the S. oneidensis whole genome knockout collection using a redox dye oxidation assay as a proxy for electron uptake. Confirmation of electron uptake using electrochemical testing allowed us to identify five genes from S. oneidensis that are indispensable for electron uptake from a cathode. Knockout of each gene eliminates extracellular electron uptake, yet in 4 of the 5 cases produces no significant defect in electron donation to an anode, highlighting a distinct role for these loci in electron uptake vs. donation. This result highlights an electronic connection between aerobic and anaerobic electron transport chains that allow electrons from the reversible EET machinery to be coupled to different respiratory processes in S. oneidensis. Furthermore, we find homologs to these genes across many different genera suggesting that electron uptake by EET coupled to respiration could be a widespread phenomenon. These gene discoveries provide a foundation for studying this phenotype in exotic metal-oxidizing autotrophic microbes. Additionally, we anticipate that the characterization of these genes will allow for the genetic improvement of electron uptake in S. oneidensis; and genetically engineering electron uptake into a highly tractable host like E. coli to complement recent advances in synthetic CO2 fixation15.",

    "abstract": "Fungi of the order Mucorales cause mucormycosis, a lethal infection with an incompletely understood pathogenesis. We now demonstrate that Mucorales fungi produce a toxin that plays a central role in virulence. Polyclonal antibodies against this toxin inhibit its ability to damage human cells in vitro, and prevent hypovolemic shock, organ necrosis, and death in mice with mucormycosis. RNAi inhibition of the toxin in Rhizopus delemar, compromises the ability of the fungus to damage host cells and attenuates virulence in mice. This 17 kDa toxin has structural and functional features of the plant toxin, ricin, including the ability to inhibit protein synthesis by its N-glycosylase activity, the existence of a motif that mediates vascular leak, and a lectin sequence. Antibodies against the toxin inhibit R. delemar- or toxin-mediated vascular permeability in vitro and cross-react with ricin. A monoclonal anti-ricin B chain antibody binds to the toxin and also inhibits its ability to cause vascular permeability. Therefore, we propose the name \"mucoricin\" for this toxin. Not only is mucoricin important in the pathogenesis of mucormycosis but our data suggest that a ricin- like toxin is produced by organisms beyond the plant and bacterial kingdoms. Importantly, mucoricin should be a promising therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are obligate anaerobes that can couple their growth to the reduction of sulfate. Despite the importance of SRB to global nutrient cycles and their damage to the petroleum industry, our molecular understanding of their physiology remains limited. To systematically provide new insights into SRB biology, we generated a randomly barcoded transposon mutant library in the model SRB Desulfovibrio vulgaris Hildenborough (DvH) and used this genome-wide resource to assay the importance of its genes under a range of metabolic and stress conditions. In addition to defining the essential gene set of DvH, we identified a conditional phenotype for 1,137 non-essential genes. Through examination of these conditional phenotypes, we were able to make a number of novel insights into our molecular understanding of DvH, including how this bacterium synthesizes vitamins. For example, we identified DVU0867 as an atypical L-aspartate decarboxylase required for the synthesis of pantothenic acid, provided the first experimental evidence that biotin synthesis in DvH occurs via a specialized acyl carrier protein and without methyl esters, and demonstrated that the uncharacterized dehydrogenase DVU0826:DVU0827 is necessary for the synthesis of pyridoxal phosphate. In addition, we used the mutant fitness data to identify genes involved in the assimilation of diverse nitrogen sources, and gained insights into the mechanism of inhibition of chlorate and molybdate. Our large-scale fitness dataset and RB-TnSeq mutant library are community-wide resources that can be used to generate further testable hypotheses into the gene functions of this environmentally and industrially important group of bacteria.",

However, how the cells finely control these processes in space and time to ensure proper pigmentation remains unclear. Here, we show that a component of the cytoplasmic dynein complex, Dynlt3, is required for efficient melanosome transport, maturation and transfer. In melanocytes with decreased levels of Dynlt3, pigmented melanosomes undergo a more directional (convective) motion leading to their peripheral location in the cell, and are not fully matured. Stage IV melanosomes are more acidic, but still heavily pigmented, resulting in a less efficient melanosome transfer. Finally, the level of Dynlt3 is dependent on {beta}-catenin activity, revealing a novel function of the Wnt/{beta}-catenin signalling pathway during melanocyte and skin pigmentation, by coupling the transport, position and maturation of melanosomes required for their transfer.",

Yet, it remains unclear which network topologies and selection regimes enhance such trait complementarity. To address this, we simulate coevolution in topologically-distinct net-works under a gradient of mutualistic selection strength. We describe three main insights. First, trait matching is jointly influenced by the strength of mutualistic selection and the structural properties of the network where coevolution is unfolding. Second, the strength of mutualistic selection determines the network descriptors better correlated with higher trait matching. When coevolution is weak, network modularity enhances trait matching, but when it is strong, network connectance amplifies trait matching. Third, the structural properties of networks outrank those of modules or species in determining the evolved degree of trait matching. Our findings suggest networks can both enhance or constrain trait complementary, depending on the strength of mutualistic selection.",

Response thresholds to task-specific stimuli proximally regulate behavioral specialization but their neurobiological regulation is not understood. Here, we show that response thresholds to task-relevant stimuli correspond to the specialization of three behavioral phenotypes of honeybee workers. Quantitative neuropeptidome comparisons suggest two tachykinin-related peptides (TRP2 and TRP3) as candidates for the modification of these response thresholds. Based on our characterization of their receptor binding and downstream signaling, we then confirm the functional role of tachykinins: TRP2 injection and RNAi cause consistent, opposite effects on responsiveness to task-specific stimuli of each behaviorally specialized phenotype but not to stimuli that are unrelated to their tasks. Thus, our study demonstrates that TRP-signaling regulates the degree of task-specific responsiveness of specialized honeybee workers and may control the context-specificity of behavior in animals more generally.",

Moreover, our analyses revealed that isolation in sky islands have also led to extraordinary genetic fragmentation and contributed to reduce local levels of genetic diversity.\n\nMain conclusionsThis study exemplifies the potential of integrating genomic and environmental niche modelling data across biological and spatial replicates to determine whether organisms with similar habitat requirements have experienced concerted/idiosyncratic responses to Quaternary climatic oscillations, which can ultimately help to reach more general conclusions about the vulnerability of mountain biodiversity hotspots to ongoing climate warming.",

    "abstract": "DNA sequences that are exactly conserved over long evolutionary time scales have been observed in a variety of taxa. Such sequences are likely under strong functional constraint and they have been useful in the field of comparative genomics for identifying genome regions with regulatory function. A potential new application for these ultra-conserved elements has emerged in the development of gene drives to control mosquito populations. Many gene drives work by recognising and inserting at a specific target sequence in the genome, often imposing a reproductive load as a consequence. They can therefore select for target sequence variants that provide resistance to the drive. Focusing on highly conserved, highly constrained sequences lowers the probability that variant, gene drive-resistant alleles can be tolerated.\n\nHere we search for conserved sequences of 18bp and over in an alignment of 21 Anopheles genomes, spanning an evolutionary timescale of 100 million years, and characterise the resulting sequences according to their location and function. Over 8000 ultra-conserved elements were found across the alignment, with a maximum length of 164 bp. Length-corrected gene ontology analysis revealed that genes containing Anopheles ultra-conserved elements were over-represented in categories with structural or nucleotide binding functions. Known insect transcription factor binding sites were found in 48% of intergenic Anopheles ultra-conserved elements. When we looked at the genome sequences of 1142 wild-caught mosquitoes we found that 15% of the Anopheles ultra-conserved elements contained no polymorphisms. Our list of Anopheles ultra-conserved elements should provide a valuable starting point for the selection and testing of new targets for gene-drive modification in the mosquitoes that transmit malaria.",

    "abstract": "The Botryosphaeriaceae is a fungal family that includes many destructive vascular pathogens of woody plants (e.g., Botryosphaeria dieback of grape, Panicle blight of pistachio). Species in the genera Botryosphaeria, Diplodia, Dothiorella, Lasiodiplodia, Neofusicoccum, and Neoscytalidium attack a range of horticultural crops, but they vary in virulence and in their abilities to infect their hosts via different infection courts (flowers, green shoots, woody twigs). Isolates of seventeen species, originating from symptomatic apricot, grape, pistachio, and walnut were tested for pathogenicity to grapevine wood after four months of incubation in potted plants in the greenhouse. Results revealed significant variation in virulence in terms of the length of the internal wood lesions caused by these seventeen species. Phylogenomic comparisons of the seventeen species of wood-colonizing fungi revealed clade-specific expansion of gene families representing putative virulence factors involved in toxin production and mobilization, wood degradation, and nutrient uptake. Statistical analyses of the evolution of the size of gene families revealed expansions of secondary metabolism and transporter gene families in Lasiodiplodia and of secreted cell wall degrading enzymes (CAZymes) in Botryosphaeria and Neofusicoccum genomes. In contrast, Diplodia, Dothiorella, and Neoscytalidium generally showed a contraction in the number of members of these gene families. Overall, species with expansions of gene families, such as secreted CAZymes, secondary metabolism, and transporters, were the most virulent (i.e., were associated with the largest lesions), based on our pathogenicity tests and published reports. This study represents the first comparative phylogenomic investigation into the evolution of possible virulence factors from diverse, cosmopolitan members of the Botryosphaeriaceae.",

    "abstract": "Microcalcifications (MCs) are important disease markers for breast cancer. Many studies were conducted on their characterization in female breast cancer (FBC), but no information is available on their composition in male breast cancer (MBC). Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a molecular spectroscopy technique that can explore the biochemical composition of MCs rapidly and without requiring any staining protocol. We here compared, by Raman spectroscopy, the MCs identified on breast cancer pieces from male and female patients. In this study, we used Raman spectroscopy to analyse 41 microcalcifications from 5 invasive MBC patients and 149 MCs from 14 invasive FBC patients. Our findings show that hydroxyapatite is the most abundant type of calcium both in MBC and FBC. However, some differences in the amount and distribution of calcium minerals are present between the two groups. Besides, we observed that MCs in MBC have a higher amount of organic material (collagen) than FBC.\n\nThis study provides the first overview of the composition of microcalcifications present in MBC and suggests that they have several specific features. Our result support the need for studies specifically designed to the understanding of MBC.",

    "abstract": "Obesity causes a number of systemic alterations including chronic inflammation and changes in gut microbiome. However, whether these actively contribute to poor survival and therapy resistance in patients with pancreatic cancer remain undetermined. Our current study shows that high fat diet fed pancreatic tumor bearing mice do not respond to standard of care therapy with gemcitabine and paclitaxel when compared to corresponding control diet fed mice. Upon fecal matter transplant from control mice to high fat diet fed mice, the tumors became sensitive to standard of care therapy and showed extensive cell death. Analysis of gut microbiome showed an enrichment of queuosine (Q) producing bacteria in high fat diet fed mice and an enrichment of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) producing bacteria in control diet fed mice. Further, treatment of high fat diet fed animals with SAM recapitulated the observation with lean to obese fecal matter transplant. Additionally, treatment of pancreatic and colon cancer cell lines in vitro with Q promoted resistance to the paclitaxel and oxaliplatin respectively, while treatment with SAM promoted sensitivity to these drugs. Treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with Q showed upregulation PRDX1, that is involved in oxidative stress protection. Analysis of tumor tissues in high fat diet fed mice showed high PRDX1, low apoptosis and increased proliferation, which were reversed upon treatment with SAM as well as by lean to obese fecal matter transplant. In parallel, high fat diet fed mice showed increase in CD133+ treatment refractory population compared to the control animals. Interestingly, treatment with Q in vitro did not enrich for CD133+ population, indicating that Q mediated protection from cell death was independent of enrichment of treatment refractory cells.\n\nThese observations indicated that microbial metabolite Q accumulated in high fat diet fed mice protected tumors from chemotherapy induced oxidative stress by upregulating PRDX1. This protection could be reversed by treatment with SAM. We conclude that relative concentration of S-adenosyl methionine and queuosine in fecal samples of pancreatic cancer patients can be indicative of therapy response in this disease.",

    "abstract": "Nrf1 and Nrf2, as two principal CNC-bZIP transcription factors, regulate similar but different targets involved in a variety of biological functions for maintaining cell homeostasis and organ integrity. Of note, the unique topobiological behavior of Nrf1 makes its functions more complicated than Nrf2, because it is allowed for alternatively transcribing and selectively splicing to yield multiple isoforms (e.g., TCF11, Nrf1). In order to gain a better understanding of their similarities and differences in distinct regulatory profiles, all four distinct cell models for stably expressing TCF11, TCF11{Delta}N, Nrf1 or Nrf2 have been herein established by an Flp-In T-REx-293 system and then identified by transcriptomic sequencing. Further analysis revealed that Nrf1 and TCF11 have similar yet different regulatory profiles, although both contribute basically to positive regulation of their co-targets, which are disparate from those regulated by Nrf2. Such disparity in those gene regulation by Nrf1 and Nrf2 was further corroborated by scrutinizing comprehensive functional annotation of their specific and/or common target genes. Conversely, the mutant TCF11{Delta}N, resulting from a deletion of the N-terminal amino acids 2-156 from TCF11, resembles Nrf2 with the largely consistent structure and function. Interestingly, our further experimental evidence demonstrates that TCF11 acts as a potent tumor-repressor relative to Nrf1, albeit both isoforms possess a congruous capability to prevent malignant growth of tumor and upregulate those genes critical for improving the survival of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.",

    "abstract": "While the major drivers of melanoma initiation, including activation of NRAS/BRAF and loss of PTEN or CDKN2A, have been identified, the role of key transcription factors that impose altered transcriptional states in response to deregulated signaling is not well understood. The POU domain transcription factor BRN2 is a key regulator of melanoma invasion, yet its role in melanoma initiation remains unknown. Here, we show that BRN2 haplo-insufficiency is sufficient to promote melanoma initiation and metastasis, acting as a non-canonical tumor suppressor. Mechanistically, BRN2 directly modulates PTEN expression, and PI3K signaling, to drive tumor initiation and progression. Collectively our results reveal that somatic deletion of one BRN2 allele elicits melanoma initiation and progression.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEHere, we report frequent mono-allelic loss of the transcription factor BRN2 in human cutaneous melanoma metastases. We developed a mouse model for Brn2-deficient melanoma based on the most common alterations (BrafV600E and Pten loss) in human melanoma and established the role of Brn2 as a functional regulator of tumor initiation, tumor growth, and the formation of metastases in vivo. Mechanistically, BRN2 loss increases PI3K-signaling through PTEN repression, either via MITF induction or not. Overall, we describe a novel tumor suppressor of high prevalence in human melanoma that regulates several steps of in vivo melanomagenesis through two previously unknown molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Aphid parasitoids (Hymenoptera; Aphidiidae) were surveyed within grain production landscapes in Victoria, Australia between 2017 and 2018, as well as more sporadically nationwide between 2016 and 2019. In addition, aphidiine records were collated from insect depositories around Australia and online databases. The 5551 specimens recorded constituted a total of 23 species and seven genera. Diaeretiella rapae (MIntosh) was the most common species, representing more than 70% of all aphidiines recorded. This species also showed a greater northerly geographic range than other aphidiines. During sampling between 2017 and 2019, aphidiines were reared from mummies to ascertain host-parasitoid relationships. Diaeretiella rapae was again the most commonly reared parasitoid, although aphidiine preference varied with aphid host and between states and territories. An illustrated dichotomous key to Australian aphidiines in grain production landscapes is provided for the 11 species sampled in our field surveys. This is the first comprehensive review of aphidiines sampled within Australia in over two decades. Knowledge about the diversity and distribution of these parasitoids is important for understanding their impact on current and future invasions of aphid species. In addition, understanding the interactions between grain aphids and their associated parasitoids will further support the inclusion of parasitoid wasps into integrated pest management (IPM) strategies.",

    "abstract": "Pannexin1 (Panx1) is an ATP release channel expressed in neurons and astrocytes that plays important roles in CNS physiology and pathology. Evidence for the involvement of Panx1 in seizures includes the reduction of epileptiform activity and ictal discharges following Panx1 channel blockade or deletion. However, very little is known about the relative contribution of astrocyte and neuronal Panx1 channels to hyperexcitability. To this end, mice with global and cell type specific deletion of Panx1 were used in one in vivo and two in vitro seizure models. In the low-Mg2+ in vitro model, global deletion but not cell-type specific deletion of Panx1 reduced the frequency of epileptiform discharges. This reduced frequency of discharges did not impact the overall power spectra obtained from local field potentials. In the in vitro KA model, in contrast, global or cell type specific deletion of Panx1 did not affect the frequency of discharges, but reduced the overall power spectra. EEG recordings following KA-injection in vivo revealed that although global deletion of Panx1 did not affect the onset of status epilepticus (SE), SE onset was delayed in mice lacking neuronal Panx1 and accelerated in mice lacking astrocyte Panx1. EEG power spectral analysis disclosed a Panx1-dependent cortical region effect; while in the occipital region, overall spectral power was reduced in all three Panx1 genotypes; in the frontal cortex, the overall power was not affected by deletion of Panx1. Together, our results show that the contribution of Panx1 to ictal activity is model, cell-type and brain region dependent.",

    "abstract": "Chicken peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) exhibit wide-ranging cell types, but current understanding of their subclasses, immune cell classification, and function is limited and incomplete. Previously, we found that viremia caused by avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) was eliminated by 21 days post infection (DPI), accompanied by increased CD8+ T cell ratio in PBLs and low antibody levels. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of PBLs in ALV-J infected and control chickens at 21 DPI to determine chicken PBL subsets and their specific molecular and cellular characteristics, before and after viral infection. Eight cell clusters and their potential marker genes were identified in chicken PBLs. T cell populations (clusters 6 and 7) had the strongest response to ALV-J infection at 21 DPI, based on detection of the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). T cell populations of clusters 6 and 7 could be further divided into four subsets: activated CD4+ T cells (cluster A0), Th1-like cells (cluster A2), Th2-like cells (cluster A1), and cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Hallmark genes for each T cell subset response to viral infection were initially identified. Furthermore, pseudotime analysis results suggested that chicken CD4+ T cells could potentially differentiate into Th1-like and Th2-like cells. Moreover, ALV-J infection probably induced CD4+ T cell differentiation into Th1-like cells in which the most immune related DEGs were detected. With respect to the control group, ALV-J infection also had an obvious impact on PBL cell composition. B cells showed inconspicuous response and their numbers decreased in PBLs of the ALV-J infected chickens at 21 DPI. Percentages of cytotoxic Th1-like cells and CD8+ T cells were increased in the T cell population of PBLs from ALV-J infected chicken, which were potentially key mitigating factors against ALV-J infection. More importantly, our results provided a rich resource of gene expression profiles of chicken PBL subsets for a systems-level understanding of their function in homeostatic condition as well as in response to viral infection.",

For hematophagous insects, blood-feeding is a crucial step for offspring development, therefore enteric cells repairing molecular mechanisms consists in fine regulated pathways to counterattack biotic and abiotic insults. Nevertheless, recent research suggests that midgut cells are capable to adapt their immune responses to pathogen challenges. Recently, Anopheles and Aedes mosquitoes have been observed to increase their DNA cell content upon encounter with parasites, bacteria and virus respectively. Genomic endoreplication is one of the most important processes in larval development for fast transcriptional activity and protein secretion.\n\nSo, in this paper we explore the ability of Aedes aegypti Aag-2 culture cells to develop a likely endoreplication process to face pathogen presence. Aag-2 cells at 6 and 12 hours post-biotic insult enter a proliferation arrest and increases DNA content, these two phenomena recovers control levels at 24 h post-treatment. It requires more research data about the type of genomic regions that has been replicated in the process, and the concentration that antimicrobial molecules are released into culture media.",

The sdAbs targeting the cleavage site (CS) and the receptor binding domain (RBD) in S protein efficiently neutralised the infectivity of a pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV2 S protein. Anti-CS sdAb blocked the virus infectivity by inhibiting proteolytic processing of SARS-CoV2 S protein. Both the sdAbs retained characteristic structure within the pH range of 2 to 12 and remained stable upto 65{degrees}C. Furthermore, structural disruptions induced by a high temperature in both the sdAbs were largely reversed upon their gradual cooling and the resulting products neutralised the reporter virus.

Lm was also detected in 10% of human stool samples from an independent cohort of 900 healthy asymptomatic donors. A specific microbiota signature was associated with Lm faecal carriage in human, as well as in experimentally inoculated mice, in which it preceded Lm long-term gut colonization, indicating that gut microbiota composition influences Lm faecal carriage.

    "abstract": "BackgroundSchistosomiasis remains widespread in many regions despite efforts at its elimination. By examining changes in the transcriptome at the host-pathogen interface in the snail Biomphalaria glabrata and the blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni, we previously demonstrated that an early stress response in juvenile snails, manifested by induction of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) and Hsp 90 and of the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of the B. glabrata non-LTR-retrotransposon, nimbus, were critical for B. glabrata susceptibility to S. mansoni. Subsequently, juvenile B. glabrata BS90 snails, resistant to S. mansoni at 25{degrees}C become susceptible by the F2 generation when maintained at 32{degrees}C, indicating an epigenetic response.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsTo better understand this plasticity in susceptibility of the BS90 snail, mRNA sequences were examined from S. mansoni exposed juvenile BS90 snails cultured either at 25{degrees}C (permissive temperature) or 32{degrees}C (non-permissive). Comparative analysis of transcriptomes from snails cultured at the non-permissive and permissive temperatures revealed that whereas stress related transcripts dominated the transcriptome of susceptible BS90 juvenile snails at 32{degrees}C, transcripts encoding proteins with a role in epigenetics, such as PIWI (BgPiwi), chromobox protein homolog 1 (BgCBx1), histone acetyl transferase histone deacetylase (HDAC) and metallotransferase (MT) were highly expressed in those cultured at 25{degrees}C. To further determine a role for BgPiwi in B. glabrata susceptibility to S. mansoni, siRNA corresponding to the BgPiwi encoding transcript was utilized to suppress expression of BgPiwi, rendering the resistant BS90 juvenile snail susceptible to infection at 25{degrees}C. Given transposon silencing activity of PIWI as a facet of its role as guardian of the integrity of the genome, we examined the expression of the nimbus RT encoding transcript at 120 min after infection of resistant BS90 piwi-siRNA treated snails. We observed that nimbus RT was upregulated, indicating that modulation of the transcription of the nimbus RT was associated with susceptibility to S. mansoni in BgPiwi- siRNA treated BS90 snails. Furthermore, treatment of susceptible snails with the RT inhibitor lamivudine, before exposure to S. mansoni, blocked S. mansoni infection concurrent with downregulation of the nimbus RT transcript and upregulation of the BgPiwi encoding transcript in the lamivudine-treated, schistosome-exposed susceptible snails.\n\nConclusions and SignificanceThese findings support a role for the interplay of BgPiwi and nimbus in the epigenetic modulation of plasticity of resistance/susceptibility in the snail-schistosome relationship.",

    "abstract": "Depletion of architectural factors globally alters chromatin structure, but only modestly affects gene expression. We revisit the structure-function relationship using the inactive X chromosome (Xi) as a model. We investigate cohesin imbalances by forcing its depletion or retention using degron-tagged RAD21 (cohesin subunit) or WAPL (cohesin release factor). Interestingly, cohesin loss disrupts Xi superstructure, unveiling superloops between escapee genes, with minimal effect on gene repression. By contrast, forced cohesin retention markedly affects Xi superstructure and compromises spreading of Xist RNA-Polycomb complexes, attenuating Xi silencing. Effects are greatest at distal chromosomal ends, where looping contacts with the Xist locus are weakened. Surprisingly, cohesin loss created an \"Xi superloop\" and cohesin retention created \"Xi megadomains\" on the active X. Across the genome, a proper cohesin balance protects against aberrant inter-chromosomal interactions and tempers Polycomb-mediated repression. We conclude that a balance of cohesin eviction and retention regulates X-inactivation and inter-chromosomal interactions across the genome.",

    "abstract": "Organisms can adapt to an environment by taking multiple mutational paths. This redundancy at the genetic level, where many mutations have similar phenotypic and fitness effects, can make untangling the molecular mechanisms of complex adaptations difficult. Here we use the E. coli long-term evolution experiment (LTEE) as a model to address this challenge. To bridge the gap between disparate genomic changes and parallel fitness gains, we characterize the landscape of transcriptional and translational changes across 11 replicate populations evolving in parallel for 50,000 generations. By quantifying absolute changes in mRNA abundances, we show that not only do all evolved lines have more mRNAs but that this increase in mRNA abundance scales with cell size. We also find that despite few shared mutations at the genetic level, clones from replicate populations in the LTEE are remarkably similar to each other in their gene expression patterns at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Furthermore, we show that the bulk of the expression changes are due to changes at the transcriptional level with very few translational changes. Finally, we show how mutations in transcriptional regulators lead to consistent and parallel changes in the expression levels of downstream genes, thereby linking genomic changes to parallel fitness gains in the LTEE. These results deepen our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying complex adaptations and provide insights into the repeatability of evolution.",

Exemplary is core metabolism reduction as parasites adapt to a particular host, while the accessory genome often maintains a high degree of diversification.

Our analysis reveals converging evolution on biological processes for oomycetes that have similar lifestyle. Besides, we find that certain functions, in particular carbohydrate metabolism, transport, and signaling, are important for host and environmental adaption in oomycetes.\n\nDiscussionGiven the high correlation between lifestyle and genome properties in our oomycete dataset and the convergent evolution of fungal and oomycete genomes, we have developed a model that predicts plant pathogen lifestyles with high accuracy based on functional annotations. Understanding how genomes and selective pressures correlate with lifestyle may be crucial to identify new emerging diseases and pandemic threats.",

Here, we investigated the dynamics of diversification in the cichlid fish Astatotilapia burtoni that diverged along a lake-stream environmental gradient. Whole-genome and morphometric analyses revealed that divergent selection was essential at the early stages of diversification, but that periods in allopatry were likely involved towards the completion of speciation. While morphological differentiation was continuous, genomic differentiation was not, as shown by two clearly separated categories of genomic differentiation. Reproductive isolation increased along a continuum of genomic divergence, with a \"grey zone\" of speciation at [~]0.1% net nucleotide divergence. The quantification of the extent of (non-)parallelism in nine lake-stream population pairs from four cichlid species by means of multivariate analyses revealed one parallel axis of genomic and morphological differentiation among seven lake-stream systems.

    "abstract": "Inferring the ecological and evolutionary processes underlying lineage and phenotypic diversification is of paramount importance to shed light on the origin of contemporary patterns of biological diversity. However, reconstructing phylogenetic relationships in recent evolutionary radiations represents a major challenge due to the frequent co-occurrence of incomplete lineage sorting and introgression. In this study, we combined high throughput sequence data (ddRADseq), geometric morphometric information, and novel phylogenetic inference methods that explicitly account for gene flow to infer the evolutionary relationships and the timing and mode of diversification in a complex of Ibero-Maghrebian montane grasshoppers of the subgenus Dreuxius (genus Omocestus). Our analyses supported the phenotypic distinctiveness of most sister taxa, two events of historical introgression involving lineages at different stages of the diversification continuum, and the recent Pleistocene origin (< 1 Ma) of the complex. Phylogenetic analyses did not recover the reciprocal monophyly of taxa from Iberia and northwestern Africa, supporting overseas migration between the two continents during the Pleistocene. Collectively, these results indicate that periods of isolation and secondary contact linked to Pleistocene glacial cycles likely contributed to both allopatric speciation and post divergence gene flow in the complex. This study exemplifies how the integration of multiple lines of evidence can help to reconstruct complex histories of reticulated evolution and highlights the important role of Quaternary climatic oscillations as a diversification engine in the Ibero-Maghrebian biodiversity hotspot.",

    "abstract": "The males and females of many dioecious plants differ in morphological (Dawson and Geber 1999; Barrett and Hough 2013; Tonnabel et al. 2017), physiological (Juvany and Munne-Bosch 2015), life-history (Delph 1999), and defence traits (Cornelissen and Stiling 2005). Ultimately, such sexual dimorphism must largely be due to differential gene expression between the sexes (Ellegren and Parsch 2007), but little is known about how sex-biased genes are recruited and how their expression evolves over time. We measured gene expression in leaves of males and females of ten species sampled across the South African Cape genus Leucadendron, which shows repeated changes in sexual dimorphism and includes the most extreme differences between males and females in flowering plants (Midgley 2010; Barrett and Hough 2013; Tonnabel et al. 2014). Even in the most dimorphic species in our sample, fewer than 2% of genes showed sex-biased gene expression (SBGE) in vegetative tissue, with surprisingly little correspondence between SBGE and vegetative dimorphism across species. The identity of sex-biased genes in Leucadendron was highly species-specific, with a rapid turnover among species. In animals, sex-biased genes often evolve more quickly than unbiased genes in their sequences and expression levels (Ranz et al. 2003; Khaitovich et al. 2005; Ellegren and Parsch 2007; Voolstra et al. 2007; Harrison et al. 2015; Naqvi et al. 2019), consistent with hypotheses invoking rapid evolution due to sexual selection. Our phylogenetic analysis in Leucadendron, however, clearly indicates that sex-biased genes are recruited from a class of genes with ancestrally rapid rates of expression evolution, perhaps due to low evolutionary or pleiotropic constraints. Nevertheless, we also find evidence for adaptive evolution of expression levels once sex bias evolves. Thus, although the expression of sex-biased genes is ultimately responsive to selection, high rates of expression evolution might usually predate the evolution of sex bias.",

    "abstract": "The ability of aerobic microorganisms to regulate internal and external concentrations of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) superoxide directly influences the health and viability of cells. Superoxide dismutases (SODs) are the primary regulatory enzymes that are used by microorganisms to degrade superoxide. SOD is not one, but three separate, non-homologous enzymes that perform the same function. Thus, the evolutionary history of genes encoding for different SOD enzymes is one of convergent evolution, which reflects environmental selection brought about by an oxygenated atmosphere, changes in metal availability, and opportunistic horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In this study we examine the phylogenetic history of the protein sequence encoding for the nickel-binding metalloform of the SOD enzyme (SodN). A comparison of organismal and SodN protein phylogenetic trees reveals several instances of HGT, including multiple inter-domain transfers of the sodN gene from the bacterial domain to the archaeal domain. Nearly half of the archaeal members with sodN live in the photic zone of the marine water column. The sodN gene is widespread and characterized by apparent vertical gene transfer in some sediment-associated lineages within the Actinobacteriota (Actinobacteria) and Chloroflexota (Chloroflexi) phyla, suggesting the ancestral sodN likely originated in one of these clades before expanding its taxonomic and biogeographic distribution to additional microbial groups in the surface ocean in response to decreasing iron availability. In addition to decreasing iron quotas, nickel-binding SOD has the added benefit of withstanding high reactant and product ROS concentrations without damaging the enzyme, making it particularly well suited for the modern surface ocean.",

The disease is caused by Leptospira of which 605 sequenced genomes representing 72 species are available in RefSeq database. A comparative genomics approach based on Average Amino acid Identity (AAI), Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI), and Insilco DNA-DNA hybridization provide insight that taxonomic and evolutionary position of few genomes needs to be changed and reclassified. Clustering on the basis of AAI of core and pan-genome contradict clustering pattern on basis of ANI into 4 clusters. Amino acid identity based hierarchical clustering clearly established 3 clusters of Leptospira correlating with level of virulence. Whole genome tree supported three cluster classifications and grouped Leptospira into three clades termed as pathogenic, intermediate and saprophytic. Leptospira genus consist of diverse species and exist in heterogeneous environment, it contains relatively large and closed core genome of 1038 genes. Analysis provided pan genome remains open with 20822 genes. COG analysis revealed that mobilome related genes were found mainly in pan-genome of pathogenic clade. Clade specific genes mined in the study can be used as marker for determining clade and associating level of virulence of any new Leptospira species. Many known Leptospira virulent genes were absent in set of 78 virulent factors mined using Virulence Factor database. A deep search approach provided a repertoire of 496 virulent genes in pan-genome. Further validation of virulent genes will help in accurately targeting pathogenic Leptospira and controlling leptospirosis.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/426470v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@104babborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17f727dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35a6c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@56fd53_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Circulating ApoM is inversely associated with mortality in human heart failure (HF).\n\nMethodsIn the Penn HF Study (PHFS), we tested the relationship between ApoM and mortality in a subset with anthracycline-induced cardiomyopathy. We measured ApoM in humans and mice treated with Dox and utilized hepatic ApoM transgenic (ApomTG), ApoM knockout (ApomKO), ApoM knock-in mice with impaired S1P binding, and S1P receptor 3 (S1PR3) knockout mice in Dox cardiotoxicity. We assayed autophagy in left ventricular tissue from anthracycline-induced HF patients versus donor controls.\n\nResultsApoM was inversely associated with mortality in PHFS, and Dox reduced circulating ApoM in mice and breast cancer patients. ApomTG mice were protected from Dox-induced cardiac dysfunction and loss of left ventricular mass. ApomTG attenuated Dox-induced impairment in autophagic flux in vivo and accumulation of insoluble p62, which was also observed in the myocardium of patients with anthracycline-induced HF. In vehicle-treated mice, ApoM negatively regulated transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. The effect of ApoM on TFEB required both S1P binding and S1PR3. In the presence of Dox, ApoM preserved TFEB and cardiomyocyte lysosomal abundance assessed as lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 positive structures in vivo, while S1P mimetic pretreatment of cardiomyocytes prevented Dox-induced changes in lysosomal pH.\n\nConclusionsApoM attenuates Dox cardiotoxicity via the autophagy-lysosome pathway.

    "abstract": "Special Infectious Agent Unit in King Fahd Medical Research Center at King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, has pursed the anti-viral project field to optimize the group of medicinal plants for human-infectious diseases. We have begun virtually in this field since COVID-19 pandemic, besides our divergence in the infectious agents. In this study and based on the previous review, Hypericum perforatum (St. Johns Wort) and Echinacea (gaia HERBS(R)) were tested in vitro using Vero E6 cells for their anti-viral effects against the newly identified Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) through its infectious cycle from 0 to 48 hours post infection. The hypericin (0.9 mg) of H. perforatum and the different parts (roots, seeds, aerial) of two types of Echinacea species (Echinacea purpurea and Echinacea angustifolia) were examined their efficacy in certain concentration and under light-dependent anti-viral activities to measure the inhibition of the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA expression of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) gene and the viral load with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and to assess the neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor binding on cell culture assay. Interestingly, the mixture (H.E.) of 100 mg/mL of H. perforatum and Echinacea was tested too on SARS-CoV-2 and showed crucial anti-viral activity competing H. perforatum then Echinacea effects as anti-viral treatment. Therefore, the results of gaia HERBS(R) products, H. perforatum and Echinacea species, applied in this study showed significant anti-viral and virucidal effects in the following order of potency: H. perforatum, H.E., and Echinacea on SARS-CoV-2 infectious cycle; and will definitely required a set up of clinical trial with specific therapeutic protocol based on the outcome of this study.\n\nAuthor SummaryAfter an outbreak of Rift Valley Fever in the Southern region of Saudi Arabia, particularly in May 2003, Special Infectious Agents Unit (SIAU) was established and founded by Prof. Esam Ibraheem Azhar. This unit contains a full range of facilities including Biosafety Level 3, allows him and his research groups to ambulate and culture risk group 3 viruses in Saudi Arabia & Gulf States for the first time. Since that time, SIAU and our international collaboration have been extended to implement a standard protocols in the infectious agents diagnostics procedure through different mode of collaboration including exchange of expertise, joint research program and more recently a technology transfer agreements with number of international institute sharing same interests. Furthermore, we have been engaged in number of researches related to Hajj & Umrah plus number of national services with the Ministry of Health (MOH) through which, we utilize our Mobile biosafety level 3 Lab to enhance the diagnostics of MERS CoV in the Holly sites during Hajj since 2014.\n\nIn our SIAU and with a powerful team, we have excellent researches made valuable contributions through in vivo and in vitro animal and human studies, and several human viral pathogens which are a threat to global health security due to millions of pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia every year from 182 countries: with particular areas of interests in: Alkhurma Viral Hemorrhagic Fever, Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever Viruses, Rift Valley Fever Virus, MERS-CoV and more recently the new global infectious diseases threat, Sever Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2).",

    "abstract": "Simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) chimeras contain the HIV-1 envelope (env) gene embedded within an SIVmac proviral backbone. Previously, we showed that substitution of Env residue 375-Ser by bulky aromatic residues enhances Env binding to rhesus CD4 and enables primary or transmitted/founder (T/F) HIV-1 Envs to support efficient SHIV replication in rhesus macaques (RMs). Here, we test this design strategy more broadly by constructing and analyzing SHIVs containing ten strategically selected primary or T/F HIV-1 Envs corresponding to subtypes A, B, C, AE and AG, each with six allelic variants at position 375. All ten SHIVs bearing wildtype Env375 residues replicated efficiently in human CD4+ T cells, but only one of these replicated efficiently in rhesus CD4+ T cells. This was a SHIV whose subtype AE Env naturally contained a bulky aromatic His residue at position 375. Replacement of wildtype Env375 residues by Trp, Tyr, Phe or His in the other nine SHIVs uniformly led to efficient replication in rhesus CD4+ T in vitro and in RMs in vivo. Env375-Trp - the residue found most frequently among SIV strains infecting Old World monkeys - was favored for SHIV replication in RMs, although some SHIVs preferred Env375-Tyr, -His or -Phe. Nine SHIVs containing optimized Env375 alleles were grown large scale in primary activated rhesus CD4+ T cells to serve as challenge stocks in preclinical prevention trials. These virus stocks were genetically homogeneous, native-like in Env antigenicity and tier-2 neutralization sensitivity, transmissible by rectal, vaginal, penile, oral or intravenous inoculation routes, and exhibited acute and early replication kinetics that were indistinguishable from HIV-1 infection in humans. Finally, to expedite future SHIV constructions and eliminate short redundant elements in tat1 and env gp41 that were spontaneously deleted in chronically infected monkeys, we engineered a simplified second-generation SHIV design scheme and validated it in RMs. Overall, our findings demonstrate that SHIVs bearing primary or T/F Envs with bulky aromatic amino acid substitutions at position Env375 consistently replicate in RMs, recapitulating many features of HIV-1 infection in humans. We further show that SHIV challenge stocks grown in primary rhesus CD4+ T cells are efficiently transmitted by mucosal routes common to HIV-1 infection and can be used effectively to test for vaccine efficacy in preclinical monkey trials.",

    "abstract": "The cell envelope of Gram-negative bacteria consists of two membranes surrounding a periplasm and peptidoglycan layer. Molecular machines spanning the cell envelope depend on spatial constraints and load-bearing forces across the cell envelope and surface. The mechanisms dictating spatial constraints across the cell envelope remain incompletely defined. In Escherichia coli, the coiled-coil lipoprotein Lpp contributes the only covalent linkage between the outer membrane and the underlying peptidoglycan layer. Using proteomics, molecular dynamics and a synthetic lethal screen we show that lengthening Lpp to the upper limit does not change the spatial constraint, but rather impacts the load-bearing capacity across the outer membrane. Our findings demonstrate E. coli expressing elongated Lpp homeostatically counteracts periplasmic enlargement with a combination of tilting Lpp and reducing Lpp abundance. By genetic screening we identified all of the genes in E. coli that become essential in order to enact this homeostasis, and by quantitative proteomics discovered that very few proteins need to be up- or down-regulated in steady-state levels in order to enact this homeostasis. We observed increased levels of factors determining cell stiffness, decrease membrane integrity, increase membrane vesiculation and a dependance on otherwise non-essential tethers to maintain lipid transport and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. Further this has implications for understanding how spatial constraint across the envelope controls processes such as flagellum-driven motility, cellular signaling and protein translocation",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlant volatiles play an important role in both plant-pollinator and plant-herbivore interactions. Intraspecific polymorphisms in volatile production are ubiquitous, but studies that explore underlying differential gene expression are rare. Oenothera harringtonii populations are polymorphic in floral emission of the monoterpene (R)-(-)-linalool; some plants emit (R)-(-)-linalool (linalool+ plants) while others do not (linalool-plants). However, the genes associated with differential production of this floral volatile in Oenothera are unknown. We used RNA-Seq to broadly characterize differential gene expression involved in (R)-(-)-linalool biosynthesis. To identify genes that may be associated with the polymorphism for this trait, we used RNA-Seq to compare gene expression in six different Oenothera harringtonii tissues from each of three linalool+ and linalool-plants.\n\nResultsThree clusters of differentially expressed genes were enriched for terpene synthase activity: two were characterized by tissue-specific upregulation and one by upregulation only in plants with flowers that produce (R)-(-)-linalool. A molecular phylogeny of all terpene synthases identified two putative (R)-(-)-linalool synthase transcripts in Oenothera harringtonii, a single allele of which is found exclusively in linalool+ plants.\n\nConclusionsBy using a naturally occurring polymorphism and comparing different tissues, we were able to identify genes putatively involved in the biosynthesis of (R)-(-)-linalool. Expression of these genes in linalool-plants suggests a regulatory polymorphism, rather than a population-specific loss-of-function allele. Additional terpene biosynthesis-related genes that are up-regulated in plants that emit (R)-(-)-linalool may be associated with herbivore defense, suggesting a potential economy of scale between plant reproduction and defense.",

    "abstract": "Arsenic is reportedly a biphasic inorganic compound for its toxicity and anticancer effects in humans [1, 2]. Recent studies have shown that certain arsenic compounds including arsenic hexoxide (AS4O6; hereafter, AS6) induce programmed cell death and cell cycle arrest in human cancer cells and murine cancer models [3, 4]. However, the mechanisms by which AS6 suppresses cancer cells are incompletely understood. In this study, we report the mechanisms of AS6 through transcriptome analyses. In particular, the cytotoxicity and global gene expression regulation by AS6 were compared in human normal and cancer breast epithelial cells. Using RNA-sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, differentially expressed genes in significantly affected biological pathways in these cell types were validated by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting assays. Our data show markedly differential effects of AS6 on cytotoxicity and gene expression in human mammary epithelial normal cells (HUMEC) and Michigan Cancer Foundation 7 (MCF7), a human mammary epithelial cancer cell line. AS6 selectively arrests cell growth and induces cell death in MCF7 cells without affecting the growth of HUMEC in a dose-dependent manner. AS6 alters the transcription of a large number of genes in MCF7 cells, but much fewer genes in HUMEC. Importantly, we found that the cell proliferation, cell cycle, and DNA repair pathways are significantly suppressed whereas cellular stress response and apoptotic pathways increase in AS6-treated MCF7 cells. Together, we provide the first evidence of differential effects of AS6 on normal and cancerous breast epithelial cells, suggesting that AS6 at moderate concentrations induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis through modulating genome-wide gene expression, leading to compromised DNA repair and increased genome instability selectively in human breast cancer cells.",

    "abstract": "Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of human tumors and normal cells exposed to various carcinogens has revealed distinct mutational patterns that provide deep insights into the DNA damage and repair processes. Although ionizing radiation (IR) is conventionally known as a strong carcinogen, its genome-wide mutational impacts have not been comprehensively investigated at the single-nucleotide level. Here, we explored the mutational landscape of normal single-cells after exposure to the various levels of IR. On average, 1 Gy of IR exposure generated [~]16 mutational events with a spectrum consisting of predominantly small nucleotide deletions and a few characteristic structural variations. In [~]30% of the post-irradiated cells, complex genomic rearrangements, such as chromoplexy, chromothripsis, and breakage-fusion-bridge cycles, were resulted, indicating the stochastic and chaotic nature of DNA repair in the presence of the massive number of concurrent DNA double-strand breaks. These mutational signatures were confirmed in the genomes of 22 IR-induced secondary malignancies. With high-resolution genomic snapshots of irradiated cells, our findings provide deep insights into how IR-induced DNA damage and subsequent repair processes operate in mammalian cells.",

    "abstract": "1Although initially showing great potential, oxytocin treatment has encountered a translational hurdle in its promise of treating the social deficits of autism. Some debate surrounds the ability of oxytocin to successfully enter the brain, and therefore modify neuroanatomy. Moreover, given the heterogeneous nature of autism, treatment will only amerliorate symptoms in a subset of patients. Therefore, to determine whether oxytocin changes brain circuitry, and whether it does so variably, depending on genotype, we implemented a large randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, preclinical study on chronic intranasal oxytocin treatment in three different mouse models related to autism with a focus on using neuroanatomical phenotypes to assess and subset treatment response. Intranasal oxytocin (0.6IU) was administered daily, for 28 days, starting at 5 weeks of age to the 16p11.2 deletion, Shank3 (exon 4-9) knockout, and Fmr1 knockout mouse models. Given the sensitivity of structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to the neurological effects of interventions like drugs, along with many other advantages, the mice underwent in vivo longitudinal and high-resolution ex vivo imaging with MRI. The scans included three in vivo T1-weighted, 90um isotropic resolution scans and a T2-weighted, 3D fast spin echo with 40um isotropic resolution ex vivo scan to assess the changes in neuroanatomy using established automated image registration and deformation based morphometry approaches in response to oxytocin treatment. The behavior of the mice was assessed in multiple domains, including social behaviours and repetitive behaviours, among others. Treatment effect on the neuroanatomy did not reach significance, although the pattern of trending effects was promising. No significant effect of treatment was found on social behavior in any of the strains, although a significant effect of treatment was found in the Fmr1 mouse, with treatment normalizing a grooming deficit. No other treatment effect on behavior was observed that survived multiple comparisons correction. Overall, chronic treatment with oxytocin had limited effects on the three mouse models related to autism, and no promising pattern of response susceptibility emerged.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryotic gene structure is a combination of exons generally interrupted by intragenic non-coding DNA regions termed introns removed by RNA splicing to generate the mature mRNA. Thus, eukaryotic genes can be either single exon genes (SEGs) or multiple exon genes (MEGs). Among SEGs, intronless genes (IGs) are a subgroup that additionally lacks introns at their UTRs, and code for proteins essentially involved in development, growth, and cell proliferation. Gene expression of IGs has been proposed to be highly specialized for neuro-specific functions and linked to cancer, neuropathies, and developmental disorders. The abundant presence of introns in eukaryotic genomes is pivotal for the precise control of gene expression. Notwithstanding, IGs exempting splicing events entail a higher transcriptional fidelity, making them even more valuable for regulatory roles. This work aimed to infer the functional role and evolutionary history of IGs using the mouse genome. Intronless protein-coding genes consist of a subgroup of ~6 % of a total of 21,527 genes with one exon. To understand the prevalence, biological relevance, and evolution, we identified and studied their 1,116 functional proteins. We validated differential expression in transcriptomics data of early embryo stages using mouse telencephalon tissue. Our results showed that expression levels of IGs are lower compared to MEGs. However, strongly upregulated IGs include transcription factors (TFs) such as the class 3 of POU (HMG Box), Neurog1, Olig1, and BHLHe22, BHLHe23, among other essential genes including the beta cluster of protocadherins. Most striking was the finding that IG-encoded BHLH TFs qualify the criteria to be referred to as microprotein candidates. Finally, predicted protein orthologs in other six genomes confirmed a high conservancy of IGs associated with regulating neurobiological processes and with chromatin organization and epigenetic regulation in Vertebrata. Moreover, this study highlights that IGs are essential modulators of regulatory processes, as Wnt signaling pathway and biological processes as pivotal as sensory organs developing at a transcriptional and post-translational level. Overall, our results suggest that IG proteins have specialized, prevalent, and unique biological roles and that functional divergence between IGs and MEGs is likely to be the result of specific evolutionary constraints.",

    "abstract": "Mutation-selection phylogenetic codon models are grounded on population genetics first principles and represent a principled approach for investigating the intricate interplay between mutation, selection and drift. In their current form, mutation-selection codon models are entirely characterized by the collection of site-specific amino-acid fitness profiles. However, thus far, they have relied on the assumption of a constant genetic drift, translating into a unique effective population size (Ne) across the phylogeny, clearly an unreasonable hypothesis. This assumption can be alleviated by introducing variation in Ne between lineages. In addition to Ne, the mutation rate () is susceptible to vary between lineages, and both should co-vary with life-history traits (LHTs). This suggests that the model should more globally account for the joint evolutionary process followed by all of these lineage-specific variables (Ne, , and LHTs). In this direction, we introduce an extended mutation-selection model jointly reconstructing in a Bayesian Monte Carlo framework the fitness landscape across sites and long-term trends in Ne,  and LHTs along the phylogeny, from an alignment of DNA coding sequences and a matrix of observed LHTs in extant species. The model was tested against simulated data and applied to empirical data in mammals, isopods and primates. The reconstructed history of Ne in these groups appears to correlate with LHTs or ecological variables in a way that suggests that the reconstruction is reasonable, at least in its global trends. On the other hand, the range of variation in Ne inferred across species is surprisingly narrow. This last point suggests that some of the assumptions of the model, in particular concerning the assumed absence of epistatic interactions between sites, are potentially problematic.",

    "abstract": "Floating toe (FT) is a frequently seen condition in which a toe is inadequately in contact with the ground. Although toes play an important role in stabilizing standing posture and walking, many aspects of the effects of FT on the body remain unclear. To our knowledge, there have been no reports about the relationship between FT and postural stability, especially in children. This study aimed to clarify the prevalence of FT and its relationship with static postural stability in children. Of the 400 children aged 8 years who participated in our cohort study, 396, who were examined for static postural stability, were included in this study. Postural stability and FT were assessed using a foot pressure plate. The sway path length of the center of pressure and the area of the ellipse defined as the size of the area marked by the center of pressure were measured as an evaluation of static postural stability. We calculated the \"floating toe score (FT score: small FT score indicates insufficient ground contact of the toes)\" using the image of the plantar footprint obtained at the postural stability measurement. The FT rate was very high at more than 90%, and the FT score in the eyes-closed condition was significantly higher than that in the eyes-open condition in both sexes. The FT score significantly correlated with the center of pressure path and area. Our results suggest that ground contact of the toes is not directly related to static postural stability in children, but it may function to stabilize the body when the condition becomes unstable, such as when the eyes are closed.",

We found that olfactory sensory neuron activity directly after hatching both directs and refines OR expression. We demonstrate that, as in mice, dLsd1 and Su(var)3-9 balance heterochromatin formation to direct OR expression. Neuronal activity induces dLsd1 and Su(var)3-9 expression, linking neuronal activity to OR expression. OR expression refinement shows a restricted duration, suggesting a gene regulatory critical period brings olfactory sensory neuron differentiation to an end. Consistent with a change in differentiation, stress during the critical period represses dLsd1 and Su(var)3-9 expression and makes the early permissive OR expression permanent. This induced permissive gene regulatory state makes OR expression resilient to stress later in life. Hence, during a critical period, OR activity feedback similar to in mouse OR selection, defines adult OR expression in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Pseudocercospora angolensis is the causative agent of Pseudocercospora leaf and fruit spot disease in citrus which can result in up to 100% yield loss. Early diagnosis of this disease is vital for effective control. This study aimed at developing a loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) system for detecting P. angolensis in sweet oranges in comparison with Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and using microscopy as a gold standard. Twelve non-target species were used to assess the analytical specificity of LAMP and PCR whereas the analytical sensitivity was determined using serial dilutions of P. angolensis DNA. The diagnostic accuracies of the two assays were evaluated using DNA from 150 diseased and 50 non-diseased sweet orange leaf samples. The analytical sensitivity and detection time of LAMP were of 10-4 ng/ l and 40 minutes, respectively. The analytical sensitivity of PCR was 10ng/l and it was specific to P. angolensis whereas three relatives of P. angolensis were detectable by LAMP. The diagnostic sensitivities of LAMP (93%) and microscopy (100%) were significantly different (X2 = 8.38, P = 0.0038) unlike the diagnostic specificities (90%) and (100%), respectively (X2 = 3.37, P = 0.066). Microscopy was significantly more sensitive than PCR (32.6%) (X2 = 149.26, P < 2.2e-16) and equally specific as PCR (P=NA). The positive predictive values of PCR and LAMP were 100% and 96.5% respectively whereas the negative predictive values were 33.1% and 81.8% respectively. The LAMP assay developed in this study offers a great tool for routine screening sweet orange samples for P. angolensis.",

    "abstract": "In depositional intertidal coastal systems, primary production is dominated by benthic microalgae (microphytobenthos) inhabiting the mudflats. This benthic productivity is supporting secondary production and supplying important services to humans including food provisioning. Increased frequencies of extreme events in weather (such as heatwaves, storm surges and cloudbursts) are expected to strongly impact the spatiotemporal dynamics of the microphytobenthos and subsequently their contribution to coastal food webs. Within north-western Europe, the years 2018 and 2019 were characterized by record-breaking summer temperatures and accompanying droughts. Field-calibrated satellite data (Sentinel 2) were used to quantify the seasonal dynamics of microphytobenthos biomass and production at an unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution during these years. We demonstrate that the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) should be used with caution in depositional coastal intertidal systems, because it may reflect import of remains of allochthonous pelagic productivity rather than local benthic biomass. We show that the reduction in summer biomass of the benthic microalgae cannot be explained by grazing but was most probably due to the high temperatures. The fivefold increase in salinity from January to September 2018, resulting from reduced river run-off during this exceptionally dry year, cannot have been without consequences for the vitality of the microphytobenthos community and its resistance to wind stress and cloud bursts. Comparison to historical information revealed that primary productivity of microphytobenthos may vary at least fivefold due to variations in environmental conditions. Therefore, ongoing changes in environmental conditions and especially extreme events because of climate change will not only lead to changes in spatiotemporal patterns of benthic primary production but also to changes in biodiversity of life under water and ecosystem services including food supply. Satellite MPB data allows for adequate choices in selecting coastal biodiversity conservation and coastal food supply.\n\nHIGHLIGHTSO_LIExpected seasonality changes require large-scale and high-resolution coastal data\nC_LIO_LINDVI of tidal flats reflects local benthic biomass and allochthonous phytoplankton\nC_LIO_LIHigh summer temperatures reduced biomass and productivity of benthic microalgae\nC_LIO_LILong-term data revealed a five-fold variation in MPB biomass and production\nC_LIO_LISatellite MPB data allow for adequate conservation of coastal biodiversity\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Accurate estimate of relatedness is important for genetic data analyses, such as association mapping and heritability estimation based on data collected from genome-wide association studies. Inaccurate relatedness estimates may lead to spurious associations and biased heritability estimations. Individual-level genotype data are often used to estimate kinship coefficient between individuals. The commonly used sample correlation-based genomic relationship matrix (scGRM) method estimates kinship coefficient by calculating the average sample correlation coefficient among all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), where the observed allele frequencies are used to calculate both the expectations and variances of genotypes. Although this method is widely used, a substantial proportion of estimated kinship coefficients are negative, which are difficult to interpret. In this paper, through mathematical derivation, we show that there indeed exists bias in the estimated kinship coefficient using the scGRM method when the observed allele frequencies are regarded as true frequencies. This leads to negative bias for the average estimate of kinship among all individuals, which explains the estimated negative kinship coefficients. Based on this observation, we propose an unbiased estimation method, UKin, which can reduce the bias. We justify our improved method with rigorous mathematical proof. We have conducted simulations as well as two real data analyses to demonstrate that both bias and root mean square error in kinship coefficient estimation can be reduced by using UKin. Further simulations indicate that the power in association mapping can also be improved by using our unbiased kinship estimates to adjust for cryptic relatedness.\n\nAuthor summaryInference of relatedness plays an important role in genetic data analysis. Many methods have been proposed to estimate kinship coefficients, including the commonly used genomic relationship matrix method. However, a substantial proportion of the kinship coefficients estimated by this method are negative, which is difficult to interpret. In this paper, through mathematical derivation, we show that there indeed exists a negative bias in this approach. To correct for this bias, we propose a new kinship coefficient estimation method, UKin, which is unbiased without requiring extra genetic information nor added computational complexity. The better performance of UKin in reducing bias and root mean squared error is demonstrated through theory, simulations and analysis of data from the young-onset breast cancer and familial intracranial aneurysm studies.",

Various urban eco-environmental problems have emerged in the world, among which the urban heat island effect has become one of the most obvious urban eco-environmental problems. In this study, Nanjing, China is chosen as the study area. Based on the Landsat8 remote sensing image data in Nanjing from 2014 to 2018, the land surface temperature is retrieved, the spatiotemporal variation track and characteristics of the thermal environment pattern are systematically depicted, and its driving factors are revealed. The results show that: in the past five years, the spatial pattern of heat field in Nanjing has changed from scattered distribution in the periphery of the city to centralized in the center of the city, and the heat island intensity has increased year by year. The changes of administrative divisions, the layout of transportation trunk lines, the transfer of industrial centers, and ecological construction projects are important driving factors for the evolution of land surface thermal environment pattern of these regions. The research results will provide scientific and technological support for similar cities with typical heat island effect in the world to make urban planning and development decisions, and to govern and improve urban ecological environment.",

Yet, their relationship and relative contribution in patient tumors remain poorly defined. Here, we demonstrate that the knock-out of GATA3, but not of PHOX2A or PHOX2B, in noradrenergic cells induces a mesenchymal phenotype. Our results document spontaneous plasticity in several models between both identities and show that plasticity relies on epigenetic reprogramming. We demonstrate that an in vivo microenvironment provides a powerful pressure towards a noradrenergic identity for these models. Consistently, tumor cells with a mesenchymal identity are not detected in a series of PDX models. Further study of the intra-tumor noradrenergic heterogeneity reveals two distinct cell populations exhibiting features of chromaffin-like or sympathoblast-like cells.

    "abstract": "ObjectiveAortic ruptures are fatal consequences of aortic aneurysms with macrophage accumulation being a hallmark at the site of ruptures. Pyroptosis is critical in macrophage-mediated inflammation. This study determined effects of pyroptosis on aortic dilation and rupture using GSDMD deficient mice.\n\nApproach and ResultsIn an initial study, male Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice in C57BL/6J background (8 - 10 weeks old) were infected with adeno-associated viral vectors encoding mouse PCSK9D377Y gain-of-function mutation and fed a Western diet to induce hypercholesterolemia. After two weeks of AAV infection, angiotensin II (AngII, 1 {micro}g/kg/min) was infused. During the 4 weeks of AngII infusion, 5 of 13 Gsdmd+/+ mice died of aortic rupture, whereas no aortic rupture occurred in Gsdmd-/- mice. In surviving mice, no differences in either ascending or abdominal aortic dilation were observed between Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice. To determine whether protection of GSDMD deficiency against aortic rupture is specific to AngII infusion, we subsequently examined aortic pathologies in mice administered beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). BAPN (0.5% wt/vol) was administered in drinking water to male Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice (4 weeks old) for 4 weeks. Six of 13 Gsdmd+/+ mice died of aortic rupture, whereas no aortic rupture occurred in Gsdmd-/- mice. In mice survived, no differences of diameters in the ascending, arch, or abdominal aortic regions were observed between Gsdmd+/+ and Gsdmd-/- mice.\n\nConclusionsGSDMD deficiency protects against AngII or BAPN-induced aortic ruptures in mice.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGSDMD deficiency protects against angiotensin II-induced aortic rupture in hypercholesterolemic mice.\nC_LIO_LIGSDMD deficiency protects against beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN)-induced aortic dissection and rupture in C57BL/6J mice.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Alpha-synuclein (aSyn) has implications in pathological protein aggregations observed in neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinsons and Alzheimers diseases. There are currently no approved prevention and cure for these diseases. In this context, matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) provide an opportunity because MMPs are broad-spectrum proteases and cleave aSyn. Previously, we showed that allosteric communications between the two domains of MMP1 on collagen fibril and fibrin depend on substrates, MMP1 activity, and ligands. However, allosteric communications in MMP1 on aSyn-induced aggregates have not been explored. Here we report quantification of allostery using single molecule measurements of MMP1 dynamics on aSyn-induced aggregates by calculating Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between two dyes attached to the catalytic and hemopexin domains of MMP1. The two domains of MMP1 prefer open conformations, with the two domains well-separated. These open conformations are inhibited by a single point mutation E219Q of MMP1 and tetracycline, an MMP inhibitor. A two-state Poisson process describes the interdomain dynamics. The best-fit parameters for a Gaussian fit to the distributions of FRET values provide the two states. The ratio of the kinetic rates between the two states comes from the ratio of fitted areas around the two states. The decay rate of an exponential fit to the correlations between FRET values provides the sum of the kinetic rates. Since a crystal structure of aSyn-bound MMP1 is not available, we performed molecular docking of MMP1 with aSyn using ClusPro. We simulated MMP1 dynamics using different docking poses and matched the experimental and simulated interdomain dynamics to determine the most appropriate pose. We performed virtual screening against the potential ligand-binding sites on the appropriate aSyn-MMP1 binding pose and showed that lead molecules differ between free MMP1 and substrate-bound MMP1. In other words, virtual screening needs to take substrates into account for substrate-specific control of MMP1 activity. Molecular understanding of interactions between MMP1 and aSyn-induced aggregates may open up the possibility of degrading pathological aggregates in neurodegeneration by targeting MMPs.\n\nSignificanceWe have quantified MMP1 interdomain dynamics on aSyn-induced aggregates by a two-state Poisson process. Histograms and correlations of FRET values determine the kinetic rates of interconversion between the two states. We quantify the conformational dynamics of the whole MMP1 and allosteric communications by the two-dimensional matrix of correlations between every pair of amino acids from experimentally-validated all-atom simulations. The two-dimensional correlations lead to a Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix and a measure of Shannon entropy describing the conformational fluctuations. As such, we address the quantification of allosteric communications, a leading challenge in defining allostery. We report that the potential ligand-binding sites and lead molecules change for MMP1 upon binding alpha-synuclein and depend on the binding pose selected. This suggests that one needs to take the substrate into account while targeting MMPs.",

Decomposition is a multi-trophic process involving multiple kingdoms of microbial life, but typically microbial ecology studies focus on one or two major lineages in isolation. We used Illumina shotgun RNA sequencing to conduct PCR-independent SSU rRNA community analysis (\"community RNA-Seq\") to simultaneously study the bacteria, archaea, fungi, and microfauna surrounding both living and decomposing roots of the annual grass, Avena fatua. Plants were grown in 13CO2-labeled microcosms amended with 15N-root litter. We identified rhizosphere substrate preferences for 13C-exudates versus 15N-litter using NanoSIMS microarray imaging (Chip-SIP). When litter was available, rhizosphere and bulk soil had significantly more Amoebozoa, which are potentially important yet often overlooked top-down drivers of detritusphere community dynamics and nutrient cycling. Bulk soil containing litter was depleted in Actinobacteria but had significantly more Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. While Actinobacteria were abundant in the rhizosphere, Chip-SIP showed Actinobacteria preferentially incorporated litter relative to root exudates, indicating this groups more prominent role in detritus elemental cycling in the rhizosphere. Our results emphasize that decomposition is a multi-trophic process involving cross-kingdom interactions, and the trajectory of carbon through this soil food web likely impacts the fate of carbon in soil.",

The goal of this study was to develop the first successful iron labeling method of breast cancer cells derived from patient brain metastases and validate this method with imaging during tumour development.\n\nLuciferase expressing human breast cancer PDX cells (F2-7) were successfully labeled after incubation with micron-sized iron oxide particles (MPIO; 25 g Fe/mL).

MPI revealed decreasing signal in the tumours and increasing signal in the liver region over time.\n\nHere, we demonstrate the first application of MPI to monitor the growth of a PDX MFP tumour. To accomplish this, we also demonstrate the first successful labeling of PDX cells with iron oxide particles.

    "abstract": "Temperature sensitivity--the magnitude of a biological response per {degrees}C--is a fundamental concept across scientific disciplines, especially biology, where temperature determines the rate of many plant, animal and ecosystem processes. Recently, a growing body of literature in global change biology has found temperature sensitivities decline as temperatures rise (Fuet al., 2015; Gusewell et al., 2017; Piao et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019; Dai et al., 2019). Such observations have been used to suggest climate change is reshaping biological processes, with major implications for forecasts of future change. Here we present a simple alternative explanation for observed declining sensitivities: the use of linear models to estimate non-linear temperature responses. We show how linear estimates of sensitivities will appear to decline with warming for events that occur after a cumulative thermal threshold is met--a common model for many biological events. Corrections for the non-linearity of temperature response in simulated data and long-term phenological data from Europe remove the apparent decline. Our results show that rising temperatures combined with linear estimates based on calendar time produce observations of declining sensitivity--without any shift in the underlying biology. Current methods may thus undermine efforts to identify when and how warming will reshape biological processes.\n\nSignificance statementRecently a growing body of literature has observed declining temperature sensitivities of plant leafout and other events with higher temperatures. Such results suggest that climate change is already reshaping fundamental biological processes. These temperature sensitivities are often estimated as the magnitude of a biological response per {degrees}C from linear regression. The underlying model for many events--that a critical threshold of warmth must be reached to trigger the event--however, is non-linear. We show that this mismatch between the statistical and biological models can produce the illusion of declining sensitivities with warming using current methods. We suggest simple alternative approaches that can better identify when and how warming will reshape biological processes.",

    "abstract": "Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) represent a sub-class among the large family of Cysteine-rich proteins (CRPs) specific to land plants. LTPs possess a hydrophobic cavity, enabling them to bind and stabilize a variety of lipid molecules outside membranes. In line with the existence of an N-terminal signal peptide, secreted LTPs represent a well-suited mobile signal carrier in the plants extracellular matrix. Thus, LTPs are currently considered as key players to mediate the bulk flow of lipids between membranes/compartments as well as the buildup of lipid barrier polymers including cutin and suberin.\n\nHere, we show that floral expressed Arabidopsis thaliana AtLtpI.4 (AtLTP2) and AtLtpI.8 (AtLTP5), mutually control cell-cell communication between growing pollen tubes and ovules during fertilization. Arabidopsis mutants lacking functional AtLtpI.4 and AtLtpI.8 exhibit significantly reduced fertilization success. Cross-pollination and cell biological analyses revealed that AtLtpI.4/I.8 double mutants are impaired in pollen tube guidance towards ovules. Our finding that the AtLtpI.4/I.8 phenotype correlates with aberrant callose depositions in the micropylar region during ovule development suggests that both LTPs represent novel players of a joint signaling pathway that controls callose homeostasis in the female gametophyte.",

    "abstract": "Molecular sequences are shaped by selection, where the strength of selection relative to drift is determined by effective population size (Ne). Populations with high Ne are expected to undergo stronger purifying selection, and consequently to show a lower substitution rate for selected mutations relative to the substitution rate for neutral mutations ({omega}). However, computational models based on biophysics of protein stability have suggested that{omega} can also be independent of Ne, a result proven under general conditions. Together, the response of{omega} to changes in Ne depends on the specific mapping from sequence to fitness. Importantly, an increase in protein expression level has been found empirically to result in decrease of{omega} , an observation predicted by theoretical models assuming selection for protein stability. Here, we derive a theoretical approximation for the response of{omega} to changes in Ne and expression level, under an explicit genotype-phenotype-fitness map. The method is generally valid for additive traits and log-concave fitness functions. We applied these results to protein undergoing selection for their conformational stability and corroborate out findings with simulations under more complex models. We predict a weak response of{omega} to changes in either Ne or expression level, which are interchangeable. Based on empirical data, we propose that fitness based on the conformational stability may not be a sufficient mechanism to explain the empirically observed variation in{omega} across species. Other aspects of protein biophysics might be explored, such as protein-protein interactions, which can lead to a stronger response of{omega} to changes in Ne.",

    "abstract": "SHARPIN (Src homology 3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein (SHANK)- associated RH domain-interacting protein) as part of the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) catalyses the addition of linear (Met1-linked) ubiquitin chains to substrates. As part of this complex SHARPIN acts as a multi-functional modulator of immune/inflammatory responses through regulation of NfkB activation. In addition, SHARPIN can act as a negative regulator of integrin function. Despite platelets being anucleate cells several studies have determined potential roles for both ubiquitination and NfkB in regulating platelet function. However, little is known about either linear ubiquitination and/or SHARPIN in mouse platelets. In this study, we evaluated platelet function in mice with impaired SHARPIN expression. We confirmed that SHARPIN was expressed in platelets from wild-type mice but not in mice homozygous for SHARPINcpdm allele (cpdm/cpdm) and that this correlated with a reduction in linear ubiquitination. Platelet function in response to thrombin was unaffected. In contrast, CRP-XL-and U46619-mediated platelet responses and thrombus formation under flow on a collagen-coated surface were significantly reduced in the cpdm/cpdm mice. This was associated with impaired U46619-mediated intracellular signalling as well as a reduction in CRP-mediated ERK phosphorylation. Despite the reported role for Nf{kappa}B in regulating platelet function, inhibiting I{kappa}B phosphorylation did not recapitulate the cpdm/cpdm phenotype. Together, these data indicate that the lack of SHARPIN and linear ubiquitination results in impaired thrombosis and platelet functional responses to CRP and U46619. This phenotype is independent of Nf{kappa}B pathway inhibition but may involve alternative signalling pathways regulated by linear ubiquitination.\n\nKey PointsO_LISHARPIN plays an essential role in platelet linear protein ubiquitination and CRP and U46619-mediated platelet function\nC_LIO_LIIn vitro thrombosis is significantly impaired in SHARPIN deficient mice\nC_LI",
