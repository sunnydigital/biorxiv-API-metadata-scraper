    "abstract": "2.Covariance between grey-matter measurements can reflect structural or functional brain networks though it has also been shown to be influenced by confounding factors (e.g. age, head size, scanner), which could lead to lower mapping precision (increased size of associated clusters) and create distal false positives associations in mass-univariate vertex-wise analyses. We evaluated this concern by performing state-of-the-art mass-univariate analyses (general linear model, GLM) on traits simulated from real vertex-wise grey matter data (including cortical and subcortical thickness and surface area). We contrasted the results with those from linear mixed models (LMMs), which have been shown to overcome similar issues in omics association studies. We showed that when performed on a large sample (N=8,662, UK Biobank), GLMs yielded large spatial clusters of significant vertices and greatly inflated false positive rate (Family Wise Error Rate: FWER=1, cluster false discovery rate: FDR>0.6). We showed that LMMs resulted in more parsimonious results: smaller clusters and reduced false positive rate (yet FWER>5% after Bonferroni correction) but at a cost of increased computation. In practice, the parsimony of LMMs results from controlling for the joint effect of all vertices, which prevents local and distal redundant associations from reaching significance. Next, we performed mass-univariate association analyses on five real UKB traits (age, sex, BMI, fluid intelligence and smoking status) and LMM yielded fewer and more localised associations. We identified 19 significant clusters displaying small associations with age, sex and BMI, which suggest a complex architecture of at least dozens of associated areas with those phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "Episodic learning and memory retrieval are critically dependent on a hippocampal 4-12 Hz oscillatory  clock signal, the theta oscillation. This clock is largely externally paced, by a network of GABAergic neurons in the medial septum (MS). Theoretical studies suggested a range of hypotheses how this network may achieve theta synchrony; however, experimental evidence is still lacking. By recording multiple single MS neurons and hippocampal local field potential oscillations simultaneously, with both acute and chronically implanted silicon probes, we show that MS pacemaker units oscillate at individual frequencies within the theta range in rodents. Synchronization of MS neuron frequencies, accompanied by an elevation of firing rates, was found to parallel hippocampal theta formation in multiple rodent model systems. This suggests a general mechanism for theta synchronization, akin to the synchronization of weakly coupled pendulum clocks observed by Huygens in the 17th century. We optogenetically identified the MS pacemaker units as parvalbumin-expressing GABAergic neurons, while the previously enigmatic MS glutamatergic neurons were mostly theta-activated non-rhythmic cells. Our data were consistent with a network model of partially connected single-compartment inhibitory pacemaker neurons, in which synchronization and de-synchronization in the frequency domain upon waxing and waning tonic excitatory drive was sufficient to toggle MS network output between theta and non-theta states. These results provide experimental and theoretical support to a frequency-synchronization mechanism for pacing hippocampal theta, which may serve as an inspirational prototype for the countless examples of synchronization processes in the central nervous system from Nematoda to Anthropoda to Chordate and Vertebrate phyla.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMany factors may affect wound healing in Diabetic foot ulcer, namely, microbial density, microorganisms, microbial synergy, the host immune response, and infected tissue quality.\n\nMethodologyThis study used a cross-sectional design. We assessed 38 Subjects with DFUs, 23 neuroischaimic, and 15 neuropathic, for microbiota colonizing the DFU utilizing traditional cultures and 16S gene sequencing methods. All the relevant clinical factors were collected. Wound swabs were collected for both traditional microbiological analysis, direct swab (DSM), and cultured (CM) microbiome analysis. DNA isolation, and 16SrRNA hypervariable regions were amplified. Bioinformatics analysis was performed using IonReporter Software, statistical analysis, and diversity indices were computed with vegan R-package.\n\nResultsThe traditional microbiological method was able to detect a maximum of one or two pathogens, and, in some cases, no pathogen was detected. The total number of the observed species was 176. The number of identified species was higher in the cultured microbiome (155) than the direct swab microbiome (136). Diversity analysis indicated that biological diversity is higher in the cultured microbiome compared with the DSM. The Shannon H index was 2.75 for the cultured microbiome and 2.63 for DSM. We observed some differences in the major bacterial taxa amongst neuroischaimic and neuropathic DFU microbiomes.\n\nConclusionsCultured microbiome is superior to both the traditional method and direct swab microbiome. The Neuroischaimic group showed higher values for the tested diversity indices than the Neuroischaimic group. Neither Cluster Analysis nor Principal Component Analysis showed apparent clustering amongst the two types of ulcers.",

Knockdown of PDGFR{beta} blocked JEV infection, and trans-complementation of PDGFR{beta} could partly restore its infectivity. The PDGFR{beta} inhibitor imatinib, which has been approved for the treatment of malignant metastatic cancer, protected mice against JEV-induced lethality by decreasing the viral load in the brain, while abrogating the histopathological changes associated with JEV infection. These findings demonstrated that PDGFR{beta} is important in viral infection and provided evidence for the potential to develop imatinib as a therapeutic intervention against JEV infection.",

    "abstract": "To identify novel host factors as putative targets to reverse HIV latency, we performed an insertional mutagenesis genetic screen in a latently HIV-1-infected pseudo-haploid KBM7 cell line (Hap-Lat). Following mutagenesis, insertions were mapped to the genome and bioinformatic analysis resulted in the identification of 69 candidate host genes involved in maintaining HIV-1 latency. A select set of candidate genes was functionally validated using shRNA mediated depletion in latent HIV-1 infected J-Lat A2 and 11.1 T cell lines. We confirmed ADK, CHD9, CMSS1, EVI2B, EXOSC8, FAM19A, GRIK5, IRF2BP2, NF1, and USP15 as novel host factors involved in the maintenance of HIV latency. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays indicated that CHD9, a Chromodomain Helicase DNA-binding protein, maintains HIV latency via direct association with the HIV 5LTR, and its depletion results in increased histone acetylation at the HIV-1 promoter, concomitant with HIV-1 latency reversal. FDA-approved inhibitors 5-Iodotubercidin, Trametinib, and Topiramate, targeting ADK, NF1, and GRIK5, respectively were characterized for their latency reversal potential. While 5-Iodotubercidin exhibited significant cytotoxicity in both J-Lat and primary CD4+ T cells, Trametinib reversed latency in J-Lat cells but not in latently HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells. Crucially, Topiramate reversed latency in cell-line models and latently infected primary CD4+ T cells, without inducing T cell activation or significant toxicity. Thus, using an adaptation of a haploid forward genetic screen, we identified novel and druggable host factors contributing to HIV-1 latency.\n\nImportanceA reservoir of latent HIV-1-infected cells persists in the presence of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), representing a major obstacle for viral eradication. Reactivation of the latent HIV-1 provirus is part of curative strategies which aim to promote clearance of the infected cells. Using a two-color haploid screen, we identified 69 candidate genes as latency maintaining host factors and functionally validated a subset of 10 of those in additional T-cell based cell line models of HIV-1 latency. We further demonstrated that CHD9 is associated with HIV-1s promoter, the 5LTR while this association is lost upon reactivation. Additionally, we characterized the latency reversal potential of FDA compounds targeting ADK, NF1, and GRIK5 and identify the GRIK5 inhibitor Topiramate as a viable latency reversal agent with clinical potential.",

Human septins in cells form hetero-octameric septin complexes containing the ubiquitously expressed SEPT9. Despite the established role of SEPT9 in mammalian development and human pathophysiology, biochemical and biophysical studies have relied on monomeric SEPT9 thus not recapitulating its native assembly into hetero-octameric complexes. We established a protocol that enabled the first-time isolation of recombinant human septin octamers containing distinct SEPT9 isoforms. A combination of biochemical and biophysical assays confirmed the octameric nature of the isolated complexes in solution. Reconstitution studies showed that octamers with either a long or a short SEPT9 isoform form filament assemblies, and can directly bind and cross-link actin filaments, raising the possibility that septin-decorated actin structures in cells reflect direct actin-septin interactions. Recombinant SEPT9-containing octamers will make it possible to design cell-free assays to dissect the complex interactions of septins with cell membranes and the actin/microtubule cytoskeleton.\n\nSummaryHuman septins in cells form hetero-octameric complexes containing the ubiquitously expressed SEPT9.

To discover therapeutic strategies reducing the spread of -synuclein aggregation, we performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen in a human cell-based model. We discovered that inhibiting PIKfyve dramatically reduced -synuclein aggregation induced with both recombinant -synuclein fibrils and fibrils isolated from MSA patient brain. While PIKfyve inhibition did not affect fibril uptake or -synuclein clearance or secretion, it reduced -synuclein trafficking from the early endosome to the lysosome, thereby limiting fibril escape from the lysosome and reducing the amount of fibrils that reach cytosolic -synuclein to induce aggregation.

The Drosophila ovary is a widely used model system to study the cellular activities underlying organ function, including stem cell regulation, cell signaling and epithelial morphogenesis. However, the relative paucity of cell type specific reagents hinders investigation of molecular functions at the appropriate cellular resolution.\n\nHere, we used single cell RNA sequencing to characterize all cell types of the stem cell compartment and early follicles of the Drosophila ovary. We computed transcriptional signatures and identified specific markers for nine states of germ cell differentiation, and 23 somatic cell types and subtypes. We uncovered an unanticipated diversity of escort cells, the somatic cells that directly interact with differentiating germline cysts. Three escort cell subtypes reside in discrete anatomical positions, and express distinct sets of secreted and transmembrane proteins, suggesting that diverse micro-environments support the progressive differentiation of germ cells. Finally, we identified 17 follicle cell subtypes, and characterized their transcriptional profiles. Altogether, we provide a comprehensive resource of gene expression, cell type specific markers, spatial coordinates and functional predictions for 34 ovarian cell types and subtypes.",

    "abstract": "Fire blight disease, caused by the bacterium Erwinia amylovora (E. amylovora), is responsible for substantial losses in cultivated apple worldwide. An important mechanism of plant immunity is based on the recognition of conserved microbial molecules, named pathogen- or microbe-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs), through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), leading to pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). The interspecies transfer of PRRs represents a promising strategy to engineer broad spectrum and durable disease resistance in crops. EFR, the Arabidopsis thaliana PRR for the PAMP elf18 derived from the elongation factor thermal unstable (EF-Tu) proved to be effective in improving bacterial resistance when expressed into Solanaceae and other plant species. In this study, we tested whether EFR can affect the interaction of apple with E. amylovora by its ectopic expression in the susceptible apple rootstock M.26. Stable EFR expression led to the activation of PAMP-triggered immune response in apple leaves upon treatment with supernatant of E. amylovora, as measured by production of reactive oxygen species and the induction of known defense genes. The amount of tissue necrosis associated with E. amylovora infection was significantly reduced in the EFR transgenic rootstock compared to the wild-type. Our results show that the expression of EFR in apple rootstock may be a valuable biotechnology strategy to improve the resistance of apple to fire blight.",

    "abstract": "Patients with pulmonary emphysema often develop locomotor muscle dysfunction, which is independently associated with disability and higher mortality in that population. Muscle dysfunction entails reduced force-generation capacity which partially depends on fibers oxidative potential, yet very little mechanistic research has focused on muscle respiration in pulmonary emphysema. Using a recently established animal model of pulmonary emphysema-driven skeletal muscle dysfunction, we found downregulation of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) subunit C in association with lower oxygen consumption and fatigue-tolerance in locomotor muscles. Reduced SDH activity has been previously observed in muscles from patients with pulmonary emphysema and we found that SDHC is required to support respiration in cultured muscle cells. Moreover, in-vivo gain of SDH function in emphysema animals muscles resulted in better oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and fatigue tolerance. These changes correlated with a larger number of relatively more oxidative type 2-A and 2X fibers, and a reduced amount of 2B fibers. Our data suggests that SDHC is a key regulator of respiration and fatigability in pulmonary emphysema-driven skeletal muscles, which could be impactful to develop strategies aimed at attenuating this comorbidity.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 Spike-specific antibodies contribute the majority of the neutralizing activity in most convalescent human sera. Two SARS-CoV-2 variants, N501Y.V1 (also known as B.1.1.7 lineage or VOC-202012/01) and N501Y.V2 (B.1.351 lineage), reported from the United Kingdom and South Africa, contain several mutations in the receptor binding domain of Spike and are of particular concern. To address the infectivity and neutralization escape phenotypes potentially caused by these mutations, we used SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus system to compare the viral infectivity, as well as the neutralization activities of convalescent sera and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Our results showed that N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 increase viral infectivity compared to the reference strain (wild-type, WT) in vitro. At 8 months after symptom onset, 17 serum samples of 20 participants (85%) retaining titers of ID50 >40 against WT pseudovirus, whereas the NAb titers of 8 samples (40%) and 18 samples (90%) decreased below the threshold against N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2, respectively. In addition, both N501Y Variant 1 and Variant 2 reduced neutralization sensitivity to most (6/8) mAbs tested, while N501Y.V2 even abrogated neutralizing activity of two mAbs. Taken together the results suggest that N501Y.V1 and N501Y.V2 reduce neutralization sensitivity to some convalescent sera and mAbs.",

While SHH tumors exhibit overall deregulation of this pathway, they also show patient age-specific aberrations.\n\nTo investigate if the developmental stage of the CGNP can account for these age-specific lesions, we analyzed developing murine CGNP transcriptomes and observed highly dynamic gene expression as function of age. Cross-species comparison with human SHH medulloblastoma showed partial maintenance of these expression patterns, and highlighted low primary cilium expression as hallmark of infant medulloblastoma and early embryonic CGNPs. This coincided with reduced responsiveness to upstream Shh pathway component Smoothened, while sensitivity to downstream components Sufu and Gli was retained.\n\nTogether, these findings can explain the preference for SUFU mutations in infant medulloblastoma and suggest that drugs targeting the downstream SHH pathway will be most appropriate for infant patients.",

To search for new anticoagulant rodenticide candidates we have computationally explored some of the rat genes previously implicated in resistance to actual anticoagulants. In particular, we searched among hundreds of anticoagulant-similar chemotypes those binding rat wild-type VKORC1 (the best-known anticoagulant target, a Vitamin K-recycling enzyme), VKORC1L1 (a VKORC1-related enzyme), Cytochrome P450 CYP enzymes (some of the most important enzymes implicated in detoxification) and anticoagulant-resistant VKORC1-mutants (to minimize propensity to resistance). Results predicted new VKORC1 leads with binding-scores in the low nM range (high binding-affinities) predicting hydroxycoumarin- and naphtoquinone-like chemotypes. We then selected top-leads with additional high binding-scores to more than three anticoagulant-related CYPs, suggesting minimal detoxification rates and therefore maximal anticoagulation expectatives. A downsized list of top top-leads maintaining VKORC1 low-binding scores to anticoagulant resistant mutants, was finally proposed for experimental validation. The combination of different rat targets for computational studies, could be used to search for unrelated chemotypes, for reduction of off-target environmental anticoagulant impacts, and/or as new tools to explore anticoagulant molecular mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Heart failure is often preceded by pathological cardiac hypertrophy, a thickening of the heart musculature driven by complex gene regulatory and signaling processes. The Drosophila heart has great potential as a genetic model for deciphering the underlying mechanisms of cardiac hypertrophy. However, current methods for evaluating hypertrophy of the Drosophila heart are laborious and difficult to carry out reproducibly. Here we demonstrate that micro-computerized tomography (microCT) is an accessible, highly reproducible method for non-destructive, quantitative analysis of Drosophila heart morphology and size. To validate our microCT approach for analyzing Drosophila cardiac hypertrophy, we show that expression of constitutively active Ras (Ras85DV12), previously shown to cause hypertrophy of the fly heart, results in significant thickening of both adult and larval heart walls when measured from microCT images. We then show using microCT analysis that genetic upregulation of store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) driven by expression of constitutively active Stim (StimCA) or Orai (OraiCA) proteins also results in significant hypertrophy of the Drosophila heart, through a process that specifically depends on Orai Ca2+ influx channels. Intravital imaging of heart contractility revealed significantly reduced end diastolic dimensions in StimCA and OraiCA expressing hearts, consistent with the hypertrophic phenotype. These results demonstrate that increased SOCE activity is an important driver of hypertrophic cardiomyocyte growth, and demonstrate how microCT analysis combined with tractable genetic tools in Drosophila can be used to delineate molecular signaling processes that underlie cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.\n\nNEW AND NOTEWORTHYGenetic analysis of cardiac hypertrophy in Drosophila holds immense potential for the discovery of new therapeutic targets to prevent and treat heart failure. However, this potential has been hindered by a lack of rapid and effective methods for analysis of heart size in flies. Here we demonstrate that analysis of the Drosophila heart with micro-computerized tomography yields accurate and highly reproducible heart size measurements that can be used to efficiently analyze heart growth and cardiac hypertrophy in Drosophila.",

A peculiarity of pyrimidine de novo synthesis in plants is the complex subcellular organization. Here, we studied two organellar localized enzymes in the pathway, with chloroplast aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATC), and mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH). ATC knockdowns were most severely affected, exhibiting low levels of pyrimidine nucleotides, a low energy state, reduced photosynthetic capacity and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, altered leaf morphology and chloroplast ultrastructure were observed in ATC mutants. Although less affected, DHODH knockdown mutants showed impaired seed germination and altered mitochondrial ultrastructure. Transcriptome analysis of an ATC-amiRNA line revealed massive alterations in gene expression with central metabolic pathways being downregulated and stress response and RNA related pathways being upregulated. In addition, genes involved in central carbon metabolism, intracellular transport and respiration were mainly downregulated in ATC mutants, being putatively responsible for the observed impaired growth.\n\nONE-SENTENCE SUMMARYImpaired pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis results in nucleotide limitation and imbalance, resulting in impaired photosynthesis, reduced growth, reproduction, and seed yield together with massively altered gene expression",

    "abstract": "Because somatosensory PNS neurons, in particular nociceptors, are specially tuned to be able to detect a wide variety of both exogenous and endogenous signals, it is widely assumed that these neurons express a greater variety of receptor genes. Because cells detect such signals via cell surface receptors, we sought to formally test the hypothesis that PNS neurons might express a broader array of cell surface receptors than CNS neurons using existing single cell RNA sequencing resources from mouse. We focused our analysis on ion channels, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRS), receptor tyrosine kinase and cytokine family receptors. In partial support of our hypothesis, we found that mouse PNS somatosensory, sympathetic and enteric neurons and CNS neurons have similar receptor expression diversity in families of receptors examined, with the exception of GPCRs and cytokine receptors which showed greater diversity in the PNS. Surprisingly, these differences were mostly driven by enteric and sympathetic neurons, not by somatosensory neurons or nociceptors. Secondary analysis revealed many receptors that are very specifically expressed in subsets of PNS neurons, including some that are unique among neurons for nociceptors. Finally, we sought to examine specific ligand-receptor interactions between T cells and PNS and CNS neurons. Again, we noted that most interactions between these cells are shared by CNS and PNS neurons despite the fact that T cells only enter the CNS under rare circumstances. Our findings demonstrate that both PNS and CNS neurons express an astonishing array of cell surface receptors and suggest that most neurons are tuned to receive signals from other cells types, in particular immune cells.",

The role of these meningeal B cells in disease is not known, nor is their susceptibility to anti-CD20 therapy. Here, we administered anti-CD20 to 2D2 IgHMOG spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis mice in the chronic phase of disease, after the establishment of meningeal B cell clusters. Compared to the circulation, lymph nodes, and spleen, B cell depletion from the CNS was delayed and not evident until 7d post administration of anti-CD20. Further, we did not find evidence that anti-CD20 accessed meningeal B cells directly, but rather that depletion was indirect and the result of ongoing turnover of the meningeal population and elimination of the peripheral pool from which it is sustained. The reduction of B cell numbers in the CNS coincided with less demyelination of the spinal cord white matter and also, surprisingly, an increase in the number of T cells recruited to the meninges but not parenchyma.",

    "abstract": "The conidia of a hemibiotrophic fungus Colletotrichum gloeosporioides can conventionally form germ tube (GT) and develop in to a fungal colony, while under certain conditions, they tend to get connected with each other through conidial anastomosis tube (CAT) so as to share the nutrients. CAT fusion is believed to be responsible for generation of genetic variations in few asexual fungi, which appears problematic for effective fungal disease management. The physiological and molecular mechanism underlying the GT versus CAT formation remained unexplored. In the present study, we have deciphered the decision switch responsible for GT formation versus CAT fusion in C. gloeosporioides. GT formation occurred at high frequency in the presence of nutrients, while CAT fusion was found to be higher in absence of nutrients. Younger conidia were found to form GT efficiently, whilst older conidia preferentially formed CAT. Whole transcriptome analysis of GT and CAT fusion revealed differential molecular requirements for these two processes. We identified 11050 and 9786 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GT and CAT, respectively. A total 1567 effector candidates were identified, of them 103 and 101 were uniquely secreted during GT and CAT formation respectively. Genes coding for cell wall degrading enzymes, germination, hyphal growth, host-fungus interaction and virulence were up-regulated during GT formation. Whilst, genes involved in stress response, cell wall remodelling, membrane transport, cytoskeleton, cell cycle, and cell rescue were highly up-regulated during CAT fusion. To conclude, the GT and CAT fusion were found to be mutually exclusive processes, requiring differential physiological conditions and sets of DEGs in C. gloeosporioides. This will help to understand the basic CAT biology in the genus Colletotrichum.",

MDR strains of S. Infantis and E. coli are frequently isolated from broiler chicks and the simultaneous presence of these two enteric bacterial species would potentially allow the exchange of mobile resistance determinants.\n\nObjectivesIn order to understand possible genomic relations and to obtain a first insight into the potential interplay of resistance genes between enteric bacteria, we compared genomic diversity and mobile resistomes of S. Infantis and E. coli from broiler sources.\n\nResultsThe cgMLST analysis of 56 S. Infantis and 90 E. coli contemporary strains revealed a high genomic heterogeneity of broiler E. coli. It also allowed the first insight into the genomic diversity of the MDR clone B2 of S. Infantis, which is endemic in Hungary. We also identified new MDR lineages for S. Infantis (ST7081 and ST7082) and for E. coli (ST8702 and ST10088). Comparative analysis of antibiotic resistance genes and plasmid types revealed a relatively narrow interface between the mobile resistomes of E. coli and S. Infantis. The mobile resistance genes tet(A), aadA1 and sul1 were identified at an overall high prevalence in both species. This gene association is characteristic to the plasmid pSI54/04 of the epidemic clone B2 of S. Infantis. Simultaneous presence of these genes and of IncI and IncX plasmids in cohabitant caecal strains of E. coli and S. Infantis suggests an important role of these plasmids in a possible interplay of resistance genes between S. Infantis and E. coli in broilers.\n\nConclusionsThis is the first comparative genomic analysis of contemporary broiler strains of S. Infantis and E. coli. The diversity of mobile resistomes suggests that commensal E. coli could be potential reservoirs of resistance for S. Infantis, but so far only a few plasmid types and mobile resistance genes could be considered as potentially exchangeable between these two species. Among these, IncI plasmids could make the greatest contribution to the microevolution and genetic interaction between E. coli and S. Infantis.",

Although the mouses cochlea is frequently studied the mouses inner ear continues to develop postnatally whilst the human inner ear is fully developed by the third month of gestation which leads one to question the applicability of findings based on research on mice to human regenerative therapies. Here, we report a novel in vitro culture of adult porcine (Sus scrofa) inner ear cells developed from post-mortem labyrinth specimens. Anatomical findings based on maximal transverse and vertical axial diameters and the length of the cochlear duct suggest that the pigs cochlea is similar to the human cochlea. In vitro cultures of porcine cochlear and vestibular cells showed the persistence of both inner ear hair cell (HC), supporting cell (SC) and stem/progenitor cell characteristics across passages up to 6 based on scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence immunocytochemistry and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Our findings showed that porcine cochlear and vestibular epithelia maintained multipotent stem/progenitor cell populations into adulthood although their regenerative capacities differed across the passages. The development of a viable and reproducible method to culture porcine inner ear cells provides an important investigative tool that can be utilized to study and evaluate the pathophysiological causes and cellular consequences of human inner ear disorders.",

Our results highlight the strong predictive power of this model: least-square regression between predicted and observed height of our validation dataset was very close to the 1:1 relation and strongly supported by validation metrics (R2 = 0.75; relative RMSE = 19%). Moreover, our findings indicated an ecological gradient responsible for differences in height growth at the landscape scale, with better growth rates on mesic slopes compared to badly drained soils on flat lands. With the increased availability of LiDAR data, this method is promising since it can be applied to forests across the globe that are affected by stand-replacing disturbances.",

It has an elongate uniramous antennule and a short uniramous second appendage, followed by ten homonomous biramous appendages, each comprising a short paddle-shaped exopod and a unique feather-like endopod with at least 27 podomeres each of which bears a long blade-like endite with a short terminal seta. Based on its carapace and previously known soft-part anatomy C. ovata was compared with the Burgess Shale mandibulate euarthropod Waptia. However, Waptia has recently been shown to bear specialized head appendages that are interpreted as a mandible and maxillula, posterior to which are four appendages each with five-segmented endopods. In contrast, we interpret Chuandianella as an  upper stem-group euarthropod that possessed neither a differentiated mandible nor a maxillula. Chuandianella further demonstrates that early Cambrian  upper stem-group euarthropods were experimenting with a range of different limb arrangements and morphologies.",

    "abstract": "Mutualistic interactions between defended species represent a striking case of evolutionary convergence in sympatry, driven by the increased protection against predators brought by mimicry in warning traits. However, such convergence is often limited: sympatric defended species frequently display different or imperfectly similar warning traits. The phylogenetic distance between sympatric species may indeed prevent evolution towards the exact same signal. Moreover, warning traits are also involved in mate recognition, so that trait convergence might result in heterospecific courtship and mating. Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the strength and direction of evolution of warning trait in defended species with different ancestral traits. Specifically, we determine the effect of phenotypic distances between ancestral trait states of sympatric defended species and of costs of heterospecific sexual interactions on imperfect mimicry and trait divergence. Our analytical results confirm that reproductive interference and historical constraints limit the convergence of warning traits, leading to either complete divergence, or imperfect mimicry. Our model reveals that imperfect mimicry evolves only when ancestral trait values differ between species due to historical constraints and highlights the importance of female and predator discriminations in the evolution of such imperfect mimicry. Our study thus provides new predictions on how reproductive interference interacts with historical constraints and may promote the emergence of novel warning traits, enhancing mimetic diversity.",

    "abstract": "The lack of an identifiable intermediate host species for the proximal animal ancestor of SARS-CoV-2, and the large geographical distance between Wuhan and where the closest evolutionary related coronaviruses circulating in horseshoe bats (Sarbecoviruses) have been identified, is fuelling speculation on the natural origins of SARS-CoV-2. We have comprehensively analysed phylogenetic relations between SARS-CoV-2, and the related bat and pangolin Sarbecoviruses sampled so far. Determining the likely recombination events reveals a highly reticulate evolutionary history within this group of coronaviruses. Clustering of the inferred recombination events is non-random with evidence that Spike, the main target for humoral immunity, is beside a recombination hotspot likely driving antigenic shift in the ancestry of bat Sarbecoviruses. Coupled with the geographic ranges of their hosts and the sampling locations, across southern China, and into Southeast Asia, we confirm horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus, are the likely SARS-CoV-2 progenitor reservoir species. By tracing the recombinant sequence patterns, we conclude that there has been relatively recent geographic movement and co-circulation of these viruses ancestors, extending across their bat host ranges in China and Southeast Asia over the last 100 years or so. We confirm that a direct proximal ancestor to SARS-CoV-2 is yet to be sampled, since the closest relative shared a common ancestor with SARS-CoV-2 approximately 40 years ago. Our analysis highlights the need for more wildlife sampling to (i) pinpoint the exact origins of SARS-CoV-2s animal progenitor, and (ii) survey the extent of the diversity in the related Sarbecoviruses phylogeny that present high risk for future spillover.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe origin of SARS-CoV-2 can be traced to horseshoe bats, genus Rhinolophus, with ranges in both China and Southeast Asia.\nC_LIO_LIThe closest known relatives of SARS-CoV-2 exhibit frequent transmission among their Rhinolophus host species.\nC_LIO_LISarbecoviruses have undergone extensive recombination throughout their evolutionary history.\nC_LIO_LIAccounting for the mosaic patterns of these recombinants is important when inferring relatedness to SARS-CoV-2.\nC_LIO_LIBreakpoint patterns are consistent with recombination hotspots in the coronavirus genome, particularly upstream of the pike open reading frame with a coldspot in S1.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "RNA sequencing enables high-contents/high-complexity measurements in small molecule screens performed on biological samples. Whereas the costs of DNA sequencing and the complexity of RNA-seq library preparation and analysis have decreased consistently, RNA extraction remains a significant bottleneck for RNA-seq of hundreds of samples in parallel. Direct use of cell lysate for RNA-seq library prep is common in single cell RNA-seq but not in bulk RNA-seq protocols. Recently published protocols suggest that direct lysis is compatible with simplified RNA-seq library prep. Here, we evaluate the performance of a bulk RNA-seq library prep protocol optimized for analysis of many samples of adherent cultured cells in parallel. We combine a low-cost direct lysis buffer compatible with cDNA synthesis (\"in-lysate cDNA synthesis\") with Smart-3SEQ and examine the effects of calmidazolium and fludrocortisone-induced perturbation of primary human dermal fibroblasts. We compared this method to normalized purified RNA inputs from matching samples followed by Smart-3SEQ or Illumina TruSeq library prep. Our results show that whereas variable RNA inputs for each sample in the in-lysate cDNA synthesis protocol result in variable sequencing depth, this had minimal effect on data quality, measurement of gene expression patterns, or generation of differentially expressed gene lists. We found that in-lysate cDNA synthesis combined with Smart-3SEQ RNA-seq library prep allows generation of high-quality data when compared to library prep with extracted RNA, or when compared to Illumina TruSeq.

    "abstract": "The Botryosphaeriaceae are important plant pathogens, but unique in their ability to establish asymptomatic infections that persist for extended periods in a latent state. In this study, we used comparative analyses to consider elements that might shed light on the genetic basis of the interactions of these fungi with their plant hosts. For this purpose, we characterised secreted hydrolytic enzymes, secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters and considered general trends in genomic architecture using all available Botryosphaeriaceae genomes, and selected Dothideomycetes genomes. The Botryosphaeriaceae genomes were rich in carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), proteases, lipases and secondary metabolic biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) compared to other Dothideomycete genomes. The genomes of Botryosphaeria, Macrophomina, Lasiodiplodia and Neofusicoccum, in particular, had gene expansions of the major constituents of the secretome, notably CAZymes involved in plant cell wall degradation. The Botryosphaeriaceae genomes were shown to have moderate to high GC contents and most had low levels of repetitive DNA. The genomes were not compartmentalized based on gene and repeat densities, but genes of secreted enzymes were slightly more abundant in gene-sparse regions. The abundance of secreted hydrolytic enzymes and secondary metabolite BGCs in the genomes of Botryosphaeria, Macrophomina, Lasiodiplodia, and Neofusicoccum were similar to those in necrotrophic plant pathogens, but also endophytes of woody plants. The results provide a foundation for future comparative genomic analyses and hypothesis to explore the mechanisms underlying Botryosphaeriaceae host-plant interactions.",

    "abstract": "Cognitive resilience is the ability to withstand the negative effects of stress on cognitive functioning and is important for maintaining quality of life while aging. UK Biobank (UKB) does not have direct measurements of the same cognitive phenotype at distal timepoints. Therefore, we used number of education years (EY) as a proxy phenotype for past cognitive performance. Current cognitive performance was determined based on processing speed. This approach captured an average time span of 40 years between past and current cognitive performance in 330,097 individuals. A confounding factor was that EY is highly polygenic and masked the genetics of resilience. To overcome this, we employed Genomics Structural Equation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to perform a GWAS-by-subtraction using two GWAS, one GWAS of EY and resilience and a second GWAS of EY but not resilience. Subtracting one from the other generated a GWAS of Resilience. Replication of this approach was shown using independent discovery and replication samples within UKB and the full UKB GWAS results show significant genetic correlation with a GWAS of cognitive change in the independent Health and Retirement Study (N=9,526; P=1.5x10-3). We found 13 independent genetic loci for Resilience. Functional analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of specific cell types, including GABAergic neurons (P=6.59x10-8) and glutamatergic neurons (P=6.98x10-6) in the cortex. Gene-set analyses implicated the biological process \"neuron differentiation\" (P=9.7x10-7) and the cellular component \"synaptic part\" (P=2.14x10-6). Mendelian randomization analysis showed a causative effect of white matter volume on cognitive resilience. These results enhance neurobiological understanding of resilience.",

    "abstract": "Cell motility in response to environmental cues forms the basis of many developmental processes in multicellular organisms. One such environmental cue is an electric field (EF), which induces a form of motility known as electrotaxis. Electrotaxis has evolved in a number of cell types to guide wound healing, and has been associated with different cellular processes, suggesting that observed electrotactic behaviour is likely a combination of multiple distinct effects arising from the presence of an EF. In order to determine the different mechanisms by which observed electrotactic behaviour emerges, and thus to design EFs that can be applied to direct and control electrotaxis, researchers require accurate quantitative predictions of cellular responses to externally-applied fields. Here, we use mathematical modelling to formulate and parametrise a variety of hypothetical descriptions of how cell motility may change in response to an EF. We calibrate our model to observed data using synthetic likelihoods and Bayesian sequential learning techniques, and demonstrate that EFs bias cellular motility through only one of a selection of hypothetical mechanisms. We also demonstrate how the model allows us to make predictions about cellular motility under different EFs. The resulting model and calibration methodology will thus form the basis for future data-driven and model-based feedback control strategies based on electric actuation.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEElectrotaxis is attracting much interest and development as a technique to control cell migration due to the precision of electric fields as actuation signals. However, precise control of electrotactic migration relies on an accurate model of how cell motility changes in response to applied electric fields. We present and calibrate a parametrised stochastic model that accurately replicates experimental single-cell data and enables the prediction of input-output behaviour while quantifying uncertainty and stochasticity. The model allows us to elucidate and quantify how electric fields perturb the motile behaviour of the cell. This model and the associated simulation-based calibration methodology will be central to future developments in the control of electrotaxis.",

    "abstract": "MYCN is an oncogenic driver in neural crest-derived neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. To better understand the early effects of MYCN activation in a neural-crest lineage context, we profiled the transcriptome of immortalized human retina pigment epithelial cells with inducible MYCN activation. Gene signatures associated with elevated MYC/MYCN activity were induced after 24 h of MYCN activation, which attenuated but sustained at later time points. Unexpectedly, MYCN activation was accompanied by reduced cell growth. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed a senescence-like signature with strong induction of p53 and p21 but in the absence of canonical hallmarks of senescence such as beta-galactosidase positivity, suggesting incomplete cell fate commitment. When scrutinizing the putative drivers of this growth attenuation, differential gene expression analysis identified several regulators of nucleolar stress. This process was also reflected by phenotypic correlates such as cytoplasmic granule accrual and nucleolar coalescence. Hence, we propose that the induction of MYCN congests the translational machinery, causing nucleolar stress and driving cells into a transient pre-senescent state. Our findings shed new light on the early events induced by MYCN activation and may help unravelling which factors are required for cells to tolerate unscheduled MYCN overexpression during early malignant transformation.\n\nHighlightsO_LIActivation of MYCN attenuates proliferation in RPE1 cells\nC_LIO_LIGrowth arrest is associated with an early senescence-like transcriptional signature\nC_LIO_LITranscriptional and phenotypic evidence of nucleolar stress\nC_LIO_LICDKN1A upregulation in G2 phase primes cells for faltering in subsequent G1\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "The virulence of Bacillus anthracis is linked to the secretion of anthrax lethal toxin and anthrax edema toxin. These binary toxins consist of a common cell-binding moiety, protective antigen (PA), and the enzymatic moieties, lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF). PA binds either of two specific cell surface receptors, capillary morphogenesis protein-2 (CMG-2) or tumor endothelial marker-8 (TEM-8), which triggers the binding, endocytosis, and cytoplasmic translocation of LF and EF. The cellular distribution of functional TEM-8 and CMG-2 receptors during anthrax toxin intoxication in animals is not fully elucidated. Herein, we describe a novel assay to image anthrax toxin intoxication in live animals, and we use the assay to visualize TEM-8- and CMG-2-dependent intoxication. Specifically, we generated a chimeric protein consisting of the N-terminal domain of LF fused to a nuclear localization signal-tagged Cre recombinase (LFn-NLS-Cre). When PA and LFn-NLS-Cre were co-administered to transgenic mice that ubiquitously express a red fluorescent protein in the absence of Cre activity and a green fluorescent protein in the presence of Cre activity, anthrax toxin intoxication could be visualized at single-cell resolution by confocal microscopy. By using this assay, we show that CMG-2 is critical for intoxication in the liver and heart, whereas TEM-8 is required for full intoxication in the kidney and spleen. Other tissues examined were largely unaffected by single deficiences in either receptor, suggesting extensive overlap in TEM-8 and CMG-2 expression. The novel assay will be useful for basic and clinical/translational studies of Bacillus anthracis infection and for identifying on- and off-targets for reengineered toxin variants in the clinical development of cancer treatments.\n\nBackgroundAssays for imaging of anthrax toxin intoxication in animals are not available.\n\nResultsAnthrax toxin-Cre fusions combined with fluorescent Cre reporter mice enabled imaging of anthrax toxin intoxication in animals.\n\nConclusionShared and distinct functions of toxin receptors in cellular entry were uncovered.

    "abstract": "Bacterial galactosemia or \"galactose death,\" triggered by incomplete galactose metabolism, was first discovered in Escherichia coli and Salmonella six decades ago, and later in many other microorganisms, yet the mechanism for the toxicity and subsequent cell death remains unclear. In Bacillus subtilis, galactosemia is manifested by a buildup of uridine-diphosphate-galactose (UDP-Gal) and a strong toxicity phenotype characterized by cell shape abnormality and rapid cell lysis. Here we present evidence that in B. subtilis, the toxicity is due to inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis through interference of the essential glycosyltransferase MurG that carries out lipid II synthesis from lipid I and uridine-diphosphate-N-acetyl-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). Single-molecule imaging reveals real-time inhibition of cell wall biosynthesis and MurG activities in cells exhibiting toxicity. We further show that in vitro, MurG is able to utilize UDP-Gal as a substrate generating a \"toxic\" lipid II, causing a potential poisoning effect on peptidoglycan crosslinking. Evidence also suggests a similar mechanism in Vibrio cholerae and Staphylococcus aureus. Lastly, a strong synergistic lethality was seen in S. aureus wild-type cells treated with both galactose and sub-lethal doses of cell-wall antibiotics. Our study provides mechanistic explanation of the toxicity associated with bacterial galactosemia and its potential application in antibacterial solutions.\n\nSignificanceGalactosemia is a potentially fatal genetic disorder due to incomplete galactose metabolism, found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms. The molecular mechanisms of galactosemia-associated toxicity remain unclear in all cases. Here we present evidence that in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the toxicity is due to interference of an essential glycosyltransferase, MurG, which concerts lipid I to lipid II during peptidoglycan biosynthesis, by a nucleotide sugar derived from galactose metabolism. This interference leads to a halt of cell wall biosynthesis and structural defects causing rapid cell lysis. Our evidence also suggests a similar mechanism in other bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio cholerae. Our study may help solve the long-time puzzle of bacterial galactosemia first uncovered six decades ago.",

    "abstract": "Increasing interest has emerged in new mathematical approaches that simplify the study of complex differentiation processes by formalizing Waddingtons landscape metaphor. However, a rational method to build these landscape models remains an open problem. Building on pioneering work by Corson and Siggia (2012, 2017) we study vulval development in C. elegans by developing a framework based on Catastrophe Theory (CT) and approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to build data-fitted landscape models. We first identify the candidate qualitative landscapes, and then use CT to build the simplest model consistent with the data, which we quantitatively fit using ABC. The resulting model suggests that the underlying mechanism is a quantifiable two-step decision controlled by EGF and Notch-Delta signals, where a non-vulval/vulval decision is followed by a bistable transition to the two vulval states. This new model fits a broad set of data and makes several novel predictions.",

    "abstract": "Advances in genome sequencing technologies and lower costs have enabled the exploration of a multitude of known and novel environments and microbiomes. This has led to an exponential growth in the raw sequence data that is deposited in online repositories. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data sets are typically analysed with regards to a specific biological question. However, it is widely acknowledged that these data sets are comprised of a proportion of sequences that bear no similarity to any currently known biological sequence, and this so-called  dark matter is often excluded from downstream analyses. In this study, a systematic framework was developed to assemble, identify, and measure the proportion of unknown sequences present in distinct human microbiomes. This framework was applied to forty distinct studies, comprising 963 samples, and covering ten different human microbiomes including fecal, oral, lung, skin and circulatory system microbiomes. The framework was used to determine the proportion of taxonomically unknown sequences present within samples, and to compare such sequences both within and across assembled metagenomes. We found that whilst the human microbiome is one of the most extensively studied, on average 2% of assembled sequences have not yet been taxonomically defined. However, this proportion varied extensively among different microbiomes and was as high as 25% for skin and oral microbiomes that have more interactions with the environment. The publicly available data sets used have not previously been systematically mined to quantify and compare such dark matter. Typically, these unknown sequences are found in several microbiomes and potentially belong to unidentified novel microbes that we interact with on a daily basis. A cross-study comparison led to the identification of similar unknown sequences in different samples and/or microbiomes. A rate of taxonomic characterisation of 1.64% of unknown sequences being characterised per month was calculated from these taxonomically unknown sequences discovered in this study. Additionally, the approach led to the discovery of several potentially novel viral genomes that bear no similarity to sequences in the public databases. Both our computational framework and the novel unknown sequences produced are publicly available for future cross-referencing.",

    "abstract": "Endosymbiosis was fundamental for the evolution of eukaryotic complexity. Endosymbiotic interactions can be dissected through forward and reverse-genetic experiments, such as RNA-interference (RNAi). However, distinguishing small (s)RNA pathways in a eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiotic interaction is challenging. Here, we investigate the repertoire of RNAi pathway protein-encoding genes in the model nascent endosymbiotic system, Paramecium bursaria-Chlorella spp. Using comparative genomics and transcriptomics supported by phylogentics, we identify essential proteome components of the small interfering (si)RNA, scan (scn)RNA, and internal eliminated sequence (ies)RNA pathways. Our analyses reveal that copies of these components have been retained throughout successive whole genome duplication (WGD) events in the Paramecium clade. We then validate feeding-induced siRNA-based RNAi in P. bursaria via knock-down of the splicing factor, u2af1, which we show to be crucial to host growth. Finally, using simultaneous knock-down paradox controls to rescue the effect u2af1 knock-down, we demonstrate that feeding-induced RNAi in P. bursaria is dependent upon a core pathway of host-encoded Dcr1, Piwi and Pds1 components. Our experiments confirm the presence of a functional, host-derived RNAi pathway in P. bursaria that generates 23-nt siRNA, validating use of the P. bursaria-Chlorella spp. system to investigate the genetic basis of a nascent endosymbiosis.",

In the present investigation, activation tagged (AT) lines of rice endowed with improved agronomic attributes have been analyzed for tolerance to salinity stress besides identification of genes associated with these attributes. Under salinity stress conditions, AT lines exhibited increased seed germination rates, improved plant growth and development at vegetative and reproductive stages as compared to wild-type (WT) plants. Furthermore, AT lines disclosed enhanced plant water content, photosynthetic efficiency, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency and maximum quantum yield when compared to WT plants, leading to improved yields and delayed onset of stress symptoms. Moreover, AT lines revealed effective antioxidant systems causing decreased accumulation of reactive oxygen species and delayed salinity stress symptoms compared to WT plants. Reduced accumulation of malondialdehyde with concomitant increases in proline and soluble sugars of AT lines further endorsing their improved stress tolerance levels. TAIL and qRT-PCR analyses of AT lines revealed Ds element integrations at different loci and respective overexpression of identified candidate genes involved in various aspects of plant development and stress tolerance. Accordingly, the AT lines plausibly serve as a rare genetic resource for fortifying stress tolerance and productivity traits of elite rice cultivars.\n\nHighlightActivation tagged lines of rice endowed with improved agronomic attributes have been analyzed for tolerance to salinity stress besides identification and expression analysis of genes associated with these attributes.",

    "abstract": "Most age-related human diseases are accompanied by a decline in cellular organelle integrity, including impaired lysosomal proteostasis and defective mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. An open question, however, is the degree to which inherited variation in or near genes encoding each organelle contributes to age-related disease pathogenesis. Here, we evaluate if genetic loci encoding organelle proteomes confer greater-than-expected age-related disease risk. As mitochondrial dysfunction is a \"hallmark\" of aging, we begin by assessing nuclear and mitochondrial DNA loci near genes encoding the mitochondrial proteome and surprisingly observe a lack of enrichment across 24 age-related traits. Within nine other organelles, we find no enrichment with one exception: the nucleus, where enrichment emanates from nuclear transcription factors. In agreement, we find that genes encoding several organelles tend to be \"haplosufficient,\" while we observe strong purifying selection against heterozygous protein-truncating variants impacting the nucleus. Our work identifies common variation near transcription factors as having outsize influence on age-related trait risk, motivating future efforts to determine if and how this inherited variation then contributes to observed age-related organelle deterioration.",

    "abstract": "Frogs dependent on lotic environments are sensitive to disturbances that alter the hydrology (e.g., water impoundments), substrate (e.g., debris torrents), and riparian vegetation (e.g., wildfires) of river ecosystems. Although rivers are often very dynamic, disturbances can push environmental baselines outside of narrowly defined ecological tolerances under which a species evolved. Short-lived lotic-dependent organisms, restricted to movements within the water or the riparian corridor, are at risk of local extirpations owing to such disturbances if they fragment and isolate affected populations from recolonizing source populations. In Oregon, USA, the foothill yellow-legged frog (Rana boylii) is at its northernmost range margin and has experienced an approximately 41% range contraction compared to their historical distribution. To inform conservation and management, we used species distribution models to identify environmentally suitable watersheds based on intrinsic baseline environmental variables, and then examined potential effects of human-caused alterations to rivers, including splash dams used to ferry timber downstream prior to 1957, large water impoundments, and adjacency to agricultural croplands. We used machine-learning in program Maxent and three different river layers that varied in extent and location of mapped rivers but contained distinct information to produce species distribution models which we then combined into a single ensemble model. Stream order, annual precipitation, and precipitation frequency were the highest ranked baseline environmental variables in most models. Watersheds with highly suitable baseline conditions in our ensemble model were negatively correlated with anthropogenic disturbances to rivers. Foothill yellow-legged frogs appeared to be sensitive to human-caused disturbances to rivers, perhaps indicative of their narrow ecological tolerance to in-river conditions. We do not anticipate variables in our model to change much through time. Rather, for conservation we identified potential legacy (spash dams) and ongoing human-caused disturbances that are more likely to change conditions for the species in the short- and long-term.",

Significant variation in bird abundance was observed among different habitat types, farmlands being more specious followed by pure forests, water bodies and forest-farmland interfaces. Among the seasons, summers recorded higher abundance followed by winter, monsoon and post-monsoon. A low diversity value (H'=2.22) however was observed for the whole study area with mean monthly highest recorded during February (H'=2.44) and least during June (H'=1.85). Most of the raptors observed for their food types and foraging were predators (n=22) and rest were carrion feeders (n=22). Fourteen among all observed diurnal raptors were winter visitors and 13 residents with 9 reported globally threatened. A moderately high richness of diurnal raptors substantiate high conservation value of these habitats especially the forest patches and farmlands and thus calls for effective management strategies for the conservation and proliferation of raptors in sub-tropical areas of Jammu region.",

    "abstract": "Tooth resorption (TR) is one of the most common dental diseases in cats. It is a painful disease characterised by progressive dental destruction, which eventually results in loss of teeth. The aetiology of the disease remains unclear, but associations with old age, breed, other oral and dental diseases, and certain environmental factors have been suspected. We collected health and environmental information of 8115 Finnish cats from 41 breeds through an online survey for cat owners to study TR in Finland with an observational study. The frequency of TR that the owner reported as veterinarian-diagnosed was 3.9% in the entire data (316/8115) and 15% in cats that the owner reported as having veterinarian-diagnosed oral or dental disease (316/2070). We determined the risk factors and breed variation of feline TR by logistic regression with the entire data and a case-control study in a more defined population drawn from the entire data. In the entire data, we defined those cats that the owners had reported as being diagnosed with TR by a veterinarian as TR-cats and compared them to all other cats. In the case-control study, we included only cats with owner-reported veterinarian-diagnosed oral and dental diseases. We defined cats with TR-diagnosis made under sedation as TR-cases. Other veterinarian-diagnosed TR-cats were excluded. Cats with other oral and dental diseases were used as controls. The model with the entire population included 308 TR-cats compared with 7508 cats, and the case-control study included 198 TR-cats and 1683 controls. Although the diagnoses were reportedly made by a veterinarian, the owner answered the survey and might have understood, remembered, or interpreted the diagnoses in a way that could affect the results. The results indicated an increasing risk of TR with age. Dental calculus, gingivitis, and periodontitis were potential risk factors for TR. These findings and the interaction between dental calculus and gingivitis suggest that inflammatory changes caused by dental calculus increase the risk of TR. Keeping food available constantly was a potential protective factor. We found that Cornish Rex, European, and Ragdoll breeds were at higher risk for TR. The observed differences between breeds highlight a genetic contribution.",

    "abstract": "This pilot study examined the effect of inspiratory muscle training (IMT) on repeated-sprint ability and vastus lateralis reoxygenation. Ten recreationally trained subjects were randomly divided into two groups to complete 4 weeks of IMT or Sham (placebo) training. Pre- and post-intervention, a repeated-sprint ability (RSA) test was performed in both normoxia and hypoxia (FiO2 {approx} 14.5%). Vastus lateralis reoxygenation (VLreoxy), defined as peak to minimum amplitude deoxyhaemoglobin for each sprint/recovery cycle, was assessed during all trials using near-infrared spectroscopy. For total work performed, power analysis revealed that for small, medium and large effects (Cohens f), sample sizes of n = 8, 16 and 90 respectively, are required to achieve a power of 80% at an  level of 0.05. Maximal inspiratory mouth pressure increased in IMT by 36.5%, 95% CI [20.9, 61.6] and by 2.7%, 95% CI [-4.46, 8.8] in Sham. No clear difference in the change of work completed during the sprints between groups were observed in normoxia (Sham -0.805 kJ, 95% CI [-3.92, 0.39]; IMT -2.06 kJ, 95% CI [-11.5, 4.96]; P = 0.802), or hypoxia (Sham -3.09 kJ, 95% CI [-7, 0.396]; IMT 0.354 kJ, 95% CI [-1.49, 2.1]; P = 0.802). VLreoxy in IMT increased by 9.34%, 95% CI [5.15, 13.7] in normoxia only. In conclusion, despite a large increase in IMT, this was only associated with a small effect on RSA in our pilot study cohort. Owing to a potentially relevant impact of training the inspiratory musculature, future studies should include a sample size of at least 16-20 to detect moderate to large effects on RSA.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of human Chagas disease, is endemic to the southern region of the United States where it routinely infects many host species. The indoor/outdoor housing configuration used in many non-human primate research and breeding facilities in the southern U.S. provides the opportunity for infection by T. cruzi and thus provides source material for in-depth investigation of host and parasite dynamics in a natural host species under highly controlled and restricted conditions. For cynomolgus macaques housed at such a facility, we used a combination of serial blood quantitative PCR (qPCR) and hemoculture to confirm infection in >92% of seropositive animals, although each method alone failed to detect infection in >20% of cases. Parasite isolates obtained from 43 of the 64 seropositive macaques were of 2 broad genetic types (discrete typing units, (DTUs) I and IV); both within and between these DTU groupings, isolates displayed a wide variation in growth characteristics and virulence, elicited host immune responses, and susceptibility to drug treatment in a mouse model. Likewise, the macaques displayed a diversity in T cell and antibody response profiles that rarely correlated with parasite DTU type, length of infection, or age of the primate. This study reveals the complexity of infection dynamics, parasite phenotypes, and immune response patterns that can occur in a primate group, despite being housed in a uniform environment at a single location, and the limited time period over which the T. cruzi infections were established.\n\nAuthor SummaryWe evaluated naturally occurring infections of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of human Chagas disease, in an indoor/outdoor primate colony at a breeding facility in Texas, USA. Using serial quantitative PCR and hemoculture, we confirmed infection in 92% of the 64 seropositive animals, but neither of these two methods confirmed more than 80% of the cases. Parasites by hemoculture fell into two genetic groups (discrete typing units I and IV), and displayed large variation in growth characteristics, elicited cellular and humoral immune responses as well as virulence and drug susceptibility when tested in mice. EKG abnormalities were found in 13 out of 51 qPCR-positive macaques. Our results demonstrate the complexity of these infection parameters in this colony in spite of the uniform and geographically constrained housing conditions of the macaques.",

Several studies have explored the link between climate and dengue outbreaks in New Caledonia. None of them have explored the evolution of the dengue outbreak risk facing climate change.\n\nMethodology/Principal FindingsIn this study we chose the threshold time dependent reproduction number (Rt) as the modeling target to focus on time frames suitable for outbreak growths. A weekly statistical model of dengue outbreak risk (i.e. dengue outbreak probability) based on climate variables was developed using support vector machines (SVM) and then used in combination with CMIP5 projections of rainfall and temperature to estimate the future evolution of seasonal weekly risk and the inter-annual yearly risk of dengue outbreak up to the year 2100. The weekly risk of dengue outbreak is estimated using the number of days with maximal temperature exceeding 30.8{degrees}C during 80 days preceding the predicted week and the mean of precipitation during 60 days preceding the predicted week. According to the SVM model and to the worst greenhouse gas emission scenario projection (RCP8.5), the time frame suitable for epidemic growth will gain one month starting in November instead of December and the yearly risk of dengue outbreak occurrence increases regularly up to 2100 and reach a probability of 1 around 2080, making the dynamic of dengue fever endemic in New Caledonia.\n\nConclusions/SignificanceA complete method to assess seasonal and inter annual variability of the risk of dengue outbreaks with respect to climate change is proposed. We conclude that climate change is likely to increase the risk of dengue in New-Caledonia (the other non climatic parameters remaining constant) in terms of both frequency of outbreak and temporal spread of the outbreak.\n\nAuthor summaryDengue virus is transmitted to human through the bite of an Aedes mosquito vector. Dengue fever is a worldwide public health concern, especially on tropical and subtropical countries. Over the last decade, the toll of dengue fever has increased in New Caledonia, raising questions about the future of the disease in this French island territory located in the South Pacific. Climate has a strong influence on dengue through its influence on the ecology of the vector and the viral cycle. Several studies have explored the link between climate and dengue in New Caledonia, with the aim of explaining and predicting dengue outbreaks. None of these studies have explored the possible outcome climate change will have on the risk of dengue fever in New Caledonia. This is the goal of this study, through projections of rainfall and temperature and the selection of an appropriate prediction target for our statistical model, we assess the climate-induced risk of dengue outbreaks up to the 2100 horizon. We prove that the inter-annual risk of dengue outbreaks in New Caledonia will raise, according to all the greenhouse gas emission scenarios and according to the high emission scenario, dengue fever will become an endemic disease in New Caledonia.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro behavior of human dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (hDPSCs) cultured on scaffolds of three hydroxyapatite-based materials: hydroxyapatite microspheres [HAp]; amoxicillin-hydroxyapatite composite [Amx-HAp]; and collagen-hydroxyapatite composite [Col-HAp]. These hydroxyapatites (HAps) were synthesized through three methods: microwave hydrothermal, hydrothermal reactor (teflon pouches), and precipitation, respectively. We performed an in vitro experimental study using dental pulp stem cells obtained from samples of third molars and characterized by immunophenotypic analysis. Cells were cultured on scaffolds with osteogenic differentiation medium and were maintained for 21 days. Cytotoxicity analysis and migration assay of hDPSCs were evaluated. Each experiment was performed in triplicate. Data analysis was performed using Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunns post-hoc test. After 21 days of induction, no differences in genes expression were observed. hDPSCs highly expressed the collagen IA and the osteonectin at the mRNA, which indicated these genes plays an important role in odontogenesis regardless of induction stimulus. Cytotoxicity assay using hDPSCs demonstrated that Col-HAp group presented a number of non-viable cells statistically lower than the control group (p=0.03). In the migration assay after 24h, biomaterials HAp, Amx-HAp, and Col-HAp revealed the same migration behavior for hDPSCs observed to the positive control. Col-HAp also provided a statistically significant higher migration of hDPSCs than HAp (p=0.02). The migration results in 48h for HAp, Amx-HAp, and Col-HAp was intermediate from those achieved by control groups. There was no statistical difference between positive control and Col-HAp (p>0.05). In general, Col-HAp scaffold showed better features for these dynamic parameters of cell viability and cell migration capacities for hDPSCs, leading to suitable adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation of this osteogenic lineage. These data present high clinical importance because Col-HAp can be used in a wide variety of therapeutic areas, including ridge preservation, minor bone augmentation, and periodontal regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Around the Perhentian Islands, coral reefs have been undergoing degradation, as is reported by coral reef monitoring programmes. Current coral reef surveys around the Perhentian Islands do not specifically monitor hosting sea anemone populations, nor do they include investigation of how sea anemone abundance correlates to live coral cover on reef sites. As sea anemones can compete with corals for suitable substrate, nutrients, and light availability, the current study was designed to explore hosting sea anemone abundance and distribution patterns around the Perhentian Islands, as well as assess the presence of significant correlations between sea anemone abundance and live coral cover. Two sites with hosting sea anemone populations were assessed, and data was collected for sea anemone species, formation type, hosting status, and resident Amphiprion species. Additionally, live coral cover estimates were calculated and tested for associations between coral and sea anemone abundance. In total, 403 hosting sea anemone formations were analysed. Statistical analyses revealed that at the research site Village Reef, sea anemones that were actively hosting were larger, and more often encountered in clustered formations. In addition, sea anemone cover was significantly negatively correlated to live coral cover. At research site Teluk Keke, actively hosting sea anemones were also larger, but no other tests revealed significant results at this site. The current study offers a first population analysis of hosting sea anemone assemblages around the Perhentian Islands and provides a preliminary exploration of the associations between hosting sea anemone presence and live coral cover on these reefs.",

    "abstract": "The great ethnolinguistic diversity found today in mainland Southeast Asia (MSEA) reflects multiple migration waves of people in the past. Deeply divergent East Eurasian hunter-gatherers were the first anatomically modern human population known to migrate to the region. Agriculturalists from South China migrated to the region and admixed with the local hunter-gatherers during the Neolithic period. During the Bronze and Iron Ages, the genetic makeup of people in MSEA changed again, indicating an additional influx of populations from South China. Maritime trading between MSEA and India was established at the latest 300 BCE, and the formation of early states in Southeast Asia during the first millennium CE was strongly influenced by Indian culture, and this cultural influence is still prominent today. Several ancient Indian-influenced states were located in present-day Thailand, and various populations in the country are likely to be descendants of people from those states. To systematically explore Indian genetic heritage in MSEA, we generated genome-wide SNP data (the HumanOrigins array) for 119 present-day individuals belonging to 10 ethnic groups from Thailand and co-analyzed them with published data from MSEA using the PCA, ADMIXTURE, f3-statistics, qpAdm, and qpGraph methods. We found South Asian low-level admixture in various MSEA populations which are probably descendants of people from the ancient Indian-influenced states, but failed to find a South Asian genetic component in present-day hunter-gatherer groups and relatively isolated groups from highlands in Northern Thailand. Our results also support close genetic affinity between Kra-Dai-speaking (also known as Tai-Kadai) and Austronesian-speaking populations, which fits a linguistic hypothesis suggesting cladality of the two language families.\n\nAuthor SummaryMainland Southeast Asia is a region with great ethnolinguistic diversity and complex population history. We studied genetic population history of present-day mainland Southeast Asian populations using genome-wide SNP data (the HumanOrigins array). We generated new data for 10 present-day ethnic groups from Thailand, which we further combined with published data from mainland and island Southeast Asians and worldwide populations. We revealed South Asian genetic admixture in various mainland Southeast Asian ethnic groups which are highly influenced by Indian culture, but failed to find it in groups who remained culturally isolated until recently. Our finding suggests that a massive migration of Indian people in the past was responsible for the spread of Indian culture in mainland Southeast Asia. We also found support for a close genetic affinity between Kra-Dai- and Austronesianspeaking populations, which fits a linguistic hypothesis suggesting cladality of the two language families.",

However, a considerable proportion of patients remain unresponsive to them. Hence, the development of novel clinical immunotherapeutic approaches and/or targets are crucial. In this context, targeting the immune-checkpoint HLA-G/ILT2/ILT4 has caused great interest since it is abnormally expressed in several malignancies generating a tolerogenic microenvironment. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to block the HLA-G expression in two tumor cell lines expressing HLA-G, including a renal cell carcinoma (RCC7) and a choriocarcinoma (JEG-3). Different sgRNA/Cas9 plasmids targeting HLA-G exon 1 and 2 were transfected in both cell lines. Downregulation of HLA-G was reached to different degrees, including complete silencing. Most importantly, HLA-G - cells triggered a higher in vitro response of immune cells with respect to HLA-G + wild type cells. Altogether, we demonstrated for the first time the HLA-G downregulation through gene editing. We propose this approach as a first step to develop novel clinical immunotherapeutic approaches in cancer.",

UPSIT scores and ON FC values were significantly correlated, reflecting the effects of PD pathologies.\n\nConclusionsThe results show that olfactory function differs between PDAR and PDT suggesting a correlation between PD-related motor symptoms and olfactory deficits. ON FC differences accounts for the impaired olfactory functions observed between PDAR and PDT.

A helix extension in the TPR functions as a key recognition element, interacting across the Hsp90 C-terminal dimer interface presented in the closed, ATP conformation. The PPIase domain is positioned along the middle domain, adjacent Hsp90 client binding sites, while a single p23 makes stabilizing interactions with the N-terminal dimer. With this architecture, FKBP51 could thereby act on specific client residues presented during Hsp90-catalyzed remodeling.",

SUMIC permits quantitative and singlecell resolution analysis and detection of rare cells in whole organs, for example, round SMA positive cells in the thymus. Upon volumetric imaging, SUMIC-processed samples retain normal tissue architecture and can be used for paraffin-embedding and histology.

    "abstract": "Neutralizing antibodies targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) are among the most promising approaches against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1,2. We developed a bispecific, IgG1-like molecule (CoV-X2) based on two antibodies derived from COVID-19 convalescent donors, C121 and C1353. CoV-X2 simultaneously binds two independent sites on the RBD and, unlike its parental antibodies, prevents detectable S binding to Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the virus cellular receptor. Furthermore, CoV-X2 neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern, as well as the escape mutants generated by the parental monoclonals. In a novel animal model of SARS-CoV-2 infection with lung inflammation, CoV-X2 protects mice from disease and suppresses viral escape. Thus, simultaneous targeting of non-overlapping RBD epitopes by IgG-like bispecific antibodies is feasible and effective, combining into a single molecule the advantages of antibody cocktails.",

    "abstract": "To cope with sudden changes in their environment, bacteria can use a bet-hedging strategy by dividing the population into cells with different properties. This so-called bimodal or bistable cellular differentiation is generally controlled by positive feedback regulation of transcriptional activators. Due to the continuous increase in cell volume, it is difficult for these activators to reach an activation threshold concentration when cells are growing exponentially. This is one reason why bimodal differentiation is primarily observed from the onset of the stationary phase when exponential growth ceases. An exception is the bimodal induction of motility in Bacillus subtilis, which occurs early during exponential growth. Several mechanisms have been put forward to explain this, including double negative-feedback regulation and the stability of the mRNA molecules involved. In this study, we used fluorescence-assisted cell sorting to compare the transcriptome of motile and non-motile cells and noted that expression of ribosomal genes is lower in motile cells. This was confirmed using an unstable GFP reporter fused to the strong ribosomal rpsD promoter. We propose that the reduction in ribosomal gene expression in motile cells is the result of a diversion of cellular resources to the synthesis of the chemotaxis and motility systems. In agreement, single-cell microscopic analysis showed that motile cells are slightly shorter than non-motile cells, an indication of slower growth. We speculate that this growth rate reduction can contribute to the bimodal induction of motility during exponential growth.\n\nIMPORTANCETo cope with sudden environmental changes, bacteria can use a bet-hedging strategy and generate different types of cells within a population, so called bimodal differentiation. For example, a Bacillus subtilis culture can contain both motile and non-motile cells. In this study we compared the gene expression between motile and non-motile cells. It appeared that motile cells express less ribosomes. To confirm this, we constructed a ribosomal promoter fusion that enabled us to measure expression of this promoter in individual cells. This reporter fusion confirmed our initial finding. The re-allocation of cellular resources from ribosome synthesis towards synthesis of the motility apparatus results in a reduction in growth. Interestingly, this growth reduction has been shown to stimulate bimodal differentiation.",

    "abstract": "Reciprocal exchanges of DNA (crossovers) that occur during meiosis are mandatory to ensure the production of fertile gametes in sexually reproducing species. They also contribute to shuffle parental alleles into new combinations thereby fuelling genetic variation and evolution. However, due to biological constraints, the recombination landscape is highly heterogenous along the genome which limits the range of allelic combinations and the adaptability of populations. An approach to better understand the constraints on the recombination process is to study how it evolved in the past. In this work we tackled this question by constructing recombination profiles in four diverging bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) populations established from 371 landraces genotyped at 200,062 SNPs. We used linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns to estimate in each population the past distribution of recombination along the genome and characterize its fine-scale heterogeneity. At the megabase scale, recombination rates derived from LD patterns were consistent with family-based estimates obtained from a population of 406 recombinant inbred lines. Among the four populations, recombination landscapes were significantly positively correlated between each other and shared a statistically significant proportion of highly recombinant intervals. However, this comparison also highlighted that the similarity in recombination landscapes between populations was significantly decreasing with their genetic differentiation in most regions of the genome. This observation was found to be robust to SNP ascertainment and demography and suggests a relatively rapid evolution of factors determining the fine-scale localization of recombination in bread wheat.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAdvances in DNA sequencing have reduced the difficulty of sequencing and assembling plant genomes. A range of methods for long read sequencing and assembly have been recently compared and we now extend the earlier study and report a comparison with more recent methods.\n\nResultsUpdated Oxford Nanopore Technology software supported improved assemblies. The use of more accurate sequences produced by repeated sequencing of the same molecule (PacBio HiFi) resulted in much less fragmented assembly of sequencing reads. The use of more data to give increased genome coverage resulted in longer contigs (higher N50) but reduced the total length of the assemblies and improved genome completeness (BUSCO). The original model species, Macadamia jansenii, a basal eudicot, was also compared with the 3 other Macadamia species and with avocado (Persea americana), a magnoliid, and jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis) a core eudicot. In these phylogenetically diverse angiosperms, increasing sequence data volumes also caused a highly linear increase in contig size, decreased assembly length and further improved already high completeness. Differences in genome size and sequence complexity apparently influenced the success of assembly from these different species.\n\nConclusionsAdvances in long read sequencing technology have continued to significantly improve the results of sequencing and assembly of plant genomes. However, results were consistently improved by greater genome coverage (using an increased number of reads) with the amount needed to achieve a particular level of assembly being species dependant.",

    "abstract": "Plants employ cell surface receptors to recognize pathogen (or microbe)-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs), which are crucial for immune system activation. The well-studied Arabidopsis thaliana ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) recognizes the conserved bacterial PAMP EF-Tu, and the derived peptides elf18 and elf26. The interfamily transfer of EFR has been shown to increase disease resistance in several crops, such as tomato, rice, wheat, and potato. Here, we generated sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) transgenic lines expressing EFR to test if it would confer broad-spectrum resistance against two important citrus bacterial diseases: citrus canker and citrus variegated chlorosis (CVC). Independent EFR transgenic lines gained responsiveness to elf18 and elf26 peptides from Xanthomonas citri and Xylella fastidiosa, as measured by reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and defense gene expression. Consistently, infection assays showed that Citrus-EFR transgenic plants were more resistant to citrus canker and CVC. Our results show that the EFR immune receptor can improve plant immunity in a perennial crop against bacterial pathogens, opening perspectives to engineer durable broad-spectrum disease resistance under field conditions.",

    "abstract": "Within animal associated microbiomes, the functional roles of specific microbial taxa are often uncharacterized. Here, we use the fungus-growing ant system, a model for microbial symbiosis, to determine the potential defensive roles of key bacterial taxa present in the ants fungus gardens. Fungus gardens serve as an external digestive system for the ants, with mutualistic fungi in the genus Leucoagaricus spp. converting plant substrate into energy for the ants. The fungus garden is host to specialized parasitic fungi in the genus Escovopsis. Here, we examine the potential role of Burkholderia spp. that occur within ant fungus gardens in inhibiting Escovopsis. We isolated members of the bacterial genera Burkholderia spp. and Paraburkholderia spp. from 50% of the 52 colonies sampled, indicating that the family Burkholderiaceae are common fungus garden inhabitants of a diverse range of fungus-growing ant genera. Using antimicrobial inhibition bioassays, we found that 28 out of 32 isolates inhibited at least one Escovopsis strain with a zone of inhibition greater than 1 cm. Genomic assessment of Burkholderiaceae isolates indicated that isolates with strong inhibition all belonged to the genus Burkholderia and contained biosynthetic gene clusters that encoded the production of two antifungals: burkholdine1213 and pyrrolnitrin. Organic extracts of cultured isolates confirmed these compounds as responsible for antifungal activity that inhibit Escovopsis but, at low concentrations, not Leucoagaricus spp. Overall, these new findings, combined with previous evidence, suggest that members of the fungus garden microbiome play an important role in maintaining the health and function of the fungus-farming ant colony.\n\nIMPORTANCEMany organisms partner with microbes to defend themselves against parasites and pathogens. Fungus-growing ants must protect Leucoagaricus spp., the fungal mutualist that provides sustenance for the ants, from a specialized fungal parasite, Escovopsis spp. The ants take multiple approaches, including weeding their fungus gardens to remove Escovopsis spores, as well as harboring Pseudonocardia that produce antifungals that inhibit Escovopsis. In addition, a genus of bacteria commonly found in fungus gardens, Burkholderia spp., is known to produce secondary metabolites that inhibit Escovopsis spp. In this study, we isolated Burkholderia spp. from fungus-growing ants, assessed the isolates ability to inhibit Escovopsis spp., and identified two compounds responsible for inhibition. Our findings suggest that Burkholderia spp. are often found in fungus gardens, adding another possible mechanism within the fungus-growing ant system to suppress the growth of the specialized parasite Escovopsis.",

    "abstract": "Large-scale movement of organisms across their habitable range, or migration, is an important evolutionary process that can contribute to observed patterns of genetic diversity and our understanding of the adaptive spread of alleles. While human migrations have been studied in great detail with modern and ancient genomes, recent anthropogenic influence on reducing the biogeographical constraints on the migration of non-native species has presented opportunities in several study systems to ask the questions about how repeated introductions shape genetic diversity in the introduced range. We present here the most comprehensive view of population structure of North American Arabidopsis thaliana by studying a set of 500 (whole-genome sequenced) and over 2800 (RAD-seq genotyped) individuals in the context of global diversity represented by Afro-Eurasian genomes. We use haplotype-sharing, phylogenetic modeling and rare-allele sharing based methods to identify putative sources of introductions of extant N. American A. thaliana from the native range of Afro-Eurasia. We find evidence of admixture among the introduced lineages that has resulted in the increased haplotype diversity and reduced mutational load. Further, we also present signals of selection in the immune-system related genes that impart qualitative disease resistance to pathogens of bacterial and oomycete origins. Thus, multiple introductions to a non-native range can quickly increase adaptive potential of a colonizing species by increasing haplotypic diversity through admixture. The results presented here lay the foundation for further investigations into the functional significance of admixture.",

    "abstract": "Understanding speech presented in competition with other sound sources can be challenging. Here, we reason that this task can be facilitated by improving the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in either of the two ears and that in free-field listening scenarios, this can be achieved by attenuating contralateral sounds. We present a binaural (pre)processing algorithm that improves the SNR in the ear ipsilateral to the target sound source by linear subtraction of the weighted contralateral stimulus. Although the weight is regarded as a free parameter, we justify setting it equal to the ratio of ipsilateral to contralateral head-related transfer functions averaged over an appropriate azimuth range. The algorithm is implemented in the frequency domain and evaluated technically and experimentally for normal-hearing listeners in simulated free-field conditions. Results show that (1) it can substantially improve the SNR (up to 20 dB) and the short-term intelligibility metric in the ear ipsilateral to the target source, particularly for speech-like maskers; (2) it can improve speech reception thresholds for sentences in competition with speech-shaped noise by up to 8.5 dB in bilateral listening and 10.0 dB in unilateral listening; (3) it hardly affects sound-source localization; and (4) the improvements, and the algorithms directivity pattern depend on the weights. The algorithm accounts qualitatively for binaural unmasking for speech in competition with multiple maskers and for multiple target-masker spatial arrangements, an unexpected property that can inspire binaural intelligibility models.",
