    "abstract": "Caspases are required for execution of apoptosis. However, in their absence, signals that typically induce apoptosis can still result in cell death. Our laboratory previously demonstrated that Casp3-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have increased fibronectin (FN) secretion, and an adhesion-dependent survival advantage compared to wild type (WT) MEFs. Here, we show that FN is required for survival of Casp3-deficient MEFs following serum withdrawal. Furthermore, when FN is silenced, serum withdrawal-induced death is caspase-independent. However, procaspase-7 is cleaved, suggesting that MOMP is taking place. Indeed, in the absence of FN, cytochrome c release is increased following serum withdrawal in Casp3-deficient MEFs. Yet death does not correspond to cytochrome c release in Casp3-deficient MEFs. This is true both in the presence and absence of FN. Additionally, caspase-independent death is inhibited by Bcl-XL overexpression. These findings suggest that Bcl-XL is not inhibiting death through regulation of Bax/Bak insertion into the mitochondria, but through a different mechanism. One such possibility is autophagy and induction of autophagy is associated with caspase-independent death in Casp3-deficient cells. Importantly, when ATG5 is ablated in Casp3-deficient cells, autophagy is blocked and death is largely inhibited. Taken together, our data indicate that Casp3-deficient cells incapable of undergoing canonical serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis, are protected from autophagy-dependent death by FN-mediated adhesion.",

    "abstract": "The BMP and FGF pathways play a pivotal role in the successful regeneration of caudal fin of teleost fish. Individual inhibition of these pathways led to impaired caudal fin regeneration until the pharmacologic inhibitor of FGF (SU5402) and BMP (LDN193189) were metabolized off. Therefore, in the current study both these pathways were inhibited collectively wherein inhibition of BMP and FGF during the wound epithelium formation led to stalling of the process by bringing down the established levels of shh and runx2. In members of the treatment group, it was observed that, each blastema grows crouched rather than linear and the regrown lepidotrichia therefore remain tilted down. Amongst the other irregularities observed, the transition from epithelial to mesenchymal cells was found hindered due to down-regulation of snail and twist, brought about by BMP and FGF inhibition. Compromised expression of Snail and twist deranged the normal levels of cadherins causing disruption in the transition of cells. Lastly, blocking BMP and FGF delayed blastema formation and proliferation due to diminished levels of fgf2, fgf8, fgf10 and bmp6, while casp3 and casp9 levels remained heightened causing accelerated cell death. This study not only highlights the axial role of BMP and FGF pathways in regeneration but also accentuates the collaboration amongst the two. This ingenious coordination of signalling further reinforces the involvement of relaying messenger molecules between these crucial pathways.\n\nSummary StatementBMP and FGF collectively control the process of blastema formation in fish and inhibiting them prior to wound epithelium stage leads to irrevocable damage to the regenerating caudal fin.",

    "abstract": "Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have great potential for disease modeling. However, generating iPSC-derived models to study brain diseases remains a challenge. In particular, the ability to recapitulate cerebellar development in vitro is still limited. We presented a reproducible and scalable production of cerebellar organoids by using the novel Vertical-Wheel single-use bioreactors, in which functional cerebellar neurons were obtained. Here, we evaluate the global gene expression profiles by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) across cerebellar differentiation, demonstrating a faster cerebellar commitment in this novel dynamic differentiation protocol. Furthermore, transcriptomic profiles suggest a significant enrichment of extracellular matrix (ECM) in dynamic-derived cerebellar organoids, which can better mimic the neural microenvironment and support a consistent neuronal network. Thus, an efficient generation of organoids with cerebellar identity was achieved for the first time in a continuous process using a dynamic system without the need of organoids encapsulation in ECM-based hydrogels, allowing the possibility of large-scale production and application in high-throughput processes. The presence of factors that favors angiogenesis onset was also detected in dynamic condition, which can enhance functional maturation of cerebellar organoids. We anticipate that large-scale production of cerebellar organoids may help developing models for drug screening, toxicological tests and studying pathological pathways involved in cerebellar degeneration.",

    "abstract": "53BP1 is a key DNA repair protein that regulates double strand break (DSB) repair pathway choice. It assembles a complex, whose loss reverses BRCA1 deficient cells sensitivity to PARP1 inhibitors potentially by antagonizing DSB end resection. 53BP1 is critical for immunoglobulin heavy chain class switch recombination (CSR), that is mediated by the generation and repair of DSBs. Here we identify a deubiquitylase, USP47, as a 53BP1 associated protein that regulates its function in these processes. USP47 loss results in 53BP1 protein instability in a proteasome dependent manner and in reduced 53BP1 ionizing radiation induced foci (IRIF). Like 53BP1, USP47 depletion results in enhanced homologous recombination repair, and defective immunoglobulin CSR. It is also required for resistance to DNA damaging agents. We identify a complex of 53BP1, USP47, Fen1, and Recql1 that regulates a microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ), a repair pathway that is involved in CSR. Altogether, our findings implicate USP47 in DNA DSB repair at least through regulating a novel 53BP1 associated complex.",

    "abstract": "I{kappa}B kinase 2/{beta} (IKK2) is a critical regulator of inflammation which is inducibly activated by a host of stimuli. Aberrant activation of IKK2 is the leading cause of most inflammatory diseases and many associated cancers. Efforts to prevent these diseases by small-molecule inhibitors of IKK2 activity have not been successful. Most inhibitors developed for IKK2 are ATP-competitive, and they are toxic in vivo due to their off-target effects. Here we focused on identifying inhibitors to block IKK2 activity from an allosteric site, not the ATP-binding pocket. Using virtual screening, we first identified several candidate allosteric sites and screened for potential small-molecule binders, and then selected candidates inhibitory to IKK2 activity using cell-based functional assays. Hydrogen deuterium exchange coupled to mass-spectrometry (HDX-MS) and MS-MS assays revealed that a class of benzoyl conjugates of pyrrolidinedione covalently bound to a site located at the interface of the kinase domain (KD) and the helical domain (SDD), and inhibited IKK2 activation allosterically by preventing phosphorylation of its activation loop serines. Additionally, this class of inhibitor partially blocks IKK2s catalytic activity by enhancing dynamics within the ATP binding pocket and likely the general active site. Hydrogen deuterium exchange (HDX) experiments further revealed that while binding of substrate ATP perturbs only the local structure surrounding its binding site, binding to ATP-competitive or allosteric inhibitors induces structural perturbations in an expansive area including the helical domain. We propose that these allosteric sites can act as specific targets for the development of novel potent IKK inhibitors.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAberrant activation of IKK2 is the leading cause of most inflammatory diseases and many associated cancers.

By combination of virtual screening and cell-based functional assays, we identified small-molecule binders of the class of benzoyl conjugates of pyrrolidinedione that block IKK2 activity from an allosteric site through covalent attachment and could be specific only for IKK2. HDX-MS and MS-MS assays identified a binding pocket with a  Cys-Cys motif for these inhibitors, and revealed specific differences in IKK2 dynamics upon binding to substrate ATP vs ATP-competitive and allosteric inhibitors.

CNVnator is one of the most popular tools for CNV/CNA discovery and analysis based on read depth (RD). Herein, we present an extension of CNVnator developed in Python -- CNVpytor. CNVpytor inherits the reimplemented core engine of its predecessor and extends visualization, modularization, performance, and functionality. Additionally, CNVpytor uses B-allele frequency (BAF) likelihood information from single nucleotide polymorphism and small indels data as additional evidence for CNVs/CNAs and as primary information for copy number neutral losses of heterozygosity. CNVpytor is significantly faster than CNVnator--particularly for parsing alignment files (2 to 20 times faster)--and has (20-50 times) smaller intermediate files. CNV calls can be filtered using several criteria and annotated. Modular architecture allows it to be used in shared and cloud environments such as Google Colab and Jupyter notebook. Data can be exported into JBrowse, while a lightweight plugin version of CNVpytor for JBrowse enables nearly instant and GUI-assisted analysis of CNVs by any user.

Here we report that genetic mouse model with a reduced medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) dopamine levels, arising from astrocyte-specific conditional deletion of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2; aVMTA2cKO mice) shows excessive grooming and anxiety-like behaviour. The VMAT2cKO mice also develop a synaptic pathology, expressed through increased relative AMPA vs. NMDA receptor currents in synapses of the dorsal striatum receiving inputs from the mPFC. Importantly, behavioural and synaptic phenotypes are prevented by reexpression of mPFC VMAT2, showing that the deficits are driven by mPFC astrocytes. By analysing human tissue samples, we found that VMAT2 is expressed in human mPFC astrocytes, corroborating the potential translational relevance of our observations in mice. Our study shows that impairments of the astrocytic-control of dopamine in the mPFC has a profound impact on circuit function and behaviours, which resemble symptoms of anxiety disorders and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).",

From these data, we determined the structure of P. pastoris FAS to 3.1 [A] resolution. While the overall organisation of the complex was typical of type I FASs, we identified several differences in both structural and enzymatic domains through comparison with the prototypical yeast FAS from S. cerevisiae. Using focussed classification, we were also able to resolve and model the mobile acyl-carrier protein (ACP) domain, which is key for function. Ultimately, the structure reported here will be a useful resource for further efforts to engineer yeast FAS for synthesis of alternate products.",

BOR has an incidence of 1/40,000 and is characterized by congenital branchial fistulas, malformations of the inner ear and kidney hypoplasia. Therapeutic interventions for BOR are currently limited to reparative surgery, hearing aids and dialysis. Here we use the mechanosensory lateral line in zebrafish to better understand the role of Eya1 in organogenesis. The lateral line develops from a primordium formed by approximately 150 cells that move together from head to tail of the embryo at a constant velocity. This invariant migration occurs over a trail of Sdf1a chemokine and is controlled by the simultaneous action of two receptors. The CXCR4b is expressed in the front half of the primordium where it acts as a chemokine sensor, whereas the CXCR7b is present in the rear half, serving as a chemokine sink to ensure persistent directionality. We show that the loss of Eya1 strongly reduces the expression of CXCR7b, disrupting the coherent motion of the primordium and leading to lateral-line truncations. We also find evidence of reduced FGF signaling and epithelial maturation in primordia lacking Eya1. These findings argue for abnormal collective cell chemotaxis as the origin of organ dysmorphosis in BOR.",

    "abstract": "The catalytic trigger loop (TL) in RNA polymerase (RNAP) alternates between unstructured and helical hairpin conformations to admit and then contact the NTP substrate during transcription. In many bacterial lineages, the TL is interrupted by insertions of 2-5 surface-exposed, sandwich-barrel hybrid motifs (SBHMs) of poorly understood function. The 188-aa, 2-SBHM E. coli insertion, called SI3, occupies different locations in halted, NTP-bound, and paused transcription complexes, but its dynamics during active transcription and pausing are undefined. Here we report design, optimization, and use of a Cys-triplet reporter to measure the positional bias of SI3 in different transcription complexes and to determine the effect of restricting SI3 movement on nucleotide addition and pausing. We describe use of H2O2 as a superior oxidant for RNAP disulfide reporters. NTP binding biases SI3 toward the closed conformation whereas transcriptional pausing biases SI3 toward a swiveled position that inhibits TL folding. We find that SI3 must change location in every round of nucleotide addition and that restricting its movements inhibits both transcript elongation and pausing. These dynamics are modulated by a crucial Phe pocket formed by the junction of the two SBHM domains. This SI3 Phe pocket captures a Phe residue in the RNAP jaw when the TL unfolds, explaining the similar phenotypes of alterations in the jaw and SI3. Our findings establish that SI3 functions by modulating the TL folding to aid transcriptional regulation and to reset secondary channel trafficking in every round of nucleotide addition.\n\nSIGNIFICANCERNA synthesis by cellular RNA polymerases depends on an active-site component called the trigger loop that oscillates between an unstructured loop that admits NTP substrates and a helical hairpin that positions the NTP in every round of nucleotide addition. In most bacteria, the trigger loop contains a large, surface-exposed insertion module that occupies different positions in halted transcription complexes but whose function during active transcription is unknown. By developing and using a novel disulfide reporter system, we find the insertion module also must alternate between in and out positions for every nucleotide addition, must swivel to a paused position to support regulation, and, in enterobacteria, evolved a \"Phe pocket\" that captures a key phenylalanine in the out and swivel positions.",

    "abstract": "The atrioventricular canal (AVC) is an essential feature of the heart, which separates the atrium from the ventricle. During heart morphogenesis, it is a hub of molecular processes necessary for distinguishing heart regions; most importantly, for the formation of the AV conduction system and cardiac valves. To better understand the molecular processes underlying AVC development and function, we utilized the transgenic zebrafish line sqet31Et with EGFP expression in the AVC region to isolate this cell population by FACS and profiled its transcriptome by RNA-seq at 48 and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf). Compared to the rest of the heart, the AVC is enriched for the expression of molecular markers associated with mammalian AVC and AV node, including cx36.7 and cx45 which encode connexins forming low conductance gap junctions. Using the transgenic line Tg(myl7:mermaid) encoding the voltage-sensitive fluorescent protein, we showed that loss of function of Isl1 abolished the pacemaker-containing sinoatrial ring (SAR) and resulted in an erratic spread of excitation pattern from the SAR to AVC, indicating the dysfunction of the primary pacemaker. Concurrently, ectopic excitation in the AVC region was observed, suggesting that the zebrafish AVC possesses inherent automaticity although insufficient to replace the primary pacemaking activity of the SAR. Comparisons between the SAR and AVC transcriptomes revealed partially overlapping expression profiles of various ion channels and gap junction proteins which reflects their diversified functions. Lastly, we observed dynamic expression of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition markers, as well as components of TGF-{beta}, Notch, and Wnt signaling pathways, which have been implicated in the formation of AVC conduction and cardiac valves. Our results uncovered the molecular hallmarks of the developing AVC region and demonstrated its role in the structural and electrophysiological separation between the atrium and ventricle.\n\nAuthor summaryThe atrioventricular canal is a structure in the embryonic heart which separates the atrium from the ventricle. It gives rise to the AV node and cardiac valves - two important structures which ensure unidirectional blood flow between heart chambers. The AV node serves to regulate the propagation of electrical impulses between the two chambers, such that they contract consecutively. Using the zebrafish as model organism, we performed gene expression profiling and characterized electrical conduction patterns between the sinoatrial primary pacemaker and AVC. We discovered that the zebrafish AVC possesses similar features to the mammalian AV node, including slow conduction, inherent pacemaking activity, and the expression of conserved developmental genes. The molecular profile of the AVC is distinct from that of the sinoatrial pacemaker, which reflects their distinct roles. In addition, we found that genes regulating cardiac valve development were also expressed in the AVC, illustrating the importance of this region for establishing both electrophysiological and structural separation between the heart chambers. Besides establishing conserved aspects between zebrafish and mammalian conduction system, the data generated in this study constitutes a valuable resource for studying AVC development and discovery of novel candidate genes implicated in regulating cardiac rhythm and cardiac valve formation.",

    "abstract": "In principle, any cooperative behaviour can be evolutionarily stable as long as it is incentivized by a reward from the beneficiary, a mechanism that has been called reciprocal cooperation. However, what makes this mechanism so powerful also has an evolutionary downside. Reciprocal cooperation faces a chicken-and-egg problem of the same kind as communication: it requires two functions to evolve at the same time -cooperation and response to cooperation. As a result, it can only emerge if one side first evolves for another reason, and is then recycled into a reciprocal function. Developping an evolutionary model in which we make use of machine learning techniques, we show that this occurs if the fact to cooperate and reward others cooperation become general abilities that extend beyond the set of contexts for which they have initially been selected. Drawing on an evolutionary analogy with the concept of generalization, we identify the conditions necessary for this to happen. This allows us to understand the peculiar distribution of reciprocal cooperation in the wild, virtually absent in most species -or limited to situations where individuals have partially overlapping interests, but pervasive in the human species",

    "abstract": "The novel SARS_CoV-2 virus, prone to variation when interacting with spatially extended ecosystems and within hosts1 can be considered a complex dynamic system2. Therefore, it behaves creating several space-time manifestations of its dynamics. However, these physical manifestations in nature have not yet been fully disclosed or understood. Here we show 4-3 and 2-D space-time patterns of rate of infected individuals on a global scale, giving quantitative measures of transitions between different dynamical behaviour. By slicing the spatio-temporal patterns, we found manifestations of the virus behaviour such as cluster formation and bifurcations. Furthermore, by analysing the morphogenesis processes by entropy, we have been able to detect the virus phase transitions, typical of adaptive biological systems3. Our results for the first time describe the virus patterning behaviour processes all over the world, giving for them quantitative measures. We know that the outcomes of this work are still partial and more advanced analyses of the virus behaviour in nature are necessary. However, we think that the set of methods implemented can provide significant advantages to better analyse the viral behaviour in the approach of system biology4, thus expanding knowledge and improving pandemic problem solving.",

    "abstract": "Learning invariance across a set of transformations is an important step in mapping high-dimensional inputs to a limited number of classes. After understanding the set of\\ invariances, can a new class be learned from one element? We propose a representation which can facilitate such learning: if the variability in representing individual elements across trials aligns with the variability among different elements in a class, then class boundaries learned from the variable representations of one element should be representative of the entire class. In this study, we test whether such a representation occurs in mouse visual systems. We use Neuropixels probes recording single unit activity in mice observing 200 repeats of natural movies taken from a set of 9 continuous clips. We observe that the trial-by-trial variability in the representation of individual frames is well aligned to the variability in representation of multiple frames from the same clip, but not well aligned to the variability among frames from different clips. Thus, the variable representations of images in the mouse cortex can be efficiently used to classify images into their clips. We compare these representations to those in artificial neural networks. We find that, when introducing noise in networks trained for classification (both feed-forward and recurrent networks), the variability in the representation of elements aligns with the in-class variance. The networks which best reproduce the in-vivo observed directions of variability were those trained on a hierarchical classification task. Taken together, these results point to a solution which the cortex can use for one-shot learning of a class: by using noise as a mechanism for generalization. This is a potential computational explanation for the high level of noise observed in the cortex.",

    "abstract": "The degree of interaction between the ventral and dorsal visual streams has been discussed in multiple scientific domains for decades. Recently, several white matter tracts that directly connect cortical regions associated with the dorsal and ventral streams have become possible to study due to advancements in automated and reproducible methods. The developmental trajectory of this set of tracts, here referred to as the posterior vertical pathway (PVP), has yet to be described. We propose an input-driven model of white matter development and provide evidence for the model by focusing on the development of the PVP. We used reproducible, cloud-computing methods and diffusion imaging from adults and children (ages 5-8 years) to compare PVP development to that of tracts within the ventral and dorsal pathways. PVP microstructure was more adult-like than dorsal stream microstructure, but less adult-like than ventral stream microstructure. Additionally, PVP microstructure was more similar to the microstructure of the ventral than the dorsal stream and was predicted by performance on a perceptual task in children. Overall, results suggest a potential role for the PVP in the development of the dorsal visual stream that may be related to its ability to facilitate interactions between ventral and dorsal streams during learning. Our results are consistent with the proposed model, suggesting that the microstructural development of major white matter pathways is related, at least in part, to the propagation of sensory information within the visual system.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding white matter development is important to building predictive models that can inform interventions and targeted educational methods. We propose and provide evidence for an input-driven model of white matter development. We tested an uncharacterized aspect of human brain development. Namely, how the recently described posterior vertical white matter tracts develop. Our results suggest a developmental progression along the known, direct anatomical connections from posterior visual areas to anterior ventral and dorsal areas. Our results suggest fundamental biological mechanisms that clarify the role of white matter in predicting human learning and behavior.",

In this study, seven candidate genes (TUA, TUB, TIF, UBC, RPL21, RPL30, RPL34) were screened out from transcriptome data, we analyzed the expression of seven candidate reference genes in C. henryi at different germination stages with RT-qPCR, and using common algorithms including NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper to evaluate the candidate genes stability. The results showed that RPL34 and RPL30 were selected as the most stable genes by NormFinder; TIF was the most stable gene identified by BestKeeper; RPL34 and RPL21 were the most stable genes ranked by geNorm, and TUB was the most unstable gene identified by all of the three software. The RPL34 gene was used as the reference gene, to detected the expression trend of two starch synthetase genes SS1 and SS2 during germination by RT-qPCR, the results of RT-qPCR and transcriptome sequencing were basically consistent, which verified the stability of RPL34 candidate gene.

    "abstract": "Protein cages are a common architectural motif used by living organisms to compartmentalize and control biochemical reactions. While engineered protein cages have recently been featured in the construction of nanoreactors and synthetic organelles, relatively little is known about the underlying molecular parameters that govern cage stability and molecular flux through their pores. In this work, we systematically designed a 24-member library of protein cage variants based on the T. maritima encapsulin, each featuring pores of different size and charge. Twelve encapsulin pore variants were successfully assembled and purified, including eight designs with exceptional and prolonged thermal stability. While pores lined with negatively charged residues resulted in more robust assemblies than their corresponding positively charged variants, we were able to form stable assemblies covering a full range of pore sizes and charges, as observed in seven new cryo-EM structures of pore variants elucidated at resolutions between 2.5-3.6 [A]. Alongside these structures, molecular dynamics simulations and stopped flow kinetics experiments reveal the importance of considering both pore size and surface charge, together with flexibility and rate determining steps, when designing protein cages for controlling molecular flux.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=176 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/428512v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (70K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@725e76org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@97a497org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b6ea1forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c4d17f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We demonstrated that this effect was mediated by components leaking from nylon.

The phylogenetic placement of this group as a deep-diverging lineage makes acoel embryos an attractive system to study the evolution of major bilaterian traits. Thus far, acoel development has not been described in detail at the morphological and transcriptomic levels in a species where functional genetic studies are possible. Here, we present a set of developmental landmarks for embryogenesis in the highly regenerative acoel Hofstenia miamia. We generated a developmental staging atlas from zygote to hatched worm based on gross morphology, with accompanying bulk transcriptome data for each of the stages. Hofstenia embryos undergo a stereotyped cleavage program known as duet cleavage, which results in two large  macromeres at the vegetal pole and numerous small  micromeres at the animal pole. The macromeres become internalized as micromere progeny proliferate and move vegetally, enveloping the larger blastomeres. We also noted a second, previously undescribed cell internalization event at the animal pole, following which we detected tissues corresponding to all three germ layers. Our work on Hofstenia embryos provides a resource for future investigations of acoel development, which will yield insights into the evolution of development and regeneration.\n\nSummary StatementComprehensive characterization of embryonic development in the acoel worm Hofstenia miamia with accompanying transcriptome data.",

The ion that drives the rotor has changed over evolutionary timescales but the molecular basis of this selectivity remains unknown.\n\nHere we used CRISPR engineering to replace the native Escherichia coli H+-powered stator with Na+-powered stator genes and report the rapid and spontaneous reversion of our edit in a low sodium environment. We followed the evolution of the stators during their reversion to H+-powered motility and used whole genome and transcriptome sequencing to identify both flagellar- and non-flagellar-associated genes involved in the cells adaptation.

    "abstract": "Predicting disease risk in an era of unprecedented biodiversity and climate change is more challenging than ever, largely because when and where hosts are at greatest risk of becoming infected depends on complex relationships between hosts, parasites, and the environment. Theory predicts that host species characterized by fast-paced life-history strategies are more susceptible to infection and contribute more to transmission than their slow-paced counterparts. Hence, disease risk should increase as host community structure becomes increasingly dominated by fast-paced hosts. Theory also suggests that environmental gradients can alter disease risk, both directly, due to abiotic constraints on parasite replication and growth, and indirectly, by changing host community structure. What is more poorly understood, however, is whether environmental gradients can also alter the effect of host community structure on disease risk. We addressed these questions using a detailed survey of host communities and infection severity along a 1100m elevational gradient in southeastern Switzerland. Consistent with prior studies, increasing elevation directly reduced infection severity, which we attribute to abiotic constraints, and indirectly reduced infection severity via changes in host richness, which we attribute to encounter reduction. Communities dominated by fast pace-of-life hosts also experienced more disease. Finally, although elevation did not directly influence host community pace-of-life, the relationship between pace-of-life and disease was sensitive to elevation: increasing elevation weakened the relationship between host community pace-of-life and infection severity. This result provides the first field evidence, to our knowledge, that an environmental gradient can alter the effect of host community structure on infection severity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSocial animals can improve their decisions by attending to the choices made by others. The rewards gained by attending to this social information must be balanced against the costs of obtaining and processing it. Previous work has investigated the behaviour of rational agents that respond optimally to a full sequence of prior decisions. However, such full sequences are potentially difficult to perceive and costly to process. As such, real animals are likely to rely on simpler forms of information when making decisions, which in turn will affect the social behaviour they exhibit. In this paper I derive the optimal policy for rational agents responding to specific simplified forms of social information. I show how the behaviour of agents attending to the total aggregate number of previous choices differs from those attending to more dynamic information provided by the most recent prior decision, and I propose a hybrid strategy that incorporates both information sources to give a highly accurate approximation to the optimal policy with the full sequence. Finally I analyse the evolutionary stability of each strategy depending on the cost of cognition and perception, showing that a hybrid strategy dominates when this cost is low but non-zero, while attending to the most recent decision is dominant when costs are high. These results show that agents can employ highly effective social decision-making rules without requiring unrealistic cognitive capacities, and point to likely ecological variation in the social information different animals attend to.",

    "abstract": "While most genes expression levels are proportional to cell volumes, some genes exhibit nonlinear scaling between their expression levels and cell volume. Therefore, their mRNA and protein concentrations change as the cell volume increases, which often have crucial biological functions such as cell-cycle regulation. However, the biophysical mechanism underlying the nonlinear scaling between gene expression and cell volume is still unclear. In this work, we show that the nonlinear scaling is a direct consequence of the heterogeneous recruitment abilities of promoters to RNA polymerases based on a gene expression model at the whole-cell level. Those genes with weaker (stronger) recruitment abilities than the average ability spontaneously exhibit superlinear (sublinear) scaling with cell volume. Analysis of the promoter sequences and the nonlinear scaling of Saccharomyces cerevisiaes mRNA levels shows that motifs associated with transcription regulation are indeed enriched in genes exhibiting nonlinear scaling, in concert with our model.",

    "abstract": "Optogenetic methods for pacing of cardiac tissue can be realized by direct genetic modification of the cardiomyocytes to express light-sensitive actuators, such as channelrhodopsin-2, ChR2, or by introduction of light-sensitized non-myocytes that couple to the cardiac cells and yield responsiveness to optical pacing. In this study, we engineer three-dimensional \"spark cells\" spheroids, composed of ChR2-expressing human embryonic kidney cells, and characterize their morphology as function of cell density and time. These \"spark-cell\" spheroids are then deployed to demonstrate site-specific optical pacing of human stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) in 96-well format using non-localized light application and all-optical electrophysiology. We show that the spheroids can be handled using liquid pipetting and can confer optical responsiveness of cardiac tissue earlier than direct viral or liposomal genetic modification of the cardiomyocytes, with 24% providing reliable stimulation of the iPSC-CMs within 6 hours and >80% within 24 hours. Our results demonstrate a scalable, cost-effective method to achieve contactless optical stimulation of cardiac cell constructs that can be integrated in a robotics-amenable workflow for high-throughput drug testing.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=180 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/428177v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@156108org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1956092org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f7237eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3b37a4_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic-resistant pathogens constitute an escalating public health concern. Hence a better understanding of the underlying processes responsible for this expansion is urgently needed. Co-selection of heavy metals/biocides and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) has been suggested as one potential mechanism promoting the proliferation of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). This paper aims to elucidate this interplay and exploit differences in antibiotic usage to infer patterns of co-selection by the non-antibiotic factors metals and biocides in the context of pig farming. We examined 278 gut metagenomes from pigs with continuous antibiotic exposure, only at weaning and at no exposure. Metals as growth promoters and biocides as disinfectants are currently used with little restrictions in stock farming. The pigs under continuous antibiotic exposure displayed the highest co-occurrence of ARGs and other genetic elements while the pigs under limited use of antibiotics still showed abundant co-occurrences. Pathogens belonging to Enterobacteriaceae displayed increased co-occurrence phenomena, suggesting that this maintenance is not a random selection process from a mobilized pool but pertains to specific phylogenetic clades. These results suggest that metals and biocides displayed strong selective pressures on ARGs exerted by intensive farming, regardless of the current use of antibiotics.\n\nHighlightsO_LIA comprehensive gut microbiome metagenomics analysis of 278 pigs\nC_LIO_LICo-selection phenomena were investigated via co-occurrence patterns as a proxy\nC_LIO_LITwenty-seven types of co-occurrences involving 131 resistance genes were detected\nC_LIO_LIRegardless of use of antibiotics, AMR can be maintained by co-occurrence with MRGs/BRGs\nC_LIO_LIMaintenance of AMR is not a random selection process but pertains to specific phylogenetic clades\nC_LI",

Seq-Scope is based on a solid-phase amplification of randomly barcoded single-molecule oligonucleotides using an Illumina sequencing-by-synthesis platform. The resulting clusters annotated with spatial coordinates are processed to expose RNA-capture moiety. These RNA-capturing barcoded clusters define the pixels of Seq-Scope that are approximately 0.5-1 m apart from each other. From tissue sections, Seq-Scope visualizes spatial transcriptome heterogeneity at multiple histological scales, including tissue zonation according to the portal-central (liver), crypt-surface (colon) and inflammation-fibrosis (injured liver) axes, cellular components including single cell types and subtypes, and subcellular architectures of nucleus, cytoplasm and mitochondria. Seq-scope is quick, straightforward and easy-to-implement, and makes spatial single cell analysis accessible to a wide group of biomedical researchers.",

    "abstract": "Nearly all organisms interact with multiple mutualists, and complementarity within these complex interactions can result in synergistic fitness effects. However, it remains largely untested how multiple mutualists impact eco-evolutionary dynamics. We tested how multiple microbial mutualists-- N-fixing bacteria and mycorrrhizal fungi-- affected selection and heritability in their shared host plant (Medicago truncatula), as well as fitness alignment between partners. Our results demonstrate for the first time that multispecies mutualisms synergistically affect selection and heritability of host traits and enhance fitness alignment between mutualists. Specifically, we found that multiple mutualists doubled the strength of selection on a plant architectural trait, resulted in 2-3-fold higher heritability of reproductive success, and more than doubled the strength of fitness alignment between N-fixing bacteria and plants. Taken together, these findings show that synergism generated by multiple mutualisms extends to key components of microevolutionary change, and emphasizes the importance of multiple mutualist effects in understanding evolutionary trajectories.",

    "abstract": "Filoviridae family members Ebola (EBOV) and Marburg (MARV) viruses and Arenaviridae family member Lassa virus (LASV) are emerging pathogens that can cause hemorrhagic fever and high rates of mortality in humans. A better understanding of the interplay between these viruses and the host will inform about the biology of these pathogens, and may lead to the identification of new targets for therapeutic development. Notably, expression of the filovirus VP40 and LASV Z matrix proteins alone drives assembly and egress of virus-like particles (VLPs). The conserved PPxY Late (L) domain motifs in the filovirus VP40 and LASV Z proteins play a key role in the budding process by mediating interactions with select host WW-domain containing proteins that then regulate virus egress and spread. To identify the full complement of host WW-domain interactors, we utilized WT and PPxY mutant peptides from EBOV and MARV VP40 and LASV Z proteins to screen an array of GST-WW-domain fusion proteins. We identified WW domain-containing oxidoreductase (WWOX) as a novel PPxY-dependent interactor, and we went on to show that full-length WWOX physically interacts with eVP40, mVP40 and LASV Z to negatively regulate egress of VLPs and of a live VSV/Ebola recombinant virus (M40). Interestingly, WWOX is a versatile host protein that regulates multiple signaling pathways and cellular processes via modular interactions between its WW-domains and PPxY motifs of select interacting partners, including host angiomotin (AMOT). Notably, we demonstrated recently that expression of endogenous AMOT not only positively regulates egress of VLPs, but also promotes egress and spread of live EBOV and MARV. Toward the mechanism of action, we show that the competitive and modular interplay among WWOX-AMOT-VP40/Z regulates VLP and M40 virus egress. Thus, WWOX is the newest member of an emerging group of host WW-domain interactors (e.g. BAG3; YAP/TAZ) that negatively regulate viral egress. These findings further highlight the complex interplay of virus-host PPxY/WW-domain interactions and their potential impact on the biology of both the virus and the host during infection.\n\nAuthor SummaryFiloviruses (Ebola [EBOV] and Marburg [MARV]) and arenavirus (Lassa virus; LASV) are zoonotic, emerging pathogens that cause outbreaks of severe hemorrhagic fever in humans. A fundamental understanding of the virus-host interface is critical for understanding the biology of these viruses and for developing future strategies for therapeutic intervention. Here, we identified host WW-domain containing protein WWOX as a novel interactor with VP40 and Z, and showed that WWOX inhibited budding of VP40/Z virus-like particles (VLPs) and live virus in a PPxY/WW-domain dependent manner. Our findings are important to the field as they expand the repertoire of host interactors found to regulate PPxY-mediated budding of RNA viruses, and further highlight the competitive interplay and modular virus-host interactions that impact both the virus lifecycle and the host cell.",

    "abstract": "How cognitive task behavior is generated by brain network interactions is a central question in neuroscience. Answering this question calls for the development of novel analysis tools that can firstly capture neural signatures of task information with high spatial and temporal precision (the \"where and when\"), and then allow for empirical testing of alternative network models of brain function that link information to behavior (the \"how\"). We outline a novel network modeling approach suited to this purpose that is applied to non-invasive functional neuroimaging data in humans. We first dynamically decoded the spatiotemporal signatures of task information in the human brain by combining MRI-individualized source electroencephalography with multivariate pattern analysis. A newly developed network modeling approach - dynamic activity flow modeling - then simulated the flow of task-evoked activity over more causally interpretable (relative to standard functional connectivity approaches) resting-state functional connections (dynamic, lagged, direct and directional). We demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach by applying it to elucidate network processes underlying sensory-motor information flow in the brain, revealing accurate predictions of empirical response information dynamics underlying behavior. Extending the model towards simulating network lesions suggested a role for the cognitive control networks (CCNs) as primary drivers of response information flow, transitioning from early dorsal attention network-dominated sensory-to-response transformation to later collaborative CCN engagement during response selection. These results demonstrate the utility of the dynamic activity flow modeling approach in identifying the generative network processes underlying neurocognitive phenomena.",

The local approach, contrary to existing global methods, provides spatial information on anatomical patterns of brain ageing. We trained a U-Net model using brain MRI scans from n=3463 healthy people (aged 18-90 years) to produce individualised 3D maps of brain-predicted age. When testing on n=692 healthy people, we found a median (across participant) mean absolute error (within participant) of 9.5 years. Performance was more accurate (MAE around 7 years) in the prefrontal cortex and periventricular areas. We also introduce a new voxelwise method to reduce the age-bias when predicting local brain-age \"gaps\". To validate local brain-age predictions, we tested the model in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia using data from OASIS3 (n=267). Different local brain-age patterns were evident between healthy controls and people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia, particularly in subcortical regions such as the accumbens, putamen, pallidum, hippocampus and amygdala. Comparing groups based on mean local brain-age over regions-of-interest resulted in large effects sizes, with Cohens d values >1.5, for example when comparing people with stable and progressive mild cognitive impairment. Our local brain-age framework has the potential to provide spatial information leading to a more mechanistic understanding of individual differences in patterns of brain ageing in health and disease.",

Here we develop a tractable method of describing the effect of positive selection on the genealogical histories in the surrounding genome, explicitly modeling both the timing and context of the adaptive event. In addition, our framework allows us to go beyond simple polymorphism data. We are able to leverage information contained in patterns of linked variants, and even with very small sample sizes, our analytic framework has high power to identify historically adaptive regions of the genome and to correctly infer both the time and strength of selection. Finally, we derived the marginal distribution of genealogical branch lengths at a locus affected by selection acting at a linked site. This provides a much-needed link between current theoretical models to recent advances in simulation procedures that have allowed researchers both to examine the evolution of genealogical histories at the level of full chromosomes and build methods that attempt to reconstruct full ancestries from genome sequence data.",

Protective levels of OspA antibodies in pups were present from 2-5 weeks after birth and they persisted in some mice until 9 weeks of age. This was corroborated by detection of neutralizing antibodies in the serum of all pups at 2-3 weeks after birth and in some mice at 9 weeks of age.

    "abstract": "The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) demands unprecedented attention. We report four X-ray crystal structures of three synthetic nanobodies (sybodies) (Sb16, Sb45 and Sb68) bind to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2: binary complexes of Sb16-RBD and Sb45-RBD; a ternary complex of Sb45-RBD-Sb68; and Sb16 unliganded. Sb16 and Sb45 bind the RBD at the ACE2 interface, positioning their CDR2 and CDR3 loops diametrically. Sb16 reveals a large CDR2 shift when binding the RBD. Sb68 interacts peripherally at the ACE2 interface; steric clashes with glycans explain its mechanism of viral neutralization. Superposing these structures onto trimeric spike (S) protein models indicates these sybodies bind conformations of the mature S protein differently, which may aid therapeutic design.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryX-ray structures of synthetic nanobodies complexed with the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 reveal details of CDR loop interactions in recognition of distinct epitopic sites.",

    "abstract": "Endochondral ossification forms and grows the majority of the mammalian skeleton and is tightly controlled through gene regulatory networks. The forkhead box transcription factors Foxc1 and Foxc2 have been demonstrated to regulate aspects of osteoblast function in the formation of the skeleton but their roles in chondrocytes to control endochondral ossification are less clear. We demonstrate that Foxc1 expression is directly regulated by SOX9 activity, one of the earliest transcription factors to specify the chondrocyte lineages. Moreover we demonstrate that elevelated expression of Foxc1 promotes chondrocyte differentiation in mouse embryonic stem cells and loss of Foxc1 function inhibits chondrogenesis in vitro. Using chondrocyte-targeted deletion of Foxc1 and Foxc2 in mice, we reveal a role for these factors in chondrocyte differentiation in vivo. Loss of both Foxc1 and Foxc2 caused a general skeletal dysplasia predominantly affecting the vertebral column. The long bones of the limb were smaller and mineralization was reduced and organization of the growth plate was disrupted. In particular, the stacked columnar organization of the proliferative chondrocyte layer was reduced in size and cell proliferation in growth plate chondrocytes was reduced. Differential gene expression analysis indicated disrupted expression patterns in chondrogenesis and ossification genes throughout the entire process of endochondral ossification in Col2-cre;Foxc1{Delta}/{Delta};Foxc2{Delta}/{Delta} embryos. Our results suggest that Foxc1 and Foxc2 are required for correct chondrocyte differentiation and function. Loss of both genes results in disorganization of the growth plate, reduced chondrocyte proliferation and delays in chondrocyte hypertrophy that prevents correct ossification of the endochondral skeleton.",

    "abstract": "Cell therapy as a promising therapeutic modality to treat cancer has been intensively studied for decades. However, the clinical trials have indicated that patients under T cell therapy may develop severe cytokine release syndrome resulting in hospitalization or even death. Furthermore, genetic modifications to promote proliferation and persistence of T cells could result in high numbers of long-lived engineered cells in patients after treatment. In this study we developed a novel tBID-based safety switch regulated through a small molecule inducible on switch to control undesired toxicity or ablate engineered cells as needed. We compared several tBID-based safety switch constructs with the clinically validated safety switches, HSV-TK (human herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase) and iCasp9 (inducible Caspase 9), few tBID-based safety switch constructs were systematically tested and investigated in vitro in Jurkat or human primary T cells. We demonstrated that our novel tBID based safety switch, with optimization, was able to eliminate up to ~90% of transduced human primary T cells within 72hr after activation, providing an alternative switch system to manage safety concerns for cell therapy.",

    "abstract": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common and deadly disease, and patients with metastatic tumors often fail to respond to therapy. While select members of the microbiome are associated with improved anti-tumor immunity, mechanistic understanding of how the microbiome provides a benefit is lacking. We show that modification of the CRC-associated microbiome with a single immunogenic commensal bacteria can alter T cell differentiation, inhibit tumor growth, and increase survival. Microbiome-driven control of CRC required the formation of colonic tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) and increased infiltration of the tumor with cytotoxic immune cells. In the context of CRC, CD4+ T cells specific to the newly introduced commensals differentiated into T follicular helper cells and were necessary for the formation of TLS, immune infiltration of the tumor, and control over CRC. Thus, modification of the intestinal T cell response by the microbiome can be used to augment anti-tumor immunity in colorectal cancer.",

    "abstract": "Oncogenic fusions represent compelling druggable targets in solid tumours highlighted by the recent site agnostic FDA approval of larotrectinib for NTRK rearrangements. However screening for fusions in routinely processed tissue samples is constrained due to degradation of nucleic acid as a result of formalin fixation., To investigate the clinical utility of semiconductor sequencing optimised for detection of actionable fusion transcripts in formalin fixed samples, we have undertaken an analysis of test trending data generated by a clinically validated next generation sequencing platform designed to capture 867 of the most clinically relevant druggable driver-partner oncogenic fusions. Here we showacross a real-life cohort of 1112 patients with solid tumours that actionable fusions occur at high frequency (7.4%) with linkage to a wide range of targeted therapy protocols including seven fusion-drug matches with FDA/EMA approval and/or NCCN/ESMO recommendations and 80 clinical trials. The majority of actionable fusions identified were independent of tumour type in keeping with signalling via evolutionary conserved Wnt/{beta}-catenin, RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK, PI3K/AKT/MTOR, PLCy/PKC and JAK/STAT pathways. Taken together our data indicates that semiconductor sequencing for detection of actionable fusions can be integrated into routine diagnostic pathology workflows enabling the identification of personalised treatment options that have potential to improve clinical cancer management across many tumour types.",

    "abstract": "Increased autophagy and lysosomal activity promote tumor growth, survival and chemo-resistance. During acute starvation, autophagy is rapidly engaged by AMPK activation and mTORC1 inhibition to maintain energy homeostasis and cell survival. TFEB and TFE3 are master transcriptional regulators of autophagy and lysosomal activity and their cytoplasm/nuclear shuttling is controlled by mTORC1-dependent multisite phosphorylation. However, it is not known whether and how the transcriptional activity of TFEB or TFE3 is regulated. We show that AMPK mediates phosphorylation of TFEB and TFE3 on three serine residues, leading to TFEB/TFE3 transcriptional activity upon nutrient starvation, FLCN depletion and pharmacological manipulation of mTORC1 or AMPK. AMPK loss does not affect TFEB/TFE3 nuclear localization nor protein levels but reduces their transcriptional activity. Collectively, we show that mTORC1 specifically controls TFEB/TFE3 cytosolic retention whereas AMPK is essential for TFEB/TFE3 transcriptional activity. This dual and opposing regulation of TFEB/TFE3 by mTORC1 and AMPK is reminiscent of the regulation of another critical regulator of autophagy, ULK1. Surprisingly, we show that chemoresistance is mediated by AMPK-dependent activation of TFEB, which is abolished by pharmacological inhibition of AMPK or mutation of serine 466/467/469 to alanine residues within TFEB. Altogether, we show that AMPK is a key regulator of TFEB/TFE3 transcriptional activity, and we validate AMPK as a promising target in cancer therapy to evade chemotherapeutic resistance.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can affect performance by decreasing regional excitability in a brain region that contributes to the task of interest. To our knowledge, no research to date has found both enhancing and diminishing effects on performance, depending upon which polarity of current is applied. The supramarginal gyrus (SMG) is an ideal brain region for testing tDCS effects because it is easy to identify using the 10-20 EEG coordinate system, and results of neuroimaging studies have implicated the left SMG in short-term memory for phonological and non-phonological sounds. In the present study, we found that applying tDCS to the left SMG affected pitch memory in a manner that depended upon the polarity of stimulation: cathodal tDCS had a negative impact on performance while anodal tDCS had a positive impact. These effects were significantly different from sham stimulation, which did not influence performance; they were also specific to the left hemisphere - no effect was found when applying cathodal stimulation to the right SMG - and were unique to pitch memory as opposed to memory for visual shapes. Our results provide further evidence that the left SMG is a nodal point for short-term auditory storage and demonstrate the potential of tDCS to influence cognitive performance, and to causally examine hypotheses derived from neuroimaging studies.",

We used a massively parallel reporter assay (MPRA) to identify HARs with enhancer activity in a mammalian testis cell line. A subset of HARs exhibited differential activity between the human and chimpanzee orthologs, representing candidates for underlying unique human male reproductive biology. We further characterized one of these candidate testis enhancers, 2xHAR.238. CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deletion in a testis cell line and mice revealed that 2xHAR.238 enhances expression of Gli2, encoding a Hedgehog pathway effector, in testis Leydig cells. 4C-seq revealed that 2xHAR.238 contacts the Gli2 promoter, consistent with enhancer function. In adult male mice, deletion of 2xHAR.238 disrupted mouse male-typical behavior and male interest in female odor. Combined, our work identifies a HAR that promotes the expression of Gli2 in Leydig cells and may have contributed to the evolution of human male reproductive biology.",

    "abstract": "The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway monitors translation termination to degrade transcripts with premature stop codons and regulate thousands of human genes. Here we show that an alternative mammalian-specific isoform of the core NMD factor UPF1, termed UPF1LL, enables condition-dependent remodeling of NMD specificity. Previous studies indicate that the extension of a conserved regulatory loop in the UPF1LL helicase core confers a decreased propensity to dissociate from RNA upon ATP hydrolysis relative to the major UPF1 isoform, designated UPF1 SL. Using biochemical and transcriptome-wide approaches, we find that UPF1LL overcomes the protective RNA binding proteins PTBP1 and hnRNP L to preferentially bind and down-regulate long 3UTRs normally shielded from NMD. Unexpectedly, UPF1LL supports induction of NMD on new populations of substrate mRNAs in response to activation of the integrated stress response and impaired translation efficiency. Thus, while canonical NMD is abolished by moderate translational repression, UPF1LL activity is enhanced, providing a mechanism to rapidly rewire NMD specificity in response to cellular stress.",
