    "abstract": "Dispersal is fundamental to life on our planet. Dispersal facilitates colonization of continents and islands. Dispersal mediates gene flow among populations, and influences the rate of spread of invasive species. Theory suggests that individuals consistently differ in dispersal propensity, however determining the relative contributions of environmental factors to individual and population-level dispersal, represent a major challenge to understand the spread of organisms. To address this, we conducted a field experiment using Drosophila melanogaster. As proxies for individuals with different dispersal propensities, we used wildtype strains of flies with natural variants of the foraging gene, known to influence dispersal in laboratory and field experiments. These included flies with fors alleles known to be less dispersive, flies with the forR alleles which are more dispersive flies as well as an outbred population established from field collected flies. We released approximately 6000 flies of each strain in an experimental arena (100 m x 100 m) in the field and our recaptures were used to determine dispersal of flies over time. To estimate environmental effects on dispersal, we measured temperature, wind direction and wind speed. Using partial-differential equations we combined ecological diffusion with advection to estimate dispersal rates and responses to wind. We found that temperature effects elicited a similar response in high and low dispersal lab strains with dispersal rate increasing with temperature most rapidly at temperatures above 18{degrees}C. This was in contrast to outbred flies which remained unresponsive to temperature changes. We also detected a response to wind with advection rates increasing linearly with wind speed for all flies in general. Our results suggest that response to temperature and wind can minimize known differences in behavioural predispositions to disperse. Our results also suggest that the direction and magnitude of wind may play a key role in the colonization and distribution of fly populations. Our findings therefore have implications for forecasting the spread of pests and invasive species as well as pathogens and vectors of disease. Our findings further contribute to the understanding of how the environment can modify behavioural predispositions and to influence population-level dispersal in fly populations in particular and insect species in general.",

    "abstract": "MotivationMultiple studies have shown the utility of transcriptome-wide RNA-seq profiles as features for machine learning-based prediction of response to chemotherapy in cancer. While tumor transcriptome profiles are publicly available for thousands of tumors for many cancer types, a relatively modest number of tumor profiles are clinically annotated for response to chemotherapy. The paucity of labeled examples and high dimension of the feature data limit performance for predicting therapeutic response using fully-supervised classification methods. Recently, multiple studies have established the utility of a deep neural network approach, the variational autoencoder (VAE), for generating meaningful latent features from original data. Here, we report first study of a semi-supervised approach using VAE-encoded tumor transcriptome features and regularized gradient boosted decision trees (XGBoost) to predict chemotherapy drug response for five cancer types: colon adenocarcinoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, bladder carcinoma, sarcoma, and breast invasive carcinoma.\n\nResultsWe found: (1) VAE-encoding of the tumor transcriptome preserves the cancer type identity of the tumor, suggesting preservation of biologically relevant information; and (2) as a feature-set for supervised classification to predict response-to-chemotherapy, the unsupervised VAE encoding of the tumors gene expression profile leads to better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) classification performance than either the original gene expression profile or the PCA principal components of the gene expression profile, in four out of five cancer types that we tested.\n\nAvailabilitygithub.com/ATHED/VAE_for_chemotherapy_drug_response_prediction\n\nContactramseyst@oregonstate.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "DNA barcoding and metabarcoding are now widely used to advance species discovery and biodiversity assessments. High-throughput sequencing (HTS) has expanded the volume and scope of these analyses, but elevated error rates introduce noise into sequence records that can inflate estimates of biodiversity. Denoising --the separation of biological signal from instrument (technical) noise--of barcode and metabarcode data currently employs abundance-based methods which do not capitalize on the highly conserved structure of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) region employed as the animal barcode. This manuscript introduces debar, an R package that utilizes a profile hidden Markov model to denoise indel errors in COI sequences introduced by instrument error. In silico studies demonstrated that debar recognized 95% of artificially introduced indels in COI sequences. When applied to real-world data, debar reduced indel errors in circular consensus sequences obtained with the Sequel platform by 75%, and those generated on the Ion Torrent S5 by 94%. The false correction rate was less than 0.1%, indicating that debar is receptive to the majority of true COI variation in the animal kingdom. In conclusion, the debar package improves DNA barcode and metabarcode workflows by aiding the generation of more accurate sequences aiding the characterization of species diversity.",

    "abstract": "Systemic treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) targets the tumor microenvironment (TME) by combining immunotherapy with angiogenesis inhibitors. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) are important components of the TME, however their targeting in clinics remains challenging. To this end, the existence of tumor supressing CAF and their poor characterisation is a major conundrum. Starting from proteomics and single cell analysis, we outline CAF heterogeneity in HCC and describe a subtype of CAF that express a novel tumor-related protein prolargin. Upon secretion prolargin is deposited in the TME where its levels positively correlate with patient outcome (HR=0.37; p=0.01). In vivo, tumors with lower prolargin expression display faster progression (5-fold; p=0.01) and stronger angiogenesis. Mechanistically, aggressive HCC cells degrade prolargin using matrix metalloprotease 3 (MMP3). We show that prolargin binds and inhibits several growth factors, key to tumor progression. Inhibiting prolargin degradation combined with sorafenib, demonstrated superior tumor control compared to sorafenib treatment alone. In conclusion, prolargin-expressing CAF have tumor-antagonizing properties. Stabilizing prolargin tumoral levels should be considered for systemic therapy of HCC, involving CAF in existing TME targeting.",

Witness trees from the regions first GLO surveys (General Land Office), which preceded settlement, are used to reconstruct the composition, character, and distribution of the regions natural forests. As such, this investigation augments a similar study of early forests around Puget Sound, situated immediately to the north (Schroeder, 2019). A retrospective species map is constructed from locational information from more than thirty-five thousand witness trees; accompanying tree diameters elucidate size differences by species and geographic locales. Three principal forest types were noted: western hemlock in the rainy western hills, with some Sitka spruce near the coast; Douglas-fir with woodland tree species in the rain-shadowed central plains; and hemlock/Douglas-fir/redcedar mixtures on the lower flanks of the Cascade Range. Although the majority of trees were small or medium in size, a significant fraction was large. All forest types displayed significant amounts of old growth, as judged by screening witness trees against a quantitative model. Mensuration exercises estimate that the regions pre-settlement tree population approached one-half billion specimens with a timber volume of nearly 50 billion cubic feet.",

To improve this situation, we developed an inexpensive worm tracking system for use by high school interns and undergraduate students. Over the past two years this tracker has been successfully used by undergraduate students in our introductory Cell and Molecular lab (BSC220) at Illinois State University.

    "abstract": "The study of RNA modifications, today known as epitranscriptomics, is of growing interest. The N6-methyladenosine (m6A) and 5-methylcytosine (m5C) RNA modifications are abundantly present on mRNA molecules, and impact RNA interactions with other proteins or molecules, thereby affecting cellular processes, such as RNA splicing, export, stability and translation. Recently m6A and m5C marks were found to be present on human immunodeficiency (HIV) transcripts as well and affect viral replication. Therefore, the discovery of RNA methylation provides a new layer of regulation of HIV expression and replication, and thus offers novel array of opportunities to inhibit replication. However, no study has been performed to date to investigate the impact of HIV replication on the transcript methylation level in the infected cell. We used a productive HIV infection model, consisting of the CD4+ SupT1 T cell line infected with a VSV-G pseudotyped HIVeGFP-based vector, to explore the temporal landscape of m6A and m5C epitranscriptomic marks upon HIV infection, and compare it to mock-treated cells. Cells were collected at 12, 24 and 36h post-infection for mRNA extraction and FACS analysis. M6A RNA modifications were investigated by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (MeRIP-Seq). M5C RNA modifications were investigated using a bisulfite conversion approach followed by high-throughput sequencing (BS-Seq).\n\nOur data suggest that HIV Infection impacted the methylation landscape of HIV-infected cells, inducing mostly increased methylation of cellular transcripts upon infection. Indeed, differential methylation (DM) analysis identified 59 m6A hypermethylated and only 2 hypomethylated transcripts and 14 m5C hypermethylated transcripts and 7 hypomethylated ones. All data and analyses are also freely accessible on an interactive web resource (http://sib-pc17.unil.ch/HIVmain.html). Furthermore, both m6A and m5C methylations were detected on viral transcripts and viral particle RNA genomes, as previously described, but additional patterns were identified.\n\nThis work used differential epitranscriptomic analysis to identify novel players involved in HIV life cycle, thereby providing innovative opportunities for HIV regulation.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of artemisinin (ART) resistance in Plasmodium falciparum parasites has led to increasing rates of treatment failure with first-line ART-based combination therapies (ACTs) in Southeast Asia. In this region, select mutations in K13 can result in delayed parasite clearance rates in vivo and enhanced survival in the ring-stage survival assay (RSA) in vitro. Our genotyping of 3,299 P. falciparum isolates across 11 sub-Saharan countries reveals the continuing dominance of wild-type K13 and confirms the emergence of a K13 R561H variant in Rwanda. Using gene editing, we provide definitive evidence that this mutation, along with M579I and C580Y, can confer variable degrees of in vitro ART resistance in African P. falciparum strains. C580Y and M579I were both associated with substantial fitness costs in African parasites, which may counter-select against their dissemination in high-transmission settings. We also report the impact of multiple K13 mutations, including the predominant variant C580Y, on RSA survival rates and fitness in multiple Southeast Asian strains. No change in ART susceptibility was observed upon editing point mutations in ferrodoxin or mdr2, earlier associated with ART resistance in Southeast Asia. These data point to the lack of an evident biological barrier to mutant K13 mediating ART resistance in Africa, while identifying their detrimental impact on parasite growth.",

    "abstract": "Rv3737 is the sole homologue of multifunctional transporter ThrE in Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether this transporter participates in vitro and in vivo survival of Mtb. To characterize the role of Rv3737, we constructed and characterized an Mtb H37Rv{Delta}Rv3737. This strain was evaluated for altered growth rate and macrophage survival using cell model of infection. In addition, the comparative analysis was conducted to determine the association between Rv3737 mRNA expression and disease severity in active pulmonary TB patients. The H37Rv{Delta}Rv3737 strain exhibited significant slow growth rate compared to H37Rv-WT strain in standard culture medium. Additionally, the survival rate of H37Rv-WT strain in macrophages was 2 folds higher than that of H37Rv{Delta}Rv3737 at 72 h. A significant higher level of TNF- and IL-6 mRNA expression was observed in macrophages infected with H37Rv{Delta}Rv3737 as compared to H37Rv-WT. Of note, Rv3737 expression was significantly increased in clinical Mtb isolates than H37Rv-WT. The relative expression level of Rv3737 was positively correlated with lung cavity number in TB patients. Similarly, the higher Rv3737 mRNA level resulted in lower C(t) value by Xpert MTB/RIF assay, demonstrating that a positive correlation between Rv3737 expression and bacterial load in TB patients. In conclusion, our data is the first to demonstrate that the transporter Rv3737 is required for in vitro growth and survival of bacteria inside macrophages. In addition, the expression level of Rv3737 is associated with bacterial load and disease severity in pulmonary tuberculosis patients.",

We developed a surface biotinylation protocol to purify and quantify both bacterial and host proteins present on the surface of diarrheal fluid-derived V. cholerae. We found that SP-D, a toxin-dependent host protein that directly binds the V. cholerae surface, is a novel intestinal defense factor. Other V. cholerae-bound host proteins also bound distinct taxa of the murine intestinal microbiota.

MEF of type Ube1L-/- are composed of two distinct sub-populations, the strong type that sustains a strong viral infection and the weak type, sustaining a weak viral load. We present new data on the virus load infection of Ube1L-/-, which have been micro-printed in a checker board pattern of different sizes of the inner squares. Surprisingly, the total viral load at one day after inoculation significantly depends on the sizes of the inner squares. We explain this observation by using a reaction diffusion model and we show that mathematical homogenization can explain the observed inhomogeneities. If the individual patches are large, then the growth rate and the carrying capacity will be the arithmetic means of the patches. For finer and finer patches the average growth rate is still the arithmetic mean, however, the carrying capacity uses the harmonic mean. While fitting the PDE to the experimental data, we also predict that a discrepancy in virus load would be unobservable after only half a day. Furthermore, we predict the viral load in different inner squares that had not been measured in our experiment and the travelling distance the virions can reach after one day.",

    "abstract": "Histone H3K4me1 and H3K27ac are enhancer specific modifications and are required for enhancers to activate transcription of target genes. However the reciprocal effects of these histone modifications on each other and their roles in enhancers are not clear. Here to comparatively analyze the role of these modifications, we inhibited H3K4me1 and H3K27ac by deleting SET domain of histone methyltransferases MLL3 and MLL4 and HAT domain of histone acetyltransferase p300, respectively, in erythroid K562 cells. The loss of H3K4me1 reduced H3K27ac at the {beta}-globin enhancer LCR HSs, but H3K27ac reduction did not affect H3K4me1. This unequal relationship between two modifications was revealed in putative enhancers by genome-wide analysis using ChIP-seq. Histone H3 depletion at putative enhancers was weakened by the loss of H3K4me1 but not by the loss of H3K27ac. Chromatin remodeling complexes were recruited into the {beta}-globin LCR HSs in a H3K4me1-dependent manner. In contrast, H3K27ac was required for enhancer RNA (eRNA) transcription, and H3K4me1 was not enough for it. Forced H3K27ac induced eRNA transcription without affecting H3K4me1 at the {beta}-globin LCR HSs. These results indicate that H3K4me1 and H3K27ac affect each other in different ways and play more direct roles in nucleosome depletion and eRNA transcription, respectively, at enhancers.",

Recently, an emergent SARS-CoV-2 variant (B.1.1.7) with an unusually large number of mutations had become highly contagious and wide-spreading in United Kingdom. From genome analysis, the N501Y mutation within the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2s spike protein might have enhanced the viral proteins binding with the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2). The latter is the prelude for the virus entry into host cells. So far, the molecular mechanism of this enhanced binding is still elusive, which prevents us from assessing its effects on existing therapeutic antibodies. Using all atom molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrated that Y501 in mutated RBD can be well coordinated by Y41 and K353 in hACE2 through hydrophobic interactions, increasing the overall binding affinity between RBD and hACE2 by about 0.81 kcal/mol. We further explored how the N501Y mutation might affect the binding between a neutralizing antibody (CB6) and RBD. We expect that our work can help researchers design proper measures responding to this urgent virus mutation, such as adding a modified/new neutralizing antibody specifically targeting at this variant in the therapeutic antibody cocktail.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=121 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/425316v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (40K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1231e91org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@abf67dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1c3a288org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e3ab52_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "A recent and powerful technique is to obtain transcriptomes from rare cell populations, such as single neurons in C. elegans, by enriching dissociated cells using fluorescent sorting. However, these cell samples often have low yields of RNA that present challenges in library preparation. This can lead to PCR duplicates, noisy gene expression for lowly expressed genes, and other issues that limit endpoint analysis. Further, some common resources, such as sequence specific kits for removing ribosomal RNA, are not optimized for non-mammalian samples. To optimize library construction for such challenging samples, we compared two approaches for building RNAseq libraries from less than 10 nanograms of C. elegans RNA: SMARTSeq V4 (Takara), a widely used kit for selecting poly-adenylated transcripts; and SoLo Ovation (Tecan Genomics), a newly developed ribodepletion-based approach. For ribodepletion, we used a custom kit of 200 probes designed to match C. elegans rRNA gene sequences. We found that SoLo Ovation, in combination with our custom C. elegans probe set for rRNA depletion, detects an expanded set of noncoding RNAs, shows reduced noise in lowly expressed genes, and more accurately counts expression of long genes. The approach described here should be broadly useful for similar efforts to analyze transcriptomics when RNA is limiting.",

    "abstract": "Halogenation is a recurring feature in natural products, especially those from marine organisms. The selectivity with which halogenating enzymes act on their substrates renders halogenases interesting targets for biocatalyst development. Recently, CylC - the first predicted dimetal-carboxylate halogenase to be characterized - was shown to regio- and stereoselectively install a chlorine atom onto an unactivated carbon center during cylindrocyclophane biosynthesis. Homologs of CylC are also found in other characterized cyanobacterial secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters. Due to its novelty in biological catalysis, selectivity and ability to perform C-H activation, this halogenase class is of considerable fundamental and applied interest. However, little is known regarding the diversity and distribution of these enzymes in bacteria. In this study, we used both genome mining and PCR-based screening to explore the genetic diversity and distribution of CylC homologs. While we found non-cyanobacterial homologs of these enzymes to be rare, we identified a large number of genes encoding CylC-like enzymes in publicly available cyanobacterial genomes and in our in-house culture collection of cyanobacteria. Genes encoding CylC homologs are widely distributed throughout the cyanobacterial tree of life, within biosynthetic gene clusters of distinct architectures. Their genomic contexts feature a variety of biosynthetic partners, including fatty-acid activation enzymes, type I or type III polyketide synthases, dialkylresorcinol-generating enzymes, monooxygenases or Rieske proteins. Our study also reveals that dimetal-carboxylate halogenases are among the most abundant types of halogenating enzymes in the phylum Cyanobacteria. This work will help to guide the search for new halogenating biocatalysts and natural product scaffolds.\n\nData statementAll supporting data and methods have been provided within the article or through a Supplementary Material file, which includes 14 supplementary figures and 4 supplementary tables.",

In this study, we developed a 192-tandem-microwell-based high-throughput-assay for ammonia that is a known virulence factor of H. pylori and a product of urease. We could identify few drugs, i.e. panobinostat, dacinostat, ebselen, captan and disulfiram, to potently inhibit the activity of ureases from bacterial or plant species. These inhibitors suppress the activity of urease via substrate-competitive or covalent-allosteric mechanism, but all except captan prevent the antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strain from infecting human gastric cells, with a more pronounced effect than acetohydroxamic acid, a well-known urease inhibitor and clinically used drug for the treatment of bacterial infection. This study offers several bases for the development of new treatments for urease-containing pathogens and to study the mechanism responsible for the regulation of urease activity.",

    "abstract": "The ability of S-glycoprotein (S-protein) in SARS-Cov-2 to bind to the host cell receptor protein (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)) leading to its entry in the cellular system determines its contagious index and global spread. Three available drugs (Riboflavin, Amodiaquin dihydrochloride dihydrate (ADD), and Remidesivir) were investigated to understand the kinetics of S-protein and its entry inside a cellular environment. Optical microscopy and fluorescence-based assays on 293T cells (transfected with ACE2 plasmid) were used as the preamble for assessing the behavior of S-protein in the presence of these drugs for the first 12 hours post-S-protein - ACE2 binding. Preliminary results suggest relatively long retention of S-protein on the cell membrane in the presence of ADD drug. Evident from the %-overlap and colocalization of S-protein with endosome studies, a significant fraction of S-protein entering the cell escape endosomal degradation process, suggesting S-protein takes non-endocytic mediated entry in the presence of ADD. In contrast, in the presence of Riboflavin, S-protein carries out a normal endocytic pathway, comparable to the control (no drug) group. Therefore, the present study indicates ADD potentially affects S-proteins entry mechanism (endocytic pathway) in addition to its reported target action mechanism. Hence, ADD substantially interferes with S-protein cellular entrance mechanism. This is further strengthened by 24 hrs study. However, detailed studies at the molecular scale are necessary to clarify our understanding of exact intermediate molecular processes. The present study (based on limited data) reveals ADD could be a potential candidate to manage Covid-19 functions through the yet unknown molecular mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Histological analysis of teeth can yield information on an organisms growth and development, facilitating investigations of diet, health, environment, and long-term responses to selective pressures. In the Americas, an extraordinary abundance of Late Pleistocene fossils including teeth has been preserved in petroleum seeps, constituting a major source of information about biotic changes and adaptations at the end of the last glacial period. However, the usefulness of these fossils for histological studies is unclear, due to the unknown taphonomic effects of long-term deposition in petroleum. Here, we compare histological and chemical analyses on dire wolf (Canis dirus) teeth obtained from two different environments, i.e. a petroleum seep (Rancho La Brea tar pits, California) and a carstic sinkhole (Cutler Hammock sinkhole, Florida). Optical and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) together with X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed excellent preservation of dental microstructure in the seep sample, and the petroleum-induced discoloration was found not to interfere with the histological and chemical examination. By comparison, teeth from the sinkhole sample showed severe degradation and contamination of the dentine by exogenous substances. These results indicate that petroleum seep assemblages are useful, or even ideal, environments for preserving the integrity of fossil material for chemical and histological analysis.",

To promote high-quality science communication, we participated in a local science festival, both providing information about the brain and ASD and asking passersby questions about their knowledge of ASD. We then asked the booth staffers to evaluate the program and conducted qualitative analyses of public and staffer responses. Public responses to the question \"what would you like to know about autism?\" most often concerned how the disorder was diagnosed or defined. In contrast, public responses to the question \"what would you like others to know about autism?\" centered around educating those unaffected by ASD on how to improve interactions and awareness, mentioning inclusivity and intersectionality, and dispelling negative stereotypes. The staffers overwhelmingly reported that in future years, they would include even more science and allow for more in-depth conversations with interested parties, as well as bringing materials in other languages. These responses are in keeping with a trend for more inclusive science communication, particularly in the field of behavioral health and ASD, and a desire to challenge myths around the condition. We conclude that our science festival interactions brought multiple benefits to public and staff.",

    "abstract": "Only one classical MHC-I locus (aka DLA-88) evolved in dogs, and thus far, a total of 76 DLA-88 alleles can be divided into two categories. The first category consists of 60 alleles, and the second category consists of 16 alleles. The main difference between the two categories is the insertion of an amino acid in the 2 region of DLA-88 alleles. To elucidate the structure of the first category, in this study, the crystal structure of pDLA-88*001:01 was determined for the first time. The 3D structure and topological characteristics of the ABG of pDLA-88*001:01 with a CDV peptide were analyzed. The viral presentation profile and the binding motif of viruses presented by pDLA-88*001:01 were determined. Most importantly, there were no amino acid insertions in the 2 region of the first category, which changed the conformation of the D pocket and the docking of the TCR. The results suggest obvious differences between the two categories. Because of the variation in the 2 region, pDLA-88*001:01 showed distinctive features in the two categories. Due to the peptide-binding motif of pDLA-88*001:01, more than 320 high-affinity viral peptides were predicted from dog H7N9, CPV, CMV, CMV, and CDV strains. The results reveal that there are two kinds of structural MHC-I systems in dogs that are responsible for CTL immunity against viral diseases. The results provide knowledge for designing viral epitope vaccines in canines.\n\nImportanceDLA plays an important role in the acquired immunity of organism. In previous study, the pMHC-I structure of dog was analyzed with DLA-88 self-peptide. In this study, we screened several viral peptides which can bind to DLA-88 and resolved the structure of the DLA-88 complex binding the CDV peptide. This study enriches the study of canine MHC-I molecular-presenting polypeptide-activated TCR, which is of great significance for the study of canine cellular immunity and anti-viral vaccine development.",

In comparison to the well-studied T. brucei, there is a major paucity of knowledge regarding the biology of T. congolense. Here, we use a combination of omics technologies and novel genetic tools to characterise core metabolism in T. congolense mammalian-infective bloodstream-form parasites, and test whether metabolic differences compared to T. brucei impact upon drug sensitivity. Like T. brucei, glycolysis plays a major part in T. congolense energy metabolism. However, the rate of glucose uptake is significantly reduced in T. congolense, with cells remaining viable when cultured in concentrations as low as 2 mM. Instead of pyruvate, the primary glycolytic endpoints are succinate, malate and acetate. Comparative transcriptomics analysis showed higher levels of activity associated with the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, acetate generation and the succinate shunt in T. congolense. However, based on omics analysis and chemical inhibition, there does not appear to be significant levels of oxidative phosphorylation. Stable-isotope labelling of glucose enabled the comparison of carbon usage between T. brucei and T. congolense, highlighting differences in nucleotide and fatty acid metabolism. To validate the metabolic similarities and differences, both species were treated with pharmacological inhibitors, confirming a lack of essential electron transport chain activity in T. congolense, but increased sensitivity to inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate import. Strikingly, T. congolense exhibited significant resistance to inhibitors of fatty acid synthesis, including a 780-fold greater EC50 against the lipase and fatty acid synthase inhibitor Orlistat, compared to T. brucei. These data highlight that bloodstream form T. congolense diverges from T. brucei in key areas of metabolism, with several features that are intermediate between bloodstream- and insect-stage T. brucei. These results have implications for drug development, mechanisms of drug resistance and host-pathogen interactions.",

However, only few Chloroflexi members have been cultivated, hampering further understanding of this important group. In the current study, we firstly clarify the high abundance of the phylum Chloroflexi in deep-sea sediments via the operational taxonomic units analysis. We further successfully isolate a novel Chloroflexi strain ZRK33 from cold seep sediments by using an enrichment medium constantly supplemented with rifampicin. Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene, genome, RpoB and EF-tu proteins indicate that strain ZRK33 represents a novel class, and the class is designated as Sulfochloroflexia because whole set of genes encoding key enzymes responsible for assimilatory sulfate reduction are identified in the genome of strain ZRK33. Indeed, assimilation of sulfate or thiosulfate by strain ZRK33 evidently benefits its growth and morphogenesis. Proteomic results suggest that metabolization of sulfate or thiosulfate significantly promotes the transport and degradation of various macromolecules and thereby stimulating the energy production. Notably, the putative genes associated with assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction ubiquitously distribute in the metagenome-assembled genomes of 27 Chloroflexi members derived from deep-sea sediments, strongly suggesting that Chloroflexi bacteria play undocumented key roles in deep-sea sulfur cycling.",

Organosulfur metabolism and biologically-derived hydrogen sulfide play dynamic roles in manifestation of diseases, infrastructure degradation, and essential biological processes.

Here we report the discovery of 39 gene families involved in organosulfur metabolism encoded by 3,749 viruses from diverse ecosystems, including human microbiomes. The viruses infect organisms from all three domains of life. Six gene families encode for enzymes that degrade organosulfur compounds into sulfide, while others manipulate organosulfur compounds and may influence sulfide production. We show that viral metabolic genes encode key enzymatic domains, are translated into protein, are maintained after recombination, and that sulfide provides a fitness advantage to viruses.

    "abstract": "Parasites of the genus Amoebophrya sp. are important contributors to marine ecosystems and can be determining factors in the demise of blooms of Dinophyceae, including microalgae commonly responsible for toxic red tides. Yet they rarely lead to the total collapse of Dinophyceae blooms. The addition of resistant Dinophyceae (Alexandrium minutum or Scrippsiella donghaienis) or their exudate into a well-established host-parasite culture (Scrippsiella acuminata-Amoebophrya sp.) mitigated the success of the parasite and increased the survival of the sensitive host. Effect were mediated via water-borne molecules without the need of a physical contact. Severity of the anti-parasitic defenses fluctuated depending on the species, the strain and its concentration, but never totally prevented the parasite transmission. The survival time of Amoebophrya sp. free-living stages (dinospores) decreased in presence of A. minutum but not of S. donghaienis. The progeny drastically decreased with both species. Integrity of the membrane of dinospores was altered by A. minutum which provided a first indication on the mode of action of these anti-parasitic molecules. These results demonstrate that extracellular defenses are an effective strategy against parasites that does not only protect the resistant cells but also have the potential to affect the whole surrounding community.",

    "abstract": "The MS ring is a part of the flagellar basal body and formed by 34 subunits of FliF, which consists of a large periplasmic region and two transmembrane segments connected to the N- and C-terminal regions facing the cytoplasm. A cytoplasmic protein, FlhF, which determines the position and number of the basal body, supports MS ring formation in the membrane. In this study, we constructed FliF deletion mutants that lack 30 or 50 residues at the N-terminus ({Delta}N30 and {Delta}N50), and 83 ({Delta}C83) or 110 residues ({Delta}C110) at the C-terminus. The N-terminal deletions were functional and conferred motility of Vibrio cells, whereas the C-terminal deletions were nonfunctional. The mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli to determine whether an MS ring could still be assembled. When co-expressing {Delta}N30FliF or {Delta}N50FliF with FlhF, fewer MS rings were observed than with the expression of wild-type FliF, in the MS ring fraction, suggesting that the N-terminus interacts with FlhF. MS ring formation is probably inefficient without an additional factor or FlhF. The deletion of the C-terminal cytoplasmic region did not affect the ability of FliF to form an MS ring because a similar number of MS rings were observed for {Delta}C83FliF as with wild-type FliF, although further deletion of the second transmembrane segment ({Delta}C110FliF) abolished it. These results suggest that the terminal regions of FliF have distinct roles; the N-terminal region for efficient MS ring formation and the C-terminal region for MS ring function. The second transmembrane segment is indispensable for MS ring assembly.\n\nImportanceThe bacterial flagellum is a supramolecular architecture involved in cell motility. At the base of the flagella, a rotary motor that begins to construct an MS ring in the cytoplasmic membrane comprises 34 transmembrane proteins (FliF). Here, we investigated the roles of the N and C terminal regions of FliF, which are MS rings. Unexpectedly, the cytoplasmic regions of FliF are not indispensable for the formation of the MS ring, but the N-terminus appears to assist in ring formation through recruitment of FlhF, which is essential for flagellar formation. The C-terminus is essential for motor formation or function.",

    "abstract": "Single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled transcriptome-wide profiling of gene expressions in individual cells. A myriad of computational methods have been proposed to learn cell-cell similarities and/or cluster cells, however, high variability and dropout rate inherent in scRNA-seq confounds reliable quantification of cell-cell associations based on the gene expression profile alone. Lately bioinformatics studies have emerged to capture key transcriptome information on alternative polyadenylation (APA) from standard scRNA-seq and revealed APA dynamics among cell types, suggesting the possibility of discerning cell identities with the APA profile. Complementary information at both layers of APA isoforms and genes creates great potential to develop cost-efficient approaches to dissect cell types based on multiple modalities derived from existing scRNA-seq data without changing experimental technologies. We proposed a toolkit called scLAPA for learning association for single-cell transcriptomics by combing single-cell profiling of gene expression and alternative polyadenylation derived from the same scRNA-seq data. We compared scLAPA with seven similarity metrics and five clustering methods using diverse scRNA-seq datasets. Comparative results showed that scLAPA is more effective and robust for learning cell-cell similarities and clustering cell types than competing methods. Moreover, with scLAPA we found two hidden subpopulations of peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were undetectable using the gene expression data alone. As a comprehensive toolkit, scLAPA provides a unique strategy to learn cell-cell associations, improve cell type clustering and discover novel cell types by augmentation of gene expression profiles with polyadenylation information, which can be incorporated in most existing scRNA-seq pipelines. scLAPA is available at https://github.com/BMILAB/scLAPA.",

    "abstract": "3D analysis of skeletal volumes has become an important field in digital anthropology studies. The volume of the mastoid process has been proposed to display significant sexual dimorphism, but it has a complex shape and to date no study has quantified the full mastoid volume for sex estimation purposes. In this study we compared three different ways to isolate the volume of the mastoid process from digital 3D models of dry crania, and then evaluated the performance of the three different volume definitions for sex estimation purposes. A total of 170 crania (86 male, 84 females) excavated from five medieval Croatian sites were CT-scanned and used to produce 3D stereolitographic models. The three different isolation techniques were based on various anatomical landmarks and planes, as well as the anatomy of the mastoid process itself. Measurements of the three different mastoid volumes yielded different accuracies and precisions. Interestingly, anatomical structures were sometimes more useful than classical landmarks as demarcators of mastoid volume. For all three volume definitions, male mastoid volumes were significantly larger than female volumes, in both relative and absolute numbers. Sex estimation based on mastoid volume showed a slightly higher precision and better accuracy (71 % correct classifications) than visual scoring techniques (67 %) and linear distance measurements (69 %) of the mastoid process. Sex estimation based on cranial size performed even better (78 %), and multifactorial analysis (skull size + mastoid volume) reached up to 81% accuracy. These results show that measurements of the mastoid volume represent a promising metric to be used in multifactorial approaches for sex estimation of human remains.",

We leveraged this approach to study sex-specific and -common connectivity patterns in schizophrenia.\n\nResults show dynamic reconfiguration and interaction within and between multi-spatial scales. Sex-specific differences occur (1) within the subcortical domain, (2) between the somatomotor and cerebellum domains, and (3) between the temporal domain and several others, including the subcortical, visual, and default mode domains. Most of the sex-specific differences belong to between-spatial scale functional interactions and are associated with a dynamic state with strong functional interactions between the visual, somatomotor, and temporal domains and their anticorrelation patterns with the rest of the brain. We observed significant correlations between multi-spatial scale functional interactions and symptom scores, highlighting the importance of multiscale analyses to identify potential biomarkers for schizophrenia. As such, we recommend such analyses as an important option for future functional connectivity studies.",

Neutrophils are the most abundant leukocyte, express FcRI, and are often the first to respond to sites of injury and infection. Here, we describe a novel function for IgA:virus immune complexes (ICs) during viral infections. We show that IgA:virus ICs potentiate NETosis - the programmed cell death pathway through which neutrophils release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Mechanistically, IgA:virus ICs potentiated a suicidal NETosis pathway via engagement of FcRI on neutrophils through a toll-like receptor (TLR)-independent, NADPH oxidase complex-dependent pathway. NETs also were capable of trapping and inactivating viruses, consistent with an antiviral function.",

There is currently no fully effective treatment for cryptosporidiosis, which has stimulated interest in anticryptosporidial development over the last [~]10 years with numerous lead compounds identified including several tRNA synthetase inhibitors. In this study, we report the results of a dairy calf efficacy trial of the methionyl-tRNA (CpMetRS) synthetase inhibitor 2093 and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Dairy calves experimentally infected with Cryptosporidium parvum initially improved with 2093 treatment, but parasite shedding resumed in two of three calves on treatment day five. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had different amino acid altering CpMetRS mutations, coding either an aspartate 243 to glutamate (D243E) or a threonine 246 to isoleucine (T246I) mutation. Transgenic parasites engineered to have either the D243E or T246I CpMetRS mutation using CRISPR/Cas9 grew normally but were highly 2093 resistant; the D243E and T246I mutant expressing parasites respectively had 2093 EC50S of 613- or 128-fold that of transgenic parasites with wild-type CpMetRS. In studies using recombinant enzymes, the D243E and T246I mutations shifted the 2093 IC50 by >170-fold. Structural modeling of CpMetRS based on an inhibitor-bound Trypanosoma brucei MetRS crystal structure suggested that the resistance mutations reposition nearby hydrophobic residues, interfering with compound binding while minimally impacting substrate binding. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance, highlighting the need to address the potential for anticryptosporidial resistance and establish strategies to limit its occurrence.\n\nImportanceCryptosporidium is a leading protozoan cause of diarrhea in young children with no reliable treatment. We report results of a dairy calf drug efficacy trial and the spontaneous emergence of drug resistance. Cryptosporidium parvum infected calves initially improved with drug treatment, but infection relapsed in two animals. Parasites shed by each recrudescent calf had mutations in the gene encoding the drug target that altered its amino acid sequence. Recapitulation of the drug target mutations by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing resulted in highly drug-resistant parasites, and recombinant mutant enzymes were resistant to inhibition. This is the first report of naturally emerging Cryptosporidium drug resistance.

    "abstract": "Beyond their canonical function in nucleocytoplasmic exchanges, nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) regulate the expression of protein-coding genes. Here, we have implemented transcriptomic and molecular methods to specifically address the impact of the NPC on retroelements, which are present in multiple copies in genomes. We report a novel function for the Nup84 complex, a core NPC building block, in specifically restricting the transcription of LTR-retrotransposons in yeast. Nup84 complex-dependent repression impacts both Copia and Gypsy Ty LTR-retrotransposons, all over the S. cerevisiae genome. Mechanistically, the Nup84 complex restricts the transcription of Ty1, the most active yeast retrotransposon, through the tethering of the SUMO-deconjugating enzyme Ulp1 to NPCs. Strikingly, the modest accumulation of Ty1 RNAs caused by Nup84 complex loss-of-function is sufficient to trigger an important increase of Ty1 cDNA levels, resulting in massive Ty1 retrotransposition. Altogether, our studies expand our understanding of the complex interactions between retrotransposons and the NPC, and highlight the importance for the cells to keep retrotransposon under tight transcriptional control.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYRetroelements, which replicate by reverse transcription of their RNA into a cDNA that is integrated into the host genetic material, play an important role in the plasticity of eukaryotic genomes. The study of yeast retrotransposons has led to the identification of host factors that limit retroelement mobility, including components of the nuclear pore complex (NPC), most of them still awaiting mechanistic characterization. Here, we investigated the contribution of the Nup84 complex, a core NPC scaffold, to retrotransposon biology in budding yeast. Our findings uncover that the Nup84 complex restricts the transcription of phylogenetically-distinct Ty retroelements. By focusing on Ty1 retrotransposons, we provide evidence that repression by the Nup84 complex depends on the maintenance at the NPC of the SUMO-protease Ulp1, an essential enzyme of the SUMO pathway with multiple targets in the transcription machinery. We finally show that this transcriptional control is critical for genome dynamics, since a small increase in the accumulation of Ty1 RNAs leads to massive retrotransposition. Our data reveal that although relatively abundant, Ty transcripts are limiting for retrotransposition, underscoring the importance of a tight control of their expression. They also characterize a new non-canonical function of NPCs, confirming their connection with genome expression and stability.",

    "abstract": "MotivationComplex biological tissues are often a heterogeneous mixture of several molecularly distinct cell or tissue subtypes. Both subtype compositions and expressions in individual samples can vary across different biological states or conditions. Computational deconvolution aims to dissect patterns of bulk gene expression data into subtype compositions and subtype-specific expressions. Typically, existing deconvolution methods can only estimate averaged subtype-specific expressions in a population, while detecting differential expressions or co-expression networks in particular subtypes requires unique subtype expression estimates in individual samples. Different from population-level deconvolution, however, individual-level deconvolution is mathematically an underdetermined problem because there are more variables than observations.\n\nResultsWe report a sample-wise Convex Analysis of Mixtures (swCAM) method that can estimate subtype proportions and subtype-specific expressions in individual samples from bulk tissue transcriptomes. We extend our previous CAM framework to include a new term accounting for between-sample variations and formulate swCAM as a nuclear-norm and{ell} 2,1-norm regularized matrix factorization problem. We determine hyperparameter values using a cross-validation scheme with random entry exclusion and obtain a swCAM solution using an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers. The swCAM is implemented in open-source R scripts. Experimental results on realistic simulation data show that swCAM can accurately estimate subtype-specific expressions in individual samples and successfully extract co-expression networks in particular subtypes that are otherwise unobtainable using bulk expression data. Application of swCAM to bulk-tissue data of 320 samples from bipolar disorder patients and controls identified changes in cell proportions, expression and coexpression modules in patient neurons. Mitochondria related genes showed significant changes suggesting an important role of energy dysregulation in bipolar disorder.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe R Scripts of swCAM is freely available at https://github.com/Lululuella/swCAM.

    "abstract": "Theories of perception based on discrete sampling posit that visual consciousness is reconstructed based on snapshot-like perceptual moments, as opposed to being updated continuously. According to a model proposed by Schneider (2018), discrete sampling can explain both the flash-lag and the Frohlich illusion, whereby a lag in the conscious updating of a moving stimulus alters its perceived spatial location in comparison to a stationary stimulus. The alpha-band frequency, which is associated with phasic modulation of stimulus detection and the temporal resolution of perception, has been proposed to reflect the duration of perceptual moments. The goal of this study was to determine whether a single oscillator (e.g., alpha) is underlying the duration of perceptual moments, which would predict that the point of subjective equality (PSE) in the flash-lag and Frohlich illusions are positively correlated across individuals. Although our displays induced robust flash-lag and Frohlich effects, virtually zero correlation was seen between the PSE in the two illusions, indicating that the illusion magnitudes are unrelated across observers. These findings suggest that, if discrete sampling theory is true, these illusory percepts either rely on different oscillatory frequencies or not on oscillations at all. Alternatively, discrete sampling may not be the mechanism underlying these two motion illusions or our methods were ill-suited to test the theory.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular space (ECS) plays a central role for brain physiology, shaping the time course and spread of neurochemicals, ions and nutrients that ensure proper brain homeostasis and neuronal communication. Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glia cell in the brain, whose processes densely infiltrate the brains parenchyma. As astrocytes are highly sensitive to changes in osmotic pressure, they are capable of exerting a potent physiological influence on the ECS.\n\nHowever, little is known about the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of the ECS that surrounds astrocytes, owing mostly to a lack of appropriate techniques to visualize the ECS in live brain tissue. Mitigating this technical limitation, we applied the recent SUper-resolution SHadow Imaging technique (SUSHI) to astrocyte-labeled organotypic hippocampal brain slices, which allowed us to concurrently image the complex morphology of astrocytes and the ECS with nanoscale resolution in a live experimental setting.\n\nFocusing on ring-like astrocytic microstructures in the spongiform domain, we found them to enclose sizable pools of interstitial fluid and cellular structures like dendritic spines. Upon an experimental osmotic challenge, these microstructures remodeled and swelled up at the expense of the pools, effectively increasing the physical contact between astrocytic and cellular structures.\n\nOur study reveals novel facets of the dynamic microanatomical relationships between astrocytes, neuropil and the ECS in living brain tissue, which could be of functional relevance for neuronglia communication in a variety of (patho)physiological settings, e.g. LTP induction, epileptic seizures or acute ischemic stroke, where osmotic disturbances are known to occur.",

    "abstract": "The concept of test-retest reliability indexes the consistency of a measurement across time. High reliability is critical for any scientific study, but specifically for the study of individual differences. Evidence of poor reliability of commonly used behavioral and functional neuroimaging tasks is mounting. Reports on low reliability of task-based fMRI have called into question the adequacy of using even the most common, well-characterized cognitive tasks with robust population-level effects, to measure individual differences. Here, we lay out a hierarchical framework that estimates reliability as a correlation divorced from trial-level variability, and show that reliability estimates tend to be higher compared to the conventional framework that adopts condition-level modeling and ignores across-trial variability. We examine how estimates from the two frameworks diverge and assess how different factors (e.g., trial and subject sample sizes, relative magnitude of cross-trial variability) impact reliability estimates. We also show that, under specific circumstances, the two statistical frameworks converge. Results from the two approaches are approximately equivalent if (a) the trial sample size is sufficiently large, or (b) cross-trial variability is in the same order of magnitude as, or less than, cross-subject variability. As empirical data indicate that cross-trial variability is large in most tasks, this work highlights that a large number of trials (e.g., greater than 100) may be required to achieve precise reliability estimates. We reference the tools TRR and 3dLMEr for the community to apply trial-level models to behavior and neuroimaging data and discuss how to make these new measurements most useful for current studies.",

    "abstract": "ImportanceStructural brain maturation and sleep are complex processes that exhibit significant changes over adolescence and are linked to healthy physical and mental development. The precise timing and magnitude of these changes influence function throughout the lifespan. However, the relationships between gray matter structure and sleep patterns during adolescence are not fully understood. A detailed characterization of brain-sleep associations during this sensitive period is crucial for understanding factors contributing to optimal neurodevelopmental trajectories in adolescence.\n\nObjectiveTo investigate whether sleep-gray matter relationships are developmentally-invariant (i.e., stable across age) or developmentally-specific (i.e., only present during discrete time windows) from late childhood through young adulthood.\n\nSettingThe Neuroimaging and Pediatric Sleep Databank was constructed from 8 research studies conducted at the University of Pittsburgh between 2009 and 2020.\n\nParticipantsThe final sample consisted of 240 participants without current psychiatric diagnoses (9-25 years), and with good quality sleep tracking and structural MRI (sMRI) data.\n\nDesignParticipants completed a sMRI scan and 5-7 days of wrist actigraphy to assess naturalistic sleep. We examined cross-sectional associations between sMRI measures and sleep patterns, as well as the effects of age, sex, and their interaction with sMRI measures on sleep.\n\nMain Outcome(s) and Measure(s)Using Freesurfer software, we extracted cortical thickness and subcortical volumes from T1-weighted MRI. Sleep patterns (duration, timing, continuity, regularity) were estimated from wrist actigraphy.\n\nResultsShorter sleep duration, later sleep timing, and poorer sleep continuity were associated with a stable pattern of thinner cortex and altered subcortical volumes in diverse brain regions across adolescence. In a discrete subset of regions (e.g., posterior cingulate), thinner cortex was associated with these sleep patterns from late childhood through early-to-mid adolescence, but not in late adolescence and young adulthood.\n\nConclusions and RelevanceIn childhood and adolescence, developmentally-invariant and developmentally-specific associations exist between sleep patterns and gray matter structure, in a wide array of brain regions linked to many sensory, cognitive, and emotional processes. Sleep intervention during specific developmental periods could potentially promote healthier neurodevelopmental outcomes.\n\nKEY POINTSO_ST_ABSQuestionC_ST_ABSDoes age modulate associations between gray matter structure and actigraphic sleep patterns across adolescent development?\n\nFindingsThis cross-sectional study reports stable associations between regional gray matter structure and shorter duration, later timing, and poorer continuity of sleep from ages 9 to 25 years-old, as well as developmentally-specific associations that are present only from late childhood to early-to-mid adolescence.\n\nMeaningStronger coupling of gray matter and sleep patterns from late childhood to early-to-mid adolescence potentially implicates this discrete developmental window as a period of vulnerability to adverse sleep-brain interactions. Sleep intervention during this developmental stage may support healthier neurodevelopmental trajectories.",

    "abstract": "OBJECTIVEA key event in atherogenesis is the formation of lipid-loaded macrophages, lipidotic cells, which exhibit irreversible accumulation of undigested modified low-density lipoproteins in lysosomes. This event culminates with the loss of cell homeostasis, inflammation and cell death. In this study we propose to identify the chemical etiological factors and understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the impairment of lysosome function in macrophages.\n\nAPPROACH AND RESULTSUsing shotgun lipidomics we have discovered that a family of oxidized lipids (cholesteryl hemiesters, ChE), end products of oxidation of polyunsaturated cholesteryl esters, occurs at higher concentrations in the plasma of two cohorts of cardiovascular disease patients than in the plasma of a control cohort. Macrophages exposed to the most prevalent ChE, cholesteryl hemiazelate (ChA) exhibit lysosome enlargement, peripheral lysosomal positioning, lysosome dysfunction and lipidosis which are irreversible. The transcriptomic profile of macrophages exposed to ChA indicates that the lysosome pathway is deeply affected and is well correlated with lysosome phenotypic and functional changes. Interestingly, the dysfunctional peripheral lysosomes are more prone to fuse with the plasma membrane, secreting their undigested luminal content into the extracellular milieu with potential consequences to the pathology.\n\nCONCLUSIONWe identify ChA not only as one of the molecules involved in the etiology of irreversible lysosome dysfunction culminating with lipidosis but also as a promoter of exocytosis of the dysfunctional lysosomes. The latter event is a new mechanism that may be important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

    "abstract": "Climate change has ecosystem-wide cascading effects. Little is known, however, about the resilience of Arctic marine ecosystems to environmental change. Here we quantify and compare large-scale patterns in rocky intertidal biomass, coverage and zonation in six regions along a north-south gradient of temperature and ice conditions in West Greenland (60-72{degrees}N). We related the level and variation in assemblage composition, biomass and coverage to latitudinal-scale environmental drivers. Across all latitudes, the intertidal assemblage was dominated by a core of stress-tolerant foundation species that constituted >95% of the biomass. Hence, canopy-forming macroalgae, represented by Fucus distichus subsp. evanescens and F. vesiculosus and, up to 69 {degrees}N, also Ascophyllum nodosum, together with Semibalanus balanoides, occupied >70% of the vertical tidal range in all regions. Thus, a similar functional assemblage composition occurred across regions, and no latitudinal depression was observed. The most conspicuous difference in species composition from south to north was that three common species (the macroalgae Ascophyllum nodosum, the amphipod Gammarus setosus and the gastropod Littorina obtusata) disappeared from the mid-intertidal, although at different latitudes. There were no significant relationships between assemblage metrics and air temperature or sea ice coverage as obtained from weather stations and satellites, respectively. Although the mean biomass decreased >50% from south to north, local biomass in excess of 10 000 g ww m-2 was found even at the northernmost site, demonstrating the patchiness of this habitat and the effect of small-scale variation in environmental characteristics. Hence, using the latitudinal gradient in a space-for-time substitution, our results suggest that while climate modification may lead to an overall increase in the intertidal biomass in north Greenland, it is unlikely to drive dramatic functional changes in ecosystem structure in the near future. Our dataset provides an important baseline for future studies to verify these predictions for Greenlands intertidal zone.",

    "abstract": "Sansevierias are a diverse group of flowering plants native to Africa, Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula and the Indian subcontinent, popular outside their native range as low maintenance houseplants. Traditionally recognized as a distinct genus, Sansevieria was recently merged with the larger genus Dracaena based on molecular phylogenetic data. Within the Sansevieria clade, taxonomic uncertainties remain despite numerous attempts to classify the species. We aim to arrive at a robust phylogeny using a plastid phylogenomic approach, and estimate a time-frame of diversification to infer the evolutionary history of the group, including geographical and morphological evolution. Molecular data was obtained using genome skimming for 50 Sansevieria, representing all informal groups previously instated based on morphology, and two Dracaena sensu stricto species. The resulting Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic hypotheses are generally well supported, except for some very short branches along the backbone of the tree. The time-calibrated phylogeny indicates a recent rapid radiation with the main clades emerging in the Pliocene. Two well-supported clades align with previously defined informal groups, i.e., Sansevieria section Dracomima, characterised by the Dracomima-type inflorescence, and the Zeylanica group, native to the Indian subcontinent. Other morphologically defined informal groups are shown to be polyphyletic: a pattern due to convergent evolution of the identifying characters. Cylindrical leaves arose multiple times independently in the evolution of the Sansevieria clade and similarly, the Cephalantha-type inflorescence has originated multiple times from an ancestor with a Sansevieria-type inflorescence. To provide a more accessible tool for species identification and delimitation, genes and spacer regions were screened for variability and phylogenetic informativeness to investigate their potential as chloroplast DNA barcodes. Candidate chloroplast DNA barcodes include the trnH-rpl12, ndhH-rps15, psbE-petL, psbT-psbN, rps18-rpl20 intergenic spacers, the chloroplast gene rps8 and the first intron of ycf3.",

    "abstract": "AbstractRNA structure plays a crucial role in the replication of positive sense RNA viruses and can form functional elements within the untranslated regions (UTRs) and the protein coding sequences (or open reading frames (ORFs)). While RNA structures in the UTRs of several picornaviruses have been functionally characterised, the roles of putative RNA structures predicted for the ORF remain largely undefined. Here we have undertaken a bioinformatic analysis of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome and predicted the existence of 53 evolutionarily conserved RNA structures within the ORF. Forty-five (45) of these structures were located in the regions encoding the non-structural proteins (nsps). To investigate if the structures in the regions encoding the nsps are required for FMDV replication we used a mutagenesis method, CDLR mapping, where sequential coding segments were shuffled to minimise RNA secondary structures while preserving protein coding, native dinucleotide frequencies and codon usage. To examine the impact of these changes on replicative fitness, mutated sequences were inserted into an FMDV sub-genomic replicon. We found that three of the RNA structures, all at the 3 termini of the FMDV ORF, were critical for replicon replication. Contrastingly, disruption of the other 42 conserved RNA structures that lie within the regions encoding the nsps had no effect on replicon replication, suggesting that these structures are not required for initiating translation or replication of viral RNA. Conserved RNA structures that are not essential for virus replication could provide ideal targets for the rational attenuation of a wide range of FMDV strains.\n\nImportanceSome RNA structures formed by the genomes of RNA viruses are critical for viral replication. Our study shows that of 45 conserved RNA structures located within the regions of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome that encode the non-structural proteins, only three are essential for replication of an FMDV sub-genomic replicon. Replicons replication is dependent on RNA translation and synthesis; thus, our results suggest that the three RNA structures are critical for either initiation of viral RNA translation and/or viral RNA synthesis. Although further studies are required to identify if the remaining 42 RNA structures have other roles in virus replication, they may provide targets for the rational large-scale attenuation of a wide range of FMDV strains. FMDV causes a highly contagious disease posing a constant threat to global livestock industries. Such weakened FMDV strains could be investigated as live-attenuated vaccines or could enhance biosecurity of conventional inactivated vaccine production.",

Defining their interactomes in human cardiac progenitors via affinity purification-mass spectrometry and integrating results with genetic data from the Pediatric Cardiac Genomic Consortium revealed an enrichment of de novo variants among proteins that interact with GATA4 or TBX5. A consolidative score that prioritized interactome members based on variant, gene, and proband features identified likely CHD-causing genes, including the epigenetic reader GLYR1. GLYR1 and GATA4 widely co-occupied cardiac developmental genes, resulting in co-activation, and the GLYR1 missense variant associated with CHD disrupted interaction with GATA4.

    "abstract": "Despite high prevalence and high heritability, few candidate genes have been identified for reading disability. To identify novel genetic variants we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using high-depth whole genome sequencing and predicated on reading performance in 407 subjects enrolled in a longitudinal study of response-to-intervention, called the New Haven Lexinome Project. The primary GWAS identified a single peak of 31 SNPs on chromosome 19 that achieved the threshold for genome-wide significance (rs2599553 P=3.13x10-8) located over an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) for GARRE1 (Granule Associated Rac And RHOG Effector 1). Little is known about the function of GARRE1, except that it is highly and developmentally expressed in human cerebellum relative to cortex. Local ancestry regression showed the strongest association for the lead variant in African or Admixed American populations, who have been under-represented in previous genetic studies of reading. We replicated our chromosome 19 results in the Genes, Reading, and Dyslexia (GRaD) cohort and found a moderating effect of age with implications for the consideration of developmental effects in the design of future analyses. Growth curve modeling demonstrated that minor alleles of the lead SNP are related to reading longitudinally from Grade 1 to Grade 5, and that children with at least 1 minor allele of rs2599553 persistently underperformed relative to their peers by 0.33 to 0.5 standard deviations on standardized assessments of non-word decoding and reading fluency.\n\nSignificance StatementTo the best of our knowledge, this work represents the only GWAS predicated on longitudinal reading performance data. Starting with initial discovery, we replicate our association in a second cohort, address common causes of type I error, localize the signal to a single gene, implicate a region of the brain most likely to be affected by variation in our candidate, show a gene-by-age effect with implications for study design in this field, and demonstrate that minor alleles of our lead SNP are associated with significant and persistent clinical effects on reading development in children.",

    "abstract": "The MYC oncogene encodes for the c-Myc protein and is frequently dysregulated across multiple cancer cell types, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. There have been many difficulties in targeting c-Myc, due to its complex network of regulators and the unstructured nature of its protein. Thus, we are interested in looking at the downstream cancer-specific functions of c-Myc. Overexpression of MYC leads to c-Myc binding at active enhancers, resulting in a global transcriptional amplification of active genes. However, the mechanism underlying this c-Myc enhancer invasion has not been well studied. To that end, we performed ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, 4C-seq and SIQHiC (Spike-in Quantitative Hi-C) on the U2OS osteosarcoma cell line with tetracycline-inducible MYC. MYC overexpression in U2OS cells modulated histone acetylation and increased c-Myc binding at superenhancers. SIQHiC analysis revealed increased global chromatin contact frequency, particularly at chromatin interactions connecting c-Myc binding sites. Our results suggest that c-Myc molecules are recruited to and accumulates within zones of high transcription activity, binding first at stable promoter binding sites at low expression levels, then at superenhancer binding sites when overexpressed. At the same time, the recruitment of c-Myc and other transcription factors may stabilize chromatin interactions to increase chromatin contact frequency. The accumulation of c-Myc at cancer-type specific superenhancers may then drive the expression of interacting oncogenes that each cancer is highly reliant on. By elucidating the chromatin landscape of c-Myc driven cancers, we can potentially target these chromatin interactions for cancer therapy, without affecting physiological c-Myc signaling.",

    "abstract": "Much hope in drug development comes from the discovery of positive allosteric modulators (PAM) that display target subtype selectivity, and act by increasing agonist potency and efficacy. How such compounds can allosterically influence agonist action remains unclear. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGlu) are G protein-coupled receptors that represent promising targets for brain diseases, and for which PAMs acting in the transmembrane domain have been developed. Here, we explore the effect of a PAM on the structural dynamics of mGlu2 in optimized detergent micelles using single molecule FRET at submillisecond timescales. We show that glutamate only partially stabilizes the extracellular domains in the active state. Full activation is only observed in the presence of a PAM or the Gi protein. Our results provide important insights on the role of allosteric modulators in mGlu activation, by stabilizing the active state of a receptor that is otherwise rapidly oscillating between active and inactive states.",

    "abstract": "Many living cells actively migrate in their environment to perform key biological functions - from unicellular organisms looking for food to single cells such as fibroblasts, leukocytes or cancer cells that can shape, patrol or invade tissues. Cell migration results from complex intracellular processes that enable cell self-propulsion 1,2, and has been shown to also integrate various chemical or physical extracellular signals 3,4,5. While it is established that cells can modify their environment by depositing biochemical signals or mechanically remodeling the extracellular matrix, the impact of such self-induced environmental perturbations on cell trajectories at various scales remains unexplored. Here, we show that cells remember their path: by confining cells on 1D and 2D micropatterned surfaces, we demonstrate that motile cells leave long-lived physicochemical footprints along their way, which determine their future path. On this basis, we argue that cell trajectories belong to the general class of self-interacting random walks, and show that self-interactions can rule large scale exploration by inducing long-lived ageing, subdiffusion and anomalous first-passage statistics. Altogether, our joint experimental and theoretical approach points to a generic coupling between motile cells and their environment, which endows cells with a spatial memory of their path and can dramatically change their space exploration.",

    "abstract": "The binaural system utilizes interaural timing cues to improve the detection of auditory signals presented in noise. In humans, the binaural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon cannot be directly measured - and hence remain contentious. As an alternative, we trained modified autoencoder networks to mimic human-like behavior in a binaural detection task. The autoencoder architecture emphasizes interpretability and, hence, we \"opened it up\" to see if it could infer latent mechanisms underlying binaural detection. We found that the optimal network automatically developed artificial neurons with sensitivity to timing cues and with dynamics consistent with a cross-correlation mechanism. These computations were similar to neural dynamics reported in animal models. That these computations emerged to account for human hearing attests to their generality as a solution for binaural signal detection. Methodologically, the study examines the utility of explanatory-driven neural networks and how they may be used to infer mechanisms of audition.",

    "abstract": "Behavioral studies have shown that humans account for inertial acceleration in their decisions of hand choice when reaching during body motion. Physiologically, it is unclear at what stage of movement preparation information about body motion is integrated in the process of hand selection. Here, we addressed this question by applying transcranial magnetic stimulation over motor cortex (M1) of human participants who performed a preferential reach task while they were sinusoidally translated on a linear motion platform. If M1 only represents a read-out of the final hand choice, we expect the body motion not to affect the MEP amplitude. If body motion biases the hand selection process prior to target onset, we expect corticospinal excitability to modulate with the phase of the motion, with larger MEP amplitudes for phases that show a bias to using the right hand. Behavioral results replicate our earlier findings of a sinusoidal modulation of hand choice bias with motion phase. MEP amplitudes also show a sinusoidal modulation with motion phase, suggesting that body motion influences corticospinal excitability which may ultimately reflect changes of hand preference. The modulation being present prior to target onset suggests that competition between hands is represented throughout the corticospinal tract. Its phase relationship with the motion profile suggests that other processes after target onset take up time until the hand selection process has been completely resolved, and the reach is initiated. We conclude that the corticospinal correlates of hand preference are modulated by body motion.",

    "abstract": "Skillful object manipulation requires a representation of the objects dynamics. Despite extensive research, previous studies have not been able to provide a consistent view of this representation in the motor system, with each study providing evidence favoring an extrinsic coordinate system, an intrinsic coordinate system, an object-based representation, or mixtures of these coordinate systems. In a series of experiments, we show that the motor system combines different representations based on their reliability. Specifically, since noise creates an error between planned and executed force production which depends on the arm state, the motor system will rely more on the representation for which the plan is less affected. In addition, we show that the error based weights predict the different results made about dynamics representation and thus explaining the discrepancy between influential past studies. Overall, we are able to reconcile all of the apparently disparate findings under a single cohesive model of dynamics representation.",

    "abstract": "The extracellular matrix (ECM) plays a key role in the viability and survival of implanted human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). We hypothesized that coating of three-dimensional (3D) cardiac tissue-derived hiPSC-CMs with the ECM protein fibronectin (FN) would improve the survival of transplanted cells in the heart and improve heart function in a rat model of ischemic heart failure. To test this hypothesis, we first explored the tolerance of FN-coated hiPSC-CMs to hypoxia in an in vitro study. For in vivo assessments, we constructed 3D-hiPSC cardiac tissues (3D-hiPSC-CTs) using a layer-by-layer technique, and then the cells were implanted in the hearts of a myocardial infarction rat model (3D-hiPSC-CTs, n = 10; sham surgery control group (without implant), n = 10). Heart function and histology were analyzed 4 weeks after transplantation. In the in vitro assessment, cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase assays showed that FN-coated hiPSC-CMs had improved tolerance to hypoxia compared with the control cells. In vivo, the left ventricular ejection fraction of hearts implanted with 3D-hiPSC-CT was significantly better than that of the sham control hearts. Histological analysis showed clear expression of collagen type IV and plasma membrane markers such as desmin and dystrophin in vivo after implantation of 3D-hiPSC-CT, which were not detected in 3D-hiPSC-CMs in vitro. Overall, these results indicated that FN-coated 3D-hiPSC-CT could improve distressed heart function in a rat myocardial infarction model with a well-expressed cytoskeletal or basement membrane matrix. Therefore, FN-coated 3D-hiPSC-CT may serve as a promising replacement for heart transplantation and left ventricular assist devices and has the potential to improve survivability and therapeutic efficacy in cases of ischemic heart disease.",

    "abstract": "ObjectiveThe current pandemic has led to a proliferation of predictive models being developed to address various aspects of COVID-19 patient care. We aimed to develop an online platform that would serve as an open source repository for a curated subset of such models, and provide a simple interface for included models to allow for online calculation. This platform would support doctors during decision-making regarding diagnoses, prognoses, and follow-up of COVID-19 patients, expediting the models transition from research to clinical practice.\n\nMethodsIn this proof-of-principle study, we performed a literature search in PubMed and WHO database to find suitable models for implementation on our platform. All selected models were publicly available (peer reviewed publications or open source repository) and had been validated (TRIPOD type 3 or 2b). We created a method for obtaining the regression coefficients if only the nomogram was available in the original publication. All predictive models were transcribed on a practical graphical user interface using PHP 8.0.0, and published online together with supporting documentation and links to the associated articles.\n\nResultsThe open source website https://covid19risk.ai/ currently incorporates nine models from six different research groups, evaluated on datasets from different countries. The website will continue to be populated with other models related to COVID-19 prediction as these become available. This dynamic platform allows COVID-19 researchers to contact us to have their model curated and included on our website, thereby increasing the reach and real-world impact of their work.\n\nConclusionWe have successfully demonstrated in this proof-of-principle study that our website provides an inclusive platform for predictive models related to COVID-19. It enables doctors to supplement their judgment with patient-specific predictions from externally-validated models in a user-friendly format. Additionally, this platform supports researchers in showcasing their work, which will increase the visibility and use of their models.",

It is a cross-sectional study in which twenty-four adult patients that had CRC were submitted to resection surgery. We analyzed the expression of HPSE, HPSE2, MMP-9, and SYND1 by quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Differing from most of the studies that compare the mRNA expression between tumor samples and non-neoplastic tissues, we decided to investigate whether variations exist in the expression of the ECM components between the affected tissue and nontumoral tissue collected from the same patient with CRC. We removed both tissue samples immediately after the surgical resection of CRC. The data showed higher mRNA and protein expression of HPSE2 (P = 0.0058), MMP-9 (P = 0.0268), and SYND1 (P = 0.0002) in tumor samples compared to the non-neoplastic tissues, while there was only an increase in the level of HPSE protein in tumor tissues. A greater expression of HPSE2 was observed in patients with lymph node metastasis (P = 0.048), suggesting that such protein can be a marker of lymph node metastasis in CRC.",

    "abstract": "Sustainable wheat production in drought prone areas can be achieved by developing resilient wheat varieties. In the present study, chemical mutagenesis was used to induce mutations in a cultivated wheat variety  NN-Gandum-1. In total, 44 mutants were selected based on their high yield potential for exposing to well-watered (W1) and rainfed (W2) conditions for one season. Then 24 mutants were selected, and were exposed to W1 and W2 regimes. On the basis of least relative reduction in physiological parameters under W2 regime, five mutants were selected for conducting exome capturing assays. In total, 184 SNPs were identified in nine genes (ABC transporter type 1, Aspartic peptidase, Cytochrome P450, transmembrane domain, Heavy metal-associated domain, HMA, NAC domain, NAD (P)-binding domain, S-type anion channel, Ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 and UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferase). Maximum number of mutations were observed in chr.2D, which contained mutations in three genes i.e. ABC transporter type 1, NAD (P)-binding domain and UDP-glucuronosyl/UDP-glucosyltransferase which may have a role in conferring drought tolerance. The selected mutants were further tested for studying their biochemical responses under both the regimes for two years. The extent of membrane damage was estimated through malondialdehydeand hydrogen per oxidase and tolerance to drought stress was assessed via antioxidant enzymes in leaves. The selected mutants under drought stress increased the accumulation of proline content, total soluble sugars, total free amino acids, while decreased total chlorophyll content, carotenoids and total soluble protein. Finally, the procedure of narrowing down the number of developed mutants from a large mutation population (>4000) is found useful for exploring the complex trait like drought without compromising yield potential. These mutants can further be explored to understand the genetic circuits of drought tolerance in wheat which will pave the way towards improving livelihood of resource poor farming community mostly relying on cereal food.",

    "abstract": "Most countries face challenges attracting and retaining health staff in remote areas but this is especially acute in fragile and shock-prone contexts, like Guinea, where imbalances in staffing are high and financial and governance arrangements to address rural shortfalls are weak.\n\nThe objective of this study was to understand how health staff could be better motivated to work and remain in rural, under-served areas in Guinea. In order to inform the policy dialogue on strengthening human resources for health, we conducted three nationally representative cross-sectional surveys, adapted from tools used in other fragile contexts.\n\nWe found that the locational job preferences of health workers in Guinea are particularly influenced by opportunities for training, working conditions, and housing. Most staff are satisfied with their work and with supervision, however, financial aspects and working conditions are considered least satisfactory, and worrying findings include the high proportion of staff favouring emigration, their high tolerance of informal user payments, as well as their limited exposure to rural areas during training.\n\nBased on our findings, we highlight measures which could improve rural recruitment and retention in Guinea and similar settings. These include offering upgrading and specialization in return for rural service; providing greater exposure to rural areas during training; increasing recruitment from rural areas; experimenting with fixed term contracts in rural areas; and improving working conditions in rural posts. The development of incentive packages should be accompanied by action to tackle wider issues, such as reforms to training and staff management.",

Although artifacts generated from inaccurate reconstruction parameter estimation and noise amplification can be minimized, aberrations due to the scattering of excitation light on samples have rarely been investigated. In this paper, by simulating multiple subcellular structure with the distinct refractive index (RI) from water, we study how different thicknesses of this subcellular structure scatter incident light on its optical path of SIM excitation. Because aberrant interference light aggravates with the increase in sample thickness, the reconstruction of the 2D-SIM SR image degraded with the change of focus along the axial axis. Therefore, this work may guide the future development of algorithms to suppress SIM artifacts caused by scattering in thick samples.",

Unexpectedly, OPA1 deficiency induced fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) as a BATokine in an activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)- dependent manner. BAT-derived FGF21 mediates an adaptive response in OPA1 BAT KO mice, by inducing browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), increasing resting metabolic rates, and improving thermoregulation. However, FGF21 does not mediate the resistance to diet-induced obesity observed in these animals. These findings reveal a requirement for OPA1 in BAT thermogenesis, and uncovers a homeostatic mechanism of BAT-mediated metabolic protection governed by an ATF4-FGF21 axis, that is activated independently of BAT thermogenic function.",

    "abstract": "The first step of cellular entry for the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) occurs through the binding of its envelope protein (Env) with the plasma membrane receptor CD4 and co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 on susceptible cells, primarily CD4+ T cells and macrophages. Although there is considerable knowledge of the molecular interactions between Env and host cell receptors that lead to successful fusion, the precise way in which HIV-1 receptors redistribute to sites of virus binding at the nanoscale remains unknown. Here, we quantitatively examine changes in the nanoscale organisation of CD4 on the surface of CD4+ T cells following HIV-1 binding. Using single-molecule super-resolution imaging, we show that CD4 molecules are distributed mostly as either individual molecules or small clusters of up to 4 molecules. Following virus binding, we observe a local 3-to-10-fold increase in cluster diameter and molecule number for virus-associated CD4 clusters. Moreover, a similar but smaller magnitude reorganisation of CD4 was also observed with recombinant gp120. For the first time, our results quantify the nanoscale CD4 reorganisation triggered by HIV-1 on host cells. Our quantitative approach provides a robust methodology for characterising the nanoscale organisation of plasma membrane receptors in general with the potential to link spatial organisation to function.",

    "abstract": "The three-dimensional structure of human chromosomes is tied to gene regulation and replication timing, but there is still a lack of consensus on the computational and biological definitions for chromosomal substructures such as topologically associating domains (TADs). TADs are described and identified by various computational properties leading to different TAD sets with varying compatibility with biological properties such as boundary occupancy of structural proteins. We unify many of these computational and biological targets into one algorithmic framework that jointly maximizes several computational TAD definitions and optimizes TAD selection for a quantifiable biological property. Using this framework, we explore the variability of TAD sets optimized for six different desirable properties of TAD sets: high occupancy of CTCF, RAD21, and H3K36me3 at boundaries, reproducibility between replicates, high intra- vs inter-TAD difference in contact frequencies, and many CTCF binding sites at boundaries. The compatibility of these biological targets varies by cell type, and our results suggest that these properties are better reflected as subpopulations or families of TADs rather than a singular TAD set fitting all TAD definitions and properties. We explore the properties that produce similar TAD sets (reproducibility and inter- vs intra-TAD difference, for example) and those that lead to very different TADs (such as CTCF binding sites and inter- vs intra-TAD contact frequency difference).",

    "abstract": "Cold temperatures can be fatal to insects, but many species have evolved the ability to cold acclimate, thereby increasing their cold tolerance. While there is a growing body of knowledge concerning the mechanisms underlying cold tolerance, relatively little is known concerning how insects sense noxious cold (cold nociception), or how cold nociception might function in cold tolerance. It has been previously shown that Drosophila melanogaster larvae perform highly stereotyped, cold-evoked behaviors under the control of noxious cold-sensing neurons (nociceptors) innervating the barrier epidermis. In the present study, we first sought to describe cold-nociceptive behavior among 11 drosophilid species with differing cold tolerances and from differing climates. Behavioral analyses revealed that the predominant cold-evoked response among drosophilid larvae is a head-to-tail contraction (CT) behavior, which is likely inherited from a common ancestor. However, despite lack of phylogenetic signal (suggesting trait lability), the CT behavior was transient and there was no clear evidence that cold sensitivity was related to thermal environment; collectively this suggests that the behavior might not be adaptive. We therefore sought to uncover an alternative way that cold nociception might be protective. Using a combination of cold-shock assays, optogenetics, electrophysiology, and methods to genetically disrupt neural transmission, we demonstrate that cold sensing neurons in Drosophila melanogaster (Class III nociceptors) are sensitized by and critical to cold acclimation. Moreover, we demonstrate that cold acclimation can be optogenetically-evoked, sans cold. Collectively, these findings reveal that cold nociception constitutes a peripheral neural basis for Drosophila larval cold acclimation.\n\nSignificance StatementMany insects adapt to cold in response to developmental exposure to cool temperatures. While there is a growing body of knowledge concerning the mechanisms underlying cold tolerance, it is unknown how sensory neurons might contribute. Here, we show that noxious cold sensing (cold nociception) is widely present among drosophilid larvae, and that cold-sensing neurons (Class III cold nociceptors) are necessary and sufficient drivers of cold acclimation. This suggests that cold acclimation has, at least in part, a neural basis.",

    "abstract": "Time-calibrated phylogenies comprising only extant lineages are widely used to estimate historical speciation and extinction rates. Such extinction rate estimates have long been controversial as many phylogenetic studies report zero extinction in many taxa, a finding in conflict with the fossil record. To date, the causes of this widely observed discrepancy remain unresolved. Here we provide a novel and simple explanation for these \"zero-inflated\" extinction rate estimates, based on the recent discovery that there exist many alternative \"congruent\" diversification scenarios that cannot possibly be distinguished on the sole basis of extant timetrees. Consequently, estimation methods tend to converge to some scenario congruent to (i.e., statistically indistinguishable from) the true diversification scenario, but not necessarily to the true diversification scenario itself. This congruent scenario may in principle exhibit negative extinction rates, a biologically meaningless but mathematically feasible situation, in which case estimators will tend to hit and stick to the boundary estimate of zero extinction. To test this explanation, we estimated extinction rates using maximum likelihood for a set of simulated trees and for 121 empirical trees, while either allowing or preventing negative extinction rates. We find that the existence of congruence classes and imposed bounds on extinction rates can explain the zero-inflation of previous extinction rate estimates, even for large trees (1000 tips) and in the absence of any detectable model violations. Not only do our results likely resolve a long-standing mystery in phylogenetics, they demonstrate that model congruencies can have severe consequences in practice.",

    "abstract": "Ultra-high-resolution imaging of the osteocyte lacuno-canalicular network (LCN) three-dimensionally (3D) in a high-throughput fashion has greatly improved the morphological knowledge about the constituent structures - positioning them as potential biomarkers. Technologies such as serial focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) and confocal scanning laser microscopy (CLSM) can image in extremely high resolution, yet only capture a small number of lacunae. Synchrotron radiation computed tomography (SR-CT) can image with both high resolution and high throughput but has a limited availability. Desktop micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) provides an attractive balance: high-throughput imaging on the micron level without the restrictions of SR-CT availability. Over the past decade, desktop micro-CT has been used to image osteocyte lacunae in a variety of animals, yet few studies have employed it to image human lacunae using clinical biopsies.\n\nIn this study, accuracy, reproducibility, and sensitivity of large-scale quantification of human osteocyte lacunar morphometries were assessed by ultra-high-resolution desktop micro-computed tomography. For this purpose, thirty-one transiliac human bone biopsies containing trabecular and cortical regions were imaged using ultra-high-resolution desktop micro-CT at a nominal isotropic voxel resolution of 1.2m. The resulting 3D images were segmented, component labeled, and the following morphometric parameters of 7.71 million lacunae were measured: Lacunar number (Lc.N), density (Lc.N/BV), porosity (Lc.TV/BV), volume (Lc.V), surface area (Lc.S), surface area to volume ratio (Lc.S/Lc.V), stretch (Lc.St), oblateness (Lc.Ob), sphericity (Lc.Sr), equancy (Lc.Eq), and angle (Lc.{theta}).\n\nAccuracy was quantified by comparing automated lacunar identification to manual identification. Mean true positive rate (TPR), false positive rate (FPR), and false negative rate (FNR) were 89.0%, 3.4%, and 11.0%, respectively. Regarding the reproducibility of lacunar morphometry from repeated measurements, precision errors were low (0.2 - 3.0%) and intraclass correlation coefficients were high (0.960 - 0.999). Significant differences between cortical and trabecular regions (p<0.001) existed for Lc.N/BV, Lc.TV/BV, local lacunar surface area (<Lc.S>), and local lacunar volume (<Lc.V>), all of which demonstrate the sensitivity of the method and are possible biomarker candidates. This study provides the foundation required for future large-scale morphometric studies using ultra-high-resolution desktop micro-CT and high-throughput analysis of millions of osteocyte lacunae in human bone samples. Furthermore, the validation of this technology for imaging of human lacunar properties establishes the quality and reliability required for the accurate, precise, and sensitive assessment of osteocyte morphometry in clinical bone biopsies.",

    "abstract": "The protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii is estimated to infect one-third of the worlds population. Infection in pregnant women can cause severe conditions for their babies. Until now, there is no data regarding Toxoplasma infection from Makassar pregnant mothers. This study aims to obtain information on Toxoplasma specific antibodies and to measure the risk factor associate with parasite infection. This cross-sectional study conducted in 9 of 47 primary health centres (Puskesmas) in Makassar. Blood samples and questionnaires were collected from 184 pregnant women aged 15-42 years old from September to October 2020. ELISA technique was used to examine the IgG and IgM antibodies. Univariable and multivariable analyses were carried out to measure factors that independently associate with Toxoplasma antibody positivity. Our result showed the range of Toxoplasma IgM and IgG are 0.06-1.01 and 0.09-3.01, respectively. While no one of our participants has an acute Toxoplasma gondii infection (IgM positive), we found 32,6% pregnant mothers are exposed to parasite (positive IgG). Contact with cats [OR(95CI): 8.04 (3.09-20.87)], consume chicken satay [OR(95CI): 7.46(3.06-18.21)] and consume un-boiled water [OR(95CI): 5.23(1.57-17.38)] are independently associate with positive Toxoplasma IgG antibody. Based on the result, we conclude that pregnant women in Makassar are exposed to T. gondii and the cyst of parasite contaminates food and water in Makassar.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian endoplasmic reticulum (ER) harbors more than 20 members of the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family that act to maintain proteostasis. Herein, we developed an in vitro system for directly monitoring PDI- or ERp46-catalyzed disulfide bond formation in ribosome-associated nascent chains (RNC) of human serum albumin. The results indicated that ERp46 more efficiently introduced disulfide bonds into nascent chains with short segments exposed outside the ribosome exit site than PDI. Single-molecule analysis by high-speed atomic force microscopy further revealed that PDI binds nascent chains persistently, forming a stable face-to-face homodimer, whereas ERp46 binds for a shorter time in monomeric form, indicating their different mechanisms for substrate recognition and disulfide bond introduction. Similarly to ERp46, a PDI mutant with an occluded substrate-binding pocket displayed shorter-time RNC binding and higher efficiency in disulfide introduction than wild-type PDI. Altogether, ERp46 serves as a more potent disulfide introducer especially during the early stages of translation, whereas PDI can catalyze disulfide formation in RNC when longer nascent chains emerge out from ribosome.",

    "abstract": "Vaccinia virus (VACV)-based vectors are in extensive use as vaccines and cancer immunotherapies. VACV engineering has traditionally relied on homologous recombination between a parental viral genome and a transgene-bearing transfer plasmid, a highly inefficient process that necessitates the use of a selection or screening marker to isolate recombinants. Recent extensions of this approach have sought to enhance the recovery of transgene-bearing viruses through the use of CRISPR-Cas9 engineering to cleave the viral genome in infected cells. However, these methods do not completely eliminate the generation of WT viral progeny and thus continue to require multiple rounds of viral propagation and plaque purification. Here, we describe MAVERICC (marker-free vaccinia virus engineering of recombinants through in vitro CRISPR/Cas9 cleavage), a new strategy to engineer recombinant VACVs in a manner that overcomes current limitations. MAVERICC also leverages the CRISPR/Cas9 system but requires no markers and yields essentially pure preparations of the desired recombinants in a single step. We used this approach to rapidly introduce point mutations, insertions, and deletions at multiple locations in the VACV genome, both singly and in combination. The efficiency and versatility of MAVERICC make it an ideal choice for generating mutants and mutant libraries at arbitrarily selected locations in the viral genome to build complex VACV vectors, effect vector improvements, and facilitate the study of poxvirus biology.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=81 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/425447v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17151cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b0f480org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@184166corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dc177d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG Overview of MAVERICC. Conceptual overview of the approach outlined in this manuscript. To make VACV recombinants, the parental virus is first purified and vDNA is isolated with phenol:chloroform extraction. This purified vDNA is then treated with Cas9 enzyme and sgRNAs that are directed to a specific locus in the VACV genome. The cleaved vDNA is then transfected into FWPV-infected BSC-40 cells along with a transfer amplicon containing an insertion or mutation of interest flanked by homologous sequences. Recombination is allowed to occur for 5-7 days, during which time the cleaved vDNA is healed by the transfer amplicon, thus editing the VACV genome, and packaged into infectious viral particles. Individual plaques are grown up and rVACVs are isolated after a single round of plaque purification. Image was created with Biorender.com.",
