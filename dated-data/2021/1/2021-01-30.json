    "abstract": "In obligate symbioses, partner fidelity plays a central role in maintaining the association over evolutionary time. Fidelity has been well studied in hosts with only a few symbionts, but little is known about how fidelity is maintained in obligate associations with multiple co-occurring symbionts. Here, we show that partner fidelity varies from strict to absent in a gutless marine annelid and its consortium of co-occurring symbionts that provide it with nutrition. We sequenced the metagenomes of 80 Olavius algarvensis individuals from the Mediterranean, and compared host mitochondrial and symbiont phylogenies based on single nucleotide polymorphisms across genomes, using a low-coverage sequencing approach that has not yet been applied to microbial community analyses. Fidelity was strongest for the two chemoautotrophic, sulphur-oxidizing symbionts that dominated the microbial consortium in all host individuals. In contrast, fidelity was only intermediate to absent in the sulphate-reducing and spirochaetal symbionts, which occurred in lower abundance and were not always present in all host individuals. We propose that variable degrees of fidelity are advantageous for these hosts by allowing the faithful transmission of their nutritionally most important symbionts and flexibility in the acquisition of other symbionts that promote ecological plasticity in the acquisition of environmental resources.",

    "abstract": "East Coast Fever (ECF), caused by the tick-borne apicomplexan parasite Theileria parva, remains one of the most important livestock diseases in sub-Saharan Africa with more than 1 million cattle dying from infection every year. Disease prevention relies on the so-called \"Infection and Treatment Method\" (ITM), which is costly, complex, laborious, difficult to standardise on a commercial scale and results in a parasite strain specific, MHC class I restricted cytotoxic T cell response. We therefore attempted to develop a safe, affordable, stable, orally applicable and potent subunit vaccine for ECF using five different T. parva schizont antigens (Tp1, Tp2, Tp9, Tp10 and N36) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an expression platform. Full-length native Tp2 and Tp9 as well as fragments of native Tp1 were successfully expressed on the surface of S. cerevisiae. In vitro analyses highlighted that recombinant yeast expressing Tp2 can elicit IFNy responses using PBMCs from ITM-animals, while Tp2 and Tp9 induced IFNy responses from enriched bovine CD8+ T cells. A subsequent in vivo study showed that oral administration of heat-inactivated, freeze-dried yeast stably expressing Tp2 increased total murine serum IgG over time, but more importantly, induce Tp2 specific serum IgG antibodies in individual mice compared to the control group. While these results will require subsequent experiments to verify induction of protection in neonatal calves, our data indicates that oral application of yeast expressing Theileria antigens could provide an affordable and easy vaccination platform for sub-Saharan Africa. Evaluation of antigen specific cellular immune responses, especially cytotoxic CD8+ T cell immunity in cows will further contribute to the development of a yeast-based vaccine for ECF.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDeep learning techniques have yielded tremendous progress in the field of computational biology over the last decade, however many of these techniques are opaque to the user. To provide interpretable results, methods have incorporated biological priors directly into the learning task; one such biological prior is pathway structure. While pathways represent most biological processes in the cell, the high level of correlation and hierarchical structure make it complicated to determine an appropriate computational representation.\n\nResultsHere, we present pathway module Variational Autoencoder (pmVAE). Our method encodes pathway information by restricting the structure of our VAE to mirror gene-pathway memberships. Its architecture is composed of a set of subnetworks, which we refer to as pathway modules. The subnetworks learn interpretable latent representations by factorizing the latent space according to pathway gene sets. We directly address correlation between pathways by balancing a module-specific local loss and a global reconstruction loss. Furthermore, since many pathways are by nature hierarchical and therefore the product of multiple downstream signals, we model each pathway as a multidimensional vector. Due to their factorization over pathways, the representations allow for easy and interpretable analysis of multiple downstream effects, such as cell type and biological stimulus, within the contexts of each pathway. We compare pmVAE against two other state-of-the-art methods on two single-cell RNA-seq case-control data sets, demonstrating that our pathway representations are both more discriminative and consistent in detecting pathways targeted by a perturbation.\n\nAvailability and implementationhttps://github.com/ratschlab/pmvae",

    "abstract": "MotivationThe Estimation of Model Accuracy problem is a cornerstone problem in the field of Bioinformatics. When predictions are made for proteins of which we do not know the native structure, we run into an issue to tell how good a tertiary structure prediction is, especially the protein binding regions, which are useful for drug discovery. Currently, most methods only evaluate the overall quality of a protein decoy, and few can work on residue level and protein complex. Here we introduce ZoomQA, a novel, single-model method for assessing the accuracy of a tertiary protein structure / complex prediction at residue level. ZoomQA differs from others by considering the change in chemical and physical features of a fragment structure (a portion of a protein within a radius r of the target amino acid) as the radius of contact increases. Fourteen physical and chemical properties of amino acids are used to build a comprehensive representation of every residue within a protein and grades their placement within the protein as a whole. Moreover, ZoomQA can evaluate the quality of protein complex, which is unique.\n\nResultsWe benchmark ZoomQA on CASP14, it outperforms other state of the art local QA methods and rivals state of the art QA methods in global prediction metrics. Our experiment shows the efficacy of these new features, and shows our method is able to match the performance of other state-of-the-art methods without the use of homology searching against database or PSSM matrix.\n\nAvailabilityhttp://zoomQA.renzhitech.com\n\nContactcaora@plu.edu",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWLarge-scale genotype-phenotype screens provide a wealth of data for identifying molecular alternations associated with a phenotype. Epistatic effects play an important role in such association studies. For example, siRNA perturbation screens can be used to identify pairwise gene-silencing effects. In bacteria, epistasis has practical consequences in determining antimicrobial resistance as the genetic background of a strain plays an important role in determining resistance. Existing computational tools which account for epistasis do not scale to human exome-wide screens and struggle with genetically diverse bacterial species such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Combining earlier work in interaction detection with recent advances in integer compression, we present a method for epistatic interaction detection on sparse (human) exome-scale data, and an R implementation in the package Pint. Our method takes advantage of sparsity in the input data and recent progress in integer compression to perform lasso-penalised linear regression on all pairwise combinations of the input, estimating up to 200 million potential effects, including epistatic interactions. Hence the human exome is within the reach of our method, assuming one parameter per gene and one parameter per epistatic effect for every pair of genes. We demonstrate Pint on both simulated and real data sets, including antibiotic resistance testing and siRNA perturbation screens.",
