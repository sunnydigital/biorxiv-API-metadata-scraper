    "abstract": "Many proteins have been shown to function via liquid-liquid phase separation. Computational modeling could offer much needed structural details of protein condensates and reveal the set of molecular interactions that dictate their stability. However, the presence of both ordered and disordered domains in these proteins places a high demand on the model accuracy. Here, we present an algorithm to derive a coarse-grained force field, MOFF, that can model both ordered and disordered proteins with consistent accuracy. It combines maximum entropy biasing, least-squares fitting, and basic principles of energy landscape theory to ensure that MOFF recreates experimental radii of gyration while predicting the folded structures for globular proteins with lower energy. The theta temperature determined from MOFF separates ordered and disordered proteins at 300 K and exhibits a strikingly linear relationship with amino acid sequence composition. We further applied MOFF to study the phase behavior of HP1, an essential protein for posttranslational modification and spatial organization of chromatin. The force field successfully resolved the structural difference of two HP1 homologs, despite their high sequence similarity. We carried out large scale simulations with hundreds of proteins to determine the critical temperature of phase separation and uncover multivalent interactions that stabilize higher-order assemblies. In all, our work makes significant methodological strides to connect theories of ordered and disordered proteins and provides a powerful tool for studying liquid-liquid phase separation with near-atomistic details.",

    "abstract": "Insect neural systems are a promising source of inspiration for new algorithms for navigation, especially on low size, weight, and power platforms. There have been unprecedented recent neuroscience breakthroughs with Drosophila in behavioral and neural imaging experiments as well as the mapping of detailed connectivity of neural structures. General mechanisms for learning orientation in the central complex (CX) of Drosophila have been investigated previously; however, it is unclear how these underlying mechanisms extend to cases where there is translation through an environment (beyond only rotation), which is critical for navigation in robotic systems. Here, we develop a CX neural connectivity-constrained model that performs sensor fusion, as well as unsupervised learning of visual features for path integration; we demonstrate the viability of this circuit for use in robotic systems in simulated and physical environments. Furthermore, we propose a theoretical understanding of how distributed online unsupervised network weight modification can be leveraged for learning in a trajectory through an environment by minimizing of orientation estimation error. Overall, our results here may enable a new class of CX-derived low power robotic navigation algorithms and lead to testable predictions to inform future neuroscience experiments.\n\nSummaryAn insect neural connectivity-constrained model performs sensor fusion and online learning for orientation estimation.",

    "abstract": "NG2 glia or oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are distributed throughout the gray and white matter and generate myelinating cells. OPCs in white matter proliferate more than those in gray matter in response to platelet-derived growth factor AA (PDGF AA), despite similar levels of its alpha receptor (PDGFR) on their surface. Here we show that the type 1 integral membrane protein Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is expressed not on OPCs but on amoeboid and activated microglia in white but not gray matter in an age- and activity-dependent manner. Microglia-specific deletion of Nrp1 compromised developmental OPC proliferation in white matter as well as OPC expansion and subsequent myelin repair after acute demyelination. Exogenous Nrp1 increased PDGF AA-induced OPC proliferation and PDGFR phosphorylation on dissociated OPCs, most prominently in the presence of suboptimum concentrations of PDGF AA. These findings uncover a novel mechanism of regulating oligodendrocyte lineage cell density that involves trans-activation of PDGFR on OPCs via Nrp1 expressed by adjacent microglia.",

    "abstract": "Neisseria meningitidis, a human-specific bacterium, is responsible for meningitis and fatal fulminant systemic disease. Bacteria colonize blood vessels, rapidly causing devastating vascular damage despite a neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate. How this pathogen escapes the neutrophil response is unknown. Using a humanized mouse model, we show that vascular colonization leads to the recruitment of neutrophils, partially reducing bacterial burden and vascular damage. This partial effect is due to the ability of bacteria to indiscriminately colonize capillaries, venules and arterioles, as observed in human samples. In venules, potent neutrophil recruitment allows efficient bacterial phagocytosis. In contrast, in infected capillaries and arterioles adhesion molecules such as E-Selectin are not expressed on the endothelium and intravascular neutrophil recruitment is minimal. These results show that colonization of capillaries and arterioles by N. meningitidis create an intravascular niche that preclude the action of neutrophils, resulting in immune escape and subsequent fulminant progression of the infection.",

    "abstract": "Cytoplasmic stress granules (SGs) are dynamic non-membranous foci containing translationally arrested mRNA and RNA binding proteins that form in response to a variety of cellular stressors. SGs may evolve into the cytoplasmic inclusions observed in many neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have examined the SG proteome by interrogating the interactome of G3BP1, a core SG protein. To gain further insight into the SG proteome, we employed an immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry approach of endogenous Caprin-1 in HeLa cells under unstressed or stressed conditions. Overall, we identified ~1,500 proteins that interact with Caprin-1. Interactors under stressed conditions were primarily annotated to the ribosome, spliceosome, and RNA transport pathways. We validated four Caprin-1 interactors that localized to arsenite-induced SGs: ANKHD1, Talin-1, GEMIN5, and SNRNP200. We also validated these stress-induced interactions in SH-SY5Y cells and determined that SNRNP200 also associated with osmotic and thermal induced SGs. Finally, we identified SNRNP200 in cytoplasmic aggregates in ALS spinal cord and motor cortex. Collectively, our findings provide the first description of the Caprin-1 protein interactome, identify novel cytoplasmic SG components, and reveal a SG protein in cytoplasmic aggregates in ALS patients.

Atx2 undergoes polyglutamine expansion leading to Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or Spinocerebellar Ataxia type 2 (SCA2). However, the physiological functions of Atx2 in neurons remain unknown. Here, using the powerful genetics of Drosophila, we show that Atx2 is essential for normal neuronal cytoskeletal dynamics and organelle trafficking. Upon neuron-specific Atx2 loss, the microtubule and actin networks were abnormally stabilized and cargo transport was drastically inhibited. Depletion of Atx2 caused multiple morphological defects in the nervous system of 3rd instar larvae. These include reduced brain size, impaired optic lobe innervation and decreased dendrite outgrowth. Defects in the nervous system caused loss of the ability to crawl and lethality at the pupal stage. Taken together, these data mark Atx2 as a major regulator of cytoskeletal dynamics and denote Atx2 as an essential gene in neurodevelopment, as well as a neurodegenerative factor.",

    "abstract": "Pacemaker hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) ion channels exhibit a reversed voltage-dependent gating, activating by membrane hyperpolarization instead of depolarization. Sea urchin HCN (spHCN) channels also undergo an inactivation with hyperpolarization which occurs only in the absence of cyclic nucleotide. Here we applied transition metal ion FRET and Rosetta modeling to measure differences in the structural rearrangements between activation and inactivation of spHCN channels. We found that removal of cAMP produced a largely rigid-body rotation of the C-linker relative to transmembrane domain, bringing the A helix in close proximity to the voltage-sensing S4 helix. In addition, rotation of the C-linker was elicited by hyperpolarization in the absence but not in the presence of cAMP. These results suggest the A helix functions like a mechanical clutch to engage inactivation. cAMP binding disengages the clutch, permitting the hyperpolarization-dependent activation mediated by the S5 helix. Furthermore, rearrangement of A helix during recovery from inactivation of spHCN channels was similar to that for the activation of KCNH channels, suggesting a conserved mechanism for this noncanonical electromechanical coupling in the CNBD channel family.",

    "abstract": "The external pallidum (GPe) plays a central role for basal ganglia functions and dynamics and, consequently, has been included in most computational studies of the basal ganglia. These studies considered the GPe as a homogeneous neural population. However, experimental studies have shown that the GPe contains at least two distinct cell types (prototypical and arkypallidal cells). In this work, we provide in silico insight into how pallidal heterogeneity modulates dynamic regimes inside the GPe and how they affect the GPe response to oscillatory input.\n\nWe derive a mean-field model of the GPe system from a microscopic spiking neural network of recurrently coupled prototypical and arkypallidal neurons. Using bifurcation analysis, we examine the influence of the intra-pallidal connectivity on the GPe dynamics. We find that under healthy conditions, the inhibitory coupling determines whether the GPe is close to either a bi-stable or an oscillatory regime. Furthermore, we show that oscillatory input to the GPe, arriving from subthalamic nucleus or striatum, leads to characteristic patterns of cross-frequency coupling observed at the GPe. Based on these findings, we propose two different hypotheses of how dopamine depletion at the GPe may lead to phase-amplitude coupling between the parkinsonian beta rhythm and a GPe-intrinsic gamma rhythm. Finally, we show that these findings generalize to realistic spiking neural networks of sparsely coupled type-I excitable GPe neurons.\n\nSignificant StatementOur work provides (a) insight into the theoretical implications of a dichotomous GPe organization for its macroscopic dynamic regimes, and (b) an exact mean-field model that allows for future investigations of the relationship between GPe spiking activity and local field potential fluctuations. We identify the major phase transitions that the GPe can undergo when subject to static or periodic input and link these phase transitions to the emergence of synchronized oscillations and cross-frequency coupling in the basal ganglia. Due to the close links between our model and experimental findings on the structure and dynamics of prototypical and arkypallidal cells, our results can be used to guide both experimental and computational studies on the role of the GPe for basal ganglia dynamics in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "The queen conch fishery in Jamaica is sustained by Pedro Bank, which is the main harvesting site located approximately 80 km south-west from Kingston. Due to its relative size, Pedro Bank has been subdivided into zones for management purposes by the Fisheries Division and the Veterinary Services Division. Understanding whether these sub-divisions reflect different sub-populations is critical for managing exploitation levels because fisheries management must demonstrate that harvesting does not endanger the future viability of the population as queen conch are on Appendix II of the Convention in Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This determination is essential for the continued export to international markets such as the European Union. Two hundred and eight samples were collected across the entire Pedro Bank and were genetically characterized using nine polymorphic microsatellite loci. Population structure analysis for Lobatus gigas from Pedro Bank yielded low but significant values (FST = 0.009: p = 0.006) and suggested a high magnitude of gene flow indicative of a fit and viable population throughout the bank. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated a 100% variation within individual samples with little variation (0.9%) between populations. In contrast pairwise genetic comparisons identified significant differences between populations located to the south eastern and eastern region of the bank to those in the central and western locations. Bayesian clustering analysis also indicated the likelihood of two population sub-divisions (K=2) on Pedro Bank. The results provided evidence of a weak but significant population structure which has crucial implications for the fishing industry as it suggests the use of ecosystem based management (EBM) in setting quotas to promote sustainable harvesting of L. gigas within each monitoring zone on Pedro Bank.",

    "abstract": "A new analysis and classification method of vascular disease based on topological data analysis (TDA) has been proposed in [1]. The proposed method utilizes the application of persistent homology to hemodynamic variables. Particularly, 2D homology is obtained from the velocity field of the flow projected onto the unit sphere, known as so-called the S2 projection. It was shown that such homology is closely related to the degree of vascular disease. The original method was developed based on the computational fluid dynamic (CFD) solutions of the straight stenotic vessels.\n\nIn this paper, we develop a preprocessing method that enables the proposed TDA method to be applied to general stenotic vessels of irregular geometry. The velocity field is subject to a coordinate transformation correcting for orientation and curved geometry. The preprocessed data is projected onto S2 and the corresponding homology is calculated. We show that this preprocessing is necessary for the proposed TDA method to be successfully applied to general types of stenotic vessels. Validation was performed on a set of clinical data including reconstructed vascular geometry with corresponding diagnostic indices.",

    "abstract": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global pandemic that began in December 2019. Lymphopenia is a common feature in severe cases of COVID-19; however, the role of T cell responses during infection is unclear. Here, we inoculated six cynomolgus monkeys, divided into two groups according to the CD3+ T cell population in peripheral blood, with two clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2: one of East Asian lineage and one of European lineage. After initial infection with the isolate of East Asian lineage, all three monkeys in the CD3+ low group showed clinical symptoms, including loss of appetite, lethargy, and transient severe anemia with/without short-term fever, within 14 days post-infection (p.i.). By contrast, all three monkeys in the CD3+ high group showed mild clinical symptoms such as mild fever and loss of appetite within 4 days p.i. and then recovered. After a second inoculation with the isolate of European lineage, three of four animals in both groups showed mild clinical symptoms but recovered quickly. Hematological, immunological, and serological tests suggested that the CD3+ high and low groups mounted different immune responses during the initial and second infection stages. In both groups, anti-viral and innate immune responses were activated during the early phase of infection and re-infection. However, in the CD3+ low group, inflammatory responses, such as increased production of monocytes and neutrophils, were stronger than those in the CD3+ high group, leading to more severe immunopathology and failure to eliminate the virus. Taken together, the data suggest that the peripheral T lymphocyte population is associated with pneumonia severity in cynomolgus monkeys experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAuthor summarySARS-CoV-2 infection causes an illness with clinical manifestations that vary from asymptomatic or mild to severe; examples include severe pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Lymphopenia, which is common in severe COVID-19 cases, is characterized by markedly reduced numbers of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells. Here, we showed that cynomolgus monkeys selected according to the T cell populations in peripheral blood have different outcomes after experimental infection with SARS-CoV-2. These findings will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and may facilitate the development of animal models for vaccine evaluation.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundFor their functions of insulin biosynthesis and glucose- and fatty acid- induced insulin secretion, the Langerhans {beta}-cells require an intracellular milieu rich in oxygen. This requirement makes {beta}-cells, with their constitutively low antioxidative defense, susceptible to the oxidative stress. Although much progress has been made in identifying its molecular basis in the experimental systems, whether the oxidative stress due to excessive fatty acids plays a crucial role in the Langerhans degeneration in primates is still debated.\n\nMethodsFocusing on Hsp70.1, which has dual functions as a molecular chaperone and lysosomal stabilizer, the mechanism of lipotoxicity to the Langerhans islet cells was studied using Japanese macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata) after the consecutive injections of the lipid peroxidation product hydroxynonenal. Based on the  calpain-cathepsin hypothesis of ischemic neuronal death formulated in 1998, calpain activation, Hsp70.1 cleavage, and lysosomal integrity were studied by immunofluorescence histochemistry, electron microscopy and Western blotting.\n\nResultsLight microscopy showed higher vacuole formation in the treated islet cells than in the control cells. Electron microscopy showed that vacuolar changes that were identified as enlarged rough endoplasmic reticula occurred mainly in {beta}-cells followed by {delta}-cells. Intriguingly, both cell types showed a marked decrease in insulin and somatostatin granules. Furthermore, they exhibited marked increases in peroxisomes, autophagosomes/autolysosomes, lysosomal and peroxisomal membrane rupture/permeabilization, and mitochondrial degeneration. Disrupted peroxisomes were often localized in the close vicinity of degenerating mitochondria or autolysosomes. Immunofluorescence histochemical analysis showed an increased colocalization of activated -calpain and Hsp70.1 with the extralysosomal release of cathepsin B. Western blotting showed increases in -calpain activation, Hsp70.1 cleavage, and hydroxynonenal receptor GPR109A expression.\n\nConclusionsTaken together, these data implicate hydroxynonenal in both the carbonylation of Hsp70.1 and the activation of -calpain. The calpain-mediated cleavage of the carbonyl group on Hsp70.1 after the hydroxynonenal-mediated carbonylation of Hsp70.1, may cause lysosomal membrane rupture/permeabilization. The low defense of primate Langerhans cells against exogenous hydroxynonenal and peroxisomally-generated hydrogen peroxide, was presumably overwhelmed to facilitate cell degeneration.",

Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and compared with {chi}2 test. The total estimated populations of Swaynes Hartebeest (SHB) in the study period were 1456 and 1492 during wet and dry seasons, respectively showing no seasonal variation. Among the total estimated population, 31% were adult males, 38.46% adult females, 13.97% sub adult males, 15.94% sub adult females and 1.07% young. The number of adult females was higher than the other age groups followed by adult males in both seasons. Significant differences were reported among age and sex structure of population size during both seasons (wet season: {chi}2= 58.423, df =3, P < 0.05; dry season: {chi}2=534.079, df= 4, P < 0.05). The maximum group size was 36 and the minimum was 1. The ratio of adult males to adult females was 1:1.24 and 1:1.24, sub-adult males to sub adult females was 1:1.16 and 1:1.12, adult males to sub-adult males was 1:0.36 and 1:0.56, adult females to sub-adult females was 1:0.33 and 1:0.49 in the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The male to female ratio was 1:1.22 and 1:1.19 during wet and dry seasons as well. The population trend among ten years were significantly differed ({chi}2 = 1.708, df= 9, P< 0.05). The SHB was distributed into three types of habitat (riverine forest, open grassland and scattered tree) with significant differences ({chi}2=1109.937, df = 3, P < 0.05). The savannah grass land was most preferable habitat followed by scattered tree habitat. Maintaining its critical habitat was highly recommended for sustainability of current population status.",

    "abstract": "Chromosome 4q21 microdeletion leads to a human syndrome that exhibits restricted growth, facial dysmorphisms, mental retardation, and absent or delayed speech. One of the key genes in the affected region of the chromosome is PRKG2, which encodes cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII). Mice lacking cGKII exhibit restricted growth and deficits in learning and memory, as seen in the human syndrome. However, speech/vocalization impairments in these mice have not been determined. Moreover, the molecular pathway underlying speech impairment in humans is not fully understood. Here, we employed cGKII knockout (KO) mice as a model for the human microdeletion syndrome to test whether vocalizations are affected by loss of the PRKG2 gene. Mice emit ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) to communicate in social situations, stress, and isolation. We thus recorded ultrasonic vocalizations as a model for speech in humans. We isolated postnatal day 5-7 pups from the nest to record and analyze USVs and found significant differences in vocalizations of KO mice relative to wild-type and heterozygous mutant mice. KO mice produced fewer calls that were shorter duration, higher frequency, and lower intensity. Because neuronal activity in the hypothalamus is important for the production of animal USVs following isolation from the nest, we assessed hypothalamic activity in KO pups following isolation. Indeed, we found abnormal hyperactivation of hypothalamic neurons in cGKII KO pups after isolation. Taken together, our studies indicate that cGKII is important for neuronal activation in the hypothalamus, which is required for the production of USVs in neonatal mice. We further suggest cGKII KO mice can be a valuable animal model for human microdeletion 4q21 syndrome.\n\nHighlightsO_LIChromosome 4q21 microdeletion leads to a human syndrome that exhibits restricted growth, mental retardation, and absent or delayed speech.\nC_LIO_LIThe cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII) gene is one of the genes located in the affected region of the chromosome.\nC_LIO_LIcGKII knockout mice show restricted growth and deficits in learning and memory.\nC_LIO_LIAltered ultrasonic vocalizations and abnormal activation in hypothalamic neurons are found when infant cGKII knockout pups are isolated from the nest.\nC_LIO_LIcGKII knockout mice can be a valuable animal model for human microdeletion 4q21 syndrome.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) PPE36, a cell-wall associated protein is highly specific and conserved for the Mtb complex group. Although it has been proven essential for iron utilization, little is known about the role of PPE36 in regulating host immune responses. Here we exhibited that PPE36 preferentially enriched in Mtb virulent strains, and could efficiently inhibit host inflammatory responses and increase bacterial loads both in mycobacterium-infected macrophages and mice. In exploring the underlying mechanisms, we found that PPE36 could robustly inhibit the activation of inflammatory NF-{kappa}B and MAPK (ERK, p38 and JNK) pathways by promoting E3 ligase Smurf1-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of MyD88 protein. Our research revealed a previously unknown function of PPE36 on modulating host immune responses, and provided some clues to the development of novel tuberculosis treatment strategies based on immune regulation.\n\nAuthor SummaryMycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has developed diverse immune evasion strategies to successfully establish infection in host. Identifying the important Mtb immune regulatory proteins and elucidating the underlying mechanisms are critical for tuberculosis control. Here we demonstrated that PPE36, a Mtb cell-wall associated protein, was predominantly enriched in virulent mycobacterial strains, and obviously inhibited inflammatory responses and facilitated bacterial survival in infected macrophages. Compared with the wild-type BCG, BCG lacking PPE36 (BCG{Delta}PPE36) induced more inflammation, lower bacterial loads as well as the improved histopathological changes in the lungs of infected mice. We further found that PPE36 significantly reduced host MyD88 abundance, and inhibited the activation of subsequunt inflammatory NF-{kappa}B and MAPK pathways. In addition, this direct inhibition effect of PPE36 on MyD88 was mediated by the promoted E3 ligase Smurf1 ubiquitin -protesome pathway. This study identified PPE36 as a immune regulatory protein of Mtb, and showed it played an important role in the Mtb immune evasion.",

    "abstract": "Intrauterine infection/inflammation (IUI) is a major contributor to preterm labor (PTL). However, IUI does not invariably cause PTL. We hypothesized that quantitative and qualitative differences in immune response exist in subjects with or without PTL. To define the triggers for PTL, we developed Rhesus macaque models of IUI driven by lipopolysaccharyde (LPS) or live E. coli. PTL did not occur in LPS challenged Rhesus macaque while E. coli infected animals frequently delivered preterm. Although LPS and live E. coli both caused immune cell infiltration, E. coli infected animals showed higher levels of inflammatory mediators, particularly IL6 and prostaglandins, in the chorioamnion decidua and amniotic fluid. Neutrophil infiltration in the chorion was a common feature to both LPS and E. coli. However, neutrophilic infiltration and IL6 and PTGS2 expression in the amnion was specifically induced by live E. coli. RNASeq analysis of fetal membranes revealed that specific pathways involved in augmentation of inflammation including type I interferon response, chemotaxis, sumoylation and iron homeostasis were upregulated in the E. coli group compared to the LPS group. Our data suggest that intensity of the host immune response to IUI may determine susceptibility to PTL.",

    "abstract": "Parasitic infections can be challenging to study, because light and electron microscopy are often limited in visualising complex and inaccessible attachment sites. Exemplifying this, Trichuris spp. inhabits a tunnel of epithelial cells within the host caecum and colon. A significant global burden of this infection persists partly because available anthelminthics lack efficacy, although the mechanisms underlying this remain unknown. Consequently, there is a need to pioneer new approaches to better characterize the parasite niche within the host and investigate how variation in its morphology and integrity may contribute to resistance to therapeutic intervention. To address these aims, we exploited 3D X-ray micro-computed tomography (microCT) to image the mouse whipworm T. muris in caeca of wild-type C57BL/6 and SCID mice ex vivo. Using osmium tetroxide staining to effectively enhance contrast of worms, we found that a subset exhibited preferential positioning towards the bases of the intestinal crypts. Moreover, in one rare event, we demonstrate whipworm traversal of the lamina propria. This morphological variability contradicts widely accepted conclusions from conventional microscopy of the parasite niche, showing Trichuris in close contact with the host proliferative and immune compartments that may facilitate immunomodulation. Furthermore, by using a skeletonization-based approach we demonstrate considerable variation in tunnel length and integrity which may represent an indicator of tunnel \"health\". The qualitative and quantitative observations provide a new morphological point of reference for future in vitro study of Trichuris-host interactions and highlight the potential of microCT to more accurately characterise enigmatic host-parasite interactions.\n\nAuthor SummaryParasites are often difficult to observe once established within host tissues, presenting a barrier to biological understanding and therapeutic innovation. Whipworms (Trichuris spp.) affect 500 million people worldwide, causing significant disability, and appear partially resistant to widely used \"deworming\" drugs. However, the inaccessibility of worms within the cells of the host intestine makes them highly challenging to image and study. By investigating Trichuris attachment sites in 3D, using X-ray micro-computed tomography, we found that the niche is highly variable in size and, contrary to reports in all previous studies, can also penetrate different layers of intestinal tissue. By showing that worms are positioned much closer to host immune cells that previously appreciated, we provide a morphological reference point for future studies on how Trichuris effectively avoids clearance by the host. The non-invasive imaging approach used represents an excellent opportunity to clarify the lifecycles of other difficult-to-study parasites.",

    "abstract": "Bacillus cereus is a foodborne pathogen and can form biofilms on food contact surfaces, which causes food hygiene problems. While it is necessary to understand strain-dependent variation to effectively control these biofilms, strain-to-strain variation in the structure of B cereus biofilms is poorly understood. In this study, B. cereus strains from tatsoi and the ATCC 10987 reference strain were incubated at 30{degrees}C to form biofilms in the presence of the extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes DNase I, proteinase K, dispase II, cellulase, amyloglucosidase, and -amylase to assess the susceptibility to these enzymes. The four strains exhibited four different patterns in terms of biofilm susceptibility to the enzymes as well as morphology of surface-attached biofilms or suspended cell aggregates. DNase I inhibited the biofilm formation of strains ATCC 10987 and BC4 but not of strains BC10 and BC72. This result suggests that some strains may not have extracellular DNA, or their extracellular DNA may be protected in their biofilms. In addition, the strains exhibited different patterns of susceptibility to protein- and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes. While other strains were resistant, strains ATCC 10987 and BC4 were susceptible to cellulase, suggesting that cellulose or its similar polysaccharides may exist and play an essential role in their biofilm formation. Our compositional analysis of strains ATCC 10987 and BC4 suggested that the physicochemical properties of their biofilms are distinct, as calculated by the carbohydrate to protein ratio. Taken together, our study suggests that the extracellular matrix of B. cereus biofilms may be highly diverse and provides insight into the diverse mechanisms of biofilm formation among B. cereus strains.",

    "abstract": "The subcellular membrane-trafficking system plays many roles in cell growth and morphogenesis, from bulk membrane provision to targeted delivery of membrane proteins and other cargos. In tracheal terminal cells of the Drosophila respiratory system, endocytosis and trafficking through late endosomes balances membrane delivery between the basal plasma membrane and the apical membrane that forms a subcellular tube, but it has been unclear how the direction of growth of the subcellular tube with the overall growth of the cell is coordinated. We show here that endosomes are involved in this process as coordinators of F-actin. Actin assembles around late endocytic vesicles in the growth cone of the cell, reaching from the tip of the subcellular tube to the leading filopodia of the basal membrane. Preventing actin nucleation at late endosomes disturbs the directionality of tube growth, uncoupling it from the direction of cell elongation. Severing actin in this area affects tube integrity. Our findings show a new role for late endosomes in directing cell morphogenesis by organizing actin, in addition to their known role in membrane and protein trafficking.",

    "abstract": "Mechanisms regulating serotonin (5-HT) homeostasis at the maternal-fetal interface are important for proper placental functioning and fetal (neuro)development. Here we studied 5-HT uptake mechanisms in human primary trophoblasts, feto-placental endothelial cells and cord blood platelets, all isolated directly after birth. Trophoblasts and cord blood platelets demonstrated high-affinity 5-HT uptake with similar Michaelis constant (Km) values (0.60{+/-}0.27 and 0.65{+/-}0.18 M, respectively). In contrast, feto-placental endothelial cells displayed saturation kinetics only over the low-affinity range of 5-HT concentrations (Km=782{+/-}218 M). 5-HT uptake into trophoblasts was inhibited by various psychotropic drugs targeting high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT), and into feto-placental endothelial cells by an inhibitor of low-affinity transporters. SERT mRNAs were abundant in trophoblasts, but sparse in feto-placental endothelial cells; the opposite was found for transcripts of the low-affinity plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT). These results show for the first time the presence of functional 5-HT uptake systems in feto-placental endothelial cells and fetal platelets, cells in direct contact with the fetal blood plasma. Data also emphasize sensitivity of 5-HT transport into trophoblasts, cells facing maternal blood, to various psychotropic drugs. The multiple, high- and low-affinity, systems present for cellular 5-HT uptake highlight the importance of maintaining 5-HT homeostasis at the maternal-fetal interface.",

    "abstract": "The first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS CoV2) was imported to Pakistan in February 2020 since then 10,258 deaths have been witnessed. The virus has been mutating and local transmission cases from different countries vary due to host dependent viral adaptation. Many distinct clusters of variant SARS CoV2 have been defined globally. In this study, the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 was studied and locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.The real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to confirm SARSCoV2 with Orf 1ab and E gene as targets. The viral sequencing was performed through oxford nanopore technology MinION platform. Isolates from first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi were compared. The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with highest number of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged between 19-40 years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense mutation D614G in spike protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. Another spike protein mutation A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from second wave of COVID-19. Based on the present findings it is suggested that the locally transmitted virus from Karachi vary from those reported from other parts of Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between viruses from first and second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in failed trials therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for effective vaccine design and/or selection.\n\nAuthors summaryDespite precautionary measures the COVID-19 pandemic is causing deaths all over the world. The continuous mutations in viral genome is making it difficult to design vaccines. Variability in genome is host dependent and data sharing has revealed that variant for different geographical locations may harbor different mutations. Keeping this in mind the current study was focused on the epidemiology of SARS CoV2 in symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID -19 suspected cases with impact of age and gender. The locally transmitted SARS CoV2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants. The sequenced viral genome varied from the already submitted sequences from Pakistan thereby confirming that slightly different viruses were causing infections during different time periods in Karachi. All belonged to GH clade with D614G, P323L and Q57H mutations. The virus from second wave had A222V mutation making it more different. This information can be useful in selecting or designing a vaccine.",

However, the mechanisms by which dynamic signals are decoded into appropriate gene expression patterns remain poorly understood. Here, we devise networked optogenetic pathways that achieve novel dynamic signal processing functions that recapitulate cellular information processing. Exploiting light-responsive transcriptional regulators with differing response kinetics, we build a falling-edge pulse-detector and show that this circuit can be employed to demultiplex dynamically encoded signals. We combine this demultiplexer with dCas9-based gene networks to construct pulsatile-signal filters and decoders. Applying information theory, we show that dynamic multiplexing significantly increases the information transmission capacity from signal to gene expression state. Finally, we use dynamic multiplexing for precise multidimensional regulation of a heterologous metabolic pathway. Our results elucidate design principles of dynamic information processing and provide original synthetic systems capable of decoding complex signals for biotechnological applications.",

    "abstract": "Myocardial infarction is a leading cause of death worldwide, as the adult human heart does not have the ability to regenerate efficiently after insults. In contrast, the adult zebrafish heart has a high capacity for regeneration, and understanding the mechanisms of regenerative processes in fish allows identification of novel therapeutic strategies. While several pro-regenerative factors have been described, the cell types orchestrating heart regeneration remain largely elusive. To overcome this conceptual limitation, we dissected cell type diversity in the regenerating zebrafish heart based on single cell transcriptomics and spatiotemporal analysis. We discovered a dramatic induction of several pro-regenerative cell types with fibroblast characteristics. To understand the cascade of events leading to heart regeneration, we determined the origin of these cell types by high-throughput lineage tracing. We found that pro-regenerative fibroblasts are derived from two separate sources, the epicardium and the endocardium. Mechanistically, we identified Wnt signaling as a key regulator of the endocardial regenerative response. In summary, our results uncover specialized fibroblast cell types as major drivers of heart regeneration, thereby opening up new possibilities to interfere with the regenerative capacity of the vertebrate heart.",

    "abstract": "Cardiac fibrosis accompanies a number of pathological conditions and results in altered myocardial structure, biomechanical properties and function. The signaling networks leading to fibrosis are complex, contributing to the general lack of progress in identifying effective therapeutic approaches to prevent or reverse this condition. Several studies have shown protective effects of emodin, a plant-derived anthraquinone, in animal models of fibrosis. A number of questions remain regarding the mechanisms whereby emodin impacts fibrosis. TGF-{beta}1 is a potent stimulus of fibrosis and fibroblast activation. In the present study, experiments were performed to evaluate the effects of emodin on activation and function of cardiac fibroblasts following treatment with TGF-{beta}1. We demonstrate that emodin attenuates TGF-{beta}1-induced fibroblast activation and collagen accumulation in vitro. Emodin also inhibits activation of several canonical (SMAD2/3) and non-canonical (Erk1/2) TGF-{beta} signaling pathways, while activating the p38 pathway. These results suggest that emodin may provide an effective therapeutic agent for fibrosis that functions via specific TGF-{beta} signaling pathways.",

    "abstract": "Sorsby Fundus Dystrophy (SFD) is a rare form of macular degeneration that is clinically similar to age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and a histologic hallmark of SFD is a thick layer of extracellular deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Previous studies of SFD patient-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived RPE differ as to whether these cultures recapitulate this key clinical feature by forming increased drusenoid deposits. The primary purpose of this study is to examine whether SFD patient-derived iPSC-RPE form basal deposits similar to what is found in affected family member SFD globes and to determine whether SFD iPSC RPE may be more oxidatively stressed. We performed a careful comparison of iPSC RPE from three control individuals, multiple iPSC clones from two SFD patients iPSC RPE, and post-mortem eyes of affected SFD family members. We also examined the effect of CRISPR-Cas9 gene correction of the S204C TIMP3 mutation on RPE phenotype. Finally, targeted metabolomics analysis with liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis and stable isotope-labeled metabolite analysis was performed to determine whether SFD RPE are more oxidatively stressed. We found that SFD iPSC-RPE formed significantly more sub-RPE deposits ([~]6-90 m in height) compared to control RPE at 8 weeks. These deposits were similar in composition to the basal laminar drusen found in SFD family member globes by immunofluorescence staining and TEM imaging. S204C TIMP3 correction by CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing in SFD iPSC RPE cells resulted in significantly reduced basal laminar and sub-RPE calcium deposits. We detected a [~]18-fold increase in TIMP3 accumulation in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of SFD RPE, and targeted metabolomics showed that intracellular 4-hydroxyproline, a major breakdown product of collagen, is significantly elevated in SFD RPE, suggesting increased ECM turnover. Finally, SFD RPE cells have decreased intracellular reduced glutathione and were found to be more vulnerable to oxidative stress. Our findings suggest that elements of SFD pathology can be demonstrated in culture which may lead to insights into disease mechanisms.",

The cilia-localized G-protein-coupled receptor--Gpr161 represses hedgehog pathway via cAMP signaling. Here, by generating knock-in mutant mouse at endogenous Gpr161 locus (mut1), we show that ciliary and extraciliary receptor pools repress hedgehog signaling in a tissue-specific manner. Gpr161mut1 was competent in generating cAMP but did not transit through cilia. Compared to knockout, Gpr161mut1 had delayed embryonic lethality, less upregulation of hedgehog targets and partially down-regulated Gli3-repressor. Ventral-most progenitor expansion in neural tube of Gpr161 knockout occurred in a Gli2-activator-dependent manner but was not seen in Gpr161mut1. Intermediate-level ventralization occurred from Gpr161 lack specifically in cilia but was restored by increased extraciliary mutant generating Gli3-repressor. Morphogenesis in limb buds and midface that require Gli-repressor manifested hedgehog hyperactivation phenotypes-- polydactyly and midfacial widening--in Gpr161mut1. Thus, ciliary and extraciliary cAMP signaling establishes tissue-specific Gli-repressor thresholds in dictating morpho-phenotypic outcomes.\n\nImpact statementO_ST_ABSSignaling by CiliaC_ST_ABSSignaling by cAMP specifically in cilia directs tissue-specific morphogenesis",

We equalized AB and P1 sizes using acute genetic inactivation or optogenetic manipulation of the spindle positioning protein LIN-5. We uncovered that only some embryos tolerated equalization, and that there was a size asymmetry threshold for viability. Cell lineage analysis of equalized embryos revealed an array of defects, including faster cell cycle progression in P1 descendants, as well as defects in cell positioning, division orientation and cell fate. Moreover, equalized embryos were more susceptible to external compression. Overall, we conclude that unequal first cleavage is essential for invariably successful embryonic development of C. elegans.",

    "abstract": "In acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the stromal microenvironment plays a prominent role in promoting tumor cell survival and progression. Although widely explored, the crosstalk between leukemic and stromal cells remains poorly understood. Syntenin, a multi-domain PDZ protein, controls both the trafficking and signaling of key molecules involved in intercellular communication. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the role of environmental syntenin in the progression of AML. By in vivo approaches in syngeneic mice, we demonstrate that a syntenin-deficient environment reprograms AML blasts to survive independently of the stroma. Up-regulation of EEF1A2 in the blasts controls this gain of cell survival. Furthermore, using ex vivo co-culture systems, we show that syntenin-deficient bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) enhance the survival of different types of AML cells, including patient samples, and suffice to educate syngeneic AML, recapitulating micro-environmental effects observed in vivo. We establish that syntenin-deficiency causes an increase of eIF5A and autophagy-related factors in BMSC, and provide evidence that the inhibition of autophagy prevents syntenin-deficient BMSC to stimulate AML survival. Altogether, these findings indicate that host-syntenin in the BM microenvironment acts as a repressor of AML aggressiveness.\n\nKey points- A syntenin-deficient host reprograms AML blasts, enhancing total protein synthesis and cell survival pathways\n- Autophagy in the syntenin-deficient microenvironment is responsible for the gain of AML cell survival",

    "abstract": "Signal recognition particle (SRP) is critical for delivering co-translational proteins to the bacterial inner membrane. Previously, we identified SRP suppressors in Escherichia coli that inhibit translation initiation and elongation, which provided insights into the mechanism of bypassing the requirement of SRP. Suppressor mutations tended to be located in regions that govern protein translation under evolutionary pressure. To test this hypothesis, we re-executed the suppressor screening of SRP. Here we isolated a novel SRP suppressor mutation located in the Shine-Dalgarno sequence of the S10 operon, which partially offset the targeting defects of SRP-dependent proteins. We found that the suppressor mutation decreased the protein translation rate, which extended the time window of protein targeting. This increased the possibility of the correct localization of inner membrane proteins. Furthermore, the fidelity of translation was decreased in suppressor cells, suggesting that the quality control of translation was inactivated to provide an advantage in tolerating toxicity caused by the loss of SRP. Our results demonstrated that the inefficient protein targeting due to SRP deletion can be rescued through modulating translational speed and accuracy.",

    "abstract": "TAX1BP1 is a selective autophagy receptor which inhibits NF-{kappa}B and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling to prevent excessive inflammation and maintain homeostasis. Selective autophagy receptors such as p62/SQSTM1 and OPTN are phosphorylated by the noncanonical I{kappa}B kinase TBK1 to stimulate their selective autophagy function. However, it is unknown if TAX1BP1 is regulated by TBK1 or other kinases under basal conditions or during RNA virus infection. Here, we found that the noncanonical I{kappa}B kinases TBK1 and IKKi phosphorylate TAX1BP1 to regulate its basal turnover, whereas the canonical I{kappa}B kinase IKK and the core autophagy factor ATG9 play essential roles in RNA virus-mediated TAX1BP1 autophagosomal degradation. TAX1BP1 phosphorylation by canonical and noncanonical I{kappa}B kinases promotes its localization to lysosomes resulting in its degradation. Furthermore, TAX1BP1 plays a critical role in the clearance of MAVS aggregates, and phosphorylation of TAX1BP1 augments its MAVS aggrephagy function. Together, our data support a model whereby I{kappa}B kinases license TAX1BP1 selective autophagy function to inhibit MAVS and RLR signaling.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) pathway induces type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines in response to RNA virus infection. MAVS is a mitochondrial adaptor protein in the RLR pathway that forms prion-like aggregates upon activation; however, how MAVS aggregates are cleared to restore homeostasis is unclear. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway important for the clearance of potentially cytotoxic protein aggregates that could induce inflammation and/or cell death. TAX1BP1 is a selective autophagy receptor that inhibits RLR signaling, but the precise mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we found that TAX1BP1 is a substrate for multi-site phosphorylation by canonical and noncanonical I{kappa}B kinases which triggered its lysosomal localization and degradation. We also found that TAX1BP1 was critical for the clearance of MAVS aggregates in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Overall, our data suggest that phosphorylation serves a key regulatory function for TAX1BP1 to inhibit RLR signaling.",

    "abstract": "Major developments have been made in the past many years to characterize and explore potential vaccine candidates that can induce host immune responses against parasite. These advances were based on the fact that the induction of host immune responses could effectively target parasite at different stages of its life cycle and thus, abrogate Plasmodium infections. The role of T-cells against malaria comes from initial studies on rodents showing these cells could inhibit parasite development during pre-erythrocytic stages. Since then, the importance of the cellular immune responses against malaria has been increasingly emphasized, especially for vaccine development against pre-erythrocytic stages. Previous work in our laboratory has confirmed that SLTRiP confers protection against the pre-erythrocytic stage of Plasmodium growth in rodents. Here we report that the protection is mainly due to cell mediated immune responses and PbSLTRiP specific cellular memory responses could be efficiently recalled in mice challenged with P. berghei parasites even after a year following immunization. Our results thereby, highlight the role of the T cell response involved in protection. Characterization of T-cells by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) revealed that the induced T cells were polyfunctional and involved in secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines which mediate anti-parasitic activity. The findings contribute to our understanding of the immunological mechanisms underlying the protective vaccines.",

    "abstract": "The rise in obesity prevalence has created an urgent need for new and improved methods to study human adipocytes and the pathogenic effects of weight gain in vitro. Despite numerous studies showing the advantages of culturing adipocyte progenitors as 3D structures, the majority continue using traditional 2D cultures which result in small, multilocular adipocytes with poor representability. We hypothesized that providing differentiating pre-adipocytes with a vascular growth niche would mimic in vivo adipogenesis and improve the differentiation process. Here we present a simple, easily applicable culture protocol that allows for the differentiation and culturing of human adipocytes with a more unilocular morphology and larger lipid droplets than previous protocols. We moreover offer a protocol for inducing adipocyte enlargement in vitro, resulting in larger lipid droplets and development of several key features of adipocyte dysfunction, including altered adipokine secretions and impaired lipolysis. Taken together, our hypertrophied human adipocyte spheroids offer an improved culture system for studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms causing metabolic dysfunction and inflammation during weight gain.",

    "abstract": "High turnover tissues continually lose specialized cells that are replaced by stem cell activity. In the adult mammalian epidermis, it is unclear how molecularly heterogenous stem/progenitor cell populations fit into the complete trajectory of epidermal differentiation. We show that differentiation, from commitment to exit from the stem cell layer, is a multi-day process wherein cells transit through a continuum of transcriptional changes. Differentiation-committed cells remain capable of dividing to produce daughter cells fated to further differentiate, demonstrating that differentiation is uncoupled from cell cycle exit. These cell divisions are not required as part of an obligate transit amplifying program but instead protect density in the stem cell layer. Thus, instead of distinct contributions from multiple progenitors, a continuous gradual differentiation process fuels homeostatic epidermal turnover.\n\nOne sentence summaryHeterogeneity in the epidermal stem cell layer reflects a gradual differentiation program that is uncoupled from the loss of proliferative capacity.",
