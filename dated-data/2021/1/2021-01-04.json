    "abstract": "Probiotics are living microorganisms that are increasingly and successfully used for the therapy of various diseases. The most common use of probiotics is the therapeutic and preventive application for gastrointestinal disorders. The probiotic Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN) has been proven to effectively prevent and alleviate intestinal diseases, including various types of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the widespread medical application of EcN, the underlying mechanisms of its protective effect remain elusive. The present work aimed to establish an insect model system to enable further research on the modes of action of EcN and the dynamics of adaptation to a novel host organism. Using a long-term serial passage approach, we orally introduced EcN to the host, the red flour beetle Tribolium castaneum. After multiple cycles of intestinal colonization in beetle larvae, several attributes of the passaged replicate lines were assessed. We observed phenotypic changes in growth and motility but no genetic changes in the lines after passaging through the host and its flour environment. One of the EcN lines exposed to the host displayed peculiar morphological and physiological characteristics showing that serial passage of EcN can generate differential phenotypes.",
