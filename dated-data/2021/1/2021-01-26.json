    "abstract": "Morphological brain networks, in particular those at the individual level, have become an important approach for studying the human brain connectome; however, relevant methodology is far from being well-established in their formation, description and reproducibility. Here, we extended our previous study by constructing and characterizing single-subject morphological similarity networks from brain volume to surface space and systematically evaluated their reproducibility with respect to effects of different choices of morphological index, brain parcellation atlas and similarity measure, sample size-varying stability and test-retest reliability. Using the Human Connectome Project dataset, we found that surface-based single-subject morphological similarity networks shared common small-world organization, high parallel efficiency, modular architecture and bilaterally distributed hubs regardless of different analytical strategies. Nevertheless, quantitative values of all interregional similarities, global network measures and nodal centralities were significantly affected by choices of morphological index, brain parcellation atlas and similarity measure. Moreover, the morphological similarity networks varied along with the number of participants and approached stability until the sample size exceeded [~]70. Using an independent test-retest dataset, we found fair to good, even excellent, reliability for most interregional similarities and network measures, which were also modulated by different analytical strategies, in particular choices of morphological index. Specifically, fractal dimension and sulcal depth outperformed gyrification index and cortical thickness, higher-resolution atlases outperformed lower-resolution atlases, and Jensen-Shannon divergence-based similarity outperformed Kullback-Leibler divergence-based similarity. Altogether, our findings propose surface-based single-subject morphological similarity networks as a reliable method to characterize the human brain connectome and provide methodological recommendations and guidance for future research.",

    "abstract": "Recent resting-state fMRI studies have shown that brain activity exhibits temporal variations in functional connectivity by using various approaches including sliding window correlation, co-activation patterns, independent component analysis, quasi-periodic patterns, and hidden Markov models. These methods often model the brain activity as a discretized hopping among several brain states that are defined by the spatial configurations of network activity. However, the discretized states are merely a simplification of what is likely to be a continuous process, where each network evolves over time following its unique path. To model these characteristic spatiotemporal trajectories, we trained a variational autoencoder using rs-fMRI data and evaluated the spatiotemporal features of the latent variables obtained from the trained networks. Our results suggest that there are a relatively small number of approximately orthogonal whole-brain spatiotemporal patterns that capture the most prominent features of rs-fMRI data, which can serve as the building blocks to construct all possible spatiotemporal dynamics in resting state fMRI. These spatiotemporal patterns provide insight into how activity flows across the brain in concordance with known network structures and functional connectivity gradients.",

    "abstract": "Recently, ProFAT and BATLAS scores have been offered to determine thermogenic status of adipocytes using expression pattern of brown and white marker-genes. In this work, we investigated the functional context of these genes. Although the two meta-analyses based marker-gene lists have little overlap, their enriched pathways show strong coincides suggesting they may better characterize adipocytes. We demonstrate that functional genomics of the annotated genes in common pathways enables an extended analysis of thermogenesis regulation, generates testable hypotheses supported by experimental results in human adipocytes with different browning potential and may lead to more global conclusions than single-state studies. Our results imply that different biological processes shape brown and white adipocytes with presumed transitional states. We propose that the thermogenic adipocyte phenotype require both repression of whitening and induction of browning. These simultaneous actions and hitherto unnoticed regulatory modules, such as the exemplified HIF1A that may directly act at UCP1 promoter, can set new direction in obesity research.\n\nHighlightsO_LIIntegrated pathways better characterize brown adipocytes than marker-genes\nC_LIO_LIDifferent processes shape the brown and white adipocyte phenotypes\nC_LIO_LIThermogenic phenotype may require simultaneous repression of whitening and induction of browning\nC_LIO_LIProtein network analyses reveals unnoticed regulatory modules of adipocyte phenotype\nC_LIO_LIHIF1A may regulate thermogenesis by direct control of UCP1 gene-expression\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=186 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/428057v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (75K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@b4c730org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@813b58org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5f3398org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@344eb5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "microRNAs regulate a myriad of physiological processes, including skeletal muscle regeneration and homeostasis. During ageing, changes in muscle fibre microenvironment contribute to the capability of satellite cells to regenerate the muscle in response to injury and loading stressors. In this study, we isolated murine satellite cells and primary myogenic progenitors from mice and humans to demonstrate that the microRNA miR-24-3p and its target peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) play an important role in muscle regeneration during ageing, regulating satellite cell viability and their differentiation potential. Our results show upregulation of miR-24 during early stages of muscle regeneration in vivo in adult mice, suggesting a potential role of miR-24 at the early stages of muscle injury. On contrary, miR-24 was downregulated during regeneration of muscle of old mice. miR-24 was also downregulated, whereas its target gene Prdx6 was upregulated, in satellite cells isolated from old mice. miR-24 consistently regulated viability and myogenic potential of myogenic progenitors from both humans and old mice, suggesting that changes in miR-24 levels during ageing may contribute to defective early stages of muscle regeneration during ageing through affecting satellite cell viability and myogenic potential. This regulation likely occurs via miR-24 counteracting the generation of reactive oxygen species through Prdx6 de-repression in primary myogenic progenitors isolated from humans and old mice. We propose that downregulation of miR-24 in muscle of old mice following injury may be a protective mechanism against elevated ROS levels to maintain satellite cell viability and myogenic potential, acting through Prdx6 upregulation. However, as miR-24 is a regulator of p16 and p21, this downregulation may lead to increased satellite cell senescence, therefore representing an age-related failed compensatory mechanism.",

    "abstract": "The ability to control transgene expression, both spatially and temporally, is essential for studying model organisms. In Drosophila, spatial control is primarily provided by the GAL4/UAS system, whilst temporal control relies on a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (which inhibits GAL4) and drug-inducible systems. However, these are not ideal. Shifting temperature can impact on many physiological and behavioural traits, and the current drug-inducible systems are either leaky, toxic, incompatible with existing GAL4-driver lines, or do not generate effective levels of expression. Here we describe the Auxin-inducible Gene Expression System (AGES). AGES relies on the auxin-dependent degradation of a ubiquitously expressed GAL80, and therefore, is compatible with existing GAL4-driver lines. Water-soluble auxin is added to fly food at a low, non-lethal, concentration, which induces expression comparable to uninhibited GAL4 expression. The system works in both larvae and adults, providing a stringent, non-lethal, cost-effective, and convenient method for temporally controlling GAL4 activity in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "Genotyping mistakes represent a challenge in parental assignment where even small errors can lead to significant amounts of unassigned siblings. Different parental assignment algorithms have been designed to approach this problem. The Exclusion method is the most applied for its reliability and biological meaning. However, the resolving power of this method is the lowest for data containing genotyping errors. We introduce a new distance-based approach which we coin as Distance-Based Exclusion (DBE). The DBE method calculates the distance between the offspring haplotype and haplotype of each of the potential fathers. The father with the lowest distance is then assigned as candidate father according to a distance ratio (). We have tested the Exclusion and DBE methods using a real dataset of 1230 offsprings subdivided into families of 25 individuals. Each family had six potential fathers and one known mother. Compared with the Exclusion method, the DBE method is able to solve 4.7% more individuals (64.4% Exclusion vs 69.1% DBE) using the most restrictive  tested without errors. DBE method can also be used together with the Exclusion method for error calculation and to further solve unassigned individuals. Using a two-step approach, we were able to assign 98.1% of the offsprings with a total predicted error of 4.7%. Considering the results obtained, we propose the use of the DBE method in combination with the Exclusion method for parental assignment.",

    "abstract": "PurposeNext generation sequencing has expanded our understanding of many disease processes, including trauma and critical illness. Many studies focus identifying a small set of genes or proteins that are aberrantly expressed. Our objective was to determine whether global differences in pre-mRNA processing entropy, or disorder, could offer novel insights in the setting of critical illness.\n\nMethodsWe used an established murine model of trauma that consisted of hemorrhagic shock and cecal ligation and puncture. In our first experiment mice exposed to trauma were compared to controls. In our second experiment, survival 14 days after exposure to trauma was studied. Using deep RNA sequencing we determined entropy values for every pre-mRNA processing event identified. We then used principal component analysis (PCA) to conduct unsupervised classification of the data.\n\nResultsMice exposed to trauma separated from controls using PCA. Similarly, mice that did not survive 14 days post exposure clustered closely together on PCA.\n\nConclusionOur results suggest that there is a substantial difference in global pre-mRNA processing entropy in mice exposed to trauma vs. controls, and that pre-mRNA processing entropy may be helpful in predicting mortality. The method introduced here is easily transferrable to other disease processes and samples.",

Fundamental differences and limitations among various platforms impact the time, the cost and the accuracy for sequencing whole genomes. Here we designed a complete de novo plant genome generation workflow that starts from plant tissue samples and produces high-quality draft genomes with relatively modest laboratory and bioinformatic resources within seven days. To optimize our workflow we selected different species of plants which were used to extract high molecular weight DNA, to make PacBio and ONT libraries for sequencing with the Sequel I, Sequel II and GridION platforms. We assembled high-quality draft genomes of two different Eucalyptus species E. rudis, and E. camaldulensis to chromosome level without using additional scaffolding technologies. For the rapid production of de novo genome assembly of plant species we showed that our DNA extraction protocol followed by PacBio high fidelity sequencing, and assembly with new generation assemblers such as hifiasm produce excellent results. Our findings will be a valuable benchmark for groups planning wet- and dry-lab plant genomics research and for high throughput plant genomics initiatives.",

    "abstract": "Dioecious plants possess diverse sex determination systems and unique mechanisms of reproductive organ development; however, little is known about how sex-linked genes shape the expression of regulatory cascades that lead to developmental differences between sexes. In Silene latifolia, a dioecious plant with stable dimorphism in floral traits, early experiments suggested that female-regulator genes act on the factors that determine the boundaries of the flower whorls. To identify these regulators, we sequenced the transcriptome of male flowers with fully developed gynoecia induced by rapid demethylation in the parental generation. As the hermaphrodite flower trait is holandric (transmitted only from male to male, inherited on the Y chromosome), we screened for genes that are differentially expressed between male, female, and hermaphrodite flowers. Dozens of candidate genes that are upregulated in hermaphrodite flowers compared to male and female flowers were detected and found to have putative roles in floral organization, affecting the expression of floral MADS-box and other genes. Amongst these genes, eight candidates were found to promote gynoecium formation in female and hermaphrodite flowers, affecting organ size, whorl boundary, and the expression of mainly B class flower genes. To complement our transcriptome analysis, we closely examined the floral organs in their native state using a field emission environmental scanning electron microscope. Our results reveal the principal regulatory pathways involved in sex-specific flower development in the classical model of dioecy, S. latifolia.",

MHA1L enhances accumulation of an ACD6 complex, thereby increasing activity of the ACD6 standard allele for regulating plant growth and defenses. ACD6 is a multipass transmembrane protein with intracellular ankyrin repeats that are structurally similar to those found in mammalian ion channels.

ABCB4 and PIN2 from Arabidopsis thaliana expressed in human embryonic kidney cells displayed electrogenic activity when CsCl-based electrolytes were used. Current-voltage (I-V) analysis of the activities and modeling the effects of adding the auxin anion (IAA-) as a potential substrate with the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation, demonstrated that ABCB4 and PIN2 were 9-fold and 10-fold more selective for IAA- than Cl-, respectively. Thus, these proteins directly transport IAA-, which was not unequivocally established by previous auxin retention assays. Co-expression of ABCB4 and PIN2 produced an especially significant result. Co-expression synergistically doubled the selectivity for IAA-. An area of two-fold higher selectivity for IAA- that this result indicates will occur in cells with asymmetric PIN2 and symmetric ABCB4 matches what early models found to be necessary to create observed levels of polar auxin transport through tissues. Thus, the requirement for two different proteins appears to be explained by a synergistic effect on selectivity. More substrate details and important pharmacological results are reported.",

The DNA plasmid construct was transformed into E. coli cells for large scale production. The immunogenicity potential of the plasmid DNA has been evaluated in mice, guinea pig, and rabbit models by intradermal route at 25, 100 and 500g dose. Based on the animal studies proof-of-concept has been established and preclinical toxicology (PCT) studies were conducted in rat and rabbit model. Preliminary animal study demonstrates that the candidate DNA vaccine induces antibody response including neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and also provided Th-1 response as evidenced by elevated IFN-{gamma} levels.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of the origin and reservoir of the coronavirus responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is still fragmentary. To date, the closest relatives to SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in Rhinolophus bats sampled in the Yunnan province, China. Here we describe the identification of SARS-CoV-2 related coronaviruses in two Rhinolophus shameli bats sampled in Cambodia in 2010. Metagenomic sequencing identified nearly identical viruses sharing 92.6% nucleotide identity with SARS-CoV-2. Most genomic regions are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, with the exception of a small region corresponding to the spike N terminal domain. The discovery of these viruses in a bat species not found in China indicates that SARS-CoV-2 related viruses have a much wider geographic distribution than previously understood, and suggests that Southeast Asia represents a key area to consider in the ongoing search for the origins of SARS-CoV-2, and in future surveillance for coronaviruses.",

    "abstract": "New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are being reported worldwide. More specifically, the variants reported in South Africa (501Y.V2) and United Kingdom (B.1.1.7) were found to be more contagious than the wild type. There are also speculations that the variants might evade the host immune responses induced by currently available vaccines and develop resistance to drugs under consideration. The first step of viral infection in COVID-19, occurs through the interaction of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein with peptidase domain of the human ACE-2 (hACE-2) receptor. So, possibly the mutations in the RBD domain of spike protein in the new variants could modulate the protein-protein interaction with hACE-2 receptor leading to the increased virulence. In this study, we aim to get molecular level understanding into the mechanism behind the increased infection rate due to such mutations in these variants. We have computationally studied the interaction of the spike protein in both wild-type and B.1.1.7 variant with hACE-2 receptor using combined molecular dynamics and binding free energy calculations using molecular mechanics-Generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) approach. The binding free energies computed using configurations from minimization run and low temperature simulation show that mutant variant of spike protein has increased binding affinity for hACE-2 receptor (i.e. {Delta}{Delta}G(N501Y,A570D) is in the range -20.4 to -21.4 kcal/mol)The residue-wise decomposition analysis and intermolecular hydrogen bond analysis evidenced that the N501Y mutation has increased interaction between RBD of spike protein with ACE-2 receptor. We have also carried out calculations using density functional theory and the results evidenced the increased interaction between three pairs of residues (TYR449 (spike)-ASP38 (ACE-2), TYR453-HIE34 and TYR501-LYS353) in the variant that could be attributed to its increased virulence. The free energies of wild-type and mutant variants of the spike protein computed from MM-GBSA approach suggests that latter variant is stable by about -10.4 kcal/mol when compared to wild type suggesting that it will be retained in the evolution due to increased stability. We demonstrate that with the use of the state-of-the art of computational approaches, we can in advance predict the more virulent nature of variants of SARS-CoV-2 and alert the world health-care system.",

    "abstract": "Transient receptor potential canonical type 5 (TRPC5) channels are expressed in the brain and kidney, and have been identified as promising therapeutic targets whose selective inhibition can protect against diseases driven by a leaky kidney filter. They are activated by elevated levels of extracellular Ca2+ or application of lanthanide ions but also by G protein (Gq/11) stimulation. Phosphatidylinositol bis-phosphate (PIP2) hydrolysis leads to protein kinase C- (PKC-) mediated phosphorylation of TRPC5 channels and desensitization of their activity. Even though PIP2 regulation of TRP channels is being widely studied, the roles of PIP2 in maintaining TRPC5 channel activity, the PIP2 involvement in channel stimulation by its hydrolysis product diacyl glycerol (DAG), or the desensitization of activity by DAG-stimulated PKC activity remain unclear. Here, we show that PIP2 controls both the PKC-mediated inhibition of TRPC5 currents as well as the activation by DAG and lanthanides and that it accomplishes this through control of gating rather than channel cell surface density. The mechanistic insights achieved by the present work promise to aid in the development of more selective and precise molecules to block TRPC5 channel activity and illuminate new therapeutic opportunities for targeted therapies for a group of diseases for which there is currently a great unmet need.",

    "abstract": "IntroductionNeuroimaging measurements of brain structural integrity are thought to be surrogates for brain health, but precise assessments require dedicated advanced image acquisitions. By means of describing the texture of conventional images beyond what meets the naked eye, radiomic analyses hold potential for evaluating brain health. We sought to: 1) evaluate this novel approach to assess brain structural integrity by predicting white matter hyperintensities burdens (WMH) and 2) uncover associations between predictive radiomic features and patients clinical phenotypes.\n\nMethodsOur analyses were based on a multi-site cohort of 4,163 acute ischemic strokes (AIS) patients with T2-FLAIR MR images and corresponding deep-learning-generated total brain and WMH segmentation. Radiomic features were extracted from normal-appearing brain tissue (brain mask-WMH mask). Radiomics-based prediction of personalized WMH burden was done using ElasticNet linear regression. We built a radiomic signature of WMH with the most stable selected features predictive of WMH burden and then related this signature to clinical variables (age, sex, hypertension (HTN), atrial fibrillation (AF), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease (CAD), and history of smoking) using canonical correlation analysis.\n\nResultsRadiomic features were highly predictive of WMH burden (R2=0.855{+/-}0.011). Seven pairs of canonical variates (CV) significantly correlated the radiomics signature of WMH and clinical traits with respective canonical correlations of 0.81, 0.65, 0.42, 0.24, 0.20, 0.15, and 0.15 (FDR-corrected p-valuesCV1-6<.001, p-valueCV7=.012). The clinical CV1 was mainly influenced by age, CV2 by sex, CV3 by history of smoking and DM, CV4 by HTN, CV5 by AF and DM, CV6 by CAD, and CV7 by CAD and DM.\n\nConclusionRadiomics extracted from T2-FLAIR images of AIS patients capture microstructural damage of the cerebral parenchyma and correlate with clinical phenotypes. Further research could evaluate radiomics to predict the progression of WMH.\n\nResearch in contextO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSWe did a systematic review on PubMed until December 1, 2020, for original articles and reviews in which radiomics were used to characterize stroke or cerebrovascular diseases. Radiomic analyses cover a broad ensemble of high-throughput quantification methods applicable to digitalized medical images that extract high-dimensional data by describing a given region of interest by its size, shape, histogram, and relationship between voxels. We used the search terms \"radiomics\" or \"texture analysis\", and \"stroke\", \"cerebrovascular disease\", \"small vessel disease\", or \"white matter hyperintensities\". Our research identified 24 studies, 18 studying radiomics of stroke lesions and 6 studying cerebrovascular diseases. All the latter six studies were based on MRI (T1-FLAIR, dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging, T1 & T2-FLAIR, T2-FLAIR post-contrast, T2-FLAIR, and T2-TSE images). Four studies were describing small vessel disease, and two were predicting longitudinal progression of WMH. The average sample size was small with 96 patients included (maximum: 204). One study on 141 patients identified 7 T1-FLAIR radiomic features correlated with cardiovascular risk factors (age and hyperlipidemia) using univariate correlations. All studies were monocentric and performed on a single MRI scanner.\n\nAdded value of this studyTo date and to the best of our knowledge, this is the largest radiomics study performed on cerebrovascular disease or any topic, and one of the very few to include a great diversity of participating sites with diverse clinical MRI scanners. This study is the first one to establish a radiomic signature of WMH and to interpret its relationship with common cardiovascular risk factors. Our findings add to the body of evidence that damage caused by small vessel disease extend beyond the visible white matter hyperintensities, but the added value resides in the detection of that subvisible damage on routinely acquired T2-FLAIR imaging. It also suggests that cardiovascular phenotypes might manifest in distinct textural patterns detectable on conventional clinical-grade T2-FLAIR images.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceAssessing brain structural integrity has implications for treatment selection, follow-up, prognosis, and recovery prediction in stroke patients but also other neurological disease populations. Measuring cerebral parenchymal structural integrity usually requires advanced imaging such as diffusion tensor imaging or functional MRI. Translation of those neuroimaging biomarkers remains uncommon in clinical practice mainly because of their time-consuming and costly acquisition. Our study provides a potential novel solution to assess brains structural integrity applicable to standard, routinely acquired T2-FLAIR imaging.\n\nFuture research could, for instance, benchmark this radiomics approach against diffusion or functional MRI metrics in the prediction of cognitive or functional outcomes after stroke.",

Approximately 3% of recovered patients demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity, defining them as  elite neutralizers. These individuals also possessed effective cross-neutralizing IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-1 without any known prior exposure to this virus. By applying multivariate statistical modeling, we found that sero-reactivity, age, time since disease onset, and fever are key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing activity in mild courses of COVID-19. Investigating longevity of the antibody response, we detected loss of anti-spike reactivity in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Moreover, neutralizing activity had an initial half-life of 6.7 weeks in serum versus 30.8 weeks in purified IgG samples indicating the presence of a more stable and long-term memory IgG B cell repertoire in the majority of individuals recovered from COVID-19. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum of the initial SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody response depending on clinical characteristics, with antibodies being maintained in the majority of individuals for the first 10 months after mild course of COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Winter carbon loss in northern ecosystems is estimated to be greater than the average growing season carbon uptake. However, most ecosystem carbon measurements neglect winter months since carbon losses (primarily driven by microbial decomposers) are assumed to be negligible at low temperatures. We used stable isotope probing (SIP) targeted metagenomics to reveal the genomic potential of active soil microbial populations under winter conditions, with an emphasis on viruses and virus-host dynamics. Peat soils from the Bonanza Creek LTER site in Alaska were incubated under subzero anoxic conditions with H218O for 184 and 370 days. We identified 46 bacterial populations (MAGs; spanning 9 bacterial phyla) and 243 viral populations (vOTUs) that actively took up 18O and produced significant CO2 throughout the incubation. Active hosts, predicted for 33% of the active vOTUs, were some of the most abundant MAGs and capable of fermentation and organic matter degradation. Approximately three-quarters of the active vOTUs carried auxiliary metabolic genes that spanned five functional categories, including carbon utilization, highlighting the potential impact of viruses in this peat soils microbial biogeochemistry. These results illustrate significant bacterial and viral activity and interactions occur in frozen soils, revealing viruses are a major community-structuring agent throughout winter months.",

    "abstract": "A one-step reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) test was developed for rapid screening (40 minutes) of the Spike N501Y and HV69-70del mutations in SARS-CoV-2 positive samples. The test also targets a conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 Orf1ab as an internal control. The samples containing both the N501Y and HV69-70del mutations are concluded as VOC-202012/01 positive. Samples suspected to be positive for B.1.351 or P.1 are the N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative cases. Limit of detection (LOD) of the kit for Orf1ab target is 500 copies/mL, while that of the N501, Y501 and HV69-70del targets are 5000 copies/mL. The developed assay was applied to 165 clinical samples containing SARS-CoV-2 from 32 different lineages. The SARS-CoV-2 lineages were determined via the next-generation sequencing (NGS). The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the NGS results that 19 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del positive, 10 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 1 sample was N501Y negative and HV69-70del positive, and 135 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. All the VOC-202012/01 positive samples were detected in people who have traveled from England to Turkey. The RT-qPCR test and the Sanger sequencing was further applied to 1000 SARS-CoV-2 positive clinical samples collected in Jan2021 from the 81 different provinces of Turkey. The RT-qPCR results were in 100% agreement with the Sanger sequencing results that 32 samples were N501Y positive and HV69-70del negative, 4 samples were N501Y negative and HV69-70del positive, 964 samples were N501Y and HV69-70del negative. The specificity of the 40 minutes RT-qPCR assay relative to the sequencing-based technologies is 100%. The developed assay is an advantageous tool for timely and representative estimation of the N501Y positive variants prevalence because it allows testing a much higher portion of the SARS-CoV-2 positives in much lower time compared to the sequencing-based technologies.",

    "abstract": "As the most abundant and diverse form of life on Earth, microorganisms commonly inhabit energy-limited environments where cellular maintenance and growth is highly constrained. To gain insight into how microorganisms persist under such conditions, we derived demographic parameters from a diverse collection of bacteria by censusing 100 populations in a closed system for 1,000 days. All but one taxon survived prolonged resource scarcity, yielding estimated times-to-extinction ranging over four orders of magnitude from 100 - 105 years. These findings corroborate reports of long-lived bacteria that have been recovered from ancient environmental samples, while providing insight into mechanisms of persistence. Critically, we found that as death rates declined over time, lifespan was extended through the scavenging of dead cells. Although growth and reproduction were dramatically suppressed in the absence of an exogenous resource supply, bacterial populations continued to evolve. Hundreds of mutations were acquired, contributing to genome-wide signatures of negative selection as well as molecular signals of adaptation. Remarkable consistency in the ecological and evolutionary dynamics indicate that distantly related bacteria respond to energy-limitation in a similar and predictable manner, which likely contributes to the stability and robustness of microbial life.",

    "abstract": "Integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) are mobile genetic elements capable of transferring their own and other DNA. They contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistances and other important traits for bacterial evolution. Exclusion is a mechanism used by many conjugative plasmids and a few ICEs to prevent their host cell from acquiring a second copy of the cognate element. ICEBs1 of Bacillus subtilis has an exclusion mechanism whereby the exclusion protein YddJ in a potential recipient inhibits the activity of the ICEBs1-encoded conjugation machinery in a potential donor. The target of YddJ-mediated exclusion is the conjugation protein ConG (a VirB6 homolog). Here we defined the regions of YddJ and ConG that confer exclusion specificity and determined the importance of exclusion to host cells. Using chimeras that had parts of ConG from ICEBs1 and the closely related ICEBat1 we identified a putative extracellular loop of ConG that conferred specificity for exclusion by the cognate YddJ. Using chimeras of YddJ from ICEBs1 and ICEBat1 we identified two regions in YddJ needed for exclusion specificity. We also found that YddJ-mediated exclusion reduced death of donor cells following conjugation into recipients. Donor death was dependent on the ability of transconjugants to themselves become donors and was reduced under osmo-protective conditions, indicating that death was likely due to alterations in the donor cell envelope caused by excessive conjugation. We postulate that elements that can have high frequencies of transfer likely evolved exclusion mechanisms to protect the host cells from excessive death.\n\nImportanceHorizontal gene transfer is a driving force in bacterial evolution, responsible for the spread of many traits, including antibiotic and heavy metal resistances. Conjugation, one type of horizontal gene transfer, involves DNA transfer from donor to recipient cells through conjugation machinery and direct cell-cell contact. Exclusion mechanisms allow conjugative elements to prevent their host from acquiring additional copies of the element, and are highly specific enabling hosts to acquire heterologous elements. We defined regions of the exclusion protein and its target in the conjugation machinery that convey high specificity of exclusion. We found that exclusion protects donors from cell death during periods of high transfer. This is likely important for the element to enter new populations of cells.",

To date, no study has examined the impact of pre-existing DENV immunity on ZIKV pathogenesis during pregnancy in a translational non-human primate model. Here we show that prior DENV-2 exposure enhanced ZIKV infection of maternal-fetal interface tissues in macaques. However, pre-existing DENV immunity had no detectable impact on ZIKV replication kinetics in maternal plasma, and all pregnancies progressed to term without adverse outcomes or gross fetal abnormalities detectable at delivery. Understanding the risks of ADE to pregnant women worldwide is critical as vaccines against DENV and ZIKV are developed and licensed and as DENV and ZIKV continue to circulate.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa explores surfaces using twitching motility powered by retractile extracellular filaments called type IV pili. Single cells twitch by successive pili extension, attachment and retraction. However, whether and how single cells control twitching migration remains unclear. We discovered that P. aeruginosa actively directs twitching in the direction of mechanical input from type IV pili, in a process we call mechanotaxis. The Chp chemotaxis-like system controls the balance of forward and reverse twitching migration of single cells in response to the mechanical signal. On surfaces, Chp senses type IV pili attachment at one pole thereby sensing a spatially-resolved signal. As a result, the Chp response regulators PilG and PilH control the polarization of the extension motor PilB. PilG stimulates polarization favoring forward migration, while PilH inhibits polarization inducing reversal. Subcellular segregation of PilG and PilH efficiently orchestrates their antagonistic functions, ultimately enabling rapid reversals upon perturbations. This distinct localization of response regulators establishes a signaling landscape known as local-excitation, global-inhibition in higher order organisms, identifying a conserved strategy to transduce spatially-resolved signals. Our discovery finally resolves the function of the Chp system and expands our view of the signals regulating motility.",

    "abstract": "The current understanding of organic carbon inputs into ecosystems lacking photosynthetic primary production is predicated on data and inferences derived almost entirely from metagenomic analyses. The elevated abundances of putative chemolithoautotrophs in groundwaters suggest that dark CO2 fixation is an integral component of subsurface trophic webs. To understand the impact of autotrophically-fixed carbon, the flux of CO2-derived carbon through various subpopulations of subsurface microbiota must first be resolved, both quantitatively and temporally. Here, we implement novel stable isotope cluster analysis to render a time-resolved and quantitative evaluation of 13CO-derived carbon flow through a groundwater microbiome stimulated with reduced sulfur compounds. We demonstrate that mixotrophs, not obligate chemolithoautotrophs, were the most abundant active organisms in groundwater microcosms. Species of Hydrogenophaga, Polaromonas, Dechloromonas, and other metabolically versatile mixotrophs drove the recycling of organic carbon and, when chance afforded, supplemented their carbon requirements via chemolithoautotrophy and uptake of available organic compounds. Mixotrophic activity facilitated the replacement of 43 and 80% of total microbial carbon stores with 13C in just 21 and 70 days, respectively. This opportunistic \"utilize whatever pathways net the greatest advantage in fitness\" strategy may explain the great abundances of mixotrophs in other oligotrophic habitats, like the upper ocean and boreal lakes.",

    "abstract": "Erk signaling regulates cellular decisions in many biological contexts. Recently, we have reported a series of Erk activity traveling waves that coordinate regeneration of osteoblast tissue in zebrafish scales. These waves originate from a central source region, propagate as expanding rings, and impart cell growth, thus controlling tissue morphogenesis. Here, we present a minimal reaction-diffusion model for Erk activity waves. The model considers three components: Erk, a diffusible Erk-activator, and an Erk-inhibitor. Erk stimulates both its activator and inhibitor, forming a positive and negative feedback loop, respectively. Our model shows that this system can be excitable and propagate Erk activity waves. Waves originate from a pulsatile source which is modeled by adding a localized basal production of the activator that switches the source region from an excitable to an oscillatory state. As Erk activity periodically rises in the source, it can trigger an excitable wave which travels across the entire tissue. Analysis of the model finds that positive feedback controls the properties of the traveling wavefront and that negative feedback controls the duration of Erk activity peak and the period of Erk activity waves. The geometrical properties of the waves facilitate constraints on the effective diffusivity of the activator, indicating that waves are an efficient mechanism to transfer growth factor signaling rapidly across a large tissue.\n\nSignificance statementSignaling waves represent a possible mechanism of spatiotemporal organization of multicellular tissues. We have recently shown that waves of activity of the kinase Erk control osteoblast regeneration in adult zebrafish scales. Here, we present a detailed characterization of a mathematical model of these signaling waves. We show that a source region poised in an oscillatory state can broadcast traveling waves of Erk activity in the surrounding excitable tissue. The dynamics of the source control the number and frequency of waves. Geometrical arguments support the notion that excitable Erk waves are an effective mechanism to transport growth factor signaling across a large regenerating tissue.",

Many studies overlook the variable effects that species trait differences can have on the direction of competitive exclusion, which reverses depending on the specific mechanism at play. We performed a comprehensive trait-based study of an ant invasion integrating morphological, dietary, physiological and behavioral analyses. We found that trait differences between invasive and resident species were not only associated with niche differences which promoted the coexistence of dissimilar species, but also competitive ability differences which acted in the opposite fashion. Furthermore, competition along separate trait axes led to complex and contrasting patterns in the invaded assemblages, where species were at once similar (clustered) in some traits but also dissimilar (overdispersed) in others. Our results reveal that different aspects of phenotype may distinctly modulate the effect of competition in structuring ecological communities and functional diversity.",

Due to the high zoonotic potential of these viruses, it is critical to unravel their evolutionary history of host species shift, adaptation and emergence. Only such knowledge can guide virus discovery, surveillance and research efforts to identify viruses posing a pandemic risk in humans. We present a comprehensive analysis of the composition and codon usage bias of the 82 Orthocoronavirinae members, infecting 47 different avian and mammalian hosts. Our results clearly establish that synonymous codon usage varies widely among viruses and is only weakly dependent on the type of host they infect. Instead, we identify mutational bias towards AT-enrichment and selection against CpG dinucleotides as the main factors responsible of the codon usage bias variation. Further insight on the mutational equilibrium within Orthocoronavirinae revealed that most coronavirus genomes are close to their neutral equilibrium, the exception is the three recently-infecting human coronaviruses, which lie further away from the mutational equilibrium than their endemic human coronavirus counterparts. Finally, our results suggest that while replicating in humans SARS-CoV-2 is slowly becoming AT-richer, likely until attaining a new mutational equilibrium.",

We performed an integrative analysis on 113 genome-wide significant longevity and 14,529 age-related disease variants in the context of putative gene expression regulation. We found that most of the longevity allele types were different from the genotype of disease alleles when they were localized at the same chromosomal positions. Longevity variants were about eight times more likely to be associated with gene expression than randomly selected variants. The directions of the gene expression association were more likely to be opposite between longevity and disease variants when the association occurred to the same gene. Many longevity variants likely function through down-regulating inflammatory response and up-regulating healthy lipid metabolisms. In conclusion, this work helps to elucidate the potential mechanisms of longevity variants for follow-up studies to discover methods to extend human healthspan.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are a major source of genetic and regulatory variation in their host genome and are consequently thought to play important roles in evolution. Many fungal and oomycete plant pathogens have evolved dynamic and TE-rich genomic regions containing genes that are implicated in host colonization. TEs embedded in these regions have typically been thought to accelerate the evolution of these genomic compartments, but little is known about their dynamics in strains that harbor them. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing data of 42 strains of the fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae to systematically identify polymorphic TEs that may be implicated in genomic as well as in gene expression variation. We identified 2,523 TE polymorphisms and characterize a subset of 8% of the TEs as dynamic elements that are evolutionary younger, less methylated, and more highly expressed when compared with the remaining 92% of the TE complement. As expected, the dynamic TEs are enriched in the dynamic genomic regions. Besides, we observed an association of dynamic TEs with pathogenicity-related genes that localize nearby and that display high expression levels. Collectively, our analyses demonstrate that TE dynamics in V. dahliae contributes to genomic variation, correlates with expression of pathogenicity-related genes, and potentially impacts the evolution of dynamic genomic regions.\n\nSignificance statementTransposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components of genomes and are major sources of genetic and regulatory variation. Many plant pathogens have evolved TE-rich genomic regions containing genes with roles in host colonization, and TEs are thought to contribute to accelerated evolution of these dynamic regions. We analyzed the fungal plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae to identify TE variation between strains and to demonstrate that polymorphic TEs have specific characteristic that separates them from the majority of TEs. Polymorphic TEs are enriched in dynamic genomic regions and are associated with structural variants and highly expressed pathogenicity-related genes. Collectively, our results provide evidence for the hypothesis that dynamic TEs contribute to increased genomic diversity, functional variation, and the evolution of dynamic genomic regions.",

    "abstract": "Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) catalyzes both synthesis and anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). Its catalytic site contains Ni at the core of Cofactor F430. The Ni ion, in its low-valent Ni(I) state lights the fuse leading to homolysis of the C-S bond of methyl-coenzyme M (methyl-SCoM) to generate a methyl radical, which abstracts a hydrogen atom from Coenzyme B (HSCoB) to generate methane and the mixed disulfide CoMSSCoB. Direct reversal of this reaction activates methane to initiate anaerobic methane oxidation. Based on crystal structures, which reveal a Ni-thiol interaction between Ni(II)-MCR and inhibitor CoMSH, a Ni(I)-thioether complex with substrate methyl-SCoM has been transposed to canonical MCR mechanisms. Similarly, a Ni(I)-disulfide with CoMSSCoB is proposed for the reverse reaction. However, this Ni(I)-sulfur interaction poses a conundrum for the proposed hydrogen atom abstraction reaction because the >6 [A] distance between the thiol group of SCoB and the thiol of SCoM observed in the structures appears too long for such a reaction. Spectroscopic, kinetic, structural and computational studies described here establish that both methyl-SCoM and CoMSSCoB bind to the active Ni(I) state of MCR through their sulfonate groups, forming a hexacoordinate Ni(I)-N/O complex, not Ni(I)-S. These studies rule out direct Ni(I)-sulfur interactions in both substrate-bound states. As a solution to the mechanistic conundrum, we propose that both forward and reverse MCR reactions emanate through long-range electron transfer from Ni(I)-sulfonate complexes with methyl-SCoM or CoMSSCoB, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing has enabled metagenomics, the study of the genomes of microorganisms sampled directly from the environment without cultivation. We previously developed a proof-of-concept, scalable metagenome clustering algorithm based on Apache Spark to cluster sequence reads according to their species of origin. To overcome its under-clustering problem on short-read sequences, in this study we developed a new, two-step Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) that first forms clusters of long reads and then recruits short reads to these clusters. Compared to alternative label propagation strategies, this hybrid clustering algorithm (hybrid-LPA) yields significantly larger read clusters without compromising cluster purity. We show that adding an extra clustering step before assembly leads to improved metagenome assemblies, predicting more complete genomes or gene clusters from a synthetic metagenome dataset and a real-world metagenome dataset, respectively. These results suggest that hybrid-LPA is a good alternative to current metagenome assembly practice by providing benefits in both scalability and accuracy on large metagenome datasets.\n\nAvailability and implementationhttps://bitbucket.org/zhong_wang/hybridlpa/src/master/.\n\nContactzhongwang@lbl.gov",

    "abstract": "Single-cell omics assays have become essential tools for identifying and characterizing cell types and states of complex tissues. While each single-modality assay reveals distinctive features about the sequenced cells, true multi-omics assays are still in early stage of development. This notion signifies the importance of computationally integrating single-cell omics data that are conducted on various samples across various modalities. In addition, the advent of multiplexed molecular imaging assays has given rise to a need for computational methods for integrative analysis of single-cell imaging and omics data. Here, we present GLUER (inteGrative anaLysis of mUlti-omics at single-cEll Resolution), a flexible tool for integration of single-cell multi-omics data and imaging data. Using multiple true multi-omics data sets as the ground truth, we demonstrate that GLUER achieved significant improvement over existing methods in terms of the accuracy of matching cells across different data modalities resulting in ameliorating downstream analyses such as clustering and trajectory inference. We further demonstrate the broad utility of GLUER for integrating single-cell transcriptomics data with imaging-based spatial proteomics and transcriptomics data. Finally, we extend GLUER to leverage true cell-pair labels when available in true multi-omics data, and show that this approach improves co-embedding and clustering results. With the rapid accumulation of single-cell multi-omics and imaging data, integrated data holds the promise of furthering our understanding of the role of heterogeneity in development and disease.",

    "abstract": "Ionizing radiation (IR) and chemotherapy are the mainstays of treatment for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Yet, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the success or failure of radiotherapy remain unclear. The transcriptional repressor SNAI2 was previously identified as a key regulator of IR sensitivity in normal and malignant stem cells through its repression of the proapoptotic BH3-only gene PUMA. Here, we demonstrate a clear correlation between SNAI2 expression levels and radiosensitivity across multiple RMS cell lines. Moreover, modulating SNAI2 levels in RMS cells through its overexpression or knockdown can alter radiosensitivity in vitro and in vivo. SNAI2 expression reliably promotes overall cell growth and inhibits mitochondrial apoptosis following exposure to IR, with either variable or minimal effects on differentiation and senescence, respectively. Importantly, SNAI2 knockdown results in a striking increase in expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only gene BIM, and ChIP-seq experiments establish that SNAI2 is a direct repressor of BIM. Since the P53 pathway is nonfunctional in the RMS cells used in this study, we have identified a new, P53-independent SNAI2/BIM axis that could potentially predict clinical responses to IR treatment and be exploited to improve RMS therapy.\n\nHighlightsO_LISNAI2 expression levels are directly correlated with protection from radiation in rhabdomyosarcoma.\nC_LIO_LILoss of SNAI2 primes rhabdomyosarcomas for IR-induced apoptosis.\nC_LIO_LISNAI2 directly represses the expression of the proapoptotic BH3-only gene BIM.\nC_LI",

Single-cell technologies capture important cell-to-cell variability responsible for heterogeneity in biomarker expression that may be overlooked when molecular alterations are based on bulk tissue samples. The aim of this study was to identify novel prognostic biomarkers and describe the heterogeneity of prostate cancer and the associated immune cell infiltrates by simultaneously quantifying 36 proteins using single-cell mass cytometry analysis of over 1,6 million cells from 58 men with localized prostate cancer. To perform this task, we proposed a novel computational pipeline, Franken, which showed unprecedented combination of performance, sensitivity and scalability for high dimensional clustering compared to state of the art methods. We were able to describe subpopulations of immune, stromal, and prostate cells, including unique changes occurring in tumor tissues and high grade disease providing insights into the coordinated progression of prostate cancer. Our results further indicated that men with localized disease already harbor rare subpopulations that typically occur in castration-resistant and metastatic disease, which were confirmed through imaging. Our methodology could be used to discover novel prognostic biomarkers to personalize treatment and improve outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Research has investigated the use of non-invasive brain interventions, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), to enhance motor learning and rehabilitation. Much research has shown that tDCS improves motor learning and that bilateral tDCS is more beneficial than unilateral tDCS in improving motor learning. However, past research has primarily utilised simple motor tasks in measuring motor skill learning. These are not ecologically reliable as whole-body movement is required for everyday activities. This study involved two experiments. Each experiment involved participants learning 12 Ballroom and Latin dance moves whilst undergoing tDCS. All participants underwent three sessions of tDCS, (unilateral, bilateral and sham), over three consecutive days. Participants in the first experiment (n=30) had stimulation to the primary motor cortex (PMC) and those in the second experiment (n=31) had stimulation to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). In each experiment, a baseline was taken before the training sessions and two outcome measures were taken; a day after the last training session and two weeks later. In each testing session participants dance ability was measured. Our results showed that bilateral tDCS impaired performance in both experiments. Unilateral stimulation impaired performance in the first experiment, and did not significantly improve performance any better than the sham stimulation in the second experiment. These results suggest that task complexity plays a crucial role when tDCS procedures are used to modulate motor performance and highlights possible limitations of tDCS in practice.",

    "abstract": "Declarative memory retrieval is thought to rely on the reinstatement, at retrieval, of contextual cues present during encoding, as evidenced in the context and state-dependent literature. Specifically, previous work has shown that reinstating the oscillatory activity present during encoding, at retrieval, is particularly supportive of memory recall. Our study builds on previous findings suggesting that the oscillatory activity present at encoding may be automatically reinstated during retrieval. To explore the roles of consolidation, prefrontal involvement, and frequency specific activity in this process of oscillatory reinstatement, 115 healthy young adults were randomly assigned to one of five conditions. In each condition, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) was administered at either one of two frequencies (60Hz or 6Hz), over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (left-DLPFC, Experimental) or the right primary motor cortex (right-PMC, Control), during learning of written words. This was followed by a retention interval of either 90 minutes or 1 week and a testing phase, during which EEG activity was recorded. Our results showed significant (and frequency specific) oscillatory reinstatement, after stimulation of the left-DLPFC, in the 1-week retention condition. Oscillatory reinstatement effects were non-significant after stimulation of the right-PMC, or in the 90 minutes retention interval condition. Our results highlight that the oscillatory activity induced during encoding is consolidated as context alongside the information and is reinstated intrinsically during retrieval. The implications of our findings for models of human memory, future avenues of research and clinical applications are discussed.",

    "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is triggered by injury to the somatosensory system, and is one of the most important types of chronic pain. Nevertheless, critical pathophysiological mechanisms that maintain neuropathic pain are poorly understood. Here, we show that neuropathic pain is abrogated when the kynurenine metabolic pathway (KYNPATH) initiated by the enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is ablated pharmacologically or genetically. Mechanistically, it was found that IDO upregulation in dendritic cells that accumulate in the dorsal root leptomeninges led to increased levels of kynurenine (Kyn) in the spinal cord, where Kyn is metabolized by astrocytes-expressed kynurenine-3-monooxygenase into a pro-nociceptive metabolite 3-hydroxykynurenine. In conclusion, these data reveal a novel role for KYNPATH as an important factor maintaining neuropathic pain during neuroimmune-glia cells interactions. This novel paradigm offers potential new targets for drug development against this type of chronic pain.",

    "abstract": "Immune responses at the boundary between the host and the world beyond are complex and mucosal tissue homeostasis relies on them. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a syndrome suffered by children with hypertrophied tonsils. We uncovered a crucial role of pro-inflammatory tonsillar B and T cells in sustaining hypertrophy and hyperplasia by producing TNF and IL17, respectively. We detected prominent levels of expression of CD1d by tonsillar stratified as well as reticular epithelium, which have not previously been reported. By combining bacterial culture from the tonsillar core and subsequent identification of the respective isolates, we determined the most prevalent species within the cohort of OSA patients. Although the isolated species are considered normal oropharyngeal commensals in children, we confirmed their capacity to breach the epithelial barrier. Our work shed light on the pathological mechanism underlying OSA, highlighting the relevance taken by the host immune system when defining infection versus colonization.",

    "abstract": "Acetogens play a key role in anaerobic degradation of organic material and in maintaining biogas process efficiency. Profiling this community and its temporal changes can help evaluate process stability and function, especially under disturbance/stress conditions, and avoid complete process failure. The formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene can be used as a marker for acetogenic community profiling in diverse environments. In this study, we developed a new high-throughput FTHFS gene sequencing method for acetogenic community profiling and compared it with conventional T-RFLP of the FTHFS gene, 16S rRNA gene-based profiling of the whole bacterial community, and indirect analysis via 16S rRNA profiling of the FTHFS gene-harbouring community. Analyses and method comparisons were made using samples from two laboratory-scale biogas processes, one operated under stable control and one exposed to controlled overloading disturbance. Comparative analysis revealed satisfactory detection of the bacterial community and its changes for all methods, but with some differences in resolution and taxonomic identification. FTHFS gene sequencing was found to be the most suitable and reliable method to study acetogenic communities. These results pave the way for community profiling in various biogas processes and in other environments where the dynamics of acetogenic bacteria have not been well studied.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=182 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/427894v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14ac78org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1472ea3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@46fc19org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@50ce7a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG ONE SENTENCE SUMMARYOur high-throughput FTHFS gene AmpSeq method for barcoded samples and unsupervised analysis with AcetoScan accurately reveals temporal dynamics of acetogenic community structure in anaerobic digesters.",

For microbial ecology research in cystic fibrosis (CF), different artificial sputum media (ASM) formulations have been created to recapitulate the nutrient availability of the CF lung environment. However, these ASM formulations vary in concentration of amino acids, mucin, and other niche-specific compounds. Here, we measured the differential production of small molecule virulence factors by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the predominant pathogen in CF pulmonary infections, cultured in nine different ASM formulations via liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and molecular networking.

    "abstract": "Sexual systems are highly diverse and have profound consequences for population dynamics and resilience. Yet, little is known about how they evolved. Using phylogenetic Bayesian modelling and a sample of 4614 species, we show that gonochorism is the likely ancestral condition in teleost fish. While all hermaphroditic forms revert quickly to gonochorism, protogyny and simultaneous hermaphroditism are evolutionarily more stable than protandry. In line with theoretical expectations, simultaneous hermaphroditism does not evolve directly from gonochorism but can evolve slowly from sequential hermaphroditism, particularly protandry. We find support for the predictions from life history theory that protogynous, but not protandrous, species live longer than gonochoristic species and invest the least in male gonad mass. The distribution of teleosts sexual systems on the tree of life does not seem to reflect just adaptive predictions, suggesting that adaptations alone may not fully explain why some sexual forms evolve in some taxa but not others (Williams paradox). We propose that future studies should incorporate mating systems, spawning behaviours, and the diversity of sex determining mechanisms. Some of the latter might constrain the evolution of hermaphroditism, while the non-duality of the embryological origin of teleost gonads might explain why protogyny predominates over protandry in teleosts.",

Different classes of RTs can play different roles, such as template switching and mobility in group II introns, spacer acquisition in CRISPR-Cas systems, mutagenic retrohoming in DGRs, programmed cell suicide in Abi systems, and recently discovered phage defense in retrons. While some classes of RTs have been studied extensively, others remain to be characterized. There is a lack of computational tools for identifying and characterizing various classes of RTs. In this study, we built a tool (called myRT) for identification and classification of prokaryotic RTs. In addition, our tool provides information about the genomic neighborhood of each RT, providing potential functional clues. We applied our tool to predict and classify RTs in all complete and draft bacterial genomes, and created a collection that can be used for exploration of putative RTs. Application of myRT to gut metagenomes showed that gut metagenomes encode proportionally more RTs related to DGRs, outnumbering retron-related RTs, as compared to the collection of reference genomes. MyRT is both available as a standalone software and also through a website.",

    "abstract": "During visually guided behaviors, mere hundreds of milliseconds can elapse between a sensory input and its associated behavioral response. How spikes occurring at different times are integrated to drive perception and action remains poorly understood. We delivered random trains of optogenetic stimulation (white noise) to excite inhibitory interneurons in V1 of mice while they performed a visual detection task. We then performed a reverse correlation analysis on the optogenetic stimuli to generate a neuronal-behavioral kernel: an unbiased, temporally-precise estimate of how suppression of V1 spiking at different moments around the onset of a visual stimulus affects detection of that stimulus. Electrophysiological recordings enabled us to capture the effects of optogenetic stimuli on V1 responsivity and revealed that the earliest stimulus-evoked spikes are preferentially weighted for guiding behavior. These data demonstrate that white noise optogenetic stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding how patterns of spiking in neuronal populations are decoded in generating perception and action.\n\nSignificance StatementHow the brain decodes dynamic neuronal responses to generate perception and behavior remains uncertain. A critical challenge is determining the relative contribution of spikes that occur at different times on the timescale of brain computations (tens of ms). Optogenetic tools permit causal investigations into neuronal-behavioral relationships, but are generally impractical for obtaining millisecond resolution. We circumvented this by delivering random (white noise) patterns of optogenetic inhibition to the primary visual cortex of behaving mice during visual tasks. Aligning optogenetic stimuli to task outcomes (hit, miss) yielded a neuronal-behavioral kernel - a temporal weighting that describes how inhibition at different moments impacts perception of visual stimuli. Thus, this method is a powerful tool for linking neuronal spiking, perception, and behavior.",

Predicting the distribution under current and future climate scenarios is of significance for the sustainable utilization of resources and ecological protection. In this study, we constructed four species distribution models (SDMs) combining species distribution informations, 19 bioclimatic variables, and the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model. The results showed that these 4 plants prefer a cool and humid climate. Under the future climate scenarios, the areas of the highly suitable habitats for Gentiana crasicaulis Duthie ex Burk and Gentiana daurica Fisch were likely to decrease, while Gentiana straminea Maxim was likely to expand, and Gentiana macrophylla Pall was less affected. In addition, the centroids of the highly suitable habitats for the four species shifted north or west. Most notably, most of the highly suitable habitats for the four species remained unchanged, which would be the preferred area for semi-artificial cultivation. The above information in this study would contribute to the development of reasonable strategies to reduce the impact of climate change on the four original plants.",

    "abstract": "Large genomic insertions, deletions, and inversions are a potent source of functional and fitness-altering variation, but are challenging to resolve with short-read DNA sequencing alone. While recent long-read sequencing technologies have greatly expanded the catalog of structural variants (SVs), their costs have so far precluded their application at population scales. Given these limitations, the role of SVs in human adaptation remains poorly characterized. Here, we used a graph-based approach to genotype 107,866 long-read-discovered SVs in short-read sequencing data from diverse human populations. We then applied an admixture-aware method to scan these SVs for patterns of population-specific frequency differentiation--a signature of local adaptation. We identified 220 SVs exhibiting extreme frequency differentiation, including several SVs that were among the lead variants at their corresponding loci. The top two signatures traced to separate insertion and deletion polymorphisms at the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus, together tagging a 325 Kbp haplotype that swept to high frequency and was subsequently fragmented by recombination. Alleles defining this haplotype are nearly fixed (60-95%) in certain Southeast Asian populations, but are rare or absent from other global populations composing the 1000 Genomes Project. Further investigation revealed that the haplotype closely matches with sequences observed in two of three high-coverage Neanderthal genomes, providing strong evidence of a Neanderthal-introgressed origin. This extraordinary episode of positive selection, which we infer to have occurred between 1700 and 8400 years ago, corroborates the role of immune-related genes as prominent targets of adaptive archaic introgression. Our study demonstrates how combining recent advances in genome sequencing, genotyping algorithms, and population genetic methods can reveal signatures of key evolutionary events that remained hidden within poorly resolved regions of the genome.",

This species is characterized by distinct queen-worker dimorphism with strict reproductive division of labor: queens produce both workers and new queens without mating, whereas workers are completely sterile. We collected 333 nests of this species from 14 localities and three laboratory-reared populations in Japan. All wild queens dissected had no sperm in their spermathecae. Laboratory observation confirmed that virgin queens produced workers without mating. Furthermore, microsatellite genotyping showed identical heterozygous genotypes between mothers and their respective daughters, suggesting an extremely low probability of sexual reproduction. Microbial analysis detected no bacterial genera that are known to induce thelytokous parthenogenesis in Hymenoptera. Finally, the lack of variation in partial sequences of mitochondrial DNA among individuals sampled from across Japan suggests recent rapid spread or selective sweep. M. triviale would be a promising model system of superorganism-like adaptation through comparative analysis with well-studied sexual congeners, including the pharaoh ant M. pharaonis.",

    "abstract": "Recent fMRI studies of event segmentation have found that default mode regions represent high-level event structure during movie watching. In these regions, neural patterns are relatively stable during events and shift at event boundaries. Music, like narratives, contains hierarchical event structure (e.g., sections are composed of phrases). Here, we tested the hypothesis that brain activity patterns in default mode regions reflect the high-level event structure of music. We used fMRI to record brain activity from 25 participants (male and female) as they listened to a continuous playlist of 16 musical excerpts, and additionally collected annotations for these excerpts by asking a separate group of participants to mark when meaningful changes occurred in each one. We then identified temporal boundaries between stable patterns of brain activity using a hidden Markov model and compared the location of the model boundaries to the location of the human annotations. We identified multiple brain regions with significant matches to the observer-identified boundaries, including auditory cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and angular gyrus. From these results, we conclude that both higher-order and sensory areas contain information relating to the high-level event structure of music. Moreover, the higher-order areas in this study overlap with areas found in previous studies of event perception in movies and audio narratives, including regions in the default mode network.\n\nSignificance StatementListening to music requires the brain to track dynamics at multiple hierarchical timescales. In our study, we had fMRI participants listen to real-world music (classical and jazz pieces) and then used an unsupervised learning algorithm (a hidden Markov model) to model the high-level event structure of music within participants brain data. This approach revealed that default mode brain regions involved in representing the high-level event structure of narratives are also involved in representing the high-level event structure of music. These findings provide converging support for the hypothesis that these regions play a domain-general role in processing events occurring over long timescales.",

    "abstract": "Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations affecting paternal chromosome 15q11-q13, and characterized by hypotonia, hyperphagia, impaired cognition and behavioural problems. Psychotic illness is a challenging problem for individuals with PWS and has different rates of prevalence in distinct PWS genotypes. Previously, we demonstrated behavioural and cognitive endophenotypes of relevance to psychiatric illness in a mouse model for one of the associated PWS genotypes, namely PWS-IC, in which deletion of the imprinting centre leads to loss of paternal imprinted gene expression and over-expression of Ube3a. Here we examine the broader gene expression changes that are specific to the psychiatric endophenotypes seen in this model. To do this we compared the brain transcriptomic profile of the PWS-IC mouse to the PWS-cr model that carries a deletion of the PWS minimal critical interval spanning the snoRNA Snord116 and Ipw. Firstly, we examined the same behavioural and cognitive endophenotypes of relevance to psychiatric illness in the PWS-cr mice. Unlike the PWS-IC mice, PWS-cr exhibit no differences in locomotor activity, sensory-motor gating, and attention. RNA-seq analysis of neonatal whole brain tissue revealed a greater number of transcriptional changes between PWS-IC and wild-type littermates, than between PWS-cr and wild-type littermates. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes in the PWS-IC brain were enriched for GWAS variants of episodes of psychotic illness but, interestingly, not schizophrenia. These data illustrate the molecular pathways that may underpin psychotic illness in PWS and have implication for potential therapeutic interventions.",

Existing data indicates there is a flexible relationship between somatic activity and dendritic release, but the mechanisms governing this relationship are not completely understood. Here we use a combination of electrical and optical recording techniques to quantify activity-dependent calcium influx in proximal vs. distal dendrites of oxytocinergic magnocellular neurons located in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (OT-MCNs). Results reveal that the dendrites of OT-MCNs are weak conductors of somatic voltage changes, and yet activity-induced dendritic calcium influx can be robustly regulated by a diverse set of stimuli that open or close ionophores located along the dendritic membrane. Overall, this study reveals that dendritic membrane resistance is a dynamic and endogenously regulated feature of OT-MCNs that is likely to have substantial functional impact on central oxytocin release.\n\nIMPACT STATEMENTActivity-induced dendritic calcium influx in oxytocinergic magnocellular neurons can be robustly modulated by a highly diverse set of stimuli acting on distinct types of ionophores expressed along the dendritic membrane.",

    "abstract": "Reconstructing intended speech from neural activity using brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) holds great promises for people with severe speech production deficits. While decoding overt speech has progressed, decoding imagined speech have met limited success, mainly because the associated neural signals are weak and variable hence difficult to decode by learning algorithms. Using three electrocorticography datasets totalizing 1444 electrodes from 13 patients who performed overt and imagined speech production tasks, and based on recent theories of speech neural processing, we extracted consistent and specific neural features usable for future BCIs, and assessed their performance to discriminate speech items in articulatory, phonetic, vocalic, and semantic representation spaces. While high-frequency activity provided the best signal for overt speech, both low- and higher-frequency power and local cross-frequency contributed to successful imagined speech decoding, in particular in phonetic and vocalic, i.e. perceptual, spaces. These findings demonstrate that low-frequency power and cross-frequency dynamics contain key information for imagined speech decoding, and that exploring perceptual spaces offers a promising avenue for future imagined speech BCIs.",

    "abstract": "The default mode network (DMN), the salience network (SN), and the central executive network (CEN) could be considered as the core resting-state brain networks (RSN) due to their involvement in a wide range of cognitive tasks. Despite the large body of knowledge relating to their regional spontaneous activity (RSA) and functional connectivity (FC) of these networks, less is known about the influence of task-associated activity on these parameters and on the interaction between these three networks. We have investigated the effects of the visual-oddball paradigm on three fMRI measures (amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations for RSA, regional homogeneity for local FC, and degree centrality for global FC) in these three core RSN networks. A rest-task-rest paradigm was used and the RSNs were identified using independent component analysis (ICA) on the resting-state data. We found that the task-related brain activity induced different patterns of significant changes within the three RS networks. Most changes were strongly associated with the task performance. Furthermore, the task-activity significantly increased the inter-network correlations between the SN and CEN as well as between the DMN and CEN, but not between the DMN and SN. A significant dynamical change in RSA, alongside local and global FC within the three core resting-state networks following a simple cognitive activity may be an expression of the distinct involvement of these networks in the performance of the task and their various outcomes.",

The mtIF3-small subunit complex then recruits mtIF2, mRNA, and N-formylmethionine-tRNA to initiate mitochondrial translation. Intriguingly, transcripts of the nuclear-encoded mtIF3 gene have been shown present in axonal growth cones; however, the biological function of this compartmentalization remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induces local translation of mtIF3 mRNA in axonal growth cones. Subsequently, mtIF3 protein is translocated into axonal mitochondria and promotes mitochondrial translation as assessed by our newly developed bimolecular fluorescence complementation sensor for the assembly of mitochondrial ribosomes. We further show that BDNF-induced axonal growth requires mtIF3-dependent mitochondrial translation in axons. These findings provide new insight into how neurons adaptively control mitochondrial physiology and axonal development via local mtIF3 translation.",

    "abstract": "Population genetic theory predicts that small effective population sizes (Ne) and restricted gene flow limit the potential for local adaptation. In particular, the probability of evolving similar phenotypes based on shared genetic mechanisms (i.e. parallel evolution), is expected to be reduced. We tested these predictions in a comparative genomic study of two ecologically similar and geographically co-distributed stickleback species (viz. Gasterosteus aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius). We found that P. pungitius harbours less genetic diversity and exhibits higher levels of genetic differentiation and isolation-by-distance than G. aculeatus. Conversely, G. aculeatus exhibits a stronger degree of genetic parallelism across freshwater populations than P. pungitius: 2996 vs. 379 SNPs located within 26 vs nine genomic regions show evidence of selection in multiple freshwater populations of G. aculeatus and P. pungitius, respectively. Most regions involved in parallel evolution in G. aculeatus showed increased levels of divergence, suggestive of selection on ancient haplotypes. In contrast, regions involved in freshwater adaptation in P. pungitius were younger, and often associated with reduced diversity. In accordance with theory, the results suggest that connectivity and genetic drift play crucial roles in determining the levels and geographic distribution of standing genetic variation, providing evidence that population subdivision limits local adaptation and therefore also the likelihood of parallel evolution.",

    "abstract": "Glycogen-specific kinase (GSK3{beta}) is an integral regulator of the Wnt signalling pathway as well as many other diverse signalling pathways and processes. Dys-regulation of GSK3{beta} is implicated in many different pathologies, including neurodegenerative disorders as well as many different tumour types. In the context of tumour development, GSK3{beta} has been shown to play both oncogenic and tumour suppressor roles, depending upon tissue, signalling environment or disease progression. Although multiple substrates of the GSK3{beta} kinase have been identified, the wider protein networks within which GSK3{beta} participates are not well known, and the consequences of these interactions not well understood. In this study, LC-MS/MS expression analysis was performed using knockout GSK3{beta} colorectal cancer cells and isogenic controls in colorectal cancer cell lines carrying dominant stabilizing mutations of {beta}-Catenin. Consistent with the role GSK3{beta}, we found that {beta}-Catenin levels and canonical Wnt activity are unaffected by knockout of GSK3{beta} and therefore use this knockout cell model to identify other processes in which GSK3{beta} is implicated. Quantitative proteomic analysis revealed perturbation of proteins involved in cell-cell adhesion, and we characterize the phenotype and altered proteomic profiles associated with this. We also characterize the perturbation of metabolic pathways resulting from GSK3{beta} knockout and identify defects in glycogen metabolism. In summary, using a precision colorectal cancer cell-line knockout model with constitutively activated {beta}-Catenin we are able to identify several of the diverse pathways and processes associated with GSK3{beta} function.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in HNF1A cause Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young type 3 (MODY3), the most prevalent form of monogenic diabetes. We generated stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine cells from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) with induced hypomorphic mutations in HNF1A. Using these cells, we show that HNF1A orchestrates a transcriptional program required for distinct aspects of {beta}-cell fate and function. During islet cell differentiation, HNF1A deficiency biases islet endocrine cells towards an -cell fate associated with PAX4 down-regulation. HNF1A- deficient {beta}-cells display impaired basal and glucose stimulated-insulin secretion in association with a reduction in CACNA1A and intracellular calcium levels, and impaired insulin granule exocytosis in association with SYT13 down-regulation. Knockout of PAX4, CACNA1A and SYT13 reproduce the relevant phenotypes. Reduction of insulin secretion is associated with accumulation of enlarged secretory granules, and altered stoichiometry of secreted insulin to C-peptide. In HNF1A deficient {beta}-cells, glibenclamide, a sulfonylurea drug used in the treatment of MODY3 patients, increases intracellular calcium to levels beyond those achieved by glucose, and restores C-peptide and insulin secretion to a normal stoichiometric ratio. To study HNF1A deficiency in the context of a human disease model, we also generated stem cell-derived pancreatic endocrine cells from two MODY3 patients induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). While insulin secretion defects are constitutive in cells with complete HNF1A loss of function, {beta}-cells heterozygous for hypomorphic HNF1A mutations are initially normal, but lose the ability to secrete insulin and acquire abnormal stoichiometric secretion ratios. Importantly, the defects observed in these stem cell models are also seen in circulating proportions of insulin:C-peptide in nine MODY3 patients.\n\nOne sentence of summaryDeficiency of the transcription factor HNF1A biases islet endocrine cell fate towards -cells, impairs intracellular calcium homeostasis and insulin exocytosis, alters the stoichiometry of insulin to C-peptide release, and leads to an accumulation of abnormal insulin secretory granules in {beta}-cells.",

Transcriptome maturation by the RNA binding protein Muscleblind Like 1 (MBNL1) has emerged as a potential driver of differentiated cell states. Here genetic lineage tracing of myofibroblasts in the injured heart demonstrated that gains in MBNL1 function corresponded to profibrotic fibroblast states. Similarly, in mice cardiac fibroblast specific MBNL1 overexpression induced a transcriptional myofibroblast profile in healthy cardiac fibroblasts that prevented the fibroproliferative phase of cardiac wound healing. By contrast loss of MBNL1 reverted cardiac fibroblasts to a pro-proliferative epicardial progenitor state that limited cardiac fibrosis following myocardial infarction. This progenitor state transition was associated with an MBNL1-dependent destabilization of the mesenchymal transition gene, Sox9. These findings suggest that MBNL1 regulation of the fibroblast transcriptome drives state transitions underlying cardiac fibrosis and repair.",

This is evident in diseases that progress through a common set of intermediate patho-endophenotypes. Precision medicine aims to delineate the molecular players for individualized and early interventions. Functional studies in Lymphoblastoid Cell Line (LCL) model of phenotypically well characterized healthy individuals can help deconvolute and validate these molecular mechanisms. We developed LCLs from eight healthy individuals belonging to three extreme constitution types, deep phenotyped on the basis of Ayurveda. LCLs were characterized by karyotyping and immunophenotyping. Growth characteristics and response to UV was studied in these LCLs. We observed significant differences in cell proliferation rates between the contrasting groups such that one type (Kapha) proliferates significantly slower than the other two (Vata, Pitta). In response to UV, one fast growing group (Vata) shows higher cell death but recovers its numbers due to inherent higher rates of proliferation. The baseline differences in cell proliferation are key to understanding the survival of cells in UV stress. Variability in baseline cellular phenotypes not only explains the cellular basis of different constitutions types but can also help set priors during designing an individualized therapy with DNA damaging agents. This is the first study of its kind that shows variability of intermediate patho-phenotypes amongst healthy individuals that have implications in precision medicine.",

Connexins, and the gap junctions they form, have been implicated in cancer progression, and may be associated endometriosis pathophysiology. Single cell transcriptomic profiling of endometrial epithelial and stromal cells from women with endometriosis reveals a striking and progressive shift in expression of connexins and related regulatory and junctional genes.

We demonstrate that IL-23R is required for Th1 cells to acquire a highly colitogenic phenotype. scRNAseq analysis of intestinal T cells enabled us to identify novel regulators induced by IL-23R-signaling in Th1 cells which differed from those expressed in Th17 cells. The perturbation of one of these regulators (CD160) in Th1 cells inhibited induction of colitis. In this process, we were able to uncouple IL-23R as a purely Th17 cell-specific factor and implicate IL-23R signaling as a pathogenic driver of Th1 cell-mediated tissue inflammation and disease.",

    "abstract": "The cytoskeleton is a supramolecular structure consisting of interacting protein networks that support cell dynamics in essential processes such as migration and division, as well as in responses to stress. Fast cytoskeletal remodeling is achieved with the participation of regulatory proteins and posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Redox-related PTMs are emerging as critical players in cytoskeletal regulation. Here we used a cellular model of mild nitroxidative stress in which a peroxynitrite donor induced transient changes in the organization of three key cytoskeletal proteins, i.e., vimentin, actin and tubulin. Nitroxidative stress-induced reconfiguration of intermediate filaments, microtubules and actin structures were further correlated with their PTM profiles and dynamics of the PTM landscape. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, 62 different PTMs were identified and relatively quantified in vimentin, actin and tubulin proteins, including 12 enzymatic, 13 oxidative and 2 nitric oxide-derived modifications as well as 35 modifications by carbonylated lipid peroxidation products, thus evidencing the occurrence of a chain reaction with formation of reactive species and the activation of multiple signaling pathways. Our results unveil the presence of certain modifications under basal conditions and their modulation in response to stress in a target-, residue- and reactive species-dependent manner. Moreover, we identified protein PTM \"hot spots\", such as the single cysteine residue of vimentin, supporting its role in PTM cross-talk and redox sensing. Finally, identification of novel PTMs in these proteins may pave the way for unveiling novel cytoskeleton regulatory mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "Odums perturbation theory hypothesizes that toxic pollutants cause damage to ecosystems early in the course of contamination. In contrast, organic pollutants enrich the ecosystem until it exceeds their carrying capacity, an effect known as the subsidy-stress gradient. Understanding this dynamic can improve the efficiency of river restoration programs and bring significant benefits to society by providing ecosystem services that were lost. However, the initial effects of the most common human-induced disturbances in Atlantic Forest streams are not well known, indicating the necessity to evaluate the subsidy-stress gradient in these vulnerable and diverse ecosystems.\n\nAimWe evaluated the composition and abundance of the community of aquatic insects from leaf litter of headwater streams in three conditions: a fully forested area (reference stream), a low-intensity urban settlement (urban stream), and a region with small farms dedicated to the cultivation of fruits and vegetables (agricultural stream).\n\nMethodsWe used alpha and beta diversity metrics and a specific biotic index to test the subsidy-stress gradient prediction.\n\nResultsThe agricultural stream showed the most degraded ecological condition. The urban stream and the reference stream showed similarity in alpha diversity metrics. According to the biotic index, the streams showed a gradient of environmental quality, with the reference stream showing the best quality and the agricultural stream the worst quality.\n\nConclusionsThe agricultural stream showed a decrease in the environmental quality consistent with the effect predicted by the subsidy-stress gradient due to toxic pollutants contribution. However, the low-intensity enrichment of organic matter from the urban settlement causes a disorder in the ecosystem that reduces its environmental quality, contrary to the predicted by the subsidy-stress gradient.",

    "abstract": "The regulation and coordination of cell growth and division is a long-standing problem in cell physiology. Recent single-cell measurements using microfluidic devices provide quantitative time-series data of various physiological parameters of cells. To clarify the regulatory laws and associated relevant parameters such as cell size, mathematical models have been constructed based on physical insights over the phenomena and tested by their capabilities to reproduce the measured data. However, such a conventional model construction by abduction faces a constant risk that we may overlook important parameters and factors especially when complicated time series data is concerned. In addition, comparing a model and data for validation is not trivial when we work on noisy multi-dimensional data. Using cell size control as an example, we demonstrate that this problem can be addressed by employing a neural network (NN) method, originally developed for history-dependent temporal point processes. The NN can effectively segregate history-dependent deterministic factors and unexplainable noise from a given data by flexibly representing functional forms of the deterministic relation and noise distribution. With this method, we represent and infer birth and division cell size distributions of bacteria and fission yeast. The known size control mechanisms such as adder model are revealed as the conditional dependence of the size distributions on history and their Markovian properties are shown sufficient. In addition, the inferred NN model provides a better data representation for the abductive model searching than descriptive statistics. Thus, the NN method can work as a powerful tool to process the noisy data for uncovering hidden dynamic laws.",

    "abstract": "Understanding state transition caused by several intrinsic and extrinsic factors such as environmental change and increased stress of human activities has been a significant focus in ecological studies. Analysis of time-series data is indispensable to identify a causal relationship between the possible factors and community change. Among several time-series analysis, a nonlinear time series analysis method called empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) has been recently applied to infer causality of community change that arose from intraspecies interactions. EDM allows model-free analysis to estimate the degree of action strength of intraspecific and interspecific interactions at the population level. Convergent cross-mapping (CCM) is an empirical dynamic analysis method used to suggest the existence of causality by reconstructing the state space of a dynamical system from a time series of observations without assuming any explicit mathematical equations. Although CCM allows for inferring directional interpretation of causal relationships from multivariate time series data, one of the major challenges is its non-applicability to compositional data, a common representation of next generation sequencing data such as microbiome. This study aimed to explore a practical approach applied explicitly to compositional data analysis. More specifically, we propose a heuristic but useful transformation that enables CCM to be applied to compositional data. The proposed transformation has demonstrated its applicability to compositional data equivalent to the conventional CCM to untransformed data. Application of the proposed transformation to sequence-based microbial community profiling data provides reasonable implication to the possible causal relationship during state transition.\n\nAuthor summarySeveral types of ecological studies such as trophic changes in lakes, marine plankton communities, forest ecosystems, terrestrial ecosystems, and interactions between plants and soils have employed time-series analyses for identifying the factors that might cause state changes. With the rise of next-generation sequencing, our understanding of these ecosystems is expanding to analyze sequence data. A nonlinear time series analysis method, termed empirical dynamic modeling, has been recently applied for analyzing time-series data. Among different empirical dynamic modeling methods, convergent cross-mapping (CCM) is frequently used to infer a causal relationship. Although CCM enables the directional interpretation of causal relationships, it cannot be applied to compositional data analysis. This study proposes a novel type of transformation, Reciprocal Logarithmic Ratio (RLR) transformation, that enables CCM to be applied to compositional data. With RLR-transformation, CCM results for compositional data are comparable to those for absolute data, and it is confirmed that the transformation is applicable to sequence data as well. The RLR-transformation is expected to provide a better understanding of ecological interactions by estimating causal relationships in compositional data.",

    "abstract": "Numerous micro(mi)RNAs (short noncoding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression) have been linked to platinum (Pt) sensitivity and resistance in ovarian cancer (OC). miRNA activity occurs when the guide strand of the miRNA, with its seed sequence (pos. 2-7/8), is loaded into the RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) and targets complementary short seed matches in the 3 untranslated region of mRNAs. Toxic seeds, targeting genes critical for cancer cell survival, have been found in tumor suppressive miRNAs. Many si- and shRNAs can also kill cancer cells via toxic seeds, the most toxic carrying G-rich 6mer seed sequences. We now show that treatment of OC cells with Pt leads to an increase in RISC-bound miRNAs carrying toxic 6mer seeds and a decrease in miRNAs with nontoxic seeds. Pt-resistant cells did not exhibit this toxicity shift but retained sensitivity to cell death mediated by siRNAs carrying toxic 6mer seeds. Analysis of RISC-bound miRNAs in OC patients revealed that the ratio between miRNAs with toxic versus miRNAs with nontoxic seeds was predictive of treatment outcome. Application of the 6mer seed toxicity concept to cancer relevant miRNAs provides a new framework for understanding and predicting cancer therapy responses.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen isotope analyses of amino-acids ({delta}15N-AA) are increasingly used to decipher food webs. Interpretation of {delta}15N-AA in consumers relies on the assumption that physiological status has a negligible influence on the trophic enrichment factor (TEF). Recent experiments have shown that this is not always the case and there is a need to validate derived trophic position (TP) estimates using ecological data. We analyzed {delta}15N-AA in cod and herring (1980-2019) from the Baltic Sea, a species-poor system where dramatic reduction in condition status of cod has occurred. We expected that TEFcod-herring in trophic AAs would increase during periods of poor cod growth, resulting in inflated TP estimates. We found that TEF and TP estimates were negatively linked to individual condition status, prey fat content and the hypoxic state of the ecosystem. Statistically adjusting for these variables resulted in lower cod TP, highlighting the importance of including ecological knowledge when interpreting TP.\n\nScientific Significance StatementNitrogen stable isotope analyses in amino acids are increasingly used in ecology to understand how environmental change impacts food-webs. Specifically, it is used to more accurately calculate trophic position (TP) of consumers. Controlled experiments have shown that physiological status can alter amino acid isotope composition and TP interpretation, but field studies are lacking. We use 40 years of archived material to demonstrate that TP estimates in Baltic Sea cod and its prey herring are directly related to physiological status. This has important implications for interpreting the real trophic ecology of consumers under environmental stress. By simultaneously measuring condition status in both predator and prey it is possible to adjust for them as confounding variables and decipher actual consumer TP.",

    "abstract": "Changes in a few key transcriptional regulators can lead to different biological states, including cell activation and differentiation, and diseases. Extracting the key gene regulators governing a biological state allows us to gain mechanistic insights and can further help in translational research. Most current tools perform pathway/GO enrichment analysis to identify key genes and regulators but tend to overlook the regulatory interactions between genes and proteins. Here we present RegEnrich, an open-source Bioconductor R package, which combines differential expression analysis, data-driven gene regulatory network inference, enrichment analysis, and gene regulator ranking to identify key regulators using gene/protein expression profiling data. By benchmarking using multiple gene expression datasets of gene silencing studies, we found that RegEnrich using the GSEA method to rank the regulators performed the best to retrieve the key regulators. Further, RegEnrich was applied to 21 publicly available datasets on in vitro interferon-stimulation of different cell types. We found that not only IRF and STAT transcription factor families played an important role in cells responding to IFN, but also several ETS transcription factor family members, such as ELF1 and ETV7, are highly associated with IFN stimulations. Collectively, RegEnrich can accurately identify key gene regulators from the cells under different biological states in a data-driven manner, which can be valuable in mechanistically studying cell differentiation, cell response to drug stimulation, disease development, and ultimately drug development.",

The transcriptomics and proteomics of this process are intensively studied, while information about how the cell responds structurally to heat stress is mostly lacking. Here, Saccharomyces cerevisiae were subjected to a mild continuous heat shock and intermittently cryo-immobilized for electron microscopy. Through measuring changes in all distinguishable organelle numbers, sizes, and morphologies in over 2400 electron micrographs a major restructuring of the cells internal architecture during the progressive heat shock was revealed. The cell grew larger but most organelles within it expanded even more. Organelles responded to heat shock at different times, both in terms of size and number, and adaptations of certain organelles morphology were observed. Multivesicular bodies grew to almost 170% in size, indicating a previously unknown involvement in the heat shock response. A previously undescribed electron translucent structure accumulated close to the plasma membrane during the entire time course. This all-encompassing approach provides a detailed chronological progression of organelle adaptation throughout the cellular stress response.\n\nSummary statementExposure to mild heat shock leads to large quantifiable changes in the cellular ultrastructure of yeast, shows involvement of MVBs in the heat shock response and the apparition of novel structures.",

    "abstract": "Understanding how extrinsic factors modulate genetically encoded information to produce a specific phenotype is of prime scientific interest. In particular, the feedback mechanism between abiotic forces and locomotory organs during morphogenesis to achieve efficient movement is a highly relevant example of such modulation. The study of this developmental process can provide unique insights on the transduction of cues at the interface between physics and biology. Here, we take advantage of the natural ability of adult zebrafish to regenerate their amputated fins to assess its morphogenic plasticity upon external modulations. Using a variety of surgical and chemical treatments, we are able to induce phenotypic responses to the structure of the fin. In particular, fin cleft depth and the bifurcation of the bony rays are modulated by the surface area of the stump. To dissect the role of mechanotransduction in this process, we investigate the patterns of hydrodynamic forces acting on the surface of a zebrafish fin during regeneration by using particle tracking velocimetry on a range of biomimetic hydrofoils. This experimental approach enables us to quantitatively compare hydrodynamic stress distributions over flapping fins of varying sizes and shapes. As a result, viscous shear stress acting on the tip of the fin and the resulting internal tension are proposed as suitable signals for guiding the regulation of ray growth dynamics and branching pattern. Our findings suggest that mechanical forces are involved in the fine-tuning of the locomotory organ during fin morphogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Addictive drugs increase dopamine in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), where it persistently shapes excitatory glutamate transmission and hijacks natural reward processing. Herein, we provide evidence, from mice to human, that an underlying mechanism relies on drug-evoked heteromerization of glutamate NMDA receptors (NMDAR) with dopamine receptor 1 (D1R) or 2 (D2R). Using temporally-controlled inhibition of D1R-NMDAR heteromerization, we unraveled their selective implication in early developmental phases of cocaine-mediated synaptic, morphological and behavioral responses. In contrast, preventing D2R-NMDAR heteromerization blocked the persistence of these adaptations. Importantly, interfering with these heteromers spared natural reward processing. Strikingly, we established that D2R-NMDAR complexes exist in human samples and showed that, despite a decreased D2R protein expression in the NAc, psychostimulant-addicts display a higher proportion of D2R forming heteromers with NMDAR. These findings contribute to a better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying addiction and uncover D2R-NMDAR heteromers as targets with potential therapeutic value.",

    "abstract": "The small GTPase Rab11 plays pivotal roles in diverse physiological phenomena, including the recycling of membrane proteins, cytokinesis, neurite outgrowth, and epithelial morphogenesis. One effective method of analyzing the function of endogenous Rab11 is to overexpress a Rab11-binding domain of one of its effectors, e.g., the C-terminal domain of Rab11-FIP2 (Rab11-FIP2-C), as a dominant-negative construct. However, the drawback of this method is the broader Rab binding specificity of the effector domain, because Rab11-FIP2-C binds to Rabs other than Rab11, e.g., to Rab14 and Rab25. In this study, we bioengineered an artificial Rab11-specific binding domain, named RBD11. Expression of RBD11 visualized endogenous Rab11 without affecting its localization or function, whereas expression of a tandem RBD11, named 2xRBD11, inhibited epithelial morphogenesis and induced a multi-lumen phenotype characteristic of Rab11-deficient cysts. We also developed two tools for temporally and reversibly analyzing Rab11-dependent membrane trafficking: tetracycline-inducible 2xRBD11 and an artificially oligomerized domain (FM)-tagged RBD11.",

    "abstract": "The flagellar pocket (FP) is the only endo- and exocytic organelle in most trypanosomes and, as such, is essential throughout the life cycle of the parasite. The neck of the FP is maintained enclosed around the flagellum via the flagellar pocket collar (FPC). The FPC is a macromolecular cytoskeletal structure and is essential for the formation of the FP and cytokinesis. FPC biogenesis and structure are poorly understood, mainly due to the lack of information on FPC composition. To date, only two FPC proteins, BILBO1 and FPC4, have been characterized. BILBO1 forms a molecular skeleton upon which other FPC proteins can, theoretically, dock onto. We previously identified FPC4 as the first BILBO1 interacting partner and demonstrated that its C-terminal domain interacts with the BILBO1 N-terminal domain (NTD). Here, we report the characterization of a new FPC component and BILBO1 partner protein, BILBO2 (Tb927.6.3240) by yeast two-hybrid screen, bioinformatics, functional and structural studies. We show that BILBO2 colocalizes with BILBO1 and can modulate the shape of the BILBO1 filament by interacting with the BILBO1 EF-hand domains. Further, we demonstrate that BILBO1 and BILBO2 share a homologous NTD domain and that both domains interact with FPC4. We have determined a 1.9 [A] resolution crystal structure of the BILBO2 NTD in complex with the FPC4 BILBO1-binding domain. Together with mutational analyses, our studies reveal key residues for the function of the BILBO2 NTD and its interaction with FPC4 and evidenced a tripartite interaction between BILBO1, BILBO2, and FPC4. Our work sheds light on the first atomic structure of an FPC protein complex and represents a significant step in deciphering the FPC function in Trypanosoma brucei and other pathogenic kinetoplastids.\n\nAuthor summaryTrypanosomes belong to a group of zoonotic, protist, parasites that are found in Africa, Asia, South America, and Europe and are responsible for severe human and animal diseases. They all have a common structure called the flagellar pocket (FP). In most trypanosomes, all macromolecular exchanges between the trypanosome and the environment occur via the FP. The FP is thus essential for cell viability and evading the host immune response. We have been studying the flagellar pocket collar (FPC), an enigmatic macromolecular structure at the neck of the FP, and demonstrated its essentiality for the biogenesis of the FP. We demonstrated that BILBO1 is an essential protein of the FPC that interacts with other proteins including a microtubule-binding protein FPC4.\n\nHere we identify another bona fide FPC protein, BILBO2, so named because of close similarity with BILBO1 in protein organization and functional domains. We demonstrate that BILBO1 and BILBO2 share a common N-terminal domain involved in the interaction with FPC4, and illustrate a tripartite interaction between BILBO1, BILBO2, and FPC4. Our study also provides the first atomic view of two FPC components. These data represent an additional step in deciphering the FPC structure and function in T. brucei.",
