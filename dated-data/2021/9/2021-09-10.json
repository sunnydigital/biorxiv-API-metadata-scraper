    "abstract": "Perceptual decisions depend both on the features of the incoming stimulus and on the ongoing brain activity at the moment the stimulus is received. Specifically, trial-to-trial fluctuations in cortical excitability have been linked to fluctuations in the amplitude of pre-stimulus alpha oscillations ({approx}8-13 Hz), which are in turn are associated with fluctuations in subjects tendency to report the detection of a stimulus. It is currently unknown whether alpha oscillations bias post-perceptual decision making, or even bias subjective perception itself. To answer this question, we used a contrast discrimination task in which subjects reported which of two gratings - one in each hemifield - was perceived as having a stronger contrast. Our EEG analysis showed that subjective contrast was reduced for the stimulus in the hemifield represented in the hemisphere with relatively stronger pre-stimulus alpha amplitude, reflecting reduced cortical excitability. Furthermore, the strength of this spontaneous hemispheric lateralization was strongly correlated with the magnitude of individual subjects biases, suggesting that the spontaneous patterns of alpha lateralization play a role in explaining the intersubject variability in contrast perception. These results indicate that spontaneous fluctuations in cortical excitability, indicted by patterns of pre-stimulus alpha amplitude, affect perceptual decisions by altering the phenomenological perception of the visual world.\n\nSignificance StatementOur moment to moment perception of the world is shaped by the features of the environment surrounding us, as much as by the constantly evolving states that characterize our brain activity. Previous research showed how the ongoing electrical activity of the brain can influence whether a stimulus has accessed conscious perception. However, evidence is currently missing on whether these electrical brain states can be associated to the subjective experience of a sensory input. Here we show that local changes in patterns of electrical brain activity preceding visual stimulation can bias our phenomenological perception. Importantly, we show that the strength of these variations can help explaining the great inter-individual variability in how we perceive the visual environment surrounding us.",

    "abstract": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) is a positively-stranded RNA arbovirus of the genus Alphavirus that causes encephalitis in humans. Cynomolgus macaques are a relevant model of the human disease caused by VEEV and are useful in exploring pathogenic mechanisms and the host response to VEEV infection. Macaques were exposed to small-particle aerosols containing virus derived from an infectious clone of VEEV strain INH-9813, a subtype IC strain isolated from a human infection. VEEV-exposed macaques developed a biphasic fever after infection similar to that seen in humans. Maximum temperature deviation correlated with the inhaled dose, but fever duration did not. Neurological signs, suggestive of virus penetration into the CNS, were predominantly seen in the second febrile period. Electroencephalography data indicated a statistically significant decrease in all power bands and circadian index during the second febrile period that returned to normal after fever resolved. Intracranial pressure increased late in the second febrile period. On day 6 post-infection macaques had high levels of MCP-1 and IP-10 chemokines in the CNS, as well as a marked increase of T lymphocytes and activated microglia. More than four weeks after infection, viral genomic RNA was found in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid and cervical lymph nodes. Pro-inflammatory cytokines & chemokines, infiltrating leukocytes and pathological changes were seen in the CNS tissues of macaques euthanized at these times. These data are consistent with persistence of virus replication and/or genomic RNA and potentially, inflammatory sequelae in the central nervous system after resolution of acute VEEV disease.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli were previously considered asaccharolytic, but are now known to possess specific saccharides metabolization pathways, including L-fucose. To investigate the influence of the L-fucose utilization cluster on Campylobacter growth, survival and metabolism, we performed comparative genotyping and phenotyping of the C. jejuni reference isolate NCTC11168 (human isolate), C. jejuni Ca1352 (chicken meat isolate), C. jejuni Ca2426 (sheep isolate), and C. coli Ca0121 (pig manure isolate), that all possess the L-fucose utilization cluster.\n\nAll isolates showed enhanced survival and prolonged spiral cell morphology in aging cultures up to day seven in L-fucose-enriched MEM medium (MEMF) compared to MEM. HPLC analysis indicated L-fucose utilization linked to acetate, lactate, pyruvate and succinate production, confirming the activation of the L-fucose pathway in these isolates. Highest consumption of L-fucose by C. coli Ca0121, is conceivably linked to its enhanced growth performance up to day 7, reaching 9.3 log CFU/ml compared to approximately 8.3 log CFU/ml for the C. jejuni isolates. Genetic analysis of their respective L-fucose clusters revealed several differences, including a 1 bp deletion in the Cj0489 gene of C. jejuni NCTC11168, causing a frameshift in this isolate resulting in two separate genes, Cj0489 and Cj0490, while no apparent phenotype could be linked to the presumed frameshift in the NCTC11168 isolate. Additionally, we found that the L-fucose cluster of C. coli Ca0121 was most distant from C. jejuni NCTC11168, but confirmation of links to L-fucose metabolism associated phenotypic traits in C. coli versus C. jejuni isolates requires further studies.\n\nImportanceCampylobacter is the leading cause of gastroenteritis in humans worldwide, with increasing incidence and prevalence in recent years. The most prevalent species are Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli with 83% and 10% of all Campylobacter cases, respectively. Previously it was found that the majority of Campylobacter isolates are able to metabolize L-fucose (fuc+ isolates), a sugar that is widely present in the human gut. Putative roles for L-fucose in fuc+ C. jejuni isolates were found in growth, biofilm formation and virulence. Despite this, relatively little is known about L-fucose metabolism and the impact on growth and survival in fuc+ Campylobacter isolates. The results from our comparative genotyping and phenotyping study demonstrate that L-fucose, in both C. jejuni and C. coli fuc+ isolates, is involved in enhanced survival, prolonged spiral cell morphology and changes in the general metabolism. Possible links between phenotypes and differences in respective L-fucose gene clusters are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The Golgi apparatus plays a central role as a processing and sorting station along the secretory pathway. In multicellular organisms, this organelle displays two structural organizations, whereby its functional subunits, the mini-stacks, are either dispersed throughout the cell or linked into a centralized structure, called Golgi \"ribbon\". The Golgi ribbon is considered to be a feature typical of vertebrate cells. Here we report that this is not the case. We show that sea urchin embryonic cells assemble Golgi ribbons during early development. Sea urchins are deuterostomes, the bilaterian animal clade to which chordates, and thus vertebrates, also belong.\n\nFar from being a structural innovation of vertebrates, the Golgi ribbon therefore appears to be an ancient cellular feature evolved before the split between echinoderms and chordates. Evolutionary conservation of the ribbon architecture surmises that it must play fundamental roles in the biology of deuterostomes.",

Here we define the evolutionarily conserved mitochondrial enzyme ALH-6/ALDH4A1 as a biomarker for age-related changes in muscle health by combining C. elegans genetics and a gene-wide association study (GeneWAS) from aged human participants of the US Health and Retirement Study (HRS)1-4. In a screen for mutations that activate SKN-1-dependent oxidative stress responses in the muscle of C. elegans5-7, we identified 96 independent genetic mutants harboring loss-of-function alleles of alh-6, exclusively. These genetic mutations map across the ALH-6 polypeptide, which lead to age-dependent loss of muscle health. Intriguingly, genetic variants in ALDH4A1 differentially impact age-related muscle function in humans. Taken together, our work uncovers mitochondrial alh-6/ALDH4A1 as a critical component of normal muscle aging across species and a predictive biomarker for muscle health over the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "We present a fast particle fusion method for particles imaged with single-molecule localization microscopy. The state-of-the-art approach based on all-to-all registration has proven to work well but its computational cost scales unfavourably with the number of particles N, namely as N2. Our method overcomes this problem and achieves a linear scaling of computational cost with N by making use of the Joint Registration of Multiple Point Clouds (JRMPC) method. Straightforward application of JRMPC fails as mostly locally optimal solutions are found. These usually contain several overlapping clusters, that each consist of well-aligned particles, but that have different poses. We solve this issue by repeated runs of JRMPC for different initial conditions, followed by a classification step to identify the clusters, and a connection step to link the different clusters obtained for different initializations. In this way a single well-aligned structure is obtained containing the majority of the particles.\n\nWe achieve reconstructions of experimental DNA-origami datasets consisting of close to 400 particles within only 10 min on a CPU, with an image resolution of 3.2 nm. In addition, we show artifact-free reconstructions of symmetric structures without making any use of the symmetry. We also demonstrate that the method works well for poor data with a low density of labelling and for 3D data.",

Using a ternary mean field \"stickers-and-spacers\" model, we demonstrate that if sticker association is of the order of a few times the thermal energy, a delicate balance between specific binding and non-specific polymer-solvent interactions gives rise to a particularly rich ternary phase behavior under physiological circumstances. For a generic system represented by a solution comprising multi-associative scaffold and client polymers, the difference in solvent compatibility between the polymers modulates the nature of isothermal liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) between associative and segregative. The calculations reveal regimes of dualistic phase behavior, where both types of LLPS occur within the same phase diagram, either associated with the presence of multiple miscibility gaps, or a flip in the slope of the tie-lines belonging to a single coexistence region.",

    "abstract": "With the advent of high-throughput assays, a large number of biological experiments can be carried out. Image-based assays are among the most accessible and inexpensive technologies for this purpose. Indeed, these assays have proved to be effective in characterizing unknown functions of genes and small molecules. Image analysis pipelines have a pivotal role in translating raw images that are captured in such assays into useful and compact representation, also known as measurements. CellProfiler is a popular and commonly used tool for this purpose through providing readily available modules for the cell/nuclei segmentation, and making various measurements, or features, for each cell/nuclei. Single cell features are then aggregated for each treatment replica to form treatment \"profiles.\" However, there may be several sources of error in the CellProfiler quantification pipeline that affects the downstream analysis that is performed on the profiles. In this work, we examined various preprocessing approaches to improve the profiles. We consider identification of drug mechanisms of action as the downstream task to evaluate such preprocessing approaches. Our enhancement steps mainly consist of data cleaning, cell level outlier detection, toxic drug detection, and regressing out the cell area from all other features, as many of them are widely affected by the cell area. We also examined unsupervised and weakly-supervised deep learning based methods to reduce the feature dimensionality, and finally suggest possible avenues for future research.",

Remarkably, the 4 helix shows gradual dislocation from the core 2-3 structure as pH increases from 6.5 to 7.5.

In this study, genomic analysis was performed on 98 HIV-1 genomes to determine the most coherent target that could be utilized to restrict and cease the viral replication, the reverse transcriptase enzyme. Following the identification of the target protein, the RNase H activity of the reverse transcriptase was nominated as the potent target given the limited research associated with it. A library of 94 thousand small molecule inhibitors was generated and virtual screening was performed to identify hits, based on the reproducibility of the screening results, 4 compounds with the best scores were considered and their interaction within the active site was analyzed. Subsequently, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and MM-PBSA was performed to validate the stability and binding free energy of the hits within the RNase H active. In silico ADMET assays were performed on the hit compounds to analyze their drug-likeness, physicochemical and pharmacological properties. Phomoarcherin B, a pentacyclic aromatic sesquiterpene naturally found in the endophytic fungus Phomopsis archeri, known for its anticancer properties scored the best in all the experiments and was nominated as a potential inhibitor of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase RNase H activity.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) has remained a global public health issue for the past 4 decades with millions of patients around the globe affected. Long years of research in the field of anti-viral therapies had introduced several drugs to combat the viral infection, however, most of these drugs come with their shortcomings. In this study, computational drug discovery approaches were utilized to research novel drugs that could be used as anti-viral agents against the former virus, the results had revealed Phomoarcherin B, a natural compound from an endophytic fungus to hold promising therapeutic potentials.",

However, the mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of particular cancer cells to CDK7 inhibition remain largely unknown.\n\nTo improve the outcome of individual patients and increase the chances of successful CDK7i approval, we assessed which fundamental cellular processes determine sensitivity to CDK7 inhibition, using the highly specific CDK7 inhibitor ICEC0942. Our data shows that selective CDK7 inhibition acutely arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, which over time leads to senescence. Through a genome-wide CRISPR knock-out chemogenetic screen we identified active mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling, as an important determinant of ICEC0942-induced senescence and show that a cancer-associated mutation that promotes cell growth can increase sensitivity to ICEC0942.

    "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the most lethal and treatment-resistant breast cancer subtype with limited treatment options. We previously identified a protein complex unique to TNBC cancer stem cells composed of the gap junction protein connexin 26 (Cx26), the pluripotency transcription factor NANOG, and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). We sought to determine whether a peptide mimetic of Cx26 designed to target the complex attenuated tumor growth in pre-clinical models. Histological assessment was employed to verify expression of complex members. We designed peptides based on Cx26 juxtamembrane domains and performed binding experiments with NANOG and FAK using surface plasmon resonance. Peptides with high affinity were engineered with a cell-penetrating sequence and assessed in functional assays including cell proliferation, self-renewal, and in vivo tumor growth, and downstream signaling changes were measured. Binding studies revealed that the Cx26 C-terminal tail and intracellular loop bound to NANOG and FAK with submicromolar-to-micromolar affinity and that a 5-amino acid sequence in the C-terminal tail of Cx26 (RYCSG) was sufficient for binding. The Cx26 C-terminal tail was tagged with an antennapedia cell-penetrating peptide sequence and intracellular localization was confirmed. The cell-penetrating Cx26 peptide (aCx26-pep) disrupted self-renewal as assessed by tumorsphere formation assay while reducing nuclear FAK and NANOG and inhibiting NANOG target gene expression in TNBC cells but not luminal mammary epithelial cells. In vivo, aCx26-pep reduced tumor growth and proliferation and induced cell death. We provide proof-of-concept that a Cx26 peptide-based strategy inhibits growth and alters NANOG activity in TNBC.",

    "abstract": "Comparing SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced gene expression signatures to drug treatment-induced gene expression signatures is a promising bioinformatic tool to repurpose existing drugs against SARS-CoV-2. The general hypothesis of signature based drug repurposing is that drugs with inverse similarity to a disease signature can reverse disease phenotype and thus be effective against it. However, in the case of viral infection diseases, like SARS-CoV-2, infected cells also activate adaptive, antiviral pathways, so that the relationship between effective drug and disease signature can be more ambiguous.\n\nTo address this question, we analysed gene expression data from in vitro SARS-CoV-2 infected cell lines, and gene expression signatures of drugs showing anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Our extensive functional genomic analysis showed that both infection and treatment with in vitro effective drugs leads to activation of antiviral pathways like NFkB and JAK-STAT. Based on the similarity - and not inverse similarity - between drug and infection-induced gene expression signatures, we were able to predict the in vitro antiviral activity of drugs. We also identified SREBF1/2, key regulators of lipid metabolising enzymes, as the most activated transcription factors by several in vitro effective antiviral drugs. Using a fluorescently labeled cholesterol sensor, we showed that these drugs decrease the cholesterol levels of plasma-membrane. Supplementing drug-treated cells with cholesterol reversed the in vitro antiviral effect, suggesting the depleting plasma-membrane cholesterol plays a key role in virus inhibitory mechanism.\n\nOur results can help to more effectively repurpose approved drugs against SARS-CoV-2, and also highlights key mechanisms behind their antiviral effect.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=171 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459786v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (37K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@7cd823org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@51f699org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@114c555org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a774ee_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Optimal immune responses furnish long-lasting (durable) antibodies protective across dynamically mutating viral variants (broad). To assess robustness of mRNA vaccine-induced immunity, we compared antibody durability and breadth after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. While vaccination delivered robust initial virus-specific antibodies with some cross-variant coverage, pre-variant SARS-CoV-2 infection-induced antibodies, while modest in magnitude, showed highly stable long-term antibody dynamics. Vaccination after infection induced maximal antibody magnitudes with enhanced longitudinal stability while infection-naive vaccinee antibodies fell with time to post-infection-alone levels. The composition of antibody neutralizing activity to variant relative to original virus also differed between groups, with infection-induced antibodies demonstrating greater relative breadth. Differential antibody durability trajectories favored COVID-19-recovered subjects with dual memory B cell features of greater early antibody somatic mutation and cross-coronavirus reactivity. By illuminating an infection-mediated antibody breadth advantage and an anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody durability-enhancing function conferred by recalled immunity, these findings may serve as guides for ongoing vaccine strategy improvement.",

    "abstract": "Dendritic cells (DCs) promote adaptive immunity by cross-presenting antigen-based epitopes to CD8+ T cells. DCs process internalized protein antigens into peptides that enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and upload onto major histocompatibility type I (MHC-I) protein complexes for cell-surface transport and cross-presentation. Perplexingly, DCs often exhibit activation of the ER-stress sensor IRE1 in the absence of classical ER stress--leaving the underlying mechanism unexplained. Here we show that antigen-derived hydrophobic peptides directly engage ER-resident IRE1 by masquerading as unfolded proteins. Furthermore, IRE1 activation depletes MHC-I heavy-chain mRNAs through regulated IRE1-dependent decay (RIDD), thereby curtailing antigen cross-presentation. In tumor-bearing mice, IRE1 disruption increased MHC-I expression on tumor-infiltrating DCs, and enhanced recruitment and activation of CD8+ T cells. Moreover, IRE1 inhibition synergized with anti-PD-L1 antibody treatment to cause tumor regression. Our findings elucidate the mechanism and consequence of antigen-driven IRE1 activation in DCs, yielding a promising combination strategy for cancer immunotherapy.",

Very little is known about how the changing biophysical properties of the CSPGs are signalled to neurons. Here, we report Fibrinogen C Domain Containing 1 (FIBCD1), a known chitin-binding receptor of the innate immune system, to be highly expressed in the hippocampus and to specifically bind CSPGs containing 4-O sulphate modification (CS-4S). Cultured Fibcd1 knockout (KO) neurons lack phenotypic and transcriptomic responses to CSPG stimulation. Further, Fibcd1 KO mice exhibit accumulation of CS-4S, likely resulting in deficits of hippocampal-dependent learning tasks and abrogated synaptic remodelling, a phenotype rescued by enzymatic digestion of CSPGs. Likewise, neuronal specific knockdown of a Fibcd1 orthologue in flies results in neuronal morphological changes at the neuromuscular junctions and behavioural defects. Finally, we report two undiagnosed patients with a complex neurodevelopmental disorder with deleterious variants in FIBCD1, strongly implicating FIBCD1 in the development of the disease. Taken together, our results demonstrate that FIBCD1 is a novel, evolutionarily conserved component of ECM sulphation recognition that is crucial for neuronal development and function.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a debilitating and deadly disease characterized by low body mass index due to diminished food intake, and oftentimes concurrent hyperactivity. A high percentage of AN behavioral and metabolic phenotypes can be replicated in rodents given access to a voluntary running wheel and subject to food restriction, termed activity-based anorexia (ABA). Despite the well-documented body weight loss observed in AN human patients and ABA rodents, much less is understood regarding the neurobiological underpinnings of these maladaptive behaviors. Moreover, while exercise has been shown to diminish the activity of hunger-promoting hypothalamic agouti-related peptide (AgRP) neurons, much less is known regarding their activity and function in the mediation of food intake during ABA. Here, feeding microstructure analysis revealed ABA mice decreased food intake due to increased interpellet interval retrieval and diminished meal number. Longitudinal activity recordings of AgRP neurons in ABA animals revealed a maladaptive inhibitory response to food. We then demonstrated that ABA development or progression can be mitigated by chemogenetic AgRP activation through the reprioritization of food intake (increased meal number) over hyperactivity. These results elucidate a potential neural target for the amelioration of behavioral maladaptations present in AN patients.",

    "abstract": "The stingers of jellyfish, sea anemones and other cnidarians, known as nematocysts, are remarkable cellular weapons used for both predation and defense1. Nematocysts are specialized organelles which consist of a pressurized capsule containing a coiled harpoon-like thread2. These structures are in turn built within specialized cells known as nematocytes3. When triggered4, the capsule explosively discharges, ejecting the coiled thread which punctures the target and rapidly elongates by turning inside out in a process called eversion5,6. Due to the structural complexity of the thread and the extreme speed of discharge, the precise mechanics of nematocyst firing have remained elusive7. Here, using a combination of live and super-resolution imaging, 3D electron microscopy and genetic perturbations, we define the step-by-step sequence of nematocyst operation in the model sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. This analysis reveals the complex biomechanical transformations underpinning the operating mechanism of nematocysts, one of the natures most exquisite biological micro-machines. Further, this study will provide insight into the form and function of related cnidarian organelles and serve as a template for the design of bioinspired microdevices.",

    "abstract": "What is the genetic architecture of local adaptation and what is the geographic scale over which it operates? We investigated patterns of local and convergent adaptation in five sympatric population pairs of traditionally cultivated maize and its wild relative teosinte (Zea mays subsp. parviglumis). We found that signatures of local adaptation based on the inference of adaptive fixations and selective sweeps are frequently exclusive to individual populations, more so in teosinte compared to maize. However, for both maize and teosinte, selective sweeps are also frequently shared by several populations, and often between subspecies. We were further able to infer that selective sweeps were shared among populations most often via migration, though sharing via standing variation was also common. Our analyses suggest that teosinte has been a continued source of beneficial alleles for maize, even after domestication, and that maize populations have facilitated adaptation in teosinte by moving beneficial alleles across the landscape. Taken together, our results suggest local adaptation in maize and teosinte has an intermediate geographic scale, one that is larger than individual populations, but smaller than the species range.",

Consequently, people are required to wear masks and maintain a social distance to avoid spreading of the virus. Despite the success of the commercially available vaccines, the virus is still uncontained globally. Given the tropism of SARS-CoV-2, a mucosal immune reaction would help to reduce viral shedding and transmission locally. Only seven out of hundreds of ongoing clinical trials are testing the intranasal delivery of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nMethodsIn the current study, we tested in murine model the immunogenicity of a conventional vaccine platform based on virus-like particles (VLPs) displaying RBD of SARS-CoV-2 for intranasal vaccination. The candidate vaccine, CuMVTT-RBD, has been immunologically optimized to incorporate tetanus-toxin and is self-adjuvanted with TLR7/8 ligands.\n\nResultsCuMVTT-RBD elicited strong RBD- and spike- specific systemic IgG and IgA antibody responses of high avidity. Local immune responses were assessed and results demonstrate strong mucosal antibody and plasma cell production in lung tissue. The induced systemic antibodies could efficiently recognize and neutralize different Variants of Concerns of mutated SARS-CoV-2 RBDs.\n\nConclusionIn summary, intranasal vaccination with CuMVTT-RBD shows high immunogenicity and induces protective systemic and local specific antibody response against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants.\n\nOne sentence summaryEvaluation of an intransal administrated conventional VLP-based vaccine against COVID-19 in a murine model.",

    "abstract": "Most microorganisms exist in biofilms, which comprise aggregates of cells surrounded by an extracellular matrix that provides protection from external stresses. Based on the conditions under which they form, biofilm structures vary in significant ways. For instance, biofilms that develop when microbes are incubated under static conditions differ from those formed when microbes encounter the shear forces of a flowing liquid. Moreover, biofilms develop dynamically over time. Here, we describe a cost-effective, 3D-printed coverslip holder that facilitates surface adhesion assays under a broad range of standing and shaking culture conditions. This multi-panel adhesion (mPAD) mount further allows cultures to be sampled at multiple time points, ensuring consistency and comparability between samples and enabling analyses of the dynamics of biofilm formation. As a proof of principle, using the mPAD mount for shaking, oxic cultures, we confirm previous flow chamber experiments showing that Pseudomonas aeruginosa wild type and a phenazine deletion mutant ({Delta}phz) form similar biofilms. Extending this analysis to anoxic conditions, we reveal that microcolony and biofilm formation can only be observed under shaking conditions and are decreased in the {Delta}phz mutant compared to wild-type cultures, indicating that phenazines are crucial for the formation of biofilms if oxygen as an electron acceptor is not available. Furthermore, while the model archaeon Haloferax volcanii does not require archaella for attachment to surfaces under static conditions, we demonstrate that H. volcanii mutants that lack archaella are negatively affected in their early stages of biofilm formation under shaking conditions.\n\nImportanceDue to the versatility of the mPAD mount, we anticipate that it will aid the analysis of biofilm formation in a broad range of bacteria and archaea. Thereby, it contributes to answering critical biological questions about the regulatory and structural components of biofilm formation and understanding this process in a wide array of environmental, biotechnological, and medical contexts.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the host factors critical for Kaposis sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic replication can identify new targets for therapeutic intervention. Using pharmacological and genetic silencing approaches, we reveal for the first time that KSHV requires a B cell expressed voltage-gated K+ channel, Kv1.3, to enhance lytic replication. We show that the KSHV replication and transcription activator (RTA) protein upregulates Kv1.3 expression, leading to enhanced K+ channel activity and hyperpolarisation of the B cell membrane. Enhanced Kv1.3 activity then promotes intracellular Ca2+ influx through Cav3.2, a T-type Ca2+ channel, leading to the Ca2+ driven nuclear localisation of NFAT and the subsequent NFAT1-responsive gene expression. Importantly, KSHV lytic replication and infectious virion production could be inhibited by both Kv1.3 and Cav3.2 blockers or through Kv1.3 silencing. These findings provide new mechanistic insight into the essential role of host ion channels during KSHV infection and highlight Kv1.3 and Cav3.2 as new druggable host factors that are key to the successful completion of KSHV lytic replication.",

    "abstract": "The environmental microbiome harbors a vast repertoire of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) which can serve as evolutionary predecessors for ARGs found in pathogenic bacteria, or can be directly mobilized to pathogens in the presence of selection pressures. Thus, ARGs from benign environmental bacteria are an important resource for understanding clinically relevant resistance. Here, we conduct a comprehensive functional analysis of the Antibiotic_NAT family of aminoglycoside acetyltransferases. We determined a pan-family antibiogram of 21 Antibiotic_NAT enzymes, including 8 derived from clinical isolates and 13 from environmental metagenomic samples. We find that environment-derived representatives confer high-level, broad-spectrum resistance, including against the atypical aminoglycoside apramycin, and that a metagenome-derived gene likely is ancestral to an AAC(3) gene found in clinical isolates. Through crystallographic analysis, we rationalize the molecular basis for diversification of substrate specificity across the family. This work provides critical data on the molecular mechanism underpinning resistance to established and emergent aminoglycoside antibiotics and broadens our understanding of ARGs in the environment.",

    "abstract": "Streptococcus pyogenes is a leading cause of human morbidity and mortality, especially in resource limited settings. The World Health Organisation has recently made a vaccine for S. pyogenes a global health priority to reduce the burden of the post-infection rheumatic heart disease. For a vaccine to be active against all relevant strains in each region, molecular characterisation of circulating S. pyogenes isolates is needed. We performed extensive comparative whole genome analyses of S. pyogenes isolates from skin and soft tissue infections in The Gambia, West Africa, where there is a high burden of such infections. To act as a comparator to this low-income country (LIC) collection of isolates, we performed genome sequencing of isolates from skin infections in Sheffield, UK, as representative high-income country (HIC) isolates. LIC isolates from The Gambia were genetically more diverse (46 emm-types in 107 isolates) compared to HIC isolates from Sheffield (23 emm-types in 142 isolates), with only 7 overlapping emm-types and with diverse genetic backgrounds. Characterisation of other molecular markers indicated some shared features, including a high prevalence of the skin infection-associated emm-pattern D and the variable fibronectin-collagen-T antigen (FCT) types FCT-3 and FCT-4. A previously unidentified FCT (FCT-10) was identified in the LIC isolates, belonging to two different emm-types. A high proportion (79/107; 73.8%) of LIC isolates carried genes for tetracycline resistance, compared to 53/142 (37.3%) HIC isolates. There was also evidence of different circulating prophages, as very few prophage-associated DNases and lower numbers of superantigens were detected in LIC isolates. Our study provides much needed insight into the genetics of circulating isolates in a LIC (The Gambia), and how they differ from those circulating in HICs (Sheffield, UK). Common molecular features may act as bacterial drivers for specific infection types, regardless of the diverse genetic background.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 (CoV2) is the viral agent responsible for the pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Vaccines are being deployed all over the world with good efficacy, but there is no approved antiviral treatment to date. This is particularly needed since the emergence of variants and the potential immune escape may prolong pandemic spreading of the infection for much longer than anticipated. Here, we developed a series of small molecules and identified RG10 as a potent antiviral compound against SARS-CoV-2 in cell lines and human airway epithelia (HAE). RG10 localizes to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, perturbing ER morphology and inducing ER stress. Yet, RG10 does not associate with SARS-CoV-2 replication sites although preventing virus replication. To further investigate the antiviral properties of our compound, we developed fluorescent SARS-CoV-2 viral particles allowing us to track virus arrival to ER membranes. Live cell imaging of replication-competent virus infection revealed that RG10 stalls the intracellular virus-ER dynamics. Finally, we synthesized RG10b, a stable version of RG10, that showed increased potency in vitro and in HAE with a pharmacokinetic half-life greater than 2 h. Together, our work reports on a novel fluorescent virus model and innovative antiviral strategy consisting of the perturbation of ER/virus dynamics, highlighting the promising antiviral properties of RG10 and RG10b.",

    "abstract": "Thermoregulation is a physiological process by which a mammal regulates body temperature in response to its environment. Within the human body, thermoregulatory behaviors and metabolism are modulated by circulating metabolic factors. In our study, we tested the ability of the neuropeptide spexin, which shares sequence homology to galanin, to regulate these functions in female mice. Supraphysiological levels of spexin in C57BL/6 mice were insufficient to protect against diet-induced obesity after 50 days of treatment. Behavioral analysis of long-term spexin treatment appeared to modulate anxiety-like behaviors by promoting exploratory behaviors and thermoregulatory behaviors of nest building that ceased when animals were housed at thermoneutral temperatures. Upon examination of the molecular profile of brown and white adipose tissue, treatment disrupted the thermogenic profile of white adipose tissue, in which {beta}3-adrenergic receptor expression was downregulated.

Then, we examined the AQP1b promoter region and observed several transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) for nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), SRY-box, c-AMP responsive element binding protein (CREB), GATA binding factor, and hepatic nuclear factor-1. Interestingly, mmAQP1b transcription was differentially modulated by heavy metal or immunostimulant challenge. Further studies to deepen the knowledge of fish AQP-mediated adaptation response potentially relevant to molecular pathogenesis are warranted.\n\nSummary statementWe identified mud loach AQP1b transcript variants and consensus sequences involved in stress or innate immunity in promotor region.

    "abstract": "The recent emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants has caused considerable concern due to reduced vaccine efficacy and escape from neutralizing antibody therapeutics. It is therefore paramount to develop therapeutic strategies that inhibit all known and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we report that all SARS-CoV-2 variants analyzed, including variants of concern (VOC) Alpha, Beta, Gamma, and Delta, exhibit enhanced binding affinity to clinical grade and phase 2 tested recombinant human soluble ACE2 (APN01). Importantly, soluble ACE2 neutralized infection of VeroE6 cells and human lung epithelial cells by multiple VOC strains with markedly enhanced potency when compared to reference SARS-CoV-2 isolates. Effective inhibition of infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants was validated and confirmed in two independent laboratories. These data show that SARS-CoV-2 variants that have emerged around the world, including current VOC and several variants of interest, can be inhibited by soluble ACE2, providing proof of principle of a pan-SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic.",

Here, we report that CD19-CAR T cells upregulated several key phosphorylation events also observed in canonical T cell receptor (TCR) signaling while Raji B cells exhibited a significant decrease in B cell receptor-signaling related phosphorylation events in response to coculture. Our data suggest that CD19-CAR stimulation activates a mixture of unique CD19-CAR-specific signaling pathways and canonical TCR signaling while global phosphorylation in Raji B cells is reduced after association with the CD19-CAR T cells.",

Resin gathering activities were concentered between 10 and 14 hours, with a moderate linear positive correlation index with the temperature. No bee activity was observed when temperatures were below 16.69{degrees}C. Gathering suffered extreme reduction during winter and greater activity in summer.

Here we describe the effects of the maintenance of two distinct Wolbachia infections, one each from supergroups A and B, on the parasitoid host Nasonia vitripennis. We compare the effect of Wolbachia infections on various traits between the uninfected, single A infected, single B infected, and the double infected strains with their cured versions. Contrary to the previous reports, our results suggest that there is a significant cost associated with the maintenance of Wolbachia infections where traits like family size, fecundity, longevity, and rates of male copulation are compromised in Wolbachia infected strains. The double infected and supergroup B infection strains show higher Wolbachia titer than supergroup A. The double infected Wolbachia strain has the most detrimental impact on the host as compared to single infections. Moreover, there is a supergroup-specific negative impact on these wasps as the supergroup B infections elicit the most pronounced negative effects. These findings raise important questions on the mechanism of survival and maintenance of these reproductive parasites in arthropod hosts.",

This is a fascinating idea that so far has limited empirical justification. Here Drosophila melanogaster lines from a large-scale artificial selection experiment, where we selected for stress resistance traits and for longevity, were used to test the hologenome hypothesis. We raised flies from all selection regimes, including a regime where flies were kept at benign standard laboratory condition (control regime) throughout the duration of the experiment, under common garden conditions and sequenced the microbiome of the flies. We found abundant differences in microbial communities between control and selection regimes, but not between replicate lines within the regimes, and microbial diversity was higher in selected relative to control lines. Several major core Drosophila bacterial species were differentially abundant in the different selection regimes despite flies being exposed to similar nutritional and general environmental conditions. Our results support the idea that the host and microbiome genomes have evolved in concert and provide experimental support for the hologenome theory of evolution.",

    "abstract": "The reduction of multi-allelic polymorphisms to variants with fewer alleles, two in the limit, is addressed. The Hardy-Weinberg law is shown to be transitive in the sense that a multi-allelic polymorphism that is in equilibrium will retain its equilibrium status if any allele together with its corresponding genotypes is deleted from the population. Similarly, the transitivity principle also applies if alleles are joined, which leads to the summation of allele frequencies and their corresponding genotype frequencies. These basic polymorphism properties are intuitive, but they have apparently not been formalized or investigated. This article provides a straightforward proof of the transitivity principle, and its usefulness in practical genetic data analysis with multi-allelic markers is explored. In general, results of statistical tests for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium obtained with polymorphisms that are reduced by deletion or joining of alleles are seen to be consistent with the formulated transitivity principle. We also show how the transitivity principle allows one to identify equilibrium-offending alleles, and how it can provide clues to genotyping problems and evolutionary changes. For microsatellites, which are widely used in forensics, the transitivity principle implies one expects similar results for statistical tests that use length-based and sequence-based alleles. High-quality autosomal microsatellite databases of the US National Institute of Standards and Technology are used to illustrate the use of the transitivity principle in testing both length-based and sequence-based microsatellites for Hardy-Weinberg proportions. Test results for Hardy-Weinberg proportions for the two types of microsatellites are seen to be largely consistent and can detect allele imbalance.",

In this study, we determined the whole-genome sequences of five Madagascar house mice captured from the wild. We examined the evolutionary history of the population by analyzing the mitochondrial and autosomal genomes. We confirmed that the mitochondrial genome lineages of Madagascar house mice formed a monophyletic clade placed at one of the most basal positions in the species. An analysis of autosomal genomic sequences indicates that the Madagascar house mice are genetically members of M. m. castaneus (CAS), but also contain genetic elements of M. m. domesticus (DOM) resulting from hybridization between subspecies. The signature of a strong population bottleneck 1000-3000 years ago was observed in both mitochondrial and autosomal genomic data. All samples showed strong genetic affinity to many CAS samples across a wide range of Indian Ocean coastal and island regions, with divergence time estimated around 4000 years ago. These findings support that the Madagascar house mice started to colonize the island with human agricultural activity, and experienced complex history for the establishment.",

    "abstract": "Regulation of translation is a fundamental facet of the cellular response to rapidly changing external conditions. Specific RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) co-ordinate the translational regulation of distinct mRNA cohorts during stress. To identify RBPs with previously under-appreciated roles in translational control, we used polysome profiling and mass spectrometry to identify and quantify proteins associated with translating ribosomes in unstressed yeast cells and during oxidative stress and amino acid starvation, which both induce the integrated stress response (ISR). Over 800 proteins were identified across polysome gradient fractions, including ribosomal proteins, translation factors and many others without previously described translation-related roles, including numerous metabolic enzymes. We identified variations in patterns of polysome enrichment in both unstressed and stressed cells and identified proteins enriched in heavy polysomes during stress. Genetic screening of polysome-enriched RBPs identified the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase, Aat2, as a ribosome-associated protein whose deletion conferred growth sensitivity to oxidative stress. Loss of Aat2 caused aberrantly high activation of the ISR via enhanced eIF2 phosphorylation and GCN4 activation. Importantly, non-catalytic AAT2 mutants retained polysome association and did not show heightened stress sensitivity. Aat2 therefore has a separate ribosome-associated translational regulatory or  moonlighting function that modulates the ISR independent of its aspartate aminotransferase activity.",

The assay is utilized to study CRY variants with residue substitutions in the flavin pocket and correlate their TIM affinities with CTT undocking, as measured by pulse-dipolar ESR spectroscopy and evaluated by molecular dynamics simulations. CRY variants with the CTT removed or undocked bind TIM constitutively, whereas those incapable of photoreduction bind TIM weakly. In response to flavin redox state, two conserved histidine residues contribute to a robust on/off switch by mediating CTT interactions with the flavin pocket and TIM.

The platform delivers a limit of detection (LOD) 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than previous reports, but in line with the concentrations range (pg/ml to ng/ml) of these opioid metabolites present in real samples. To enable multianalyte detection we developed a facile, reproducible, and high yield fabrication process producing twenty G-FETs with integrated side gate platinum (Pt) electrodes on a single chip. Our devices achieved the simultaneous and selective multianalyte detection of three different metabolites: Noroxycodone (NX), 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP), and Norfentanyl (NF) in wastewater.",

    "abstract": "PurposeGlioblastoma (GBM) is a lethal disease characterized by inevitable recurrence. Here we investigate the molecular pathways mediating resistance, with the goal of identifying therapeutic opportunities to target this tumor.\n\nExperimental DesignWe developed a longitudinal in vivo recurrence model utilizing patient-derived explants to produce paired specimens (pre- and post-recurrence) following temozolomide(TMZ) and radiation(IR). These specimens were evaluated for treatment response and to identify gene expression pathways driving treatment resistance. Findings were clinically validated using spatial transcriptomics of human GBMs.\n\nResultsThese studies reveal in replicate cohorts, a gene expression profile characterized by upregulation of mesenchymal and stem-like genes at recurrence. Analyses of clinical databases revealed increased expression of this transcriptional profile to be significantly associated with worse median overall survival (248 days vs 430 days, p=0.0004), and upregulation of this profile at recurrence. Most notably, we identified upregulation of TGF{beta} signaling, and more than one-hundred-fold increase in THY1 levels at recurrence. Utilizing cell sorting, we observed that THY1-positive cells represented <10% of cells in the treatment-naive tumors and 75-96% in the recurrent tumors. We then isolated THY1-positive cells from treatment-naive patient samples and determined that they were inherently resistant to chemoradiation in orthotopic models. Additionally, using image-guided biopsies from treatment-naive human GBM, we conducted spatial transcriptomic analyses. This revealed rare THY1+ regions characterized by mesenchymal/stem-like gene expression, analogous to our recurrent mouse model samples, which co-localized with macrophages within the perivascular niche. Since TGF{beta} signaling contributes to a mesenchymal/stem-like phenotype, we inhibited TGF{beta}RI activity in vivo which resulted in decreased mesenchymal/stem-like protein levels, including THY1, and restored sensitivity to TMZ/IR in recurrent tumors.\n\nConclusionsThese findings reveal that GBM recurrence may result from tumor repopulation by pre-existing, therapy-resistant, THY1-positive, mesenchymal/stem-like cells within the perivascular niche. Furthermore, our data demonstrate the promise of targeting upregulated pathways in resistant subclones as a novel mechanism to achieve therapeutic response, and specifically that THY1 expression may represent a biomarker of response to TGF{beta} inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) seed oil, which accumulates in the embryo, and mucilage, which is synthesized in the seed coat, are of great economic importance for food, pharmaceutical as well as chemical industries. Theories on the link between oil and mucilage production in seeds consist in the spatio-temporal competition of both compounds for photosynthates during the very early stages of seed development. In this study, we demonstrate a positive relationship between seed oil production and seed coat mucilage extrusion in the agronomic model, flax. Three recombinant inbred lines were selected for low, medium and high mucilage and seed oil contents. Metabolite and transcript profiling (1H NMR and DNA oligo-microarrays) was performed on the seeds during seed development. These analyses showed main changes in the seed coat transcriptome during the mid-phase of seed development (25 Days Post-Anthesis), once the mucilage biosynthesis and modification processes are thought to be finished. These transcriptome changes comprised genes that are putatively involved in mucilage chemical modification and oil synthesis, as well as gibberellic acid (GA) metabolism. The results of these integrative biology approach, suggest that transcriptional regulations of seed oil and fatty acid (FA) metabolism could occur in the seed coat during the mid-stage of seed development, once the seed coat carbon supplies have been used for mucilage biosynthesis and mechanochemical properties of the mucilage secretory cells.",

    "abstract": "Although growing evidence shows that microRNA (miRNA) regulates plant growth and development, miRNA regulatory networks in plants are not well understood. Current experimental studies cannot characterize miRNA regulatory networks on a large scale. This information gap provides a good opportunity to employ computational methods for global analysis and to generate useful models and hypotheses. To address this opportunity, we collected miRNA-target interactions (MTIs) and used MTIs from Arabidopsis thaliana and Medicago truncatula to predict homologous MTIs in soybeans, resulting in 80,235 soybean MTIs in total. A multi-level iterative bi-clustering method was developed to identify 483 soybean miRNA-target regulatory modules (MTRMs). Furthermore, we collected soybean miRNA expression data and corresponding gene expression data in response to abiotic stresses. By clustering these data, 37 MTRMs related to abiotic stresses were identified including stress-specific MTRMs and shared MTRMs. These MTRMs have gene ontology (GO) enrichment in resistance response, iron transport, positive growth regulation, etc. Our study predicts soybean miRNA-target regulatory modules with high confidence under different stresses, constructs miRNA-GO regulatory networks for MTRMs under different stresses and provides miRNA targeting hypotheses for experimental study. The method can be applied to other biological processes and other plants to elucidate miRNA co-regulation mechanisms.",

    "abstract": "As the focus for CRISPR edited plants moves from proof-of-concept to real world applications, precise gene manipulation will increasingly require concurrent multiplex editing for polygenic traits. A common approach for editing across multiple sites is to design one gRNA per target; however, this complicates construct assembly and increases the possibility of off-target mutations. In this study, we utilized one gRNA to target MYB186, a known positive trichome regulator, as well as its paralogs MYB138 and MYB38 at a consensus site for mutagenesis in Populus tremula x P. alba INRA 717-1B4. Unexpected duplications of MYB186 and MYB138 resulted in a total of eight alleles for the three targeted genes in the hybrid poplar. Deep sequencing and PCR analyses confirmed editing across all eight targets in nearly all of the resultant glabrous mutants, ranging from small indels to large genomic dropouts, with no off-target activity detected at four potential sites. This highlights the effectiveness of a single gRNA targeting conserved exonic regions for multiplex editing. Additionally, cuticular wax and whole leaf analyses showed a complete absence of triterpenes in the trichomeless mutants, hinting at a previously undescribed role for the non-glandular trichomes of poplar.\n\nONE SENTENCE SUMMARYTargeting conserved sequences with a single gRNA allowed efficient mutagenesis of a multigene family and the recovery of trichomeless and triterpene-free poplar mutants.",

    "abstract": "The rapid (R)-type anion channel plays a central role in controlling stomatal closure in plant guard cells, thus regulating the exchange of water and photosynthetic gas (CO2) in response to environmental stimuli. The activity of the R- type anion channel is regulated by malate. However, the molecular basis of the R-type anion channel activity remains elusive. Here, we describe the first cryo-EM structure of the R-type anion channel QUAC1 at 3.5 [A] resolution in the presence of malate. The structure reveals that the QUAC1 is a symmetrical dimer, forming a single electropositive T-shaped pore for passing anions across the membrane. The transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are assembled into a twisted bi-layer architecture, with the associated dimeric interfaces nearly perpendicular. Our structural and functional analyses reveal that QUAC1 functions as an inward rectifying anion channel and suggests a mechanism for malate-mediated channel activation. Altogether, our study uncovers the molecular basis for a novel class of anion channels and provides insights into the gating and modulation of the R-type anion channel.",

During lateral root formation in Arabidopsis thaliana, the endodermis is actively remodeled to allow outgrowth of the new organ. Here, we show that microtubule arrays facing lateral root founder cells display a higher order compared to arrays on the opposite wall of the same cell, and this asymmetry is required for endodermal remodeling and lateral root initiation. We identify that MICROTUBULE ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 70-5 is necessary for the establishment of this spatially defined microtubule organization and endodermis remodeling, and thus contributes to lateral root morphogenesis. We propose that MAP70-5 and cortical microtubule arrays in the endodermis integrate the mechanical signals generated by lateral root outgrowth, facilitating the channeling of organogenesis.",

The macrophage, a key component of the innate immune system, is the first line of defence against many infectious agents and plays a major role in shaping the adaptive immune response. However, this phagocyte is a target and host for many pathogens. Understanding the molecular basis of interactions between macrophages and pathogens is therefore crucial for the development of effective strategies to combat important infectious diseases. We explored how pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) can provide a limitless in vitro supply of genetically and experimentally tractable macrophages from livestock. Porcine and bovine PSC-derived macrophages (PSCdMs) exhibited molecular and functional characteristics of ex vivo primary macrophages. Pig PSCdMs were productively infected by Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) and African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV), two of the most economically important and devastating viruses in pig farming. Moreover, Pig PSCdMs were readily amenable to genetic modification by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing applied in parental stem cells, or directly by lentiviral vector transduction. PSCs and differentiated derivatives therefore provide a useful and ethical experimental platform to investigate the genetic and molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions in livestock.",

    "abstract": "Upon their activation, naive CD8 T cells divide and differentiate into short-lived effector cells, relevant for exerting immune control, and long-lived memory cells, relevant for long-term immunity. The proportion of memory cells generated depends highly on the context of activation and whether the activated cell divides symmetrically or asymmetrically. However, how T cells control the extent of their asymmetry during their first division in response to contextual signals is not known. Using fluorescence loss in photo-bleaching (FLIP) experiments, we show that the metabolic and plasma membrane asymmetry of mitotic T cells depend on the regulated assembly of a lateral diffusion barrier in their endoplasmic reticulum (ER-) membrane. In asymmetrically dividing T cells, the degrees of asymmetry correlated tightly to barrier strength, whereas symmetrically dividing T cells did not establish such a barrier. Direct positive or negative interference with barrier assembly enhanced or abrogated metabolic and plasma membrane asymmetry, respectively, indicating that barrier strength is a direct and decisive determinant of mitotic asymmetry. Thus, together our data identify diffusion barrier-mediated compartmentalization as a mechanism for how asymmetric T cell regulate their long-term response as a function of the activatory context.",

    "abstract": "Shank genes are implicated in ~1% of people with autism and mice with Shank3 knock out mutations exhibit autism-like behaviours. Zinc deficiency and gastrointestinal problems can be common among people with autism, and zinc is a key element required for SHANK protein function and gut development. In Shank3B-/- mice, a supplementary zinc diet reverses autism behaviours. We hypothesise that dietary zinc may alter the gut microbiome, potentially affecting the gut-microbiome-brain axis, which may contribute to changes in autism-like behaviours. To test this, four types of gastrointestinal samples (ileum, caecum, colon, faecal) were collected from wild-type and knock-out Shank3B-/- mice on either control or supplemented-zinc diets. Cage, genotype and zinc diet each contributed significantly to bacterial community variation (accounting for 12.8%, 3.9% and 2.3% of the variation, respectively). Fungal diversity differed significantly between wild-type and knock-out Shank3B-/- mice on the control zinc diet, and the fungal biota differed among gut locations. RNA-seq analysis of host (mouse) transcripts revealed differential expression of genes involved in host metabolism that may be regulated by the gut microbiota and genes involved in anti-microbial interactions. By utilising the Shank3B-/- knock-out mouse model we were able to examine the influence of - and interactions between - dietary zinc and ASD-linked host genotype. These data broaden understanding of the gut microbiome in autism and pave the way towards potential microbial therapeutics for gastrointestinal problems in people with autism.\n\nImportancePreviously, supplemental dietary zinc in the Shank3B-/- mouse model of autism spectrum disorder resulted in observations of ASD behaviours reversal; in this study we also used the Shank3B-/- mouse model to examine the influence of - and interaction between - dietary zinc and ASD-linked host genotype. Sample location along the gastrointestinal tract, genotype and zinc diet explained some of the variation in the microbiota data, with notable bacterial differences between treatment groups. Differential expression of host genes between treatment groups, including antimicrobial interaction genes and gut microbiota-regulated host metabolism genes, suggests that the interplay between gut microbes, the gastrointestinal tract and the brain may play a major role towards the observed amelioration of ASD behaviours seen previously with supplemented dietary zinc. These results widen the scope towards manipulating both dietary zinc and the microbiota itself to ameliorate ASD-related behaviours and associated gastrointestinal issues.",

    "abstract": "Tumor suppressor p53 plays a central role in preventing tumorigenesis. Here, we unravel how p53 modulates mitochondrial dynamics to restrain the metastatic properties of cancer cells. p53 inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling to attenuate the protein level of mitochondrial fission process 1 (MTFP1), which fosters the pro-fission dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation. This regulatory mechanism allows p53 to restrict cell migration and invasion governed by Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission. Downregulating p53 expression or elevating the molecular signature of mitochondrial fission correlates with aggressive tumor phenotypes and poor prognosis in cancer patients. Upon p53 loss, exaggerated mitochondrial fragmentation stimulates the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling resulting in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-like changes in cell morphology, accompanied by accelerated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression and invasive cell migration. Notably, blocking the activation of mTORC1/MTFP1/Drp1/ERK1/2 axis completely abolishes the p53 deficiency-driven cellular morphological switch, MMP9 expression, and cancer cell dissemination. Our findings unveil a hitherto unrecognized mitochondria-dependent molecular mechanism underlying the metastatic phenotypes of p53-compromised cancers.",

    "abstract": "Lack of oxygen (hypoxia and anoxia) is detrimental to cell function and survival and underlies many disease conditions. Hence, metazoans have evolved mechanisms to adapt to low oxygen. One such mechanism, metabolic suppression, decreases the cellular demand for oxygen by downregulating ATP-demanding processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptation are poorly understood. Here, we report on the role of ndrg1a in hypoxia adaptation of the anoxia-tolerant zebrafish embryo. ndrg1a is expressed in the kidney and ionocytes, cell types that use large amounts of ATP to maintain ion homeostasis. ndrg1a mutants are viable and develop normally when raised under normal oxygen. However, their survival and kidney function is reduced relative to WT embryos following exposure to prolonged anoxia. We further demonstrate that Ndrg1a binds to the energy-demanding sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) pump under anoxia and is required for its degradation, which may preserve ATP in the kidney and ionocytes and contribute to energy homeostasis. Lastly, we show that sodium azide treatment, which increased lactate levels, was sufficient to trigger NKA degradation in an Ndrg1a-dependent manner. These findings support a model whereby Ndrg1a is essential for hypoxia adaptation and functions downstream of lactate signaling to induce NKA degradation, a process known to conserve cellular energy.",

Currently, there are no structural studies of any of its enzymes, being the determination of the three-dimensional (3D) structure of PiGlcK-1 a necessary contribution in the deduction of its functions, its interaction with ligands, and possible regulatory mechanisms. In this work we present the first structural model obtained by in silico tools for PiGlcK-1. For the prediction of this model, different algorithms were used to find the best annealing, refinement, and qualitative evaluation of them. A structural comparison of the predicted model with other structures of crystallized kinase enzymes allowed us to identify the regions of interaction with their classical substrates (glucose and ATP), as well as to identify the amino acid residues involved in the binding of other substrates such as fructose and ADP. In addition, we propose a possible recognition region of PPi, an activator of kinase activity that includes the GXGE motif, conserved in enzymes of the ribokinase (RK) family, which distinguishes this PiGlcK-1 from a classical glucokinase. Accordingly, these findings suggest PPi-binding motif as potential targets for the development of inhibitors of PiGlcK-1 activity.",

    "abstract": "This paper examines how to reduce the number of control animals in preclinical hyperinsulemic glucose clamp studies if we make use of information on historical studies. A data set consisting of 59 studies in rats to investigate new insulin analogues for diabetics, collected in the years 2000 to 2015, is analysed. A simulation experiment is performed based on a carefully built nonlinear mixed-effects model including historical information, comparing results (for the relative log-potency) with the standard approach ignoring previous studies. We find that by including historical information in the form of the mixed-effects model proposed, we can to remove between 23% and 51% of the control rats in the two studies looked closely upon to get the same level of precision on the relative log-potency as in the standard analysis. How to incorporate the historical information in the form of the mixed-effects model is discussed, where both a meta approach as well as a Bayesian approach are suggested. The conclusions are similar for the two approaches, and therefore, we conclude that the inclusion of historical information is beneficial in regard to using fewer control rats.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWRegulated cell death is essential for the maintenance of cellular and tissue homeostasis. In the hematopoietic system, genetic defects in apoptotic cell death generally produce the accumulation of immune cells, inflammation and autoimmunity. In contrast, we found that genetic deletion of caspases of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway reduces natural killer (NK) cell numbers and makes NK cells functionally defective in vivo and in vitro. Caspase deficiency results in constitutive activation of a type I interferon (IFN) response, due to leakage of mitochondrial DNA and activation of the cGAS/STING pathway. The NK cell defect in caspase-deficient mice is independent of the type I IFN response, but the phenotype is partially rescued by cGAS or STING deficiency. Finally, caspase deficiency alters NK cells in a cell-extrinsic manner. Type I IFNs and NK cells are two essential effectors of antiviral immunity, and our results demonstrate that they are both regulated in a caspase-dependent manner. Beyond caspase-deficient animals, our observations may have implications in infections that trigger mitochondrial stress and caspase-dependent cell death.",

    "abstract": "Monitoring the density of natural populations is crucial for ecosystem management decision making and natural resource management. The most widely used method to measure the population density of animal and plant species in natural habitats is to count organisms in sample plots. Yet evaluation of survey performance by different sample plot shapes, e.g. quadrats compared with transects, has been largely neglected since the 1990s and has not been undertaken using simulation. Simulating populations and surveys, we evaluated population density measurement precision for 900 cases, testing 30 sample plot survey designs in each of 30 spatially clustered populations. We varied three design options: elongation of plot shape while keeping sample area constant, systematic or random plot allocation, and sample size. Survey design performance varied markedly: elongating the plot shape always improved survey precision; allocating plots systematically sometimes did. (i) Averaged across all tested populations, elongated (1:100) transect plot shapes were 2-to-3 times more precise than square (10:10) quadrats. (ii) The precision of systematic surveys accelerated with sample plot number, increasing faster than the (known) linear increase under simple random sampling. This non-linear, concave upward, dependence of systematic precision on sample size has not previously been reported. (iii) The most precise design we evaluated used long narrow transects allocated systematically. Averaging among all 30 tested populations, a researcher would need 600 random square (10:10) quadrats to equal the precision achieved by 100 systematic (1:100) transects. Finding this average efficiency difference of 600% for a survey sample size of 100 plots, these simulation results imply that field trips requiring five sampling days using random quadrats could achieve equal precision in one or two days using systematic elongated transects. For all clustered populations we tested, long narrow transects resulted in a more efficient design for sample plot survey.",

We included the seven new species of Bruggmanniella described between 2019 and 2020, and discuss some aspects of the evolutionary changes among the closely related genera Bruggmanniella, Pseudasphondylia, and Illiciomyia. Bruggmanniella is confirmed here as a monophyletic Neotropical lineage, divergent from the Asian species. The phylogenetic reconstruction hypothesized here reinforces the pertinence of the genus Odontokeros to house all species occurring in the Oriental/Palearctic region under Bruggmanniella. The delimitation of Bruggmanniella, the geographical distribution, and niche occupation are discussed.",
