    "abstract": "Mechanical signals from the extracellular microenvironment have been implicated in tumor and metastatic progression. Here, we identified nucleoporin NUP210 as a metastasis susceptibility gene for human estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer and a cellular mechanosensor. Nup210 depletion suppresses lung metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer. Mechanistically, NUP210 interacts with LINC complex protein SUN2 which connects the nucleus to the cytoskeleton. In addition, the NUP210/SUN2 complex interacts with chromatin via the short isoform of BRD4 and histone H3.1/H3.2 at the nuclear periphery. In Nup210 knockout cells, mechanosensitive genes accumulate H3K27me3 heterochromatin modification, mediated by the polycomb repressive complex 2 and differentially reposition within the nucleus. Transcriptional repression in Nup210 knockout cells results in defective mechanotransduction and focal adhesion necessary for their metastatic capacity. Our study provides a new insight into the role of nuclear pore protein in cellular mechanosensation and metastasis.",

    "abstract": "The discovery of extremophiles helped enable the development of groundbreaking technology such as polymerase chain reaction. Temperature variation is often an essential step of these technology platforms, but the effect of temperature on the error rate of polymerases from different origins is under-explored. Here, we applied high-throughput sequencing to profile the error rates of DNA polymerases from psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic origins with single-molecule resolution. We found that reaction temperature substantially increases substitution and deletion error rates of psychrophilic and mesophilic DNA polymerases. Our motif analysis shows that the substitution error profiles cluster according to phylogenetic similarity of polymerases, not reaction temperature, thus suggesting that reaction temperature increases global error rate of polymerases independent of sequence context. Intriguingly, we also found that the DNA polymerase I of a psychrophilic bacteria exhibits higher polymerization activity than its mesophilic ortholog across all temperature ranges, including down to -19{degrees}C which is well below the freezing temperature of water. Our results provide a useful reference for how reaction temperature, a crucial parameter of biochemistry, can affect DNA polymerase fidelity in organisms adapted to a wide range of thermal environments.",

    "abstract": "Transgenerational transmission of epiphenotypes is poorly understood. Here we show that exposure of pregnant mouse F0 females to BPA results in obesity in the F2 progeny due to increased food intake and leptin resistance. This epiphenotype can be transmitted up to the F6 generation and disappears in F7. Analyses of chromatin accessibility in sperm of the F1-F6 generations reveals alterations in the binding of CTCF at two enhancers of the Fto gene in obese but not control animals that correlates with transmission of obesity. Deletion of the CTCF site in Fto results in mice that fail to become obese when exposed to BPA. These Fto enhancers show increased interactions in sperm of obese mice with the Irx3 and Irx5 genes, which are involved in the differentiation of appetite controlling AgRP/NPY neurons. Single-nucleus and immunofluorescence analyses in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus suggest that exposure to BPA results in expansion of the number of orexigenic AgRP neurons. This expansion correlates with increased accessibility of the Fto proximal enhancer in radial glia-like neural stem cells (RG-NSCs), which give rise to AgRP/NPY neurons, and in mature oligodendrocytes. The results provide a molecular mechanism for transgenerational inheritance in mammals and suggest that both genetic and epigenetic alterations of Fto can lead to the same phenotypic outcomes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMicrobial transmission from parent to offspring is hypothesized to be widespread in vertebrates. However, evidence for this is limited as many evolutionarily important clades remain unexamined. There is currently no data on the microbiota associated with any Chondrichthyan species during embryonic development, despite the global distribution, ecological importance, and phylogenetic position of this clade. In this study, we take the first steps towards filling this gap by investigating the microbiota associated with embryonic development in the little skate, Leucoraja erinacea, a common North Atlantic species and popular system for chondrichthyan biology.\n\nMethodsTo assess the potential for bacterial transmission in an oviparous chondrichthyan, we used 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to characterize the microbial communities associated with the skin, gill, and egg capsule of the little skate, at six points during ontogeny. Community composition was analyzed using the QIIME2 pipeline and microbial continuity between stages was tracked using FEAST.\n\nResultsWe identify site-specific and stage-specific microbiota dominated by the bacterial phyla Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. This composition is similar to, but distinct from, that of previously published data on the adult microbiota of other chondrichthyan species. Our data reveal that the skate egg capsule harbors a highly diverse bacterial community-particularly on the internal surface of the capsule-and facilitates intergenerational microbial transfer to the offspring. Embryonic skin and external gill tissues host similar bacterial communities; the skin and gill communities later diverge as the internal gills and skin denticles develop.\n\nConclusionsOur study is the first exploration of the chondrichthyan microbiota throughout ontogeny and provides the first evidence of vertical transmission in this group.",

    "abstract": "Cold active esterases represent an important class of enzymes capable of undertaking useful chemical transformations at low temperatures. EstN7 from Bacillus cohnii represents a true psychrophilic esterase with a temperature optimum below 20{degrees}C. We have recently determined the structure of EstN7 and have used this knowledge to understand substrate specificity and expands its substrate range through protein engineering. Substrate range is determined by a plug at the end of acyl binding pocket that blocks access to a buried water filled cavity, so limiting EstN7 to turnover of C2 and C4 substrates. Data mining revealed a potentially important commercial reaction, conversion of triacetin to only the 1,2-glyceryl diacetate isomer, which the EstN7 could achieve. Residues M187, N211 and W206 were identified as plug residues. M187 was identified as the key plug residue but mutation to alanine destabilised the structure as whole. Another plug mutation, N211A had a stabilising effect on EstN7 and suppressed the destabilising M187A mutation. The M187A-N211A variant had the broadest substrate range, capable of hydrolysing a C8 substrate. Thus, the structure of EstN7 together with focused engineering has provided new insights into the structural stability and substrate specificity that allowed expansion of substrate range.",

    "abstract": "Acoustic signals serve communication within and across species throughout the animal kingdom. Studying the genetics, evolution, and neurobiology of acoustic communication requires annotating acoustic signals: segmenting and identifying individual acoustic elements like syllables or sound pulses. To be useful, annotations need to be accurate, robust to noise, and fast.\n\nWe here introduce DAS, a method that annotates acoustic signals across species based on a deep-learning derived hierarchical presentation of sound. We demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and speed of DAS using acoustic signals with diverse characteristics from insects, birds, and mammals. DAS comes with a graphical user interface for annotating song, training the network, and for generating and proofreading annotations. The method can be trained to annotate signals from new species with little manual annotation and can be combined with unsupervised methods to discover novel signal types. DAS annotates song with high throughput and low latency, allowing realtime annotations for closed-loop experimental interventions. Overall, DAS is a universal, versatile, and accessible tool for annotating acoustic communication signals.",

    "abstract": "Populations often inhabit multiple ecological patches and thus experience divergent selection, which can lead to local adaptation if migration is not strong enough to swamp locally adapted alleles. Conditions for the establishment of a locally advantageous allele have been studied in randomly mating populations. However, many species reproduce, at least partially, through self-fertilization, and how selfing affects local adaptation remains unclear and debated. Using a two-patch branching process formalism, we obtained a closed-form approximation under weak selection for the probability of establishment of a locally advantageous allele (P) for arbitrary selfing rate and dominance level, where selection is allowed to act on viability or fecundity, and migration can occur via seed or pollen dispersal. This solution is compared to diffusion approximation and used to investigate the consequences of a shift in a mating system on P, and the establishment of protected polymorphism. We find that selfing can either increase or decrease P, depending on the patterns of dominance in the two patches, and has conflicting effects on local adaptation. Globally, selfing favors local adaptation when locally advantageous alleles are (partially) recessive, when selection between patches is asymmetrical and when migration occurs through pollen rather than seed dispersal. These results establish a rigorous theoretical background to study heterogeneous selection and local adaptation in partially selfing species.",

Our data show that SETD1A haploinsufficiency resulted in morphologically increased dendritic complexity and functionally increased bursting activity. This network phenotype was primarily driven by SETD1A haploinsufficiency in glutamatergic neurons. In accordance with the functional changes, transcriptomic profiling revealed perturbations in gene sets associated with glutamatergic synaptic function. At the molecular level, we identified specific changes in the cAMP/PKA pathway pointing toward a hyperactive cAMP pathway in SETD1A+/- neurons. Finally, by pharmacologically targeting the cAMP pathway we were able to rescue the network deficits in SETD1A+/- cultures. Our results demonstrate a link between SETD1A and the cAMP-dependent pathway in human neurons.",

    "abstract": "Many eukaryotic genes contain alternative promoters with distinct expression patterns. How these promoters are differentially regulated remains elusive. Here, we apply single-molecule imaging to quantify the transcriptional regulation of two alternative promoters (P1 and P2) of the Bicoid (Bcd) target gene hunchback in syncytial blastoderm Drosophila embryos. Contrary to the previous notion that Bcd only activates P2, we find that Bcd activates both promoters via the same two enhancers. P1 activation is less frequent and requires binding of more Bcd molecules than P2 activation. Using a theoretical model to relate promoter activity to enhancer states, we show that the two promoters follow common transcription kinetics driven by sequential Bcd binding at the two enhancers. Bcd binding at either enhancer primarily activates P2, while P1 activation relies more on Bcd binding at both enhancers. These results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the kinetic mechanisms of complex eukaryotic gene regulation.",

    "abstract": "Choice selection strategies and decision making are typically investigated using multiple-choice gambling paradigms that require participants to maximize reward payoff. However, research shows that performance in such paradigms suffers from individual biases towards the frequency of gains to choose smaller local gains over larger longer term gain, also referred to as melioration. Here, we developed a simple two-choice reward task, implemented in 186 healthy human adult subjects across the adult lifespan to understand the behavioral, computational, and neural bases of payoff maximization versus melioration. The observed reward choice behavior on this task was best explained by a reinforcement learning model of differential future reward prediction. Simultaneously recorded and source-localized electroencephalography (EEG) showed that diminished theta-band activations in the right rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) correspond to greater reward payoff maximization, specifically during the presentation of cumulative reward information at the end of each task trial. Notably, these activations (greater rACC theta) predicted depressed mood symptoms, thereby showcasing a reward processing marker of potential clinical utility.\n\nSignificance StatementThis study presents cognitive, computational and neural (EEG-based) analyses of a rapid reward-based decision-making task. The research has the following three highlights. 1) It teases apart two core aspects of reward processing, i.e. long term expected value maximization versus immediate gain frequency melioration based choice behavior. 2) It models reinforcement learning based behavioral differences between individuals showing that observed performance is best explained by differential extents of reward prediction. 3) It investigates neural correlates in 186 healthy human subjects across the adult lifespan, revealing specific theta band cortical source activations in right rostral anterior cingulate as correlates for maximization that further predict depressed mood across subjects.",

    "abstract": "The aggregation of tau proteins into insoluble filaments and the spread of these filaments across brain regions are the major drivers of neurodegeneration in tauopathies, including in Alzheimers disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a crucial genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, has been shown to exacerbate tau pathology in mouse models. However, the exact mechanisms through which APOE4 induces tau pathology remains unknown. Here, we report that the astrocyte-secreted protein glypican-4 (GPC-4), which we identify as a novel binding partner of APOE4, drives tau pathology. We discovered that GPC-4 preferentially interacts with APOE4 in comparison to APOE2, considered to be a protective allele to AD, and post-mortem APOE4-carrying AD brains highly express GPC-4 in neurotoxic astrocytes. The astrocyte-secreted GPC-4 induced both tau accumulation and propagation in vitro. CRISPR/dCas9 mediated activation of GPC-4 in a tauopathy mouse model robustly induced tau pathology. Using in vitro Tau FRET-biosensor cells, human iPSCs-derived astrocytes and an in vivo mouse model, we found that APOE4-induced tau pathology was greatly diminished in the absence of GPC-4. We further show that APOE4-mediated surface trafficking of APOE receptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) through GPC-4 can be a gateway to tau spreading. Together, our data comprehensively demonstrate that APOE4-induced tau pathologies are directly mediated by GPC-4.",

Here we show that dorsal CA1 place cells in rats can modulate their firing rate between replay events of two different contexts.

    "abstract": "In the early visual system, suppression occurs between neurons representing different stimulus properties. This includes features such as orientation (cross-orientation suppression), eye-of-origin (interocular suppression) and spatial location (surround suppression), which are thought to involve distinct anatomical pathways. We asked if these separate routes to suppression can be differentiated by their pattern of gain control on the contrast response function measured in human participants using steady-state electroencephalography. Changes in contrast gain shift the contrast response function laterally, whereas changes in response gain scale the function vertically. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to summarise the evidence for each type of gain control. A computational meta-analysis of 16 previous studies found the most evidence for contrast gain effects with overlaid masks, but no clear evidence favouring either response gain or contrast gain for other mask types. We then conducted two new experiments, comparing suppression from four mask types (monocular and dichoptic overlay masks, and aligned and orthogonal surround masks) on responses to sine wave grating patches flickering at 5Hz. At the occipital pole, there was strong evidence for contrast gain effects in all four mask types at the first harmonic frequency (5Hz). Suppression generally became stronger at more lateral electrode sites, but there was little evidence of response gain effects. At the second harmonic frequency (10Hz) suppression was stronger overall, and involved both contrast and response gain effects. Although suppression from different mask types involves distinct anatomical pathways, gain control processes appear to serve a common purpose, which we suggest might be to suppress less reliable inputs.",

Here, we present LRcell, a computational method aiming to identify specific sub-cell type(s) that drives the changes observed in a bulk RNA-seq experiment. In addition, LRcell provides pre-embedded marker genes computed from putative single-cell RNA-seq experiments as options to execute the analyses. Using three different real datasets, we show that LRcell successfully identifies known cell types involved in psychiatric disorders and LRcell is more sensitive than even the leading deconvolution methods.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in spatially resolved transcriptomics have enabled comprehensive measurements of gene expression patterns while retaining the spatial context of the tissue microenvironment. Deciphering the spatial context of spots in a tissue needs to use their spatial information carefully. To this end, we developed a graph attention auto-encoder framework STAGATE to accurately identify spatial domains by learning low-dimensional latent embeddings via integrating spatial information and gene expression profiles. To better characterize the spatial similarity at the boundary of spatial domains, STAGATE adopts an attention mechanism to adaptively learn the similarity of neighboring spots, and an optional cell type-aware module through integrating the pre-clustering of gene expressions. We validated STAGATE on diverse spatial transcriptomics datasets generated by different platforms with different spatial resolutions. STAGATE could substantially improve the identification accuracy of spatial domains, and denoise the data while preserving spatial expression patterns. Importantly, STAGATE could be extended to multiple consecutive sections to reduce batch effects between sections and extracting three-dimensional (3D) expression domains from the reconstructed 3D tissue effectively.",

    "abstract": "The innate immune receptor RIG-I provides the first line of defense against viral infections. Viral RNAs are recognized by the C-terminal domain (CTD) of RIG-I, but the RNA must engage the helicase domain to release the signaling domain CARDs from their autoinhibitory CARD2:Hel2i interactions. Because the helicase lacks RNA specificity, there must be mechanisms to proofread RNAs entering the helicase domain. Although such mechanisms are crucial in preventing aberrant immune responses by non-specific RNAs, they remain largely unknown. This study reveals a previously unknown proofreading mechanism that RIG-I uses to ensure the helicase engages RNAs chosen explicitly by the CTD. A crucial part of this mechanism involves the intrinsically disordered CARDs-Helicase Linker (CHL), which uses its negatively charged regions to electrostatically antagonize incoming RNAs. In addition to RNA gating, CHL is essential in stabilizing the CARD2:Hel2i interface. The CHL and CARD2:Hel2i interface work together, establishing a tunable gating mechanism that allows CTD-chosen RNAs to bind into the helicase while blocking non-specific RNAs. With its critical regulatory functions, CHL represents a novel target for RIG-I-based therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCD1 transports CoA esters of saturated/monounsaturated very long chain fatty acid from cytosol to the peroxisome for {beta}-oxidation. Dysfunction of human ABCD1 usually causes the severe progressive genetic disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which eventually affects the adrenal glands and/or the central nervous system. Here, we report three cryo-EM structures of human ABCD1 in various states. The apo-form ABCD1 at 3.53 [A] resolution adopts an inward-facing conformation, harboring a phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) molecule at each lateral entry of substrate cavity. In the substrate-bound ABCD1 structure at 3.59 [A] resolution, two molecules of C22:0-CoA (one of the physiological substrates of ABCD1) is symmetrically bound to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Each C22:0-CoA adopts an unpresented L-shape configuration: the CoA portion inserts into a polar pocket at the TMD at a pose parallel to the membrane plane, whereas the acyl chain portion perpendicular to membrane plane is embedded in a hydrophobic pocket at the opposite TMD. Upon binding the two C22:0-CoA molecules, which resemble a pair of hinges crossing the two TMDs, the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of ABCD1 approach towards each other. Addition ATP to the substrate-bound ABCD1 enabled us to reveal an ATP-bound structure at 2.79 [A], which shows an outward-facing conformation with the dimerized NBDs succeeding substrate release. These three structures combined with biochemical assays exhibit a snapshot of ABCD1-mediated substrate recognition, translocation and release. These findings provide the structural insights into the transport mechanism of ABC transporters that transport amphipathic molecules with long acyl chains.",

    "abstract": "Termites are major decomposers of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems and the second most diverse lineage of social insects. The Kalotermitidae, the second-largest termite family, are widely distributed across tropical and subtropical ecosystems, where they typically live in small colonies confined to single wood items inhabited by individuals with no foraging abilities. How the Kalotermitidae have acquired their global distribution patterns remains unresolved. Similarly, it is unclear whether foraging is ancestral to Kalotermitidae or was secondarily acquired in a few species. These questions can be addressed in a phylogenetic framework. We inferred time-calibrated phylogenetic trees of Kalotermitidae using mitochondrial genomes and nuclear ribosomal RNA genes of [~]120 species, about 27% of kalotermitid diversity, including representatives of 22 of the 23 kalotermitid genera. We found that extant kalotermitids shared a common ancestor 81 Mya (72-91 Mya 95% HPD), indicating that a few disjunctions among early-diverging kalotermitid lineages may predate Gondwana breakup. However, most of the [~]40 disjunctions among biogeographic realms were dated at less than 50 Mya, indicating that transoceanic dispersals, and more recently human-mediated dispersals, have been the major drivers of the global distribution of Kalotermitidae. Our phylogeny also revealed that the capacity to forage is often found in early-diverging kalotermitid lineages, implying that the ancestors of Kalotermitidae were able to forage among multiple wood pieces. Our phylogenetic estimates provide a platform for a critical taxonomic revision of the family and for future comparative analyses of Kalotermitidae.",

    "abstract": "Homology of highly divergent genes often cannot be determined from sequence similarity alone. For example, we recently identified in Hormaphis cornu a family of rapidly evolving bicycle genes, which encode novel proteins implicated as plant gall effectors. Sequence similarity search methods yielded few putative bicycle homologs in other species. Coding sequence-independent features of genes, such as intron-exon boundaries, often evolve more slowly than coding sequences, however, and can provide complementary evidence for homology. We found that a linear logistic regression classifier using only structural features of bicycle genes identified many putative bicycle homologs in other species. Independent evidence from sequence features and intron locations supported homology assignments. To test the potential roles of bicycle genes in other aphids, we sequenced the genome of a second gall- forming aphid, Tetraneura ulmi, and found that many bicycle genes are strongly expressed in the salivary glands of the gall forming foundress. In addition, bicycle genes are strongly overexpressed in the salivary glands of a non-gall forming aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, and in the non-gall forming generations of Hormaphis cornu. These observations suggest that Bicycle proteins may be used by multiple aphid species to manipulate plants in diverse ways. Incorporation of gene structural features into sequence search algorithms may aid identification of deeply divergent homologs, especially of rapidly evolving genes involved in host-parasite interactions.",

However, the role of nitrative stress in the pathogenesis of obliterative vascular remolding and severe PAH remains largely unclear. Our recent studies identified a novel mouse model (Egln1Tie2Cre, Egln1 encoding prolyl hydroxylase 2 [PHD2]) with obliterative vascular remodeling and right heart failure, which provides us an excellent model to study the role of nitrative stress in obliterative vascular remodeling. Here we show that nitrative stress was markedly elevated whereas endothelial Caveolin-1 (Cav1) expression was suppressed in the lungs of Egln1Tie2Cre mice. Treatment with a superoxide dismutase mimetic, manganese (III) tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridyl) porphyrin pentachloride (MnTmPyP, also known as a peroxynitrite scavenger) treatment inhibited obliterative pulmonary vascular remodeling and attenuated severe PAH in Egln1Tie2Cre mice. Genetic restoration of endothelial Cav1 expression in Egln1Tie2Cre mice normalized nitrative stress, reduced PAH and improved right heart function. These data suggest that suppression of endothelial Cav1 expression secondary to PHD2 deficiency augments nitrative stress, which contributes to obliterative vascular remodeling and severe PAH. Thus, reactive oxygen/nitrogen species scavenger might have great therapeutic potential for the inhibition of obliterative vascular remodeling and severe PAH.",

    "abstract": "An animal entering a new environment typically faces three challenges: explore the space for resources, memorize their locations, and navigate towards those targets as needed. Experimental work on exploration, mapping, and navigation has mostly focused on simple environments - such as an open arena [68], a pond [42], or a desert [44] - and much has been learned about neural signals in diverse brain areas under these conditions [12, 54]. However, many natural environments are highly structured, such as a system of burrows, or of intersecting paths through the underbrush. Similarly, for many cognitive tasks, a sequence of simple actions can give rise to complex solutions. Here we propose an algorithm that learns the structure of a complex environment, discovers useful targets during exploration, and navigates back to those targets by the shortest path. It makes use of a behavioral module common to all motile animals, namely the ability to follow an odor to its source [4]. We show how the brain can learn to generate internal \"virtual odors\" that guide the animal to any location of interest. This endotaxis algorithm can be implemented with a simple 3-layer neural circuit using only biologically realistic structures and learning rules. Several neural components of this scheme are found in brains from insects to humans. Nature may have evolved a general mechanism for search and navigation on the ancient backbone of chemotaxis.",

    "abstract": "It is widely accepted that there is an inextricable link between neural computations, biological mechanisms, and behavior, but it is challenging to simultaneously relate all three. Here, we show that topological data analysis (TDA) provides an important bridge between these approaches to studying how brains mediate behavior. We demonstrate that cognitive processes change the topological description of the shared activity of populations of visual neurons. These topological changes constrain and distinguish between competing mechanistic models, are connected to subjects performance on a visual change detection task, and, via a link with network control theory, reveal a tradeoff between improving sensitivity to subtle visual stimulus changes and increasing the chance that the subject will stray off task. These connections provide a blueprint for using TDA to uncover the biological and computational mechanisms by which cognition affects behavior in health and disease.\n\nSignificance StatementAs the fields of systems, computational, and cognitive neuroscience strive to establish links between computations, biology, and behavior, there is an increasing need for an analysis framework to bridge levels of analysis. We demonstrate that topological data analysis (TDA) of the shared activity of populations of neurons provides that link. TDA allows us to distinguish between competing mechanistic models and to answer longstanding questions in cognitive neuroscience, such as why there is a tradeoff between visual sensitivity and staying on task. These results and analysis framework have applications to many systems within neuroscience and beyond.",

These assemblages of primarily viruses, bacteria, and fungi stimulate the immune system during development, synthesize important chemical compounds like hormones, aid in digestion, competitively exclude pathogens, etc. The bacteriophages in animal microbiomes are harder to characterize than the bacterial or fungal components of the microbiome and thus we know comparatively little about the temporal and spatial dynamics of bacteriophage communities in animal digestive systems. Recently, the bacteriophages of the honeybee gut were characterized in two European bee populations. Most of the bacteriophages described in these two reports were novel, encoded many metabolic genes in their genomes, and had a community structure that suggests coevolution with their bacterial hosts. To describe the conservation of bacteriophages in bees and begin to understand their role in the bee microbiome, we sequenced the virome of Apis mellifera from Austin, Texas and compared bacteriophage composition between three locations around the world. We found that the majority of bacteriophages from Austin are novel, sharing no sequence similarity to anything in public repositories. However, many bacteriophages are shared among the three bee viromes, indicating specialization of bacteriophages in the bee gut. Our study along with the two previous bee virome studies shows that the bee gut bacteriophage community is simple compared to that of many animals, consisting of several hundred types of bacteriophages that primarily infect four of the dominant bacterial phylotypes in the bee gut.",

    "abstract": "The thermotolerance-plasticity trade-off hypothesis predicts that ectotherms with greater basal thermal tolerance have a lower acclimation capacity. This hypothesis has been tested at both high and low temperatures but the results often conflict. If basal tolerance constrains plasticity (e.g. through shared mechanisms that create physiological constraints), it should be evident at the level of the individual, provided the trait measured is repeatable. Here, we used chill-coma onset temperature and chill-coma recovery time (CCO and CCRT; non-lethal thermal limits) to quantify cold tolerance of Drosophila melanogaster across two trials (pre- and post-acclimation). Cold acclimation improved cold tolerance, as expected, but individual measurements of CCO and CCRT in non-acclimated flies were not (or only slightly) repeatable. Surprisingly, however, there was still a strong correlation between basal tolerance and plasticity in cold-acclimated flies. We argue that this relationship is a statistical artefact (specifically, a manifestation of regression to the mean; RTM) and does not reflect a true trade-off or physiological constraint. Thermal tolerance trade-off patterns in previous studies that used similar methodology are thus likely to be impacted by RTM. Moving forward, controlling and/or correcting for RTM effects is critical to determining whether such a trade-off or physiological constraint truly exists.",

In doing so, it helps to maintain proteostasis in mitochondria. How ATAD1 tackles the energetic challenge to extract hydrophobic membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and what structural features adapt ATAD1 for its particular function has remained a mystery. Previously, we determined the structure of Msp1 in complex with a peptide substrate (Wang et al., 2020). The structure showed that Msp1s mechanism follows the general principle established for AAA proteins while adopting several structural features that specialize it for its function. We used the yeast growth assay to test the function of key amino acids within these structural elements. In this work, we determined the cryo-EM structures of the human ATAD1 in complex with a peptide substrate at near atomic resolution. The structures show that phylogenetically conserved structural elements adapt ATAD1 for its function while generally adopting a conserved mechanism shared by many AAA proteins. ATAD1s distinguishing features include an abundance of aromatic amino acids that line the central pore proposed to give ATAD1 a firm grip on its substrate and a short -helix at the C-terminus that strongly facilitates ATAD1s oligomerization. We also developed a microscopy-based assay reporting on protein mislocalization, with which we directly assessed ATAD1s activity in live cells.",

Thus, a better understand of the normal mammary gland development can reveal possible mechanism in how normal cells are re-programmed to become malignant cells. E2F1-4 are part of the E2F transcription factor family with varied roles in mammary development. However, little is known about the role of E2F5 in mammary gland development. A combination of scRNAseq and predictive signature tools demonstrate the presence of E2F5 in the mammary gland and showed altered activity during the various phases of mammary gland development and function. Testing the hypothesis that E2F5 regulates mammary function, we generated a mammary-specific E2F5 knockout mouse model, resulting in modest mammary gland development changes. However, after a prolonged latency the E2F5 conditional knockout mice developed highly metastatic mammary tumors with metastases in both the lung and liver. Transplantation of the tumors revealed metastases to lymph nodes that was enriched through serial transplantation. Through whole genome sequencing and RNAseq analysis we identified, and then confirmed in vivo, that Cyclin D1 was dysregulated in E2F5 conditional knockout mammary glands and tumors. Based on these findings, we propose that loss of E2F5 leads altered regulation of Cyclin D1, which facilitates the development of mammary tumors.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer treatment has benefited greatly from the development of effective immune-based therapies. However, these strategies still fail in a large subset of patients. Tumor-intrinsic mutations can drive immune evasion via recruiting immunosuppressive populations or suppressing anti-tumor immune responses. KEAP1 is one of the most frequently mutated genes in lung adenocarcinoma patients and is associated with poor prognosis and inferior response to all therapies, including checkpoint blockade. Here, we established a novel antigenic lung cancer model and showed that Keap1-mutant tumors promote dramatic remodeling of the tumor immune microenvironment. Combining single-cell technology and depletion studies, we demonstrate that Keap1-mutant tumors diminish dendritic cell and T cell responses driving immunotherapy resistance. Importantly, analysis of KEAP1 mutant patient tumors revealed analogous decrease in dendritic cell and T cell infiltration. Our study provides new insight into the role of KEAP1 mutations in promoting immune evasion and suggests a path to novel immune-based therapeutic strategies for KEAP1 mutant lung cancer.\n\nStatement of significanceThis study establishes that tumor-intrinsic KEAP1 mutations contribute to immune evasion through suppression of dendritic cell and T cell responses, explaining the observed resistance to immunotherapy of KEAP1 mutant tumors. These results highlight the importance of stratifying patients based on KEAP1 status and paves the way for novel therapeutic strategies.",

    "abstract": "Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) controls a plethora of developmental processes. Thus, regulation of their levels is of great relevance for plant performance. Cellular IAA concentration depends on the combined result of its transport, biosynthesis and various redundant pathways to inactivate IAA, including oxidation and conjugation. Group II members of the GRETCHEN HAGEN 3 (GH3) gene family code for acyl acid amido synthetases catalysing the conjugation of IAA to amino acids. However, the high level of functional redundancy among them has hampered thorough analysis of their roles in plant development. In this work, we generated an Arabidopsis gh3.1,2,3,4,5,6,9,17 (gh3oct) mutant to knock-out the group II GH3 pathway. The gh3oct plants had an improved root architecture, were more tolerant to osmotic stresses due to locally increased IAA levels and were more drought tolerant. IAA metabolite quantification in gh3oct plants suggested the existence of additional GH3-like enzymes in IAA metabolism. Moreover, our data suggested that oxIAA production depends, at least partly, on the GH3 pathway. Targeted stress-hormone analysis further suggested an involvement of ABA in the differential response to salinity of gh3oct plants. Taken together, our data provide new insights into the roles of group II GH3s in IAA metabolism and hormone-regulated plant development.",

Among the various cells participating in BBB and NVU function, spontaneous Ca2+ signals in astrocytic endfeet are crucial for maintaining BBB and NVU integrity. To assess if aging is associated with changes in spontaneous Ca2+ signals within astrocytic endfeet of the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), we expressed a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator, Lck-GCaMP6f in DLS astrocytes of young (3-4 month) and aging (20-24 month) mice. Compared to young mice, endfeet in the DLS of aging mice demonstrated a decrease in calreticulin (CALR) expression, and dramatic alterations in the dynamics of endfoot membrane-associated and mitochondrial Ca2+ signals. While young mice required both extracellular and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ sources for generating endfoot Ca2+ signals, aging mice showed exclusive dependence on ER Ca2+. These data suggest that aging is associated with significant changes in Ca2+ buffers and Ca2+ signals within astrocytic endfeet, which has important implications for understanding mechanisms involved in aging-related impairment of the BBB and NVU.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/461710v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (30K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d61571org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19e2f9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@18455cborg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11ca928_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HighlightsO_LIAging mice show reduced calreticulin expression in astrocytic endfeet\nC_LIO_LIAging astrocytic endfeet show dramatic changes in spontaneous Ca2+ activity\nC_LIO_LICa2+ signals in aging endfeet depend exclusively on endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cohesin organizes the genome by forming intra-chromosomal loops and inter-sister chromatid linkages. During gamete formation by meiosis, chromosomes are reshaped to support crossover recombination and two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation. Here we show that Eco1 acetyltransferase positions both chromatin loops and sister chromatid cohesion to organize meiotic chromosomes into functional domains in budding yeast. Eco1 acetylates the Smc3 cohesin subunit in meiotic S phase to establish chromatin boundaries, independently of DNA replication. Boundary formation by Eco1 is critical for prophase exit and for the maintenance of cohesion until meiosis II, but is independent of the ability of Eco1 to antagonize the cohesin-release factor, Wpl1. Conversely, prevention of cohesin release by Wpl1 is essential for centromeric cohesion, kinetochore monoorientation and co-segregation of sister chromatids in meiosis I. Our findings establish Eco1 as a key determinant of chromatin boundaries and cohesion positioning, revealing how local chromosome structuring directs genome transmission into gametes.",

After decades of research, the transmembrane-like channel 1 and 2 (TMC1 and TMC2) have been recently identified as pore-forming subunits of the MET channels, but the molecular peculiarity that differentiates these two proteins and makes TMC1 essential for hearing remains elusive. Here, we show that TMC1, but not TMC2, is essential for membrane remodeling triggered by a decrease in intracellular calcium concentration. We demonstrate that inhibition of MET channels or buffering of intracellular calcium lead to pronounced phosphatidylserine externalization, membrane blebbing and ectosome release at the hair cell sensory organelle, culminating in the loss of TMC1 protein. Moreover, three TMC1 deafness-causing mutations cause constitutive phosphatidylserine externalization that correlates with the deafness phenotype, suggesting that the mechanisms of hearing loss involve alterations in membrane homeostasis.",

GW182, 4E-T and DDX6 essential for PB formation differentially affect SG formation in the cells under ARS stress, with DDX6 being the most prominent. The cells with DDX6 deficiency display irregular shape of SG which could be rescued by ectopic wt DDX6, but not its helicase mutant E247A DDX6, which induces SG in the cells without stress, indicating that DDX6 helicase activity is essential for PB, but suppressive for SG.

    "abstract": "Adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) is responsible for the transport of free very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and corresponding CoA-esters across the peroxisomal membrane. ALDP belongs to the ATP-binding cassette sub-family D, which is also named as ABCD1. Dysfunction of ALDP leads to peroxisomal metabolic disorder exemplified by X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Hundreds of ALD-causing mutations are identified on ALDP. However, the pathogenic mechanisms of these mutations are restricted to clinical description due to limited structural information. Furthermore, ALDP plays a role in myelin maintenance, which is tightly associated with axon regeneration. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of human ALDP with nominal resolution of 3.4 [A] in nucleotide free state. The structure of ALDP exhibits a typical assembly of ABC transporters. The nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) displays a ligand free state. ALDP exhibits an inward-open conformation to the cytosol. A short helix is located at the peroxisomal side, which is different from other three members of ABCD transporters. The two transmembrane domains (TMDs) of ALDP form a cavity, in which two lipid-like densities can be recognized as the head group of an coenzyme-A ester of a lipid. This structure provides a framework for understanding the working mechanism of ALDP and classification of the disease-causing mutations.",

    "abstract": "Diverse heterozygous mutations in the human insulin gene cause a monogenic diabetes mellitus (DM) syndrome due to toxic misfolding of the variant proinsulin. Whereas mutations that add or remove cysteines (thereby leading to an odd number of thiol groups) generally lead to neonatal-onset DM, non-Cys-related mutations can be associated with a broad range of ages of onset. Here, we compare two mutations at a conserved position in the central B-chain -helix: one neonatal in DM onset (ValB18[-&gt;]Gly) and the other with onset delayed until adolescence (AlaB18). The substitutions were introduced within a 49-residue single-chain insulin precursor optimized for folding efficiency (Zaykov, A., et al. ACS Chem. Biol. 9, 683-91 (2014)). Although mutations are each unfavorable, GlyB18 (a) more markedly perturbs DesDi folding efficiency in vitro than does AlaB18 and (b) more severely induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in cell-based studies of the respective proinsulin variants. In corresponding two-chain hormone analogs, GlyB18 more markedly perturbs structure, function and thermodynamic stability than does AlaB18. Indeed, the GlyB18-insulin analog forms a molten globule with attenuated -helix content whereas the AlaA18 analog retains a nativelike cooperative structure with reduced free energy of unfolding ({Delta}{Delta}Gu 1.2({+/-}0.2) kcal/mole relative to ValB18 parent). We propose that mutations at B18 variably impede nascent pairing of CysB19 and CysA20 to an extent correlated with perturbed core packing once native disulfide pairing is achieved. Differences in age of disease onset (neonatal or adolescent) reflect relative biophysical perturbations (severe or mild) of an obligatory on-pathway protein folding intermediate.",

    "abstract": "Despite intensive therapy, children with high-risk neuroblastoma are at risk of treatment failure. We applied a pan-cancer, multi-omic system approach to evaluate metabolic vulnerabilities in human neuroblastoma. By combining metabolomics, CRISPR screen and gene expression data from more than 700 solid tumor cell lines, we identified DHODH, a critical enzyme in pyrimidine synthesis, as a potential novel treatment target in neuroblastoma. Of note, DHODH inhibition is currently under clinical investigation in patients with hematologic malignancies. In neuroblastoma, DHODH expression was identified as an independent risk factor for aggressive disease, and high DHODH levels correlated to worse overall and event-free survival. A subset of high-risk neuroblastoma tumors with the highest DHODH expression was associated with a dismal prognosis, with a 5-year survival of less than 10%. In neuroblastoma cell lines, DHODH gene dependency was found to correlate with MYCN dependency, rendering these cell lines highly sensitive to DHODH inhibition in vitro. In xenograft and transgenic neuroblastoma mouse models, tumor growth was dramatically reduced, and survival extended following treatment with the DHODH inhibitor brequinar. A combination of brequinar and temozolomide cured the majority of transgenic TH-MYCN neuroblastoma mice, indicating a highly active clinical combination therapy with curative potential. Overall, DHODH inhibition combined with temozolomde has clear therapeutic potential in neuroblastoma and we propose this combination as a candidate for clinical testing.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variants of concern (VOCs) continue to wreak havoc across the globe. Higher transmissibility and immunologic resistance of VOCs bring unprecedented challenges to epidemic extinguishment. Here we describe a monoclonal antibody, 2G1, that neutralizes all current VOCs and has surprising tolerance to mutations adjacent to or within its interaction epitope. Cryo-electron microscopy structure showed that 2G1 bound to the tip of receptor binding domain (RBD) of spike protein with small contact interface but strong hydrophobic effect, which resulted in nanomolar to sub-nanomolar affinities to spike proteins. The epitope of 2G1 on RBD partially overlaps with ACE2 interface, which gives 2G1 ability to block interaction between RBD and ACE2. The narrow binding epitope but high affinity bestow outstanding therapeutic efficacy upon 2G1 that neutralized VOCs with sub-nanomolar IC50 in vitro. In SARS-CoV-2 and Beta- and Delta-variant-challenged transgenic mice and rhesus macaque models, 2G1 protected animals from clinical illness and eliminated viral burden, without serious impact to animal safety. Mutagenesis experiments suggest that 2G1 could be potentially capable of dealing with emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in future. This report characterized the therapeutic antibodies specific to the tip of spike against SARS-CoV-2 variants and highlights the potential clinical applications as well as for developing vaccine and cocktail therapy.",

The aim of the current investigation was to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways in COVID-19 infection and its associated complications by bioinformatics analysis, and to provide potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. Valid next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of 93 COVID 19 samples and 100 non COVID 19 samples (GSE156063) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to identify the biological role of DEGs. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to identify the key genes. A total of 738 DEGs were identified, including 415 up regulated genes and 323 down regulated genes. Most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in immune system process, cell communication, immune system and signaling by NTRK1 (TRKA). Through PPI, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network analysis, ESR1, UBD, FYN, STAT1, ISG15, EGR1, ARRB2, UBE2D1, PRKDC and FOS were selected as hub genes, which were expressed in COVID-19 samples relative to those in non COVID-19 samples, respectively.

    "abstract": "Transmembrane protein channels enable fast and highly sensitive electrical detection of single molecules. Nanopore sequencing of DNA was achieved using an engineered Mycobacterium smegmatis porin A (MspA) in combination with a motor enzyme. Due to its favorable channel geometry, the octameric MspA pore exhibits the highest current level as compared to other pore proteins. To date, MspA is the only protein nanopore with a published record of DNA sequencing. While widely used in commercial devices, nanopore sequencing of DNA suffers from significant base-calling errors due to stochastic events of the complex DNA-motor-pore combination and the contribution of up to five nucleotides to the signal at each position. Asymmetric mutations within subunits of the channel protein offer an enormous potential to improve nucleotide resolution and sequencing accuracy. However, random subunit assembly does not allow control of the channel composition of MspA and other oligomeric protein pores. In this study, we showed that it is feasible to convert octameric MspA into a single-chain pore by connecting eight subunits using peptide linkers. We constructed single-chain MspA trimers, pentamers, hexamers and heptamers to demonstrate that it is feasible to alter the subunit stoichiometry and the MspA pore diameter. All single-chain MspA proteins formed functional channels in lipid bilayer experiments. Importantly, we demonstrated that single-chain MspA discriminated all four nucleotides identical to MspA produced from monomers. Thus, single-chain MspA constitutes a new milestone in its development and adaptation as a biosensor for DNA sequencing and many other applications.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNFICANCENanopore sequencing of DNA is a fast and cheap technology that uniquely delivers multi-kilobase reads. It is currently used world-wide in many applications such as genome sequencing, epigenetics, and surveillance of viral and bacterial pathogens and has started to revolutionize human lives in medicine, agriculture and environmental studies. However, the high base-calling error rates prevent nanopore DNA sequencing from reaching its full potential. In this study, we converted octameric MspA into a single-chain pore enabling asymmetric mutations to fine-tune the pore geometry and chemistry and address the shortcomings of nanopores. Thus, single-chain MspA constitutes a new milestone in its development and adaptation as a biosensor for DNA sequencing and many other applications.",

Here we have developed LIGHTHOUSE, a graph-based deep learning approach for discovery of the hidden principles underlying the association of small-molecule compounds with target proteins. Without any 3D structural information for proteins or chemicals, LIGHTHOUSE estimates protein-compound scores that incorporate known evolutionary relations and available experimental data. It identified novel therapeutics for cancer, lifestyle-related disease, and bacterial infection. Moreover, LIGHTHOUSE predicted ethoxzolamide as a therapeutic for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and this agent was indeed effective against alpha, beta, gamma, and delta variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that are rampant worldwide.

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a worldwide health concern, and new treatment strategies are needed 1. Targeting inflammatory innate immunity pathways holds therapeutic promise, but effective molecular targets remain elusive. Here, we show that human caspase-4 (CASP4), and its mouse homologue, caspase-11 (CASP11), are upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infections, and that CASP4 expression correlates with severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. SARS-CoV-2-infected Casp11-/- mice were protected from severe weight loss and lung pathology, including blood vessel damage, compared to wild-type (WT) and gasdermin-D knock out (Gsdmd-/-) mice. GSDMD is a downstream effector of CASP11 and CASP1. Notably, viral titers were similar in the three genotypes. Global transcriptomics of SARS-CoV-2-infected WT, Casp11-/- and Gsdmd-/- lungs identified restrained expression of inflammatory molecules and altered neutrophil gene signatures in Casp11-/- mice. We confirmed that protein levels of inflammatory mediators IL-1{beta}, IL6, and CXCL1, and neutrophil functions, were reduced in Casp11-/- lungs. Additionally, Casp11-/- lungs accumulated less von Willebrand factor, a marker for endothelial damage, but expressed more Kruppel-Like Factor 2, a transcription factor that maintains vascular integrity. Overall, our results demonstrate that CASP4/11, promotes detrimental SARS-CoV-2-associated inflammation and coagulopathy, largely independently of GSDMD, identifying CASP4/11 as a promising drug target for treatment and prevention of severe COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "The interactions between severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human host factors enable the virus to propagate infections that lead to COVID-19. The spike protein is the largest structural component of the virus and mediates interactions essential for infection, including with the primary ACE2 receptor. We performed two independent cell-based systematic screens to determine whether there are additional proteins by which the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 can interact with human cells. We discovered that in addition to ACE2, expression of LRRC15 also causes spike protein binding. This interaction is distinct from other known spike attachment mechanisms such as heparan sulfates or lectin receptors. Measurements of orthologous coronavirus spike proteins implied the interaction was restricted to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting LRRC15 represents a novel class of spike binding interaction. We localized the interaction to the C-terminus of the S1 domain, and showed that LRRC15 shares recognition of the ACE2 receptor binding domain. From analyzing proteomics and single-cell transcriptomics, we identify LRRC15 expression as being common in human lung vasculature cells and fibroblasts. Although infection assays demonstrated that LRRC15 alone is not sufficient to permit viral entry, we present evidence it can modulate infection of human cells. This unexpected interaction merits further investigation to determine how SARS-CoV-2 exploits host LRRC15 and whether it could account for any of the distinctive features of COVID-19.\n\nIn briefWe present evidence from genome-wide screening that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with human cells expressing LRRC15. The interaction is distinct from previously known classes of spike attachment factors, and appears to have emerged recently within the coronavirus family. Although not sufficient for cell invasion, this interaction can modulate viral infection. Our data point to an unappreciated host factor for SARS-CoV-2, with potential relevance to COVID-19.\n\nHighlights- Two systematic cell-based screens for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding identify LRRC15 as a human host factor\n- Interaction with LRRC15 is reproducible in different human cell lines and independent of known glycan or ACE2 binding pathways\n- The C-terminal S1 domain of SARS-CoV-2 spike binds LRRC15 with sub-micromolar affinity, while related coronavirus spikes do not\n- LRRC15 is expressed in tissues with high ACE2 levels and may modulate infection",

    "abstract": "FDA-approved and Emergency Use Authorized (EUA) vaccines using new mRNA and viral-vector technology are highly effective in preventing moderate to severe disease, however, information on their long-term efficacy and protective breadth against SARS-CoV-2 Variants of Concern (VOCs) is currently scarce. Here we describe the durability and broad-spectrum VOC immunity of a prefusion-stabilized spike (S) protein adjuvanted with liquid or lyophilized CoVaccine HT in cynomolgus macaques. This recombinant subunit vaccine is highly immunogenic and induces robust spike-specific and broadly neutralizing antibody responses effective against circulating VOCs (B.1.351 [Beta], P.1 [Gamma], B.1.617 [Delta]) for at least 3 months after the final boost. Protective efficacy and post-exposure immunity were evaluated using a heterologous P.1 challenge nearly 3 months after the last immunization. Our results indicate that while immunization with both high and low S doses shorten and reduce viral loads in the upper and lower respiratory tract, a higher antigen dose is required to provide durable protection against disease as vaccine immunity wanes. Histologically, P.1 infection causes similar COVID-19-like lung pathology as seen with early pandemic isolates. Post-challenge IgG concentrations were restored to peak immunity levels and vaccine-matched and cross-variant neutralizing antibodies were significantly elevated in immunized macaques indicating an efficient anamnestic response. Only low levels of P.1-specific neutralizing antibodies with limited breadth were observed in control (non-vaccinated but challenged) macaques suggesting that natural infection may not prevent reinfection by other VOCs. Overall, these results demonstrate that a properly dosed and adjuvanted recombinant subunit vaccine can provide long-lasting and protective immunity against circulating VOCs.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA recombinant subunit protein formulated with CoVaccine HT adjuvant induces superior immunity than natural infection and reduces viral load while protecting cynomolgus macaques from COVID-19-like disease caused by late SARS-CoV-2 P.1 (Gamma) challenge.",

    "abstract": "Genes are often differentially expressed between males and females. In Drosophila melanogaster, the analysis of sex-biased microRNAs (short non-coding regulatory molecules) has revealed striking differences with protein-coding genes. Mainly, the X chromosome is enriched in male-biased microRNA genes, although it is depleted of male-biased protein-coding genes. The paucity of male-biased genes in the X chromosome is generally explained by an evolutionary process called demasculinization. I suggest that the excess of male-biased microRNAs in the X chromosome is due to high-rates of de novo emergence of microRNAs (mostly in other neighboring microRNAs), a tendency of novel microRNAs in the X chromosome to be expressed in testis, and to a lack of a demasculinization process. To test this hypothesis I analysed the expression profile of microRNAs in males, females and gonads in D. pseudoobscura, in which an autosome translocated into the X chromosome effectively becoming part of a sex chromosome (neo-X). I found that the pattern of sex-biased expression is generally conserved between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Also, orthologous microRNAs in both species conserve their chromosomal location, indicating that there is no evidence of demasculinization or other inter-chromosomal movement of microRNAs. D. pseudoobscuraspecific microRNAs in the neo-X chromosome tend to be male-biased and particularly expressed in testis. In summary, the apparent paradox resulting from male-biased protein-coding genes depleted in the X chromosome and an enrichment in male-biased microRNAs is consistent with different evolutionary dynamics between coding genes and short RNAs.",

We analysed RNA-sequence data from 28 sea lamprey gonads sampled across life-history stages, generated a genome-guided de novo superTransciptome with annotations, and identified genes in the GSR. We found that the 638 genes in the GSR are enriched for reproductive processes, exhibit 36x greater odds of being expressed in testes than ovaries, show little evidence of conserved synteny with other chordates, and most have putative paralogues in the GSR and/or somatic genomes. Further, several of these genes play known roles in sex determination and differentiation in other vertebrates.

Comprising three known species, seadragons are widely recognized and admired for their fantastical body forms and coloration, and their specific habitat requirements have made them flagship representatives for marine conservation and natural history interests. Until recently, a gap has been the lack of significant genomic resources for seadragons. We have produced gene-annotated, chromosome-scale genome models for the leafy and weedy seadragon to advance investigations into evolutionary innovation and elaboration of morphological traits in seadragons as well as their pipefish and seahorse relatives. We identified several interesting features specific to seadragon genomes, including divergent non-coding regions near a developmental gene important for integumentary outgrowth, a high genome-wide density of repetitive DNA, and recent expansions of transposable elements and a vesicular trafficking gene family. Surprisingly, comparative analyses leveraging the seadragon genomes and additional syngnathid and outgroup genomes revealed striking, syngnathid-specific losses in the family of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), which likely involve re-organization of highly conserved gene regulatory networks in ways that have not previously been documented in natural populations. The resources presented here serve as important tools for future evolutionary studies of developmental processes in syngnathids and will be a key resource for conservation studies of the extravagant seadragons and their relatives.",

Although some pharmacological agents are known to alter social behavior, precise description and quantification of such effects have proven difficult. The complexity of brain functions regulating sociality makes it challenging to predict drug effects on social behavior without testing in live animals, and most existing behavioral assays are low-throughput and provide only unidimensional readouts of social function. To achieve richer characterization of drug effects on sociality, we developed a scalable social behavioral assay for zebrafish named ZeChat based on unsupervised deep learning. High-dimensional and dynamic social behavioral phenotypes are automatically classified using this method. By screening a neuroactive compound library, we found that different classes of chemicals evoke distinct patterns of social behavioral fingerprints. By examining these patterns, we discovered that dopamine D3 agonists possess a social stimulative effect on zebrafish. The D3 agonists pramipexole, piribedil, and 7-hydroxy-DPAT-HBr rescued social deficits in a valproic acid-induced zebrafish autism model. The ZeChat platform provides a promising approach for dissecting the pharmacology of social behavior and discovering novel social-modulatory compounds.",

To investigate the relationship between phages and microbial communities, the identification of phages from metagenome sequences is the first step. Currently, there are two main methods for identifying phages: database-based (alignment-based) methods and alignment-free methods. Database-based methods typically use a large number of sequences as references; alignment-free methods usually learn the features of the sequences with machine learning and deep learning models.\n\nResultsWe propose INHERIT which uses a deep representation learning model to integrate both database-based and alignment-free methods, combining the strengths of both. Pre-training is used as an alternative way of acquiring knowledge representations from existing databases, while the BERT-style deep learning framework retains the advantage of alignment-free methods. We compare INHERIT with four existing methods on a third-party benchmark dataset. Our experiments show that INHERIT achieves a better performance with the F1-score of 0.9932. In addition, we find that pre-training two species separately helps the non-alignment deep learning model make more accurate predictions.\n\nAvailabilityThe codes of INHERIT are now available in: https://github.com/Celestial-Bai/INHERIT.\n\nContactyaozhong@ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp and imoto@hgc.jp\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at BioRxiv online.",

In spite of recent progress, low-level knowledge of bacteria driving microbial interactions within microbiomes remains unknown, limiting our ability to fully understand and control microbial communities. In this study, we present a novel approach for identifying driver species within microbiomes. Bakdrive infers ecological networks of given metagenomic sequencing samples and identifies minimum sets of driver species using control theory. Bakdrive has three key innovations in this space: (i) it leverages inherent information from metagenomic sequencing samples to identify driver species, (ii) it explicitly takes host-specific variation into consideration, and (iii) it does not require a known ecological network. In extensive simulated data, we demonstrate identifying driver species identified from healthy donor samples and introducing them to the disease samples, we can restore the gut microbiome in recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection patients to a healthy state. We also applied Bakdrive to two real datasets, rCDI and Crohns disease patients, uncovering driver species consistent with previous work. In summary, Bakdrive provides a novel approach for teasing apart microbial interactions. Bakdrive is open-source and available at https://gitlab.com/treangenlab/bakdrive",

    "abstract": "Many pathogenic missense mutations are found in protein positions that are neither well-conserved nor belong to any known functional domains. Consequently, we lack any mechanistic underpinning of dysfunction caused by such mutations. We explored the disruption of allosteric dynamic coupling between these positions and the known functional sites as a possible mechanism for such mutations. In this study, we present an analysis of 144 human enzymes containing 591 pathogenic missense variants, in which allosteric dynamic coupling of mutated positions with known active sites provides insights into a primary biophysical mechanism and evidence of their functional importance. We illustrate this mechanism in a case study of {beta}-Glucocerebrosidase (GCase), which contains 94 Gaucher disease-associated missense variants located some distance away from the active site. An analysis of the conformational dynamics of GCase suggests that mutations on these distal sites cause changes in the flexibility of active site residues despite their distance, indicating a dynamic communication network throughout the protein. The disruption of the long-distance dynamic coupling due to the presence of missense mutations may provide a plausible general mechanistic explanation for biological dysfunction and disease.\n\nAuthor SummaryGenetic diseases occur when mutations to a particular gene cause a gain/loss in function of the related protein. Although several methods based on conservation and protein biochemistry exist to predict which genetic mutations may impact function, many disease causing changes remain unexplained by these metrics. In this study, we propose an explanation for these genetic changes may cause disease. In order to function, important regions of a protein must be able to exhibit collective motion. Through computer simulations, we observed that changing even a single amino acid within a protein can change the protein motion. Notably, disease causing genetic changes tend to alter the motion of regions which are critically important to protein function, even the mutations are far from these critical regions. In addition, we examined the degree that two amino acids within a protein may \"couple\" to one another, meaning the degree to which motion in one amino acid will affect the other. We found that amino acids which are highly coupled to the active site of a protein are more likely to result in disease if mutated, thereby offering a new tool for predicting genetic disease which incorporates internal protein dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Myocyte disarray is a hallmark of many cardiac disorders. However, the relationship between alterations in the orientation of individual myofibrils and myofilaments to disease progression has been largely underexplored. This oversight has predominantly been due to a paucity of methods for objective and quantitative analysis. Here we introduce a novel, less-biased approach to quantify myofibrillar and myofilament orientation in cardiac muscle under near physiological conditions and demonstrate its superiority as compared to conventional histological assessments. Using small-angle X-ray diffraction, we first investigated changes in myofibrillar orientation at increasing sarcomere lengths in permeabilized, relaxed, wildtype mouse myocardium by assessing the angular spread of the 1,0 equatorial reflection (angle {sigma}). At a sarcomere length (SL) of 1.9 m, the angle {sigma} was 0.23{+/-}0.01 rad, decreased to 0.19{+/-}0.01 rad at a SL of 2.1 m, and further decreased to 0.15{+/-}0.01 rad at a SL of 2.3 m (p<0.0001). Angle {sigma} was significantly larger in R403Q, a MYH7 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) model, porcine myocardium (0.24{+/-}0.01 rad) compared to WT myocardium (0.14{+/-}0.005 rad, p<0.0001) as well as in human heart failure tissue (0.19{+/-}0.006 rad) when compared to non-failing samples (0.17{+/-}0.007 rad, p=0.01). These data indicate that diseased myocardium suffers from greater myofibrillar disorientation compared to healthy controls. Finally, we showed that conventional, histology-based analysis of disarray can be subject to user bias and/or sampling error and lead to false positives. Our method for directly assessing myofibrillar orientation avoids the artifacts introduced by conventional histological approaches that assess myocyte orientation and only indirectly evaluate myofibrillar orientation, and provides a precise and objective metric for phenotypically characterizing myocardium. The ability to obtain excellent X-ray diffraction patterns from frozen human myocardium provides a new tool for investigating structural anomalies associated with cardiac diseases.\n\nStatement of SignificanceWe introduce a precise and quantitative approach to directly measure myofibrillar and myofilament orientation in cardiac muscle under near physiological conditions as a novel tool for phenotypically characterizing striated muscle systems. We use this technique to demonstrate that myocardium from disease model organisms and failing human myocardium suffers from greater myofibrillar disorientation compared to healthy controls. We also demonstrate that excellent diffraction patterns can be obtained from frozen and thawed human myocardium. Given the ready availability of frozen human heart tissue in tissue banks, this capability opens up a large space of potential experiments relating sarcomere structure to dysfunction in cardiac disorders.",

    "abstract": "Low grade gliomas (LGG) account for about two-thirds of all glioma diagnoses in adolescents and young adults (AYA) and malignant progression of these patients leads to dismal outcomes. Recent studies have shown the importance of the dynamic tumor microenvironment in high-grade gliomas (HGG), yet its role is still poorly understood in low-grade glioma malignant progression. Here, we investigated the heterogeneity of the immune microenvironment using a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-driven RCAS (replication-competent ASLV long terminal repeat with a splice acceptor) glioma model that recapitulates the malignant progression of low to high-grade glioma in humans and also provides a model system to characterize immune cell trafficking and evolution. To illuminate changes in the immune cell landscape during tumor progression, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on immune cells isolated from animals bearing no tumor (NT), LGG and HGG, with a particular focus on the myeloid cell compartment, which is known to mediate glioma immunosuppression. LGGs demonstrated significantly increased infiltrating T cells, CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, B cells, and natural killer cells in the tumor microenvironment, whereas HGGs significantly abrogated this infiltration. Our study identified two distinct macrophage clusters in the tumor microenvironment; one cluster appeared to be bone marrow-derived while another was defined by overexpression of Trem2, a marker of tumor associated macrophages. Our data demonstrates that these two distinct macrophage clusters show an immune-activated phenotype (Stat1, Tnf, Cxcl9 and Cxcl10) in LGG which evolves to an immunosuppressive state (Lgals3, Apoc1 and Id2) in HGG that restricts T cell recruitment and activation. We identified CD74 and macrophage migration inhibition factor (MIF) as potential targets for these distinct macrophage populations. Interestingly, these results were mirrored by our analysis of the TCGA dataset, which demonstrated a statistically significant association between CD74 overexpression and decreased overall survival in AYA patients with grade II gliomas. Targeting immunosuppressive myeloid cells and intra-tumoral macrophages within this therapeutic window may ameliorate mechanisms associated with immunosuppression before and during malignant progression.",

    "abstract": "Pathogenic mutations in the BRCA2 tumor suppressor gene predispose to breast, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and other cancers. BRCA2 maintains genome stability through homology-directed repair (HDR) of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) and replication fork protection. Nonsense or frameshift mutations leading to truncation of the BRCA2 protein are typically considered pathogenic, however, missense mutations resulting in single amino acid substitutions can be challenging to functionally interpret. The majority of missense mutations in BRCA2 have been classified as Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) with unknown functional consequences. In this study, we identified three BRCA2 VUS located within the BRC repeat region to determine their impact on canonical HDR and fork protection functions. We provide evidence that S1221P and T1980I, which map to conserved residues in the BRC2 and BRC7 repeats, compromise the cellular response to chemotherapeutics and ionizing radiation, and display deficits in fork protection. We further demonstrate biochemically that S1221P and T1980I disrupt RAD51 binding and diminish the ability of BRCA2 to stabilize RAD51-ssDNA complexes. The third variant, T1346I, located within the spacer region between BRC2 and BRC3 repeats, is fully functional. We conclude that T1346I is a benign allele whereas S1221P and T1980I are hypomorphic disrupting the ability of BRCA2 to fully engage and stabilize RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments. Our results underscore the importance of correctly classifying BRCA2 VUS as pathogenic variants can impact both future cancer risk and guide therapy selection during cancer treatment.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=191 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/461749v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (53K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e5e3c6org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cd0e60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16adf4corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a0089_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "O_LIBackground and Aims: Seed mucilage is a common and highly diverse trait shared among thousands of angiosperm species. While long recognized that mucilage allows seeds to anchor to substrates (antitelechory), resisting abiotic and biotic dislodgement, we still lack a mechanistic understanding of this process.\nC_LIO_LIMethods: We propose a mechanistic model of how mucilage affects substrate anchorage and fluid resistance, ultimately contributing to dislodgement resistance. To test this model, we subjected mucilaginous seeds of 52 species, varying in eight measured seed traits, to seven days of continuous water flow at a range of dislodgement potentials.\nC_LIO_LIKey Results: Supporting our model, mucilage mass increased force necessary to dislodge both dry and wet seeds; our measurement of the dislodgement force of dry mucilage explained time to dislodgement well. The effect size was remarkably large; increasing the standardized mucilage mass by one standard deviation resulted in a 280-fold increase in the time to dislodgement. Fluid resistance was largely dependent on speed of water flow and the seeds modified drag coefficient, but not seed traits. Neither mucilage expansion speed nor mucilage decay rate explained dislodgement potential well.\nC_LIO_LIConclusions: Our results suggest that the degree of anchorage to substrate, measured with a simple dislodgement force assay, is highly predictive of mucilaginous seed retention in highly erosive environments. In contrast, we found that other seed and mucilage traits are of lesser importance to anchorage.\nC_LI",

Producing these enzymes often requires large culture volumes, purified nucleases and chromatographic separations to make enzymes of necessary quality. We sought to leverage synthetic biology tools to develop engineered strains allowing for not only the production but rapid purification of these reagents. Toward this goal, we report an E. coli strain enabling the rapid production and purification of Taq polymerase. The method relies on 1) autoinducible expression achieving high protein titers, 2) autolysis and auto DNA/RNA hydrolysis via lysozyme and a mutant benzonase, and 3) heat denaturation under reducing conditions to precipitate contaminating proteins including the mutant benzonase. Taq polymerase is obtained at high purities (>95% pure by SDS-PAGE) and is readily usable in standard reactions. The method takes less than 1 hour of hands-on time, does not require special equipment, expensive reagents or affinity purification.

Wanting assigns value to cues that predict rewards, whereas  needing assigns value to biologically significant stimuli that one is deprived of. Here we aimed at studying how the brain activation patterns related to value of  wanted stimuli differs from that of  needed stimuli using ALE neuroimaging meta-analysis approaches. We used the perception of a cue predicting a reward for  wanting related value and the perception of food stimuli in a hungry state as a model for  needing related value. We carried out separate, contrasts, and conjunction meta-analyses to identify differences and similarities between  wanting and  needing values. Our overall results for  wanting related value show consistent activation of the ventral tegmental area, striatum and pallidum, regions that both activate behaviour and direct choice; while for  needing related value we found an overall consistent activation of the middle insula and to some extent the caudal-ventral putamen, regions that only direct choice. Our study suggests that wanting has more control on consumption, and a needed stimuli must become wanted in order to be pursued.",

    "abstract": "When required, humans can generate very short latency reaches towards visual targets, like catching a falling cellphone. During such rapid reaches, express arm responses are the first wave of upper limb muscle recruitment, occurring ~80-100 ms after target appearance. There is accumulating evidence that express arm responses arise from signaling along the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract, but the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract has not been well-studied. Since the reticulospinal tract projects bilaterally, we studied whether express arm responses would be generated bilaterally. Human participants (n = 14; 7 female) performed visually guided reaches in a modified emerging target paradigm where either arm could intercept the target. We recorded electromyographic activity bilaterally from the pectoralis major muscle. Our analysis focused on target locations where participants reached with the right arm on some trials, and the left arm on others. In support of the involvement of the reticulospinal tract, express arm responses persisted bilaterally regardless of which arm reached to the target. The latency and magnitude of the express arm response did not depend on whether the arm was chosen to reach or not. However, on the reaching arm, the magnitude of the express arm response was correlated to the level of anticipatory activity. The bilateral generation of express arm responses supports the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract. We surmise that the correlation between anticipatory activity and the magnitude of express arm responses on the reaching arm arises from convergence of cortically-derived signals with a parallel subcortical pathway mediating the express arm response.\n\nNew and NoteworthyExpress arm responses have been proposed to arise from the tecto-reticulo-spinal tract originating within the superior colliculus, but the involvement of the reticulo-spinal tract has not been well studied. Here, we show these responses appear bilaterally in a task where either arm can reach to a newly appearing stimulus. Our results suggest that the most rapid visuomotor transformations for reaching are performed by a subcortical pathway.",

    "abstract": "Rett syndrome (RTT) is characterized by dysfunction in neuronal excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance, potentially impacting seizure susceptibility via deficits in K+/Cl- cotransporter 2 (KCC2) function. Mice lacking the Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) recapitulate many symptoms of RTT, and recombinant human insulin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-1) restores KCC2 expression and E/I balance in MeCP2 KO mice. However, clinical trial outcomes of rhIGF-1 in RTT have been variable, and increasing its therapeutic efficacy is highly desirable. To this end, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is promising, as it also critically modulates KCC2 function during early postnatal development. We measured basal KCC2 expression levels in MeCP2 KO mice and identified three key frontal brain regions showing KCC2 alterations in young adult mice but not in postnatal P10 animals. We thus hypothesized that deficits in an IGF-1/OXT signaling crosstalk modulating KCC2 may occur in RTT during postnatal development. Consistently, we detected alterations of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and OXT receptor (OXTR) levels in those brain areas. rhIGF-1 and OXT treatments in KO mice rescued KCC2 expression in a region-specific and complementary manner. These results suggest that region-selective combinatorial pharmacotherapeutic strategies could be the most effective at normalizing E/I balance in key brain regions subtending the RTT pathophysiology.",

    "abstract": "Like all biological and chemical reactions, ion channel kinetics are highly sensitive to changes in temperature. Therefore, it is prudent to investigate channel dynamics at physiological temperatures. However, most ion channel investigations are performed at room temperature due to practical considerations, such as recording stability and technical limitations. This problem is especially severe for the fast voltage-gated sodium channel, whose activation kinetics are faster than the time constant of the standard patch-clamp amplifier at physiological temperatures. Thus, biologically detailed simulations of the action potential generation evenly scale the kinetic models of voltage-gated channels acquired at room temperature. To quantitatively study voltage-gated sodium channels temperature sensitivity, we recorded sodium currents from nucleated patches extracted from the rats layer five neocortical pyramidal neurons at several temperatures from 13.5 to 30oC. We use these recordings to model the kinetics of the voltage-gated sodium channel as a function of temperature. We show that the temperature dependence of activation differs from that of inactivation. Furthermore, we show that the sustained current has a different temperature dependence than the fast current. Our kinetic and thermodynamic analysis of the current provided a numerical model spanning the entire temperature range. This model reproduced vital features of channel activation and inactivation. Furthermore, the model also reproduced action potential dependence on temperature. Thus, we provide an essential building block for the generation of biologically detailed models of cortical neurons.",

    "abstract": "Fluoroquinolones are one of the most widely used class of antibiotics. They target two type II topoisomerase enzymes: gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Resistance to these drugs, which is largely caused by mutations in their target enzymes, is on the rise and becoming a serious public health risk. In this work, we analyze the sequences of 352 extraintestinal E. coli clinical isolates to gain insights into the selective pressures shaping the type II topoisomerase mutation landscape in E. coli. We identify both Quinolone Resistance-Determining Region (QRDR) and non-QRDR mutations, outline their mutation trajectories, and show that they are likely driven by different selective pressures. We confirm that ciprofloxacin resistance is specifically and strongly associated with QRDR mutations. By contrast, non-QRDR mutations are associated with the presence of the chromosomal version of ccdAB, a toxin-antitoxin operon, where the toxin CcdB is known to target gyrase. We also find that ccdAB and the evolution of QRDR mutation trajectories are partially incompatible. Finally, we identify partial deletions in CcdB and additional mutations that likely facilitate the compatibility between the presence of the ccdAB operon and QRDR mutations. These \"permissive\" mutations are all found in ParC (a topoisomerase IV subunit). This, and the fact that CcdB-selected mutations frequently map to topoisomerase IV, strongly suggests that this enzyme (in addition to gyrase) is likely a target for the toxin CcdB in E. coli, although an indirect effect on global supercoiling cannot be excluded. This work opens the door for the use of the presence of ccdB and of the proposed permissive mutations in the genome as genetic markers to assess the risk of quinolone resistance evolution and implies that certain strains may be genetically more refractory to evolving quinolone resistance through mutations in target enzymes.",

    "abstract": "In model-based inference of population structure from individual-level genetic data, individuals are assigned membership coefficients in a series of statistical clusters generated by clustering algorithms. Distinct patterns of variability in membership coefficients can be produced for different groups of individuals, for example, representing different predefined populations, sampling sites, or time periods. Such variability can be difficult to capture in a single numerical value; membership coefficient vectors are multivariate and potentially incommensurable across groups, as the number of clusters over which individuals are distributed can vary among groups of interest. Further, two groups might share few clusters in common, so that membership coefficient vectors are concentrated on different clusters. We introduce a method for measuring the variability of membership coefficients of individuals in a predefined group, making use of an analogy between variability across individuals in membership coefficient vectors and variation across populations in allele frequency vectors. We show that in a model in which membership coefficient vectors in a population follow a Dirichlet distribution, the measure increases linearly with a parameter describing the variance of a specified component of the membership vector. We apply the approach, which makes use of a normalized FST statistic, to data on inferred population structure in three example scenarios. We also introduce a bootstrap test for equivalence of two or more groups in their level of membership coefficient variability. Our methods are implemented in the R package FSTruct.",

    "abstract": "Invasions by fungal plant pathogens pose a significant threat to the health of agriculture ecosystems. Despite limited standing genetic variation, many invasive fungal species can adapt and spread rapidly, resulting in significant losses in crop yields. Here, we report on the population genomics of Colletotrichum truncatum, a polyphagous pathogen that can infect more than 460 plant species, and an invasive pathogen on soybean in Brazil. We study the whole-genome sequences of 18 isolates representing 10 fields from two major regions of soybean production. We show that Brazilian C. truncatum is subdivided into three phylogenetically distinct lineages that exchange genetic variation through hybridization. Introgression affects 2 to 30% of the nucleotides of genomes and varies widely between the lineages. We find that introgressed regions comprise secreted protein-encoding genes, suggesting possible co-evolutionary targets for selection in those regions. We highlight the inherent vulnerability of genetically uniform crops in the agro-ecological environment, particularly when faced with pathogens that can take full advantage of the opportunities offered by an increasingly globalized world. Finally, we discuss \"The Means, Motive, and Opportunity\" of fungal pathogens and how they can become invasive species of crops. We call for more population genomic studies because such analyses can help identify geographic areas and pathogens that pose a risk, thereby helping to inform control strategies to better protect crops in the future.",

    "abstract": "Sweet corn is consistently one of the most highly consumed vegetables in the U.S., providing a valuable opportunity to increase nutrient intake through biofortification. Significant variation for carotenoid (provitamin A, lutein, zeaxanthin) and tocochromanol (vitamin E, antioxidants) levels is present in temperate sweet corn germplasm, yet previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of these traits have been limited by low statistical power and mapping resolution. Here, we employed a high-quality transcriptomic dataset collected from fresh sweet corn kernels to conduct transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) and transcriptome prediction studies for 39 carotenoid and tocochromanol traits. In agreement with previous GWAS findings, TWAS detected significant associations for four causal genes, {beta}-carotene hydroxylase (crtRB1), lycopene epsilon cyclase (lcyE),{gamma} -tocopherol methyltransferase (vte4), and homogentisate geranylgeranyltransferase (hggt1) on a transcriptome-wide level. Pathway-level analysis revealed additional associations for deoxy-xylulose synthase2 (dxs2), diphosphocytidyl methyl erythritol synthase2 (dmes2), cytidine methyl kinase1 (cmk1), and geranylgeranyl hydrogenase1 (ggh1), of which, dmes2, cmk1, and ggh1 have not previously been identified through maize association studies. Evaluation of prediction models incorporating genome-wide markers and transcriptome-wide abundances revealed a trait-dependent benefit to the inclusion of both genomic and transcriptomic data over solely genomic data, but both transcriptome- and genome-wide datasets outperformed a priori candidate gene-targeted prediction models for most traits. Altogether, this study represents an important step towards understanding the role of regulatory variation in the accumulation of vitamins in fresh sweet corn kernels.\n\nCore IdeasO_LITranscriptomic data aid the study of vitamin levels in fresh sweet corn kernels.\nC_LIO_LIcrtRB1, lcyE, dxs2, dmes2, and cmk1 were associated with carotenoid traits.\nC_LIO_LIvte4, hggt1, and ggh1 were associated with tocochromanol traits.\nC_LIO_LITranscriptomic data boosted predictive ability over genomic data alone for some traits.\nC_LIO_LIJoint transcriptome- and genome-wide models achieved the highest predictive abilities.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Denitratation, the selective reduction of nitrate to nitrite, is a novel process when coupled with anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) could achieve resource-efficient biological nitrogen removal of ammonium- and nitrate-laden waste streams. Using a fundamentally-based, first principles approach, this study optimized a stoichiometrically-limited, glycerol-driven denitratation process and characterized mechanisms supporting nitrite accumulation with results that aligned with expectations. Glycerol supported selective nitrate reduction to nitrite and near-complete nitrate conversion, indicating its viability in a denitratation system. Glycerol-supported specific rates of nitrate reduction (135.3 mg-N/g-VSS/h) were at least one order of magnitude greater than specific rates of nitrite reduction (14.9 mg-N/g-VSS/h), potentially resulting in transient nitrite accumulation and indicating glycerols superiority over other organic carbon sources in denitratation systems. pH and ORP inflection points in nitrogen transformation assays corresponded to maximum nitrite accumulation, indicating operational setpoints to prevent further nitrite reduction. Denitratation conditions supported enrichment of Thauera sp. as the dominant genus. Stoichiometric limitation of influent organic carbon, coupled with differential nitrate and nitrite reduction kinetics, optimized operational controls, and a distinctively enriched microbial ecology, was identified as causal in glycerol-driven denitratation.",

    "abstract": "The signalling molecules serve as a fundamental requirement in plants and respond to various internal and external cues. Among several signalling molecules, the significance of gasotransmitters has been realized in several plant developmental and environmental constraints. The hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a novel signalling molecule in higher plants and is involved in several physiological processes right from seed germination to flowering and fruit ripening. Moreover, H2S also assist plants in managing biotic and abiotic stresses, therefore serves as one of the imperative choice of chemical priming. Yet, the metabolism of H2S is not much explored and only appraisal study is made till date from Arabidopsis thaliana. Therefore, the present investigation explored the elucidation of H2S metabolism in crop plant Solanum lycopersicum L. Through in silico investigations the study demonstrated the participation of 29 proteins involved in H2S metabolism, which are mainly localized in cytosol, chloroplast, and mitochondria. Additionally, the relevant protein-protein interactomes were also inferred for sub-cellular compartments and expression data were explored under development and biotic stresses namely PAMPs treatment and bacterial infection. The information generated here will be of high relevance to better target the H2S metabolism to enhance the tomato prospects and also serve a preliminary investigation to be adopted in other agronomic important crops.",

    "abstract": "Benzoxazinoids are plant specialized metabolites with defense properties, highly abundant in wheat (Triticum), one of the worlds most important crops. The goal of our study was to characterize dioxygenase BX6 genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat genotypes and to elucidate their effects on defense against herbivores. Phylogenetic analysis revealed four BX6 genes in the hexaploid wheat T. aestivum, but only one ortholog was found in tetraploid (T. turgidum) wild emmer wheat and the cultivated durum wheat. Transcriptome sequencing of durum wheat plants damaged either by aphids or caterpillars revealed that several BX genes including TtBX6 were upregulated upon caterpillar feeding relative to undamaged control plants. A virus-induced gene silencing approach was used to reduce the expression of BX6 in T. aestivum plants and exhibited both reduced transcript levels and reduced accumulation of different benzoxazinoids. To elucidate the effect of BX6 on plant defense, bioassays with different herbivores feeding on BX6-silenced leaves were conducted. The results showed that plants with silenced BX6 were more susceptible to aphids and the two-spotted spider mite compared to controls. Overall, our study indicates that wheat BX6 is involved in the formation of benzoxazinoids in planta and contributes to plant resistance against insect herbivores.",

    "abstract": "Current treatments for trauma-related disorders remain ineffective for many patients. Here, we modeled interindividual differences in post-therapy fear relapse with a novel ethologically relevant trauma recovery paradigm. After traumatic fear conditioning, male rats underwent fear extinction while foraging in a large enriched arena, permitting the expression of a wide spectrum of behaviors, assessed by an automated pipeline. This multidimensional behavioral assessment revealed that post-conditioning fear response profiles clustered into two groups, respectively characterized by active vs. passive fear responses. After trauma, some animals expressed fear by freezing, while others darted, as if fleeing from danger. Remarkably, belonging to the darters or freezers group predicted differential levels of vulnerability to fear relapse after extinction. Moreover, genome-wide transcriptional profiling revealed that these groups differentially regulated specific sets of genes, some of which have previously been implicated in anxiety and trauma-related disorders. Our results suggest that post-trauma behavioral phenotypes and the associated epigenetic landscapes can serve as markers of fear relapse susceptibility, and thus may be instrumental for future development of more effective treatments for psychiatric patients.",

    "abstract": "The scene-preferring portion of the human ventral visual stream, known as the parahippocampal place area (PPA), responds to scenes and landmark objects, which tend to be large in real-world size, fixed in location, and inanimate. However, the PPA also exhibits preferences for low-level contour statistics, including rectilinearity and cardinal orientations, that are not directly predicted by theories of scene- and landmark-selectivity. It is unknown whether these divergent findings of both low- and high-level selectivity in the PPA can be explained by a unified computational theory. To address this issue, we fit feedforward computational models of visual feature coding to the image-evoked fMRI responses of the PPA, and we performed a series of high-throughput experiments on these models. Our findings show that feedforward models of the PPA exhibit emergent selectivity across multiple levels of complexity, giving rise to seemingly high-level preferences for scenes and for objects that are large, spatially fixed, and inanimate/manmade while simultaneously yielding low-level preferences for rectilinear shapes and cardinal orientations. These results reconcile disparate theories of PPA function in a unified model of feedforward feature coding, and they demonstrate how multifaceted selectivity profiles naturally emerge from the feedforward computations of visual cortex and the natural statistics of images.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTVisual neuroscientists characterize cortical selectivity by identifying stimuli that drive regional responses. A perplexing finding is that many higher-order visual regions exhibit selectivity profiles spanning multiple levels of complexity: they respond to highly complex categories, such as scenes and landmarks, but also to surprisingly simplistic features, such as specific contour orientations. Using large-scale computational analyses and human brain imaging, we show how multifaceted selectivity in scene-preferring cortex can emerge from the feedforward, hierarchical coding of visual features. Our work reconciles seemingly divergent findings of selectivity in scene-preferring cortex and suggests that surprisingly simple feedforward feature representations may be central to the category-selective organization of the human visual system.",

    "abstract": "Fragile X (FX) syndrome is one of the leading inherited causes of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). A majority of FX and ASD patients exhibit sensory hypersensitivity, including auditory hypersensitivity or hyperacusis, a condition in which everyday sounds are perceived as much louder than normal. Auditory processing deficits in FX and ASD also afford the opportunity to develop objective and quantifiable outcome measures that are likely to translate between humans and animal models due to the well-conserved nature of the auditory system and well-developed behavioral read-outs of sound perception. Therefore, in this study we characterized auditory hypersensitivity in a Fmr1 knockout (KO) transgenic rat model of FX using an operant conditioning task to assess sound detection thresholds and suprathreshold auditory reaction time-intensity (RT-I) functions, a reliable psychoacoustic measure of loudness growth, at a variety of stimulus frequencies, bandwidths and durations. Male Fmr1 KO and littermate WT rats both learned the task at the same rate and exhibited normal hearing thresholds. However, Fmr1 KO rats had faster auditory RTs over a broad range of intensities and steeper RT-I slopes than WT controls, perceptual evidence of excessive loudness growth in Fmr1 KO rats. Furthermore, we found that Fmr1 KO animals exhibited abnormal perceptual integration of sound duration and bandwidth, with diminished temporal but enhanced spectral integration of sound intensity. Because temporal and spectral integration of sound stimuli were altered in opposite directions in Fmr1 KO rats, this suggests that abnormal RTs in these animals are evidence of aberrant auditory processing rather than generalized hyperactivity or altered motor responses. Together, these results are indicative of fundamental changes to low-level auditory processing in Fmr1 KO animals. Finally, we demonstrated that antagonism of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) selectively and dose-dependently restored normal loudness growth in Fmr1 KO rats, suggesting a pharmacologic approach for alleviating sensory hypersensitivity associated with FX. This study leverages the tractable nature of the auditory system and the unique behavioral advantages of rats to provide important insights into the nature of a centrally important yet understudied aspect of FX and ASD.",

    "abstract": "One major question in neuroscience is how to relate connectomes to neural activity, circuit function, and learning. We offer an answer in the peripheral olfactory circuit of the Drosophila larva, composed of olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) connected through feedback loops with interconnected inhibitory local neurons (LNs). We combine structural and activity data and, using a holistic normative framework based on similarity-matching, we propose a biologically plausible mechanistic model of the circuit. Our model predicts the ORN [-&gt;] LN synaptic weights found in the connectome and demonstrate that they reflect correlations in ORN activity patterns. Additionally, our model explains the relation between ORN [-&gt;] LN and LN - LN synaptic weight and the arising of different LN types. This global synaptic organization can autonomously arise through Hebbian plasticity, and thus allows the circuit to adapt to different environments in an unsupervised manner. Functionally, we propose LNs extract redundant input correlations and dampen them in ORNs, thus partially whitening and normalizing the stimulus representations in ORNs. Our work proposes a comprehensive framework to combine structure, activity, function, and learning, and uncovers a general and potent circuit motif that can learn and extract significant input features and render stimulus representations more efficient.\n\nSignificanceThe brain represents information with patterns of neural activity. At the periphery, due to the properties of the external world and of encoding neurons, these patterns contain correlations, which are detrimental for stimulus discrimination. We study the peripheral olfactory neural circuit of the Drosophila larva, that preprocesses neural representations before relaying them to higher brain areas. A comprehensive understanding of this preprocessing is, however, lacking. Here, we propose a mechanistic and normative framework describing the function of the circuit and predict the circuits synaptic organization based on the circuits input neural activity. We show how the circuit can autonomously adapt to different environments, extracts stimulus features, and decorrelate and normalize input representations, which facilitates odor discrimination downstream.",
