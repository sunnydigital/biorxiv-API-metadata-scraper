    "abstract": "SMAD4 regulates gene expression in response to BMP and TGF{beta} signal transduction and is required for diverse morphogenetic processes, but its target genes have remained largely elusive. Here, we use an epitope-tagged Smad4 allele for ChIP-seq analysis together with transcriptome analysis of wild-type and mouse forelimb buds lacking Smad4 in the mesenchyme. This analysis identifies the SMAD4 target genes during establishment of the feedback signaling system and establishes that SMAD4 predominantly mediates BMP signal-transduction during early limb bud development. Unexpectedly, the initial analysis reveals that the expression of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes is precociously down-regulated and intracellular cholesterol levels reduced in Smad4-deficient limb bud mesenchymal progenitors. The SMAD4 target GRNs includes genes, whose expression in the anterior limb bud is up-regulated by interactions of SMAD4 complexes with enhancers active in the anterior mesenchyme. This reveals a predominant function of SMAD4 in up-regulating target gene expression in the anterior limb bud mesenchyme. Analysis of differentially expressed genes that are shared between Smad4- and Shh-deficient limb buds corroborates the positive role of SMAD4 in transcriptional regulation of anterior genes and reveals a repressive effect on posterior genes that are positively regulated by SHH signaling. This analysis uncovers the overall opposing effects of SMAD4-mediated BMP and SHH signalling on transcriptional regulation during early limb bud development. In summary, this analysis indicates that during early digit patterning and limb bud outgrowth, the anterior/proximal and proximo/distal expression dynamics of co-regulated genes are controlled by distinct and contrasting trans-regulatory inputs from SHH and SMAD4-mediated BMP signal transduction.",

    "abstract": "Pharmacological chaperones represent a class of therapeutic compounds for treating protein misfolding diseases. One of the most prominent examples is the FDA-approved pharmacological chaperone lumacaftor (VX-809), which has transformed cystic fibrosis (CF) therapy. CF is a fatal disease caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). VX-809 corrects folding of F508del CFTR, the most common patient mutation, yet F508del exhibits only mild VX-809 response. In contrast, rarer mutations P67L and L206W are hyper-responsive to VX-809, while G85E is non-responsive. Despite the clinical success of VX-809, the mechanistic origin for the distinct susceptibility of mutants remains unclear. Here, we use interactomics to characterize the impact of VX-809 on proteostasis interactions of P67L and L206W and compare these to F508del and G85E. We determine hyper-responsive mutations P67L and L206W exhibit decreased interactions with proteasomal, and autophagy degradation machinery compared to F508del and G85E. We then show inhibiting the proteasome attenuates P67L and L206W VX-809 response, and inhibiting the lysosome attenuates F508del VX-809 response. Our data suggests a previously unidentified but required role for protein degradation in VX-809 correction. Furthermore, we present an approach for identifying proteostasis characteristics of mutant-specific therapeutic response to pharmacological chaperones.",

    "abstract": "Collapsing glomerulopathy is a histologically distinct variant of focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis that presents with heavy proteinuria and portends a poor prognosis. Collapsing glomerulopathy can be triggered by viral infections such as HIV and SARS-CoV-2. Transcriptional profiling of collapsing glomerulopathy lesions is difficult since only a few glomeruli may exhibit this histology within a kidney biopsy and the mechanisms driving this heterogeneity are unknown. Therefore, we used recently developed digital spatial profiling (DSP) technology which permits quantification of mRNA at the level of individual glomeruli. Using DSP, we profiled 1,852 transcripts in glomeruli from HIV and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with biopsy confirmed collapsing glomerulopathy. The increased resolution of DSP uncovered heterogeneity in glomerular transcriptional profiles that were missed in early laser capture microdissection studies of pooled glomeruli. Focused validation using immunohistochemistry and RNA in situ hybridization showed good concordance with DSP results. Therefore, DSP represents a powerful method to dissect transcriptional programs of pathologically discernible kidney lesions.",

    "abstract": "An ideal protective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 should not only be effective in preventing disease, but also in preventing virus transmission. It should also be well accepted by the population and have a simple logistic chain. To fulfill these criteria, we developed a thermostable, orally administered vaccine that can induce a robust mucosal neutralizing immune response. We used our platform based on retrovirus-derived enveloped virus-like particles (e-VLPs) harnessed with variable surface proteins (VSPs) from the intestinal parasite Giardia lamblia, affording them resistance to degradation and the triggering of robust mucosal cellular and antibody immune responses after oral administration. We made e-VLPs expressing various forms of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (S), with or without membrane protein (M) expression. We found that prime-boost administration of VSP-decorated e-VLPs expressing a pre-fusion stabilized form of S and M triggers robust mucosal responses against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and hamsters, which translate into complete protection from a viral challenge. Moreover, they dramatically boosted the IgA mucosal response of intramuscularly injected vaccines. We conclude that our thermostable orally administered e-VLP vaccine could be a valuable addition to the current arsenal against SARS-CoV-2, in a stand-alone prime-boost vaccination strategy or as a boost for existing vaccines.",

As SARS-CoV-2 is a Biosafety level (BSL)-3 pathogen, real world testing of heat as a sanitation method for public and private vehicles becomes a challenge, requiring a surrogate coronavirus that can be handled safely outside of a BSL-3 facility. In this study, we used Bovine Coronavirus (BCoV) as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 to test the efficacy of heat-based betacoronavirus inactivation. In vitro, a 30-minute exposure to 56{degrees}C completely inactivated BCoV in solution, and a 15-minute exposure reduced recovery of BCoV >1000-fold. When heated to 56{degrees}C for 15 minutes, the infectivity of BCoV spotted and dried on typical porous and non-porous automobile interior materials was reduced by 99 - 99.99%. When BCoV was spotted and dried on hard plastic (seat) material placed inside an out of service transit bus, 56{degrees}C heat for 30 minutes reduced BCoV infectivity 85 - 99.5%. Thus, 56{degrees}C is an accessible, rapid, and effective method to inactivate coronaviruses inside motor vehicles.",

Recent data suggest that symptoms and general malaise may continue long after the infection has ended in recovered patients, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 infection has profound consequences in the host cells. Here we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection can trigger a DNA damage response (DDR) in African green monkey kidney cells (Vero E6). We observed a transcriptional upregulation of the Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related protein (ATR) in infected cells. In addition, we observed enhanced phosphorylation of CHK1, a downstream effector of the ATR DNA damage response, as well as H2AX. Strikingly, SARS-CoV-2 infection lowered the expression of TRF2 shelterin-protein complex, and reduced telomere lengths in infected Vero E6 cells. Thus, our observations suggest SARS-CoV-2 may have pathological consequences to host cells beyond evoking an immunopathogenic immune response.",

    "abstract": "Parental age at reproduction influences offspring size and survival by affecting prenatal and postnatal conditions in a wide variety of species, including humans. However, most investigations into this manifestation of ageing focus upon maternal age effects; the effects of paternal age and interactions between maternal and paternal age are often neglected. Furthermore, even when maternal age effects are studied, pre- and postnatal effects are confounded. Using a cross-fostered experimental design, we investigated the joint effects of paternal and pre- and postnatal maternal ages on numerous offspring outcomes in a laboratory population of a species of burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides. When we correct our tests for significance for multiple comparisons, we found no clear evidence for any parental effect senescence acting on egg size, larval weight, or larval survival. Nor did we find a statistical effect of paternal or egg producer age on the outcomes of foster mothers as measured by weight change experienced during caregiving. These findings are consistent with recent negative results reported in a similar study of N. vespilloides maternal age effects while also expanding these to other offspring traits and to paternal age effects. We discuss how the peculiar life history of this species may promote selection to resist the evolution of parental age effects, and how this might have influenced our ability to detect senescence.",

STRIDE accurately estimated the cell-type proportions and showed balanced specificity and sensitivity compared to existing methods. We demonstrate STRIDEs utility by applying it to different spatial platforms and biological systems. Deconvolution by STRIDE not only mapped rare cell types to spatial locations but also improved the identification of spatial localized genes and domains. Moreover, topics discovered by STRIDE were associated with cell-type-specific functions, and could be further used to integrate successive sections and reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of tissues. Taken together, STRIDE is a versatile and extensible tool for integrated analysis of spatial and single-cell transcriptomics and is publicly available at https://github.com/wanglabtongji/STRIDE.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundBoth modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy regimens have been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with pancreatic cancer, and are often used interchangeably as the standard of care. Preclinical studies often do not use these regimens, since administering these multiagent approaches can be difficult. In this study, we assessed the feasibility of administering these two chemotherapy regimens in spontaneous pancreatic tumors using KPC mice with the ultimate goal of advancing preclinical studies.\n\nMethodsKPC mice were created by breeding KrasLSL-G12D/+ to Trp53fl/fl;Ptf1Cre/+, resulting in KrasLSL-G12D/+;p53fl/+;Ptf1Cre/+ mice. At 14 weeks of age, mice were palpated for spontaneous tumor growth that was verified using ultrasounds. Mice with tumors under 15 mm in diameter were used. The mice were assigned to one of seven treatment regimens: 1 cycle of mFOLFIRINOX (FFX X1), 2 cycles of mFOLFIRINOX (FFX X2), 1 cycle of mFOLFIRINOX with 40Gy SBRT (FFX SBRT), 1 cycle of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GEM/AB X1), 2 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel (GEM/AB X2), 2 cycles of gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel with 40Gy SBRT (GEM/AB SBRT), or no chemotherapy treatment (control).\n\nResultsIn total, 92 mice were included. The median OS in the FFX X2 group was slightly longer that the median OS in the FFX X1 group (15 days vs 11 days, P=0.003). Mice in the GEM/AB X2 group had longer OS when compared to mice in the GEM/AB X1 group (33.5 vs 13 days, P=0.001). Mice treated with chemotherapy survived longer than untreated control animals (median OS: 6.5 days, P <0.001). Moreover, in mice treated with chemotherapy, mice that received 2 cycles of GEM/AB X2 had the longest survival, while the FFX X1 group had the poorest OS (P <0.001). Lastly, chemotherapy followed by consolidative SBRT trended towards increased local control and survival.\n\nConclusionsWe demonstrate the utility and feasibility of clinicall relevant mFOLFIRINOX and gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in preclinical models of pancreatic cancer.",

    "abstract": "In neuroimaging, spatial normalization is an important step that maps an individuals brain onto a template brain permitting downstream statistical analyses. Yet, in infant neuroimaging, there remain several technical challenges that have prevented the establishment of a standardized template for spatial normalization. Thus, many different approaches are used in the literature. To quantify the popularity and variability of these approaches in infant neuroimaging studies, we performed a systematic review of infant MRI studies from 2000 to 2020. Here, we present results from 833 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Studies were classified into 1) processing data in single subject space, 2) using a predefined, or \"off the shelf\", template, 3) creating a study specific template or 4) using a hybrid of these methods. We found that across the studies in the systematic review, single subject space was the most used (no common space). This was the most used common space for DWI and structural MRI studies while fMRI studies preferred off the shelf atlases. We found a pattern such that more recently published studies are more commonly using off the shelf atlases. When considering special populations, preterm studies most used single subject space while, when no special populations were being analyzed, an off the shelf template was most common. The most used off the shelf templates were the UNC Infant Atlases (26.1%). Using a systematic review of infant neuroimaging studies, we highlight a lack of an established \"standard\" template brain in these studies.",

Approximately 90% of PD cases are due to a complex interaction between age, genes, and environmental factors, and epigenetic marks are thought to mediate the relationship between aging, genetics, the environment, and disease risk. To date, there are a small number of published genome-wide studies of DNA modifications in PD, but none accounted for cell-type or sex in their analyses. Given the hetereogeneity of bulk brain tissue samples and known sex differences in PD risk, progression, and severity, these are critical variables to account for. In this first genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation in an enriched neuronal population from PD post-mortem parietal cortex, we report sex-specific PD-associated methylation changes in PARK7 (DJ-1), SLC17A6 (VGLUT2), PTPRN2 (IA-2{beta}), NR4A2 (NURR1), and other genes involved in developmental pathways, neurotransmitter packaging and release, and axon and neuron projection guidance.",

    "abstract": "Monocyte-derived macrophages are key players in tissue homeostasis and disease regulated by a variety of signaling molecules. Recent literature has highlighted the ability for biogenic amines to regulate macrophage functions, but the mechanisms governing biogenic amine signaling on and around immune cells remains nebulous. In the central nervous system, biogenic amine transporters are regarded as the master regulators of neurotransmitter signaling. While we and others have shown macrophages express these transporters, relatively little is known of their function on these cells. To address these knowledge gaps, we interrogated the function of norepinephrine (NET) and dopamine (DAT) transporters on human monocyte-derived macrophages. We found that both NET and DAT are present and can uptake substrate from the extracellular space at baseline. Not only was DAT expressed in cultured macrophages, but it was also detected in a subset of intestinal macrophages in situ. Surprisingly, we discovered a NET-independent, DAT-mediated immuno-modulatory mechanism in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). LPS induced reverse transport of dopamine through DAT, engaging autocrine/paracrine signaling loop that regulated the macrophage response. Removing this signaling loop enhanced the pro-inflammatory response to LPS. Finally, we found that this DAT-immune axis was disrupted in disease. Collectively, our data introduce a novel role for DAT in the regulation of innate immunity during health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a high-risk pregnancy complication that is associated with metabolic disorder phenotypes, such as abnormal blood glucose and obesity. The link between microbiota and diet management contributes to metabolic homeostasis in GDM. Therefore, it is crucial to understand the structure of the gut microbiota in GDM and to explore the effect of dietary management on the microbiota structure. In this study, we analyzed the composition of the gut microbiota between 27 GDM and 30 healthy subjects at two time points using Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. The taxonomy analyses suggested that the overall bacteria clustered by diabetes status, rather than diet intervention. Of particular interest, the phylum Acidobacteria in GDM was significantly increased, and positively correlated with blood glucose levels. Moreover, Partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed that certain genera in the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Lentisphaerae characterized the GDM gut microbiota. Correlation analysis indicated that blood glucose levels and BMI index were correlated with the relative abundance of SCFAS-producing genera. Through the comparison between the GDM and healthy samples with or without diet intervention, we discovered that the role of short-term diet management in GDM processes is associated with the change in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and some specific taxa, rather than an alternative gut microbial pattern. Our study have important implications for understanding the beneficial effects of diet intervention on the specific gut microbiota and thus possibly their metabolism in pregnant women with GDM.\n\nImportanceUnderstanding the composition and dynamics of the gut microbiota in GDM women under diet intervention is important because there may be opportunities for preventive strategies. We examined the relationships between GDM gut microbiota at two times before and after the diet intervention during second trimester of pregnancy and clinical characteristics in cohort of GDM women. We found that short-term diet management in GDM processes is associated with changes in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio and some specific taxa rather than an alternative gut microbial pattern. Our study highlights the importance of considering diet intervention as the rescue of microbial dysfunction of GDM disease and can serve as a strategy for early prevention in future study.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 is a highly pathogenic virus that evades anti-viral immunity by interfering with host protein synthesis, mRNA stability, and protein trafficking. The SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) uses its C-terminal domain to block the mRNA entry channel of the 40S ribosome to inhibit host protein synthesis. However, how SARS-CoV-2 circumvents Nsp1-mediated suppression for viral protein synthesis and if the mechanism can be targeted therapeutically remain unclear. Here we show that N- and C-terminal domains of Nsp1 coordinate to drive a tuned ratio of viral to host translation, likely to maintain a certain level of host fitness while maximizing replication. We reveal that the SL1 region of the SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR is necessary and sufficient to evade Nsp1-mediated translational suppression. Targeting SL1 with locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) inhibits viral translation and makes SARS-CoV-2 5 UTR vulnerable to Nsp1 suppression, hindering viral replication in vitro at a nanomolar concentration. Thus, SL1 allows Nsp1 to switch infected cells from host to SARS-CoV-2 translation, presenting a therapeutic target against COVID-19 that is conserved among immune-evasive variants. This unique strategy of unleashing a virus own virulence mechanism against itself could force a critical trade off between drug resistance and pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "While the number of human cases of mosquito-borne diseases has increased in North America in the last decade, accurate modeling of mosquito population density has remained a challenge. Longitudinal mosquito trap data over the many years needed for model calibration is relatively rare. In particular, capturing the relative changes in mosquito abundance across seasons is necessary for predicting the risk of disease spread as it varies from year to year. We developed a process-based mosquito population model that captures life-cycle egg, larva, pupa, adult stages, and diapause for Culex pipiens and Culex restuans mosquito populations. Mosquito development through these stages is a function of time, temperature, daylight hours, and aquatic habitat availability. The time-dependent parameters are informed by both laboratory studies and mosquito trap data from the Greater Toronto Area. The model incorporates city-wide water-body gauge and precipitation data as a proxy for aquatic habitat. This approach accounts for the nonlinear interaction of temperature and aquatic habitat variability on the mosquito life stages. We demonstrate that the full model predicts the yearly variations in mosquito populations better than a statistical model using the same data sources. This improvement in modeling mosquito abundance can help guide interventions for reducing mosquito abundance in mitigating mosquito-borne diseases like the West Nile virus.",

    "abstract": "Many plant viruses are transmitted by insect vectors. Transmission can be described as persistent or non-persistent depending on rates of acquisition, retention, and inoculation of virus. Much experimental evidence has accumulated indicating vectors can prefer to settle and/or feed on infected versus noninfected host plants. For persistent transmission, vector preference can also be conditional, depending on the vectors own infection status. Since viruses can alter host plant quality as a resource for feeding, infection potentially also affects vector population dynamics. Here we use mathematical modelling to develop a theoretical framework addressing the effects of vector preferences for landing, settling and feeding - as well as potential effects of infection on vector population density - on plant virus epidemics. We explore the consequences of preferences that depend on the host (infected or healthy) and vector (viruliferous or nonviruliferous) phenotypes, and how this is affected by the form of transmission, persistent or non-persistent. We show how different components of vector preference have characteristic effects on both the basic reproduction number and the final incidence of disease. We also show how vector preference can induce bistability, in which the virus is able to persist even when it cannot invade from very low densities. Feedbacks between plant infection status, vector population dynamics and virus transmission potentially lead to very complex dynamics, including sustained oscillations. Our work is supported by an interactive interface https://plantdiseasevectorpreference.herokuapp.com/. Our model reiterates the importance of coupling virus infection to vector behaviour, life history and population dynamics to fully understand plant virus epidemics.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYPlant virus diseases - which cause devastating epidemics in plant populations worldwide - are most often transmitted by insect vectors. Recent experimental evidence indicates how vectors do not choose between plants at random, but instead can be affected by whether plants are infected (or not). Virus infection can cause plants to \"smell\" different, because they produce different combinations of volatile chemicals, or \"taste\" different, due to chemical changes in infected tissues. Vector reproduction rates can also be affected when colonising infected versus uninfected plants. Potential effects on epidemic spread through a population of plants are not yet entirely understood. There are also interactions with the mode of virus transmission. Some viruses can be transmitted after only a brief probe by a vector, whereas others are only picked up after an extended feed on an infected plant. Furthermore there are differences in how long vectors remain able to transmit the virus. This ranges from a matter of minutes, right up to the entire lifetime of the insect, depending on the plant-virus-vector combination under consideration. Here we use mathematical modelling to synthesise all this complexity into a coherent theoretical framework. We illustrate our model via an online interface https://plantdiseasevectorpreference.herokuapp.com/.",

    "abstract": "Cellular proliferation depends on the accurate and timely replication of the genome. Several genetic diseases are caused by mutations in key DNA replication genes; however, it remains unclear whether these genes influence the normal program of DNA replication timing. Similarly, the factors that regulate DNA replication dynamics are poorly understood. To systematically identify trans-acting modulators of replication timing, we profiled replication in 184 cell lines from three cell types, encompassing 60 different gene knockouts or genetic diseases. Through a rigorous approach that considers the background variability of replication timing, we concluded that most samples displayed normal replication timing. However, mutations in two genes showed consistently abnormal replication timing. The first gene was RIF1, a known modulator of replication timing. The second was MCM10, a highly conserved member of the pre-replication complex. MCM10 mutant cells demonstrated replication timing variability comprising 46% of the genome and at different locations than RIF1 knockouts. Replication timing alterations in MCM10-mutant cells was predominantly comprised of replication initiation defects. Taken together, this study demonstrates the remarkable robustness of the human replication timing program and reveals MCM10 as a novel modulator of DNA replication timing.",

Good quality meat and great adaptability to culture systems are some of its remarkable farming features. To support studies into the genetics and genomics of the tambaqui, we have produced the first high-quality genome for the species. We combined Illumina and PacBio sequencing technologies to generate a reference genome, assembled with 39X coverage of long reads and polished to a QV=36 with 130X coverage of short reads. The genome was assembled into 1,269 scaffolds to a total of 1,221,847,006 bases, with a scaffold N50 size of 40 Mb where 93% of all assembled bases were placed in the largest 54 scaffolds that corresponds to the diploid karyotype of the tambaqui. Furthermore, the NCBI Annotation Pipeline annotated genes, pseudogenes, and non-coding transcripts using the RefSeq database as evidence, guaranteeing a high-quality annotation. A Genome Data Viewer for the tambaqui was produced which benefits any groups interested in exploring unique genomic features of the species. The availability of a highly accurate genome assembly for tambaqui provides the foundation for novel insights about ecological and evolutionary facets and is a helpful resource for aquaculture purposes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundGlioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive and frequent primary brain tumor during adulthood. One of the major treatments is the association of surgery and a combination of chemo and radiotherapies. Despite its immediate efficiency, it fails to prevent the cancer recurrence in the irradiated area due to radioresistance mechanisms.\n\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs or miR) are small non-coding, single strand RNA molecules encoding to various specific genes and able to regulate their expression and induce the tumor cell survival leading to radioresistance. Small extracellular vesicles (EVs), or exosomes released by tumor cells in tumor microenvironment and blood circulation are able to transport and diffuse miRNAs and affect the microenvironment by spreading the miRNAs, which drive radioresistance.\n\nAimsO_LITo identify the variations of miRNAs expression induced by irradiation in human glioblastoma U87-MG cells and their secreted exosomes collected in supernatants.\nC_LIO_LITo analyze the miRNAs variations in EVs-derived from the plasma of patients during radiotherapy, in order to identify a miRNA signature induced by radiotherapy in a liquid biopsy.\nC_LI\n\nMateriel and methodsU87-MG cells were cultured on plates and exposed to irradiation. miRNAs analyzes were performed in cells and in EVs isolated from cell supernatants to determine miRNAs expressions both in cells and in secreted exosomes before and after irradiation.\n\nPlasma-derived EVs were collected from 4 glioblastoma patients before and after surgery and radiotherapy treatments.\n\nConclusionThe analysis of miRNAs expression profiles in both GBM cells and their derived EVs revealed that miR profile changes after irradiation. However, the number of similar miR between cells or EVs, following cell irradiation, was restricted to 3 miRs alone suggesting that the irradiation-induced changes in the miR profile in the cells and their EVs are not closely linked. In this context, the miR profile in EVs from patients plasma was investigated to establish a potential link with the miRNAs profile observed in EVs from irradiated cells and to assess its relationship with the response to radiotherapy. Three miRs (different from those identified in cells) were common between EVs derived from cells and patients derived-exosomes. These miRs detected in circulating EVs could provide a specific and reliable signature in response to ionizing radiation, which could be useful for monitoring the effectiveness of radiotherapy. Further experiments on a larger patients population with clinical data could also help to define whether this signature might have a prognostic value on the response to radiotherapy.",

We discovered a new layer of this molecular specialization by revealing that the vertebrate retina expresses the largest number of tissue-enriched microexons of all tissue types. A subset of these microexons is included exclusively in photoreceptor transcripts, particularly in genes involved in cilia biogenesis and in vesicle-mediated transport. This microexon program is regulated by Srrm3, a paralog of the neural microexon regulator Srrm4. Despite both proteins positively regulate retina microexons in vitro, only Srrm3 is highly expressed in mature photoreceptors and its deletion in zebrafish results in widespread downregulation of microexon inclusion, severe photoreceptor alterations and blindness.

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoupling transcranial magnetic stimulation with electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) allows recording the EEG response to a direct, non-invasive cortical perturbation. However, obtaining a genuine TMS-evoked EEG potential requires controlling for several confounds, among which a main source is represented by the auditory evoked potentials (AEPs) associated to the TMS discharge noise (TMS click). This contaminating factor can be in principle prevented by playing a masking noise through earphones.\n\nNew methodHere we release TMS Adaptable Auditory Control (TAAC), a highly flexible, open-source, Matlab(R)-based interface that generates in real-time customized masking noises. TAAC creates noises starting from the stimulator-specific TMS click and tailors them to fit the individual, subject-specific click perception by mixing and manipulating the standard noises in both time and frequency domains.\n\nResultsWe showed that TAAC allows us to provide standard as well as customized noises able to effectively and safely mask the TMS click.\n\nComparison with existing methodsHere, we showcased two customized noises by comparing them to two standard noises previously used in the TMS literature (i.e., a white noise and a noise generated from the stimulator-specific TMS click only). For each, we quantified the Sound Pressure Level (SPL; measured by a Head and Torso Simulator - HATS) required to mask the TMS click in a population of 20 healthy subjects. Both customized noises were effective at safe (according to OSHA and NIOSH safety guidelines), lower SPLs with respect to standard noises.\n\nConclusionsAt odds with previous methods, TAAC allows creating effective and safe masking noises specifically tailored on each TMS device and subject. The combination of TAAC with tools for the real-time visualization of TEPs can help control the influence of auditory confounds also in non-compliant patients. Finally, TAAC is a highly flexible and open-source tool, so it can be further extended to meet different experimental requirements.",

    "abstract": "Intelligent behavior requires cognitive control, the ability to act directed by goals despite competing action tendencies triggered by stimuli in the environment. For eye movements, it has recently been discovered that cognitive control is briefly disrupted in urgent situations (Salinas et al., 2019). In a time-window before an urgent response, participants could not help but look at a suddenly appearing visual stimulus, even though their goal was to look away from it. Urgency seemed to provoke a new visual-oculomotor phenomenon: A period in which saccadic eye movements are dominated by external stimuli, and uncontrollable by current goals. This period was assumed to arise from brain mechanisms controlling eye movements and spatial attention, such as those of the frontal eye field. Here, we show that the phenomenon is more general than previously thought. We found that urgency disrupted cognitive control also in well-investigated manual tasks, so that responses were dominated by goal-conflicting stimulus features. This dominance of behavior followed established trial-to-trial signatures of cognitive control that replicate across a variety of tasks. Thus together, these findings reveal that urgency temporarily impairs cognitive control in general, not only at brain mechanisms controlling eye movements.",

We show that the virus-encoded miRNA produces two miRNA isoforms in infected cells by the enzyme Dicer and they are loaded into Argonaute proteins. Moreover, the predominant miRNA isoform targets the 3UTR of interferon-stimulated genes and represses their expression in a miRNA-like fashion. Finally, the two viral miRNA isoforms were detected in nasopharyngeal swabs from COVID-19 patients.

We radio- tracked 14 kraits for an average of 114 days (min: 19, max: 218), with an average of 106 fixes (min: 21, max: 229). We assessed movement pathways and activity with dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement models, evaluated patterns of revisitation to identify site fidelity, and determined whether individuals selected for particular land-use types with Integrated Step Selection Functions. Most individuals displayed some level of attraction to buildings (n = 10) and natural areas (n = 12); we identified a similar unambiguous pattern of attraction to buildings and natural areas at the population level (of our sample). Snakes remained in shelter sites for long periods of time (max = 94 days) and revisited sites on average every 15.45 days. Over 50% of fixes were within human settlements and 37.1% were associated with buildings. We found generally seasonal patterns of activity, with higher activity in wet seasons (when classes are typically in session on campus), and lower activity in the hot season (when there are a number of short breaks causing students to leave campus). These results show frequent proximity between Malayan kraits and humans at Suranaree University of Technology, Thailand; thereby, suggesting a near constant potential for human- wildlife conflict. Despite the fact that no snakebites from this species occurred at the university during our study period, substantial education and awareness training should be considered to raise awareness to ensure continued coexistence on campus.",

    "abstract": "Imaging spectroscopy provides the opportunity to incorporate leaf and canopy optical data into ecological studies, but the extent to which remote sensing of vegetation can enhance the study of belowground processes is not well understood. In grassland systems, aboveground and belowground vegetation quantity and quality are coupled, and both influence belowground microbial processes and nutrient cycling, providing a potential link between remote sensing and belowground processes. We hypothesized that ecosystem productivity, and the chemical, structural and phylogenetic-functional composition of plant communities would be detectable with remote sensing and could be used to characterize belowground plant and soil processes in two grassland biodiversity experiments--the BioDIV experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in Minnesota and the Wood River Nature Conservancy experiment in Nebraska. Specifically, we tested whether aboveground vegetation chemistry and productivity, as detected from airborne sensors, predict soil properties microbial processes and community composition. Imaging spectroscopy data were used to map aboveground biomass and green vegetation cover, functional traits and phylogenetic-functional community composition of vegetation. We examined the relationships between the image-derived variables and soil carbon and nitrogen concentration, microbial community composition, biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, and soil processes, including net nitrogen mineralization. In the BioDIV experiment--which has low overall diversity and productivity despite high variation in each--belowground processes were driven mainly by variation in the amount of organic matter inputs to soils. As a consequence, soil respiration, microbial biomass and enzyme activity, and fungal and bacterial composition and diversity were significantly predicted by remotely sensed vegetation cover. In contrast, at Wood River, where plant diversity and productivity were consistently higher, remotely sensed functional, chemical and phylogenetic composition of vegetation predicted belowground extracellular enzyme activity, microbial biomass, and net nitrogen mineralization rates, while aboveground biomass did not. The strong, contrasting associations between the quantity and chemistry of aboveground inputs with belowground soil processes and properties provide a basis for using imaging spectroscopy to understand belowground processes across productivity gradients in grassland systems. However, a mechanistic understanding of how above and belowground components interact among different ecosystems remains critical to extending these results broadly.",

    "abstract": "Development of affordable and effective vaccines that can also protect vulnerable populations such as the elderly from COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality is a public health priority. Here we took a systematic and iterative approach by testing several SARS-CoV-2 protein antigens and adjuvants to identify a combination that elicits neutralizing antibodies and protection in young and aged mice. In particular, SARS-CoV-2 receptorbinding domain (RBD) displayed as a protein nanoparticle (RBD-NP) was a highly effective antigen, and when formulated with an oil-in-water emulsion containing Carbohydrate fatty acid MonoSulphate derivative (CMS) induced the highest levels of cross-neutralizing antibodies compared to other oil-in-water emulsions or AS01B. Mechanistically, CMS induced antigen retention in the draining lymph node (dLN) and expression of cytokines, chemokines and type I interferon-stimulated genes at both injection site and dLN. Overall, CMS:RBD-NP is effective across multiple age groups and is an exemplar of a SARS-CoV-2 subunit vaccine tailored to the elderly.",

    "abstract": "The precise maintenance of PTEN dosage is crucial for tumor suppression across a wide variety of cancers. Post-transcriptional regulation of Pten heavily relies on regulatory elements encoded by its 3UTR. We previously reported the important diversity of 3UTR isoforms of Pten mRNAs produced through alternative polyadenylation (APA). Here, we reveal the direct regulation of Pten APA by the mammalian cleavage factor I (CFIm) complex, which in turn contributes to PTEN protein dosage. CFIm consists of the UGUA-binding CFIm25 and APA regulatory subunits CFIm59 or CFIm68. Deep sequencing analyses of perturbed (KO and KD) cell lines uncovered the differential regulation of Pten APA by CFIm59 and CFIm68 and further revealed that their divergent functions have widespread impact for APA in transcriptomes. Differentially regulated genes include numerous factors within the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signalling pathway that PTEN counter-regulates. We further reveal a stratification of APA dysregulation among a subset of PTEN-driven cancers, with recurrent alterations among PI3K/Akt pathway genes regulated by CFIm. Our results refine the transcriptome selectivity of the CFIm complex in APA regulation, and the breadth of its impact in PTEN-driven cancers.",

    "abstract": "Migration and adhesion play critical roles in B cells, regulating recirculation between lymphoid organs, migration within lymphoid tissue and interaction with CD4+ T cells. However, there is limited knowledge of how B cells integrate chemokine receptor and integrin signaling with B cell activation to generate efficient humoral responses. Here we show that the WNK1 kinase, a regulator of migration and adhesion, is essential in B cells for T-dependent antibody responses. We demonstrate that WNK1 transduces signals from the BCR, CXCR5 and CD40, and using intravital imaging we show that WNK1 regulates migration of naive and activated B cells, and their interactions with T cells. Unexpectedly, we show that WNK1 is required for BCR- and CD40-induced proliferation, acting through the OXSR1 and STK39 kinases, and for efficient B cell-T cell collaboration in vivo. Thus, WNK1 is critical for humoral immune responses, by regulating B cell migration, adhesion and T cell-dependent activation.\n\nSummaryThe WNK1 kinase is essential in B cells for T-dependent antibody responses because it is activated by signaling from BCR, CXCR5 and CD40 and regulates B cell migration, adhesion, T-dependent activation, and differentiation into germinal center B cells and plasma cells.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic fungal pathogen Candida albicans is normally commensal, residing in the mucosa of most healthy individuals. In susceptible hosts, its filamentous hyphal form can invade epithelial layers leading to superficial or severe systemic infection. Invasion is mainly intracellular, though it causes no apparent damage to host cells. We investigated the invasive lifestyle of C. albicans in vitro using live-cell imaging and the damage-sensitive reporter galectin-3. Quantitative single cell analysis showed that invasion can result in host membrane breaching at different stages of invasion and cell death, or in traversal of host cells without membrane breaching. Membrane labelling and three-dimensional \"volume\" electron microscopy revealed that hyphae can traverse several host cells within trans-cellular tunnels that are progressively remodelled and may undergo  inflations linked to host glycogen stores, possibly during nutrient uptake. Thus, C. albicans invade epithelial tissues by either inflicting or avoiding host damage, the latter facilitated by trans-cellular tunnelling.",

    "abstract": "Trypanosoma brucei gambiense is the primary causative agent of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT), a vector-borne disease endemic to West and Central Africa. The extracellular parasite evades antibody recognition within the host bloodstream by altering its Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat through a process of antigenic variation. The serological tests which are widely used to screen for HAT use VSG as one of the target antigens. However, the VSGs expressed during human infection have not been characterized. Here we use VSG-seq to analyze the VSGs expressed in the blood of patients infected with T. b. gambiense and compared them to VSG expression in T. b. rhodesiense infections in humans as well as T. b. brucei infections in mice. The 44 VSGs expressed during T. b. gambiense infection revealed a striking bias towards expression of type B N-termini (82% of detected VSGs). This bias is specific to T. b. gambiense, which is unique among T. brucei subspecies in its chronic clinical presentation and anthroponotic nature, pointing towards a potential link between VSG expression and pathogenesis. The expressed T. b. gambiense VSGs also share very little similarity to sequences from 36 T. b. gambiense whole genome sequencing datasets, particularly in areas of the VSG protein exposed to host antibodies, suggesting that wild T. brucei VSG repertoires vary more than previously expected. Overall, this work demonstrates new features of antigenic variation in T. brucei gambiense and highlights the importance of understanding VSG repertoires in nature.\n\nSignificance StatementHuman African Trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease primarily caused by the extracellular parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. To avoid elimination by the host, these parasites repeatedly replace their Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) coat. Despite the important role of VSGs in prolonging infection, VSG expression during human infections is poorly understood. A better understanding of natural VSG gene expression dynamics can clarify the mechanisms that T. brucei uses to alter its VSG coat and improve trypanosomiasis diagnosis in humans. We analyzed the expressed VSGs detected in the blood of patients with trypanosomiasis. Our findings indicate that there are features of antigenic variation unique to human-infective T. brucei subspecies and VSGs expressed in natural infection may vary more than previously expected.",

    "abstract": "Many mobile elements take advantage of the highly-conserved chromosome dimer resolution system of bacteria, Xer. They participate in the transmission of antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity determinants. In particular, the toxin-linked cryptic satellite phage (TLC{Phi}) plays an essential role in the continuous emergence of new toxigenic clones of the Vibrio cholerae strain at the origin of the ongoing 7th cholera pandemic. The Xer machinery is composed of two chromosomally-encoded tyrosine recombinases, XerC and XerD. They resolve chromosome dimers by adding a crossover between sister copies of a specific 28 base pair site of bacterial chromosomes, dif. The activity of XerD depends on a direct contact with a cell division protein, FtsK, which spatially and temporally constrains the process. TLC{Phi} encodes for a XerD-activation factor (XafT), which drives the integration of the phage into the dif site of the primary chromosome of V. cholerae independently of FtsK. However, XerD does not bind to the attachment site (attP) of TLC{Phi}, which raised questions on the integration process. Here, we compared the integration efficiency of thousands of synthetic mini-TLC{Phi} plasmids harbouring different attP sites and assessed their stability in vivo. In addition, we compared the efficiency with which XafT and the XerD activation domain of FtsK drive recombination reactions in vitro. Taken together, our results suggest that XafT promotes the formation of synaptic complexes between canonical Xer recombination sites and imperfect sites.",

    "abstract": "Inheritance of aberrant chromosomes can compromise genome integrity and affect cellular fitness. In eukaryotes, surveillance pathways and cell cycle checkpoints monitor for aberrant DNA transmission and the ATR kinase, a regulator of the DNA damage response, plays a pivotal role. Prior work revealed that ATR acts during antigenic variation in Trypanosoma brucei mammal-infective life cycle forms and that its loss is lethal, but how widely ATR operates in genome maintenance is largely unknown. Here, we show that after prolonged ATR depletion by RNAi T. brucei continues to synthesise DNA and enters new rounds of cell division, despite increased genome damage. Furthermore, we detect defective chromosome segregation,  micronuclei formation and disruption of the nuclear architecture. RNA-seq revealed that loss of ATR affects the expression of nearly half the genes in the genome, including both RNA Polymerase I and II transcription. Using ChIP-seq of yH2A and DRIP-seq, we reveal overlapping signals for genome damage and R-loops after ATR depletion in all intergenic regions. In addition, we report reduced R-loop levels and accumulation of yH2A signal within centromeres. Together, our data indicates widespread roles of ATR in T. brucei, including differing roles in R-loop homeostasis during multigene transcription and in chromosome segregation.",

    "abstract": "Analysis of mucin type O-glycans linked to serine/threonine of glycoproteins is technically challenging, in part, due to a lack of effective enzymatic tools that enable their analysis. Recently, several O-glycan-specific endoproteases that can cleave the protein adjacent to the appended glycan have been described. Despite significant progress in understanding the biochemistry of these enzymes, known O-glycoproteases have specificity constrains, such as inefficient cleavage of glycoproteins bearing sialylated O-glycans, high selectivity for certain type of glycoproteins or protein sequence bias, that limit their analytical application. In this study, we examined the capabilities of an immunomodulating metalloprotease (IMPa) from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The peptide substrate sequence selectivity and its impact on IMPa activity was interrogated using an array of synthetic peptides and their glycoforms. We show that IMPa has no specific P1 residue preference and can tolerate most amino acids at the P1 position, except aspartic acid. The enzyme does not cleave between two adjacent O-glycosites, indicating that O-glycosylated serine/threonine is not allowed at position P1. Glycopeptides with as few as two amino acids on either side of an O-glycosite were specifically cleaved by IMPa. Finally, IMPa efficiently cleaved peptides and proteins carrying sialylated and asialylated O-glycans of varying complexity. We present the use of IMPa in a one-step O-glycoproteomics workflow for glycoprofiling of individual purified glycoproteins granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C (CD45) without the need for glycopeptide enrichment. In these examples, IMPa enabled identification of O-glycosites and the range of complex O-glycan structures at each site.",

The memory of these immunological encounters are stored in CRISPR arrays, where spacer sequences record the identity and history of past invaders. Analyzing such CRISPR arrays provide insights into the dynamics of CRISPR-Cas systems and the adaptation of their host bacteria to rapidly changing environments such as the human gut. In this study, we utilized 601 Bacteroides fragilis genome isolates from 12 healthy individuals, 6 of which include longitudinal observations, and 222 available B. fragilis reference genomes to update the understanding of B. fragilis CRISPR-Cas dynamics and their differential activities. Analysis of longitudinal genomic data showed that some CRISPR array structures remained relatively stable over time whereas others involved radical spacer acquisition during some periods, and diverse CRISPR arrays (associated with multiple isolates) co-existed in the same individuals with some persisted over time. Furthermore, features of CRISPR adaptation, evolution, and microdynamics were highlighted through an analysis of host-MGE network, such as modules of multiple MGEs and hosts, reflecting complex interactions between B. fragilis and its invaders mediated through the CRISPR-Cas systems. This work demonstrates the power of using culture-based population genomics to reveal the activities and evolution of the CRISPR-Cas systems associated with gut bacteria in human population. We made available of all annotated CRISPR-Cas systems and their target MGEs, and their interaction network as a web resource at https://omics.informatics.indiana.edu/CRISPRone/Bfragilis.",

    "abstract": "Gram-negative bacteria pose a serious public health concern, primarily due to a higher frequency of antibiotic resistance conferred to them as a result of low permeability of their outer membrane (OM). Antibiotics capable of traversing the OM typically permeate through OM porins; thus, understanding the permeation properties of these porins is instrumental to the development of new antibiotics. A common macroscopic feature of many OM porins is their ability to transition between functionally distinct open and closed states that regulate transport properties and rate. To obtain a molecular basis for these processes, we performed tens of microseconds of molecular dynamics simulations of E. coli OM porin, OmpF. We observed that large-scale motion of the internal loop, L3, leads to widening and narrowing of the pore, suggesting its potential role in gating. Furthermore, Markov state analysis revealed multiple energetically stable conformations of L3 corresponding to open and closed states of the porin. Dynamics between these functional states occurs on the time scale of tens of microseconds and are mediated by the movement of highly conserved acidic residues of L3 to form H-bonds with opposing sides of the barrel wall of the pore. To validate our mechanism, we mutated key residues involved in the gating process that alter the H-bond pattern in the open/closed states and performed additional simulations. These mutations shifted the dynamic equilibrium of the pore towards open or closed states. Complementarily, the mutations favoring the open/closed states lead to increased/decreased accumulation of multiple antibiotics in our whole-cell accumulation assays. Notably, porins containing one of the mutations favoring the closed state has previously been found in antibiotic resistant bacterial strains. Overall, our 180 {micro}s of simulation data (wild type and mutants) with concerted experiments suggests that regulation of the dynamic equilibrium between open and closed states of OM porins could be a mechanism by which Gram-negative bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance.",

A hypoxic gene signature is enriched in triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) and correlates with poor patient survival. Since inhibiting the HIF transcription factors with small molecules is challenging, we sought to identify genes downstream of HIF-1 that could be targeted to block invasion and metastasis. Creatine kinase brain isoform (CKB) was identified as a highly differentially expressed gene in a screen of HIF-1 wild type and knockout mammary tumor cells derived from a transgenic model of metastatic breast cancer. CKB is a cytosolic enzyme that reversibly catalyzes the phosphorylation of creatine, generating phosphocreatine (PCr) in the forward reaction, and regenerating ATP in the reverse reaction. Creatine kinase activity is inhibited by the creatine analog cyclocreatine (cCr). Loss and gain of function genetic approaches were used in combination with cCr therapy to define the contribution of CKB expression or creatine kinase activity to cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and metastasis in ER-negative breast cancers. CKB was necessary for cell invasion in vitro and strongly promoted tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. Similarly, cyclocreatine therapy repressed cell migration, cell invasion, formation of invadopodia, and lung metastasis. Moreover, in common TNBC cell line models, the addition of cCr to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy agents was either additive or synergistic to repress tumor cell growth.",

    "abstract": "Despite extensive studies on the curve-shaped bacterium Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of the diarrheal disease cholera, its virulence-associated regulatory two-component signal transduction system VarS/VarA is not well understood. This pathway, which mainly signals through the downstream protein CsrA, is highly conserved among gamma-proteobacteria, indicating there is likely a broader function of this system beyond virulence regulation. In this study, we investigated the VarA-CsrA signaling pathway and discovered a previously unrecognized link to the shape of the bacterium. We observed that varA-deficient V. cholerae cells showed an abnormal spherical morphology during late-stage growth. Through peptidoglycan (PG) composition analyses, we discovered that these mutant bacteria contained an increased content of disaccharide dipeptides and reduced peptide crosslinks, consistent with the atypical cellular shape. The spherical shape correlated with the CsrA-dependent overproduction of aspartate ammonia lyase (AspA) in varA mutant cells, which likely depleted the cellular aspartate pool; therefore, the synthesis of the PG precursor amino acid meso-diaminopimelic acid was impaired. Importantly, this phenotype, and the overall cell rounding, could be prevented by means of cell wall recycling. Collectively, our data provide new insights into how V. cholerae use the VarA-CsrA signaling system to adjust its morphology upon unidentified external cues in its environment.\n\nSignificance StatementResponsible for the diarrheal disease cholera, the bacterium Vibrio cholerae tightly regulates its virulence program according to external stimuli. Here, we discovered that a sensing-response mechanism involved in the regulation of virulence also controls bacterial shape. We show that V. cholerae lacking this system lose their normal comma shape and become spherical due to an abnormal cell wall composition caused by metabolic changes that reduce available cell wall building blocks. Our study therefore sheds new light on how V. cholerae modulates its morphology based on environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "Gram-positive bacteria are protected by a thick mesh of peptidoglycan (PG) completely engulfing their cells. This PG network is the main component of the bacterial cell wall, it provides rigidity and acts as foundation for the attachment of other surface molecules. Biosynthesis of PG consumes a high amount of cellular resources and therefore requires careful adjustments to environmental conditions.\n\nAn important switch in the control of PG biosynthesis of Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive pathogen with a high infection fatality rate, is the serine/threonine protein kinase PrkA. A key substrate of this kinase is the small cytosolic protein ReoM. We have shown previously that ReoM phosphorylation regulates PG formation through control of MurA stability. MurA catalyzes the first step in PG biosynthesis and the current model suggests that phosphorylated ReoM prevents MurA degradation by the ClpCP protease. In contrast, conditions leading to ReoM dephosphorylation stimulate MurA degradation. How ReoM controls degradation of MurA and potential other substrates is not understood. Also, the individual contribution of the [~]20 other known PrkA targets to PG biosynthesis regulation is unknown.\n\nWe here present murA mutants which escape proteolytic degradation. The release of MurA from ClpCP-dependent proteolysis was able to constitutively activate PG biosynthesis and further enhances the intrinsic cephalosporin resistance of L. monocytogenes. This activation required the RodA3/PBP B3 transglycosylase/transpeptidase pair as additional effectors of the PrkA signaling route. One murA escape mutation not only fully rescued an otherwise non-viable prkA mutant during growth in batch culture and inside macrophages but also overcompensated cephalosporin hypersensitivity. Our data collectively indicate that the main purpose of PrkA-mediated signaling in L. monocytogenes is control of MurA stability during extra- and intracellular growth. These findings have important implications for the understanding of PG biosynthesis regulation and {beta}-lactam resistance of L. monocytogenes and related Gram-positive bacteria.\n\nAuthor SummaryPeptidoglycan (PG) is the main component of the bacterial cell wall and many of the PG synthesizing enzymes are antibiotic targets. We previously have discovered a new signaling route controlling PG production in the human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes. This route also determines the intrinsic resistance of L. monocytogenes against cephalosporins, a group of {beta}-lactam antibiotics. Signaling involves PrkA, a membrane-embedded protein kinase, that is activated during cell wall stress to phosphorylate its target ReoM. Depending on its phosphorylation, ReoM activates or inactivates PG production by controlling the proteolytic stability of MurA, which catalyzes the first step in PG biosynthesis. MurA degradation depends on the ClpCP protease and we here have isolated murA mutations that escape this degradation. Using these mutants, we could show that regulation of PG biosynthesis through control of MurA stability is the primary purpose of PrkA-mediated signaling in L. monocytogenes. Further experiments identified the transglycosylase RodA and the transpeptidase PBP B3 as additional effectors of PrkA signaling. Our results suggest that both proteins act together to translate the signals received by PrkA into intensification of PG biosynthesis. These findings shed new light on the regulation of PG biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria with intrinsic {beta}-lactam resistance.",

    "abstract": "Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a debilitating disease that afflicts over 70 million people worldwide. It is caused by the parasitic nematodes Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori. While efforts to eliminate LF have seen substantial success, complete eradication will likely require more time and resources than predicted. Identifying new drug and vaccine targets in adult filariae could help elimination efforts.\n\nThis studys aim was to evaluate intestinal proteins in adult Brugia malayi worms as possible therapeutic targets. Using siRNA, we successfully inhibited transcripts of four candidate genes: Bma-Serpin, Bma-ShTK, Bma-Reprolysin, and Bma-LAD-2. Of those, Bma-LAD-2, an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule (IgSF CAM), was determined to be essential for adult worm survival. We observed a 70.42% knockdown in Bma-LAD-2 transcript levels 1 day post-siRNA incubation and an 87.02% reduction in protein expression 2 days post-siRNA incubation. This inhibition of Bma-LAD-2 expression resulted in an 80% decrease in worm motility over 6 days, a 93.43% reduction in microfilaria release (Mf) by day 6 post-siRNA incubation, and a significant decrease in MTT reduction. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the loss of microvilli and unraveling of mitochondrial cristae in the intestinal epithelium of Bma-LAD-2 siRNA-treated worms. Strikingly, Bma-LAD-2 siRNA-treated worms exhibited an almost complete loss of pseudocoelomic fluid, suggesting that loss of these tight junctions led to the leakage and subsequent loss of the worms structural integrity. Luciferase immunoprecipitation system assay demonstrated that serum from 30 patients with LF did not have detectable IgE antibodies against Bma-LAD-2, indicating that LF exposure does not result in IgE sensitization to this antigen.\n\nThese results indicate that Bma-LAD-2 is an essential protein for adult Brugia malayi and may be an effective drug or vaccine target. In addition, these findings further validate the strategy of targeting the worm intestine to prevent and treat helminthic infections.\n\nAuthor SummaryBrugia malayi is a parasitic nematode that can cause lymphatic filariasis, a debilitating disease prevalent in tropical and subtropical countries. Significant progress has been made towards eliminating the disease. However, complete eradication may require new therapeutics such as drugs or a vaccine that kill adult filariae. In this study, we identified an immunoglobulin superfamily cell adhesion molecule (Bma-LAD-2) as a potential drug and vaccine candidate. When we knocked down Bma-LAD-2 expression, we observed a decrease in worm motility, fecundity, and metabolism. We also visualized the loss of microvilli, destruction of the mitochondria in the intestinal epithelium, and loss of pseudocoelomic fluid contents after Bma-LAD-2 siRNA treatment. Finally, we demonstrated that serum from filaria-infected patients does not contain preexisting IgE to Bma-LAD-2, which indicates that this antigen would likely be safe to administer as a vaccine in endemic populations.",

In response to mechanical forces, NMIIs mechanoaccumulate at the cell cortex with applied stress. Much less is known about how NMII mechanoaccumulation is mechanistically regulated. In this study, we subject cells in mitosis to compressive forces and show that mitotic cells promote active RhoA mechanoaccumulation, and via ROCK signaling, activate and stabilize NMIIB at the cell cortex. In line with RhoA in activating the myosin motor activity, we further show that the motor activity driving actin filament translocation, but not just the actin-binding function of NMIIB plays a dominant regulatory role in NMIIB mechanoaccumulation. Thus, the motor activity coordinates structural movement and nucleotide state changes to fine-tune actin-binding affinity optimal for NMIIs to generate and respond to forces.",

Here we profiled LBP-8s binding partners using immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. From the 45 identified candidates, we discovered four nuclear factors that are required for the LBP-8-induced longevity. Among them, RPC-2, an RNA Polymerase III core subunit, is also necessary for the nuclear localization of LBP-8. Moreover, we have screened nuclear transport machinery components, and revealed the requirement of the nuclear import, not export, for the LBP-8 longevity effects. Together, these results suggest that the lipid chaperone LBP-8 relies on specific nuclear factors to retain in the nucleus and regulate longevity.",

    "abstract": "Mapping the genetic basis of complex traits is critical to uncovering the biological mechanisms that underlie disease and other phenotypes. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in model organisms can now explain much of the observed heritability in many traits, allowing us to predict phenotype from genotype. However, constraints on power due to statistical confounders in large GWAS and smaller sample sizes in QTL studies still limit our ability to resolve numerous small-effect variants, map them to causal genes, identify pleiotropic effects across multiple traits, and infer non-additive interactions between loci (epistasis). Here, we introduce barcoded bulk quantitative trait locus (BB-QTL) mapping, which allows us to construct, genotype, and phenotype 100,000 offspring of a budding yeast cross, two orders of magnitude larger than the previous state of the art. We use this panel to map the genetic basis of eighteen complex traits, finding that the genetic architecture of these traits involves hundreds of small-effect loci densely spaced throughout the genome, many with widespread pleiotropic effects across multiple traits. Epistasis plays a central role, with thousands of interactions that provide insight into genetic networks. By dramatically increasing sample size, BB-QTL mapping demonstrates the potential of natural variants in high-powered QTL studies to reveal the highly polygenic, pleiotropic, and epistatic architecture of complex traits.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding the genetic basis of important phenotypes is a central goal of genetics. However, the highly polygenic architectures of complex traits inferred by large-scale genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans stand in contrast to the results of quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies in model organisms. Here, we use a barcoding approach to conduct QTL mapping in budding yeast at a scale two orders of magnitude larger than the previous state of the art. The resulting increase in power reveals the polygenic nature of complex traits in yeast, and offers insight into widespread patterns of pleiotropy and epistasis. Our data and analysis methods offer opportunities for future work in systems biology, and have implications for large-scale GWAS in human populations.",

The zoonotic Cryptosporidium parvum and anthroponotic C. hominis cause most human infections. Here, we present a comprehensive whole-genome study of C. hominis, comprising 114 isolates from 16 countries within five continents. We detect two lineages with distinct biology and demography, which diverged circa 500 years ago. We consider these lineages two subspecies and propose the names C. hominis hominis and C. hominis aquapotentis (gp60 subtype IbA10G2). In our study, C. h. hominis is almost exclusively represented by isolates from LMICs in Africa and Asia and appears to have undergone recent population contraction. In contrast, C. h. aquapotentis was found in high-income countries, mainly in Europe, North America and Oceania, and appears to be expanding. Notably, C. h. aquapotentis is associated with high rates of direct human-to-human transmission, which may explain its success in countries with well-developed environmental sanitation infrastructure. Intriguingly, we detected genomic regions of introgression following secondary contact between the subspecies. This resulted in high diversity and divergence in genomic islands of putative virulence genes (GIPVs), including muc5 (CHUDEA2_430) and a hypothetical protein (CHUDEA6_5270). This diversity is maintained by balancing selection, suggesting a coevolutionary arms race with the host.

    "abstract": "RBBP4 is a core subunit of polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and HDAC1/2-containing complexes, which are responsible for histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) methylation and deacetylation respectively. However, the mechanisms by which RBBP4 modulates the functions of these complexes remain largely unknown. We generated viable mouse embryonic stem cell lines with RBBP4 mutations that disturbed methylation and acetylation of H3K27 on target chromatin and found that RBBP4 is required for PRC2 assembly and H3K27me3 establishment on target chromatin. Moreover, in the absence of EED and SUZ12, RBBP4 maintained chromatin binding on PRC2 loci, suggesting that the pre-existence of RBBP4 on nucleosomes serves to recruit PRC2 to restore H3K27me3 on newly synthesized histones. As such, disruption of RBBP4 function led to dramatic changes in transcriptional profiles. In spite of the PRC2 association, we found that transcriptional changes were more closely tied to the deregulation of H3K27ac rather than H3K27me3 where increased levels of H3K27ac were found on numerous cis-regulatory elements, especially putative enhancers. These data suggest that RBBP4 controls acetylation levels by adjusting the activity of HDAC complexes. As histone methylation and acetylation have been implicated in cancer and neural disease, RBBP4 could serve as a potential target for disease treatment.",

    "abstract": "Macadamia, a recently domesticated expanding nut crop in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world, is one of the most economically important genera in the diverse and widely adapted Proteaceae family. All four species of Macadamia are rare in the wild with the most recently discovered, M. jansenii, being endangered. The M. jansenii genome has been used as a model for testing sequencing methods using a wide range of long read sequencing techniques. Here we report a chromosome level genome assembly, generated using a combination of Pacific Biosciences sequencing and Hi-C, comprising 14 pseudo-molecules, with a N50 of 58 Mb and a total 758 Mb genome assembly size of which 56% is repetitive. Completeness assessment revealed that the assembly covered 96.9% of the conserved single copy genes. Annotation predicted 31,591 protein coding genes and allowed the characterization of genes encoding biosynthesis of cyanogenic glycosides, fatty acid metabolism and anti-microbial proteins. Re-sequencing of seven other genotypes confirmed low diversity and low heterozygosity within this endangered species. Important morphological characteristics of this species such as small tree size and high kernel recovery suggest that M. jansenii is an important source of these commercial traits for breeding. As a member of a small group of families that are sister to the core eudicots, this high-quality genome also provides a key resource for evolutionary and comparative genomics studies.",

Here we present an overview of the modules learning goals, describe course resources (available for public use on http://methylothon.com), and relate lessons learned from adapting Methylothon for remote learning during the pandemic in spring of 2021. The original in-person version of the module allows students to isolate their own strains of methylotrophic bacteria from plants they sample from the environment, to identify these using PCR, sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis, and to contribute their strains to original research in a university lab. The adapted version strengthens the focus on bioinformatics and increases its flexibility and accessibility by making the lab portion optional and adopting free web-based tools. Student feedback and graded assignments from Spring 2021 revealed that the lesson was especially effective at introducing the concepts of BLAST and phylogenetic trees, and that students valued and felt inspired by the opportunity to conduct hands-on work and to participate in community science.",

    "abstract": "Infections due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae have recently emerged as one of the most urgent threats to hospitalized patients within the United States and Europe. By far the most common etiological agent of these infections is Klebsiella pneumoniae, frequently manifesting in hospital-acquired pneumonia with a mortality rate of [~]50% even with antimicrobial intervention. We performed transcriptomic analysis of data collected from in vitro characterization of both laboratory and clinical isolates revealed shifts in expression of multiple master metabolic regulators across isolate types. Metabolism has been previously shown to be an effective target for antibacterial therapy, and GENREs have provided a powerful means to accelerate identification of potential targets in silico. Combining these techniques with the transcriptome meta-analysis, we generated context-specific models of metabolism utilizing a well-curated GENRE of K. pneumoniae (iYL1228) to identify novel therapeutic targets. Functional metabolic analyses revealed that both composition and metabolic activity of clinical isolate-associated context-specific models significantly differs from laboratory isolate-associated models of the bacterium. Additionally, we identified increased consumption of L-valine in clinical isolate-specific growth simulations. Importantly, valine has been shown to augment macrophage phagocytosis, and this result could be indicative of an immunosuppressive strategy Klebsiella pneumoniae evolved for survival during infection. These findings warrant future studies for potential efficacy of valine transaminase inhibition as a target against K. pneumoniae infection.\n\nImportanceIncidences of infection by Klebsiella pneumoniae have grown in frequency to become the leading agents of CRE infection among hospitalized patients in the United States and Europe. Transcriptomic meta-analysis of data collected from both laboratory and clinical isolates indicated significant shifts in expression of key transcription factors related to metabolism. Metabolic network reconstructions have previously proven effective for quickly identifying potential targets in silico, therefore we combined these approaches by integrating the transcriptomic data from each isolate type into a well-curated GENRE of K. pneumoniae to predict emergent metabolic patterns. Leveraging this systems-biology approach we found discordant patterns of active metabolism between clinical and laboratory isolates, with a striking difference in L-valine catabolism. Exogenous valine is known to increase macrophage phagocytosis, and our results may support immunomodulatory activity in K. pneumoniae evolved to avoid host clearance.",

    "abstract": "Drug research with animal models is expensive, time-consuming and translation to clinical trials is often poor, resulting in a desire to replace, reduce, and refine the use of animal models. One approach to replace and reduce the use of animal models in research is using in vitro cell-culture models.\n\nTo study bone physiology, bone diseases and drugs, many studies have been published using osteoblast-osteoclast co-cultures. The use of osteoblast-osteoclast co-cultures is usually not clearly mentioned in the title and abstract, making it difficult to identify these studies without a systematic search and thorough review. As a result, researchers are all developing their own methods from the ground up, leading to conceptually similar studies with many methodological differences and, as a direct consequence, incomparable results.\n\nThe aim of this study was to systematically review existing osteoblast-osteoclast co-culture studies published up to 6 January 2020, and to give an overview of their methods, predetermined outcome measures (formation and resorption, and ALP and TRAP quantification as surrogate markers for formation and resorption, respectively), and other useful parameters for analysis. Information regarding these outcome measures was extracted and collected in a database, and each study was further evaluated on whether both the osteoblasts and osteoclasts were analyzed using relevant outcome measures. From these studies, additional details on methods, cells and culture conditions were extracted into a second database to allow searching on more characteristics.\n\nThe two databases presented in this publication provide an unprecedented amount of information on cells, culture conditions and analytical techniques for using and studying osteoblast-osteoclast cocultures. They allow researchers to identify publications relevant to their specific needs and allow easy validation and comparison with existing literature. Finally, we provide the information and tools necessary for others to use, manipulate and expand the databases for their needs.",

    "abstract": "The resumption of coronary artery blood supply is often accompanied by myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury after the occurrence of myocardial infarction, shock, cardiac surgery and other events. Metallothionein-2A (MT2A) has the functions of scavenging free radicals, anti-oxidative stress, anti-apoptosis, anti-autophagy, promoting vascular growth. The activation of p38 MAPK pathway can induce cardiomyocyte apoptosis in H9c2 cardiomyocytes during I/R, thereby aggravating the myocardial I/R injury. However, it is not clear that the effect of MT2A on p38 in cardiomyocytes under I/R. A simulated I/R model was used. Our objective was to investigate the protective effect of MT2A on I/R-caused mortality in H9c2 cardiomyocytes through its influence on p38, as well as the relationships among these processes. The results indicate that both endogenously overexpressed MT2A and exogenously added MT2A can inhibit the active expression of p38 during I/R. Based on these results, I/R induces apoptosis and p-p38 in cardiomyocytes. MT2A can inhibit the active expression of p38. MT2A protects cardiomyocytes from I/R injury, and that p38 is one of the molecules of MT2A against I/R injury in cardiomyocytes.",

    "abstract": "Infiltrative gliomas are the most common neoplasms arising in the brain, and remain largely incurable despite decades of research. A subset of these gliomas contains mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or, less commonly, IDH2 (together called \"IDHmut\"). These mutations alter cellular biochemistry, and IDHmut gliomas are generally less aggressive than IDH wild-type (IDHwt) gliomas. Some preclinical studies and clinical trials have suggested that a ketogenic diet (KD), characterized by low-carbohydrate and high-fat content, may be beneficial in slowing glioma progression. However, not all studies have shown promising results, and to date, no study has addressed whether IDHmut gliomas might be more sensitive to KD. The aim of the current study was to compare the effects of KD in preclinical models of IDHwt versus IDHmut gliomas. In vitro, simulating KD by treatment with the ketone body {beta}-hydroxybutyrate had no effect on the proliferation of patient-derived IDHwt or IDHmut glioma cells. Likewise, a cycling KD, wherein mice alternated between KD and a standard diet (SD), had no effect on the in vivo growth of patient-derived IDHwt or IDHmut gliomas, even though the cycling KD did result in persistently elevated circulating ketones. Furthermore, KD conferred no survival benefit in mice engrafted with Sleeping-Beauty transposase-engineered IDHmut glioma. These data suggest that neither IDHwt nor IDHmut gliomas are particularly responsive to KD.",

    "abstract": "While ATM loss-of-function has long been identified as the genetic cause of Ataxia Telangiectasia (A-T), how this genetic mutation leads to selective and progressive degeneration of cerebellar Purkinje and granule neurons remains unclear. ATM expression is enriched in microglia, the resident immune cell of the central nervous system, throughout cerebellar development and adulthood. Microglial activation has been strongly implicated in neurodegenerative disease and observed in rodent and cellular models of ATM deficiency. Here, we find evidence of prominent inflammation of microglia in cerebellum from A-T patients using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing. A-T microglia have transcriptomic signatures of aging and neurodegenerative disease associated microglia. Pseudotime analysis revealed that activation of A-T microglia preceded upregulation of apoptosis related genes in granule and Purkinje neurons, and microglia exhibited increased neurotoxic cytokine signaling to granule and Purkinje neurons in A-T. To confirm these findings experimentally, we studied microglia and neurons that we generated from A-T patient vs. control induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Transcriptomic profiling of A-T iPSC-derived microglia revealed cell-intrinsic microglial activation of cytokine production and innate immune response pathways compared to controls. Furthermore, adding A-T microglia to co-cultures with either control or A-T iPSC-derived neurons was sufficient to induce cytotoxicity. Taken together, these studies reveal that cell-intrinsic microglial activation may play a critical role in the development and progression of neurodegeneration in Ataxia Telangiectasia.",
