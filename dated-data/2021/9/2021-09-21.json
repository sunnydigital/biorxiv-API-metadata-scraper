    "abstract": "As genome-wide association studies and genetic risk prediction models are extended to globally diverse and admixed cohorts, ancestry deconvolution has become an increasingly important tool. Also known as local ancestry inference (LAI), this technique identifies the ancestry of each region of an individuals genome, thus permitting downstream analyses to account for genetic effects that vary between ancestries. Since existing LAI methods were developed before the rise of massive, whole genome biobanks, they are computationally burdened by these large next generation datasets. Current LAI algorithms also fail to harness the potential of whole genome sequences, falling well short of the accuracy that such high variant densities can enable. Here we introduce Gnomix, a set of algorithms that address each of these points, achieving higher accuracy and swifter computational performance than any existing LAI method, while also enabling portable models that are particularly useful when training data are not shareable due to privacy or other restrictions. We demonstrate Gnomix (and its swift phase correction counterpart Gnofix) on worldwide whole-genome data from both humans and canids and utilize its high resolution accuracy to identify the location of ancient New World haplotypes in the Xoloitzcuintle, dating back over 100 generations.

EHD crystal structures in an open and a closed conformation were previously reported, but structural information on the membrane-bound EHD oligomeric structure has remained enigmatic. Consequently, mechanistic insight into EHD-mediated membrane remodeling is lacking. Here, by using cryo-electron tomography and subtomogram averaging, we determined the structure of an EHD4 filament on a tubular membrane template at an average resolution of 7.6 [A]. Assembly of EHD4 is mediated via interfaces in the G-domain and the helical domain. The oligomerized EHD4 structure resembles the closed conformation, where the tips of the helical domains protrude into the membrane. The variation in filament geometry and tube radius suggests the AMPPNP-bound filament has a spontaneous curvature of approximately 1/70 nm-1. Combining the available structural and functional data, we propose a model of EHD-mediated membrane remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Cisplatin resistance is the main cause of poor clinical prognosis in patients with gastric cancer (GC). Yet, the exact mechanism of cisplatin resistance remains unclear. Recent studies have suggested that exocrine miRNAs found in the tumor microenvironment participates in tumor metastasis and drug resistance. In this study, we discovered that cisplatin-resistant GC cells communicate with the tumor microenvironment by secreting microvesicles. The biologically active miR-769-5p can be integrated into exosomes and delivered to sensitive cells, thereby spreading cisplatin resistance. Mi769-5p was upregulated in GC tissues and enriched in the serum exosomes of cisplatin-resistant patients. Mechanistically, miR-769-5p promotes cisplatin resistance by targeting CASP9 so as to inhibit the downstream caspase pathway and promote the degradation of the apoptosis-related protein p53 through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Targeting miR-769 with its antagonist to treat cisplatin-resistant GC cells can restore the cisplatin response, confirming that exosomal miR-769-5p can be a key regulator of cisplatin resistance in GC. Therefore, exosomal miR-769-5p derived from drug-resistant cells can be used as a potential therapeutic predictor of anti-tumor chemotherapy to enhance the effect of anti-cancer chemotherapy, which provides a new treatment option for GC.",

    "abstract": "Aggressive cancers commonly ferment glucose to lactic acid at high rates, even in the presence of oxygen. This is known as aerobic glycolysis, or the \"Warburg Effect\". It is widely assumed that this is a consequence of the upregulation of glycolytic enzymes. Oncogenic drivers can increase the expression of most proteins in the glycolytic pathway, including the terminal step of exporting H+ equivalents from the cytoplasm. Proton exporters maintain an alkaline cytoplasmic pH, which can enhance all glycolytic enzyme activities, even in the absence of oncogene-related expression changes. Based on this observation, we hypothesized that increased uptake and fermentative metabolism of glucose could be driven by the expulsion of H+ equivalents from the cell. To test this hypothesis, we stably transfected lowly-glycolytic MCF-7, U2-OS, and glycolytic HEK293 cells to express proton exporting systems: either PMA1 (yeast H+-ATPase) or CAIX (carbonic anhydrase 9). The expression of either exporter in vitro enhanced aerobic glycolysis as measured by glucose consumption, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate. This resulted in an increased intracellular pH, and metabolomic analyses indicated that this was associated with an increased flux of all glycolytic enzymes upstream of pyruvate kinase. These cells also demonstrated increased migratory and invasive phenotypes in vitro, and these were recapitulated in vivo by more aggressive behavior, whereby the acid-producing cells formed higher grade tumors with higher rates of metastases. Neutralizing tumor acidity with oral buffers reduced the metastatic burden. Therefore, cancer cells with increased H+ export increase intracellular alkalization, even without oncogenic driver mutations, and this is sufficient to alter cancer metabolism towards a Warburg phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Induced abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis plays an important role in plant tolerance to abiotic stresses, including drought, cold and salinity. However, regulation pathway of the ABA biosynthesis in response to stresses is unclear. Here, we identified a rice miRNA, osa-miR2105 (miR2105), which plays a crucial role in ABA biosynthesis under drought stress. Analysis of expression, transgenic rice and cleavage site showed that OsbZIP86 is a target gene of miR2105. Subcellular localization and luciferase activity assays showed that OsbZIP86 is a nuclear transcription factor. In vivo and in vitro analyses showed that OsbZIP86 directly binds to the promoter of OsNCED3, and interacts with OsSAPK10, resulting in enhanced-expression of OsNCED3. Transgenic rice plants with knock-down of miR2105 or overexpression of OsbZIP86 showed higher ABA content, more tolerance to drought, a lower rate of water loss, more stomatal closure than wild type rice ZH11 under drought stress. These rice plants showed no penalty with respect to agronomic traits under normal conditions. By contrast, transgenic rice plants with miR2105 overexpression, OsbZIP86 downregulation, or OsbZIP86 knockout displayed less tolerance to drought stress and other phenotypes. Collectively, our results show that a regulatory network of  miR2105-OsSAPK10/OsbZIP86-OsNCED3 control ABA biosynthesis in response to drought stress.\n\nOne-sentence summary miR2105-OsbZIP86-OsNCED3 module plays crucial role in mediating ABA biosynthesis to contribute to drought tolerance with no penalty with respect to agronomic traits under normal conditions.",

    "abstract": "Reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is assumed to occur in two distinct phases: initial recovery mediated by short-term progenitors and long-term repopulation by multipotent HSCs which do not contribute to hematopoietic reconstitution during the first 6-9 months. We have previously reported the transplantation and exclusive engraftment of the HSC-enriched CD34+CD45RA-CD90+ phenotype in a nonhuman primate model. Here, we closely followed the clonal diversity and kinetics in these animals. Enhanced sampling and high density clonal tracking within the first 3 month revealed that multipotent HSCs actively contributed to the early phases of neutrophil recovery and became the dominant source for blood cells as early as 50 days after transplant. Longitudinal changes in clonal diversity supported a stochastic engraftment of HSCs with the majority of HSCs clones vanishing early during neutrophil recovery and a smaller fraction of HSC clones expanding into bigger pools to support long-term hematopoiesis. In contrast to the bi-phasic model, we propose that hematopoietic recovery after myeloablation and transplantation is primarily derived from HSCs in a stochastic manner rather than in two phases by independent cell populations.",

    "abstract": "The cercozoan amoeba Paulinella chromatophora contains photosynthetic organelles - termed chromatophores - that evolved from a cyanobacterium [~]100 million years ago, independently from plastids in plants and algae. Despite its more recent origin, at least one third of the chromatophore proteome consists of nucleus-encoded proteins that are imported by an unknown mechanism across the chromatophore double envelope membranes. Chromatophore-targeted proteins fall into two classes. Proteins exceeding 250 amino acids carry a conserved N-terminal sequence extension, termed the  chromatophore transit peptide (crTP), that is presumably involved in guiding these proteins into the chromatophore. Short imported proteins do not carry discernable targeting signals. To explore whether the import of protein is accompanied by their N-terminal processing, here we used a mass spectrometry-based approach to determine protein N-termini in Paulinella chromatophora and identified N-termini of 208 chromatophore-localized proteins. Our study revealed extensive N-terminal modifications by acetylation and proteolytic processing in both, the nucleus and chromatophore-encoded fraction of the chromatophore proteome. Mature N-termini of 37 crTP-carrying proteins were identified, of which 30 were cleaved in a common processing region. Our results imply that the crTP mediates trafficking through the Golgi, is bipartite and surprisingly only the N-terminal third ( part 1) becomes cleaved upon import, whereas the rest ( part 2) remains at the mature proteins. In contrast, short imported proteins remain largely unprocessed. Finally, this work sheds light on N-terminal processing of proteins encoded in an evolutionary-early-stage photosynthetic organelle and suggests host-derived post-translationally acting factors involved in dynamic regulation of the chromatophore-encoded chromatophore proteome.\n\nOne sentence summaryProteins targeted to the evolutionary-early-stage photosynthetic organelle of Paulinella carry a bipartite N-terminal targeting sequence that is only partially removed upon protein import.",

    "abstract": "Endothelial cells (EC) lining blood vessels are exposed to mechanical forces, such as shear stress exerted by the flowing blood. These forces control many aspects of EC biology, including vascular tone, cell migration and proliferation in addition to cell size and shape. Despite a good understanding of the genes and signaling pathways responding to shear stress, our insights into the transcriptional regulation of these responses is much more limited. In particular, we do not know the different sets of regulatory elements (enhancers) that might control increases or decreases in gene expression. Here, we set out to study changes in the chromatin landscape of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to laminar shear stress. To do so, we performed ChIP-Seq for H3K27 acetylation, indicative of active enhancer elements and ATAC-Seq to mark regions of open chromatin in addition to RNA-Seq on HUVEC exposed to 6 hours of laminar shear stress. Our results show a correlation of gained and lost enhancers with up- and downregulated genes, respectively. DNA motif analysis revealed an over-representation of KLF transcription factor (TF) binding sites in gained enhancers, while lost enhancers contained more ETV/ETS motifs. We validated a subset of flow responsive enhancers using luciferase-based reporter constructs and CRISPR-Cas9 mediated genome editing. Lastly, we characterized shear stress responsive genes in ECs of zebrafish embryos using RNA-Seq. Together, our results reveal the presence of shear stress responsive DNA regulatory elements and lay the groundwork for the future exploration of these elements and the TFs binding to them in controlling EC biology.",

In the present work, we elucidate the role of disulfide (SS) bond in partitioning mechanism of membrane active Hepatitis A Virus-2B (HAV-2B) peptide, which harbours three cysteine residues promoting formation of multiple SS-bonded states. The inclusion of SS-bond not only results in a compact conformation but also induces distorted -helical hairpin geometry in comparison to SS-free state, resulting in reduced hydrophobic exposure. Owing to this, the partitioning of HAV-2B peptide is completely or partly abolished. In a way, the disulfide bond regulates the partitioning of HAV-2B peptide, such that the membrane remodelling effects of this viral peptide are significantly reduced. The current findings may have potential implications in drug designing, targeting the HAV-2B protein by promoting disulfide bond formation within its membrane active region.",

However, mechanisms underlying SP140-driven pathogenicity and therapeutic approaches that rescue SP140 remain unexplored. Using a global proteomic strategy, we identified SP140 as a repressor of topoisomerases (TOP) that maintains heterochromatin and immune cell fate. In humans and mice, SP140 loss resulted in unleashed TOP activity, genome instability, severely compromised lineage-defining and microbe-inducible innate transcriptional programs and defective bacterial killing. Pharmacological inhibition of TOP1 or TOP2 rescued these defects. Furthermore, exacerbated colitis was restored with TOP1 or TOP2 inhibitors in Sp140-/- mice, but not wild-type mice, in vivo.

    "abstract": "The intracellular pathogen Shigella flexneri, which is the causative agent of bacillary dysentery, significantly influences the worldwide implication of diarrheal infections, consequentially causing about 1.1 million deaths each year. Due to a non-availability of an authorized vaccine and the upsurge of multidrug resistance amongst Shigella strains, there has been a huge demand for further genetic analyses which could help in the advancement of new/improved drugs, and finding vaccine candidates against the pathogen. Whilst many features about the invasion of colonic cells by Shigella have been identified, fundamental gaps in information concerning in what way the bacteria transit, survive, and control gene expression, remain.

This system is involved in the regulation of cyclic-di-GMP levels inside the bacterial cells, which is a vital messenger molecule impacting varied cellular processes such as biofilm formation, cytotoxicity, motility, synthesis of exopolysaccharide, and other virulence mechanisms like adhesion and invasion of the bacteria. Through a combination of genetic, biochemical, and virulence assays, we show how knocking out the yfiB gene can disrupt the entire YfiBNR system and affect biofilm formation, bacterial invasion, host-surface attachment, and the overall virulence of Shigella. This study eventually improves our understanding of the in-vivo persistence and survival of Shigella, brings light to the c-di-GMP lead regulation of Shigella virulence, and provides a prospective new target to design anti-infective drugs and vaccines against S. flexneri and other bacterial pathogens.",
