    "abstract": "Rev is an essential regulatory protein of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV) that is found in the nucleus of infected cells. Rev multimerizes on the Rev-response element (RRE) of HIV RNA to facilitate the export of intron-containing HIV mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and, as such, HIV cannot replicate in the absence of Rev. We have developed cell-intact and cell-free assays based upon a robust firefly split-luciferase complementation system, both of which quantify Rev-Rev interaction. Using the cell-based system we show that additional Crm1 did not impact the interaction whereas excess Rev reduced it. Furthermore, when a series of mutant Revs were tested, there was a strong correlation between the results of the cell-based assay and the results of a functional Rev trans-complementation infectivity assay. Of interest, a camelid nanobody (NB) that was known to inhibit Rev function enhanced Rev-Rev interaction in the cell-based system. We observed a similar increase in Rev-Rev interaction in a cell-free system, when cell lysates expressing NLUC-Rev or CLUC-Rev were simply mixed. In the cell-free system Rev-Rev interaction occurred within minutes and was inhibited by excess Rev. The levels of interaction between the mutant Revs tested varied by mutant type. Treatment of Rev lysates with RNAse minimally reduced the degree of interaction whereas addition of HIV RRE RNA enhanced the interaction. Purified GST-Rev protein inhibited the interaction. The Z-factor (Z) for the cell-free system was ~0.85 when tested in 96-well format, and anti-Rev NB enhanced the interaction in the cell-free system. Thus, we have developed both cell-intact and cell-free systems that can reliably, rapidly, and reproducibly quantify Rev-Rev interaction. These assays, particularly the cell-free one, may be useful in screening and identifying compounds that inhibit Rev function on a high throughput basis.",

    "abstract": "Over 40% of individuals will develop osteoarthritis (OA) during their lifetime, yet there are currently no licensed disease modifying treatments for this disabling condition. Common polymorphic variants in ALDH1A2, that encodes the key enzyme in the synthesis of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), have been associated with severe hand OA. In this study, we sought to elucidate the biological significance of this association. We first confirmed that ALDH1A2 risk variants were associated with hand OA in UK Biobank. Articular cartilage was acquired from 33 consenting individuals with hand OA at the time of routine hand OA surgery. They were stratified by genotype and RNA sequencing performed. A reciprocal relationship between ALDH1A2 mRNA and inflammatory genes was observed. Articular cartilage injury up-regulates similar inflammatory genes by a process that we have previously termed mechanoflammation, and which we believe is a primary driver of OA. Cartilage injury was also associated with a concomitant drop in atRA-dependent genes, indicative of cellular atRA levels, and both responses to injury were reversed using talarozole, a retinoic acid metabolism blocking agent (RAMBA). Suppression of mechanoflammation by talarozole was mediated by a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-{gamma} dependent mechanism. Talarozole, delivered by minipump, was able to suppress mechano-inflammatory genes in articular cartilage in vivo 6h after mouse knee joint destabilization, and reduced cartilage degradation and osteophyte formation after 4 weeks. These data show that boosting atRA suppresses mechanoflammation in the articular cartilage in vitro and in vivo, and identifies RAMBAs as potential disease modifying drugs in OA.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryAnalysis of hand OA cartilage stratified by ALDH1A2 polymorphic variants reveals a targetable, anti-inflammatory role for retinoic acid in OA.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the ongoing global pandemic, must overcome a conundrum faced by all viruses. To achieve its own replication and spread, it simultaneously depends on and subverts cellular mechanisms. At the early stage of infection, SARS-CoV-2 expresses the viral nonstructural protein 1 (NSP1), which inhibits host translation by blocking the mRNA entry tunnel on the ribosome; this interferes with the binding of cellular mRNAs to the ribosome. Viral mRNAs, on the other hand, overcome this blockade. We show that NSP1 enhances expression of mRNAs containing the SARS-CoV-2 leader. The first stem-loop (SL1) in viral leader is both necessary and sufficient for this enhancement mechanism. Our analysis pinpoints specific residues within SL1 (three cytosine residues at the positions 15, 19 and 20) and another within NSP1 (R124) which are required for viral evasion, and thus might present promising drug targets. Additionally, we carried out analysis of a functional interactome of NSP1 using BioID and identified components of anti-viral defense pathways. Our analysis therefore suggests a mechanism by which NSP1 inhibits the expression of host genes while enhancing that of viral RNA. This analysis helps reconcile conflicting reports in the literature regarding the mechanisms by which the virus avoids NSP1 silencing.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic beta cell response to glucose is critical for the maintenance of normoglycemia. A strong transcriptional response was classically described in rodent models but, interestingly, not in human cells. In this study, we exposed human pancreatic beta cells to an increased concentration of glucose and analysed at a global level the mRNAs steady state levels and their translationalability. Polysome profiling analysis showed an early acute increase in protein synthesis and a specific translation regulation of more than 400 mRNAs, independently of their transcriptional regulation. We clustered the co-regulated mRNAs according to their behaviour in translation in response to glucose and discovered common structural and sequence mRNA features. Among them mTOR- and eIF2-sensitive elements have a predominant role to increase mostly the translation of mRNAs encoding for proteins of the translational machinery. Furthermore, we show that mTOR and eIF2 pathways are independently regulated in response to glucose, participating to a translational reshaping to adapt beta cell metabolism. The early acute increase in the translation machinery components prepare the beta cell for further protein demand due to glucose-mediated metabolism changes.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYAdaptation and response to glucose of pancreatic beta cells is critical for the maintenance of normoglycemia. Its deregulation is associated to Diabetic Mellitus (DM), a significant public health concern worldwide with an increased incidence of morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive research in rodent models, gene expression regulation in response to glucose remains largely unexplored in human cells. In our work, we have tackled this question by exposing human EndoC-BH1 cells to high glucose concentration. Using polysome profiling, the gold standard technique to analyse cellular translation activity, we observed a global protein synthesis increase, independent from transcription activity. Among the specific differentially translated mRNAs, we found transcripts coding for ribosomal proteins, allowing the cell machinery to be engaged in a metabolic response to glucose. Therefore, the regulation in response to glucose occurs mainly at the translational level in human cells, and not at the transcriptional level as described in the classically used rodent models.\n\nFurthermore, by comparing the features of the differentially translated mRNAs, and classifying them according to their translational response, we show that the early response to glucose occurs through the coupling of mRNA structure and sequence features impacting translation and regulation of specific signalling pathways. Collectively, our results support a new paradigm of gene expression regulation on the translation level in human beta cells.",

    "abstract": "Drought stress causes stomatal behavior change in most plants. Water deficit condition caused by drought is one of the most significant abiotic factors reducing plant growth, development, reproductive efficiency, and photosynthesis, resulting in yield loss. Maize (Zea mays L.) holds a superior position among all the cereals due to its versatile use in the food, feed, and alcohol industries. A common demonstrative feature of a complex network of signaling pathways led by predominantly abscisic acid under drought conditions is stomatal aperture reduction or stomatal closure, which allows the plant to reduce water loss through the stomatal pore and to sustain a long time on water deficit condition. This study analyses the stomatal density, stomatal closure percentages, and guard cell aperture reduction using a microscopy-based rapid & simple method to compare guard cell response & morphological variations of three hybrid maize varieties viz. BHM (BARI hybrid maize)-7, BHM-9, and BHM-13 developed by Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI). A drought treatment was applied to all varieties at two different vegetative stages, vegetative stage 3 (V3) and V5, until they reach V4 and V6, respectively. After drought exposure at the V4 stage, the percentage of closed stomata of BHM-7, BHM-9, and BHM-13 was 21%, 23%, and 33%, respectively. The reduction in the guard cell aperture ratio of BHM-7, BHM-9, and BHM-13 was 14.83%, 10.92%, and 33.85%, respectively. At the V6 stage, for the second set of plants, the closed stomata of BHM-7, BHM-9, and BHM-13 were 18%, 21%, and 34%, respectively. The rate of reduction in guard cell aperture ratio of BHM-7, BHM-9, and BHM-13 was 5.52%, 2.48%, and 38.75%, respectively. Therefore, BHM-13 showed maximum drought adaptation capacity compared to BHM-7 and BHM-9 due to the highest percentage of closed stomata and the highest percentage of reduction in aperture ratio.",

Dieback and basal stem necrosis have been observed in the plants since 2016, and its recent spread has significantly affected plant growth and nut production. Therefore, a survey was conducted to evaluate the disease incidence at five sites in Linan County, China. The highest incidence was recorded at the Tuankou site at up to 11.39% in 2019. The oomycete, Phytophthora cinnamomi, was isolated from symptomatic plant tissue and plantation soil using baiting and selective media-based detection methods and identified. Artificial infection with the representative P. cinnamomi ST402 isolate produced vertically elongated discolorations in the outer xylem and necrotic symptoms in C. cathayensis seedlings in a greenhouse trial. Molecular detections based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) specific to P. cinnamomi ST402 were conducted. Result indicated that LAMP detection showed a high coherence level with the baiting assays for P. cinnamomi detection in the field. This study provides the evidence of existence of high-pathogenic P. cinnamomi in the C. cathayensis plantation soil in China and the insights into a convenient tool developed for conducting field monitoring of this aggressive pathogen.",

Consequently, these have the potential to generate large footprints in the online and social media image records which may be valuable for ecological research. Cherry tree blooms are one such event, especially in Japan where they are a cultural symbol (Sakura, ). For centuries, the Japanese have celebrated Hanami (flower viewing) and the historical data record of the festival allows for phenological studies over this period, one application of which is climate reconstruction. Here we analyse Flickr social network site data in an analogous way to reveal the cherry blossoms seasonal sweep from southern to northern Japan over a twelve-week period.\n\nOur method analyses data filtered using geographical constraints, multi-stage text-tag classification, and machine vision, to assess image content for relevance to our research question and use it to estimate historic cherry bloom times. We validated our estimated bloom times against official data, demonstrating the accuracy of the approach. We also investigated an out of season Autumn blooming that has gained worldwide media attention. Despite the complexity of human photographic and social media activity and the relatively small scale of this event, our method can reveal that this bloom has in fact been occurring over a decade.\n\nThe approach we propose in our case study enables quick and effective monitoring of the photogenic spatiotemporal aspects of our rapidly changing world. It has the potential to be applied broadly to many ecological phenomena of widespread interest.",

    "abstract": "The eyes of insects display an incredible diversity of adaptations to enhance vision across the gamut of light levels that they experience. One commonly studied contrast is the difference in eye structure between nocturnal and diurnal species, with nocturnal species typically having features that enhance eye sensitivity such as larger eyes, larger eye facets, and larger ocelli. In this study, we compared eye structure between workers of closely related nocturnal and diurnal above ground foraging ant species (family Formicidae) in four genera (Myrmecocystus, Aphaenogaster, Temnothorax, Veromessor). In all four genera, nocturnal species tend to have little cuticular pigment (pale), while diurnal species are fully pigmented (dark), hence we could use cuticle coloration as a surrogate for activity pattern. Across three genera (Myrmecocystus, Aphaenogaster, Temnothorax), pale species, as expected for nocturnally active animals had larger eyes, larger facet diameters, and larger visual spans compared to their dark, more day active congeners. This same pattern occurred for one pale species of Veromessor, but not the other. There were no consistent differences between nocturnal and diurnal species in interommatidial angles and eye parameters both within and among genera. Hence, the evolution of eye features that enhance sensitivity in low light levels do not appear to have consistent correlated effects on features related to visual acuity. A survey across several additional ant genera found numerous other pale species with enlarged eyes, suggesting these traits evolved multiple times within and across genera. We also compared size of the anterior ocellus in workers of pale versus dark species of Myrmecocystus. In species with larger workers, the anterior ocellus was smaller in pale than in dark species, but this difference mostly disappeared for species with smaller workers. Presence of the anterior ocellus also was size-dependent in the two largest pale species.",

    "abstract": "Mislocalised membrane proteins (MLPs) present a risk to the cell due to exposed hydrophobic amino acids which cause MLPs to aggregate. Previous studies identified SGTA as a key component of the machinery that regulates the quality control of MLPs. Overexpression of SGTA promotes deubiqutination of MLPs resulting in their accumulation in cytosolic inclusions, suggesting SGTA acts in collaboration with deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) to exert these effects. However, the DUBs that play a role in this process have not been identified. In this study we have identified the ubiquitin specific peptidase 5 (USP5) as a DUB important in regulating the quality control of MLPs. We show that USP5 is in complex with SGTA, and this association is increased in the presence of an MLP. Overexpression of SGTA results in an increase in steady-state levels of MLPs suggesting a delay in proteasomal degradation of substrates. However, our results show that this effect is strongly dependent on the presence of USP5. We find that in the absence of USP5, the ability of SGTA to increase the steady state levels of MLPs is compromised. Moreover, knockdown of USP5 results in a reduction in the steady state levels of MLPs, while overexpression of USP5 increases the steady state levels. Our findings suggest that the interaction of SGTA with USP5 enables specific MLPs to escape proteasomal degradation allowing selective modulation of MLP quality control. These findings progress our understanding of aggregate formation, a hallmark in a range of neurodegenerative diseases and type II diabetes, as well as physiological processes of aggregate clearance.",
