    "abstract": "DNA base damage arises frequently in living cells and needs to be removed by base excision repair (BER) to prevent mutagenesis and genome instability. Both the formation and repair of base damage occur in chromatin and are conceivably affected by DNA-binding proteins such as transcription factors (TFs). However, to what extent TF binding affects base damage distribution and BER in cells is unclear. Here, we used a genome-wide damage mapping method, N-methylpurine-sequencing (NMP-seq), to characterize alkylation damage distribution and BER at TF binding sites in yeast cells treated with the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Our data shows that alkylation damage formation was mainly suppressed at the binding sites of yeast TFs Abf1 and Reb1, but individual hotspots with elevated damage levels were also found. Additionally, Abf1 and Reb1 binding strongly inhibits BER in vivo and in vitro, causing slow repair both within the core motif and its adjacent DNA. The observed effects are caused by the TF-DNA interaction, because damage formation and BER can be restored by depletion of Abf1 or Reb1 protein from the nucleus. Thus, our data reveal that TF binding significantly modulates alkylation base damage formation and inhibits repair by the BER pathway. The interplay between base damage formation and BER may play an important role in affecting mutation frequency in gene regulatory regions.",

    "abstract": "Epigenetic processes are proposed to contribute to phenotypic plasticity. In invertebrates, DNA methylation commonly varies across environments and can correlate or causally associate with phenotype, but its role in transcriptional responses to the environment remains unclear. Maternal environments experienced by the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus induce 3 - 6x greater differential CpG methylation in offspring larvae relative to larval developmental environments, suggesting a role for DNA methylation in transgenerational plasticity (TGP). However, a negligible association has been observed between differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes. What gene regulatory roles does invertebrate DNA methylation possess under environmental change, if any? We quantified DNA methylation and gene expression in S. purpuratus larvae exposed to different ecologically relevant conditions during gametogenesis (maternal conditioning) or embryogenesis (developmental conditioning). We modeled differential gene expression and differential splicing under maternal conditioning as functions of DNA methylation, incorporating variables for genomic feature and chromatin accessibility. We detected significant interactions between differential methylation, chromatin accessibility, and genic architecture associated with differential expression and splicing. Observed transcriptional responses to maternal conditioning were also 4 - 13x more likely when accounting for interactions between methylation and chromatin accessibility. Our results provide evidence that DNA methylation possesses multiple functional roles during TGP in S. purpuratus, but its effects are contingent upon other genomic and epigenomic states. Singularly unpredictive of transcription, DNA methylation is likely one cog in the epigenomic machinery contributing to environmental responses and phenotypic plasticity in S. purpuratus and other invertebrates.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPatients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high rates of sleep disruption beginning early in life, however the developmental consequences of this disruption are not understood. We examined sleep behavior and the consequences of sleep disruption in developing mice bearing C-terminal truncation mutation in the high-confidence ASD risk gene SHANK3 (Shank3{Delta}C). We hypothesized that sleep disruption may be an early sign of developmental divergence, and that clinically-relevant Shank3WT/{Delta}C mice may be at increased risk of lasting deleterious outcomes following early-life sleep disruption.\n\nMethodsWe recorded sleep behavior in developing Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C, Shank3WT/{Delta}C, and wild type siblings of both sexes using a non-invasive home cage monitoring system. Separately, litters of Shank3WT/{Delta}C and wildtype littermates were exposed to automated mechanical sleep disruption for 7 days prior to weaning (early-life sleep disruption: ELSD) or post-adolescence (PASD) or undisturbed control (CON) conditions. All groups underwent standard behavioral testing as adults.\n\nResultsMale and female Shank3{Delta}C/{Delta}C mice slept significantly less than wild type and Shank3WT/{Delta}C siblings shortly after weaning, with increasing sleep fragmentation in adolescence, indicating that sleep disruption has a developmental onset in this ASD model. ELSD treatment interacted with genetic vulnerability in Shank3WT/{Delta}Cmice, resulting in lasting, sex-specific changes in behavior, whereas wildtype siblings were largely resilient to these effects. Male ELSD Shank3WT/{Delta}Csubjects demonstrated significant changes in sociability, sensory processing, and locomotion, while female ELSD Shank3WT/{Delta}C subjects had a significant reduction in risk aversion. CON Shank3WT/{Delta}C mice, PASD mice, and all wildtype mice demonstrated typical behavioral responses in most tests.\n\nLimitationsThis study tested the interaction between developmental sleep disruption and genetic vulnerability using a single ASD mouse model: Shank3{Delta}C (deletion of exon 21). The broader implications of this work should be supported by additional studies using ASD model mice with distinct genetic vulnerabilities.\n\nConclusionOur study shows that sleep disruption during sensitive periods of early life interact with underlying genetic vulnerability to drive lasting and sex-specific changes in behavior. As individuals progress through maturation they gain resilience to the lasting effects of sleep disruption. This work highlights developmental sleep disruption as an important vulnerability in ASD susceptibility.",

    "abstract": "Many ants establish foraging routes through learning views of the visual panorama. Route models have focused primarily on attractive view use, which experienced foragers orient towards to return to known sites. However, aversive views have recently been uncovered as a key component of route learning. Here, Cataglyphis velox rapidly learned aversive views, when associated with a negative outcome, a period of captivity in brush, triggering an increase in hesitation behavior. These memories were based on the accumulation of experiences over multiple trips with each new experience regulating foragers hesitancy. Foragers were also sensitive to captivity time differences, suggesting they possess some mechanism to quantify duration. Finally, we analyzed foragers perception of risky (i.e. variable) versus stable aversive outcomes by associating two sites along the route with distinct captivity schedules, a fixed or variable duration, with the same mean across training. Foragers exhibited significantly less hesitation to the risky outcome compared to the fixed, indicating they perceived risky outcomes as less severe. Results align with a logarithmic relationship between captivity duration and hesitations, suggesting that aversive stimulus perception is a logarithm of its actual value. We conclude by characterizing how these behaviors can be executed within the mushroom bodies neural circuitry.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCentral serotonin is an essential neuromodulator for mental disorders. It appears a promising transdiagnostic marker of distinct psychiatric disorders and a common modulator of some of their key behavioral symptoms. We aimed to identify the behavioral markers of serotonergic function in rats and compare them to human deficits.\n\nMethodsWe applied a comprehensive profiling approach in adult male Tph2-/- rats constitutively lacking central serotonin. Under classical and ethological testing conditions, we tested each individuals cognitive, social and non-social abilities and characterized the group organization (i.e. social network, hierarchy). Using unsupervised machine learning, we identified the functions most dependent on central serotonin.\n\nResultsIn classical procedures, Tph2-/- rats presented an unexpected normal cognitive profile. Under the complex and experimenter-free conditions of their home-cage, the same Tph2-/- rats presented drastic changes in their daily life. Brain serotonin depletion induced compulsive aggression and sexual behavior, hyperactive and hypervigilant stereotyped behavior, reduced self-care and body weight, and exacerbated corticosterone levels. Group-housed Tph2-/- rats showed strong social disorganization with disrupted social networks and hierarchical structure, which may arise from communication deficits and cognitive blunting.\n\nConclusionsSerotonin depletion induced a profile reminiscent of the symptomatology of impulse control and anxiety disorders. Serotonin was necessary for behavioral adaptation to dynamic social environments. In classical testing conditions, our animal model challenged the concept of an essential role of serotonin in decision-making, flexibility, and impulsivity, although developmental compensations may have occurred. These contrasting findings highlight the need to generalize the evaluation of animal models multidimensional functions within the complexity of the social living environment.",

    "abstract": "Complete, reproducible extraction of protein material is essential for comprehensive and unbiased proteome analyses. A current gold standard is single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3), in which organic solvent and magnetic beads are used to denature and capture proteins, with subsequently washes allowing contaminant removal. However, SP3 is dependent on effective protein immobilisation onto beads, risks losses during wash steps, and experiences a drop-off in protein recovery at higher protein inputs. Magnetic beads may also contaminate samples and instruments, and become costly for larger scale protein preparations. Here, we propose solvent precipitation SP3 (SP4) as an alternative to SP3, omitting magnetic beads and employing brief centrifugation--either with or without low-cost inert glass beads--as the means of aggregated protein capture. SP4 recovered equivalent or greater protein yields for 1-5000 {micro}g preparations and improved reproducibility (median protein R2 0.99 (SP4) vs. 0.97 (SP3)). Deep proteome profiling (n = 9,076) also demonstrated improved recovery by SP4 and a significant enrichment of membrane and low-solubility proteins vs. SP3. The effectiveness of SP4 was verified in three other labs, each confirming equivalent or improved proteome characterisation over SP3. This work suggests that protein precipitation is the primary mechanism of SP3, and reliance on magnetic beads presents protein losses, especially at higher concentrations and amongst hydrophobic proteins. SP4 represents an efficient and effective alternative to SP3, provides the option to omit beads entirely, and offers virtually unlimited scalability of input and volume--all whilst retaining the speed and universality of SP3.\n\nBRIEFSolvent precipitation SP3 (SP4) captures aggregated protein for proteomics sample clean-up by omitting magnetic beads, instead employing brief centrifugation--with or without low-cost inert glass beads. SP4 offers improvements to protein yields, higher reproducibility, and greater recovery of membrane proteins, with verifications from three labs. Protein precipitation appears to be the primary mechanism of SP3, with reliance on magnetic beads presenting protein losses, especially at higher concentrations. SP4 presents an effective alternative to SP3 with improved scalability and equal speed and universality.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=135 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/461247v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (49K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ba615corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14df25dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@62f0c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ac436a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The emerging field of soft robotics aims to emulate dynamic physiological locomotion. Soft robotics mimicry of naturally complex biomechanics makes them ideal platforms for exerting mechanical stimuli for patient-specific tissue maturation and disease modeling applications. Such platforms are essential for emulating highly flexible tissues such as the kneecaps femoropopliteal artery (FPA), one of the most flexible arteries in the body, which flexes and bends during walking, standing, and crouching movements. The FPA is a frequent site of disease, where 80% of all peripheral artery diseases manifest, affecting over 200 million people worldwide. The complex biomechanical and hemodynamic forces within the FPA have been implicated in the frequent occurrence of PAD and lead to debilitating morbidities, such as limb-threatening ischemia. To better mimic these complex biomechanics, we developed an in-vitro bio-hybrid soft robot (BSR). First, Platsil OO-20 was identified as an ideal hyperelastomer for both cell culture and BSR fabrication using 3D printed molds. Then, employing a simulation-based design workflow, we integrated pneumatic network (PneuNet) actuators cast with Platsil OO-20, which extend in angular, longitudinal, and radial dimensions. Pressurizing the BSR PneuNets enabled a range of mechanical stimuli to be dynamically applied during tissue culture to mimic normal and diseased FPA flexions during daily walking and sitting poses, the most extreme being radial distensions of 20% and angular flexions of 140{degrees}. Finally, these designed, manufactured, and programmed vascular BSRs were seeded with mesenchymal stem cells and conditioned for 24 hours to highlight the effect of dynamic conditioning on cultured cell alignment, as well as type IV collagen production and the upregulation of smooth muscle phenotypes. Soft robotic bioreactor platforms that accurately mimic patient-, disease-, and lifestyle-specific mechanobiology will develop fundamental disease understanding, preoperative laboratory simulations for existing therapeutics, and biomanufacturing platforms for tissue-engineered implants.",

Strategies tailored for microbiome data are restricted to association testing, failing to allow other analytic goals such as visualization. We develop the Conditional Quantile Regression (ConQuR) approach to remove microbiome batch effects using a two-part quantile regression model. It is a fundamental advancement in the field because it is the first comprehensive method that accommodates the complex distributions of microbial read counts, and it generates batch-removed zero-inflated read counts that can be used in and benefit all usual subsequent analyses. We apply ConQuR to real microbiome data sets and demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance in removing batch effects while preserving or even amplifying the signals of interest.",

Following plate-wise normalization the values are counted within predetermined binning intervals, generating unique frequency distribution profiles (histograms) for each population, which are then normalized to control populations. Statistically significant differences are identified using a regression model approach. Significantly changed profiles can be used to generate a heatmap from which altered cell populations with similar phenotypes are identified, enabling detection of siRNAs and compounds with the same  on-target profile, reducing the number of false positive hits. A screen for cell cycle progression was used to validate the workflow, which identified statistically significant changes induced by siRNA-mediated gene perturbations and chemical inhibitors of different cell cycle stages.",

    "abstract": "Big Graph is a graph having thousands of vertices and hundreds of thousands of edges. The study of graphs is crucial because the interlinkage among the vertices provides various insights and uncovers the hidden truth developed due to their relationship. The graph processing has non-linear time complexity. The overwhelming number of vertices and edges of Big Graph further enhances the processing complexity by many folds. One of the significant challenges is searching for an edge in Big Graph. This article proposes a novel Bloom Filter to determine the existence of a relationship in Big Graph, specifically biological networks. In this article, we propose a novel Bloom Filter called Biological network Bloom Filter (BionetBF) for fast membership identification of the biological network edges or paired biological data. BionetBF is capable of executing millions of operations within a second while occupying a tiny main memory footprint. We have conducted rigorous experiments to prove the performance of BionetBF with large datasets. The experiment is performed using 12 synthetic datasets and three biological network datasets. It takes less than 8 sec for insertion and query of 40 million biological edges. It demonstrates higher performance while maintaining a 0.001 false positive probability. BionetBF is compared with other filters: Cuckoo Filter and Libbloom, where small-sized BionetBF proves its supremacy by exhibiting higher performance compared with large-sized Cuckoo Filter and Libbloom.

    "abstract": "Bounding box algorithms are useful in localization of image patterns. Recently, utilization of convolutional neural networks on X-ray images has proven a promising disease prediction technique. However, pattern localization over prediction has always been a challenging task with inconsistent coordinates, sizes, resolution and capture positions of an image. Several model architectures like Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), You only look once (YOLO), Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN), Region-based Fully Convolutional Networks (R-FCN), Single Shot Detector (SSD), etc. are used for object detection and localization in modern-day computer vision applications. SSD and region-based detectors like Fast R-CNN or Faster R-CNN are very similar in design and implementation, but SSD have shown to work efficiently with larger frames per second (FPS) and lower resolution images. In this article, we present a unique approach of SSD with a VGG-16 network as a backbone for feature detection of bounding box algorithm to predict the location of an anomaly within chest X-ray image.",

    "abstract": "Human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter ABCD1 transports CoA esters of saturated/monounsaturated very long chain fatty acid from cytosol to the peroxisome for {beta}-oxidation. Dysfunction of human ABCD1 usually causes the severe progressive genetic disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy, which eventually affects the adrenal glands and/or the central nervous system. Here, we report three cryo-EM structures of human ABCD1 in various states. The apo-form ABCD1 at 3.53 [A] resolution adopts an inward-facing conformation, harboring a phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) molecule at each lateral entry of substrate cavity. In the substrate-bound ABCD1 structure at 3.59 [A] resolution, two molecules of C22:0-CoA (one of the physiological substrates of ABCD1) is symmetrically bound to the transmembrane domains (TMDs). Each C22:0-CoA adopts an unpresented L-shape configuration: the CoA portion inserts into a polar pocket at the TMD at a pose parallel to the membrane plane, whereas the acyl chain portion perpendicular to membrane plane is embedded in a hydrophobic pocket at the opposite TMD. Upon binding the two C22:0-CoA molecules, which resemble a pair of hinges crossing the two TMDs, the two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) of ABCD1 approach towards each other. Addition ATP to the substrate-bound ABCD1 enabled us to reveal an ATP-bound structure at 2.79 [A], which shows an outward-facing conformation with the dimerized NBDs succeeding substrate release. These three structures combined with biochemical assays exhibit a snapshot of ABCD1-mediated substrate recognition, translocation and release. These findings provide the structural insights into the transport mechanism of ABC transporters that transport amphipathic molecules with long acyl chains.",

    "abstract": "Cancer associated fibroblasts (CAF) are a major cellular component of epithelial tumors. In breast cancers in particular these stromal cells have numerous tumorigenic effects in part due to their acquisition of a myofibroblastic phenotype. Breast CAFs (bCAFS) typically express MCL-1. We show here that targeting this regulator of mitochondrial integrity using a specific BH-3 mimetic promotes fragmentation of these organelles without inducing cell death. MCL-1 antagonism in primary bCAFs directly derived from human samples mitigates myofibroblastic features and decreases expression of genes involved in actomyosin organization and contractility, associated with a cytoplasmic retention of the transcriptional regulator, Yes-Associated Protein (YAP). Such treatment decreases bCAFs ability to promote cancer cells invasion in 3D co-culture assays. These effects are counteracted by an inhibitor of the mitochondrial fission protein DRP-1, which interacts with MCL-1 upon BH3 mimetic treatment. Our findings underscore the usefulness of targeting MCL-1 in breast cancer ecosystems, not only to favor death of cancer cells but also to counteract the tumorigenic activation of fibroblasts with which they co-evolve.\n\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.",

This study aimed to determine the frequency and characteristics of concurrent tau pathology in FTLD with TDP-43 pathology (FTLD-TDP).\n\nMethodsThe study included 146 autopsy-confirmed cases of FTLD-TDP and 55 cases of FTLD-TDP with motor neuron disease (FTLD-MND). Sections from the basal forebrain were screened for tau pathology with phospho-tau immunohistochemistry. For cases with tau pathology on the screening section, additional brain sections were studied to establish a diagnosis. Genetic analysis of C9ORF72, GRN, and MAPT was performed on select cases.\n\nResultsAmong 201 cases, we found 72 cases (36%) with primary age-related tauopathy (PART), 85 (42%) with aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG), 45 (22%) with argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), and 2 cases (1%) with corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Patients with ARTAG or AGD were significantly older than those without these comorbidities. One of the patients with FTLD-TDP and CBD had C9ORF72 mutation and relatively mild tau pathology, consistent with incidental CBD.\n\nConclusionThe coexistence of TDP-43 and tau pathologies was relatively common, particularly PART and ARTAG. Although rare, individual patients with FTLD can have multiple concurrent proteinopathies. The absence of TDP-43-positive astrocytic plaques may suggest that CBD and FTLD-TDP were independent disease processes in the two patients with both tau and TDP-43 pathologies. It remains to be determined if mixed cases represent a unique disease process or two concurrent disease processes in an individual.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThere is a growing desire for health professions educators to engage learners in more meaningful instruction. Many have tapped Wikipedia to offer an applied approach to engage learners, particularly as it relates to evidence-based medicine (EBM). However, little is known about the benefits and challenges of using Wikipedia as a pedagogical tool from the collective experience of educators who have sought to improve their instructional practice with it. This study aims to uncover and synthesize the perspectives of health professions education (HPE) instructors who have incorporated Wikipedia in their HPE courses.\n\nMethodsApplying a constructivist approach, the authors conducted semi-structured interviews with 17 participating HPE instructors who had substantively integrated Wikipedia into their curriculum. Participants were interviewed about their experiences of integrating Wikipedia editing into their courses. Thematic analysis was conducted on resulting transcripts.\n\nResultsAuthors observed two broad themes among participants expressed benefits of teaching with Wikipedia: 1) provides a meaningful instructional alternative that also benefits society and develops learners information literacy and EBM skills, and 2) supports learners careers and professional identity formation. Identified challenges included: 1) high effort and time, 2) issues with sourcing references, and 3) challenging interactions with skeptics, editors, and students.\n\nDiscussionFindings build on known benefits, such as providing a real-world collaborative project that contextualizes students learning experiences. They also echo known challenges, such as the resource-intensive nature of teaching with Wikipedia. At the same time, findings extend the current literature by revealing a potential opportunity to approach crowd-sourced information tools, like Wikipedia, as a vehicle to engage and enculturate HPE students within a situated learning context. These findings present implications for HPE programs considering implementing Wikipedia and faculty development needed to help instructors harness crowd-sourced information tools pedagogical opportunities as well as anticipate their challenges.",

    "abstract": "The primary somatosensory cortex (S1) is important for the control of movement as it encodes sensory input from the body periphery and external environment during ongoing movement. Mouse S1 consists of several distinct sensorimotor subnetworks that receive topographically organized cortico-cortical inputs from distant sensorimotor areas, including the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and primary motor cortex (M1). The role of the vibrissal S1 area and associated cortical connections during active sensing is well documented, but whether (and if so, how) non-whisker S1 areas are involved in movement control remains relatively unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that unilateral silencing of the non-whisker S1 area in both male and female mice disrupts hind paw movement during locomotion on a rotarod and a runway. S2 and M1 provide major long-range inputs to this S1 area. Silencing S2 [-&gt;] non-whisker S1 projections alters the hind paw orientation during locomotion while manipulation of the M1 projection has little effect. Using patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from male and female mice, we show that S2 projection preferentially innervates inhibitory interneuron subtypes. We conclude that interneuron-mediated S2-S1 cortico-cortical interactions are critical for efficient locomotion.\n\nSignificanceSomatosensory cortex participates in controlling rhythmic movements such as whisking and walking, but the neural circuitry underlying movement control by somatosensory cortex remains relatively unexplored. We uncover a cortico-cortical circuit in primary somatosensory cortex that regulates paw orientation during locomotion in mice. We identify neuronal elements that comprise these cortical pathways using pharmacology, behavioral assays and circuit-mapping methods.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects 6.2 million people age 65 and older in the U.S. alone, and is the leading cause of dementia. Moreover, AD can lead to visual impairment, and AD histopathology also manifests in the retina. However, the factors that modulate AD pathophysiology and lead to varied susceptibility and presentation in the population are not well understood. In this context, traumatic brain injury (TBI), which can arise from sport concussions, military combat, and other causes, is associated with a 2.3-fold higher risk of developing AD and AD-related dementias (ADRD). Thus, we set out to evaluate the effects of TBI, AD, and their combination, on retinal histopathology.\n\nSeveral animal models have been developed to investigate the mechanisms underlying AD, but many have been limited by imperfect recapitulation of human pathology, and no model of TBI-associated AD (AD-TBI) has been characterized. To address this gap, we generated an innovative model of AD-TBI by taking advantage of a transgenic rat model (Tg-F344-AD) shown to recapitulate the main features of human AD pathology, and combining it with a twotime unilateral controlled cortical impact paradigm to mimic repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI). Histopathological analyses at four months post-impact confirm the presence of AD markers in transgenic retinas, and an increased severity of AD pathology due to TBI. Together, these results contribute to our understanding of the effects of TBI on AD retinopathy, with implications for patient care and therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "Characterization of the interwoven complexities of early cortical thickness development has been an ongoing undertaking in neuroscience research. Longitudinal studies of Non-Human Primates (NHP) offer unique advantages to categorizing the diverse patterns of cortical growth trajectories. Here, we used latent growth models to characterize the trajectories of typical cortical thickness development in Japanese macaques at each cortical surface vertex (i.e. grayordinate). Cortical thickness from 4 to 36 months showed regional specific linear and non-linear trajectories and distinct maturation timing across the cortex. Intriguingly, we revealed a \"accumulation/ablation phenomenon\" of cortical maturation where the most profound development changes in cortical thickness occur in the accumulation or ablation zones surrounding the focal points (i.e., a center of a delineated regions where cortical thickness is thickest or thinnest) throughout the brain. We further examined maternal diet and inflammation in the context of these typical brain trajectories and known network architecture. A well-controlled NHP model of a maternal \"Western-style\" diet was used alongside measures of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the mothers during gestation. We observed that these accumulation and ablation zones of variable change might be most susceptible to environmental effects. The maternal factors, diet and inflammation during pregnancy were distinctively associated with different aspects of offspring cortical development reflected in regions related to distinctive functional networks. Our findings characterize the versatile intricacies of typical cortical thickness development and highlight how the maternal environment plays a role in offspring cortical development.",

    "abstract": "AbstractIn an effort to reduce reliance on opioids for the treatment of pain in the clinic, ongoing work is testing the utility of cannabinoid drugs as a potential alternative for treatment of chronic pain. We tested chronic THC vapor inhalation effects on thermal nociception and mechanical sensitivity, as well as midbrain (i.e., ventrolateral periaqueductal gray [vlPAG]) neuronal function, in adult male and female Wistar rats with chronic inflammatory pain (CFA treatment). We report that chronic THC vapor inhalation rescues both thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical hypersensitivity in males treated with CFA, but only thermal hyperalgesia in CFA females. Most of the anti-hyperalgesic effects of chronic THC vapor were still observable 24 hours after cessation of the last THC exposure. We also report that chronic THC vapor inhalation modulates intrinsic and synaptic properties of vlPAG neurons, including reductions in action potential firing rate and spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission in males, and that these effects occur specifically in neurons that respond to current input with a \"delayed\" firing phenotype. Treatment with CFA led to increased firing rate and increased sIPSC amplitude in vlPAG neurons of female rats, and chronic THC vapor rescued sIPSC amplitudes to control levels - these effects were specific to vlPAG neurons categorized as having an \"onset\" firing phenotype. Ongoing work is exploring sex-specific mechanisms (e.g., CB1 receptor) of THC vapor rescue effects in the vlPAG of rats treated with CFA, and further exploring the vlPAG cell types impacted by CFA treatment and chronic THC vapor inhalation.\n\nSignificance StatementMany adults in the U.S. with pain self-medicate with THC and cannabis, and many humans use e-cigarette type devices filled with cannabis extracts to self-administer THC and other constituents of the marijuana plant. Until recently, most rodent studies of THC effects on brain and behavior have used injection procedures and male rats. Here, we tested the effect of chronic THC vapor inhalation on pain-related behaviors and midbrain neural circuit function in adult male and female Wistar rats. As predicted, chronic THC vapor inhalation rescued chronic inflammatory pain effects on behavior and midbrain neuronal function.",

    "abstract": "Whereas progress has been made in identifying neural signals related to rapid, cued decisions1-4, less is known about how brains guide and terminate more ethologically relevant deliberations, where an animals own behavior governs the options experienced over minutes5-8. Drosophila search for many seconds to minutes for egg-laying sites with high relative value9, 10 and neurons, called oviDNs, exist whose activity fulfills necessity and sufficiency criteria for initiating the egg-deposition motor program11. Here we show that oviDNs express a calcium signal that rises over seconds to minutes as a fly deliberates whether to lay an egg. The calcium signal dips when an egg is internally prepared (ovulated), rises at a rate related to the relative value of the current substrate being experienced, and reaches a consistent peak just prior to the abdomen bend for egg deposition. We provide perturbational evidence that the egg-deposition motor program is initiated once this signal hits a threshold and that sub-threshold variation in the signal regulates the time spent deliberating and, ultimately, the option chosen. These results argue that a rise-to-threshold signal guides Drosophila to lay eggs on substrate options with high relative value, with each egg-laying event representing a self-paced decision similar to real-world decisions made by humans and other mammals.",

    "abstract": "Inference in neuroimaging commonly occurs at the level of \"clusters\" of neighboring voxels or connections, thought to reflect functionally specific brain areas. Yet increasingly large studies reveal effects that are shared throughout the brain, suggesting that reported clusters may only reflect the \"tip of the iceberg\" of underlying effects. Here, we empirically compare power of traditional levels of inference (edge and cluster) with broader levels of inference (network and whole-brain) by resampling functional connectivity data from the Human Connectome Project (n=40, 80, 120). Only network- and whole brain-level inference attained or surpassed \"adequate\" power ({beta}=80%) to detect an average effect, with almost double the power for network-compared with cluster-level procedures at more typical sample sizes. Likewise, effects tended to be widespread, and more widespread pooling resulted in stronger magnitude effects. Power also substantially increased when controlling FDR rather than FWER. Importantly, there may be similar implications for task-based activation analyses where effects are also increasingly understood to be widespread. However, increased power with broader levels of inference may diminish the specificity to localize effects, especially for non-task contexts. These findings underscore the benefit of shifting the scale of inference to better capture the underlying signal, which may unlock opportunities for discovery in human neuroimaging.",

    "abstract": "Advances in behavioral optogenetics are limited by the absence of high-throughput pipelines for the automated analysis of behavior in freely behaving animals. Although a variety of AI algorithms has been proposed that enable automation of behavioral analysis, existing methods are generally low-throughput. In addition, optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits typically requires physical tethers to light sources, which limits the number of brain areas that can be targeted and thus constrains behavioral testing. Here, we develop a new wireless platform that combines a battery-free dual-channel optogenetic implant with an AI algorithm for high-throughput behavioral analysis. In our platform, a customized AI algorithm detected and quantified freezing behavior of rats that had undergone fear conditioning. Notably, our platform allows up to four enclosures to be monitored simultaneously. Wireless dual-channel optogenetic devices were implanted in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) to permit independent modulation of BLA principal neurons (red light, AAV-CaMKII-JAWS) or BLA interneurons (blue light, AAV-mDlx-ChR2) in freely behaving animals. In vivo validation with behaving rats demonstrates the utility of the telemetry system for large-scale optogenetic studies.\n\nSignificanceAI algorithms can enable automation of behavioral analysis and thereby facilitate the progress on behavioral optogenetics. Successful integration of advanced wireless dual-channel optoelectronic devices with biological systems can also yield new tools and techniques for neuroscience research, particularly in the context of techniques for optogenetics. Here, we propose a new approach that combines an advanced AI algorithm with a low power wireless telemetry system, yielding powerful capabilities in the understanding of brain functions and the evaluation of the behavioral consequences of neural circuit manipulations. In vivo studies using optimized systems demonstrate high-throughput automation of behavioral manipulation and analysis via AI-powered wireless telemetry.",

    "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common and progressive disorder in the elderly that interferes with daily activities and increases the risk of injury. It is of importance to find efficient treatments to treat or delay this age-related neurodegeneration. We previously demonstrated that activation of the cholesterol sensor Liver X receptor (LXR) with the potent agonist GW3965, alleviates pain in a diet-induced obesity model. Because cholesterol had also been linked to neuropathy during aging, we sought to test whether LXR activation may improve neuropathy and pain in aged mice by treating 21-month-old mice for 3 months with GW3965. Treatment resulted in a significant increase in nerve fibers of the sub-basal plexus, accompanied by a change in polarization, metabolism, and cholesterol content of macrophages in the sciatic nerve. These results suggest that activation of the LXR may block the progression of neuropathy associated with aging by modifying nerve-immune cell cholesterol, thereby providing new pathways to target in efforts to delay neuropathy during aging.",

    "abstract": "Developmental delays in infanthood often persist, turning into life-long difficulties, and coming at great cost for the individual and community. By examining the developing brain and its relation to developmental outcomes we can start to elucidate how the emergence of brain circuits is manifested in variability of infant motor, cognitive and behavioural capacities. In this study, we examined if cortical structural covariance at birth, indexing coordinated development, is related to later infant behaviour. We included 193 healthy term-born infants from the Developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP). An individual cortical connectivity matrix derived from morphological and microstructural features was computed for each subject (morphometric similarity networks, MSNs) and was used as input for the prediction of behavioural scores at 18 months using Connectome-Based Predictive Modeling (CPM). Neonatal MSNs successfully predicted social-emotional performance. Predictive edges were distributed between and within known functional cortical divisions with a specific important role for primary and posterior cortical regions. These results reveal that multi-modal neonatal cortical profiles showing coordinated maturation are related to developmental outcomes and that network organization at birth provides an early infrastructure for future functional skills.",

    "abstract": "Despite decades of research, there is still a lack of understanding of the role and generating mechanisms of the ubiquitous fluctuations and oscillations found in recordings of brain dynamics. Here, we used a strength-dependent perturbative framework to provide a causal mechanistic description of how human brain function is perched at the delicate balance between fluctuation and oscillation. Applying local strength-dependent perturbations and subsequently measuring the perturbative complexity index clearly demonstrates that the overall balance of brain dynamics is shifted towards fluctuations for providing much needed flexibility. Importantly, stimulation in the fluctuation regime modulates specific resting state network, thus providing a mechanistic explanation of experimentally reported brain dynamics. Furthermore, this framework generates specific, testable empirical predictions for human stimulation studies using strength-dependent rather than constant perturbation. Overall, the strength-dependent perturbative framework demonstrates how the human brain is poised on the edge of criticality, between fluctuations to oscillations, allowing for maximal flexibility.",

    "abstract": "Abnormal NMDAr function has been linked to rhythmopathies, psychosis, and cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia (SCZ). Here, we investigate the role of NMDAr hypofunction in pathological oscillations and behavior. We implanted mice with tetrodes in the dorsal hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), administered the NMDAr antagonist MK801, and recorded oscillations during spontaneous exploration in an open field and in the y-maze spatial working memory test. Our results show that NMDAr blockade increased locomotor activity, impaired spatial working memory, and disrupted the correlation between oscillations and speed of movement, which is crucial for internal representations of distance. In the hippocampus, MK801 increased gamma oscillations and disrupted theta/gamma coupling. In the mPFC, MK801 increased the power of theta and gamma, generated high-frequency oscillations (HFO 155-185 Hz), and disrupted theta/gamma coupling. The performance of mice in the spatial working memory version of the y-maze was strongly correlated with CA1-PFC theta/ low gamma co-modulation. Thus, theta/gamma mediated by NMDAr function might be essential to explaining several of SCZs cognitive symptoms and might be crucial to explaining hippocampal-PFC interaction.\n\nSignificance StatementNMDAr hypofunction might be the basis of cognitive symptoms and oscillopathies found in SCZ. In this work, we aimed to understand this link further. We found that NMDAr hypofunction altered theta/gamma co-modulation in the hippocampus and the PFC, explaining spatial working memory deficits.",

    "abstract": "Rapidly growing evidence demonstrates that flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through perivascular spaces (PVSs) - annular channels surrounding vasculature in the brain - is a critically-important component of neurophysiology. CSF inflow contributes during physiological conditions to clearance of metabolic waste and in pathological situations to edema formation. However, brain-wide imaging methods cannot resolve PVSs, and high-resolution methods cannot access deep tissue or be applied to human subjects, so theoretical models provide essential insight. We model this CSF pathway as a network of hydraulic resistances, built from published parameters. A few parameters have very wide uncertainties, so we focus on the estimated limits of their feasible ranges by analyzing different parametric scenarios. We identify low-resistance PVSs and high-resistance parenchyma (brain tissue) as the scenario that best explains experimental observations. Our results point to the most important parameters that should be measured in future experiments. Extensions of our modeling may help predict stroke severity or lead to neurological disease treatments and drug delivery methods.",

The modulation of brain state changes can arise from the lateral hypothalamus (LH), where diverse neuronal cell types contribute to arousal regulation in opposite directions via the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the relationship of the LH and pupil dynamics has seldom been investigated. Here, we performed local field potential (LFP) recordings at the LH and ACC, and the whole brain fMRI with simultaneous fiber photometry Ca2+ recording in the ACC, to evaluate their correlation with brain state-dependent pupil dynamics. Both LFP and functional MRI (fMRI) data showed opposite correlation features to pupil dynamics, demonstrating an LH activity-dependent manner. Our results demonstrate that the correlation of pupil dynamics with ACC LFP and whole-brain fMRI signals depends on LH activity, indicating a role of the latter in brain state regulation.",

    "abstract": "Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by nerve tumors called neurofibromas, in which Schwann cells (SCs) lack NF1 and show deregulated RAS signaling. NF1 is also implicated in regulation of cAMP. Gene expression profiling and protein expression identified P2RY14 in SCs and SC precursors (SCPs) implicating P2RY14 as a candidate upstream regulator of cAMP in EGF-dependent SCP. We found that SCP self-renewal was reduced by genetic or pharmacological inhibition of P2RY14. In NF1 deficient SCs and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) cells, P2RY14 inhibition decreased EGFR-driven phospho-Akt and increased cAMP signaling. In a neurofibroma mouse model, genetic deletion of P2RY14 increased mouse survival, delayed neurofibroma initiation and rescued cAMP signaling. Conversely, elevation of cAMP diminished SCP number in vitro and diminished SC proliferation in neurofibroma bearing mice in vivo. These studies identify the purinergic receptor P2RY14 as a critical G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) in NF1 mutant SCPs and SCs and suggest roles for EGFR-GPCR crosstalk in facilitating SCP self-renewal and neurofibroma initiation via cAMP and EGFR-driven phospho-Akt.",

    "abstract": "France displays a latitudinal range for the expansion of Aedes albopictus invasive populations that is not yet completely colonized providing a critical opportunity to address key invasion processes. We propose a spatio-temporal model (DISTIGRI) to describe and predict current and future expansion at both intra- and inter-annual scales of A. albopictus. This process-based model integrates mechanistic descriptions of the developmental cycle and the dispersal process of A. albopictus within a reaction-diffusion framework, depending on climatic suitability and photoperiod with a high spatio-temporal resolution. Using this model coupled with a climatic database, we propose several maps describing the current intra-annual distribution of A. albopictus, including the date of first emergence and the length of the period with significant adult presence. We also compute its future distribution over the next 10 years under several climatic scenarios, which shows a range expansion with a strong dependence on the climatic scenario. The outputs of the model may constitute a valuable asset for designing control and avoidance strategies, and to anticipate the biting nuisance with a high spatio-temporal resolution. These outputs also emphasize the importance of taking both dispersal and life cycle into account to obtain accurate descriptions of out-of-equilibrium processes such as ongoing invasions.",

    "abstract": "Stromal interaction molecules, STIM1 and STIM2, sense decreases in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [Ca2+] ([Ca2+]ER) and cluster in ER-plasma membrane (ER-PM) junctions where they recruit and activate Orai1. While STIM1 responds when [Ca2+]ER is relatively low, STIM2 displays constitutive clustering in the junctions and is suggested to regulate basal Ca2+ entry. The cellular cues that determine STIM2 clustering under basal conditions is not known. By using gene editing to fluorescently tag endogenous STIM2, we report that endogenous STIM2 is constitutively localized in mobile and immobile clusters. The latter associate with ER-PM junctions and recruit Orai1 under basal conditions. Agonist stimulation increases immobile STIM2 clusters which co- ordinate recruitment of Orai1 and STIM1 to the junctions. Extended synaptotagmin (E-Syt)2/3 are required for forming the ER-PM junctions, but are not sufficient for STIM2 clustering. Importantly, inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP3R) function and local [Ca2+]ER are the main drivers of immobile STIM2 clusters. Enhancing, or decreasing, IP3R function at ambient [IP3] causes corresponding increase, or attenuation, of immobile STIM2 clusters. We show that immobile STIM2 clusters denote decreases in local [Ca2+]ER mediated by IP3R that is sensed by the STIM2-N terminus. Finally, under basal conditions, ambient PIP2-PLC activity of the cell determines IP3R function, immobilization of STIM2, and basal Ca2+ entry while agonist stimulation augments these processes. Together, our findings reveal that immobilization of STIM2 clusters within ER-PM junctions, a first response to ER-Ca2+ store depletion, is facilitated by the juxtaposition of IP3R and marks a checkpoint for initiation of Ca2+ entry.\n\nSignificanceSTIM proteins sense decreases in [Ca2+]ER and cluster in endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-plasma membrane (PM) junctions where they recruit and activate Orai1. While STIM1 clustering requires substantial [Ca2+]ER decrease, STIM2 displays pre-clustering under resting conditions and regulates basal Ca2+ entry. The mechanism(s) underlying constitutive clustering of STIM2 is not known. We show herein that endogenous STIM2 assembles as mobile and immobile clusters and that Orai1 is recruited to the latter. Anchoring of STIM2 clusters is triggered by decreases in local [Ca2+]ER that is mediated by ambient activity of IP3R and sensed by the STIM2 N-terminus. This functional link between IP3R and STIM2 governs constitutive STIM2 clustering and ensures coupling of [Ca2+]ER decrease at sub-threshold stimuli with activation of Ca2+ entry.",

    "abstract": "We investigate the disynaptic effect of the hilar cells on pattern separation in a spiking neural network of the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). The principal granule cells (GCs) in the DG perform pattern separation, transforming similar input patterns into less-similar output patterns. In our DG network, the hilus consists of excitatory mossy cells (MCs) and inhibitory HIPP (hilar perforant path-associated) cells. Here, we consider the disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells on the GCs, mediated by the inhibitory basket cells (BCs) in the granular layer; MC [-&gt;] BC [-&gt;] GC and HIPP [-&gt;] BC [-&gt;] GC. Disynaptic inhibition from the MCs tends to decrease the firing activity of the GCs. On the other hand, the HIPP cells disinhibit the intermediate BCs, which leads to increasing the activity of the GCs. By changing the synaptic strength K(BC,X) [from the presynaptic X (= MC or HIPP) to the postsynaptic BC] from the default value K(BC,X)*, we study the change in the pattern separation degree [S]d. When decreasing K(BC,MC) or independently increasing K(BC,HIPP) from their default values, [S]d is found to decrease (i.e., pattern separation is reduced). On the other hand, as K(BC,MC) is increased or independently K(BC,HIPP) is decreased from their default values, pattern separation becomes enhanced (i.e., [S]d increases). In this way, the disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells on the pattern separation are opposite ones. Thus, when simultaneously varying both K(BC,MC) and K(BC,HIPP), as a result of balance between the two competing disynaptic effects of the MCs and the HIPP cells, [S]d forms a bell-shaped curve with an optimal maximum at their default values. Moreover, we also investigate population and individual behaviors of the sparsely synchronized rhythm of the GCs, and find that the amplitude measure [M]a (representing population synchronization degree) and the random-phase-locking degree [L]d (denoting individual activity degree) are strongly correlated with the pattern separation degree [S]d. Consequently, the larger the synchronization and the random phase-locking degrees of the sparsely synchronized rhythm is, the more the pattern separation becomes enhanced.",

    "abstract": "Humans constantly move their eyes to explore the environment and obtain information. Competing theories of gaze guidance consider the factors driving eye movements within a dichotomy between low-level visual features and high-level object representations. However, recent developments in object perception indicate a complex and intricate relationship between features and objects. Specifically, image-independent object-knowledge can generate objecthood by dynamically reconfiguring how feature space is carved up by the visual system. Here, we adopt this emerging perspective of object perception, moving away from the simplifying dichotomy between features and objects in explanations of gaze guidance. We recorded eye movements in response to stimuli that appear as meaningless patches on initial viewing but are experienced as coherent objects once relevant object-knowledge has been acquired. We demonstrate that gaze guidance differs substantially depending on whether observers experienced the same stimuli as meaningless patches or organized them into object representations. In particular, fixations on identical images became object-centred, less dispersed, and more consistent across observers once exposed to relevant prior object-knowledge. Observers gaze behaviour also indicated a shift from exploratory information-sampling to a strategy of extracting information mainly from selected, object-related image areas. These effects were evident from the first fixations on the image. Importantly, however, eye-movements were not fully determined by object representations but were best explained by a simple model that integrates image-computable features and high-level, knowledge-dependent object representations. Overall, the results show how information sampling via eye-movements in humans is guided by a dynamic interaction between image-computable features and knowledge-driven perceptual organization.",

    "abstract": "Activation of endogenous neural stem cells (NSCs) is critically important for the adult neurogenesis. However, NSC activation is extremely limited after spinal cord injury (SCI). Recent evidence suggests that accumulation of protein aggregates impedes quiescent NSC activation. Here, we found ubiquitin c-terminal hydrolase l-1 (UCHL1), an important deubiquitinating enzyme, functioned to facilitate NSC activation by clearing protein aggregations through ubiquitin-proteasome approach. Upregulation of UCHL1 enhanced NSC proliferation in the spinal cord after injury. Based on protein microarray analysis of SCI cerebrospinal fluid, it is further revealed that C3+ neurotoxic reactive astrocytes negatively regulated UCHL1 and aggresome clearance through C3/C3aR signaling, resulting in reduced capacity of NSC to activate. Furthermore, blockade of reactive astrocytes or C3/C3aR pathway led to enhanced NSC activation post-SCI. Together, this study elucidated a mechanism regulating NSC activation in the adult spinal cord involving the UCHL1-proteasome approach, which may provide potential molecular targets for NSC fate regulation.",

    "abstract": "Power modulations in alpha oscillations (8-14Hz) have been associated with most human cognitive functions and psychopathological conditions studied. These reports are often inconsistent with the prevailing view of a specific relationship of alpha oscillations to attention and working memory (WM). We propose that conceptualizing the role of alpha oscillations in oculomotor control resolves this inconsistency. This proposition is based on a review of results across species (human Npooled=295, one non-human primate, honey bee N=5), experimental conditions (rest, attention, and working memory), and recording techniques (EEG, ECOG, eye-tracking, and MEG) that encourage the following relationships between alpha oscillations and eye-movement control: (i) saccade initiation prompts power decrease in brain circuits associated with saccadic control; (ii) the direction of a saccade is consistent with alpha lateralization, both during task and resting conditions; (iii) the phase of alpha activity informs saccade occurrence and biases miniature eye movements during fixation (e.g. fixational tremor); and (iv) oculomotor action differentiates WM load. A new theory on how alpha oscillations link oculomotor action to cognition is proposed. Generalizing across tasks and species: low oculomotor activity is associated with high alpha power and vice versa. Alpha oscillations regulate how long to look at a given target and how fast to saccade to a next. By ensuring steady gaze position, any potential input outside foveal vision is \"suppressed\".",

    "abstract": "GNAO1 encodes Go, a heterotrimeric G protein alpha subunit in the Gi/o family. In this report, we used a Gnao1 mouse model \"G203R\" previously described as a \"gain-of-function\" Gnao1 mutant with movement abnormalities and enhanced seizure susceptibility. Here, we report an unexpected second mutation resulting in a loss-of-function Go protein and describe alterations in central synaptic transmission.\n\nWhole cell patch clamp recordings from Purkinje cells (PCs) in acute cerebellar slices from Gnao1 mutant mice showed significantly lower frequencies of spontaneous and miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs and mIPSCs) compared to WT mice. There was no significant change in sEPSCs or mEPSCs. Whereas mIPSC frequency was reduced, mIPSC amplitudes were not affected, suggesting a presynaptic mechanism of action. A modest decrease in the number of molecular layer interneurons was insufficient to explain the magnitude of IPSC suppression. Paradoxically, Gi/o inhibitors (pertussis toxin), enhanced the mutant-suppressed mIPSC frequency and eliminated the difference between WT and Gnao1 mice. While GABAB receptor regulates mIPSCs, neither agonists nor antagonists of this receptor altered function in the mutant mouse PCs. This study is the first electrophysiological investigation of the role of Gi/o protein in cerebellar synaptic transmission using an animal model with a loss-of-function Gi/o protein.\n\nSignificance StatementThis is the first report on the electrophysiological mechanisms of a movement disorder animal model with monoallelic Gnao1 loss. This study illustrates the role of Go protein in regulating GABA release in mouse cerebellum. This study could also facilitate the discovery of new drugs or drug repurposing for GNAO1-associated disorders. Moreover, since GNAO1 shares pathways with other genes related to movement disorders, developing drugs for the treatment of GNAO1-associated movement disorders could further the pharmacological intervention for other monogenic movement disorders.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo estimate dynamic off-resonance due to vigorous body motion in accelerated fMRI of awake behaving non-human primates (NHPs) using the standard EPI 3-line navigator, in order to attenuate the effects of time-varying off-resonance on the reconstruction.\n\nMethodsIn NHP fMRI the animals head is usually head-posted, and the dynamic off-resonance is mainly caused by motion in body parts that are distant from the brain and have low spatial frequency. Hence, off-resonance at each frame can be approximated as a spatially linear perturbation of the off-resonance at a reference frame, and is manifested as a relative linear shift in k-space. Using GRAPPA operators, we estimated these shifts by comparing the 3-line navigator at each time frame with that at the reference frame. Estimated shifts were then used to correct the data at each frame. The proposed method was evaluated in phantom scans, simulations, and in vivo data.\n\nResultsThe proposed method is shown to successfully estimate low-spatial order dynamic off-resonance perturbations, including induced linear off-resonance perturbations in phantoms, and is able to correct retrospectively corrupted data in simulations. Finally, it is shown to reduce ghosting artifacts and geometric distortions by up to 20% in simultaneous multi-slice in vivo acquisitions in awake-behaving NHPs.\n\nConclusionA method is proposed that does not need any sequence modification or extra acquisitions and makes accelerated awake behaving NHP imaging more robust and reliable, reducing the gap between what is possible with NHP protocols and state-of-the-art human imaging.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound neuromodulation (UNM), where a region in the brain is targeted by focused ultrasound (FUS), which, in turn, causes excitation or inhibition of neural activity, has recently received considerable attention as a promising tool for neuroscience. Despite its great potential, several aspects of UNM are still unknown. An important question pertains to the off-target sensory effects of UNM and their dependence on stimulation frequency. To understand these effects, we have developed a finite-element model of a mouse, including elasticity and viscoelasticity, and used it to interrogate the response of mouse models to focused ultrasound (FUS). We find that, while some degree of focusing and magnification of the signal is achieved within the brain, the induced pressure-wave pattern is complex and delocalized. In addition, we find that the brain is largely insulated, or  cloaked, from shear waves by the cranium and that the shear waves are largely carried away from the skull by the vertebral column, which acts as a waveguide. We find that, as expected, this waveguide mechanism is strongly frequency dependent, which may contribute to the frequency dependence of UNM effects. Our calculations further suggest that off-target skin locations experience displacements and stresses at levels that, while greatly attenuated from the source, could nevertheless induce sensory responses in the subject.",

    "abstract": "Alzheimers disease is pathologically featured by abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta plaque, neurofibrillary tangles, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration. Metal dysregulation including excessive zinc released by presynaptic neurons plays an important role in tau pathology and oxidase activation. The activities of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) are elevated in the brains of patients with Alzheimers disease. Zinc induces tau hyperphosphorylation via mTOR/P70S6K activation in vitro. However, the involvement of mTOR/P70S6K pathway in zinc-induced oxidative stress, tau degeneration, synaptic and cognitive impairment, has not been fully elucidated in vivo. Here we assessed in the effect of pathological concentration of zinc in SH-SY5Y cells by using biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. Rats (n = 18, male) were lateral ventricularly-injected with zinc and treated with rapamycin (intraperitoneal injection) for one week and assessed using Morris water maze. Evaluation of the oxidative stress, tau phorsphylation and synaptic impairment were performed using the hippocampus tissue of the rats by biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. Results from Morris water maze showed that the capacity of spatial memory is impaired in zinc-treated rats. Zinc sulfate significantly increased the levels of P-mTOR Ser2448, P-p70S6K Thr389, and P-tau Ser356, and decreased levels of Nrf2 and HO{square}1 in SH-SY5Y cells and in zinc-treated rats compared with control groups. Increased expressions of reactive oxygen species were observed in zinc sulfate-induced SH-SY5Y cells as well as in the hippocampus of zinc-injected rats. Rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR, rescued the zinc-induced increases in mTOR/p70S6K activations, tau phosphorylation and oxidative stress, as well as Nrf2/HO{square}1 inactivation, cognitive impairment and synaptic impairment reduced the expression of synapse-related proteins in zinc-injected rats. In conclusion, our findings imply that rapamycin prevents zinc-induced cognitive impairment and protects neurons from tau pathology, oxidative stress and synaptic impairment, by decreasing mTOR/p70S6K hyperactivity and increasing Nrf2/HO {square} 1 activity.",

    "abstract": "When monkeys learn to group visual stimuli into arbitrary categories, lateral intraparietal area (LIP) neurons become category-selective. Surprisingly, the representations of learned categories are overwhelmingly biased: nearly all LIP neurons in a given animal prefer the same category over other behaviorally equivalent categories. We propose a model where such biased representations develop through the interplay between Hebbian plasticity and the recurrent connectivity of LIP. In this model, two separable processes of positive feedback unfold in parallel: in one, category selectivity emerges from competition between prefrontal inputs; in the other, bias develops due to lateral interactions among LIP neurons. This model reproduces the levels of category selectivity and bias observed under a variety of conditions, as well as the redevelopment of bias after monkeys learn redefined categories. It predicts that LIP receptive fields would spatially cluster by preferred category, which we experimentally confirm. In summary, our model reveals a mechanism by which LIP learns abstract representations and assigns meaning to sensory inputs.",

Here, we investigated whether female rats escalate self-administration of methylone, 3,4-methylenedioxypentedrone (pentylone), and MDMA and then studied consequences of MDMA and pentylone self-administration on GABAA receptor and kappa opioid receptor (KOR) signaling in the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain area critically dysregulated by extended access self-administration of alcohol or cocaine. Adult female Wistar rats were trained to self-administer methylone, pentylone, MDMA (0.5 mg/kg/infusion), or saline-vehicle using a fixed-ratio 1 response contingency in 6-hour sessions (long-access: LgA) followed by progressive ratio (PR) dose-response testing. The effects of pentylone-LgA, MDMA-LgA and saline on basal GABAergic transmission (miniature postsynaptic inhibitory currents, mIPSCs) and the modulatory role of KOR at CeA GABAergic synapses were determined in acute brain slices using whole-cell patch-clamp. Methylone-LgA and pentylone-LgA rats similarly escalated their drug intake (both obtained more infusions compared to MDMA-LgA rats) however, pentylone-LgA rats reached higher breakpoints in PR tests. At the cellular level, baseline CeA GABA transmission was markedly elevated in pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline-vehicle. Specifically, pentylone-LgA was associated with increased CeA mIPSC frequency (GABA release) and amplitude (postsynaptic GABAA receptor function), while mIPSC amplitudes (but not frequency) was larger in MDMA-LgA rats compared to saline rats. In addition, pentylone-LgA and MDMA-LgA profoundly disrupted CeA KOR signaling such as both KOR agonism (1mM U50488) and KOR antagonism (200nM nor-binaltorphimine) decreased mIPSC frequency suggesting recruitment of non-canonical KOR signaling pathways. This study confirms escalated self-administration of entactogen psychostimulants under LgA conditions in female rats which is accompanied by increased CeA GABAergic inhibition and altered KOR signaling. Collectively, our study suggests that CeA GABA and KOR mechanisms play a critical role in entactogen self-administration like those observed with escalation of alcohol or cocaine self-administration.",

    "abstract": "Scene construction is a key component of memory recall, navigation, and future imagining, and relies on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). A parallel body of work suggests that eye movements may enable the imagination and construction of scenes, even in the absence of external visual input. There are vast structural and functional connections between regions of the MTL and those of the oculomotor system. However, the directionality of connections between the MTL and oculomotor control regions, and how it relates to scene construction, has not been studied directly in human neuroimaging. In the current study, we used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to interrogate effective connectivity between the MTL and oculomotor regions using a scene construction task in which participants eye movements were either restricted (fixed-viewing) or unrestricted (free-viewing). By omitting external visual input, and by contrasting free- versus fixed- viewing, the directionality of neural connectivity during scene construction could be determined. As opposed to when eye movements were restricted, allowing free viewing during construction of scenes strengthened top-down connections from the MTL to the frontal eye fields, and to lower-level cortical visual processing regions, suppressed bottom-up connections along the visual stream, and enhanced vividness of the constructed scenes. Taken together, these findings provide novel, non-invasive evidence for the causal architecture between the MTL memory system and oculomotor system associated with constructing vivid mental representations of scenes.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe role of eye movements in mentally constructing scene imagery was investigated\nC_LIO_LIRestricting eye movements impaired vividness of constructed scene imagery\nC_LIO_LIMaking eye movements strengthened connectivity from memory to oculomotor regions\nC_LI",

Virion structure is of interest, not only in the context of virus assembly, but also because pleomorphic variations may correlate with infectivity and pathogenicity. We have used fluorescence super-resolution microscopy combined with a rapid automated analysis pipeline to image many thousands of individual influenza virions, gaining information on their size, morphology and the distribution of membrane-embedded and internal proteins. We observed broad phenotypic variability in filament size, and Fourier transform analysis of super resolution images demonstrated no generalized common spatial frequency patterning of HA or NA on the virion surface, suggesting a model of virus particle assembly where the release of progeny filaments from cells occurs in a stochastic way. Finally, we showed that in long filaments, viral RNP complexes are located preferentially within Archetti bodies, suggesting that these structures may play a role in virus transmission. Our approach therefore offers exciting new insights into influenza virus morphology and represents a powerful technique that is easily extendable to the study of pleomorphism in other pathogenic viruses.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian retromer is comprised of subunits VPS26, VPS29 and VPS35, and a more loosely-associated sorting nexin (SNX) heterodimer. Despite known roles for the retromer in multiple trafficking events in yeast and mammalian cells, its role in development is poorly understood, and its potential function in primary ciliogenesis remains unknown. Using CRISPR-Cas9 editing, we demonstrated that vps-26 homozygous knockout C. elegans have reduced brood sizes and impaired vulval development, as well as decreased body length which has been linked to defects in primary ciliogenesis. Since many endocytic proteins are implicated in the generation of primary cilia, we addressed whether the retromer regulates ciliogenesis in mammalian cells. We observed VPS35 localized to the primary cilium, and depletion of VPS26, VPS35 or SNX1/SNX5 led to decreased ciliogenesis. Retromer also coimmunoprecipitated with the capping protein, CP110, and was required for its removal from the mother centriole. Herein, we characterize new roles for the retromer in C. elegans development and in the regulation of ciliogenesis in mammalian cells, and suggest a novel role for the retromer in CP110 removal from the mother centriole.",

    "abstract": "Notch signaling is a conserved pathway that converts extracellular receptor-ligand interactions into changes in gene expression via a single transcription factor (CBF1/RBPJ in mammals; Su(H) in Drosophila). In humans, RBPJ variants have been linked to Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by scalp, cranium, and limb defects. Here, we found that a previously described Drosophila Su(H) allele encodes a missense mutation that alters an analogous residue found in an AOS-associated RBPJ variant. Importantly, genetic studies support a model that Drosophila with a single copy of the AOS-like Su(H) allele behave in an opposing manner as flies with a Su(H) null allele due to a dominant activity of sequestering either the Notch co-activator or the antagonistic Hairless co-repressor. Consistent with this model, AOS-like Su(H) and Rbpj variants decrease DNA binding activity compared to wild type proteins, but these variants do not significantly alter protein binding to the Notch co-activator or the fly and mammalian co-repressors, respectively. Taken together, these data suggest a cofactor sequestration mechanism underlies AOS phenotypes associated with RBPJ variants, whereby a single RBPJ allele encodes a protein with compromised DNA binding activity that retains cofactor binding, resulting in Notch target gene dysregulation.",

Blood coagulation factor Xa (FXa) and SARS-CoV-2 major protease (Mpro) share over 80% homology at the three-dimensional protein level. Thus, it is worth interrogating whether there is crosstalk between inhibitors and substrates between these enzymes. Here, we found that the clinically-approved FXa inhibitor apixaban targets SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with a 21-fold higher potency than boceprevir (GC376). Apixaban displayed a non-competitive mechanism of inhibition towards Mpro, since it targets the enzyme/substrate complex and the allosteric site onto the viral protease. Enzymatic assays were further validated in infected Calu-3 cells, which reveal that apixaban decreases the production of infectious viral particles in a dose-dependent manner, with an inhibitory potency in the micromolar range. Our results are in line with the proposed early use of anticoagulants, including FXa inhibitors, to improve clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients. In this context, apixaban may display a dual mechanism of action by targeting FXa to prevent coagulopathy and, at some level, SARS-CoV-2 Mpro.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundResearch suggests that cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), amyloid, and pTau contribute to age-related cognitive decline. It remains unknown how these factors relate to one another, nor how they jointly contribute to cognitive decline in normal aging. This project examines the association between these pathologies and their relationship to cognitive decline in cognitively normal older adults without subjective cognitive decline.\n\nMethodsA total of 230 subjects with CSF A{beta}42, CSF pTau181, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) used as a proxy of CSVD and cognitive scores from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were included. Associations between each pathology and cognitive score were investigated using regression models. Furthermore, relationships between the three pathologies were also examined using regression models.\n\nResultsAt baseline, there was an inverse association between WMH load and A{beta}42 (t=-4.20, p<.001). There was no association between WMH load and pTau (t=0.32, p=0.75), nor with A{beta}42 and pTau (t=0.51, p=.61). Correcting for age, sex and education, baseline WMH load was associated with baseline ADAS-13 scores (t=2.59, p=.01) and lower follow-up executive functioning (t= -2.84, p=.005). Baseline A{beta}42 was associated with executive function at baseline (t=3.58, p<.004) but not at follow-up (t=1.05, p=0.30), nor with ADAS-13 at baseline (t=-0.24, p0.81) or follow-up (t=0.09, p=0.93). Finally, baseline pTau was not associated with any cognitive measure at baseline or follow-up.\n\nConclusionBoth baseline A{beta}42 and WMH load are associated with some baseline cognition scores, but only baseline WMH load is associated with follow-up executive functioning, indicating that it may be one of the earliest pathologies that contributes to future cognitive decline, in cognitively healthy older adults. Given that healthy older adults with WMH pathology exhibit declines in cognitive functioning, they may be less resilient to future pathology increasing their risk for cognitive impairment due to dementia than those without WMHs.",

    "abstract": "Termites are major decomposers of organic matter in terrestrial ecosystems and the second most diverse lineage of social insects. The Kalotermitidae, the second-largest termite family, are widely distributed across tropical and subtropical ecosystems, where they typically live in small colonies confined to single wood items inhabited by individuals with no foraging abilities. How the Kalotermitidae have acquired their global distribution patterns remains unresolved. Similarly, it is unclear whether foraging is ancestral to Kalotermitidae or was secondarily acquired in a few species. These questions can be addressed in a phylogenetic framework. We inferred time-calibrated phylogenetic trees of Kalotermitidae using mitochondrial genomes and nuclear ribosomal RNA genes of [~]120 species, about 27% of kalotermitid diversity, including representatives of 22 of the 23 kalotermitid genera. We found that extant kalotermitids shared a common ancestor 81 Mya (72-91 Mya 95% HPD), indicating that a few disjunctions among early-diverging kalotermitid lineages may predate Gondwana breakup. However, most of the [~]40 disjunctions among biogeographic realms were dated at less than 50 Mya, indicating that transoceanic dispersals, and more recently human-mediated dispersals, have been the major drivers of the global distribution of Kalotermitidae. Our phylogeny also revealed that the capacity to forage is often found in early-diverging kalotermitid lineages, implying that the ancestors of Kalotermitidae were able to forage among multiple wood pieces. Our phylogenetic estimates provide a platform for a critical taxonomic revision of the family and for future comparative analyses of Kalotermitidae.",

    "abstract": "The opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major cause of nosocomial infections, uses carbohydrate-binding proteins (lectins) as part of its binding to host cells. The fucose-binding lectin, LecB, displays a unique carbohydrate-binding site that incorporates two closely located calcium ions bridging between the ligand and protein, providing specificity and unusually high affinity. Here, we investigate the mechanisms involved in binding based on neutron crystallography studies of a fully deuterated LecB/fucose/calcium complex. The neutron structure, which includes the positions of all the hydrogen atoms, reveals that the high affinity of binding may be related to the occurrence of a low barrier hydrogen bond induced by the proximity of the two calcium ions, the presence of coordination rings between the sugar, calcium and LecB, and the dynamic behaviour of bridging water molecules at room temperature. These key structural details may assist in the design of anti-adhesive compounds to combat multi-resistance bacterial infections.",

We developed protocols to activate CDK1:Cyclin-B either in vitro with purified CDK1 activating kinases (CAK) or in insect cells through CDK-CAK co-expression. To boost kinase processivity, we reconstituted a tripartite complex consisting of CDK1, Cyclin-B, and CKS1.

    "abstract": "Despite the beneficial effects of xenotopically expressing the mitochondrial alternative oxidase AOX from Ciona intestinalis in mammalian and insect models, important detrimental outcomes have also been reported, raising concerns regarding its potential deployment as a therapeutic enzyme for human mitochondrial diseases. Because of its non-protonmotive terminal oxidase activity, AOX can bypass the cytochrome segment of the respiratory chain whilst not contributing to mitochondrial ATP synthesis. We have previously shown that pupal lethality occurs when AOX-expressing Drosophila larvae are cultured on a low-nutrient diet, indicating that AOX can perturb normal metabolism during development. Here, combined omics analyses revealed multiple correlates of this diet-dependent lethality, including a general alteration of larval amino acid and lipid metabolism, functional and morphological changes to the larval digestive tract, and a drastic decrease in larval biomass accumulation. Pupae at the pre-lethality stage presented a general downregulation of mitochondrial metabolism and a signature of starvation and deregulated signaling. AOX-induced lethality was partially rescued when the low-nutrient diet was supplemented with tryptophan and/or methionine, but not with proline and/or glutamate, strongly suggesting perturbation of one-carbon metabolism. The developmental dependence on tryptophan and/or methionine, associated with elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, 2-hydroxyglutarate, choline-containing metabolites and breakdown products of membrane phospholipids, indicates that AOX expression promotes tissue proliferation and larval growth, but this is ultimately limited by energy dissipation due to partial mitochondrial uncoupling. We speculate that the combination of dietary interventions and AOX expression might, nevertheless, be useful for the metabolic regulation of proliferative tissues, such as tumors.",

Altered arm swing and lower limb asymmetry (LLA) may be contributing factors having been shown to affect the magnitude and dynamics of variability in spatiotemporal and trunk motion.

Participants completed six trials, combining three arm swing (AS) amplitude (normal, active, held) and two LLA (symmetrical, asymmetrical) conditions. The mean standard deviation (meanSD), maximum Lyapunov exponent ({lambda}max), detrended fluctuation analysis scaling exponent of range of motion (DFA), and sample entropy (SaEn) were computed for tridimensional trunk, pelvis, and lower limb joint angles, and compared using repeated-measures ANOVAs.\n\nRelative to normal AS, active AS increased meanSD of all joint angles, {lambda}max of frontal plane hip and ankle angles, and SaEn of sagittal plane ankle angles. Active AS, however, did not affect {lambda}max or SaEn of trunk or pelvis angles. LLA increased meanSD of sagittal plane joint angles, {lambda}max of Euclidean norm trunk angle and of lower limb joint angles, and SaEn of ankle dorsiflexion/ plantarflexion, but decreased SaEn of tridimensional trunk angles and hip rotation in the slower moving leg.\n\nAlterations in lower limb variability with active AS and LLA suggest that young adults actively exploit their lower limb redundancies to maintain gait.

In a large animal, these mechano-active microcapsules (MAMCs) were assessed through two different delivery strategies. Intra-articular injection of control MAMCs enabled fluorescent quantification of MAMC rupture and cargo release in a synovial joint setting over time in vivo. This joint-wide injection also confirmed that the MAMCs do not elicit an inflammatory response. In the contralateral hindlimbs, chondral defects were created, MAMCs were locally administered, and nanofracture (Nfx), a clinically utilized method to promote cartilage repair, was performed. The NFx holes enabled marrow-derived stromal cells to enter the defect area and served as repeatable bone injury sites to monitor over time. Animals were evaluated 1 and 2 weeks after injection and surgery. Analysis of injected MAMCs showed that bioactive cargo was released in a controlled fashion over 2 weeks. A bone fluorochrome label injected at the time of surgery displayed maintenance of mineral labeling in the therapeutic group, but resorption in both control groups. Alkaline phosphatase (AP) staining at the osteochondral interface revealed higher AP activity in defects treated with therapeutic MAMCs. Overall, this study establishes a new micro-fluidically generated delivery platform that releases therapeutic factors in an articulating joint, and reduces this to practice in the delivery of therapeutics that preserve bone structure after osteochondral injury.",

    "abstract": "Environmentally-mediated drug resistance in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) significantly contributes to relapse. Stromal cells in the bone marrow environment protect leukemia cells by secretion of chemokines as cues for BCP-ALL migration towards, and adhesion to, stroma. Stromal cells and BCP-ALL cells communicate through stromal galectin-3. Here, we investigated the significance of stromal galectin-3 to BCP-ALL cells. We used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to ablate galectin-3 in stromal cells and found that galectin-3 is dispensable for steady-state BCP-ALL proliferation and viability. However, efficient leukemia migration and adhesion to stromal cells are significantly dependent on stromal galectin-3. Importantly, loss of stromal galectin-3 production sensitized BCP-ALL cells to conventional chemotherapy. We therefore tested novel carbohydrate-based small molecule compounds (Cpd14 and Cpd17) with high specificity for galectin-3. Consistent with results obtained using galectin-3-knockout stromal cells, treatment of stromal-BCP-ALL co-cultures inhibited BCP-ALL migration and adhesion. Moreover, these compounds induced anti-leukemic responses in BCP-ALL cells including a dose-dependent reduction of viability and proliferation, induction of apoptosis and, importantly, inhibition of drug resistance. Collectively, these findings indicate galectin-3 regulates BCP-ALL cell responses to chemotherapy through the interactions between leukemia cells and the stroma, and show that a combination of galectin-3 inhibition with conventional drugs can sensitize the leukemia cells to chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Acute kidney injury is common, with [~]13 million cases and 1.7 million deaths/year worldwide. A major cause is renal ischemia, typically following cardiac surgery, renal transplant or severe hemorrhage. We examined the cause of the sustained reduction in renal blood flow (\"no-reflow\"), which exacerbates kidney injury even after an initial cause of compromised blood supply is removed. After 60 min kidney ischemia and 30-60 min reperfusion, renal blood flow remained reduced, especially in the medulla, and kidney tubule damage was detected as Kim-1 expression. Constriction of the medullary descending vasa recta and cortical peritubular capillaries occurred near pericyte somata, and led to capillary blockages, yet glomerular arterioles and perfusion were unaffected, implying that the long-lasting decrease of renal blood flow contributing to kidney damage was generated by pericytes. Blocking Rho kinase to decrease pericyte contractility from the start of reperfusion increased the post-ischemic diameter of the descending vasa recta capillaries at pericytes, reduced the percentage of capillaries that remained blocked, increased medullary blood flow and reduced kidney injury. Thus, post-ischemic renal no-reflow, contributing to acute kidney injury, reflects pericytes constricting the descending vasa recta and peritubular capillaries. Pericytes are therefore an important therapeutic target for treating acute kidney injury.",

Here we develop a recurrent neural network constrained by prior knowledge of the signaling network with ligand concentrations as input, TF activity as output and signaling molecules as hidden nodes. Simulations are assumed to reach steady state, and we regularize the parameters to enforce this.

    "abstract": "The basal ganglia (BG) is part of a basic feedback circuit, regulating cortical function, such as voluntary movement control, via their influence on thalamocortical projections. BG disorders, namely Parkinsons disease (PD), characterized by the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra, involve the progressive loss of motor functions. At the present, PD is incurable. Converging evidence suggests the onset of PD-specific pathology prior to the appearance of classical motor signs. This latent phase of neurodegeneration in PD is of particular relevance in developing more effective therapies by intervening at the earliest stages of disease. Therefore, a key challenge in PD research is to identify and validate markers for the preclinical and prodromal stage of the illness.\n\nWe propose a mechanistic neurocomputational model of the BG at mesoscopic scale to investigate the behavior of the simulated neural system after several degrees of lesion of the substantia nigra, with the aim of possibly evaluating which is the smallest lesion compromising motor learning. In other words, we developed a working framework for the analysis of theoretical early-stage PD. While simulations in healthy conditions confirm the key role of dopamine in learning, in pathological conditions networks predict that there may exist abnormalities of motor learning process for physiological alterations in the BG which do not yet involve the presence of symptoms typical of the clinical diagnosis. Our model may account for the discovery of markers for an early diagnosis of the disease and give directions for developing novel noninvasive support systems.",

Here we used tandem affinity tag-based proteomics to isolate and analyze the MIT complex and reveal that Phostensin (PTSN), a regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 1, is a component of the complex. PTSN mediates de-phosphorylation of Rap1 thereby preserving the activity and membrane localization of Rap1 to stabilize the MIT complex. CRISPR/Cas9-induced deletion of PPP1R18, which encodes PTSN, markedly suppresses integrin activation in Jurkat human T cells. We generated apparently healthy Ppp1r18-/- mice that manifest lymphocytosis and reduced population of peripheral lymphoid tissues ascribable to defective activation of integrins L{beta}2 and 4{beta}7. Ppp1r18-/- T cells exhibit reduced capacity to induce colitis in a murine adoptive transfer model. Thus, PTSN enables lymphocyte integrin-mediated functions by dephosphorylating Rap1 to stabilize the MIT complex. As a consequence, loss of PTSN ameliorates T cell-mediated colitis.\n\nSUMMARYPhostensin, a protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit, supports lymphocyte integrin-dependent functions by mediating dephosphorylation of Rap1 to stabilize the MIT complex thereby enabling the population of peripheral lymphoid organs and T cell-mediated colitis.",

    "abstract": "Campylobacter is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide and diarrheal disease is a major cause of child morbidity, growth faltering and mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite evidence of high incidence and differences in disease epidemiology, there is limited genomic data from studies in developing countries. In this study, we characterised the genetic diversity and accessory genome content of a collection of Campylobacter isolates from Cairo, Egypt. In total, 112 Campylobacter isolates were collected from broiler carcasses (n=31), milk and dairy products (n=24) and patients (n=57) suffering from gastroenteritis. Among the most common sequence types (STs) we identified were the globally disseminated, host generalist ST-21 clonal complex (CC21) and the poultry specialist CC206, CC464 and CC48. Notably, CC45 and the cattle-specialist CC42 were under-represented with a total absence of CC61. Comparative genomics were used to quantify core and accessory genome sharing among isolates from the same country compared to sharing between countries. Lineage-specific accessory genome sharing was significantly higher among isolates from the same country, particularly CC21 which demonstrated greater local geographical clustering. In contrast, no geographic clustering was noted in either the core or accessory genomes of the CC828, suggesting a highly admixed population. A greater proportion of C. coli isolates were multidrug resistant (MDR) compared to C. jejuni. This is a significant public health concern as MDR food chain pathogens are difficult to treat and often pose increased mortality risk demanding enhanced prevention strategies in the Egyptian market to combat such a threat.\n\nImpact statementCampylobacter is the leading bacterial cause of gastroenteritis worldwide and despite high incidence in low- and middle-income countries, where infection can be fatal, culture-based isolation is rare and the genotypes responsible for disease are seldom identified. Here, we sequenced the genomes of a collection of isolates from clinical cases and potential infection reservoirs from Cairo in Egypt and characterised their genetic diversity. Among the most common genotypes we identified were globally disseminated lineages implicated in human disease worldwide, including the host generalist ST-21 clonal complex (CC21) and the poultry specialist genotypes CC206, CC464 and CC48. Notably however, some other globally common genotypes were under-represented or entirely absent from our collection, including those from cattle-specialist lineages, CC42 and CC61. By focussing on specific lineages, we demonstrate that there is increased accessory genome sharing in specific clonal complexes. This increased local sharing of genes may have contributed to a greater proportion of C. coli isolates possessing antimicrobial resistance determinants that suggest they could be multidrug resistant (MDR). This is a significant public health concern as MDR food chain pathogens are difficult to treat and often pose increased mortality risk demanding enhanced prevention strategies.\n\nData summaryShort read data are available on the NCBI Sequence Read Archive, associated with BioProject PRJNA576513 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA576513).

Leukocyte counts, procalcitonin, and nitric oxide also were measured 0, 2, and 4 hours after the induction of sepsis using the cecal ligation and puncture method. The animals were divided into two groups: control (SHAM) and induced. Procalcitonin levels remained within the normal range for an inflammatory response throughout the experiment. There was a statistically insignificant increase in nitric oxide levels. All animals showed increased diastolic arterial blood pressure; however, the increase in the induced animals was even more pronounced. Procalcitonin and nitric oxide levels can increase due to surgical manipulation, while arterial blood pressure was not a good predictor for the onset of sepsis during the time period studied here.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, cell-free synthetic glycobiology technologies have emerged that enable production and remodeling of glycoproteins outside the confines of the cell. However, many of these systems combine multiple synthesis steps into one pot where there can be competing reactions and side products that ultimately lead to low yield of the desired product. In this work, we describe a microfluidic platform that integrates cell-free protein synthesis, glycosylation, and purification of a model glycoprotein in separate compartments where each step can be individually optimized. Microfluidics offer advantages such as reaction compartmentalization, tunable residence time, the ability to tether enzymes for reuse, and the potential for continuous manufacturing. Moreover, it affords an opportunity for spatiotemporal control of glycosylation reactions that is difficult to achieve with existing cell-based and cell-free glycosylation systems. In this work, we demonstrate a flow-based glycoprotein synthesis system that promotes enhanced cell-free protein synthesis, efficient protein glycosylation with an immobilized oligosaccharyltransferase, and enrichment of the protein product from cell-free lysate. Overall, this work represents a first-in-kind glycosylation-on-a-chip prototype that could find use as a laboratory tool for mechanistic dissection of the protein glycosylation process as well as a biomanufacturing platform for small batch, decentralized glycoprotein production.",

To persist in the bacterial flora of the host, some bacteria produce antibacterial factors such as the antimicrobial peptides known as bacteriocins.

Among 150 S. epidermidis isolates from the oral cavities of 287 volunteers, we detected two bacteriocin-producing strains, KSE56 and KSE650. Complete genome sequences of the two strains confirmed that they carried the epidermin-harbouring plasmid pEpi56 and the nukacin IVK45-like- harbouring plasmid pNuk650. The amino acid sequence of epidermin from KSE56 was identical to the previously reported sequence, but the epidermin synthesis-related genes were partially different. The prepeptide amino acid sequences of nukacin KSE650 and nukacin IVK45 showed one mismatch, but both mature peptides were entirely similar. pNuk650 was larger and had an additional seven ORFs compared to pIVK45. We then investigated the antibacterial activity of the two strains against several skin and oral bacteria and found their different activity patterns. In conclusion, we report the complete sequences of 2 plasmids coding for bacteriocins from S. epidermidis, which were partially different from those previously reported.

How animal behavior changes over time has been explored through well-known ecological theories like niche partitioning and predator-prey dynamics. Yet, changes in animal behavior within the shorter 24-hour light-dark cycle have largely gone unstudied. Understanding if an animal can adjust their temporal activity to mitigate or adapt to environmental change has become a recent topic of discussion and is important for effective wildlife management and conservation. While spatial habitat is a fundamental consideration in wildlife management and conservation, temporal habitat is often ignored. We formulated a temporal resource selection model to quantify the diel behavior of eight mammal species across ten U.S. cities. We found high variability in diel activity patterns within and among species and species-specific correlations between diel activity and human population density, impervious land cover, available greenspace, vegetation cover, and mean daily temperature. We also found that some species may modulate temporal behaviors to manage both natural and anthropogenic risks. Our results highlight the complexity with which temporal activity patterns interact with local environmental characteristics, and suggest that urban mammals may use time along the 24-hour cycle to reduce risk, adapt, and therefore persist in human-dominated ecosystems.",

    "abstract": "Organellar genomes often carry group II introns, which occasionally encode proteins called maturases that are important for splicing. The number of introns varies substantially among various organellar genomes, and bursts of introns have been observed in multiple eukaryotic lineages, including euglenophytes, with more than 100 introns in their plastid genomes. To examine the evolutionary diversity and history of maturases, an essential gene family among euglenophytes, we searched for their homologs in newly sequenced and published plastid genomes representing all major euglenophytes lineages. We found that maturase content in plastid genomes has a patchy distribution, with a maximum of eight of them present in Eutreptiella eupharyngea. The most basal lineages of euglenophytes, Eutreptiales, share the highest number of maturases, but the lowest number of introns. We also identified a peculiar convoluted structure of a gene located in an intron, in a gene within an intron, within yet another gene, present in some Eutreptiales. Further investigation of functional domains of identified maturases shown that most of them lost at least one of the functional domains, which implies that the patchy maturase distribution is due to frequent inactivation and eventual loss over time. Finally, we identified the diversified evolutionary origin of analysed maturases, which were acquired along with the green algal plastid or horizontally transferred. These findings indicate that euglenophytes plastid maturases have experienced a surprisingly dynamic history due to gains from diversified donors, their retention, and loss.",

The C. briggsae genome sequence has accelerated research by facilitating the generation of new resources, tools, and functional studies of genes. While substantial progress has been made in predicting genes and start sites, experimental evidence is still lacking in many cases. Here, we report an improved annotation of the C. briggsae genome using the Trans-spliced Exon Coupled RNA End Determination (TEC-RED) technique. In addition to identifying the 5 ends of expressed genes, we have discovered operons and paralogs. In summary, our analysis yielded 10,243 unique 5 end sequence tags with matches in the C. briggsae genome. Of these, 6,395 were found to represent 4,252 unique genes along with 362 paralogs and 52 previously unknown exons. These genes included 14 that are exclusively trans-spliced in C. briggsae when compared with C. elegans orthologs. A major contribution of this study is the identification of 493 operons, of which two-thirds are fully supported by tags. In addition, two SL1-type operons were discovered. Interestingly, comparisons with C. elegans showed that only 40% of operons are conserved. Of the remaining operons, 73 are novel, including 12 that entirely lack orthologs in C. elegans. Further analysis revealed that four of the 12 novel operons are conserved in C. nigoni. Altogether, the work described here has significantly advanced our understanding of the C. briggsae system and serves as a rich resource to aid biological studies involving this species.",

    "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most challenging clinical issues. It is characterized by the disruption of neural circuitry and connectivity, resulting in neurological disability. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) serve as a promising source of therapeutic cells for SCI treatment. However, the therapeutic outcomes of direct ADSCs transplantation are limited in the presence of an inflammatory microenvironment. Herein, a cell-adaptable neurogenic (CaNeu) hydrogel was developed as a delivery vehicle for ADSCs to promote neuronal regeneration after SCI. The dynamic network of CaNeu hydrogel loaded with ADSCs provides a cell-infiltratable matrix that enhances axonal growth and eventually leads to improved motor evoked potential, hindlimb strength, and coordination of complete spinal cord transection in rats. Furthermore, the CaNeu hydrogel also establishes an anti-inflammatory microenvironment by inducing a shift in the polarization of the recruited macrophages toward the pro-regeneration (M2) phenotype. Our study showed that the CaNeu-hydrogel-mediated ADSCs delivery resulted in significantly suppressed neuroinflammation and apoptosis, and that this phenomenon involved the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Our findings indicate that the CaNeu hydrogel is a valuable delivery vehicle to assist stem cell therapy for SCI, providing a promising strategy for central nervous system diseases.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundClinical researchers are trying to unravel the impact of different training interventions on the kinematics of human gait. However, the effects of long-term training experience on the kinematics of a healthy gait pattern remains unclear. Here we assess the effect of long-term training experience on joint angle variability during walking.\n\nMethodsHip, knee, and ankle joint angles from fourteen soccer players and sixteen controls were acquired during treadmill and overground walking. Hip-knee coupling, knee-ankle coupling and coupling angle variability (CAV) of the right leg in the sagittal plane were assessed using a vector coding technique.\n\nResultsSoccer players showed reduced hip-knee CAV during the mid-stance and terminal-stance phases and reduced knee-ankle CAV during the pre-swing phase of gait compared to the control group. In addition, soccer players less often used an ankle coordination pattern, in which only the ankle joint but not the knee joint rotates.\n\nInterpretationThese findings show that soccer players had more stability in the ankle joint during the stance phase of the gait compared to the control group. Future studies can test whether these differences in the coordination of the ankle joint reflect the effects of long-term training on normal gait by comparing knee-ankle coupling and variability before and after exercise training interventions.",

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive, painless and reproducible examination which allows ophthalmologists to visualize retinal layers. This imaging modality is useful to detect diseases such as diabetic macular edema (DME) or age related macular degeneration (AMD), which are associated with fluid accumulations. In this paper, a cascade of deep convolutional neural networks is proposed using ENets for the segmentation of fluid accumulations in OCT B-Scans. After denoising the B-Scans, a first ENet extracts the region of interest (ROI) between the inner limiting membrane (ILM) and the Bruchs membrane (BM), whereas the second ENet segments the fluid in the ROI. A random forest classifier was applied on the segmented fluid regions to reject false positive. Our framework was trained on three different datasets with several diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and AMD. Our method achieves an average Dice Score for fluid segmentation of 0.80, 0.83 and 0.83 on the UMN DME, UMN AMD and Kermany datasets respectively.",
