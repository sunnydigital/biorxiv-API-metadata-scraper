    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking has multiple serious negative health consequences. However, the epidemiological relationship between cigarette smoking and SARS-CoV-2 infection is controversial; and the interaction between cigarette smoking, airway expression of the ACE2 receptor and the susceptibility of airway cells to infection is unclear. We exposed differentiated air-liquid interface cultures derived from primary human airway stem cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and infected them with SARS-CoV-2. We found that CSE increased expression of full-length ACE2 (flACE2) but did not alter the expression of a Type I-interferon sensitive truncated ACE2 that lacks the capacity to bind SARS-CoV-2 or a panel of interferon-sensitive genes. Importantly, exposure to CSE did not increase viral infectivity despite the increase in flACE2. Our data are consistent with epidemiological data suggesting current smokers are not at excess risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. This does not detract from public health messaging emphasising the excess risk of severe COVID-19 associated with smoking-related cardiopulmonary disease.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation at the SLC16A11 locus contributes to the disproportionate impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D) on Latino populations. We recently demonstrated that T2D risk variants reduce SLC16A11 liver expression and function of MCT11, the monocarboxylate transporter encoded by the SLC16A11 gene. Here, we show that SLC16A11 expression within the liver is primarily localized to the low oxygen pericentral region, and that T2D risk variants disrupt oxygen-regulated SLC16A11 expression in human hepatocytes. Under physiologic oxygen conditions, MCT11 deficiency alters hepatocyte glucose metabolism, resulting in elevated intracellular lactate and a metabolic shift toward triacylglycerol accumulation. We also demonstrate an impact of Mct11 deficiency on glucose and lipid metabolism in Slc16a11 knockout mice, which display physiological changes that are observed in individuals with T2D. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into how SLC16A11 disruption impacts hepatic energy metabolism and T2D risk, and highlight MCT11-mediated regulation of lactate levels as a potential therapeutic target.",

    "abstract": "The dueling roles of H2S as an endogenously synthesized respiratory substrate and as a toxin, raise questions as to how it is cleared when the electron transport chain is inhibited. Sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) is a mitochondrial inner membrane flavoprotein that catalyzes the first step in the H2S oxidation pathway and uses coenzyme Q (CoQ) as an electron acceptor. However, complex IV poisoning by H2S inhibits complex III-dependent recycling of CoQH2, which is needed to sustain H2S oxidation. We have discovered that under these conditions, reversal of complex II activity using fumarate as an electron acceptor, establishes a new redox cycle with SQOR. The purine nucleotide cycle and the malate aspartate shuttle are sources of fumarate in H2S treated cells, which accumulate succinate. Complex II knockdown decreases the efficiency of H2S clearance and increases recovery time to the basal respiration rate in H2S treated cells. In contrast, attenuation of complex I, which is a major competitor for the mitochondrial CoQ pool, has the opposite effects. Targeted knockout of complex II in murine intestinal epithelial cells that are routinely exposed to microbiota derived H2S, decreases serum, urine, and fecal thiosulfate, a product of H2S oxidation. Our study identifies a metabolic reprogramming response to H2S that furnishes fumarate as an alternate electron acceptor and supports H2S oxidation independent of complex IV activity. Complex II-linked redox cycling of SQOR has important implications for gut H2S metabolism as colonocytes are routinely exposed to high concentrations of this gas derived from the microbiota.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryReversal of complex II sustains and prioritizes H2S oxidation when respiration is poisoned.",

    "abstract": "Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is characterised by descending skeletal muscle weakness and wasting. FSHD is caused by mis-expression of the transcription factor DUX4, which is linked to oxidative stress, a condition especially detrimental to skeletal muscle with its high metabolic activity and energy demands. Oxidative damage characterises FSHD and recent work suggests metabolic dysfunction and perturbed hypoxia signalling as novel pathomechanisms. However, redox biology of FSHD remains poorly understood, and integrating the complex dynamics of DUX4-induced metabolic changes is lacking.\n\nHere we pinpoint the kinetic involvement of altered mitochondrial RONS metabolism and impaired mitochondrial function in aetiology of oxidative stress in FSHD. Transcriptomic analysis in FSHD muscle biopsies reveals strong enrichment for pathways involved in mitochondrial complex I assembly, nitrogen metabolism, oxidative stress response and hypoxia signalling. We found elevated ROS levels correlate with increases in steady-state mitochondrial membrane potential in FSHD myogenic cells. DUX4 triggers mitochondrial membrane polarisation prior to oxidative stress generation and apoptosis through mitochondrial ROS, and affects NO{middle dot} bioavailability via mitochondrial peroxidation. We identify complex I as the primary target for DUX4-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, with strong correlation between complex I-linked respiration and cellular oxygenation/hypoxia signalling activity in environmental hypoxia. Thus, FSHD myogenesis is uniquely susceptible to hypoxia-induced oxidative stress as a consequence of metabolic mis-adaptation. Importantly, mitochondria-targeted antioxidants rescue FSHD pathology more effectively than conventional antioxidants, highlighting the central involvement of disturbed mitochondrial RONS metabolism. This work provides a pathomechanistic model by which DUX4-induced changes in oxidative metabolism impair muscle function in FSHD, amplified when metabolic adaptation to varying O2 tension is required.\n\nHighlightsO_LITranscriptomics data from FSHD muscle indicates enrichment for disturbed mitochondrial pathways\nC_LIO_LIDisturbed RONS metabolism correlates with mitochondrial membrane polarisation and myotube hypotrophy\nC_LIO_LIDUX4-induced changes in mitochondrial function precede oxidative stress through mitoROS and affect hypoxia signalling via complex I\nC_LIO_LIFSHD is sensitive to environmental hypoxia, which increases ROS levels in FSHD myotubes\nC_LIO_LIHypotrophy in hypoxic FSHD myotubes is efficiently rescued with mitochondria-targeted antioxidants\nC_LI\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=107 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/459509v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16ae1a8org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@517caorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@5d0734org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@183ef50_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

We identified {Delta}7-DA as the endogenous Ss-DAF-12 ligand and elucidated the hormones biosynthetic pathway. Genetic loss of function of the ligands rate-limiting enzyme demonstrated that {Delta}7-DA synthesis is necessary for parasite reproduction, whereas its absence is required for development of infectious larvae. Availability of the ligand permits Ss-DAF-12 to function as an on/off switch governing autoinfection, making it vulnerable to therapeutic intervention. In a preclinical model of hyperinfection, pharmacologic activation of DAF-12 suppressed autoinfection and markedly reduced lethality. Moreover, when {Delta}7-DA was administered with ivermectin, the current but limited drug of choice for treating strongyloidiasis, the combinatorial effects of the two drugs resulted in a near cure of the disease.",

    "abstract": "The emergence of current SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) and potential future spillovers of SARS-like coronaviruses into humans pose a major threat to human health and the global economy 1-7. Development of broadly effective coronavirus vaccines that can mitigate these threats is needed 8, 9. Notably, several recent studies have revealed that vaccination of recovered COVID-19 donors results in enhanced nAb responses compared to SARS-CoV-2 infection or vaccination alone 10-13. Here, we utilized a targeted donor selection strategy to isolate a large panel of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) to sarbecoviruses from two such donors. Many of the bnAbs are remarkably effective in neutralization against sarbecoviruses that use ACE2 for viral entry and a substantial fraction also show notable binding to non-ACE2-using sarbecoviruses. The bnAbs are equally effective against most SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and many neutralize the Omicron variant. Neutralization breadth is achieved by bnAb binding to epitopes on a relatively conserved face of the receptor binding domain (RBD) as opposed to strain-specific nAbs to the receptor binding site that are commonly elicited in SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination 14-18. Consistent with targeting of conserved sites, select RBD bnAbs exhibited in vivo protective efficacy against diverse SARS-like coronaviruses in a prophylaxis challenge model. The generation of a large panel of potent bnAbs provides new opportunities and choices for next-generation antibody prophylactic and therapeutic applications and, importantly, provides a molecular basis for effective design of pan-sarbecovirus vaccines.",

    "abstract": "Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) is a saprophyte and a human intracellular pathogen. Upon invasion into mammalian cells, it senses multiple metabolic and environmental signals that collectively trigger its transition to the pathogenic state. One of these signals is the tripeptide glutathione, which acts as an allosteric activator of Lms master virulence regulator, PrfA. While glutathione synthesis by Lm was shown to be critical for PrfA activation and virulence gene expression, it remains unclear how this tripeptide is synthesized under changing environments, especially in light of the observation that Lm is auxotrophic to one of its precursors, cysteine. Here, we show that the ABC transporter TcyKLMN is a cystine/cysteine importer that supplies cysteine for glutathione synthesis, hence mediating the induction of the virulence genes. Further, we demonstrate that this transporter is negatively regulated by three metabolic regulators: CodY, CymR and CysK, which sense and respond to changing concentrations of branched chain amino acids (BCAA) and cysteine. The data indicate that under low concentrations of BCAA, TcyKLMN is up-regulated, driving the production of glutathione by supplying cysteine, thereby facilitating PrfA activation. These findings provide molecular insight into the coupling of Lm metabolism and virulence, connecting BCAA sensing to cysteine uptake and glutathione biosynthesis, as a mechanism that controls virulence gene expression. This study exemplifies how bacterial pathogens sense their intracellular environment and exploit essential metabolites as effectors of virulence.\n\nImportanceBacterial pathogens sense the repertoire of metabolites in the mammalian niche and use this information to shift into a pathogenic state to accomplish successful infection. Glutathione is a virulence-activating signal that is synthesized by L. monocytogenes during infection of mammalian cells. In this study, we show that cysteine uptake via TcyKLMN drives glutathione synthesis and virulence gene expression. The data emphasize the intimate cross-regulation between metabolism and virulence in bacterial pathogens.",

    "abstract": "The capacity of the intestinal microbiota to degrade otherwise indigestible diet components is known to greatly improve the recovery of energy from food. This has led to the hypothesis that increased digestive efficiency may underlie the contribution of the microbiome to obesity. OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice have a consistently higher fat-mass than germ-free or fully colonized counterparts. We therefore investigated their food intake, digestion efficiency, energy expenditure and respiratory quotient using a novel isolator-housed metabolic cage system which allows long-term measurements without contamination risk. This demonstrated that microbiota- released calories are perfectly balanced by decreased food intake in fully colonized versus gnotobiotic OligoMM12 and germ-free mice fed a standard chow diet, i.e., microbiota-released calories can in fact be well-integrated into appetite control. We also observed no significant difference in energy expenditure per gram lean mass between the different microbiota groups, suggesting that cumulative very small differences in energy balance, or altered energy storage must underlie fat accumulation in OligoMM12 mice. Consistent with altered energy storage, major differences were observed in the type of respiratory substrates used in metabolism over the circadian cycle: in germ-free mice the respiratory exchange ratio was consistently lower than that of fully colonized mice at all times of day, indicative of more reliance on fat and less on glucose metabolism. Intriguingly the RER of OligoMM12-colonized gnotobiotic mice phenocopied fully colonized mice during the dark (active/eating) phase but phenocopied germ-free mice during the light (fasting/resting) phase. Further, OligoMM12-colonized mice showed a germ-free-like drop in liver glycogen storage during the light cycle and both liver and plasma metabolomes of OligoMM12 mice clustered closely with germ-free mice. This implies the existence of microbiota functions that are required to maintain normal host metabolism during the resting/fasting phase of circadian cycle, and which are absent in the OligoMM12 consortium.",

However, basic questions remain regarding the mechanisms of DNA repair following Cas-mediated DNA cleavage. We developed CRISPR-Cas12a ribonucleoprotein genome editing in the fungal plant pathogen, Magnaporthe oryzae, and found frequent donor DNA integration despite the absence of long sequence homology. Interestingly, genotyping from hundreds of transformants showed that frequent non-canonical DNA repair outcomes predominated the recovered genome edited strains. Detailed analysis using sanger and nanopore long-read sequencing revealed five classes of DNA repair mutations, including single donor DNA insertions, concatemer donor DNA insertions, large DNA deletions, deletions plus donor DNA insertions, and infrequently we observed INDELs. Our results show that different error-prone DNA repair pathways resolved the Cas12a-mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) based on the DNA sequence of edited strains. Furthermore, we found that the frequency of the different DNA repair outcomes varied across the genome, with some tested loci resulting in more frequent large-scale mutations. These results suggest that DNA repair pathways provide preferential repair across the genome that could create biased genome variation, which has significant implications for genome engineering and the genome evolution in natural populations.",

    "abstract": "Integrons are bacterial genetic elements that can integrate mobile gene cassettes. They are mostly known for spreading antibiotic resistance cassettes among human pathogens. However, beyond clinical settings, gene cassettes encode an extraordinarily diverse range of functions important for bacterial adaptation. The recovery and sequencing of cassettes has promising applications, including: surveillance of clinically important genes, particularly antibiotic resistance determinants; investigating the functional diversity of integron-carrying bacteria; and novel enzyme discovery. Although gene cassettes can be directly recovered using PCR, there are no standardised methods for their amplification and, importantly, for validating sequences as genuine integron gene cassettes. Here, we present reproducible methods for the PCR amplification, sequence processing, and validation of gene cassette amplicons from complex communities. We describe two different PCR assays that either amplify cassettes together with integron integrases, or gene cassettes together within cassette arrays. We compare the use of Nanopore and Illumina sequencing, and present bioinformatic pipelines that filter sequences to ensure that they represent amplicons from genuine integrons. Using a diverse set of environmental DNAs, we show that our approach can consistently recover thousands of unique cassettes per sample and up to hundreds of different integron integrases.

    "abstract": "Rickettsia species (spp.) are strict obligate intracellular bacteria, with some being pathogenic in their mammalian host, including humans. One critical feature of these stealthy group of pathogens is their ability to manipulate hostile cytosolic environments to their benefits. Although our understanding of Rickettsia cell biology and pathogenesis are evolving, the mechanisms by which pathogenic Rickettsia spp. evade host innate immune detection remains elusive. Here, we showed that disease severity in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice infected with R. typhi (etiologic agent of murine typhus) and R. rickettsii (etiologic agent of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever), but not with non-pathogenic R. montanensis, correlated with levels of bacterial burden as detected in the spleens, as well as the serum concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 and to a lesser extent IL- 1{beta}. Antibody-mediated neutralization of IL-1 confirmed a key role in controlling mortality rates and bacterial burdens of rickettsiae-infected WT mice. As macrophages are a primary source of both IL-1 and IL-1{beta} cytokines, we determined the mechanism of the anti-rickettsial activities using bone-marrow-derived macrophages. We found that pathogenic R. typhi and R. rickettsii, but not non-pathogenic R. montanensis, eluded pro- IL-1 induction and benefited pre-dominantly from the reduced IL-1 secretion, via a Caspase-11-Gsdmd-dependent pathway, to facilitate intracytosolic replication. Adoptative transfer experiments identified that IL-1 secretion by macrophages was critical for controlling rickettsiosis in WT mice. In sum, we identified a previously unappreciated pathway by which pathogenic, unlike non-pathogenic, rickettsiae preferentially target the Caspase-11-Gsdmd-IL-1 signaling axis in macrophages thus supporting their replication within the host.\n\nIMPORTANCECurrently, no vaccines are available to prevent rickettsioses, while vector-borne rickettsial infections in humans are on the rise globally. In fact, the insufficient understanding of how pathogenic Rickettsia species circumvent host immune defense mechanisms has significantly hindered the development of more effective therapeutics. Here, we identified a previously unappreciated role for the Caspase-11-Gsdmd-IL-1 signaling axis, to limiting the replication of pathogenic R. rickettsia and R. typhi species in murine macrophages and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice. Adoptative transfer studies further identified IL-1-secreting macrophages as critical mediators in controlling rickettsial infection in WT mice. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the potential mechanism of how pathogenic, but not non-pathogenic Rickettsia spp., benefit from a reduction in the Caspase-11-Gsdmd-mediated release of IL-1 to support host colonization.",

This medicinal plant is effective against numerous infectious microbial and viral diseases and is used by many global communities as a source of artemisinin derivatives that are first-line drugs to treat malaria.\n\nAim of the StudyThe SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) global pandemic has killed millions and evolved numerous variants, with delta being the most transmissible to date and causing break-through infections of vaccinated individuals. We further queried the efficacy of A. annua cultivars against new variants.\n\nMaterials and MethodsUsing Vero E6 cells, we measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity of dried-leaf hot-water A. annua extracts of four cultivars, A3, BUR, MED, and SAM, to determine their efficacy against five fully infectious variants of the virus: alpha (B.1.1.7), beta (B.1.351), gamma (P.1), delta (B.1.617.2), and kappa (B.1.617.1).\n\nResultsIn addition to being effective against the original wild type WA1, A. annua cultivars A3, BUR, MED and SAM were also potent against all five variants. IC50 and IC90 values based on measured artemisinin content ranged from 0.3-8.4 M and 1.4-25.0 M, respectively. The IC50 and IC90 values based on dried leaf weight (DW) used to make the tea infusions ranged from 11.0-67.7 g DW and 59.5-160.6 g DW, respectively. Cell toxicity was insignificant at a leaf dry weight of [&le;]50 g in the extract of any cultivar.\n\nConclusionsResults suggest that oral consumption of A. annua hot-water extracts (tea infusions), could provide a cost-effective therapy to help stave off the rapid global spread of these variants, buying time for broader implementation of vaccines.",

However, the molecular mechanism(s) by which NFE2L1 regulates glycose and lipid metabolism is still elusive. Here, we found that the loss of NFE2L1 in human HepG2 cells led to a lethal phenotype upon glucose deprivation. The uptake of glucose was also affected by NFE2L1 deficiency. Further experiments unveiled that although the glycosylation of NFE2L1 was monitored through the glycolysis pathway, it enabled to sense the energy state and directly interacted with AMPK. These indicate that NFE2L1 can serve as a dual sensor and regulator of glucose homeostasis. In-depth sights into transcriptome, metabolome and seahorse data further unraveled that glucose metabolism was reprogrammed by disruption of NFE2L1, so as to aggravate the Warburg effect in NFE2L1-silenced hepatoma cells, along with the mitochondrial damage observed under the electron microscope. Collectively, these demonstrate that disfunction of NFE2L1 triggers the uncontrollable signaling by AMPK towards glucose metabolism reprogramming in the liver cancer development.",

    "abstract": "Stress defense and cell growth are inversely related in bulk culture analyses; however, these studies miss substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity, thus obscuring true phenotypic relationships. Here, we devised a microfluidics system to characterize multiple phenotypes in single yeast cells over time before, during, and after salt stress. The system measured cell and colony size, growth rate, and cell-cycle phase along with nuclear trans-localization of two transcription factors: stress-activated Msn2 that regulates defense genes and Dot6 that represses ribosome biogenesis genes during an active stress response. By tracking cells dynamically, we discovered unexpected discordance between Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that revealed subpopulations of cells with distinct growth properties. Surprisingly, post-stress growth recovery was positively corelated with activation of the Dot6 repressor. In contrast, cells lacking Dot6 displayed slower growth acclimation, even though they grow normally in the absence of stress. We show that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 response display faster production of Msn2-regulated Ctt1 protein, separable from the contribution of Msn2. These results are consistent with the model that transcriptional repression during acute stress in yeast provides a protective response, likely by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.",

Upon reaching the alveolar space, M.tb comes in close contact with the lung mucosa before and after its encounter with host alveolar compartment cells. Our previous studies show that homeostatic innate soluble components of the alveolar lining fluid (ALF) can quickly alter the cell envelope surface of M.tb upon contact, defining subsequent M.tb-host cell interactions and infection outcomes in vitro and in vivo. We also demonstrated that ALF from 60+ year old elders (E-ALF) vs. healthy 18- to 45-year-old adults (A-ALF) is dysfunctional with loss of homeostatic capacity and impaired innate soluble responses linked to high local oxidative stress. In this study, a targeted transcriptional assay demonstrates that M.tb exposure to human ALF alters the expression of its cell envelope genes. Specifically, our results indicate that A-ALF-exposed M.tb upregulates cell envelope genes associated with lipid, carbohydrate, and amino acid metabolism, as well as genes associated with redox homeostasis and transcriptional regulators. Conversely, M.tb exposure to E-ALF shows lesser transcriptional response, with most of the M.tb genes unchanged or downregulated. Overall, this study indicates that M.tb responds and adapts to the lung alveolar environment upon contact, and that the host ALF status determined by factors such as age might play an important role in determining infection outcome.",

    "abstract": "Progressive fibrogenesis in chronic liver injury is often associated with cancer development. Beta-arrestin-2 (ARRB2) is a regulator of the profibrotic Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1). The role of ARRB2 in liver fibrosis and in the transition from fibrosis to cancer is not fully understood and was investigated in this study.\n\nThis study demonstrates that upregulation of the retinoic acid receptor responder 1 (RARRES1) in HSC mediated by ARRB2 leads to fibrosis. This process is driven by exosomal ARRB2 transfer to HSC, major fibrosis contributors, from injured hepatocytes, which highly express ARRB2. By contrast, downregulation of RARRES1 in hepatocytes induces malignant transformation and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Consequently, Arrb2-deficient mice show higher number and size of liver tumors than wild-type mice in a hepatocellular carcinoma model with fibrosis. The identified relationship between ARRB2 and RARRES1 was observed in at least two species, including human cells and tissues in fibrosis and HCC and has a predictive value for survival in cancer patients. This study describes the discovery of a novel molecular pathway mediating the transition from fibrosis to cancer offering potential diagnostics and therapeutics.",

The method leverages an entirely random gRNA library and SpCas9-NG to randomly damage genomes in a controllable shotgun-like manner that then triggers diverse and abundant mutations via low-fidelity repair. As a proof-of-principle, CARM was applied to evolve the capacity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741 to produce {beta}-carotene. After seven rounds of iterative evolution over two months, a {beta}-carotene hyper-producing strain, C7-143, was isolated with a 10.5-fold increase in {beta}-carotene production and 857 diverse genomic mutants that comprised indels, duplications, inversions, and chromosomal rearrangements. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that the expression of 2,541 genes of strain C7-143 were significantly altered, suggesting that the metabolic landscape of the strain was deeply reconstructed. In addition, CARM was applied to evolve the industrially relevant Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK2-1C, the S-adenosyl-L-methionine production of which was increased to 2.28 times after just one round. Thus, CARM is a user-friendly and practical strategy for genetic remodeling and reverse engineering to investigate complicated organismal metabolism.",

Taiwan is regarded as part of this yeasts geographic birthplace where the most divergent natural lineage was discovered. Here, we deep sampled the broad-leaf forests across this continental island to probe the ancestral species diversity. We found that S. cerevisiae is distributed ubiquitously at low abundance in the forests. Whole-genome sequencing of 121 isolates revealed nine distinct lineages, the highest known in any region. Three lineages are endemic to Taiwan and six are widespread in Asia. Molecular dating placed the divergence of the Taiwanese and Asian lineages during the Pleistocene, when a transient continental shelf land bridge connected Taiwan to other major landmasses. Extensive historical and recent admixture events were detected between natural lineages. In particular, the genetic component from a lineage associated with fruits that spanned the widest geographical range was present in most admixed isolates. Collectively, Taiwanese isolates harbor genetic diversity comparable to that of the whole Asia continent, and different lineages have coexisted at a fine spatial scale even on the same tree. Patterns of variations within each lineage revealed that S. cerevisiae is highly clonal and predominantly reproduces asexually in nature. We detected prevalent purifying selection genome-wide, with lineage-specific signals of positive or directional selection independent between lineages. This study establishes that S. cerevisiae has rich natural diversity sheltered from human influences, making it a powerful model system in microbial ecology.",

Translation of CR to patients is complex, due to problems regarding adherence, feasibility and safety concerns in frail patients. Novel tailored dietary regimens, which modulate the dietary composition of macro- and micronutrients rather than reducing calorie intake promise similar protective effects and increased translatability. However, a direct head-to-head comparison to identify the most potent approach for organ protection as well as overlapping metabolic consequences has not been performed. We systematically analyzed six dietary preconditioning protocols - fasting mimicking diet (FMD), ketogenic diet (KD), dietary restriction of branched chained amino acids (BCAA), two dietary regimens restricting sulfur-containing amino acids (SR80/100) and CR - in a rodent model of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) to quantify diet-induced resilience in kidneys. Of the administered diets, FMD, SR80/100 and CR efficiently protect from kidney damage after IRI. Interestingly, these approaches show overlapping changes in oxidative and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)-dependent cysteine catabolism as a potential common mechanism of organ protection. Importantly, these metabolic changes can be recapitulated in patients preconditioned by a diet limiting sulfur-containing amino acids indicating conserved diet-induced mechanisms of stress-resistance that may ultimately lead to clinical application.",

The disease pathology of OA/PTOA is caused by imbalanced catabolic and anabolic responses and pro-inflammatory changes; however, their connection to pain is not well studied. Since IL-6 is involved in cartilage degradation and conditions of inflammatory pain, we set out to identify whether IL-6 and IL-6 signaling mechanisms contribute to both PTOA-associated cartilage degradation and pain. We performed a modified destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) surgery, a model of PTOA, on conventional IL-6 KO and control mice and assessed both cartilage degradation and pain-associated phenotypes. Genetic removal of Il6 in males attenuates PTOA-associated cartilage catabolism, decreases innervation of soft tissues associated with the knee joint, and reduces nociceptive pain signaling, without improving subchondral bone sclerosis or chondrocyte apoptosis. We further demonstrate that specific downstream mediators of IL-6 signaling, the Janus kinases (JAKs), are critical in regulating both cartilage catabolism and pain signaling. We identified STAT3 as a key regulator of cartilage catabolism downstream of JAK; however, inhibition of STAT3 decreases cartilage anabolism while enhancing pain signals. ERK was found to be important for neurite outgrowth and pain signaling; however, inhibition of ERK was less effective in reducing cartilage catabolism. Therefore, our data demonstrate that IL-6 mediates both PTOA-associated cartilage degradation and pain, and provides critical details regarding the downstream mediators of IL-6 signaling as therapeutic targets for disease-modifying osteoarthritis drugs.\n\nSingle Sentence Summary\n\nIL-6 mediates PTOA-associated cartilage degradation and pain via specific downstream signaling mechanisms in a gender specific manner.",

Basic knowledge of antimicrobial mechanism of action (MoA) is imperative for patient care and for identification of novel antimicrobials. However, the process of antimicrobial MoA identification is relatively laborious.

It uses a membrane dye and a nucleoid dye to track the morphological changes of single Bacillus subtilis cells in response to antimicrobials for up to 60 min. DBMI of bacterial cells facilitated assignment of the MoAs of 14 distinct, known antimicrobial compounds to the five main classes. Using this method, we found that the poorly studied antimicrobial, harzianic acid, a secondary metabolite that we purified from the fungal culture of Oidiodendron flavum, targets the cell envelope. We conclude that DBMI is a simple method, which facilitates rapid classification of the MoA of antimicrobials in functionally distinct classes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCyanobacterial blooms are one of the most common stress encountered by metazoans living in freshwater lentic systems such as lakes and ponds. Blooms reportedly impair fish health, notably through oxygen depletion and production of bioactive compounds including cyanotoxins. However, in the times of the \"microbiome revolution\", it is surprising that so little is still known regarding the influence of blooms on fish microbiota. In this study, an experimental approach is used to demonstrate that blooms affect fish microbiome composition and functions, as well as the metabolome of holobionts. To this end, the model teleost Oryzias latipes is exposed to simulated Microcystis aeruginosa blooms of various intensities in a microcosm setting, and the response of bacterial gut communities is evaluated in terms of composition, metagenome-encoded functions and metabolome profiling.\n\nResultsThe gut bacterial community of O. latipes exhibits marked responses to the presence of M. aeruginosa blooms in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, abundant gut-associated Firmicutes almost disappear, while potential opportunists increase. The holobionts gut metabolome displays major changes, while functions encoded in the metagenome of bacterial partners are more marginally affected. Bacterial communities tend to return to original composition after the end of the bloom suggesting post-bloom resilience, and remain sensitive in case of a second bloom, reflecting a highly reactive gut community.\n\nConclusionIn the context of increasingly frequent and intense blooms worldwide, results point to the relevance of accounting for short- and long-term microbiome-related effects in fish ecology, with potential outcomes relevant to conservation biology as well as aquaculture.",

    "abstract": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), continues to be a pressing health concern. In this study, we investigated the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on host microRNA (miRNA) populations in three human lung-derived cell lines, as well as in nasopharyngeal swabs from SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals. We did not detect any major and consistent differences in host miRNA levels after SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, we unexpectedly discovered a viral miRNA-like small RNA, named vmiR-5p (for viral miRNA), derived from the SARS-CoV-2 ORF7a transcript. Its abundance ranges from low to moderate as compared to host miRNAs. vmiR-5p functionally associates with Argonaute proteins -- core components of the RNA interference pathway -- leading to downregulation of host transcripts. One such host messenger RNA encodes Basic Leucine Zipper ATF-Like Transcription Factor 2 (BATF2), which is linked to interferon signaling. We demonstrate that vmiR-5p production relies on cellular machinery, yet is independent of Drosha protein, and is enhanced by the presence of a strong and evolutionarily conserved hairpin formed within the ORF7a sequence.\n\nSignificance statementWe discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) expresses a small viral non-coding RNA, named vmiR-5p (for viral miRNA), derived from the ORF7a transcript. vmiR-5p associates with the cellular RNA interference machinery to regulate host transcripts likely via target silencing. The production of vmiR-5p relies on cellular machinery and the formation of a strong hairpin within ORF7a sequences. This newly-described vmiR-5p may contribute to SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis and could become a target for therapeutic intervention.",

    "abstract": "In the parasite Trypanosoma brucei, the causative agent of human African sleeping sickness, all mRNAs are trans-spliced to generate a common 5 exon derived from the spliced leader RNA (SL RNA). Perturbations of protein translocation across the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) induce the spliced leader RNA silencing (SLS) pathway. SLS activation is mediated by a serine-threonine kinase, PK3, which translocates from the cytosolic face of the ER to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates the TATA binding protein TRF4, leading to the shut-off of SL RNA transcription, followed by induction of programmed cell death. Here, we demonstrate that SLS is also induced by depletion of the essential ER resident chaperones BiP and calreticulin, ER oxidoreductin 1 (ERO1), and the Golgi-localized quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase (QSOX1). Most strikingly, silencing of Rhomboid-like 1(TIMRHOM1) involved in mitochondrial protein import, also induces SLS. The PK3 kinase, which integrates SLS signals, is modified by phosphorylation on multiple sites. To determine which of the phosphorylation events activate PK3, several individual mutations or their combination were generated. These mutations failed to completely eliminate the phosphorylation or translocation of the kinase to the nucleus. The structure of PK3 kinase and its ATP binding domain were therefore modeled. A conserved phenylalanine at position 771 was proposed to interact with ATP, and the PK3F771L mutation completely eliminated phosphorylation under SLS, suggesting that the activation involves most if not all the phosphorylation sites. The study suggests that the SLS occurs broadly in response to failures in protein sorting, folding, or modification across multiple compartments.",

    "abstract": "Background & Aims2D monolayers of primary intestinal and colonic epithelial cells represent next-generation in vitro models of the gut. Efficient transgenesis and gene-editing in human intestinal stem cells (hISCs) would significantly improve utility of these models by enabling generation of reporter and loss/gain-of-function hISCs, but no published methods exist for transfecting 2D hISC monolayers. Electroporation has proven effective in other difficult-to-transfect cells; thus we applied this method to hISCs.\n\nMethodsTwenty-four electroporation parameters were tested, and the optimal condition for efficiency and viability was validated on hISCs from six anatomical regions along the small intestine and colon. PiggyBac transposase and Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes were used for stable genomic integration of reporter genes. High-throughput methods for clone isolation, expansion, and screening were developed. An hISC OLFM4-emGFP reporter was generated and validated by qPCR, organoid assays, and hISC compartmentalization on a planar crypt-microarray (PCM) device.\n\nResultsMaximum electroporation efficiency was 79.9% with a mean survival of 65%. Transfection of 105 hISCs produced [~]142 (0.14%) stable transposase-mediated clones. Transfection of OLFM4-targetting RNPs yielded [~]35% editing and 99/220 (45%) of antibiotic-resistant colonies analyzed expressed emGFP. OLFM4-emGFP hISCs applied to PCMs remained emGFP+ and proliferative in high-Wnt3a/R-spondin3/Noggin zones yet differentiated to emGFP-/KRT20+ cells outside engineered crypt zones. OLFM4-emGFP levels correlated with endogenous OLFM4. Olfm4-emGFPhigh cells were LGR5high/KRT20low, and demonstrated high organoid-forming potential.\n\nConclusionsElectroporation of hISCs is highly efficient for stable transgenesis and transgenic lines can be generated in 3-4 weeks. Workflows mirror conventional culture methods, facilitating rapid integration into established tissue-culture operations. OLFM4high is a robust hISC marker with functional properties in culture.",

In this work, we characterize Bhmt wildtype (WT) and knockout (KO) mice that were fully backcrossed to a C57Bl6/J background. Consistent with our previous findings, Bhmt KO mice had decreased body weight, fat mass and adipose tissue weight compared to WT. Histological analyses and gene expression profiling indicate that adipose browning was activated in KO mice and contributed to the adipose atrophy observed. BHMT is not expressed in adipose tissue but is abundant in liver, thus, a signal must be originating from the liver that modulates adipose tissue. We found that, in Bhmt KO mice, homocysteine-induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with activation of hepatic transcription factor cyclin AMP response element binding protein (CREBH), mediated an increase in hepatic and plasma concentrations of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), which is known to induce adipose browning. CREBH binds to the promoter regions of FGF21 to activate its expression. Taken together, our data indicate that deletion of a single gene in one-carbon metabolism modifies adipose biology and energy metabolism. It would be interesting to determine whether people with functional polymorphisms in BHMT exhibit a similar adipose atrophy phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte (CM) proliferation notably decreases during the perinatal period. At present, regulatory mechanisms for this loss of proliferative capacity is poorly understood. CBX7, a polycomb group (PcG) protein, regulates the cell cycle but its role in CM proliferation is unknown. Here, we report that CBX7 inhibits proliferation of perinatal CMs by controlling TARDBP/Rbm38 pathway. Gene expression profiling demonstrated that CBX7 expression in the heart was low during the prenatal period, abruptly increased during the perinatal period, and sustained constantly throughout the adulthood. CBX7, when overexpressed via adenoviral transduction in neonatal CMs, reduced proliferation and promoted multinucleation of the CMs. Mutant mice carrying targeted inhibition of CBX7 in CMs exhibited cardiomegaly with increased proliferation of CMs at postnatal stages. Mechanistically, CBX7 interacted with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TARDBP) and positively regulated its downstream target, RNA Binding Motif Protein 38 (RBM38). Rbm38 was upregulated in the postnatal hearts and overexpression of RBM38 reduced proliferation of neonatal CMs. Together, this study provides a novel insight into the role of CBX7 in regulation of CM proliferation during the perinatal period.",

    "abstract": "Many industrially relevant biotransformation in whole-cells are dependent on cofactors such as NADH or NADPH. Cofactor regeneration is an established approach for providing a cheap source of cofactors in support of the main biotransformation reaction in biocatalysis. In essence, cofactor regeneration uses a sacrificial substrate to help regenerate a cofactor consumed by the main biotransformation reaction. Enzymatic in nature, alternative cofactor regeneration systems with high efficiency and which utilises low cost sacrificial substrate are of interest. Glucose dehydrogenase system has been dominant in NADH regeneration. But, in its current incarnation, glucose dehydrogenase system is relatively inefficient in regenerating NADH with theoretical yield of one NADH per glucose molecule. This work sought to explore the utility of a two-gene ethanol utilisation pathway in NADH regeneration. Comprising the first step that takes ethanol to acetaldehyde, and a second step that converts acetaldehyde to acetyl-CoA, NADH from both steps could be mined for supporting biotransformation reaction in cofactor regeneration mode. Theoretically, ethanol utilisation pathway (EUP) affords a higher NADH yield of two NADH per ethanol molecule, and is therefore more efficient than glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) system. In this project, the EUP pathway was coupled to a cpsADH (an alcohol dehydrogenase from Candida parapsilosis) mediated ketone to alcohol anaerobic biotransformation with concentration of alcohol product as marker for efficiency of cofactor regeneration. Experiment tests showed that EUP was more efficient than GDH. Further, EUP could support biotransformation of both butanone and acetophenone in single and two-phase biotransformation, respectively. Additional work conducted to improve biotransformation efficiency revealed that ethanol provision positively correlated with biotransformation efficiency. Growing cell biotransformation was also found to improve biotransformation efficiency compared to resting cell due largely to the driving force generated by cell growth. Tests of a growth medium effect also found that cells cultivated in M9 ethanol medium delivered higher biotransformation efficiency compared to those cultivated in LB medium. This could arise due to the lower expression of NADH dependent enzymes during growth in M9 ethanol medium compared to LB medium that allowed more NADH to be diverted to support ketone biotransformation. However, a persistent problem with the experimental system is the relatively poor consumption of ethanol that points to need for further engineering of the system. Collectively, pathway-based NADH regeneration is possible with ethanol utilisation, with biotransformation efficiency dependent on mode of biotransformation (resting cell versus growing cell) and growth medium used.",

    "abstract": "Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are a commonly used tool in neuroscience to efficiently label, trace, and/or manipulate neuronal populations. Highly specific targeting can be achieved through recombinase-dependent AAVs in combination with transgenic rodent lines that express Cre-recombinase in specific cell types. Visualization of viral expression is typically achieved through fluorescent reporter proteins (e.g., GFP or mCherry) packaged within the AAV genome. Although non-amplified fluorescence is usually sufficient to observe viral expression, immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter is routinely used to improve viral visualization. In the present study, Cre-dependent AAVs were injected into the hippocampus and cortex of wild-type C57BL/6J mice. While we observed weak but consistent non-amplified off-target DIO expression in C57BL/6J mice, antibody amplification of the GFP or mCherry reporter revealed extensive Cre-independent viral expression. Off-target expression of DIO constructs in wild-type C57BL/6J mice occurred independent of vendor, AAV serotype or promoter. We also evaluated whether Cre-independent expression had functional effects via Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). The DREADD agonist C21 had no effect on contextual fear conditioning or cFos expression in DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry+ cells of C57BL/6J mice. Taken together, our results indicate that DIO constructs have considerable off-target expression in wild type subjects. Our findings are particularly important for the design of experiments featuring sensitive systems and/or quantitative measurements that could be negatively impacted by off-target expression.\n\nSignificance StatementAdeno-associated viruses (AAV) are widely used in neuroscience because of their safety and ease of use. Combined with specific promoters, Cre/loxP, and stereotaxic injections, highly specific targeting of cells and circuits within the brain can be achieved. In the present study we injected Cre-dependent AAVs into wild-type C57BL/6J mice and found considerable Cre-independent viral expression of AAVs encoding mCherry, GFP, or hM3Dq following immunohistochemical amplification of the fluorescent reporter protein. Importantly, we observed no functional effects of the Cre-independent expression in the hippocampus, as C21 had no detectable effect on DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry infected neurons in C57BL/6J mice. Given the widespread use of DIO rAAVs by the neuroscience community, our data supports careful consideration when using DIO constructs in control animals.",

Here we report that the epigenetic regulator SMCHD1 has a maternal effect on Hox gene expression and skeletal patterning. Maternal SMCHD1, present in the oocyte and preimplantation embryo, prevents precocious activation of Hox genes postimplantation. Without maternal SMCHD1, highly penetrant posterior homeotic transformations occur in the embryo. Hox genes are decorated with Polycomb marks H2AK119ub and H3K27me3 from the oocyte throughout early embryonic development; however, loss of maternal SMCHD1 does not alter these marks. Therefore, we propose maternal SMCHD1 acts downstream of Polycomb marks to establish a chromatin state necessary for persistent epigenetic silencing and appropriate Hox gene expression later in the developing embryo. This is a striking role for maternal SMCHD1 in long-lived epigenetic effects impacting offspring phenotype.",
