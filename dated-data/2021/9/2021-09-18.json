    "abstract": "Techniques to analyze and sort single cells based on functional outputs, such as secreted products, have the potential to transform our understanding of cellular biology, as well as accelerate the development of next generation cell and antibody therapies. However, secreted molecules rapidly diffuse away from cells, and analysis of these products requires specialized equipment and expertise to compartmentalize individual cells and capture their secretions. Herein we demonstrate the use of suspendable microcontainers to sort single viable cells based on their secreted products at high-throughput using only commonly accessible laboratory infrastructure. Our microparticles act as solid supports which facilitate cell attachment, partition uniform aqueous compartments, and capture secreted proteins. Using this platform, we demonstrate high-throughput screening of stably- and transiently-transfected producer cells based on relative IgG production as well as screening of B lymphocytes and hybridomas based on antigen-specific antibody production using commercially available flow sorters. Leveraging the high-speed sorting capabilities of standard sorters, we sorted >1,000,000 events in less than an hour. The reported microparticles can be easily stored, and distributed as a consumable reagent amongst researchers, democratizing access to high-throughput functional cell screening.",

    "abstract": "Foragers often compete for resources that ripen (or otherwise improve) gradually. What strategy is optimal in this situation? It turns out that there is no optimal strategy. There is no evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), and the only Nash equilibrium (NE) is unstable: strategies similar to the NE can always invade. But in spite of this instability, the NE is predictive. If harvesting attempts are costly or there are many competitors, the process tends to remain near the unstable NE. In this case, the resource often goes unharvested. Harvesting attempts--when they happen at all--usually occur when the resource is barely ripe enough to offset costs. The more foragers there are, the lower the chance that the resource will be harvested and the greater its mean value when harvested. This counterintuitive behavior is exhibited not only by theoretical models and computer simulations, but also by human subjects in an experimental game.",

    "abstract": "The size and density of stomatal pores limit the maximum rate of leaf carbon gain and water loss (gmax) in land plants. The limits of gmax due to anatomy, and its constraint by the negative correlation of stomatal size and density at broad phylogenetic scales, has been unclear and controversial. The prevailing hypothesis posits that adaptation to higher gmax is typically constrained by geometry and/or an economic need to reduce the allocation of epidermal area to stomata (stomatal-area minimization), and this would require the evolution of greater numbers of smaller stomata. Another view, supported by the data, is that across plant diversity, epidermal area allocated to guard cells versus other cells can be optimized without major trade-offs, and higher gmax would typically be achieved with a higher allocation of epidermal area to stomata (stomatal-area increase). We tested these hypotheses by comparing their predictions for the structure of the covariance of stomatal size and density across species, applying macroevolutionary models and phylogenetic regression to data for 2408 species of angiosperms, gymnosperms, and ferns from forests worldwide. The observed stomatal size-density scaling and covariance supported the stomatal-area increase hypothesis for high gmax. A higher gmax involves construction costs and maintenance costs that should be considered in models assessing optimal stomatal conductance for predictions of water use, photosynthesis, and water-use efficiency as influences on crop productivity or in Earth System models.",

    "abstract": "Flavonol synthase (FLS) is a key enzyme for the formation of flavonols, which are a subclass of the flavonoids. FLS catalyses the conversion of dihydroflavonols to flavonols. The enzyme belongs to the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (2-ODD) superfamily. We characterized the FLS gene family of Brassica napus that covers 13 genes, based on the genome sequence of the B. napus cultivar Express 617. The goal was to unravel which BnaFLS genes are relevant for seed flavonol accumulation in the amphidiploid species B. napus. Two BnaFLS1 homeologs were identified and shown to encode bifunctional enzymes. Both exhibit FLS activity as well as flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) activity, which was demonstrated in vivo and in planta. BnaFLS1-1 and -2 are capable of converting flavanones into dihydroflavonols and further into flavonols. Analysis of spatio-temporal transcription patterns revealed similar expression profiles of BnaFLS1 genes. Both are mainly expressed in reproductive organs and co-expressed with the genes encoding early steps of flavonoid biosynthesis. Our results provide novel insights into flavonol biosynthesis in B. napus and contribute information for breeding targets with the aim to modify the flavonol content in rapeseed.",

AlphaCryo4D integrates 3D deep residual learning with manifold embedding of energy landscapes, which simultaneously improves 3D classification accuracy and reconstruction resolution via an energy-based particle-voting algorithm. By applications of this approach to analyze five experimental datasets, we demonstrate its generality in breaking resolution barrier of visualizing dynamic components of functional complexes, in choreographing continuous inter-subunit motions and in exploring their  hidden conformational space.

    "abstract": "Scale invariant neural dynamics are a relatively new but effective means of measuring changes in brain states as a result of varied cognitive load and task difficulty. This study is the first to test whether scale invariance (as measured by the Hurst exponent, H) can be used with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to quantify cognitive load. We analyzed H extracted from the fNIRS time series while participants completed an N-back working memory task. Consistent with what has been demonstrated in fMRI, the current results showed that scale-invariance analysis significantly differentiated between task and rest periods as calculated from both oxy- (HbO) and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbR) concentration changes. Results from both channel-averaged H and a multivariate partial least squares approach (Task PLS) demonstrated higher H during the 1-back task than the 2-back task. These results were stronger for H derived from HbR than from HbO. As fNIRS is relatively portable and robust to motion-related artifacts, these preliminary results shed light on the promising future of measuring cognitive load in real life settings.\n\nAuthor SummaryScale invariance reflects a pattern of self-similarity (or fractalness) across a time series of brain data. In human neuroscience studies using EEG and fMRI, higher scale invariance has been associated with individuals being in a state of minimal cognitive effort or while performing a relatively easy task compared to doing something more challenging. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a flexible neuroimaging technique that can be used in naturalistic settings and measures the same underlying biological signal as fMRI. We expected that, if scale invariant brain states are indeed robust indicators of cognitive load or task difficulty, we should be able to replicate previous findings in fNIRS. Consistent with this hypothesis, we find that more scale invariant brain states are indeed associated with less cognitively demanding and more restful brain states in fNIRS data. This finding opens up a wide array of potential applications for monitoring cognitive load and fatigue in real-life settings, such as during driving, learning in schools, or during interpersonal interactions.",

    "abstract": "MotivationNonribosomal peptides are a class of secondary metabolites synthesized by multimodular enzymes named nonribosomal peptide synthetases and mainly produced by bacteria and fungi. It has been shown that non-ribosomal peptides have a huge structural and functional diversity including antimicrobial activity, therefore, they are of increasing interest for modern biotechnology. Methods such as NMR and LC-MS/MS allow to determine a peptide structure precisely, but it is often not a trivial task to find natural producers of them. Today, the search is usually performed manually, mostly with tools such as antiSMASH or Prism. However, there are cases when potential producers should be found among hundreds of strains, for instance, when analyzing metagenomes data. Thus, the development of automated approaches is a high-priority task for further nonribosomal peptides research.\n\nResultsWe developed BioCAT, a two-side approach to find biosynthetic gene clusters which may produce a given nonribosomal peptide when the structure of interesting nonribosomal peptide has already been found. Formally, BioCAT unites the antiSMASH software and the rBAN retrosynthesis tool but some improvements were added to both gene cluster and peptide chemical structure analyses. The main feature of the method is an implementation of position specific score matrix to store specificities of nonribosomal peptide synthetase modules, which has increased the alignment quality in comparison with more strict approaches developed earlier. An ensemble model was implemented to calculate the final alignment score. We tested the method on a manually curated nonribosomal peptides producers database and compared it with a competing tool called GARLIC. Finally, we showed the method applicability on several external examples.\n\nAvailabilityBioCAT is available on the GitHub repository or via pip\n\nContactkonanovdmitriy@gmail.com",

    "abstract": "The precursor of heme, protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), accumulates abundantly in the uterus of birds, such as Japanese quail, Coturnix japonica, resulting in brown-speckled eggshells. The molecular basis of PPIX production in the uterus remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the cause of low PPIX production in a classical Japanese quail mutant exhibiting white eggshells by comparing its gene expression in the uterus with that of the wild type using transcriptome analysis and performed genetic linkage mapping to identify the causative genomic region of the white eggshell phenotype. We showed that 11 genes, including the 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 1 (ALAS1) and ferroxidase hephaestin-like 1 (HEPHL1) genes, were specifically upregulated in the wild-type uterus and downregulated in the mutant. We mapped the 172 kb candidate genomic region on chromosome 6, which contains several genes, including a part of the paired-like homeodomain 3 (PITX3), which encodes a transcription factor. ALAS1, HEPHL1, and PITX3 were expressed in the apical cells of the luminal epithelium and lamina propria cells of the uterine mucosa of the wild-type quail, and their expression was downregulated in these cells of the mutant quail. Biochemical analysis using uterine homogenates indicated that the restricted availability of 5-aminolevulinic acid is the main cause of low PPIX production. These results suggest that uterus-specific transcriptional regulation of heme-biosynthesis-related genes is an evolutionarily acquired mechanism of eggshell pigment production in Japanese quail.",

    "abstract": "The cortex has a characteristic layout with specialized functional areas forming distributed large-scale networks. However, substantial work shows striking variation in this organization across people, which relates to differences in behavior. While a dominant assumption is that cortical  variants represent boundary shifts in the borders between regions, here we show that variants can also occur at a distance from their typical position, forming ectopic intrusions. Both forms of variants, border shifts and ectopic intrusions, are common across individuals, but the forms differ in their location, network associations, and activations during tasks. Although both forms of variation are heritable, border shift variants track significantly more with shared genetics than ectopic variants. Further, variant properties are categorically different between subgroups of individuals. Finally, exploratory evidence suggests that variants can be used to predict a small amount of variance in individual differences in behavior, but the two forms differ in which behavioral phenotypes they predict. This work argues that individual differences in brain organization commonly occur in two dissociable forms - border shifts and ectopic intrusions - that must be separately accounted for in the analysis of cortical systems across people. This work expands our knowledge of cortical variation in humans and helps reconceptualize the discussion of how cortical systems variability arises and links to individual differences in cognition and behavior.",

An unresolved question is the relative importance of new mutations, ancestral variants, and introgressive hybridization for phenotypic evolution and speciation. Here we address this issue using Darwins finches, which vary in size from an 8g warbler finch with a pointed beak to a 40g large ground finch with a massive blunt beak. We present a highly contiguous genome assembly for one of the species and investigate the genomic architecture underlying phenotypic diversity in the entire radiation. Admixture mapping for beak and body size in the small, medium and large ground finches revealed 28 loci showing strong genetic differentiation. These loci represent ancestral haplotype blocks with origins as old as the Darwins finch phylogeny (1-2 million years). Genes expressed in the developing beak are overrepresented in these genomic regions. Frequencies of allelic variants at the 28 loci covary with phenotypic similarities in body and beak size across the Darwins finch phylogeny. These ancestral haplotypes constitute genetic modules for selection, and act as key determinants of the exceptional phenotypic diversity of Darwins finches. Such ancestral haplotype blocks can be critical for how species adapt to environmental variability and change.",

    "abstract": "Transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are the adaptor molecules required for reading of the genetic code and the accurate production of proteins. tRNA variants can lead to genome-wide mistranslation, the misincorporation of amino acids not specified by the standard genetic code into nascent proteins. While genome sequencing has identified putative mistranslating tRNA variants in human populations, little is known regarding how mistranslation affects multicellular organisms. Here, we create a Drosophila melanogaster model for mistranslation by integrating a serine tRNA variant that mistranslates serine for proline (tRNASerUGG, G26A) into the fly genome. Using mass spectrometry, we find that tRNASerUGG, G26A misincorporates serine for proline at a frequency of [~] 0.6% per codon. We find that mistranslation extends development time and decreases the number of flies that reach adulthood. Adult flies containing tRNASerUGG, G26A present with more morphological deformities and worse climbing performance than flies expressing only wild type tRNA. Female flies with the serine tRNA variant have more deformities and experience a faster decline in climbing performance than males, suggesting sex-specific effects. This model will enable studies into the synergistic effects of mistranslating tRNA variants and disease-causing alleles.",

Defects ultimately lead to male sub-fertility or sterility, and numerous aspects of mammalian sperm formation remain unknown. The predominant expression of the latest globin family member, androglobin (Adgb) in mammalian testis tissue prompted us to assess its physiological function in spermatogenesis. Adgb knockout mice display male infertility, reduced testis weight, impaired maturation of elongating spermatids, abnormal sperm shape and ultrastructural defects in microtubule and mitochondrial organisation. Epididymal sperm from Adgb knockout animals display multiple flagellar malformations including coiled, bifide or shortened flagella, and erratic acrosomal development. Following immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, we could identify septin 10 (Sept10) as interactor of Adgb. The Sept10-Adgb interaction was confirmed both in vivo using testis lysates, and in vitro by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Furthermore, absence of Adgb leads to mislocalisation of Sept10 in sperm, indicating defective manchette and sperm annulus formation. Finally, in vitro data suggest that Adgb contributes to Sept10 proteolysis in a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent manner. Collectively, our results provide evidence that Adgb is essential for murine spermatogenesis and further suggest that interdependence between Adgb and Sept10 is required for sperm head shaping via the manchette and proper flagellum formation.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial gene expression is controlled at multiple levels, with chromosome supercoiling being one of the most global regulators. Global DNA supercoiling is maintained by the orchestrated action of topoisomerases. In Streptomyces, mycelial soil bacteria with a complex life cycle, topoisomerase I depletion led to elevated chromosome supercoiling, changed expression of significant fraction of genes, delayed growth and blocked sporulation. To identify supercoiling-induced sporulation regulators, we searched for S. coelicolor transposon mutants that were able to restore sporulation despite high chromosome supercoiling. We established that transposon insertion in genes encoding a novel two-component system named SatKR reversed the sporulation blockage resulting from topoisomerase I depletion. Transposition in satKR abolished the transcriptional induction of the genes within the so-called supercoiling-hypersensitive cluster (SHC). Moreover, we found that activated SatR also induced the same set of SHC genes under normal supercoiling conditions. We determined that the expression of genes in this region impacted S. coelicolor growth and sporulation. Interestingly, among the associated products is another two-component system (SitKR), indicating the potential for cascading regulatory effects driven by the SatKR and SitKR two-component systems. Thus, we demonstrated the concerted activity of chromosome supercoiling and a hierarchical two-component signalling system that impacts gene activity governing Streptomyces growth and sporulation.\n\nIMPORTANCEStreptomyces, soil bacteria with complex life cycle, are the producers of a broad range of biologically active compounds (e.g. antibiotics). Streptomyces respond to various environmental signals using complex transcriptional regulation mechanism. Understanding regulation of their gene expression is crucial for Streptomyces application as industrial organisms. Here, based on extensive transcriptomics analyses, we describe the concerted regulation of genes crucial for growth and development by global DNA supercoiling and novel two-component system. Our data indicate that regulated genes encode growth and sporulation regulator. Thus, we demonstrate that Streptomyces link the global regulatory strategies to adjusts life cycle to unfavourable conditions.",

    "abstract": "The high incidence of thrombotic events suggests a possible role of the contact system pathway in COVID-19 pathology. Here, we demonstrate altered levels of factor XII (FXII) and its activation products in two independent cohorts of critically ill COVID-19 patients in comparison to patients suffering from severe acute respiratory distress syndrome due to influenza virus (ARDS-influenza). Compatible with this data, we report rapid consumption of FXII in COVID-19, but not in ARDS-influenza, plasma. Interestingly, the kaolin clotting time was not prolonged in COVID-19 as compared to ARDS-influenza. Using confocal and electron microscopy, we show that increased FXII activation rate, in conjunction with elevated fibrinogen levels, triggers formation of fibrinolysis-resistant, compact clots with thin fibers and small pores in COVID-19. Accordingly, we observed clot lysis in 30% of COVID-19 patients and 84% of ARDS-influenza subjects. Analysis of lung tissue sections revealed wide-spread extra- and intra-vascular compact fibrin deposits in COVID-19. Together, our results indicate that elevated fibrinogen levels and increased FXII activation rate promote thrombosis and thrombolysis resistance via enhanced thrombus formation and stability in COVID-19.",

However, in domesticated species of the Capsicum genus hybrid breeding has lagged, in part due to a lack of detailed information about the phenotypic and metabolic consequences of hybridization. Here, we performed reciprocal crosses between four inbred varieties of two species of cultivated C. chinense (cv. Habanero and Biquinho) and C. annuum var. annuum (cv. Jalapeno and cv. Cascadura Ikeda). These varieties were specifically selected for their highly divergent traits, including plant growth habit, fruit size, shape and pungency: Habanero and Jalapeno peppers are highly pungent forms, particularly popular in Mexico. The Biquinho cultivar of C. chinense and the Cascadura Ikeda bell pepper are traditional sweet cultivars from Brazil. From the parental genotypes and from the progeny of the reciprocal crosses, we measured 28 phenotypic traits, including plant growth, and yield, 32 fruit shape parameters, and 50 fruit pericarp and placenta metabolites, including capsaicinoids. We found large differences for agronomic and metabolic traits between the genotypes, including heterosis for pungency and reciprocal effects for agronomic traits. We also show that the strong association between fruit shape and pungency can be broken in intraspecific hybrids, paving the way for the precision breeding of novel varieties.\n\nOnce sentence summaryHybrids of Capsicum peppers display heterosis and reciprocal effects for agronomic traits and fruit pungency",

    "abstract": "Generations of farmer selection have produced a unique collection of traditional maize varieties adapted to the environmental challenges of the central Mexican highlands. In addition to agronomic and cultural value, Mexican highland maize represents a good system for the study of local adaptation and acquisition of adaptive phenotypes under cultivation. In this study, we characterized a recombinant inbred line population derived from the cross of the B73 reference line and the Mexican highland maize variety Palomero Toluqueno. Evaluation over multiple years in lowland and highland field sites in Mexico identified genomic regions linked to yield components and putatively adaptive morphological traits. A region on chromosome 7 associated with ear weight showed antagonistic allelic effects in lowland and highland fields, suggesting a trade-off consistent with local adaptation. We identified several alleles of highland origin associated with characteristic highland traits, including reduced tassel branching, increased stem pigmentation and the presence of stem macrohairs. The oligogenic architecture of characteristic morphological traits supports their role in adaptation, suggesting they have arisen from consistent directional selection acting at distinct points across the genome. We discuss these results in the context of the origin of phenotypic novelty during selection, commenting on the role of de novo mutation and the acquisition of adaptive variation by gene flow from endemic wild relatives.",

    "abstract": "The  sensitive period for phonetic learning ([~]6-12 months) is one of the earliest milestones in language acquisition where infants start to become specialized in processing speech sounds in their native language. In the last decade, advancements in neuroimaging technologies for infants are starting to shed light on the underlying neural mechanisms supporting this important learning period. The current study reports on the largest longitudinal dataset to date with the aim to replicate and extend on two important questions: 1) what are the developmental changes during the  sensitive period for native and nonnative speech processing? 2) how does native and nonnative speech processing in infants predict later language outcomes? Fifty-four infants were recruited at 7 months of age and their neural processing of speech was measured using Magnetoencephalography (MEG). Specifically, the neural sensitivity to a native and a nonnative speech contrast was indexed by the mismatch response (MMR). They repeated the measurement again at 11 months of age and their language development was further tracked from 12 months to 30 months of age using the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (CDI). Using an a prior Region-of-Interest (ROI) approach, we observed significant increases for the Native MMR in the left inferior frontal region (IF) and superior temporal region (ST) from 7 to 11 months, but not for the Nonnative MMR. Complementary whole brain comparison revealed more widespread developmental changes for both contrasts. However, only individual differences in the left IF and ST for the Nonnative MMR at 11 months of age were significant predictors of individual vocabulary growth up to 30 months of age. An exploratory machine-learning based analysis further revealed that whole brain MMR for both Native and Nonnative contrasts can robustly predict later outcomes, but with very different underlying spatial-temporal patterns. The current study extends our current knowledge and suggests that native and nonnative speech processing may follow different developmental trajectories and utilize different mechanisms that are relevant for later language skills.",

At higher concentrations, in vitro, cofilin stabilizes a more flexible, hyper-twisted state of actin known as \"cofilactin\", but a structural role for cofilactin, in situ, has not been observed. Combining cryo-electron tomography and live-cell imaging in neuronal growth cones, we show that filopodial actin bundles can switch between a fascin-linked and a cofilin-decorated state, composed of hyper-twisted cofilactin filaments. These cofilactin bundles contribute to the flexibility of filopodial actin networks, thus regulating growth cone searching dynamics.

    "abstract": "The activity-dependent plasticity of synapses is believed to be the cellular basis of learning. These synaptic changes are mediated through the coordination of local biochemical reactions in synapses and changes in gene transcription in the nucleus to modulate neuronal circuits and behavior. The protein kinase C (PKC) family of isozymes has long been established as critical for synaptic plasticity. However, due to a lack of suitable isozyme-specific tools, the role of the novel subfamily of PKC isozymes is largely unknown. Here, through the development of FLIM-FRET activity sensors, we investigate novel PKC isozymes in synaptic plasticity in mouse CA1 pyramidal neurons. We find that PKC{delta} is activated downstream of TrkB and that the spatiotemporal nature of its activation depends on the plasticity stimulation. In response to single spine plasticity, PKC{delta} is activated primarily in the stimulated spine and is required for local expression of plasticity. However, in response to multi-spine stimulation, a long-lasting and spreading activation of PKC{delta} scales with the number of spines stimulated and, by regulating CREB activity, couples spine plasticity to transcription in the nucleus. Thus, PKC{delta} plays a dual functional role in facilitating synaptic plasticity.",

Upon genotoxic stress a nuclear p53-PI3,4,5P3 complex is generated in regions devoid of membranes by a nuclear PI3K, and this complex recruits all the kinases required to activate Akt and phosphorylate FOXOs, inhibiting DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Wild-type p53 activates nuclear Akt in an on/off fashion upon stress, whereas mutant p53 stimulates high basal Akt activity, indicating a fundamental difference. The nuclear p53-phosphoinositide signalosome is distinct from the canonical membrane-localized pathway and insensitive to PI3K inhibitors currently in the clinic, underscoring its therapeutic relevance.\n\nIn briefp53 assembles a PI3K-Akt pathway that regulates nuclear Akt activation independent of the canonical pathway on membranes.",

Here we study the transition from a weakly cross-linked network of actin filaments to a heavily cross-linked network of actin bundles through microscopic Brownian dynamics simulations. We show that this transition occurs in two stages: first, a composite bundle network of small and highly aligned bundles evolves from cross linking of individual filaments; second, small bundles coalesce into the clustered bundle state. We demonstrate that Brownian motion speeds up the first stage of this process at a faster rate than the second. We quantify the time to reach the composite bundle state and show that it is a strong function of mesh size only when the concentration of cross links is small, and that it remains roughly constant if we decrease the relative ratio of cross linkers as we increase the actin concentration. Finally, we examine the dependence of the bundling timescale on filament length, finding that shorter filaments bundle faster because they diffuse faster.",

    "abstract": "We employ model protocell networks for evaluation of molecular transport through lipid nanotubes as potential means of communication among primitive cells on the early Earth. Network formation is initiated by deposition of multilamellar lipid reservoirs onto a silicon oxide surface in an aqueous environment. These reservoirs autonomously develop into surface-adhered protocells interconnected via lipid nanotubes, and encapsulate solutes from the ambient buffer in the process. We prepare networks in the presence of DNA and RNA and observe encapsulation of these molecules, and their diffusive transport between the lipid compartments via the interconnecting nanotubes. By means of an analytical model we determine key physical parameters affecting the transport, such as nanotube diameter and compartment size. We conclude that nanotube-mediated transport in self-organized nanotube-vesicle networks could have been a possible pathway of chemical communication between primitive, self-assembled protocells under early earth conditions, circumventing the necessity for crossing the membrane barrier. We suggest this transport within a closed protocell network as a feasible means of RNA and DNA exchange under primitive prebiotic conditions, possibly facilitating early replication.",

To understand mechanisms of inflammation, animal models that reflect genetic diversity and clinical outcomes observed in humans are needed. We report a mouse panel comprising the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains crossed to human ACE2 transgenic mice (K18-hACE2) that confers susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. Infection of CC x K18- hACE2 resulted in a spectrum of survival, viral replication kinetics, and immune profiles. Importantly, in contrast to the K18-hACE2 model, early type I interferon (IFN-I) and regulated proinflammatory responses were required for control of SARS-CoV-2 replication in PWK x K18-hACE2 mice that were highly resistant to disease. Thus, virus dynamics and inflammation observed in COVID-19 can be modeled in diverse mouse strains that provide a genetically tractable platform for understanding anti-coronavirus immunity.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryGenetically diverse mice model a spectrum of clinically relevant innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

    "abstract": "Disulfiram is a 70-year-old anti-alcoholism drug, while copper(II) gluconate (Cu(Glu)2) is a commonly used food additive or copper supplement. Here we disclose that the combination of disulfiram and copper(II) gluconate drastically enhances the anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at the cellular level as compared to disulfiram or copper(II) gluconate alone. A 1:1 mixture of disulfiram and copper(II) gluconate shows an EC50 value of 154 nM against SARS-CoV-2 at the cellular level, much lower than the 17.45 M reported for disulfiram alone. Notably, previous clinical trials have shown that a combination of 250 mg disulfiram (0.843 mmol) and 8 mg copper(II) gluconate (0.0176 mmol) oral capsules per day is well tolerated (NCT03034135, NCT00742911).

    "abstract": "BackgroundCoronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; CoV2) is a deadly contagious infectious disease. For those who survived COVID-19, post-COVID cardiac damage poses a major threat for the progression of cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Currently, the number of COVID-related cases and deaths are increasing in Latin America, where a major COVID comorbidity is Chagas heart disease (caused by the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi). Here, we investigated the effect of T. cruzi infection on the pathogenesis and severity of CoV2 infection and, conversely, the effect of CoV2 infection on heart pathology during coinfection.\n\nMethodology/findingsWe used transgenic human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (huACE2) mice infected with CoV2, T. cruzi, or coinfected with both in this study. Our study shows for the first time that white adipose tissue (WAT) serves as a reservoir for CoV2 and the persistence of CoV2 in WAT alters adipose tissue morphology and adipocyte physiology. Our data demonstrate a correlation between the loss of fat cells and the pulmonary adipogenic signaling (via adiponectin isomers) and pathology in CoV2 infection. The viral load in the lungs is inversely proportional to the viral load in WAT, which differs between male and female mice. Our findings also suggest that adiponectin-PPAR signaling may differently regulate Chagas cardiomyopathy in coinfected males and females.\n\nConclusionWe conclude that adipogenic signaling may play important roles in cardio-pulmonary pathogenesis during CoV2 infection and T. cruzi coinfection. The levels of adiponectin isomers differ between male and female mice during CoV2 infection and coinfection with T. cruzi, which may differently regulate inflammation, viral load, and pathology in the lungs of both the sexes. Our findings are in line with other clinical observations that reported that males are more susceptible to COVID-19 than females and suffer greater pulmonary damage.",

    "abstract": "Animals differ in their appearances and behaviors. While many genetic studies have addressed the origins of phenotypic differences between fly species, we are still lacking a quantitative assessment of the variability in the way different fly species behave. We tackled this question in one of the most robust behaviors displayed by Drosophila: chemotaxis. At the larval stage, Drosophila melanogaster navigate odor gradients by combining four sensorimotor routines in a multilayered algorithm: a modulation of the overall locomotor speed and turn rate; a bias in turning during down-gradient motion; a bias in turning toward the gradient; the local curl of trajectories toward the gradient (\"weathervaning\"). Using high-resolution tracking and behavioral quantification, we characterized the olfactory behavior of eight closely related species of the Drosophila group in response to 19 ecologically-relevant odors. Significant changes are observed in the receptive field of each species, which is consistent with the rapid evolution of the peripheral olfactory system. Our results reveal substantial inter-species variability in the algorithms directing larval chemotaxis. While the basic sensorimotor routines are shared, their parametric arrangements can vary dramatically across species. The present analysis sets the stage for deciphering the evolutionary relationships between the structure and function of neural circuits directing orientation behaviors in Drosophila.",

Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a key pathological event in cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of adropin on ischemic stroke outcomes remain unexplored. Hypothesizing that adropin exerts neuroprotective effects by maintaining BBB integrity, we investigated the role of adropin in stroke pathology utilizing loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches combined with pharmacological treatment with synthetic adropin peptide. Stroke decreased endogenous adropin levels in the brain and plasma. Adropin treatment or transgenic adropin overexpression robustly reduced brain injury and improved long-term sensorimotor and cognitive function in young and aged mice subjected to ischemic stroke. In contrast, genetic deletion of adropin exacerbated ischemic brain injury. Mechanistically, adropin neuroprotection depends on endothelial nitric oxide synthase and is associated with reduced BBB permeability and neuroinflammation. We identify adropin as a novel neuroprotective peptide with the potential to improve stroke outcomes.",

In neutropenic hematopoietic cell transplant patients (n=119), 63 (53%) developed a subsequent fever and had increased fecal Akkermansia muciniphila, a mucus-degrading bacteria (p=0.006, corrected for multiple comparisons).\n\nIn mouse models, two therapies, irradiation and melphalan, similarly expanded A. muciniphila. Dietary restriction of unirradiated mice also expanded A. muciniphila and thinned the colonic mucus layer. Azithromycin treatment depleted A. muciniphila and preserved colonic mucus.\n\nDietary restriction raised colonic luminal pH and reduced acetate, propionate, and butyrate. Culturing A. muciniphila with lower pH and increased propionate prevented utilization of mucin. Treating irradiated mice with azithromycin or propionate preserved the mucus layer, lessened hypothermia, and reduced inflammatory cytokines in the colon. These results suggest that diet, metabolites and colonic mucus link the microbiome to neutropenic fever, and could guide future microbiome-based preventive strategies.",

    "abstract": "Human population and activities play an important role in dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. This study investigated the relationship between carriage rates of critically important antimicrobial-resistant (CIA-R) Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae by Silver Gulls and their proximity to human populations. Faecal swabs (n=229) were collected from Silver Gulls across 10 southern coastline locations in Western Australia (WA). The sampling locations included main town centres and remote areas. Fluoroquinolone and extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were isolated and tested for antimicrobial sensitivity. Genome sequencing was performed to validate phenotypic resistance profiles and determine the molecular characteristics of strains. CIA-R E. coli and K. pneumoniae were detected in 69 (30.1%) and 20 (8.73%) of the faecal swabs respectively. Two large urban locations tested positive for CIA-R E. coli (frequency ranging from 34.3%-84.3%), and/or for CIA-R K. pneumoniae (frequency ranging from 12.5%-50.0%). A small number of CIA-R E. coli (3/31, 9.7%) were identified at a small tourist town, but no CIA-R bacteria were recovered from gulls at remote sites. Commonly detected E. coli sequence types (STs) included ST131 (12.5%) and ST1193 (10.0%), and five K. pneumoniae STs were found. Resistance genes including blaCTX-M-3, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-27 were identified in both bacterial species. High-level colonisation of CIA-R E. coli and K. pneumoniae in Silver Gulls in and around urban areas compared to remote locations substantiates that anthropogenic activities are strongly associated with acquisition of resistant bacteria by gulls.\n\nImportanceHumans play an important role in dissemination of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. This study investigated the relationship between carriage rates of resistant bacterial pathogens (Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae) among Silver Gulls and their proximity to human populations. The frequency of resistant E. coli carriage was high (ranging from 34.3 - 84.3%) in the samples collected from areas with high human population density while resistant K. pneumoniae frequencies at these sites varied from 0 to 50%. However, resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae were not recovered from any of the remote sites that did not have a permanent human population. This study, conducted across a large stretch of the southwestern Australian coastline, indicated that seagulls act as vectors in carrying and disseminating antimicrobial resistant bacteria, including clinically significant strains. High-level colonisation of resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae in Silver Gulls in and around urban areas compared to remote locations substantiates that human activities are strongly associated with acquisition of resistant bacteria by Silver gulls.",

The development of new data resources can accelerate research in such animals. Here, we present new functional genomic resources for the amphipod crustacean Parhyale hawaiensis, facilitating the exploration of gene regulatory evolution using this emerging research organism. We use Omni-ATAC-Seq, an improved form of the Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin coupled with next-generation sequencing (ATAC-Seq), to identify accessible chromatin genome-wide across a broad time course of Parhyale embryonic development. This time course encompasses many major morphological events, including segmentation, body regionalization, gut morphogenesis, and limb development. In addition, we use short- and long-read RNA-Seq to generate an improved Parhyale genome annotation, enabling deeper classification of identified regulatory elements. We discover differential accessibility, predict nucleosome positioning, infer transcription factor binding, cluster peaks based on accessibility dynamics, classify biological functions, and correlate gene expression with accessibility. Using a Minos transposase reporter system, we demonstrate the potential to identify novel regulatory elements using this approach, including distal regulatory elements.

    "abstract": "Programmed cell death (PCD) plays a critical role in the development and maturation of the cochlea. Significant remodeling occurs among cells of the greater epithelial ridge (GER) of Kollikers organ, leading to tissue regression and formation of the inner sulcus. In mice, this event normally occurs between postnatal days 5-15 (P5-15) and is regulated by thyroid hormone (T3). During this developmental time period, the cochlea also contains a large population of macrophages. Macrophages are frequently involved in the phagocytic clearance of dead cells, both during development and after injury, but the role of macrophages in the developing cochlea is unknown. This study examined the link between developmental cell death in the GER and the recruitment of macrophages into this region. Cell death in the basal GER begins at P5 and enhanced numbers of macrophages were observed at P7. This pattern of macrophage recruitment was unchanged in mice that were genetically deficient for CX3CR1, the receptor for fractalkine (a known macrophage chemoattractant). We found that injection of T3 at P0 and P1 caused GER cell death to begin at P3, and this premature PCD was accompanied by earlier recruitment of macrophages. We further found that depletion of macrophages from the developing cochlea (using CX3CR1DTR/+ mice and treatment with the CSF1R antagonist BLZ945) had no effects on the pattern of GER regression. Together, these findings suggest that macrophages are recruited into the GER region after initiation of developmental PCD, but that they are not essential for GER regression during cochlear remodeling.",

    "abstract": "Inner-ear sensory hair cells convert mechanical stimuli from sound and head movements into electrical signals during mechanotransduction. Identification of all molecular components of the inner-ear mechanotransduction apparatus is ongoing; however, there is strong evidence that TMC1 and TMC2 are pore-forming subunits of the complex. We present molecular dynamics simulations that probe ion conduction of TMC1 models built based on two different structures of related TMEM16 proteins. Unlike most channels, the TMC1 models do not show a central pore. Instead, simulations of these models in a membrane environment at various voltages reveal a peripheral permeation pathway that is exposed to lipids and that shows cation permeation at rates comparable to those measured in hair cells. Furthermore, our analyses suggest that TMC1 gating mechanisms involve protein conformational changes and tension-induced lipid-mediated pore widening. These results provide insights into ion conduction and activation mechanisms of hair-cell mechanotransduction channels essential for hearing and balance.",

    "abstract": "We have previously identified sphingolipid metabolism as a key intracellular process associated with immunogenic cell death (ICD) induced by mitoxantrone in colon cancer cells. Specifically, we have demonstrated that inhibition of the sphingosine kinases (SphKs) synergistically enhanced production of hallmarks of ICD including ectoCRT production. To better understand the mechanism associated with ICD enhanced by SphK1-inhibition, we focused on the ER stress-associated intracellular signaling pathways leading to ectoCRT production. It is known that ABT-263 and AZD-5991 (ABT/AZD) are inhibitors of Bcl-2/Bcl-XL and MCL-1, respectively, leading to activation of Bak/Bax. Herein, we now provide evidence that treatment of DLD-1 colon cancer cells with ABT/AZD results in the production of ectoCRT indicative of ICD. Additionally, our data show that ABT/AZD-induced ectoCRT production is significantly enhanced by combination treatment with the SphK1 inhibitor, PF-543. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that combined treatment of ABT/AZD+PF-543 induces ectoCRT exposure in a caspase 8-dependent manner. Accordingly, we have identified a Bak/Bax activation-dependent pathway that leads to activation of a pro-survival SphK1/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling that attenuates ectoCRT production. Additionally, we have identified a regulatory role of ceramide synthase 6 (CerS6)- C16:0 Cer in transporting of dimeric CRT to the cell surface (ectoCRT). Together, these results indicate that sphingolipid metabolites, such as S1P and C16:0 Cer, have a key regulatory role for survival/death decisions of cancer cells in response to ICD-inducing chemotherapeutic agents such as mitoxantrone and ABT/AZD. Hence, targeting SphKs may be an innovative means to enhance the efficacy of ICD-inducing chemotherapeutic agents promoting anti-tumor innate/adaptive immune response since SphK inhibition blocks the anti-ICD effects of S1P while simultaneously accumulating sphingosine (Sph) leading to pro-ICD C16:0 Cer synthesis.",

    "abstract": "Sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) are products of joint DNA molecule resolution, and are considered to form through homologous recombination (HR). Indeed, upon generation of irradiation-induced DNA breaks, SCE induction was compromised in cells deficient for canonical HR factors BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51. Contrarily, replication-blocking agents, including PARP inhibitors, induced SCEs independently of BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51. PARP inhibitor-induced SCEs were enriched at common fragile sites (CFSs), and were accompanied by post-replicative single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) gaps. Moreover, PARP inhibitor-induced replication lesions were transmitted into mitosis, suggesting that SCEs originate from mitotic processing of under-replicated DNA. We found that DNA polymerase theta (POLQ) was recruited to mitotic DNA lesions, and loss of POLQ resulted in reduced SCE numbers and severe chromosome fragmentation upon PARP inhibition in HR-deficient cells. Combined, our data show that PARP inhibition generates under-replicated DNA, which is transferred into mitosis and processed into SCEs, independently of canonical HR factors.",

    "abstract": "1Modern scientific enterprises are often highly complex and multidisciplinary, particularly in areas like synthetic biology where the subject at hand is itself inherently complex and multidisciplinary. Collaboration across many organizations is necessary to efficiently tackle such problems [6, 15], but remains difficult. The challenge is further amplified by automation that increases the pace at which new information can be produced, and particularly so for matters of fundamental research, where concepts and definitions are inherently fluid and may rapidly change as an investigation evolves [7].\n\nThe DARPA program Synergistic Discovery and Design (SD2) aimed to address these challenges by organizing the development of data-driven methods to accelerate discovery and improve design robustness, with one of the key domains under study being synthetic biology. The program was specifically organized such that teams provided complementary types of expertise and resources, and without any team being in a dominant organizational position, such that subject-matter investigations would necessarily require peer-level collaboration across multiple team boundaries. With more than 100 researchers across more than 20 organizations, several of which ran experimental facilities with high-throughput automation, participants were forced to confront challenges around effective data sharing.\n\nThe default architecture for scientific collaboration is essentially one of anarchy, with ad-hoc bilateral relations between pairs of collaborators or experimental phases (Figure 1(a)). This was by necessity the case during early phases of the SD2 program as well, in which incorporating new tools into pipelines was ad-hoc and time-consuming, and data was generally disconnected from genetic designs and experimental plans. The other typical approach for collaboration is one of \"command and control\", in which a dominant organization determines the data sharing content and format for all participants (Figure 1(b)). This can be efficient, but tends to be limited in flexibility and extensibility, rendering it unsuitable for research collaboration, as indeed was found when we attempted this approach during the first year of the SD2 program. We addressed these problems with the application of distributed standards to create a \"flexible rendezvous\" model of collaboration (Figure 1(c)), enabling information flow to track evolving collaborative relationships, improving the sharing and utility of information across the community and supporting accelerated rates of experimentation.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=71 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/460644v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (15K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fc7371org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ff2733org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@66af53org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1809640_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1:C_FLOATNO Architectures for data sharing: bilateral relations (a), command and control (b), and flexible rendezvous (c).\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Laughter is a contagious prosocial signal that conveys bonding motivation; adult crying conversely communicates desire for social proximity by signalling distress. Endogenous mu-opioid receptors (MORs) modulate sociability in humans and non-human primates. In this combined PET-fMRI study (n=17) we tested whether central MOR tone is associated with regional brain responses to social signals of laughter and crying sounds. MOR availability was measured with positron emission tomography using high-affinity agonist radioligand [11C]carfentanil. Haemodynamic responses to social laughter and crying sounds were measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Social laughter evoked activation in the auditory cortex, insula, cingulate cortex, amygdala, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortex; crying sounds led to more restricted activation in auditory cortex and nearby areas. MOR availability was negatively correlated with the haemodynamic responses to social laughter in primary and secondary somatosensory cortex, primary and secondary motor cortex, posterior insula, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, cuneus, temporal gyri, and lingual gyrus. For crying-evoked activations, MOR availability was negatively correlated with medial and lateral prefrontal haemodynamic responses. Altogether our findings highlight the role of MOR system in modulating acute brain responses to both positive and negative social signals.",

    "abstract": "As neurons establish extensive connections throughout the central nervous system, the transport of cargo along the microtubule network of the axon is crucial for differentiation and homeostasis. Specifically, building blocks such as membrane and cytoskeletal components, organelles, transmembrane receptors, adhesion molecules, and peptide neurotransmitters all require proper transport to the presynaptic compartment. Here, we identify a novel complex regulating vesicular endoplasmic reticulum transport in neurites, composed of CLN6: an ER-associated protein of relatively unknown function implicated in CLN6-Batten disease; CRMP2: a tubulin binding protein important in regulating neurite microtubule dynamics; and KLC4: a classic transport motor protein. We show that this \"CCK\" complex allows ER-derived vesicles to migrate to the distal end of the axon, aiding in proper neurite outgrowth and arborization. In the absence of CLN6, the CCK complex does not function effectively, leading to reduced vesicular transport, stunted neurite outgrowth, and deficits in CRMP2 binding to other protein partners. Treatment with a CRMP2 modulating compound, lanthionine ketimine ester, partially restores these deficits in CLN6-deficient mouse neurons, indicating that stabilization of CRMP2 interacting partners may prove beneficial in lieu of complete restoration of the CCK complex. Taken together, these findings reveal a novel mechanism of ER-derived vesicle transport in the axon and provide new insights into therapeutic targets for neurodegenerative disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundDefining the cellular mechanisms that drive Alzheimers disease (AD) pathogenesis and progression will be aided by studies defining how gene expression patterns change during pre-symptomatic AD and the ensuing periods of steadily declining cognition. Previous studies have emphasized changes in transcriptional regulation, but not translational regulation, leaving the ultimate results of gene expression alterations relatively unexplored in the context of AD.\n\nObjectiveTo identify genes whose expression might be regulated at the transcriptional, and especially at the translational levels in AD, we analyzed gene expression in cerebral cortex of two AD model mouse strains, CVN (APPSwDI;NOS2-/-) and Tg2576 (APPSw), and their companion wild type (WT) strains at 6 months of age by tandem RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq (ribosome profiling).\n\nMethodsIdentical starting pools of bulk RNA were used for RNA-Seq and Ribo-Seq. Differential gene expression analysis was performed at the transcriptional and translational levels separately, and also at the translational efficiency level. Regulated genes were functionally evaluated by gene ontology tools.\n\nResultsCompared to WT mice, AD model mice had similar levels of transcriptional regulation, but displayed differences in translational regulation. A specific microglial signature associated with early stages of A{beta} accumulation was up-regulated at both transcriptome and translatome levels in CVN mice. Although the two mice strains did not share many regulated genes, they showed common regulated pathways related to APP metabolism associated with neurotoxicity and neuroprotection.\n\nConclusionThis work represents the first genome-wide study of brain translational regulation in animal models of AD, and provides evidence of a tight and early translational regulation of gene expression controlling the balance between neuroprotective and neurodegenerative processes in brain.",

    "abstract": "The NLRP3 inflammasome is a central component of the innate immune system. Its activation leads to the formation of a supramolecular assembly of the inflammasome adaptor protein ASC, commonly referred to as the \"ASC speck\". Different models of the overall structure of the ASC speck, as well as the entire NLRP3 inflammasome, have been reported in the literature. While many experiments involve overexpression or in vitro reconstitution of recombinant ASC, the cytoplasmic endogenous ASC speck remains difficult to study due to its relatively small size and structural variability.\n\nHere, we use a combination of fluorescence imaging techniques including dual-color 3D super-resolution imaging (dSTORM and DNA-PAINT) to visualize the endogenous ASC speck following NLRP3 inflammasome activation. We observe that the complex varies in diameter between [~]800 and 1000 nm and is composed of a dense core from which filaments extend into the periphery. We used a combination of anti-ASC antibodies as well as much smaller nanobodies for labeling, and find that the larger antibodies reliably label the lower-density periphery whereas the nanobody, which has a lower binding affinity, is more efficient in labeling the dense core. Imaging whole cells using dSTORM, furthermore, allowed us to sort the imaged structures into a pseudo-time sequence suggesting that the endogenous ASC speck becomes denser but not much larger during its formation. The reported results add an important piece of information towards a comprehensive understanding of the supramolecular structure of the endogenous inflammasome complex.\n\nSignificanceThe assembly of ASC into a supramolecular complex referred to as the ASC speck is a critical step in the NLRP3 inflammasome response. Despite significance research, the organization and formation of the endogenous ASC speck remain elusive. We used a combination of differently sized ASC labels with super-resolution microscopy to address the organization of the ASC speck at the nanoscale. Our results allow inference of the supramolecular structure of the unperturbed, endogenous speck and characterize how it changes during ASC recruitment. We find that the complex varies in size and is composed of a dense core from which filaments extend into the periphery. Notably, our results further indicate that during inflammasome formation, ASC specks become denser but only slightly larger.",

Immunofluorescence microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) captured images of infected HeLa cells and were analyzed using the image analysis program ImageJ. Results indicate that GBS causes HeLa cell detachment unless L. rhamnosus is present.

L. rhamnosus partially inhibits GBS-dependent microvilli and vesicle disruption. GBS also disrupts HeLa cell F-actin fibers unless L. rhamnosus is present.

    "abstract": "Gastrulation movements in all animal embryos start with regulated deformations of patterned epithelial sheets. Current studies of gastrulation use a wide range of model organisms and emphasize either large-scale tissue processes or dynamics of individual cells and cell groups 1,2,11-13,3-10. Here we take a step towards bridging these complementary strategies and deconstruct early stages of gastrulation in the entire Drosophila embryo, where transcriptional patterns in the blastoderm give rise to region-specific cell behaviors. Our approach relies on an integrated computational framework for cell segmentation and tracking and on efficient algorithms for event detection. Our results reveal how thousands of cell shape changes, divisions, and intercalations drive large-scale deformations of the patterned blastoderm, setting the stage for systems-level dissection of a pivotal step in animal development.",

    "abstract": "We recently mapped a genetic susceptibility locus on chromosome 6q22.33 for type 1 diabetes diagnosed below age of 7 years near the gene Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type K (PTPRK) and the thymocyte selection associated gene (THEMIS). As the thymus plays a central role in shaping the T cell repertoire, we aimed to identify the most likely causal genetic factors behind the association using thymocyte genomic data. In four thymocyte populations we identified 253 DNA sequence motifs underlying histone modifications. The G insertion allele of rs138300818, associated with protection from diabetes, created thymocyte motifs for multiple histone modifications and thymocyte types. The insertion also disrupted a predicted RFX5/7 transcription factor binding site. RFX7 is abundantly expressed in thymus. Chromatin state and RNA sequencing data suggested strong transcription overlapping rs138300818 in fetal thymus, while eQTL and chromatin conformation data indicated that the rs138300818 insertion is associated with lower THEMIS expression. Taken together, our results support a role for thymic THEMIS gene expression and the rs138300818 variant in promoting the development and diagnosis of type 1 diabetes at an earlier age.",

    "abstract": "The invasive Japanese stiltgrass (Microstegium vimineum) affects a wide range of ecosystems and threatens biodiversity across the eastern USA. However, the mechanisms underlying rapid adaptation, plasticity, and epigenetics in the invasive range are largely unknown. We present a chromosome-level assembly for M. vimineum to investigate genome dynamics, evolution, adaptation, and the genomics of phenotypic plasticity. We generated a 1.12 Gb genome with scaffold N50 length of 53.44 Mb respectively, taking a de novo assembly approach that combined PacBio and Dovetail Genomics Omni-C sequencing. The assembly contains 23 pseudochromosomes, representing 99.96% of the genome. BUSCO assessment indicated that 80.3% of Poales gene groups are present in the assembly. The genome is predicted to contain 39,604 protein-coding genes, of which 26,288 are functionally annotated. Furthermore, 66.68% of the genome is repetitive, of which unclassified (35.63%) and long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (26.90%) are predominant. Similar to other grasses, Gypsy (41.07%) and Copia (32%) are the most abundant LTR-retrotransposon families. The majority of LTR-retrotransposons are derived from a significant expansion in the past 1-2 million years, suggesting the presence of relatively young LTR-retrotransposon lineages. We find corroborating evidence from Ks plots for a stiltgrass-specific duplication event, distinct from the more ancient grass-specific duplication event. The assembly and annotation of M. vimineum will serve as an essential genomic resource facilitating studies of the invasion process, the history and consequences of polyploidy in grasses, and provides a crucial tool for natural resource managers.\n\nSignificanceThe current lack of genomic resources for the invasive Japanese stiltgrass--and thousands of other invasive species globally--severely limits our understanding of the invasion process and hinders decision-making for effective management and control. In this study, we present a chromosome-level genome assembly and annotation of Japanese stiltgrass, a problematic weed in eastern North America, identifying a clear history of polyploidy and recent activity of transposable elements. The ultimate goal is to advance genomic studies to better understand the dynamics of non-native species during the various invasion phases, thereby providing insights into effective control strategies to manage current and future invasions.",

    "abstract": "Chitin is a biopolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine with {beta}-1,4-bond and is the main component of arthropod exoskeletons and the cell walls of many fungi. Chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes the {beta}-1,4-bond in chitin and degrades chitin into oligomers. It has been found in a wide range of organisms. Chitinase from Gazyumaru (Ficus microcarpa) latex exhibits antifungal activity by degrading chitin in the cell wall of fungi and is expected to be used in medical and agricultural fields. However, the enzymes thermostability is an important factor; chitinase is not thermostable enough to maintain its activity under the actual applicable conditions. We solved the crystal structure of chitinase to explore the target sites to improve its thermostability. Based on the crystal structure and sequence alignment among other chitinases, we rationally introduced proline residues, a disulfide bond, and salt bridge in the chitinase using protein engineering methods. As a result, we successfully constructed the thermostable mutant chitinases rationally with high antifungal and specific activities. The results provide a useful strategy to enhance the thermostability of this enzyme family.\n\nIMPORTANCEWe solved the crystal structure of the chitinase from Gazyumaru (Ficus microcarpa) latex exhibiting antifungal activity. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the thermostable mutant enzyme with a melting temperature (Tm) 6.9 {degrees}C higher than wild type (WT) and a half-life at 60{degrees}C that is 15 times longer than WT was constructed through 10 amino acid substitutions, including five proline residues substitutions, making disulfide bonding, and building a salt bridge network in the enzyme. These mutations do not affect its high antifungal activity and chitinase activity, and the principle for the construction of the thermostable chitinase was well explained by its crystal structure. Our results provide a useful strategy to enhance the thermostability of this enzyme family and to use the thermostable mutant as a seed for antifungal agents for practical use.",

    "abstract": "Healthcare professionals and scientists utilize tumor shrinkage as a key metric to establish the efficacy of cancer treatments. However, current measurement tools such as CT scanners and calipers only provide brief snapshots of the dynamic geometric changes occurring in vivo, and they are unable to characterize the continuous micrometer-scale volumetric transformations transpiring at minute timescales. Here we present a stretchable electronic strain sensor, with a 10-micron scale resolution, capable of continuously monitoring tumor volume progression in real-time. In mouse models with subcutaneously implanted lung cancer or B-cell lymphoma tumors our sensors discerned a significant change in the tumor volumes of treated mice within 5 hours after small molecule therapy or immunotherapy initiation. Histology, caliper measurements, and luminescence imaging over a one-week treatment period validated the data from the continuous sensor. We anticipate that real-time tumor progression datasets could help expedite and automate the process of screening cancer therapies in vivo.",

    "abstract": "CUX2 gene encodes a transcription factor that controls neuronal proliferation, dendrite branching and synapse formation, locating at the epilepsy-associated chromosomal region 12q24 that we previously identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in Japanese population. A CUX2 recurrent de novo variant p.E590K has been described in patients with rare epileptic encephalopathies and the gene is a candidate for the locus, however the mutation may not be enough to generate the genome-wide significance in the GWAS and whether CUX2 variants appear in other types of epilepsies and physiopathological mechanisms are remained to be investigated. Here in this study, we conducted targeted sequencings of CUX2, a paralog CUX1 and its short isoform CASP harboring a unique C-terminus on 271 Japanese patients with a variety of epilepsies, and found that multiple CUX2 missense variants, other than the p.E590K, and some CASP variants including a deletion, predominantly appeared in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). The CUX2 variants showed abnormal localization in human cell culture analysis. While wild-type CUX2 enhances dendritic arborization in fly neurons, the effect was compromised by some of the variants. Cux2- and Casp-specific knockout mice both showed high susceptibility to kainate, increased excitatory cell number in the entorhinal cortex, and significant enhancement in glutamatergic synaptic transmission to the hippocampus. CASP and CUX2 proteins physiologically bound to each other and co-expressed in excitatory neurons in brain regions including the entorhinal cortex. These results suggest that CUX2 and CASP variants contribute to the TLE pathology through a facilitation of excitatory synaptic transmission from entorhinal cortex to hippocampus.",
