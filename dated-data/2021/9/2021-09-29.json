    "abstract": "In this paper, we used in silico analysis to shed light on the possible interaction between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV2 spike (S) protein by examining the role of TMPRSS2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation with susceptibility and inter-individual variability of SARS-CoV2 infection. First, we used molecular docking of human TMPRSS2 protein to predict the binding site of TMPRSS2, especially the TMPRSS2 link loops, in order to assess the effect TMPRSS2 SNPs. The latter lead to missense variants on the interaction between TMPRSS2 and SARS-CoV2 S protein. In a second step, we further refine our analysis by performing a structure-function analysis of the complexes using PyMol software, and finally by MD simulations to validate the as-obtained results. Our findings show that 17 SNPs among the 692 natural TMPRSS2 coding variants are in positions to influence the binding of TMPRSS2 with the viral S protein. All of them give more important interaction energy as assessed by docking. Among the 17 SNPs, four missense variants E389A, K392Q, T393S and Q438E lead to \"directly increasing\" the interaction affinity and 2 missense variants R470I and Y416C cause it \"directly decreasing\". The R470I and Y416C present in African and American population, respectively. While the other 4 SNP variants (E389A; K392Q; T393S and Q438E) are present only in the European population, which could link the viral infection susceptibility to demographic, geographic and genetic factors.",

    "abstract": "Bordetella bronchiseptica injects virulence proteins called effectors into host cells via a type III secretion system (T3SS) conserved among many Gram-negative bacteria. Small proteins called chaperones are required for stabilizing some T3SS components or localizing them to the T3SS machinery. In a previous study, we identified a chaperone-like protein named Bcr4 that regulates T3SS activity in B. bronchiseptica. Bcr4 does not show strong sequence similarity to well-studied T3SS proteins of other bacteria, and its function remains to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the mechanism by which Bcr4 controls T3SS activity. A pull-down assay revealed that Bcr4 interacts with BscI, based on its homology to other bacterial proteins, to be an inner rod protein of the T3SS machinery. An additional pull-down assay using truncated Bcr4 derivatives and secretion profiles of B. bronchiseptica producing truncated Bcr4 derivatives showed that the Bcr4 C-terminal region is necessary for the interaction with BscI and activation of the T3SS. Moreover, the deletion of BscI abolished the secretion of type III secreted proteins from B. bronchiseptica and the translocation of a cytotoxic effector into cultured mammalian cells. Finally, we showed that BscI is unstable in the absence of Bcr4. These results suggest that Bcr4 supports the construction of the T3SS machinery by stabilizing BscI. This is the first demonstration of a chaperone for the T3SS inner rod protein among the virulence bacteria possessing the T3SS.\n\nImportanceThe type III secretion system (T3SS) is a needle-like complex that projects outward from bacterial cells. Bordetella bronchiseptica uses the T3SS to inject virulence proteins into host cells. Our previous study reported that a protein named Bcr4 is essential for the secretion of virulence proteins from B. bronchiseptica bacterial cells and delivery through the T3SS. Because other bacteria lack a Bcr4 homologue, the function of Bcr4 has not been elucidated. In this study, we discovered that Bcr4 interacts with BscI, a component of the T3SS machinery. We showed that a B. bronchiseptica BscI-deficient strain was unable to secrete type III secreted proteins. Furthermore, in a B. bronchiseptica strain that overproduces T3SS component proteins, Bcr4 is required to maintain BscI in bacterial cells. These results suggest that Bcr4 stabilizes BscI to allow construction of the T3SS in B. bronchiseptica.",

    "abstract": "MAb based immunotherapies targeting systemic and deep-seated fungal infections are still in their early stages of development with currently no licensed antifungal mAbs available for patients at risk. The cell wall glycoproteins of Candida albicans are of particular interest as potential targets for therapeutic antibody generation due to their extracellular location and key involvement in fungal pathogenesis. Here we describe the generation of recombinant human antibodies specifically targeting two key cell wall proteins (CWPs) in C. albicans - Utr2 and Pga31. These antibodies were isolated from a phage display antibody library using peptide antigens representing the surface exposed regions of CWPs expressed at elevated levels during in vivo infection. Reformatted human-mouse chimeric mAbs preferentially recognised C. albicans hyphal forms compared to yeast cells and an increased binding was observed when the cells were grown in the presence of the antifungal agent caspofungin. In J774.1 macrophage interaction assays, mAb pre-treatment resulted in a faster engulfment of C. albicans cells suggesting a role of the CWP antibodies as opsonising agents during phagocyte recruitment. Finally, in a series of clinically predictive, mouse models of systemic candidiasis, our lead mAb achieved an improved survival (83%) and several log reduction of fungal burden in the kidneys, similar to levels achieved for the fungicidal drug caspofungin, and superior to any anti-Candida mAb therapeutic efficacy reported to date.",

    "abstract": "Mayaro virus (MAYV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus that causes an acute febrile illness accompanied by arthralgia, similar to chikungunya virus. Increasing urbanization of MAYV outbreaks in the Americas has led to concerns that this virus could further expand its geographic range. Given the potential importance of this pathogen, we sought to fill some critical gaps in knowledge regarding MAYV infectivity and geographic variation. This study describes the cytopathogenicity of MAYV in human dermal fibroblasts, human skeletal muscle satellite cells, human embryonic kidney cells (HEK), peripherally derived human macrophages, and Vero cells. MAYV strain isolated from Bolivia (MAYV-U) infected cells more rapidly compared to MAYV strains isolated in Peru and Brazil (MAYV-P; MAYV-B), with high titers (1x108 pfu/ml) peaking at 37 hours post infection. MAYV-U also caused the most cytopathic effect in a time dependent manner. Furthermore, differently from the other two prototypic strains, MAYV-U harbors unique mutations in the E2 protein, D60G and S205F, likely to interact with the host cell receptor, which may explain the observed differences in infectivity. We further demonstrate that pre-treatment of cells with interferon-{beta} inhibited viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. Together, these findings advance our understanding of MAYV infection of human target cells and provide initial data regarding MAYV phenotypic variation according to geography.\n\nAuthor SummaryArthropod-borne viruses are of great public health concern, causing epidemics worldwide due to climate change, changes in land use, rapid urbanization, and the expanding geographic ranges of suitable vectors. Among these viruses, Mayaro is an emerging virus for which little is currently known. This study aims to answer fundamental questions of Mayaro virus biology using three geographically distinct viral strains to examine variability in infection kinetics and infectivity in susceptible cell types. We found one geographic isolate to have accelerated infection kinetics and increased cell damage because of infection. To better understand what was unique about this isolate, we compared their envelope protein, which is critical for entry into a cell. We found that the isolate with increased replication kinetics possessed mutations at sites that may promote viral entry, which could explain these findings. Together, these findings further our understanding of Mayaro virus biology and provide insight into factors that contribute to Mayaro transmission and infectivity.",

    "abstract": "Plasmodium falciparum exports ~10% of its proteome into its host erythrocyte to modify the host cells physiology. The Plasmodium export element (PEXEL) motif contained within the N-terminus of most exported proteins directs the trafficking of those proteins into the erythrocyte. To reach the host cell, the PEXEL motif of exported proteins are processed by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) resident aspartyl protease plasmepsin V. Then, following secretion into the parasite-encasing parasitophorous vacuole, the mature exported protein must be unfolded and translocated across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane by the Plasmodium translocon of exported proteins (PTEX). PTEX is a protein-conducting channel consisting of the pore-forming protein EXP2, the protein unfoldase HSP101, and structural component PTEX150. The mechanism of how exported proteins are specifically trafficked from the parasites ER following PEXEL cleavage to PTEX complexes on the parasitophorous vacuole membrane is currently not understood. Here, we present evidence that EXP2 and PTEX150 form a stable subcomplex that facilitates HSP101 docking. We also demonstrate that HSP101 localises both within the parasitophorous vacuole and within the parasites ER throughout the ring and trophozoite stage of the parasite, coinciding with the timeframe of protein export. Interestingly, we found that HSP101 can form specific interactions with model PEXEL proteins in the parasite ER, irrespective of their PEXEL processing status. Collectively, our data suggest that HSP101 recognises and chaperones PEXEL proteins from the ER to the parasitophorous vacuole and given HSP101s specificity for the EXP2-PTEX150 subcomplex, this provides a mechanism for how exported proteins are specifically targeted to PTEX for translocation into the erythrocyte.\n\nAuthor SummaryPlasmodium falciparum, the most lethal species of human malaria parasite, infects erythrocytes and develops within a parasitophorous vacuole. To support rapid parasite growth and immune evasion, the parasite remodels its erythrocyte by exporting a myriad of proteins into the erythrocyte compartment. Parasite proteins destined for export are first imported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and then secreted into the parasitophorous vacuole, where they are translocated across the parasitophorous vacuole membrane into the erythrocyte via a protein-conducting channel called PTEX. A missing link in the story has been how proteins destined for export are specifically guided from the ER to PTEX at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. In this study, we found that one of the core PTEX components, HSP101, resides within the parasites ER, in addition to its PTEX-related location at the parasitophorous vacuole. We also found that ER-located HSP101 can interact transiently with cargo proteins en route to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. Our findings support a model in which HSP101 forms an initial interaction with exported proteins in the ER and then chaperones them to the rest of PTEX at the parasitophorous vacuole membrane for export into the erythrocyte.",

    "abstract": "Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an Alphavirus transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, causing fever, rash and arthralgia. The function of the CHIKV non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) remains enigmatic. Building on previous studies (Gao et al, 2019), we generated a panel of mutants in a conserved and surface-exposed cluster in the nsP3 alphavirus unique domain (AUD) and tested their replication phenotype using a sub-genomic replicon (SGR) in mammalian and mosquito cells. Three mutants that replicated poorly in mammalian cells showed no defect in mosquito cells. These mutants were temperature-sensitive, rather than species-specific, as they exhibited no replication defect in mammalian cells at sub-physiological temperature (28{degrees}C). Similar effects were observed in the context of infectious CHIKV and the closely related ONyong Nyong virus. This analysis also revealed that the wildtype SGR replicated more efficiently at 28{degrees}C compared to 37{degrees}C. This was not due to either impaired interferon responses as the enhancement was observed in Vero cells, or to a defect in eIF2 phosphorylation as treatment with ISRIB, an inhibitor of global translation attenuation, did not compensate for replication defects at 37{degrees}C. The phenotype did correlate with enhanced recruitment of stress granule proteins (G3BP, eIF4G and TIA-1) into cytoplasmic sites of genome replication at 28{degrees}C. As cells in the periphery will be at sub-physiological temperatures, and will be the first cells infected in the mammalian host following a mosquito bite, we propose that alphaviruses such as CHIKV have evolved mechanisms to both promote viral genome replication and concomitantly limit antiviral responses in these cells.\n\nImportanceChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging arbovirus, transmitted by Aedes mosquitos and posing epidemic threats. Arboviruses must be able to replicate efficiently in both the mosquito vector and the mammalian host, at different temperatures. Following a mosquito bite the first cells infected will be in the skin and at sub-physiological temperature (less than 37{degrees}C). We show that mutants in one of the CHIKV proteins (nsP3) could not replicate at 37{degrees}C, but replicated efficiently in mammalian cells at 28{degrees}C. We also showed that wildtype CHIKV replicated more efficiently at 28{degrees}C in comparison to 37{degrees}C in mammalian cells. We investigated the mechanism behind this observation and showed that at sub-physiological temperatures proteins present in cytoplasmic stress granules were more efficiently recruited to sites of virus replication. We propose that CHIKV has evolved mechanisms to promote their replication in mammalian cells at sub-physiological temperatures to facilitate infection of mammals via a mosquito bite.",

    "abstract": "Fungi play an important role in carbon - and nutrient cycling. It is, however, unclear if diversity of fungi is essential to fulfill this role. With this meta-analysis, we aim to understand the relationship between fungal diversity and decomposition of plant materials (leaf litter and wood) in terrestrial and aquatic environments. The selection criteria for papers were the presence of a fungal diversity gradient and quantification of decomposition as mass loss. In total 40 papers met the selection criteria. We hypothesized that increase of fungal species will result in stronger decomposition, especially in species poor communities. Both artificial inoculated and naturally assembled fungal communities were included in the analysis in order to assess whether manipulated experiments are representative for field situations. We found a significant positive effect of increased fungal diversity on decomposition. However, in manipulated experiments this relationship was only positive when a control treatment of one fungus was compared with multispecies communities. This relationship became negative when comparisons of higher initial richness (at least two fungal species as \"control\") were included. In contrast, under natural field conditions increased fungal diversity coincided with increased decomposition. This suggests that manipulated experiments are not representative for field situations. Possible reasons for this are discussed. Yet, both in manipulated and field experiments, environmental factors can influence diversity - decomposition relationships as indicated by a negative relationship of increasing C:N ratio on the effect of fungal diversity on decomposition. Overall, our results show that fungal diversity can have an important role in decomposition, but that design of experiments (manipulated or field) and quality of the plant material should be taken into account for interpretation of this diversity-functioning relationship.",

    "abstract": "The plant hormone cytokinin (CK) is an important developmental regulator, promoting morphogenesis and delaying senescence. Previous work by us and others has demonstrated that CKs also mediate plant immunity and disease resistance. Some phytopathogens have been reported to secrete CKs, and may manipulate CK signaling to regulate the host cell cycle and nutrient allocation, to improve their pathogenic abilities. In a recent work, we demonstrated that CK directly inhibits the growth, development, and virulence of fungal phytopathogens, by down regulating the cell cycle and reducing cytoskeleton organization and cellular trafficking in the fungus. Here, focusing on Botrytis cinerea (Bc), we report that the effect of CK on Bc is tied to nutrient availability; CK strongly inhibits Bc growth and de-regulated cytoskeleton organization in a nutrient rich environment, but has a diminished effect when nutrients are scarce. Using biochemical assays and transgenic redox sensitive botrytis lines, we examined the effect of CK on energy consumption in the fungus, and demonstrate that CK promotes glycolysis and energy consumption in Bc, both in vitro and in planta. Here, glycolysis and increased oxidation were stronger with waning nutrient availability. Transcriptomic data further supports our findings, demonstrating significant upregulation to glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation, and sucrose metabolism, upon CK treatment. The metabolic effects of CK on the fungus likely reflect the role of plant CK during early infection by necrotrophic pathogens, which are known to have an initial, short biotrophic phase. In addition to the plant producing CK during its interaction with the pathogen for defense priming and pathogen inhibition, the pathogen may take advantage of this increased CK to boost its metabolism and energy production, in preparation for the necrotrophic phase of the infection. Thus, the role of CK in controlling senescence can be exploited by diverse phytopathogens to their advantage.\n\nAuthor summaryCytokinin (CK) is one of the primary plant developmental hormones, regulating many developmental processes. Several works have highlighted the involvement of CK in plant defense. We recently reported that CK can directly inhibit fungal plant pathogens. CK inhibits Botrytis cinerea growth by arresting the cell cycle and de-regulating cytoskeleton organization and cellular trafficking. Here, we report that CK positively regulates B. cinerea energy consumption, causing an increase in glycolytic rates and energy consumption. The effect of CK on B. cinerea was dependent on nutrient availability, with CK causing stronger increases in glycolysis and lower growth inhibition when nutrient availably was low, and weaker glycolytic increases coupled with stronger growth inhibition in a high nutrient environment. We propose that CK can be viewed as a bidirectional signaling molecule in plant pathogen interactions: CK acts as a signal to the fungus that plant tissue is present, causing it to activate sugar and energy metabolism pathways to take advantage of the available food source, while at the same time, CK is employed by the plant to inhibit the attacking pathogen.",

    "abstract": "Many bacterial pathogens antagonize host defence responses by translocating effector proteins into cells. It remains an open question how those pathogens not encoding effectors counteract anti-bacterial immunity. Here, we show that Klebsiella pneumoniae hijacks the evolutionary conserved innate immune protein SARM1 to control cell intrinsic immunity. Klebsiella exploits SARM1 to regulate negatively MyD88 and TRIF-governed inflammation, and the activation of the MAP kinases ERK and JNK. SARM1 is required for Klebsiella induction of IL10 by fine-tuning the p38-type I IFN axis. SARM1 inhibits the activation of Klebsiella-induced absent in melanoma 2 inflammasome to limit IL1{beta} production, suppressing further inflammation. Klebsiella exploits type I IFNs to induce SARM1 in a capsule and LPS O-polysaccharide-dependent manner via TLR4-TRAM-TRIF-IRF3-IFNAR1 pathway. Absence of SARM1 reduces the intracellular survival of K. pneumonaie in macrophages whereas sarm1 deficient mice control the infection.

    "abstract": "The incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is disproportionately high in the eastern corridor of Africa and parts of Asia. Emerging research has identified a potential association between poor oral health and ESCC. One proposed biological pathway linking poor oral health and ESCC involves the alteration of the microbiome. Thus, we performed an integrated analysis of four independent sequencing efforts of ESCC tumors from patients from high- and low-incidence regions of the world. Using whole genome sequencing (WGS) and RNA sequencing (RNAseq) of ESCC tumors and WGS of synchronous collections of saliva specimens from 61 patients in Tanzania, we identified a community of bacteria, including members of the genera Fusobacterium, Selenomonas, Prevotella, Streptococcus, Porphyromonas, Veillonella, and Campylobacter, present at high abundance in ESCC tumors. We then characterized the microbiome of 238 ESCC tumor specimens collected in two additional independent sequencing efforts consisting of patients from other high-ESCC incidence regions (Tanzania, Malawi, Kenya, Iran, China). This analysis revealed a similar tumor enrichment of the ESCC-associated bacterial community in these cancers. Because these genera are traditionally considered members of the oral microbiota, we explored if there is a relationship between the synchronous saliva and tumor microbiomes of ESCC patients in Tanzania. Comparative analyses revealed that paired saliva and tumor microbiomes are significantly similar with a specific enrichment of Fusobacterium and Prevotella in the tumor microbiome. Together, these data indicate that cancer-associated oral bacteria are associated with ESCC tumors at the time of diagnosis and support a model in which oral bacteria are present in high abundance in both saliva and tumors of ESCC patients. Longitudinal studies of the pre-diagnostic oral microbiome are needed to investigate whether these cross-sectional similarities reflect temporal associations.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities occupy diverse niches in nature, and exchanges of metabolites such as carbon sources, amino acids, and vitamins occur routinely among the community members. While large-scale metagenomic and metabolomic studies shed some light on these exchanges, the contribution of individual species and the molecular details of specific interactions are difficult to track. Here, we explore the molecular picture of vitamin B1 (thiamin) metabolism occurring in synthetic communities of Escherichia coli thiamin auxotrophs which engage in the exchange of thiamin and its biosynthesis intermediates. In E. coli, the two parts of thiamin - the 4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine and the 4-methyl-5-(2-hydroxyethyl)thiazole - are synthesized by separate pathways using enzymes ThiC and ThiG, respectively, and are then joined by ThiE to form thiamin. We observed that even though E. coli {Delta}thiC, {Delta}thiE, and{Delta} thiG mutants are thiamin auxotrophs, co-cultures of{Delta} thiC-{Delta}thiE and{Delta} thiC-{Delta}thiG grow in a thiamin-deficient minimal medium, whereas the{Delta} thiE-{Delta}thiG co-culture does not. Analysis of the exchange of thiamin and its intermediates in Vibrio anguillarum co-cultures, and in mixed co-cultures of V. anguillarum and E. coli revealed that the general pattern of thiamin metabolism and exchange among microbes is conserved across species. Specifically, the microorganisms exchange HMP and thiamin easily among themselves but not THZ. Furthermore, we observe that the availability of exogenous thiamin in the media affects whether these strains interact with each other or grow independently. This underscores the importance of the exchange of essential metabolites as a defining factor in building and modulating synthetic or natural microbial communities.",

    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a major nosocomial pathogen that can cause severe, toxin-mediated diarrhea and pseudomembranous colitis. Recent work has shown that C. difficile exhibits heterogeneity in swimming motility and toxin production in vitro through phase variation by site-specific DNA recombination. The recombinase RecV reversibly inverts the flagellar switch sequence upstream of the flgB operon, leading to the ON/OFF expression of flagellum and toxin genes. How this phenomenon impacts C. difficile virulence in vivo remains unknown. We identified mutations in the right inverted repeat that reduced or prevented flagellar switch inversion by RecV. We introduced these mutations into C. difficile R20291 to create strains with the flagellar switch \"locked\" in either the ON or OFF orientation. These mutants exhibited a loss of flagellum and toxin phase variation during growth in vitro, yielding precisely modified mutants suitable for assessing virulence in vivo. In a hamster model of acute C. difficile infection, the phase-locked ON mutant caused greater toxin accumulation than the phase locked OFF mutant but did not differ significantly in the ability to cause acute disease symptoms. In contrast, in a mouse model, preventing flagellum and toxin phase variation affected the ability of C. difficile to colonize the intestinal tract and to elicit weight loss, which is attributable to differences in toxin production during infection. These results show that the ability of C. difficile to phase vary flagella and toxins influences colonization and disease development and suggest that the phenotypic variants generated by flagellar switch inversion have distinct capacities for causing disease.",

    "abstract": "Antibodies are key to the clearance of Bartonella bacteremia, but the mechanisms and targets of protective antibodies are unknown and bacterial evasion strategies remain elusive. We studied experimental Bartonella taylorii infection of mice, its natural host, and investigated protective immune responses. Clearance of bacteremia depended on specific antibodies that interfere with bacterial attachment to erythrocytes. Accordingly, antibodies were effective in the absence of complement and Fc-receptors. Moreover, they formed independently of B-cell hypermutation and isotype class switch. The cloning of neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) led to the identification of the bacterial autotransporter CFA as a protective antibody target, and vaccination against CFA protected against Bartonella bacteremia. MAb binding mapped to a region of CFA that is hypervariable in both human- and mouse-pathogenic Bartonella strains, suggesting mutational antibody evasion. These insights further our understanding of Bartonella immunity and immune evasion and elucidate mechanisms driving high Bartonella prevalence in the wild.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial cell division is a complex and highly regulated process requiring the coordination of many different proteins. Despite substantial work in model organisms, our understanding of the systems regulating cell division in non-canonical organisms, including critical human pathogens, is far from complete. One such organism is Staphylococcus aureus, a spherical bacterium that lacks known cell division regulatory proteins. Recent studies on GpsB, a protein conserved within the Firmicutes phylum, have provided insight into cell division regulation in S. aureus and other related organisms. It has been revealed that GpsB coordinates cell division and cell wall synthesis in multiple species by interacting with Penicillin Binding Proteins (PBPs) and other partners. In S. aureus, we have previously shown that GpsB directly regulates FtsZ polymerization. In this study, using Bacillus subtilis as a tool, we isolated intragenic and extragenic spontaneous suppressor mutants that abrogate the lethality of S. aureus GpsB overproduction in B. subtilis. Through characterization of these mutants, we identified several key residues important for the function of GpsB. Furthermore, we discovered an additional role for GpsB in wall teichoic acid (WTA) biosynthesis in S. aureus. Specifically, we show that GpsB directly interacts with the wall teichoic acid export protein TarG using a bacterial two-hybrid analysis. We also identified a three-residue motif in GpsB that is crucial for this interaction. Based on the analysis of the localization of TagG in B. subtilis and its homolog TarG in S. aureus, it appears that WTA machinery is a part of the divisome complex. As such, we show additional evidence to the growing body of work that suggests that along with peptidoglycan synthesis, WTA biosynthesis and export may take place at the site of cell division. Taken together, this research illustrates how GpsB performs an essential function in S. aureus by directly linking the tightly regulated cell cycle processes of cell division and WTA-mediated cell surface decoration.\n\nIMPORTANCE/AUTHOR SUMMARYCytokinesis in bacteria involves an intricate orchestration of several key cell division proteins and other factors involved in building a robust cell envelope. One of the key factors that differentiates Gram-positive bacteria from Gram-negative bacteria is the presence of teichoic acids interlaced within the Gram-positive cell wall. By characterizing the role of Staphylococcus aureus GpsB, an essential cell division protein in this organism, we have uncovered an additional role for GpsB in wall teichoic acids (WTA) biosynthesis. We show that GpsB directly interacts with TarG of the WTA export complex. We also show this function of GpsB may be conserved in other GpsB homologs as GpsB and the WTA exporter complex follow similar localization patterns. It has been suggested that WTA acts as a molecular signal to control the activity of autolytic enzymes, especially during the separation of conjoined daughter cells. Thus, our results reveal that GpsB, in addition to playing a role in cell division, may also help coordinate WTA biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "DNA topoisomerase II (Top2) is a nuclear protein that resolves DNA topological problems and plays critical roles in multiple nuclear processes. Human cells have two Top2 proteins, Top2A and Top2B, that are localized in both the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. Previously, ATP depletion was shown to augment the nucleolar localization of Top2B, but the molecular details of subnuclear distributions, particularly of Top2A, remained to be fully elucidated in relation to the status of cellular ATP. Here, we analyzed the nuclear dynamics of human Top2A and Top2B in ATP-depleted cells. Both proteins rapidly translocated from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus in response to ATP depletion. FRAP analysis demonstrated that they were highly mobile in the nucleoplasm and nucleolus. The nucleolar retention of both proteins was sensitive to the RNA polymerase I inhibitor BMH-21, and the Top2 proteins in the nucleolus were immediately dispersed into the nucleoplasm by BMH-21. Under ATP-depleted conditions, the Top2 poison etoposide was less effective, indicating the therapeutic relevance of Top2 subnuclear distributions. These results give novel insights into the subnuclear dynamics of Top2 in relation to cellular ATP levels and also provide discussions about its possible mechanisms and biological significance.",

    "abstract": "Kinesins are motor proteins found in all eukaryotic lineages that move along microtubules to mediate cellular processes such as mitosis and intracellular transport. In trypanosomatids, the kinesin superfamily has undergone a prominent expansion, resulting in one of the most diverse kinesin repertoires that includes the two kinetoplastid-restricted families X1 and X2. Here, we characterize in Trypanosoma brucei TbKifX2A, an orphaned X2 kinesin. TbKifX2A tightly interacts with TbPH1, a kinesin-like protein with a likely inactive motor domain, a rarely reported occurrence. Both TbKifX2A and TbPH1 localize to the microtubule quartet (MtQ), a characteristic but poorly understood cytoskeletal structure that wraps around the flagellar pocket as it extends to the cell body anterior. The proximal proteome of TbPH1 revealed two other interacting proteins, the flagellar pocket protein FP45 and intriguingly another X2 kinesin, TbKifX2C. Simultaneous ablation of TbKifX2A/TbPH1 results in the depletion of FP45 and TbKifX2C and also an expansion of the flagellar pocket, among other morphological defects. TbKifX2A is the first motor protein to be localized to the MtQ. The observation that TbKifX2C also associates with the MtQ suggests that the X2 kinesin family may have co-evolved with the MtQ, both kinetoplastid-specific traits.",

    "abstract": "Iron is an essential element for nearly all organisms, and under anoxic and/or reducing conditions, Fe2+ is the dominant form of iron available to bacteria. The ferrous iron transport (Feo) system has been identified as the primary prokaryotic Fe2+ import machinery, and two proteins (FeoA and FeoB) are conserved across most bacterial species. However, how FeoA and FeoB function relative to one another remained enigmatic. In this work we explored the distribution of feoAB operons predicted to encode for a fusion of FeoA tethered to the soluble N-terminal, G-protein domain of FeoB via a connecting linker region. We hypothesized that this fusion might poise FeoA to interact with FeoB in order to affect function. To test this hypothesis, we cloned, expressed, purified, and biochemically characterized the soluble NFeoAB fusion protein from Bacteroides fragilis, a commensal organism implicated in drug-resistant peritoneal infections. Using X-ray crystallography, we determined to 1.50 [A] resolution the structure of BfFeoA, which adopts an SH3-like fold implicated in protein-protein interactions. In combination with structural modeling, small-angle X-ray scattering, and hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we show that FeoA and NFeoB indeed interact in a nucleotide-dependent manner, and we have mapped the protein-protein interaction interface. Finally, using GTP hydrolysis assays, we demonstrate that BfNFeoAB exhibits one of the slowest known rates of Feo-mediated GTP hydrolysis and is not potassium-stimulated, indicating that FeoA-NFeoB interactions may function to stabilize the GTP-bound form of FeoB. Our work thus reveals a role for FeoA function in the fused FeoAB systems and suggests a broader role for FeoA function amongst prokaryotes.",

Our approach was consistently repeated for the conjugation of antibodies against CD44 and EGFR, which are prominent cancer cell markers. The functionalized particles presented excellent cell specificity towards CD44 and EGFR overexpressing cells, respectively. Our results indicated that the developed coating method is reproducible, versatile, non-toxic, and can be used for particle functionalization with different antibodies.

The enzyme kinetic parameters and enzyme-substrate interaction studies demonstrated that LdGSTu1 could catalyze the conjugation of GSH to both CDNB and PNA, with a higher turnover number for CDNB than PNA.

    "abstract": "Bacterial volatile compounds have emerged as important chemical messengers between bacteria themselves as well as in their interactions with other organisms. One of the earliest examples of bioactive volatiles emitted by bacteria is hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which was long considered a mere respiratory toxin conferring competitive advantage to cyanogenic strains. Using cyanide-deficient mutants in two Pseudomonas strains and global transcriptome analysis, we demonstrate that the impact of HCN is much more global than previously thought. We first observed that the lack of cyanogenesis in emitting strains led to massive transcriptome reprogramming affecting diverse traits such as motility and biofilm formation (respectively inhibited vs. promoted by HCN), or the production of siderophores, phenazines and other antimicrobial compounds (repressed by HCN). We then exposed non-cyanogenic strains to biogenically emitted HCN from neighboring cells and observed similar transcriptome modulations and phenotypic changes, suggesting that HCN not only acts endogenously but also exogenously, remotely manipulating important traits involved in competition and virulence, e.g. siderophore production, in other organisms. Cyanogenesis in Pseudomonas has long been known to play a role in both the virulence of opportunistic pathogens and the efficient biocontrol activity of plant-beneficial strains, however this impact was so far thought to occur solely through the inhibition of respiration. We demonstrate here new ecological roles for a small and fast-diffusing volatile compound, which opens novel avenues in our understanding of and ability to interfere with important processes taking place in pathogenic and beneficial Pseudomonas strains.\n\nImportanceBacteria communicate by exchanging chemical signals, some of which are volatile and can remotely reach other organisms. Hydrogen cyanide (HCN) was one of the first volatiles discovered to severely impact exposed organisms by inhibiting their respiration. Using HCN-deficient mutants in two Pseudomonas strains, we demonstrate that HCNs impact goes beyond the sole inhibition of respiration and affects both emitting and receiving bacteria in a global way, modulating their motility, biofilm formation and production of antimicrobial compounds. Our data suggest that bacteria could use HCN not only to control their own cellular functions, but also to remotely influence the behavior of other bacteria sharing the same environment. Since HCN emission occurs in both clinically and environmentally relevant Pseudomonas, these findings are important to better understand or even modulate the expression of bacterial traits involved in both virulence of opportunistic pathogens and in biocontrol efficacy of plant-beneficial strains.",

    "abstract": "The Nrf2/Keap1 axis plays a complex role in viral susceptibility, virus-associated inflammation and immune regulation. However, whether or how the Nrf2/Keap1 axis is involved in the interactions between equine lentiviruses and their hosts remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the Nrf2/Keap1 axis was activated during EIAV infection. Mechanistically, EIAV-Rev competitively binds to Keap1 and releases Nrf2 from Keap1-mediated repression, leading to the accumulation of Nrf2 in the nucleus and promoting Nrf2 responsive genes transcription. Subsequently, we demonstrated that the Nrf2/Keap1 axis represses EIAV replication via two independent molecular mechanisms: directly increasing antioxidant enzymes to promote effective cellular resistance against EIAV infection, and repression of Rev-mediated RNA transport through direct interaction between Keap1 and Rev. Together, these data suggest that activation of the Nrf2/Keap1 axis mediates a passive defensive response to combat EIAV infection. The Nrf2/Keap1 axis could be a potential target for developing the strategies for combating EIAV infection.\n\nAuthor summaryHere we report that the Nrf2/Keap1 axis acts as an antiviral effector on EIAV replication through two-way regulation of Rev. On the one hand, EIAV-Rev activates the Nrf2/Keap1 axis by competitive interaction with Keap1, which promotes the transcription of cytoprotective genes implicated in the antiviral response. On the other hand, Keap1 restricts Rev/RRE-dependent RNA transport, leading to inhibition of viral protein synthesis and reduction in viral replication. This study highlights the importance of the Nrf2/Keap1 axis in controlling EIAV replication, and identifies this pathway as a potential new entry-point for treating lentivirus infection. Importantly, this report provides new insights into the regulation of viral replication by the Nrf2/Keap1 axis.",

    "abstract": "HIV-establishes a persistent proviral reservoir by integrating into the genome of infected host cells. Current antiretroviral treatments do not target this persistent population of proviruses which include latently infected cells that upon treatment interruption can be reactivated to contribute to HIV-1 rebound. Deep sequencing of persistent HIV proviruses has revealed that greater than 90% of integrated HIV genomes are defective and unable to produce infectious virions. We hypothesized that intragenic elements in the HIV genome support transcription of aberrant HIV-1 RNAs from defective proviruses that lack long terminal repeats (LTRs). Using an intact provirus detection assay, we observed that resting CD4+ T cells and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) are biased towards generating defective HIV-1 proviruses. Multiplex reverse transcription digital drop PCR identified Env and Nef transcripts which lacked 5 untranslated regions (UTR) in acutely infected CD4+ T cells and MDMs indicating transcripts are generated that do not utilize the promoter within the LTR. 5UTR-deficient Env transcripts were also identified in a cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH) on ART, suggesting that these aberrant RNAs are produced in vivo. Using 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE), we mapped the start site of these transcripts within the Env gene. This region bound several cellular transcription factors and functioned as a transcriptional regulatory element that could support transcription and translation of downstream HIV-1 RNAs. These studies provide mechanistic insights into how defective HIV-1 proviruses are persistently expressed to potentially drive inflammation in PLWH.\n\nAuthor SummaryPeople living with HIV establish a persistent reservoir which includes latently infected cells that fuel viral rebound upon treatment interruption. However, the majority of HIV-1 genomes in these persistently infected cells are defective. Whether these defective HIV genomes are expressed and whether they contribute to HIV associated diseases including accelerated aging, neurodegenerative symptoms, and cardiovascular diseases are still outstanding questions. In this paper, we demonstrate that acute infection of macrophages and resting T cells is biased towards generating defective viruses which are expressed by DNA regulatory elements in the HIV genome. These studies describe an alternative mechanism for chronic expression of HIV genomes.",

    "abstract": "The entry routes and translocation mechanisms of bacterial pathogens into the central nervous system remain obscure. We report here that Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) or polystyrene microspheres, applied to the nose of a mouse, appeared in the meninges of the dorsal cortex within minutes. Recovery of viable bacteria from dissected tissue and fluorescence microscopy showed that up to at least 72h, Sp and microspheres were predominantly in the outer of the two meninges, the pachymeninx. No Sp were found in blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Evidence that this was not an artifact of the method of administration is that in mice infected by horizontal transmission, Sp were also predominantly in the meninges and absent from blood. Intravital imaging through the skull, and flow cytometry showed recruitment and activation of LysM+ cells in the dorsal pachymeninx at 5h and 10h following intranasal infection. Imaging of the cribriform plate suggested that both Sp and microspheres entered through its foramina via an inward flow of fluid connecting the nose to the pachymeninx. Our findings bring further insight into the invasion mechanisms of bacterial pathogens such as Sp into the central nervous system, but are also pertinent to the delivery of drugs to the brain, and the entry of air-borne particles into the cranium.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by aberrant Complex I assembly and reduced activity of the electron transport chain is pathogenic in many genetic and age-related diseases. Mice missing the Complex I subunit NADH dehydrogenase [ubiquinone] iron-sulfur protein 4 (NDUFS4) are a leading mammalian model of severe mitochondrial disease that exhibit many characteristic symptoms of Leigh Syndrome including oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, brain lesions, and premature death. NDUFS4 knockout mice have decreased expression of nearly every Complex I subunit. As Complex I normally contains at least 8 iron-sulfur clusters and more than 25 iron atoms, we asked whether a deficiency of Complex I may lead to intracellular iron perturbations thereby accelerating disease progression. Consistent with this, iron supplementation accelerates symptoms of brain degeneration in these mice while iron restriction delays the onset of these symptoms and increases survival. NDUFS4 knockout mice display signs of iron overload in the liver including increased expression of hepcidin, and show changes in iron responsive element-regulated proteins consistent with increased intracellular iron that were prevented by iron restriction. These results suggest that perturbed iron homeostasis may contribute to pathology in Leigh Syndrome and possibly other mitochondrial disorders.",

    "abstract": "Nitroaromatic functional groups can impart valuable properties to chemicals and to biological macromolecules including polypeptides. Para-nitro-L-phenylalanine (pN-Phe) is a nitroaromatic amino acid with uses including immune stimulation and fluorescence quenching. As the chemical synthesis of pN-Phe does not follow green chemistry principles and impedes provision of pN-Phe to engineered bacterial cells in some contexts, we sought to design a de novo biosynthetic pathway for pN-Phe in Escherichia coli. To generate the nitro chemical functional group, we identified natural diiron monooxygenases with measurable in vitro and in vivo activity on envisioned amine-containing precursors of para-amino-L-phenylalanine (pA-Phe) and para-aminophenylpyruvate. By expressing one of these N-oxygenase genes together with previously characterized genes for the biosynthesis of pA-Phe, we achieved the synthesis of pN-Phe from glucose. Through further optimization of the chassis, plasmid constructs, and media conditions, we were able to improve the selectivity of pN-Phe biosynthesis, resulting in a maximum titer of 819 {micro}M in rich defined media under shake-flask conditions. These results provide a foundation for the biosynthesis of related nitroaromatic chemicals and for downstream biological applications that could utilize pN-Phe as a building block.\n\nHighlightsO_LIPara-nitro-L-phenylalanine (pN-Phe) is a valuable small molecule for its applications in genetic code expansion.\nC_LIO_LIWe establish de novo biosynthesis of pN-Phe from glucose in E. coli, which is also the first example of a de novo pathway design for an unnatural but commonly used non-standard amino acid.\nC_LIO_LIWe show the first use of an N-oxygenase enzyme in the de novo synthesis of a nitroaromatic product.\nC_LIO_LIScreening of natural N-oxygenases and strain engineering resulted in final pN-Phe titers of 820 {+/-} 130 {micro}M in shake flask experiments with rich defined media.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Gene regulation based on regulatory RNA is an important mechanism in cells and is increasingly used for regulatory circuits in synthetic biology. Toehold switches are rationally designed post-transcriptional riboregulators placed in the 5 untranslated region of mRNA molecules. In the inactive state of a toehold switch, the ribosome-binding site is inaccessible for the ribosome. In the presence of a trigger RNA molecule protein production is turned on. Using antisense RNA against trigger molecules (anti-trigger RNA), gene expression can also be switched off again. We here study the utility and regulatory effect of antisense transcription in this context, which enables a particularly compact circuit design. Our circuits utilize two inducible promoters that separately regulate trigger and anti-trigger transcription, whereas their cognate toehold switch, regulating expression of a reporter protein, is transcribed from a constitutive promoter. We explore various design options for the arrangement of the promoters and demonstrate that the resulting dynamic behavior is strongly influenced by transcriptional interference (TI) effects, leading to more than four-fold differences in expression levels. Our experimental results are consistent with previous findings that enhanced local RNA polymerase concentrations due to active promoters in close proximity lead to an increase in transcriptional activity of the strongest promoter in the circuits. Based on this insight, we selected optimum promoter designs and arrangements for the realization of a genetic circuit comprised of two toehold switches, two triggers and two anti-triggers that function as a post-transcriptional RNA regulatory exclusive OR (XOR) gate.",

    "abstract": "Peptidoglycan is a major constituent of the bacterial cell wall and an important determinant for providing protection to cells. Besides peptidoglycan (PG), many bacteria synthesize other glycans that become part of the cell wall. Streptomycetes grow apically, where they synthesize a glycan that is exposed at the outer surface, but how it gets there is unknown. Here we show that deposition of the apical glycan at the cell surface depends on two key enzymes, the endoglucanase CslZ and the lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase LpmP. Activity of these enzymes allows localized remodeling and degradation of the PG, and we propose that this facilitates passage of the glycan. The absence of both enzymes not only prevents morphological development, but also sensitizes strains to lysozyme. Given that lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases are commonly found in microbes, this newly identified biological role in cell-wall remodelling may be widespread.",

This study aims to evaluate the land use land cover change and drivers of change that occurred between 1988 and 2018. Landsat 5(TM), Landsat7 (ETM+), and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRs) imagery sensors, field observation, and socio-economic survey data were used. The temporal and spatial Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was calculated and tested the correlation between NDVI and precipitation/temperature. The study computed a kappa coefficient of the dry season (0.90) and wet season (0.845). Continuous decline of woodland (29.38%) and riparian vegetation (47.11%) whereas an increasing trend of shrub-bushland (35.28%), grassland (43.47%), bareland (27.52%), and cultivated land (118.36 km2) were showed over thirty years. More results showed bare land was expanded from wet to drier months, while, cultivated land and grazing land increased from dry to wet months. Based on the NDVI result high-moderate vegetation was decreased by 21.47% while sparse & non-vegetation was expanded by 19.8% & 1.7% (36.5 km2) respectively. Settlement & agricultural expansion, human-induced fire, firewood collection, gold mining, and charcoal production were the major proximate drivers that negatively affected the park resources. Around KSNP, the local community livelihood depends on farming, expansion of agricultural land is the main driver for woodland dynamics/depletion and this leads to increase resources competition and challenges for the survival of wildlife. Therefore, urgent sustainable conservation of park biodiversity via encouraging community participation in conservation practices and preparing awareness creation programs should be mandatory.",
