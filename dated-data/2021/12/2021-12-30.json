    "abstract": "Extreme-value analysis (EVA) deals with deviations in the data from the median of the probability distributions. EVA serves various purposes such as predicting disasters and analyzing sports records. Herein, we extended the use of EVA to investigate the motility functions of nanoscale motor proteins in neurons of the living worm Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Motor proteins, such as kinesin and dynein, move along microtubules anterogradely and retrogradely, respectively, to deliver the cargo-containing materials needed for the cells. Although the essential difference between the two motors could not be inferred from the mean velocity values, the return-level EVA plots obtained from the velocity data revealed a difference. Shape parameters of the generalized extreme value distribution of EVA{xi} < 0 for anterograde transport and{xi} [&ge;] 0 for retrograde transport. Our findings extend the possibility and applicability of EVA for analyzing motility data of nanoscale proteins in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Two-component signaling systems (TCSs) in bacteria are often positively auto-regulated, where the histidine kinase (HK) and response regulator (RR) proteins comprising a TCS are expressed downstream of the signal they transduce. This auto-regulation improves the sensitivity of the TCS to stimuli and amplifies adaptive responses. The downside, however, is that the TCS may mount disproportionately large responses to weak or fleeting signals. How bacteria prevent such disproportionate responses is not known. Here, we show that sequestration of phosphorylated HKs by non-cognate RRs serves as a design to prevent such disproportionate responses. Using TCSs of M. tuberculosis as model systems, we found that with every one of the five HKs we studied, there was at least one non-cognate RR with higher affinity than that of the cognate RR for the HK. Phosphorylated HKs would thus preferentially bind the non-cognate RRs, suppressing signal transduction through the cognate pathways, which we demonstrated in vitro. Using mathematical modeling of TCS signaling in vivo, we predicted that this sequestration would introduce a threshold level of stimulation for a significant response, preventing responses to signals below this threshold. Finally, we showed in vivo using tunable expression systems in M. bovis that upregulation of a higher affinity non-cognate RR substantially suppressed the output from the cognate TCS pathway, presenting strong evidence of sequestration by non-cognate RRs as a design to regulate TCS signaling. Blocking this sequestration may be a novel intervention strategy, as it would compromise bacterial fitness by letting it respond unnecessarily to signals.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWhile the olfactory system is required for proper social behaviors, the molecular basis for how social cues are detected via the main olfactory pathway of mammals is not well-characterized. Trimethylamine is a volatile, sex-specific odor found in adult male mouse urine that selectively activates main olfactory sensory neurons that express trace amine-associated receptor 5 (TAAR5). Here we show that trimethylamine, acting via TAAR5, elicits state-dependent attraction or aversion in male mice and drives inter-male aggression. Genetic knockout of TAAR5 significantly reduces aggression-related behaviors, while adding trimethylamine augments aggressive behavior towards juvenile males. We further show that transgenic expression of TAAR5 specifically in olfactory sensory neurons rescues aggressive behaviors in knockout mice, despite extensive remapping of TAAR5 projections to the olfactory bulb. Our results identify a specific main olfactory input that detects a prominent male-specific odor to induce inter-male aggression in a mammalian species and reveal that apparently innate behavioral responses are independent of patterned glomerular input to the olfactory bulb.",

    "abstract": "The spine apparatus is a specialization of the neuronal ER in dendritic spines consisting of stacks of interconnected cisterns separated by a dense matrix. Synaptopodin, a specific actin binding protein of the spine apparatus, is essential for its formation, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We show that synaptopodin, when expressed in fibroblasts, forms actin-rich structures with connections to the ER, and that an ER-tethered synaptopodin assembles into liquid condensates. We also identified protein neighbors of synaptopodin in spines by in vivo proximity biotinylation. We validated a small subset of such proteins and showed that they co-assemble with synaptopodin in living cells. One of them is Pdlim7, an actin binding protein not previously identified in spines, and we show its precise colocalization with synaptopodin. We suggest that the matrix of the spine apparatus has the property of a liquid protein condensate generated by a multiplicity of low affinity interactions.\n\nGraphical abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=131 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474557v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@197d23borg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b60eeorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a8ce67org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@186cd0a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Long-term information associated with neuronal memory resides in dendritic spines. However, spines can have a limited size due to metabolic and neuroanatomical constraints, which should effectively limit the amount of encoded information in excitatory synapses. This study investigates how much information can be stored in the sizes of dendritic spines, and whether is it optimal in any sense? It is shown here, using empirical data for several mammalian brains across different regions and physiological conditions, that dendritic spines nearly maximize entropy contained in their volumes and surface areas for a given mean size in cortical and hippocampal regions. This result is essentially independent of the type of a fitting distribution to size data, as both short- and heavy-tailed distributions yield similar 90 - 100% information efficiency in the majority of cases. On average, the highest information is contained in spine length (4 - 5 bits), and the lowest in spine volume and area (2 - 3 bits), although the latter two are closer to optimality. In contrast, we find that entropy density (entropy per spine size) is always suboptimal. Our results suggest a universality of entropy maximization in spine volumes and areas, which can be a new principle of memory storing in cortical and hippocampal synapses.\n\nSignificance statementIt is believed that memory in the brain is stored in the parts of excitatory synapses called dendritic spines. But how efficient is the memory capacity given synaptic size variability? Generally, the larger the synapse the more information can be packed in its structure. However, this process comes at some cost, as larger synapses use more metabolic energy and brain tissue. Thus, there exists a benefit-cost trade-off for storing long-term information in dendritic spines, with a unique optimal solution set by an average spine size. We show that volumes and areas of actual spines in different parts of the brain across different mammals and conditions are in majority of cases very close to that optimal theoretical solution for storing information, which is a remarkable result.",

    "abstract": "Microbial eukaryotes display a stunning diversity of feeding strategies, ranging from generalist predators to highly specialised parasites. The unicellular \"protoplast feeders\" represent a fascinating mechanistic intermediate, as they penetrate other eukaryotic cells (algae, fungi) like some parasites, but then devour their cell contents by phagocytosis. Besides prey recognition and attachment, this complex behaviour involves the local, pre-phagocytotic dissolution of the prey cell wall, which results in well-defined perforations of species-specific size and structure. Yet, the molecular processes that enable protoplast feeders to overcome cell walls of diverse biochemical composition remain unknown. We used the flagellate Orciraptor agilis (Viridiraptoridae, Rhizaria) as a model protoplast feeder, and applied differential gene expression analysis to examine its penetration of green algal cell walls. Besides distinct expression changes that reflect major cellular processes (e.g. locomotion, cell division), we found lytic carbohydrate-active enzymes that are highly expressed and upregulated during the attack on the alga. A putative endocellulase (family GH5_5) with a secretion signal is most prominent, and a potential key factor for cell wall dissolution. Other candidate enzymes (e.g. lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases) belong to families that are largely uncharacterised, emphasising the potential of non-fungal micro-eukaryotes for enzyme exploration. Unexpectedly, we discovered various chitin-related factors that point to an unknown chitin metabolism in Orciraptor, potentially also involved in the feeding process. Our findings provide first molecular insights into an important microbial feeding behaviour, and new directions for cell biology research on non-model eukaryotes.",

    "abstract": "In the zebrafish lateral line system, interneuromast cells (INCs) between neuromasts are normally kept quiescent by underlying Schwann cells (SWCs). Upon severe injuries that cause the complete loss of an entire neuromast, INCs can occasionally differentiate into neuromasts but how they escape from the inhibition by SWCs is still unclear. Using a genetic/chemical method to specifically ablate a neuromast, we found a small portion of larvae can regenerate a new neuromast, but the regeneration was hindered by inhibiting macrophages. By in toto imaging, we further discovered heterogeneities in macrophage behavior and distribution along lateral line. We witnessed the crawling of macrophages in between injured lateral line and SWCs during regeneration and also in between the second primordium and the first mature lateral line during development. It implies that macrophages may physically separate and alleviate the inhibition from pLLn and SWCs to break the quiescence of INCs during regeneration and development in the zebrafish lateral line.",

Traditionally, scale-down systems at the laboratory scale are used to analyze the effects of fluctuating pH values on strain and thus process performance. Here, we demonstrate the application of dynamic microfluidic single-cell cultivation (dMSCC) as a novel scale-down system for the characterization of Corynebacterium glutamicum growth using oscillating pH conditions as a model parameter. A detailed comparison between two-compartment reactor (two-CR) scale-down experiments and dMSCC was performed for one specific pH oscillation between reference pH 7 ([~] 8 min) and disturbed pH 6 ([~]2 min). Similar reductions in growth rates were observed in both systems (dMSCC 21% and two-CR 27%). Afterward, systematic experiments at different symmetric and asymmetric pH oscillations between pH ranges of 4-6 and 8-11 and different intervals from 1 minute to 20 minutes, were performed to demonstrate the unique application range and throughput of the dMSCC system. Finally, the strength of the dMSCC application was demonstrated by mimicking fluctuating environmental conditions within large-scale bioprocesses, which is difficult to conduct using two-CRs.",

    "abstract": "DNA has emerged as a powerful substrate for programming information processing machines at the nanoscale. Among the DNA computing primitives used today, DNA strand displacement (DSD) is arguably the most popular, with DSD-based circuit applications ranging from disease diagnostics to molecular artificial neural networks. The outputs of DSD circuits are generally read using fluorescence spectroscopy. However, due to the spectral overlap of typical small-molecule fluorescent reporters, the number of unique outputs that can be detected in parallel is limited, requiring complex optical setups or spatial isolation of reactions to make output bandwidths scalable. Here, we present a multiplexable sequencing-free readout method that enables real-time, kinetic measurement of DSD circuit activity through highly parallel, direct detection of barcoded output strands using nanopore sensor array technology (Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION device). We show that engineered reporter probes can be detected and classified with high accuracy at the single-molecule level directly from raw nanopore signals using deep learning. We then demonstrate this methods utility in multiplexed detection of clinically relevant microRNA sequences. These results increase DSD output bandwidth by an order of magnitude over what is possible with fluorescence spectroscopy, laying the foundations for a new paradigm in DNA circuit readout and programmable multiplexed molecular diagnostics using portable nanopore devices.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial capacity is critical to adapt the high energy demand of the heart to circadian oscillations and diseased states. Glucocorticoids regulate the circadian cycle of energy metabolism, but little is known about how circadian timing of exogenous glucocorticoid dosing directly regulates heart metabolism through cardiomyocyte-autonomous mechanisms. While chronic oncedaily intake of glucocorticoids promotes metabolic stress and heart failure, we recently discovered that intermittent once-weekly dosing of exogenous glucocorticoids promoted muscle metabolism in normal and obese skeletal muscle. However, the effects of glucocorticoid intermittence on heart metabolism and heart failure remain unknown. Here we investigated the extent to which circadian time of dosing regulates the effects of the glucocorticoid prednisone in heart metabolism and function in conditions of single pulse or chronic intermittent dosing. In WT mice, we found that prednisone improved cardiac content of NAD+ and ATP with light-phase dosing (ZT0), while the effects were blocked by dark-phase dosing (ZT12). The drug effects on mitochondrial function were cardiomyocyte-autonomous, as shown by inducible cardiomyocyte-restricted glucocorticoid receptor (GR) ablation, and depended on an intact cardiomyocyte clock, as shown by inducible cardiomyocyte-restricted ablation of Brain and Muscle ARNT-like 1 (BMAL1). Conjugating time-of-dosing with chronic intermittence, we found that once-weekly prednisone improved metabolism and function in heart after myocardial injury dependent on circadian time of intake, i.e. with lightphase but not dark-phase dosing. Our study identifies cardiac-autonomous mechanisms through which circadian-specific intermittent dosing reconverts glucocorticoid drugs to metabolic boosters for the heart.",

    "abstract": "Right-sided myocardial mechanical efficiency (work output/metabolic energy input) in pulmonary hypertension can be severely reduced. We determined the contribution of intrinsic myocardial determinants of efficiency using papillary muscle preparations from monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertensive (MCT-PH) rats. The hypothesis was tested that efficiency is reduced by mitochondrial dysfunction in addition to increased activation heat reported previously. Right ventricular (RV) muscle preparations were subjected to 5 Hz sinusoidal length changes at 37{degrees}C. Work and suprabasal oxygen consumption (VO2) were measured before and after cross-bridge inhibition by blebbistatin. Cytosolic cytochrome c concentration, myocyte cross-sectional area, proton permeability of the inner mitochondrial membrane (PP IMM), and monoamine oxidase (MAO)-A and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) activities and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and cardiolipin (CL) contents were determined. Mechanical efficiency ranged from 23 to 11% in control (n = 6) and from 22 to 1% in MCT-PH (n = 15) and correlated with work (r2 = 0.68, P < 0.0001) but not with VO2 (r2 = 0.004, P = 0.7919). VO2 for cross-bridge cycling was proportional to work (r2 = 0.56, P = 0.0005). Blebbistatin-resistant VO2 (r2 = 0.32, P = 0.0167) and IMM PP (r2 = 0.36, P = 0.0110) correlated inversely with efficiency. Together, these variables explained the variance of efficiency (coefficient of multiple determination R2 = 0.79, P = 0.0001). Cytosolic cytochrome c correlated inversely with work (r2 = 0.28, P = 0.0391), but not with efficiency (r2 = 0.20, P = 0.0867). G-6-PDH, MAO-A and PG/CL increased in the RV wall of MCT-PH but did not correlate with efficiency. Reduced myocardial efficiency in MCT-PH is due to activation processes and mitochondrial dysfunction. The variance of work and the ratio of activation heat reported previously and blebbistatin-resistant VO2 are discussed.\n\nKey pointsO_LIMechanical efficiency of right ventricular myocardium is reduced in pulmonary hypertension. Increased energy use for activation processes has been demonstrated previously, but the contribution of mitochondrial dysfunction is unknown.\nC_LIO_LIWork and oxygen consumption is determined during work loops. Oxygen consumption for activation and cross-bridge cycling confirm the previous heat measurements.\nC_LIO_LICytosolic cytochrome c concentration, proton permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane and phosphatidylglycerol/cardiolipin are increased in experimental pulmonary hypertension.\nC_LIO_LIMitochondrial dysfunction in right ventricular myocytes is related to reduced work and mechanical efficiency in experimental pulmonary hypertension.\nC_LIO_LIUpregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and a potential gap in the energy balance suggest mitochondrial dysfunction in right ventricular overload is due to excessive production of reactive oxygen species.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Individuals who have Down syndrome (trisomy 21) are at greatly increased risk of developing Alzheimers disease - dementia. Alzheimers disease is characterised by the accumulation in the brain of amyloid-{beta} plaques that are a product of amyloid precursor protein, encoded by the APP gene on chromosome 21. In Down syndrome the first site of amyloid-{beta} accumulation is within endosomes and changes to endosome biology occur early in disease. Here we determine if primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from two mouse models of Down syndrome can be used to study endosome and APP cell biology. We report that in these cellular models of Down syndrome endosome number, size and APP processing are not altered, likely because APP is not dosage sensitive in these models, despite three copies of App.",
