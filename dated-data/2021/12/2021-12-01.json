    "abstract": "Proteins exist in several different conformations. These structural changes are often associated with fluctuations at the residue level. Recent findings show that co-evolutionary analysis coupled with machine- learning techniques improves the precision by providing quantitative distance predictions between pairs of residues. The predicted statistical distance distribution from Multi Sequence Analysis (MSA) reveals the presence of different local maxima suggesting the flexibility of key residue pairs. Here we investigate the ability of the residue-residue distance prediction to provide insights into the protein conformational ensemble. We combine deep learning approaches with mechanistic modeling to a set of proteins that experimentally showed conformational changes. The predicted protein models were filtered based on energy scores, RMSD clustering, and the centroids selected as the lowest energy structure per cluster. The models were compared to the experimental-Molecular Dynamics (MD) relaxed structure by analyzing the backbone residue torsional distribution and the sidechain orientations. Our pipeline not only allows us to retrieve the global experimental folding but also the experimental structural dynamics. We show the potential correlation between the experimental structure dynamics and the predicted model ensemble demonstrating the susceptibility of the current state-of-the-art methods in protein folding and dynamics prediction and pointing out the areas of improvement.",

    "abstract": "Organelle heterogeneity and inter-organelle associations within a single cell contribute to the limited sensitivity of current organelle separation techniques, thus hindering organelle subpopulation characterization. Here we use direct current insulator-based dielectrophoresis (DC-iDEP) as an unbiased separation method and demonstrate its capability by identifying distinct distribution patterns of insulin vesicles from pancreatic {beta}-cells. A multiple voltage DC-iDEP strategy with increased range and sensitivity has been applied, and a differentiation factor (ratio of electrokinetic to dielectrophoretic mobility) has been used to characterize features of insulin vesicle distribution patterns. We observed a significant difference in the distribution pattern of insulin vesicles isolated from glucose-stimulated cells relative to unstimulated cells, in accordance with functional maturation of vesicles upon glucose stimulation, and interpret this to be indicative of high-resolution separation of vesicle subpopulation. DC-iDEP provides a path for future characterization of subtle biochemical differences of organelle subpopulations within any biological system.",

    "abstract": "DNA integrity is an important factor to assure genome stability and, more generally, cells and organisms viability. In presence of DNA damage, the normal cell cycle is perturbed while cells activate their repair processes. Although efficient, the repair system is not always able to ensure the complete restoration of gene integrity. In these cases, not only mutations may occur, but the accumulation of lesions can either lead to carcinogenesis or reach a threshold which induces apoptosis and the programmed cell death. Among the different types of DNA lesions, strand breaks produced by ionizing radiations are the most toxic, due to their inherently difficult repair, which may lead to genomic instability. In this article we show, by using classical molecular simulations techniques, that differently from the canonical double-helical B-DNA, guanine-quadruplex (G4) arrangements show a remarkable structural stability, even in presence of two strand breaks. Since G4-DNA are recognized for their regulatory roles in cell senescence and gene expression, also involving oncogene, their stability can be related to an evolutionary cellular response aimed at minimizing the effects of ionizing radiation.",

    "abstract": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play essential roles as a second messenger in various physiological processes in plants. Due to their oxidative nature, ROS can also be harmful. Thus, the generation and homeostasis of ROS are tightly controlled by multiple enzymes. Membrane-localized NADPH oxidases are well known to generate ROS during developmental and stress responses, but the metabolic pathways of the superoxide (O2{middle dot}-) generated by them in the apoplast are poorly understood, and the identity of the apoplastic superoxide dismutase (SOD) is unknown in Arabidopsis. Here, we show that a putative manganese SOD, MSD2 is secreted and possesses a SOD activity that can be inhibited by nitration at tyrosine 68. The expression of MSD2 in roots is light condition-dependent, suggesting that MSD2 may act on ROS metabolism in roots during the light-to-dark transition. Root architecture is governed by ROS distribution that exhibits opposite gradient of H2O2 and O2{middle dot}-, which is indeed altered in etiolated msd2 mutants and accompanied by changes in the onset of differentiation. These results provide a missing link in our understanding of ROS metabolism and suggest that MSD2 plays a role in root skotomorphogenesis by regulating ROS distribution, thereby playing a pivotal role in plant growth and development.",

    "abstract": "T cells that recognize tumor antigens are crucial for anti-tumor immune responses. Induction of anti-tumor T cells in immunogenic tumors depends on STING, the intracellular innate immune receptor for cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) and related cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs). However, the optimal way to leverage STING activation in non-immunogenic tumors is still unclear. Here, we show that cGAMP delivery by intra-tumoral injection of virus-like particles (cGAMP-VLP) leads to differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, decrease in tumor regulatory T cells (Tregs) and anti-tumoral responses that synergize with PD1 blockade. By contrast, intra-tumoral injection of synthetic CDN leads to tumor necrosis and systemic T cell activation but no differentiation of tumor-specific T cells, and a demise of immune cells in injected tumors. Analyses of cytokine responses and genetic models revealed that cGAMP-VLP preferentially targets STING in dendritic cells at a 1000-fold less dose than synthetic CDN. Sub-cutaneous administration of cGAMP-VLP showed synergy when combined with a tumor Treg-depleting antibody to elicit systemic tumor-specific T cells, leading to complete and lasting tumor eradication. These finding show that cell targeting of STING stimulation shapes the anti-tumor T cell response and reveal a therapeutic strategy with T cell modulators.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial pathogens require a variety of micronutrients for growth, including trace metals such as iron, manganese, and zinc (Zn). Despite their relative abundance in host environments, access to these metals is severely restricted during infection due to host-mediated defense mechanisms collectively known as nutritional immunity. Despite a growing appreciation of the importance of Zn in host-pathogen interactions, the mechanisms of Zn homeostasis and the significance of Zn to the pathophysiology of E. faecalis, a major pathogen of nosocomial and community-associated infections, have not been investigated. Here, we show that E. faecalis encoded an ABC-type transporter AdcACB and an orphan substrate-binding lipoprotein AdcAII that work cooperatively to maintain Zn homeostasis. Simultaneous inactivation of adcA and adcAII or the entire adcACB operon led to significant reduction in intracellular Zn under Zn-restricted conditions, heightened sensitivity to Zn-chelating agents including human calprotectin, aberrant cell morphology, and impaired fitness in serum ex vivo. Additionally, inactivation of adcACB and adcAII significantly reduced bacterial tolerance towards cell envelope-targeting antibiotics, which may be associated to altered fatty acid abundance and species. Lastly, we show that the AdcACB/AdcAII system contributes to E. faecalis virulence in an invertebrate (Galleria mellonella) infection model and in two catheter-associated mouse infection models that recapitulate many of the host conditions associated with enterococcal human infections. Collectively, this report reveals that high-affinity Zn import is essential for the pathogenesis of E. faecalis indicating that the surface-associated AdcA and AdcAII lipoproteins are potential therapeutic targets.",

Sponge-dwelling gobies benefit from protection within sponge tubes and greater food availability. Sponge-dwelling gobies are hypothesized to increase sponge pump rates by consuming polychaete parasites, but such increases have not yet been demonstrated. We investigated the association between sponge-dwelling gobies (Elacatinus horsti) and two species of tube sponge (Aplysina lacunosa and Aplysina archeri) in Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. We visually assessed goby presence in sponges and used in situ methods with fluorescein dye to estimate feeding rates via pump rates. Aplysina archeri were more likely to host a goby than A. lacunosa. For both sponge species, pump rates of tubes with gobies were higher on average than those of tubes without gobies. Our observations, therefore, suggest that E. horsti associations with Aplysina are likely mutualistic relationships in which sponges benefit from higher feeding rates when gobies are present.",

However, despite being widely used, the currently available C. briggsae reference genome is substantially less complete and structurally accurate than the C. elegans reference genome. Here, we used high-coverage Oxford Nanopore long-read and chromosome conformation capture data to generate chromosomally resolved reference genomes for two C. briggsae strains: QX1410, a new reference strain closely related to the laboratory AF16 strain, and VX34, a highly divergent strain isolated in China. We also sequenced 99 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated from reciprocal crosses between QX1410 and VX34 to create a recombination map and identify chromosomal domains. Additionally, we used both short- and long-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to generate high-quality gene annotations. By comparing these new reference genomes to the current reference, we reveal that hyper-divergent haplotypes cover large portions of the C. briggsae genome, similar to recent reports in C. elegans and C. tropicalis. We also show that the genomes of selfing Caenorhabditis species have undergone more rearrangement than their outcrossing relatives, which has biased previous estimates of rearrangement rate in Caenorhabditis. These new genomes provide a substantially improved platform for comparative genomics in Caenorhabditis and narrow the gap between the quality of genomic resources available for C. elegans and C. briggsae.",

In silico tools are emerging as a powerful means to overcome these challenges and have the potential to actualize novel breakthroughs. Here, we present an interdisciplinary framework combining in vitro experiments used to develop an elegant and scalable in silico model of oxygen diffusion. We then use in utero imaging of placental perfusion and oxygenation in both control and growth-restricted rodent placentas for validation of our in silico model. Our framework revealed the structure-function relationship in the feto-placental vasculature; oxygen diffusion is impaired in growth-restricted placentas, due to the diminished arborization of growth-restricted feto-placental vasculature and the lack of decelerated flow for adequate oxygen diffusion and exchange. We highlight the mechanisms of impairment in a rat model of growth restriction, underpinned by placental vascular impairment. Our framework reports and validates the prediction of blood flow deceleration impairment in growth restricted placentas with the placentas oxygen transfer capability being significantly impaired, both globally and locally.",

To identify druggable targets for DMG, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen that reveals a DMG selective dependency on the de novo pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis. This metabolic vulnerability reflects an elevated rate of uridine/uracil degradation that depletes DMG cells of substrates for the alternate salvage pathway for pyrimidine biosynthesis. A clinical stage inhibitor of DHODH (rate limiting enzyme in the de novo pathway) diminishes UMP pools, generates DNA damage, and induces apoptosis through suppression of replication forks--an \"on target\" effect, as shown by uridine rescue. MALDI mass spectroscopy imaging demonstrates that this DHODH inhibitor (BAY2402234) accumulates in brain at therapeutically relevant concentrations, suppresses de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis in vivo, and prolongs survival of mice bearing intracranial DMG xenografts, highlighting BAY2402234 as a promising therapy against DMGs.",

In this study, administration of ZA reduced myofibroblast transition and blocked NF-kB signaling in macrophages leading to impaired immune cell recruitment. ZA treatment of mice with bleomycin-induced lung damage displayed decreased levels of cytokines in the BALF, plasma, and lung tissue, resulting in less histologically visible fibrotic scarring. Additionally, bleomycin induced production of the ZA target, farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), was reduced in lung tissue and fibroblasts upon ZA treatment.

    "abstract": "In plants, secretion of cell wall components and membrane proteins plays a fundamental role in growth and development as well as survival in diverse environments. Exocytosis, as the last step of the secretory trafficking pathway, is a highly ordered and precisely controlled process involving tethering, docking, and fusion of vesicles at the plasma membrane (PM) for cargo delivery. Although the exocytic process and machinery are well characterized in yeast and animal models, the molecular players and specific molecular events that underpin late stages of exocytosis in plant cells remain largely unknown. Here, by using the delivery of functional, fluorescent-tagged cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes (CSCs) to the PM as a model system for secretion, as well as single-particle tracking in living cells, we describe a quantitative approach for measuring the frequency of vesicle tethering events. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of cytoskeletal function, reveal that the initial vesicle tethering step of exocytosis is dependent on actin and myosin XI. In contrast, treatments with the microtubule inhibitor, oryzalin, did not significantly affect vesicle tethering or fusion during CSC exocytosis but caused a minor increase of transient or aborted tethering events. With data from this new quantitative approach and improved spatiotemporal resolution of single particle events during secretion, we generate a revised model for the role of the cortical cytoskeleton in CSC trafficking.",

However, these studies suffer from chemical fixation artifacts and limited volumes of tomographic reconstruction. We have examined Arabidopsis thaliana cotyledon samples preserved by high-pressure freezing with scanning transmission electron tomography to visualize larger volumes in etioplasts and their conversion into chloroplasts. PLB tubules were arranged in a zinc blende-type lattice like carbon atoms in diamonds. Within 2 hours after illumination, the lattice collapsed from the PLB exterior and the disorganized tubules merged to form fenestrated sheets that eventually matured into lamellar thylakoids. These planar thylakoids emerging from PLBs overlapped or folded into grana stacks in PLBs vicinity. Since the nascent lamellae had curved membrane at their tips, we examined the localization of CURT1 proteins. CURT1A transcript was most abundant in de-etiolating cotyledon samples, and CURT1A concentrated at the peripheral PLB. In curt1a mutant etioplasts, thylakoid sheets were swollen and failed to develop stacks. In curt1c mutant, however, PLBs had cracks in their lattices, indicating that CURT1C contributes to cubic crystal growth under darkness.

In the current study, we elucidate a role for NON-RACE-SPECIFIC DISEASE RESISTANCE1 (NDR1) by exploiting effector-triggered immunity (ETI) to define the regulation of plant host immunity in response to both pathogen infection and elevated temperature. We generated time-series RNA sequencing data of WT Col-0, a NDR1 overexpression line, as well as ndr1 and ics1-2 mutant plants under elevated temperature. Not surprisingly, the NDR1-overexpression line showed genotype-specific gene expression changes related to defense response and immune system function. Interestingly, overexpression of NDR1 revealed a role for NDR1 in immune system function; specifically, we describe a mechanism that intersects with Pseudomonas syringae, type-III effector translocation, R-protein signaling complex stabilization, and sustained levels of SA at elevated temperature during ETI. The results described herein support a role for NDR1 in maintaining cell signaling during simultaneous exposure to elevated temperature and avirulent pathogen stressors.\n\nOne-sentence summaryNDR1 is required for Pst-AvrRpt2 triggered ETI at elevated temperature.",

    "abstract": "Experience with enriched environments positively impacts the health and wellbeing of nonhuman animals ranging from rodents to primates. Little is known, however, about the specific effects of enhanced cognitive enrichment (ECE) on nonhuman primates. The study reported here used archival samples to provide preliminary analysis of ECE on hormones associated with stress and wellbeing, as well as evaluation of persistent effects of infant social rearing. Hair samples from 24 adult male rhesus macaques were analyzed via LC-MS/MS technique for the main stress response hormones: cortisol, cortisone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. The ECE and care-as-usual (CAU) groups did not significantly differ in any of the mean analyte values. Cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone were strongly and positively correlated in the ECE group. By contrast, for the CAU group the two analytes were weakly correlated. Within the ECE group, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone were significantly and positively correlated in the mother-reared group, but not in the nursery-reared group. Overall, these results provide preliminary evidence that experience with ECE could help to maintain a balanced cortisol:dehydroepiandrosterone ratio, possibly indicative of a healthy stress response. Further examination of this ratio in hair is needed to support this hypothesis. These observations may also suggest that nursery rearing could have persistent effects, including dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, apparent in the unbalanced cortisol:dehydroepiandrosterone ratio. Together these findings are consistent with the growing literature that supports the use of ECE to promote nonhuman primate wellbeing and healthy development.",

    "abstract": "Temporal identity factors regulate the competence of neural progenitors to generate specific cell types in a time-dependent manner, but how they operate remains poorly defined. In the developing mouse retina, the Ikaros zinc finger transcription factor Ikzf1 regulates the production of early-born cell types, except cone photoreceptors. In this study we show that Ikzf4, another Ikaros family protein, cooperates with Ikzf1 to control cone photoreceptor production during early stages of retinal development, whereas at late stages, when Ikzf1 is no longer expressed in progenitors, Ikzf4 is instead required for Muller glia production. Using CUT&RUN sequencing, we find that both Ikzf1 and Ikzf4 generally bind to the same genes involved in cone development and other early-born fates, but at different cis-regulatory elements. In late-stage progenitors, Ikzf4 re-localizes to bind target genes involved in Muller glia development and regulate their expression. Specifically, we show that Ikzf4 maintains Hes1 expression in differentiating cells using two Ikzf GGAA binding sites at the Hes1 promoter, thereby favouring Muller glia fate commitment. These results uncover a combinatorial role for Ikaros family members in nervous system development and provide mechanistic insights on how they temporally regulate cell fate output.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian cell lines are important expression systems for large proteins and protein complexes, particularly when the acquisition of post-translational modifications in the proteins native environment is desired. However, low or variable transfection efficiencies are challenges that must be overcome to use such an expression system. Expression of recombinant proteins as a fluorescent protein fusion enables real-time monitoring of protein expression, and also provides an affinity handle for one-step protein purification using a suitable affinity reagent. Here we describe a panel of anti-GFP and anti-mCherry nanobody affinity matrices and their efficacy for purification of GFP/YFP or mCherry fusion proteins. We define the molecular basis by which they bind their target protein using X-ray crystallography. From these analyses we define an optimal pair of nanobodies for purification of recombinant protein tagged with GFP/YFP or mCherry, and demonstrate these nanobody-sepharose supports are stable to many rounds of cleaning and extended incubation in denaturing conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the mCherry-tag system by using it to purify recombinant human Topoisomerase 2 expressed in HEK293F cells. The mCherry-tag and GFP/YFP-tag expression systems can be utilized for recombinant protein expression individually or in tandem for mammalian protein expression systems where real-time monitoring of protein expression levels and a high-efficiency purification step is needed.",

    "abstract": "A trend in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) aquaculture is to establish new production sites that are suitable for extreme weather conditions. However, continuous and strong currents can harm fish welfare. To determine the location of the net cage, it is necessary to assess the swimming ability of large yellow croaker. Currently, our research on large yellow croakers is focusing on behavior analysis. This article investigates the effect of swimming large yellow croakers on metabolites in the body by examining the preferred speed of the group and the endurance swimming ability of single-tailed fish. We evaluated the factors that influence the large yellow croakers swimming fatigue by quantifying the content of metabolites and constructed the endurance swimming model using those results. Various results showed large yellow croaker populations tend to grow in low-velocity environments, and this matches their traditional habitat. The samples were taken at different swimming times at a flow rate of 0.35 m/s. According to the results of the metabolite content determination, blood glucose levels is closely related to swimming ability in large yellow croakers. The content of liver glycogen, which regulates blood glucose concentration, decreases in a certain linear relationship. The endurance swimming model of large yellow croaker was constructed according to the changes of liver glycogen content. The goals of this article are to provide a deeper understanding of the physiological characteristics of large yellow croaker swimming, and to provide a reference for choosing fishing and cage sites for large yellow croaker.",

Low plasma levels of thyroid hormones lead to hypothyroidism, which is one of the most common disorder in humans and is not always satisfactorily treated by lifelong hormone replacement. Therefore, in addition to the lack of in vitro tractable models to study human thyroid development, differentiation and maturation, functional human thyroid organoids could pave the way to explore new therapeutic approaches. Here we report the first transplantable thyroid organoids derived from human embryonic stem cells capable of restoring plasma thyroid hormone to athyreotic mice as a proof of concept for future therapeutic development.",

    "abstract": "The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is a conserved embryonic process in animals where developmental control shifts from the maternal to zygotic genome. A key step in this transition is zygotic transcription, and deciphering the MZT requires classifying newly transcribed genes. However, due to current technological limitations, this starting point remains a challenge for studying many species. Here we present an alternative approach that characterizes transcriptome changes based solely on RNA-seq data. By combining intron-mapping reads and transcript-level quantification, we characterized transcriptome dynamics during the Drosophila melanogaster MZT. Our approach provides an accessible platform to investigate transcriptome dynamics that can be applied to the MZT in non-model organisms. In addition to classifying zygotically transcribed genes, our analysis revealed that over 300 genes express different maternal and zygotic transcript isoforms due to alternative splicing, polyadenylation, and promoter usage. The vast majority of these zygotic isoforms have the potential to be subject to different regulatory control, and over two-thirds encode different proteins. Thus, our analysis reveals an additional layer of regulation during the MZT, where new zygotic transcripts can generate additional proteome diversity.",

    "abstract": "We recently reported that serine-arginine-rich (SR) protein-mediated pre-mRNA structural remodeling generates a pre-mRNA 3D structural scaffold that is stably recognized by the early spliceosomal components. However, the intermediate steps between the free pre-mRNA and the assembled early spliceosome are not yet characterized. By probing the early spliceosomal complexes in vitro and RNA-protein interactions in vivo, we show that the SR proteins bind the pre-mRNAs cooperatively generating a substrate that recruits U1 snRNP and U2AF65 in a splice signal-independent manner. Excess U1 snRNP selectively displaces some of the SR protein molecules from the pre-mRNA generating the substrate for splice signal-specific, sequential recognition by U1 snRNP, U2AF65, and U2AF35. Our work thus identifies a novel function of U1 snRNP in mammalian splicing substrate definition, explains the need for excess U1 snRNP compared to other U snRNPs in vivo, demonstrates how excess SR proteins could inhibit splicing, and provides a conceptual basis to examine if this mechanism of splicing substrate definition is employed by other splicing regulatory proteins.",
