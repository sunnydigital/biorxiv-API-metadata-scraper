    "abstract": "COVID-19 pathogen SARS-CoV-2 has infected hundreds of millions and caused over 5 million deaths to date. Although multiple vaccines are available, breakthrough infections occur especially by emerging variants. Effective therapeutic options such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are still critical. Here, we report the development, cryo-EM structures, and functional analyses of mAbs that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. By high-throughput single cell sequencing of B cells from spike receptor binding domain (RBD) immunized animals, we identified two highly potent SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing mAb clones that have single-digit nanomolar affinity and low-picomolar avidity, and generated a bispecific antibody. Lead antibodies showed strong inhibitory activity against historical SARS-CoV-2 and several emerging variants of concern. We solved several cryo-EM structures at [~]3 [A] resolution of these neutralizing antibodies in complex with prefusion spike trimer ectodomain, and revealed distinct epitopes, binding patterns, and conformations. The lead clones also showed potent efficacy in vivo against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in both prophylactic and therapeutic settings. We also generated and characterized a humanized antibody to facilitate translation and drug development. The humanized clone also has strong potency against both the original virus and the B.1.617.2 Delta variant. These mAbs expand the repertoire of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2 and emerging variants.",

    "abstract": "Nucleosome assembly requires the coordinated deposition of histone complexes H3-H4 and H2A-H2B to form a histone octamer on DNA. In the current paradigm, specific histone chaperones guide the deposition of first H3-H4 and then H2A-H2B(1-5). Here, we show that the acidic domain of DNA repair factor APLF (APLFAD) can assemble the histone octamer in a single step, and deposit it on DNA to form nucleosomes. The crystal structure of the APLFAD-histone octamer complex shows that APLFAD tethers the histones in their nucleosomal conformation. Mutations of key aromatic anchor residues in APLFAD affect chaperone activity in vitro and in cells. Together, we propose that chaperoning of the histone octamer is a mechanism for histone chaperone function at sites where chromatin is temporarily disrupted.\n\none sentence summaryHistone chaperone APLF assembles histones H2A-H2B/H3-H4 into histone octamers to deposit them onto DNA and form nucleosomes.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotic cells, RNA polymerase II synthesizes mRNA in three stages, initiation, elongation, and termination, and numerous factors determine how quickly a gene is transcribed to produce mRNA molecules through these steps. However, there are few techniques available to measure the rate of each step in living cells, which prevents a better understanding of transcriptional regulation. Here, we present a quantitative analysis method to extract kinetic rates of transcription from time-lapse imaging data of fluorescently labeled mRNA in live cells. Using embryonic fibroblasts cultured from two knock-in mouse models, we monitored transcription of {beta}-actin and Arc mRNA labeled with MS2 and PP7 stem-loop systems, respectively. After inhibiting transcription initiation, we measured the elongation rate and the termination time by fitting the time trace of transcription intensity with a mathematical model function. We validated our results by comparing them with steady-state fluctuation analysis and stochastic simulations. This live-cell transcription analysis method will be useful for studying the regulation of elongation and termination steps and may provide insight into the diverse mechanisms of transcriptional processes.",

    "abstract": "Extant cnidarians are a disparate phylum of non-bilaterians and their diploblastic body plan represents a key step in animal evolution. Anthozoans (anemones, corals) are benthic polyps, while adult medusozoans (jellyfishes) are dominantly pelagic medusae. A sessile polyp is present in both groups and is widely conceived as the ancestral form of their last common ancestor. However, the nature and anatomy of this ancestral polyp, particularly of medusozoans, are controversial, owing to the divergent body plans of both groups in the extant lineages and the rarity of medusozoan soft tissues in the fossil record. Here we redescribe the enigmatic Conicula striata Luo et Hu from the early Cambrian Chengjiang biota, south China, which has previously been interpreted as a polyp, lophophorate or deuterostome. We show that C. striata possessed features of both anthozoans and medusozoans. Its stalked polyp and fully encasing conical, annulated organic skeleton (periderm) are features of medusozoans. However, the gut is partitioned by [~]28 mesenteries, and has a tubular pharynx, resembling anthozoans. Our phylogenetic analysis recovers C. striata as a stem medusozoan, indicating that the enormously diverse medusozoans were derived from an anemone-like ancestor, with the pharynx lost and number of mesenteries reduced prior to the origin of crown group Medusozoa.",

    "abstract": "The neurobiological mechanisms underlying compulsive alcohol use, a cardinal feature of alcohol use disorder, remain elusive. The key modulator of motivational processes dopamine (DA) is suspected to play an important role in this pathology, but its exact implication remains to be determined. Here, we found that rats expressing compulsive alcohol-related behavior, operationalized as punishment-resistant self-administration, showed a decrease in DA levels restricted to the dorsolateral territories of the striatum, the main output structure of the nigrostriatal DA pathway. We then causally demonstrated that a chemogenetic-induced selective hypodopaminergia of this pathway results in compulsive alcohol self-administration in rats otherwise resilient, accompanied by the emergence of alcohol withdrawal-like motivational impairments. These results demonstrate a major implication of tonic nigrostriatal hypodopaminergic state in alcohol addiction and provide new insights into our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying compulsive alcohol use.",

We show individual Drosophila odor preferences (odor-vs-air and odor-vs-odor) are predicted by idiosyncratic calcium dynamics in olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) and projection neurons (PNs), respectively. Variation in ORN presynaptic density also predicts odor-vs-odor preference. The ORN-PN synapse appears to be a locus of individuality where microscale variation gives rise to idiosyncratic behavior. Finally, simulating microscale stochasticity in ORN-PN synapses of a 3,062 neuron model of the antennal lobe recapitulates patterns of variation in PN calcium responses matching experiments. Our results demonstrate how physiological and microscale structural circuit variations can give rise to individual behavior, even when genetics and environment are held constant.",

Here, we report a self-supervised feature extraction (Selfee) convolutional neural network with multiple downstream applications to process video frames of animal behavior in an end-to-end way. Visualization and classification of the extracted features (Meta-representations) validate that Selfee processes animal behaviors in a comparable way of human understanding. We demonstrate that Meta-representations can be efficiently used to detect anomalous behaviors that are indiscernible to human observation and hint in-depth analysis. Furthermore, time-series analyses of Meta-representations reveal the temporal dynamics of animal behaviors. In conclusion, we present a self-supervised learning approach to extract comprehensive and discriminative features directly from raw video recordings of animal behaviors and demonstrate its potential usage for various downstream applications.",

A total of 120 Bacillus species were isolated from 80 soil samples. However, the phylogenetic tree diverged into two lineages; one belongs to B. subtilis group while the other belongs to B. cereus group. Interestingly, three native strains (SY27.1A, SY35.3A, and SY58.5A), which produce Cry proteins, shared high similarity with B. subtilis group (over 99%) and less than 95% similarity with known B. thuringiensis and other species of B. cereus group. Furthermore, 11 canonical SNPs (canSNPs) were identified in strains that belong to B. pumilus group when compared with B. subtilis reference sequences.\n\nConclusionsPhylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA sequences was found valuable for differentiation between Bacillus species isolated from soil samples. In addition, SNPs analysis provided more intra-specific information in the cases of B. subtilis group.\n\nSignificance and Impact of StudyA detailed analysis was provided for the SNPs present in a conserved region of 16S rRNA gene of Bacillus species. Also, we proposed three novel Bacillus strains that produce Cry proteins and belong to B. subtilis group.",

    "abstract": "A correct understanding of the DNA evolution of drug resistance is critical in developing strategies for suppressing and preventing this process. The Kishony Mega-Plate Experiment demonstrates this important phenomenon that occurs in the practice of medicine, that of the evolution of drug-resistance. The evolutionary process which the bacteria in this experiment are doing is called a Markov Process or Markov Chain. Understanding this process enables clinicians and researchers to predict the evolution of drug-resistance and develop strategies to prevent this process. This paper will show how to apply the Markov Chain model of DNA evolution to the Kishony Mega-Plate Experiment and why the experiment behaves the way it does by contrasting the Jukes-Cantor model of DNA evolution (a stationary model) with a modification of the Jukes-Cantor model that makes it a non-stationary, non-equilibrium Markov Chain. The numerical behaviors of the stationary and non-stationary models are compared. What this analysis shows is that DNA evolution is a non-stationary, non-equilibrium process and that by using the correct non-stationary, non-equilibrium model that one can simulate and predict the behavior of real evolutionary examples and that these analytical tools can give the clinician guidance on how to use antimicrobial selection pressures for treating infectious diseases. This in turn can help reduce the numbers and costs of hospitalization for sepsis, pneumonia and other infectious diseases.",

    "abstract": "Islands, and the particular organisms that populate them, have long fascinated biologists. Due to their isolation, islands offer unique opportunities to study the effect of neutral and adaptive mechanisms in determining genomic and phenotypical divergence. In the Canary Islands, an archipelago rich in endemics, the barn owl (Tyto alba) is thought to have diverged into a subspecies (T. a. gracilirostris) on the eastern islands, Fuerteventura and Lanzarote. Taking advantage of 40 whole-genomes and modern population genomics tools, we provide the first look at the origin and genetic makeup of barn owls of this archipelago. We show that the Canaries hold diverse, long-standing and monophyletic populations with a neat distinction of gene pools from the different islands. Using new method, less sensitive to structure than classical FST, to detect regions involved in local adaptation to the insular environment, we identified a haplotype-like region likely under positive selection in all Canaries individuals. Genes in this region suggest morphological adaptations to insularity. In the eastern islands, where the subspecies T. a. gracilirostris is present, genomic traces of selection pinpoint signs of locally adapted body proportions and blood pressure, consistent with the smaller size of this population living in a hot arid climate. In turn, genomic regions under selection in the western barn owls from Tenerife showed an enrichment in genes linked to hypoxia, a potential response to inhabiting a small island with a marked altitudinal gradient. Our results illustrate the interplay of neutral and adaptive forces in shaping divergence and early onset speciation.",

We devised a novel droplet microfluidics assay to encapsulate single algal microswimmers inside closed arenas, and comprehensively studied their roaming behaviour subject to a large number of environmental stimuli. We compared two model species, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (freshwater alga, 2 cilia), and Pyramimonas octopus (marine alga, 8 cilia), and detailed their highly-stereotyped behaviours and the emergence of a trio of macroscopic swimming states (smooth-forward, quiescent, tumbling or excitable backward). Harnessing ultralong timeseries statistics, we reconstructed the species-dependent reaction network that underlies the choice of locomotor behaviour in these aneural organisms, and discovered the presence of macroscopic non-equilibrium probability fluxes in these active systems. We also revealed for the first time how microswimmer motility changes instantaneously when a chemical is added to their microhabitat, by inducing deterministic fusion between paired droplets - one containing a trapped cell, and the other, a pharmacological agent that perturbs cellular excitability. By coupling single-cell entrapment with unprecedented tracking resolution, speed and duration, our approach offers unique and potent opportunities for diagnostics, drug-screening, and for querying the genetic basis of micro-organismal behaviour.",

Here we show using mouse models of breast cancer caused by the mammary epithelial expression of the Polyoma middle T antigen that there is an increase in the number of circulating and splenic monocytes. In the circulation, cancer does not affect ratios of classical to non-classical populations monocytes nor their halflives. Single cell RNA sequencing also indicates that cancer does not induce any new monocyte populations. In the bone marrow cancer does not change monocytic progenitor number is unaffected but the proliferation rate of monocytes is higher thus providing an explanation for expansion in the circulating number. Deep RNA sequencing of these monocytic populations reveals cancer causes changes in the classical monocyte compartment with changes evident in bone marrow monocytes but more in the blood suggesting influences in both compartments. Down regulation of interferon type 1 signalling and antigen presentation were the most prominent. Consistent with this analysis down regulated genes are enriched with STAT1/STAT2 binding sites in their promoter, transcription factors required for type 1 interferon signalling. However, these transcriptome changes in mice did not replicate those found in patients with breast cancer. Consequently, mouse models of cancer may be insufficient to study the systemic influences of human cancer.",

    "abstract": "Condition-dependent expression of alternative male morphs evolves when males of different sizes experience different mating niches, requiring different morphologies. Such mating niche differentiation can be due to competitive asymmetry between large and small males in contests over mating opportunities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that aggressive interactions among males cause size-structured mating niches in an acarid mite with condition-dependent male polyphenism: the bulb mite Rhizoglyphus robini. In this species, large males mature as armed fighters with enlarged legs, and small males as scramblers without modified legs. We staged experimental dyadic contests over a mating opportunity between either a pair of fighter males, or a fighter and a scrambler male. We predicted that the larger male would have a higher likelihood of mating first in contests among fighters, that the fighter male would have a higher likelihood of mating first in fighter-scrambler contests, that fighters would have a higher likelihood of interrupting ongoing copulations if they are larger than their mating rival, and that copulations in the presence of a fighter rival therefore last shorter than copulations with a scrambler rival present. We found that in contests among fighters, the larger male had a higher probability of mating first. In contests among a fighter and scrambler, the fighter male was more likely to mate first regardless of the body size difference between the contestants. Ongoing copulations were only rarely interrupted by the rival male (always by a fighter), and the probability of interruption did not depend on the body size difference between the mating male and its rival. Copulations lasted shorter in the presence of a rival fighter, but this effect was not attributable to interruption of copulations. We conclude that the fighting niche is particularly accessible for large males, as larger males have a higher probability of winning pre-copulatory contests. Such mating niche differentiation likely contributes to evolutionary maintenance of condition-dependent male polyphenism, where small males are forced to adopt an alternative mating tactic and hence develop a dedicated morphology.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAmplicon sequencing is an established and cost-efficient method for profiling microbiomes. However, many available tools to process this data require both bioinformatics skills and high computational power to process big datasets. Furthermore, there are only few tools that allow for long read amplicon data analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed the LotuS2 (Less OTU Scripts 2) pipeline, enabling user-friendly, resource friendly, and versatile analysis of raw amplicon sequences.\n\nResultsIn LotuS2, six different sequence clustering algorithms as well as extensive pre- and post-processing options allow for flexible data analysis by both experts, where parameters can be fully adjusted, and novices, where defaults are provided for different scenarios. We benchmarked three independent gut and soil datasets, where LotuS2 was on average 29 times faster compared to other pipelines - yet could better reproduce the alpha- and beta-diversity of technical replicate samples. Further benchmarking a mock community with known taxa composition showed that, compared to the other pipelines, LotuS2 recovered a higher fraction of correctly identified genera and species (98% and 57%, respectively). At ASV/OTU level, precision and F-score were highest for LotuS2, as was the fraction of correctly reconstructed 16S sequences.\n\nConclusionLotuS2 is a lightweight and user-friendly pipeline that is fast, precise and streamlined. High data usage rates and reliability enable high-throughput microbiome analysis in minutes.\n\nAvailabilityLotuS2 is available from GitHub, conda or via a Galaxy web interface, documented at http://lotus2.earlham.ac.uk/.",

    "abstract": "Borosins are ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with -N-methylations installed on the peptide backbone that impart unique properties like proteolytic stability to these natural products. The borosin RiPP family was initially reported only in fungi until our recent discovery and characterization of a Type IV split borosin system in the metal-respiring bacterium Shewanella oneidensis. Here, we used hidden Markov models and sequence similarity networks to identify over 1,600 putative pathways that show split borosin biosynthetic gene clusters are widespread in bacteria. Noteworthy differences in precursor and -N-methyltransferase open reading frame sizes, architectures, and core peptide properties allow further subdivision of the borosin family into six additional discrete structural types, of which five have been validated in this study.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",
