    "abstract": "In vivo experimental analysis of human brain tissue poses substantial challenges and ethical concerns. We developed a novel method called the Brain Gene Expression and Network Imputation Engine (BrainGENIE) that uses peripheral-blood transcriptomes to predict brain-tissue-specific gene-expression levels. BrainGENIE reliably predicted brain-tissue-specific expression levels for 1,733 - 11,569 genes (false-discovery rate-adjusted p<0.05), including many transcripts that cannot be predicted reliably by a transcriptome imputation method such as PrediXcan. We tested the generalizability of BrainGENIE in external within-individual data from ex vivo peripheral blood and postmortem brain samples from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project, wherein we validated 39% of predicted gene expression levels as concordant with observed expression levels in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 23% in caudate. BrainGENIE recapitulated diagnosis-related gene expression changes in brain better than direct correlations from blood and predictions from PrediXcan. BrainGENIE complements and, in some ways, outperforms existing transcriptome-imputation tools, providing biologically meaningful predictions and opening new research avenues.",

    "abstract": "In regenerative medicine, the healing of the interfacial zone between tissues is a major challenge, yet approaches for studying the complex microenvironment of this interface remain lacking. Here, we study these complex living interfaces by manufacturing modular \"blocks\" of naturally porous decellularized plant-derived scaffolds with a computer numerical controlled mill. We demonstrate how each scaffold can be seeded with different cell types and easily assembled in a manner akin to LEGO bricks to create an engineered tissue interface (ETI). Cells migrate across the interface formed between an empty scaffold and a scaffold pre-seeded with cells. However, when both scaffolds contain cells, only a shallow cross-over zone of cell infiltration forms at the interface. As a proof-of-concept study, we use ETIs to investigate the interaction between lab grown bone and connective tissues. Consistent with the above, a cross-over zone of the two distinct cell types forms at the interface between scaffolds, otherwise the populations remain distinct. Finally, we demonstrate how ETIs are biocompatible in vivo, becoming vascularized and integrated into surrounding tissue after implantation. This work creates new tissue design avenues for understanding biological processes or the development of synthetic artificial tissues.",

    "abstract": "In an empirical analysis of transposable element (TE) abundance within natural populations of Mimulus guttatus and Drosophila melanogaster, we found a surprisingly high variance of TE count (e.g., variance-to-mean ratio on the order of 10 to 300). To obtain insight regarding those evolutionary genetic mechanisms that are may underlie the overdispersed population distributions of TE abundance, we developed a mathematical model of TE population genetics that includes the dynamics of element proliferation and purifying selection on TE load. The modeling approach begins with a master equation for a birth-death process and extends the predictions of the classical theory of TE dynamics in several ways. In particular, moment-based analyses of time-dependent and equilibrium population distributions of TE load reveal that overdispersion is likely to arise via copy-and-paste proliferation dynamics, especially when the elementary processes of proliferation and excision are first-order and approximately balanced. Parameter studies and analytic work confirm this result and further suggest that overdispersed population distributions of TE abundance are unlikely to be a consequence of purifying selection on total element load.",

    "abstract": "Both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions are regulated by mechanical signals, but the mechanobiological processes that mediate the crosstalk between these structures are poorly understood. Here we show that - catenin, a mechanosensitive protein that is classically associated with cadherin-based adhesions, directly interacts with and regulates integrin adhesions. -catenin is recruited to the edges of mesenchymal cells, where it interacts with F-actin. This is followed by mutual retrograde flow of -catenin and F-actin from the cell edge, during which -catenin interacts with vinculin within integrin adhesions. This interaction affects adhesion maturation, stress-fiber assembly, and force transmission to the matrix. In epithelial cells, -catenin is present in cell-cell adhesions and absent from cell-matrix adhesions. However, when these cells undergo epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, -catenin transitions to cell-matrix adhesions, where it facilitates proper mechanosensing. This is highlighted by the ability of -catenin-depleted cells to grow on soft matrices. These results suggest a dual role of -catenin in mechanosensing, through both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions.",

    "abstract": "The aggresome is a protein turnover system in which proteins are trafficked along microtubules to the centrosome for degradation. Despite extensive focus on aggresomes in immortalized cell lines, it remains unclear if the aggresome is conserved in all primary cells and all cell-states. Here we examined the aggresome in primary adult mouse dermal fibroblasts shifted into four distinct cell-states. We found that in response to proteasome inhibition, quiescent and immortalized fibroblasts formed aggresomes whereas proliferating and senescent fibroblasts did not. Using this model, we generated a resource to better understand the aggresome, providing a characterization of the proteostasis networks in which the aggresome is used and transcriptomic features associated with the presence or absence of aggresome formation. Using this resource, we validate a previously reported role for p38 MAPK signaling in aggresome formation and identify TAK1 as a novel driver of aggresome formation upstream of p38 MAPKs. Together, our data demonstrate that the aggresome is a non-universal protein degradation system which can be used cell-state specifically and provide a resource for better understanding aggresome formation and function.",

    "abstract": "Falls are common in daily life, often caused by trips and slips and, particularly in older adults, with serious consequences. Although arm movements play an important role in balance control, there is limited research into the role of arm movements during balance recovery after tripping in older adults. We investigated how older adults use their arms to recover from a trip and the difference in the effects of arm movements between fallers (n=5) and non-fallers (n=11).\n\nSixteen older males and females (69.7{+/-}2.3 years) walked along a walkway and were occasionally tripped over suddenly appearing obstacles. We analysed the first trip using a biomechanical model based on full-body kinematics and force-plate data to calculate whole body orientation during the trip and recovery phase. With this model, we simulated the effects of arm movements at foot-obstacle impact and during trip recovery on body orientation.\n\nApart from an increase in sagittal plane forward body rotation at touchdown in fallers, we found no significant differences between fallers and non-fallers in the effects of arm movements on trip recovery. Like earlier studies in young adults, we found that arm movements during the recovery phase had most favourable effects in the transverse plane: by delaying the transfer of angular momentum of the arms to the body, older adults rotated the tripped side more forward thereby allowing for a larger recovery step. Older adults that are prone to falling might improve their balance recovery after tripping by learning to prolong ongoing arm movements.",

    "abstract": "Protein-DNA interactions play crucial roles in the biological systems, and identifying protein-DNA binding sites is the first step for mechanistic understanding of various biological activities (such as transcription and repair) and designing novel drugs. How to accurately identify DNA-binding residues from only protein sequence remains a challenging task. Currently, most existing sequence-based methods only consider contextual features of the sequential neighbors, which are limited to capture spatial information. Based on the recent breakthrough in protein structure prediction by AlphaFold2, we propose an accurate predictor, GraphSite, for identifying DNA-binding residues based on the structural models predicted by AlphaFold2. Here, we convert the binding site prediction problem into a graph node classification task and employ a transformer-based variant model to take the protein structural information into account. By leveraging predicted protein structures and graph transformer, GraphSite substantially improves over the latest sequence-based and structure-based methods. The algorithm is further confirmed on the independent test set of 181 proteins, where GraphSite surpasses the state-of-the-art structure-based method by 16.4% in AUPR and 11.2% in MCC, respectively. We provide the datasets, the predicted structures, and the source codes along with the pre-trained models of GraphSite at https://github.com/biomed-AI/GraphSite.

    "abstract": "Mitochondria contain their own genome that can be released in multiple biofluids such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, as cell-free mitochondrial DNA (cf-mtDNA). In clinical studies, single measures of blood cf-mtDNA predict mortality, and higher cf-mtDNA levels are associated with mental and physical stress. However, the dynamics of cf-mtDNA has not been defined, and whether it can be measured non-invasively like other neuroendocrine markers in saliva has not been examined. Here we report cf-mtDNA in human saliva and establish its natural within-person dynamic behavior across multiple weeks. In a small proof-of-principle cohort of healthy adults, we first develop an approach to rapidly quantify salivary cf-mtDNA without DNA extraction, and demonstrate the existence of saliva cf-mtDNA. We then deploy this approach to perform an intensive repeated-measures analysis of two healthy men studied at 4 daily timepoints over 53-60 consecutive days (n=212-220 observations each) with parallel measures of steroid hormones, self-reported daily mood, and health-related behaviors. Salivary cf-mtDNA exhibited a robust awakening response reaching up to two orders of magnitude 30-45 minutes after awakening, varied from day-to-day, and moderately correlated with the cortisol awakening response. No consistent association with self-reported daily mood/health-related behaviors were found, although this requires further examination in more extensive studies. Dynamic variation in cf-mtDNA was inversely related with salivary interleukin 6 (IL6), inconsistent with a pro-inflammatory effect of salivary cf-mtDNA. The highly dynamic behavior of salivary cf-mtDNA opens the door to non-invasive studies examining the relevance of mtDNA signaling in relation to human health.",

    "abstract": "Herbivorous reef fishes are critically important for maintaining the health and resilience of coral reefs. In the Egyptian Gulf of Aqaba (GoA), many of these herbivores are important fishery targets, however, little is known about their biomass and size structure patterns. Here, we conduct a large-scale ([~]250 km of coastline) assessment of the status of herbivorous fish populations on 30 reef sites from eight coastal regions in the GoA. These regions are subjected to three levels of fishing and protection, ranging from almost no fishing (No-take, NT), and moderately fished (via Gear-restriction, GR) to heavily fished (Open-access, OA). We found that the NT fishery reserve was the most effective in maintaining herbivorous fish richness, body-size, and biomass across all functional groups, though numerical density was not. Total herbivore biomass was 4.3 and 2.8 times higher on NT reefs and GR reefs respectively than on OA reefs. Among GoA regions, only Ras Mohammed and Sharm El-Sheikh (unfished), and Nabq (moderately fished) met the global mean herbivore biomass target of [~]30 kg/500 m2. Our work also highlights three important results regarding the impacts of fishing and fisheries management on herbivorous fish populations: (i) size structure was heavily skewed toward smaller individuals, with fishes less than (20 cm) accounting for 81.1% of the population in heavily fished OA reefs vs. 52.8% at unfished NT reefs, (ii) biomass of larger herbivore individuals (>35 cm) accounted for less than 1% of the total biomass in OA reefs vs. 37% at NT reefs, and (iii) large-bodied target species, Cetoscarus bicolor, Naso unicorn, and Kyphosus spp., accounting for 15.9% of the total biomass at NT reefs on average, while they were virtually absent from OA reefs. Collectively, these findings suggest that many principal fishery species in the central-northern regions of the GoA have been overexploited, which in turn can lead to reef degradation. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a participatory management approach and enforce restrictions on destructive fishing gear in order to promote recovery of herbivore biomass.\n\nHighlightsO_LILarge-scale assessment of the status of herbivorous fishes in the northern Red Sea.\nC_LIO_LIComparison of herbivorous fish assemblages across three levels of fishing pressure.\nC_LIO_LILarge-bodied herbivore species were either rare or absent at heavily fished reefs.\nC_LIO_LILoss of these key herbivores may boost algal dominance, thus diminish reef functionality.\nC_LIO_LIPromoting local community participation in the fishery management process.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) induces regression of recurrent and advanced prostate cancer (PrCa), but many tumors recur. To understand the response to ADT, changes in tumor volume were imaged after castration of murine PrCa models. While mouse (non-tumor) prostate begins to regress within two days of castration, murine PrCa regresses after a delay of 3-14 days in two distinct mouse models. Intra-tumoral androgens are undetectable after castration, but tumor cells proliferate during this period. Intratumoral glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein increase, as does GR mRNA and a set of GR-regulated genes specifically in tumor epithelial cells identified using scRNAseq. A selective GR antagonist (CORT125281, relacorilant), in clinical trials for late-state PrCa, eliminates the delayed regression phenotype in both models. Thus, activated GR signaling and murine tumor proliferation following castration resembles the GR-dependent escape mechanism of castrate resistant PrCa. These results suggest simultaneous inhibition of GR and androgen receptor signaling could improve PrCa therapy.\n\nIn briefAndrogen deprivation therapy for high risk and recurrent prostate cancers is initially effective, but ultimately fails; better understanding the mechanisms should improve therapy. In two murine prostate cancer models, GR signaling is activated immediately following castration, substituting for the acute reduction in AR signaling, and allowing for continued tumor growth. This continued growth is blocked by relacorilant, selective GR antagonist in clinical trials for late-state PrCa.\n\nHighlightsO_LIAndrogen deprivation therapy induces regression of prostate cancer, but tumors recur\nC_LIO_LIMurine PrCa continues to proliferate for 3-14 days in two distinct mouse prostate cancer models\nC_LIO_LITumor cells proliferate during this period, and intratumoral glucocorticoids and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein increase, as does GR mRNA and a set of GR-regulated genes\nC_LIO_LIRelacorilant, a selective GR antagonist in clinical trials for late-state PrCa, eliminates the delayed regression\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Group living animals can use social and asocial cues to predict the presence of a reward or a punishment in the environment through associative learning. The degree to which social and asocial learning share the same mechanisms is still a matter of debate, and, so far, studies investigating the neuronal basis of these two types of learning are scarce and have been restricted to primates, including humans, and rodents. Here we have used a Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigm in which a social (fish image) or an asocial (circle image) conditioned stimulus (CS) have been paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US=food), and we have used the expression of the immediate early gene c-fos to map the neural circuits associated with social and asocial learning. Our results show that the learning performance is similar with social (fish image) and asocial (circle image) CSs. However, the brain regions involved in each learning type are distinct. Social learning is associated with an increased expression of c-fos in olfactory bulbs, ventral zone of ventral telencephalic area, ventral habenula and ventromedial thalamus, whereas asocial learning is associated with a decreased expression of c-fos in dorsal habenula and anterior tubercular nucleus. Using egonetworks, we further show that each learning type has an associated pattern of functional connectivity across brain regions. Moreover, a community analysis of the network data reveals four segregated functional submodules, which seem to be associated with different cognitive functions involved in the learning tasks: a generalized attention module, a visual response module, a social stimulus integration module and a learning module. Together, these results suggest that, although there are localized differences in brain activity between social and asocial learning, the two learning types share a common learning module and social learning also recruits a specific social stimulus integration module. Therefore, our results support the occurrence of a common general-purpose learning module, that is differentially modulated by localized activation in social and asocial learning.",

    "abstract": "In most experiments within the field of cognitive and systems neuroscience, fixation is often required prior to the onset of an experimental trial. However, the term \"fixation\" is rather misleading since our eyes are constantly moving. One type of transient miniature movement ubiquitously observed during fixation is commonly referred to as fixational eye movements or microsaccades. Perimicrosaccadic compression of visual space -- the ability of retinotopic cells to transiently exhibit predictive spatiotemporal retinotopic compressive shifts toward the target of an impending microsaccade -- is known to dramatically alter visual perception. However, whether perimicrosaccadic compressive shifts can become spatially asymmetric, that is, continuously directed toward a specific foveal region over another (e.g., an upper over a lower region in the fovea) and for what purpose, remains poorly understood. Assuming that these transient shifts are indeed asymmetric under certain conditions, the perceptual and oculomotor consequences such asymmetricity might accompany across visual space is poorly understood. Equally unaccounted for is a mechanistic account of the neural computation and architecture that could support these transient asymmetric shifts while the visual system actively maintains retinotopic organization. Here, we systematically measured visual sensitivity in human subjects to faint probes presented during fixation and around the time of saccadic eye movement at geometrically symmetric retinotopic locations in the foveal, parafoveal, and peripheral regions of visual space. Remarkably, we observed transient local asymmetric visual sensitivity differences between these symmetric retinotopic locations where none should be observed. Equally surprising, we observed the trajectories of saccadic eye movements, which are expected to travel along a linear path, routinely deviate along a curved path toward orthogonal eccentric locations. To provide a mechanistic account of the neural computation and architecture that may explain our results, we proposed a novel neurobiologically inspired phenomenological force field model in which underlying attentional and oculomotor signals are modulated by transient eccentric error signals that manifest as temporally overlapping predictive forces and impinge on the retinotopic visual cortex. These forces, which transiently bias putative population sensitivity toward an orthogonal retinotopic foveal region and, around the time of a saccadic eye movement, along an axis orthogonal to the saccade direction toward a mislocalized peripheral region, succinctly capture the essence of our empirical observations.",

With 5000 photons detected from Nile red (NR) transiently bound within supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), raPol SMOLM achieves 2.9 nm localization precision, 1.5{degrees} orientation precision, and 0.17 sr precision in estimating rotational wobble. Within DPPC SLBs, SMOLM imaging reveals the existence of randomly oriented binding pockets that prevent NR from freely exploring all orientations. Treating the SLBs with cholesterol-loaded methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (M{beta}CD-chol) causes NRs orientational diffusion to be dramatically reduced, but curiously, NRs median lateral displacements drastically increase from 20.8 nm to 75.5 nm (200 ms time lag). These jump diffusion events overwhelmingly originate from cholesterol-rich nanodomains within the SLB. These detailed measurements of single-molecule rotational and translational dynamics are made possible by raPols high measurement precision and are not detectable in standard SMLM.",

    "abstract": "Coral reefs around the world are under threat from anomalous heat waves that are causing the widespread decline of hard corals. Different coral taxa are known to have different sensitivities to heat, although variation in susceptibilities have also been observed within the same species living in different environments. Characterizing such taxa-specific variations is key to enforcing efficient reef conservation strategies.\n\nHere, we combine worldwide-reef-survey data with remote sensed environmental variables to evaluate how local differences in taxa-specific coral cover are associated with past trends of thermal anomalies, as well as of non-heat related conditions. While the association with non-heat related environmental variation was seldom significant, we found that heat stress trends matched local differences in coral cover. Coral taxa were sorted based on the different patterns of associations with heat stress.\n\nFor branching, tabular and corymbose Acroporidae, reefs exposed to recent heat stress (measured the year before the survey) had lower coral cover than locally expected; and among these reefs, those previously exposed to frequent past heat stress (measured since 1985) displayed relatively higher coral cover, compared to those less frequently exposed. For massive and encrusting Poritidae, and for meandroid Favidae and Mussidae, we observed a negative association of coral cover with recent heat stress; however, unlike with Acroporidae, these associations were weaker and did not vary with past heat exposure. For Pocilloporidae, we found a positive association between coral cover and recent heat stress for reefs frequently exposed to past heat, while we found a negative association at reefs less frequently exposed to past heat. A similar pattern was observed for the branching Poritidae, although the associations were weaker and not statistically significant.\n\nOverall, these results show taxa-specific heat association patterns that might correspond to taxa-specific responses to past heat exposure, such as shifts in the assembly of coral communities, evolutionary adaptation or physiological acclimation.",

    "abstract": "Urbanization and deforestation impose severe challenges to wildlife, particularly for forest-living vertebrates. Understanding how the peri-urban matrix impacts their survival is critical for designing strategies to promote their conservation. We investigated the threats faced by brown howler monkeys (Alouatta guariba clamitans) in peri-urban regions of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and Santa Catarina (SC) states, southern Brazil, by compiling negative interaction events (hereafter NIE) reported over more than two decades. We assessed the major NIEs, their distribution among age-sex classes, and the predictors of NIE-related mortality. After 20+ years of monitoring, we compiled 540 NIEs (RS = 248 and SC = 292). Electrocution by power lines was the most frequent cause of death or injury (37%), followed by dog attack (34%), vehicle collision (17%), and human mistreatment (12%). The occurrence of lethal injuries ranged from 5% to 69% depending on the type of NIE and on which state it occurred in. The overall post-NIE mortality was 56%. Adults of both sexes were the most affected individuals in both study regions. The minimal adequate GLM model explained 83% of the variation in NIE-related mortality. State, NIE type, and age-sex class were the main predictors of mortality. Overall, mortality was lower in SC and higher among adult females than in the other classes. We found that the survival of brown howler monkeys in the forest-urban interface is constrained by both the urban infrastructure and the growing interactions with humans and domestic and stray dogs (Canis familiaris). We propose the placement of aerial bridges, road signs and speed bumps in areas of frequent animal crossing, the sterilization of stray dogs, and the sensitization of local inhabitants on the importance of respecting and protecting wildlife to reduce their NIEs with humans and domestic animals in the forest-urban interface.",

    "abstract": "Bitter taste receptors (T2Rs) are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed in various cell types including ciliated airway epithelial cells and macrophages. T2Rs in these two airway innate immune cell types are activated by bitter products, including some secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, leading to Ca2+-dependent activation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS). NO enhances mucociliary clearance and has direct antibacterial effects in ciliated epithelial cells and increases phagocytosis by macrophages. Using biochemistry and live cell imaging, we explored the role of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) in regulating T2R-dependent NO pathways in primary sinonasal epithelial cells, primary monocyte-derived macrophages, and a human bronchiolar cell line (H441). We used immunofluorescence to show that H441 cells express eNOS and certain T2Rs and that the bitterant denatonium benzoate activates NO production in an HSP90-dependent manner in cells grown either as submerged cultures and at air liquid interface. In primary sinonasal epithelial cells, we determined that HSP-90 inhibition reduces T2R-stimulated NO production and ciliary beating which are crucial for pathogen clearance. In primary monocyte-derived macrophages, we found that HSP-90 is integral to T2R-stimulated NO production and phagocytosis of FITC-labeled Escherichia coli and pHrodo-Staphylococcus aureus. Our study demonstrates that HSP90 serves an innate immune role by regulating NO production downstream of T2R signaling by augmenting eNOS activation without impairing upstream calcium signaling. These findings suggest that HSP90 plays an important role in airway antibacterial innate immunity and may be an important target in airway diseases like chronic rhinosinusitis, asthma, or cystic fibrosis.",

In the present study, we investigated the functionality of macaque metacognition by combining a confidence proxy, hierarchical Bayesian meta-d' computational modelling, and a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation technique. We found that Brodmann area 46d (BA46d) played a critical role in supporting metacognition independent of task performance; we also found that the critical role of this region in meta-calculation was time-sensitive. Additionally, we report that macaque metacognition is highly domain-specific with respect to memory and perception decisions.

    "abstract": "Cellular development is orchestrated by evolutionarily conserved signaling pathways, which are often pleiotropic and involve intra- and inter-pathway epistatic interactions that form intricate, complex regulatory networks. Cryptococcus species are a group of closely-related human fungal pathogens that grow as yeasts yet transition to hyphae during sexual reproduction. Additionally, during infection they can form large, polyploid titan cells that evade immunity and develop drug resistance. Multiple known signaling pathways regulate cellular development, yet how these are coordinated and interact with genetic variation is less well understood. Here, we conducted quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses of a mapping population generated by sexual reproduction of two parents, only one of which is unisexually fertile. We observed transgressive segregation of the unisexual phenotype among progeny, as well as a novel large-cell phenotype under mating-inducing conditions. These large-cell progeny were found to produce titan cells both in vitro and in infected animals. Two major QTLs and corresponding quantitative trait genes (QTGs) were identified: RIC8 (encoding a guanine-exchange factor) and CNC06490 (encoding a putative Rho-GTPase activator), both involved in G-protein signaling. The two QTGs interact epistatically with each other and with the mating-type locus in phenotypic determination. These findings provide insights into the complex genetics of morphogenesis during unisexual reproduction and pathogenic titan cell formation and illustrate how QTL analysis can be applied to identify epistasis between genes. This study shows that phenotypic outcomes are influenced by the genetic background upon which mutations arise, implicating dynamic, complex genotype-to-phenotype landscapes in fungal pathogens and beyond.\n\nSignificance statementCellular development is regulated by a complex web of signaling pathways that respond to both intracellular and extracellular cues. Morphological transitions in pathogenic fungi, such as those observed during sexual reproduction or in response to the host environment, offer tractable models for understanding the principles that govern eukaryotic cell development and morphogenesis. Using the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus deneoformans as a model and applying QTL analysis, we defined novel genes and gene-gene interactions involved in the yeast-hyphal transition and titanization, two morphological developments that are important for adaptation, pathogenesis, and evolution of this fungal pathogen. Our study provides new insights into the conservation and complexity of key signaling pathways in regulating cell development in fungi, as well as other eukaryotes.",

Integrating enteroblasts must generate a new apical domain and break through the septate junctions between neighbouring enterocytes, while maintaining barrier function. We observe that enteroblasts form an apical membrane initiation site when they reach the septate junction between the overlying enterocytes. A space appears above the enteroblast as Cadherin clears from its apical surface. New septate junctions then form laterally with neighbouring enterocytes and the AMIS develops into pre-apical compartment with a fully-formed brush border. Finally, the overlying septate junction dissolves and the pre-enterocyte reaches the gut lumen. Enteroblasts therefore form an apical domain before they have a free apical surface. The process of enteroblast integration resembles lumen formation in mammalian epithelial cysts, highlighting the similarities between the fly midgut and mammalian epithelia.",

The Innovation and Quality (IQ) consortium formed by multiple pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to confront this challenge has published guidelines that define criteria for qualifying preclinical models, however, systematic and quantitative evaluation of the predictive value of Organ-Chips has not yet been reported. Here, 870 Liver-Chips were analyzed to determine their ability to predict drug-induced liver injury (DILI) caused by small molecules identified as benchmarks by the IQ consortium. The Liver-Chip met the qualification guidelines across a blinded set of 27 known hepatotoxic and non-toxic drugs with a sensitivity of 87% and a specificity of 100%. A computational economic value analysis suggests that with this performance the Liver-Chip could generate $3 billion annually for the pharmaceutical industry due to increased R&D productivity.",

    "abstract": "Human behavior requires interregional crosstalk to employ the sensorimotor processes in the brain. Although some external neuromodulation tools have been used to manipulate interhemispheric sensorimotor activity, a central controversy concerns whether this activity can be volitionally controlled. Experimental tools lack the power to up- or down-regulate the state of the targeted hemisphere over a large dynamic range and, therefore, cannot evaluate the possible volitional control of the activity. We overcame this difficulty by using the recently developed method of spatially bivariate electroencephalography (EEG)-neurofeedback to systematically enable participants to manipulate their bilateral sensorimotor activities. Herein, we report that bi-directional changes in ipsilateral excitability to the imagined hand (conditioning hemisphere) affect interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) assessed by paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation paradigm. In addition, participants were able to robustly manipulate the IHI magnitudes. Further physiological analyses revealed that the self-manipulation of IHI magnitude reflected interhemispheric connectivity in EEG and TMS, which was accompanied by intrinsic bilateral cortical oscillatory activities. Our results provide clear neuroscientific evidence regarding the inhibitory interhemispheric sensorimotor activity and IHI manipulator, thereby challenging the current theoretical concept of recovery of motor function for neurorehabilitation.",

    "abstract": "Rapid assessment of whether a pandemic pathogen may have increased transmissibility or be capable of evading existing vaccines and therapeutics is critical to mounting an effective public health response. Over the period of seven days, we utilized rapid computational prediction methods to evaluate potential public health implications of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant. Specifically, we modeled the structure of the Omicron variant, examined its interface with human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) and evaluated the change in binding affinity between Omicron, ACE-2 and publicly known neutralizing antibodies. We also compared the Omicron variant to known Variants of Concern (VoC). Seven of the 15 Omicron mutations occurring in the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) occur at the ACE-2 cell receptor interface, and therefore may play a critical role in enhancing binding to ACE-2. Our estimates of Omicron RBD-ACE-2 binding affinities indicate that at least two of RBD mutations, Q493R and N501Y, contribute to enhanced ACE-2 binding, nearly doubling delta-delta-G (ddG) free energies calculated for other VoCs. Binding affinity estimates also were calculated for 55 known neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Analysis of the results showed that Omicron substantially degrades binding for more than half of these neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and for roughly 10 times as many of the antibodies than the currently dominant Delta variant. This early study lends support to use of rapid computational risk assessments to inform public health decision-making while awaiting detailed experimental characterization and confirmation.",

    "abstract": "Since next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become widely available, large gene panels containing up to several hundred genes can be sequenced cost-efficiently. However, the interpretation of the often large numbers of sequence variants detected when using NGS is laborious, prone to errors and often not comparable across laboratories. To overcome this challenge, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and the Association for Molecular Pathology (ACMG/AMP) introduced standards and guidelines for the interpretation of sequencing variants. Further gene- and disease-specific refinements regarding hereditary hearing loss have been developed since then. With more than 200 genes associated with hearing disorders, the manual inspection of possible causative variants is especially difficult and time consuming. We developed an open-source bioinformatics tool GenOtoScope, which automates all ACMG/AMP criteria that can be assessed without further individual patient information or human curator investigation, including the refined loss of function criterion (\"PVS1\"). Two types of interfaces are provided: (i) a command line application to classify sequence variants in batches for a set of patients and (ii) a user-friendly website to classify single variants. We compared the performance of our tool with two other variant classification tools using two hearing loss data sets, which were manually annotated either by the ClinGen Hearing Loss Gene Curation Expert Panel or the diagnostics unit of our human genetics department. GenOtoScope achieved the best average accuracy and precision for both data sets. Compared to the second-best tool, GenOtoScope improved accuracy metric by 25.75% and 4.57% and precision metric by 52.11% and 12.13% on the two data sets respectively. The web interface is freely accessible. The command line application along with all source code, documentation and example outputs can be found via the project GitHub page.\n\nAuthor summaryNew high-throughput sequencing technologies can produce massive amounts of information and are utilized by laboratories to explain the often complex genetic aetiology of hereditary diseases. The most common sensory disease, hearing loss, is often hereditary and has a high impact on a patients every-day life. To use these sequencing technologies effectively, software tools were developed that can aid researchers interpreting genetic data by semi-automatically classifying the biologic (and thus potentially medical) impact of detected variants (the alterations of the patients genome compared to the human reference genome). The available genetic variant classification tools are either not designed specifically for the interpretation of variants detected in subjects with hearing loss or they do not allow researchers to use them for batch classification of all variants detected, e. g. in a study group. To address this drawback, we developed GenOtoScope, an open-source tool that automates the pathogenicity classification of variants potentially associated with congenital hearing loss. GenOtoScope can be applied for the automatic classification of all variants detected in a set of probands.",

The present study reports that oncomodulin (ONCM) is produced from the regeneration-associated macrophages (RAMs) and strongly influences regeneration of DRG sensory axons. Preconditioning injury upregulated ONCM in DRG macrophages in a CCR2 dependent manner. ONCM in macrophages was necessary to produce RAMs in the in vitro model of neuron-macrophage interaction and played an essential role in for preconditioning or CCL2-induced neurite outgrowth. ONCM potently increased neurite outgrowth in cultured DRG neurons by activating a distinct gene set, particularly neuropeptide-related genes. Increasing extracellularly secreted ONCM in DRGs sufficiently enhanced capacity of neurite outgrowth. To achieve sustained ONCM activity in vivo, recombinant ONCM was encapsulated by a reducible epsilon-poly(L-lysine)-nanogel (REPL-NG) system based on electrostatic interaction. Localized injection of REPL-NG/ONCM complex into DRGs achieved a remarkable long-range axonal regeneration beyond spinal cord lesion, surpassing the extent of the preconditioning effects.",

In particular, the impact of TBI on the differentiation and maintenance of dendritic cells (DCs), remains completely unknown.

Our studies identify that; 1. frequencies and absolute numbers of DCs in the spleen and BM are altered at both acute and late phases of TBI; 2. surface expression of key molecules involved in antigen presentation of DCs were affected both at early and late phases of TBI; 3. distribution and functions of tissue-specific DC subsets of both circulatory and lymphatic systems were imbalanced following TBI; 4. early differentiation program of DCs, especially the commitment of hematopoietic stem cells to common DC progenitors, were deregulated after TBI; and 5. intracellular ROS levels were reduced in DC progenitors and differentiated DCs at both early and late phases of TBI. Our data demonstrate, for the first time, that TBI affects the distribution pattern of DCs and induces an imbalance among DC subsets in both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs. In addition, the current study demonstrates that TBI results in reduced levels of ROS in DCs at both early and late phases of TBI, which may explain altered DC differentiation paradigm following TBI. A deeper understanding on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to DC defects following TBI would be essential and beneficial in treating infections in patients with acute central nervous system (CNS) injuries.",

Giant cell tumours of bone (GCTs) are characterised by a mutated histone H3.3 as the sole genetic driver present in bone-forming osteoprogenitor cells but absent from abnormally large bone-resorbing osteoclasts which represent the hallmark of these neoplasms. While these striking features imply a pathogenic interaction between mesenchymal and myelomonocytic lineages during GCT development, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.\n\nWe show that the changes in the transcriptome and epigenome in the mesenchymal cells caused by the H3.3-G34W mutation contribute to increase osteoclast recruitment in part via reduced expression of the TGF{beta}-like soluble factor, SCUBE3. In turn, osteoclasts secrete unregulated amounts of SEMA4D enhancing proliferation of mutated osteoprogenitors and arresting their maturation. These findings provide a mechanism by which GCTs undergo differentiation upon denosumab treatment, a drug that depletes osteoclasts. In contrast, gain of hTERT activity, commonly found in malignant GCT, makes neoplastic cells insensitive to osteoclasts, predicting the unresponsiveness to denosumab.\n\nWe provide a mechanism for GCT initiation and its response to current treatment, the basis of which is dysfunctional cross-talk between bone-forming and bone-resorbing cells, emphasising the importance of tumor/microenvironment bidirectional interactions in tumorigenesis.",

Deinococcus species have a complex cell envelope composed of L-ornithine containing peptidoglycan. Anabolism of L-ornithine is intrinsically linked to L-lysine and L-arginine biosynthetic pathways. To understand these two pathways, we analyzed the L-lysine and L-arginine pathways using 23 Deinococcus genomes, including D. indicus. We used BLAST-P based ortholog identification using D. radiodurans genes as the query. We identified some BLAST-P hits that shared the same functional annotation. We analyzed three (class I aminotransferase, acetyl-lysine deacetylase, and acetyl glutamate/acetyl aminoadipate kinase) from L-lysine biosynthesis pathway and three (bifunctional ornithine acetyltransferase or N-acetyl glutamate synthase protein, nitric oxide synthase-like protein, and Acetyl-lysine deacetylase) from L-arginine biosynthesis pathway. Two proteins showed certain structural variations. Specifically, [LysW]-lysine hydrolase proteins sequence and structure level changes indicated changes in oligomeric conformation, which could likely be a result of divergent evolution. And, bifunctional ornithine acetyltransferase or N-acetyl glutamate synthase had its active site pocket positions shifted at the structural level and we hypothesize that it may not perform at the optimal level. Thus, we were able to compare and contrast different Deinococcus species indicating some genes occurring because of divergent evolution.",

Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) plays a prominent role in mediating metastatic behavior by promoting epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes. Migratory melanoma cells exhibit two major phenotypes: elongated mesenchymal or rounded amoeboid. The actomyosin cytoskeleton is key in both phenotypes, but intermediate filaments also undergo a significant rearrangement process, switching from cytokeratin-rich to vimentin and nestin-rich network. In this study, we aimed to investigate to what extent YB-1 impacts the biomechanical (cell stiffness) and biochemical aspects of melanoma cells and their cytoskeleton. To this end, we subjected A375 YB-1 knock-out and parental cells to atomic force microscopy investigations (stiffness determination), immunolabelling, and proteome analysis. We found that YB-1 expressing cells were significantly stiffer compared to the corresponding YB-1 knock-out cell line. Proteomic analysis revealed that expression of YB-1 results in a strong co-expression of nestin, vimentin, fascin-1, and septin-9. In the YB-1 knock-out nestin was completely depleted, but zyxin was strongly upregulated. Collectively, our results showed that YB-1 knock-out acquires some characteristics of mesenchymal phenotype but lacks important markers of malignancy and invasiveness such as nestin or vimentin. We posit that there is an association of YB-1 expression with an amoeboid phenotype, which would explain the increased migratory capacity.",

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the systemic manifestation of cancer and the main cause of death from breast cancer. In mouse models of lung metastases, recruitment of classical monocytes from blood to the lung and their differentiation to metastasis-associated macrophages (MAMs) facilitate cancer cell extravasation, survival, and growth. Ablation of MAMs or their monocytic progenitors inhibits metastasis. We hypothesized that factors controlling macrophage polarization modulate tumor cell extravasation in the lung. We evaluated whether signaling by Th1 or Th2 cytokines in macrophages affected trans-endothelial migration of tumor cells in vitro. Interferon {gamma} and LPS inhibited macrophage-dependent tumor cell extravasation while the Th2 cytokine interleukin-4 (IL4) enhanced this process. We demonstrated that IL4 receptor (IL4r) null mice develop fewer and smaller lung metastasis. Adoptive transfer of wild type monocytes to IL4r deficient mice rescued this phenotype. IL4 signaling in macrophages controls the expression of the chemokine receptor CXCR2, necessary for IL4-mediated tumor cell extravasation in vitro. Furthermore, IL4 signaling in macrophages transcriptionally regulates several other genes already causally associated with lung metastasis including CCL2, CSF1, CCR1, HGF and FLT1. The central role for IL4 signaling in MAMs was confirmed by high-resolution intravital imaging of the lung in mice at the time of metastatic seeding, which showed reduced physical interaction between tumor cells and IL4r-deficient macrophages. This interaction enhances tumor cell survival. These data indicate that IL4 signaling in monocytes and macrophages is key during seeding and growth of breast metastasis in the lung as it regulates pro-tumoral paracrine signaling between cancer cells and macrophages.",

    "abstract": "The combination of image analysis and fluorescence superresolution microscopy methods allows for unprecedented insight into the organization of macromolecular assemblies in cells. Advances in deep learning-based object recognition enables the automated processing of large amounts of data, resulting in high accuracy through averaging. However, while the analysis of highly symmetric structures of constant size allows for a resolution approaching the dimensions of structural biology, deep learning methods are prone to different forms of bias. A biased recognition of structures may prohibit the development of readouts for processes that involve significant changes in size or shape of amorphous macromolecular complexes. What is required to overcome this problem is a detailed investigation of potential sources of bias and the rigorous testing of trained models using real or simulated data covering a wide dynamic range of possible results. Here we combine single molecule localization-based superresolution microscopy of septin ring structures with the training of several different deep learning models for a quantitative investigation of bias resulting from different training approaches and finally quantitative changes in septin ring structures. We find that trade-off exists between measurement accuracy and the dynamic range of recognized phenotypes. Using our trained models, we furthermore find that septin ring size can be explained by the number of subunits they are assembled from alone. Our work provides a new experimental system for the investigation of septin polymerization.",

    "abstract": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a human tumor virus, which preferentially infects resting human B cells. Upon infection in vitro, EBV activates and immortalizes these cells. The viral latent protein EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) 2 is essential for B cell activation and immortalization; it targets and binds the cellular and ubiquitously expressed DNA binding protein CBF1, thereby transactivating a plethora of viral and cellular genes. In addition, EBNA2 uses its N-terminal dimerization (END) domain to bind early B cell factor (EBF) 1, a pioneer transcription factor specifying the B cell lineage. We found that EBNA2 exploits EBF1 to support key metabolic processes and to foster cell cycle progression of infected B cells in their first cell cycles upon activation. An 1-helix within the END domain was found to promote EBF1 binding. EBV mutants lacking the 1-helix in EBNA2 can infect and activate B cells efficiently, but the activated cells fail to complete the early S phase of their initial cell cycle. Expression of MYC, target genes of MYC and E2F as well as multiple metabolic processes linked to cell cycle progression are impaired in EBV{Delta}1 infected B cells. Our findings indicate that EBF1 controls B cell activation via EBNA2 and, thus, has a critical role in regulating the cell cycle of EBV infected B cells. This is a function of EBF1 going beyond its well-known contribution to B cell lineage specification.\n\nSignificance statementEpstein-Barr virus (EBV) infects primary B cells and establishes life-long latent infection in these cells. EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) 2 drives early processes of B cell activation and cell cycle entry. The surface of the N-terminal dimerization domain of EBNA2 exposes a five amino acid -helix (1) that recruits EBF1 to activate MYC and downstream targets of both MYC and E2F to support critical metabolic processes in infected B cells and to drive them through S phase in the first cell cycle post-infection. Our study demonstrates how EBNA2 exploits EBF1, a key factor of B cell lineage specification to initiate proliferation and high-lights the 1-helix as a potential Achilles heel of the virus at the stage when latent infection is established.",

    "abstract": "DNA polymerases have evolved to feature a highly conserved activity across the tree of life: formation of, without exception, phosphodiester linkages that create the repeating sugarphosphate backbone of DNA. Can this linkage selectivity observed in nature be overcome by design to produce non-natural nucleic acids? Here, we report that structure-guided redesign of an archaeal DNA polymerase (9{degrees}N) enables a new polymerase activity that is undetectable in the wild type enzyme: catalyzing the formation of N3[-&gt;]P5 phosphoramidate linkages in the presence of 3-amino-2,3-dideoxynucleoside 5-triphosphate (3-NH2-ddNTP) building blocks. Replacing a highly conserved metal-binding aspartate in the 9{degrees}N active site (Asp-404) with asparagine was key to the emergence of this unnatural enzyme activity. Molecular dynamics simulations provided insights into how a single substitution could enhance the productive positioning of the 3-amino nucleophile in the active site. Further remodeling of the protein-nucleic acid interface with substitutions in the finger subdomain led to a quadruple-mutant variant (9{degrees}N-NRQS) that incorporated 3-NH2-ddNTPs into a 3-amino-primer on various DNA templates. This work presents the first example of an active-site substitution of a metal-binding residue that leads to a novel activity in a DNA polymerase, and sheds light on the molecular basis of substrate fidelity and latent promiscuity in enzymes.",

    "abstract": "In a way analogous to human vision, the fruit fly D. melanogaster and many other flying insects generate smooth and saccadic movements to stabilize and shift their gaze in flight, respectively. It has been hypothesized that this combination of continuous and discrete movements benefits both flight stability and performance, particularly at high frequencies or speeds [1]. Here we develop a hybrid control system model to explore the effects of saccades on the yaw stabilization reflex of D. melanogaster. Inspired from experimental data, the model includes a first order plant, a Proportional-Integral (PI) continuous controller, and a saccadic reset system that fires based on the integrated error of the continuous controller. We explore the gain, delay and switching threshold parameter space to quantify the optimum regions for stability and performance. We show that the addition of saccades to a continuous controller provides benefits to both stability and performance across a range of frequencies. Our model suggests that Drosophila operates near its optimal switching threshold for its experimental gain set. We also show that based on experimental data, D. melanogaster operates in a region that trades off performance and stability. This trade-off increases flight robustness to compensate for environmental uncertainties such as wing damage.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 has forced rapid clinical translation of novel vaccine technologies, principally mRNA vaccines, that have resulted in meaningful efficacy and adequate safety in response to the global pandemic. Notwithstanding this success, there remains an opportunity for innovation in vaccine technology to address current limitations and meet the challenges of inevitable future pandemics. We describe a universal vaccine cell (UVC) rationally designed to mimic the natural physiologic immunity induced post viral infection of host cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells were CRISPR engineered to delete MHC-I expression and simultaneously overexpress a NK Ligand adjuvant to increase rapid cellular apoptosis which was hypothesized to enhance viral antigen presentation in the resulting immune microenvironment leading to a protective immune response. Cells were further engineered to express the parental variant WA1/2020 SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a representative viral antigen prior to irradiation and cryopreservation. The cellular vaccine was then used to immunize non-human primates in a standard 2-dose, IM injected prime + boost vaccination with 1e8 cells per 1 ml dose resulting in robust neutralizing antibody responses (1e3 nAb titers) with decreasing levels at 6 months duration. Similar titers generated in this established NHP model have translated into protective human neutralizing antibody levels in SARS-Cov-2 vaccinated individuals. Animals vaccinated with WA1/2020 spike antigens were subsequently challenged with 1.0 x 105 TCID50 infectious Delta (B.1.617.2) SARS-CoV-2 in a heterologous challenge which resulted in an approximately 3-log order decrease in viral RNA load in the lungs. These heterologous viral challenge results reflect the ongoing real-world experience of original variant WA1/2020 spike antigen vaccinated populations exposed to rapidly emerging variants like Delta and now Omicron. This cellular vaccine is designed to be a rapidly scalable cell line with a modular poly-antigenic payload to allow for practical, large-scale clinical manufacturing and use in an evolving viral variant environment. Human clinical translation of the UVC is being actively explored for this and potential future pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Knowledge of human fetal blood development and how it differs from adult is highly relevant for our understanding of congenital blood and immune disorders as well as childhood leukemia, the latter known to originate in utero. Blood production during development occurs in waves that overlap in time and space adding to heterogeneity, which necessitates single cell approaches. Here, a combined single cell immunophenotypic and transcriptional map of first trimester primitive blood development is presented. Using CITE-seq (Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing) the molecular profile of established immunophenotypic gated progenitors was analyzed in the fetal liver (FL). Classical markers for hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) such as CD90 and CD49F were largely preserved, whereas CD135 (FLT3) and CD123 (IL3R) had a ubiquitous expression pattern capturing heterogenous populations. Direct molecular comparison with an adult bone marrow (BM) data set revealed that HSC-like cells were less frequent in FL, whereas cells with a lympho-myeloid signature were more abundant. Furthermore, an erythro-myeloid primed multipotent progenitor cluster was identified, potentially representing a transient, FL-specific progenitor. Based on the projection performed, up- and downregulated genes between fetal and adult cells were analyzed. In general, cell cycle pathways, including MYC targets were shown to be upregulated in fetal cells, whereas gene sets involved in inflammation and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex were downregulated. Importantly, a fetal core molecular signature was identified that could discriminate certain types of infant and childhood leukemia from adult counterparts.\n\nOur detailed single cell map presented herein emphasizes molecular as well as immunophenotypic differences between fetal and adult primitive blood cells, of significance for future studies of pediatric leukemia and blood development in general.",

The mechanisms that shape these structures remain poorly understood. Here, we show how the actin cytoskeleton and a provisional matrix work together to sculpt acellular longitudinal alae ridges in the cuticle of adult C. elegans. Transient actomyosin-dependent constriction of the underlying lateral epidermis accompanies deposition of the provisional matrix at the earliest stages of alae formation. Actin is required to pattern the provisional matrix into longitudinal bands that are initially offset from the pattern of longitudinal actin filaments. These bands appear ultrastructurally as alternating regions of adhesion and separation within laminated provisional matrix layers. The provisional matrix is required to establish these demarcated zones of adhesion and separation, which ultimately give rise to alae ridges and their intervening valleys, respectively. Provisional matrix proteins shape the alae ridges and valleys but are not present within the final structure. We propose a morphogenetic mechanism wherein cortical actin patterns are relayed mechanically to the laminated provisional matrix to set up distinct zones of matrix layer separation and accretion that shape a permanent and acellular matrix structure.",

Although the major phenotypic consequences and the underlying transcriptional changes from Ret LoF in the developing ENS have been described, its cell type and state-specific effects are unknown. Consequently, we performed single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on an enriched population of ENCDCs isolated from the developing GI tract of Ret null heterozygous and homozygous mouse embryos at embryonic day (E)12.5 and E14.5. We demonstrate four significant findings: (1) Ret-expressing ENCDCs are a heterogeneous population composed of ENS progenitors as well as glial and neuronal committed cells; (2) neurons committed to a predominantly inhibitory motor neuron developmental trajectory are not produced under Ret LoF, leaving behind a mostly excitatory motor neuron developmental program; (3) HSCR-associated and Ret gene regulatory network genes exhibit distinct expression patterns across Ret-expressing ENCDC with their expression impacted by Ret LoF; and (4) Ret deficiency leads to precocious differentiation and reduction in the number of proliferating ENS precursors. Our results support a model in which Ret contributes to multiple distinct cellular phenotypes associated with the proper development of the ENS, including the specification of inhibitory neuron subtypes, cell cycle dynamics of ENS progenitors, and the developmental timing of neuronal and glial commitment.\n\nSummary StatementRet LoF affects proper development of the mouse ENS through multiple distinct cellular phenotypes including restriction of neuronal fate potential, disruption of ENCDC migration, and modulation of progenitor proliferation rate.",

    "abstract": "Each heartbeat is triggered by the sinoatrial node, the natural pacemaker of the heart. Animal models have revealed that pacemaker cells share a common progenitor with the (pro)epicardium, and that the pacemaker cardiomyocytes further diversify into \"transitional\", \"tail\" and \"head\" subtypes. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we studied the differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells into pacemaker cardiomyocytes. Single cell RNA sequencing identified the presence of myocardial populations resembling subtypes present in the formed sinoatrial node, and in addition revealed a side population of (pro)epicardial cells. Time-course trajectory analysis uncovered a role for WNT signaling in determining myocardial versus proepicardial cell fate. We experimentally demonstrate that presence of WNT signaling prior to the branching point of a common progenitor enhances proepicardial cell differentiation at the expense of myocardial pacemaker cells. Furthermore, we uncover a role for TGF{beta} and WNT signaling in differentiation towards transitional and head pacemaker subtypes, respectively. Our findings provide new biological insights into human pacemaker differentiation, open avenues for complex disease modeling and inform regenerative approaches.",

Expansion of its product scope through metabolic engineering necessitates reliable and efficient genetic tools, particularly for genome edits to the primary metabolism that affect cell growth. Here, we have designed a genome editing toolbox by utilizing Cas12a from Lachnospiraceae bacterium ND2006 (LbCas12a) in combination with the homology-directed repair machinery endogenously present in M. maripaludis. Remarkably, this toolbox can knock out target genes with a success rate of up to 95%, despite the hyper-polyploidy of M. maripaludis. For the purposes of demonstrating a large-sized deletion, we have replaced the flagellum operon (ca. 8.9 kbp) by the {beta}-glucuronidase gene. To facilitate metabolic engineering and flux balancing in M. maripaludis, the relative strength of 15 different promoters were quantified in the presence of the two common growth substrates, formate or carbon dioxide and hydrogen. This CRISPR/LbCas12a toolbox can be regarded as a reliable and fast method for genome editing in a methanogen.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 origin debate has greatly been influenced by Genome comparison studies of late, revealing the seemingly sudden emergence of the Furin-Like Cleavage Site at the S1/S2 junction of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike (FLCSSpike) containing its 681PRRAR685 motif, absent in other related respiratory viruses. Being the rate-limiting (i.e., the slowest) step, the host Furin cleavage is instrumental in the abrupt increase in transmissibility in COVID-19, compared to earlier onsets of respiratory viral diseases. In such a context, the current paper entraps a disorder-to-order transition of the FLCSSpike (concomitant to an entropy arrest) upon binding to Furin. The interaction clearly seems to be optimized for a more efficient proteolytic cleavage in SARS-CoV-2. The study further shows the formation of dynamically interchangeable and persistent networks of salt-bridges at the Spike-Furin interface in SARS-CoV-2 involving the three arginines (R682, R683, R685) of the FLCSSpike with several anionic residues (E230, E236, D259, D264, D306) coming from Furin, strategically distributed around its catalytic triad. Multiplicity and structural degeneracy of plausible salt-bridge network archetypes seems the other key characteristic features of the Spike-Furin binding in SARS-CoV-2 allowing the system to breathe - a trademark of protein disorder transitions. Interestingly, with respect to the homologous interaction in SARS-CoV (2002/2003) taken as a baseline, the Spike-Furin binding events generally in the coronavirus lineage seems to have a preference for ionic bond formation, even with lesser number of cationic residues at their potentially polybasic FLCSSpike patches. The interaction energies are suggestive of a characteristic metastabilities attributed to Spike-Furin interactions generally to the coronavirus lineage - which appears to be favorable for proteolytic cleavages targeted at flexible protein loops. T he current findings not only offer novel mechanistic insights into the coronavirus molecular pathology and evolution but also add substantially to the existing theories of proteolytic cleavages.",

    "abstract": "Synaptic vesicles are primed into a state that is ready for fast neurotransmitter release upon Ca2+-binding to synaptotagmin-1. This state likely includes trans-SNARE complexes between the vesicle and plasma membranes that are bound to synaptotagmin-1 and complexins. However, the nature of this state and the steps leading to membrane fusion are unclear, in part because of the difficulty of studying this dynamic process experimentally. To shed light into these questions, we performed all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of systems containing trans-SNARE complexes between two flat bilayers or a vesicle and a flat bilayer with or without fragments of synaptotagmin-1 and/or complexin-1. Our results help visualize potential states of the release machinery en route to fusion, and suggest mechanistic features that may control the speed of release. In particular, the simulations suggest that the primed state contains almost fully assembled trans-SNARE complexes bound to the synaptotagmin-1 C2B domain and complexin-1 in a spring-loaded configuration where interactions of the C2B domain with the plasma membrane orient complexin-1 toward the vesicle, avoiding premature membrane merger but keeping the system ready for fast fusion upon Ca2+ influx.",

To uncover the mechanism behind the anti-tumour effects we have performed a transcriptional analysis of AM630 activity both in the tumour core cells (U87) and the invasive margin cells (GIN-8), the latter representing a better proxy of post-surgical residual disease.\n\nResultsThe core and invasive margin cells exhibited markedly different gene expression profiles and only the core cells had high expression of a potential AM630 target, the CB1 receptor. Both cell types had moderate expression of the HTR2B serotonin receptor, a reported AM630 target. We found that the AM630 driven transcriptional response was substantially higher in the central cells than in the invasive margin cells, with the former driving the up regulation of immune response and the down regulation of cell cycle and metastatic pathways and correlating with transcriptional responses driven by established anti-neoplastics as well as serotonin receptor antagonists.\n\nConclusionOur results highlight the different responsiveness of the core and invasive margin cells. Taken together, whilst our findings identify AM630 as an anti-neoplastic drug, showing a high correlation with known anti-proliferative drugs, we find distinct drug sensitivies of the infiltrative margin relative to contrast-enhanced core regions of GBM upon which failed molecular targeted therapies to date have been predicated.",

    "abstract": "MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in a wide variety of physiological processes, including those related to the reproductive system. Although in the last decade a plethora of miRNAs has been reported, the miRNA alterations occurred by environmental cues and their biological functions have not yet been elucidated. With the aim to identify epigenetic regulations mediated by miRNAs in the gonads in a climate change scenario, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were subjected to high temperatures during sex differentiation (18-32 days post fertilization, dpf), a treatment that results in male-skewed sex ratios. Once the fish reached adulthood (90 dpf), ovaries and testes were sequenced by high-throughput technologies. About 101 million high-quality reads were obtained from gonadal samples. Analyses of the expression levels of the miRNAs identified a total of 23 and 1 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in ovaries and testes, respectively, two months after the heat treatment. Most of the identified miRNAs were involved in human sex-related cancer. After retrieving 3 UTR regions, ~400 predicted targets of the 24 DE miRNAs were obtained, some with reproduction-related functions. Their synteny in the zebrafish genome was, for more than half of them, in the chromosomes 7, 2, 4, 3 and 11 in the ovaries, chromosome 4 being the place where the predicted sex-associated-region (sar) is localized in wild zebrafish. Further, spatial localization in the gonads of two selected miRNAs (miR-122-5p and miR-146-5p) showed exclusive expression in the ovarian germ cells. The present study expands the catalog of sex-specific miRNAs and deciphers, for the first time, thermosensitive miRNAs in the zebrafish gonads that might be used as potential epimarkers to predict environmental past events.",

    "abstract": "Recently we reported that in human coronary artery endothelial cells, activation of the P2Y2 receptor (P2Y2R) induces up-regulation of tissue factor (TF), a vital initiator of the coagulation cascade. However, others have shown that monocyte TF is more critical than endothelial TF in provoking a pro-thrombotic state. Thus, we aimed to study whether monocytes express the P2Y2R, its role in controlling TF expression, and its relevance in vivo. RT-PCR and receptor activity assays revealed that among the eight P2Y nucleotide receptors, the P2Y2 subtype was selectively and functionally expressed in human monocytic THP-1 cells and primary monocytes. Stimulation of the cells by ATP or UTP dramatically increased TF protein expression, which was abolished by AR-C118925, a selective P2Y2R antagonist, or by siRNA silencing the P2Y2R. In addition, UTP or ATP treatment induced a rapid accumulation of TF mRNA preceded with an increased TF pre-mRNA, indicating enhanced TF gene transcription. In addition, stimulation of the monocyte P2Y2R significantly activated ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and Akt, along with their downstream transcription factors including c-Jun, c-Fos, and ATF-2, whereas blocking these pathways respectively, all significantly suppressed P2Y2R-mediated TF expression. Furthermore, we found that LPS triggered ATP release and TF expression, the latter of which was suppressed by apyrase or P2Y2R blockage. Importantly, P2Y2R-null mice were more resistant than wild-type mice in response to a lethal dose of LPS, accompanied by much less TF expression in bone marrow cells. These findings demonstrate for the first time that the P2Y2R mediates TF expression in human monocytes through mechanisms involving ERK1/2, JNK, p38, and AKT, and that P2Y2R deletion protects the mice from endotoxemia-induced TF expression and death, highlighting monocyte P2Y2R may be a new drug target for the prevention and/or treatment of relevant thrombotic disease.",

AtERF60 is induced in response to drought, salt, abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and bacterial pathogen PstDC3000 infection. AtERF60 interacts with DEHYDRATION RESPONSE ELEMENTS (DRE1/2) and GCC box indicating its ability to regulate multiple responses. Overexpression of AtERF60 results in the drought and salt stress tolerant phenotype in both seedling and mature Arabidopsis plants in comparison with the wild type (WT-Col). However, mutation in AtERF60 showed hyperactive response against drought and salt stress in comparison with its overexpression and WT. Microarray and qRT-PCR analysis of overexpression and mutant lines indicated that AtERF60 regulates both abiotic and biotic stress inducible genes. One of the differentially expressing transcripts was ABR1 and we found that AtERF60 interacts with the DRE cis-elements present in the ABR1 promoter. The mutation in AtERF60 showed ABA hypersensitive response, increased ABA content, and reduced susceptibility to PstDC3000.

    "abstract": "Upon ligand engagement, certain receptors can activate an integrin through a mechanism called inside-out signalling. This phenomenon prepares the cell for the next steps of the process it will perform. CR3 (Complement receptor 3), the most abundant {beta}2 integrin in monocytes and macrophages, and CD13 (aminopeptidase N) are two immune receptors with overlapping activities: adhesion, phagocytosis of opsonized particles, and respiratory burst induction. They can be found together in functional signalling microdomains, or lipid rafts, on the surface of human leukocytes. Thus, given their common functions, shared physical location and the fact that some phagocytic and adhesion receptors activate a selection of integrins, we hypothesized that CD13 could activate CR3 through an inside-out signalling mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we first ascertained the activation of CR3 after CD13 crosslinking in human monocyte-derived macrophages. We used an integrated analysis of bioinformatics and experimental data to suggest two possible signalling cascades that could explain the phenomenon. Finally, we show that the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk is a key attenuator of this pathway. Our results demonstrated that, even in the absence of canonical signalling motifs, and despite having a noticeably short cytoplasmic tail (7-10 amino acids), CD13 was capable of triggering an inside-out signalling cascade, adding a new function to those already known for this moonlighting protein.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryStimulation of CD13 activated the integrin CR3 via an inside-out signalling pathway, a mechanistic model is proposed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundShrimp have the ability to accommodate viruses in long term, persistent infections without signs of disease. Endogenous viral elements (EVE) play a role in this process probably via production of negative-sense Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-like fragments. These bind with Piwi proteins to dampen viral replication via the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. We searched a draft genome of the giant tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon)(GenBank record JABERT000000000) for the presence of EVE related to a shrimp parvovirus originally named infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHHNV).\n\nResultsThe shrimp draft genome contained 3 piRNA-like gene clusters containing scrambled IHHNV EVE. Two clusters were located distant from one another in linkage group 35 (LG35). Both LG35 clusters contained multiple DNA fragments with high homology (99%) to GenBank records DQ228358 and EU675312 that were both called \" non-infectious IHHNV Type A\" (IHHNV-A) when originally discovered. However, our results and those from a recent Australian P. monodon genome assembly indicate that the relevant GenBank records for IHHNV-A are sequence-assembly artifacts derived from scrambled and fragmental IHHNV-EVE. Although the EVE in the two LG35 clusters showed high homology only to IHHNV-A, the clusters were separate and distinct with respect to the arrangement (i.e., order and reading direction) and proportional content of the IHHNV-A GenBank records. We conjecture that these 2 clusters may constitute independent allele-like clusters on a pair of homologous chromosomes. The third EVE cluster was found in linkage group 7 (LG7). It contained EVE with high homology (99%) only to GenBank record AF218266 with the potential to protect shrimp against infectious IHHNV.\n\nConclusionsOur results suggested the possibility of viral-type specificity in EVE clusters. Specificity is important because whole EVE clusters for one viral type would be transmitted to offspring as collective hereditary units. This would be advantageous if one or more of the EVE within the cluster were protective against disease caused by the cognate virus. It would also facilitate gene editing for removal of non-protective EVE clusters or for transfer of protective EVE clusters to genetically improve existing shrimp breeding stocks that might lack them.",

Chum salmon is the second largest of the Pacific salmon, behind Chinook salmon, and considered the most plentiful Pacific salmon by overall biomass. This species is of significant commercial and economic importance: on average the commercial chum salmon fishery has the second highest processed value of the Pacific salmon within British Columbia. The aim of this work was to establish genomic baseline resources for this species. Our first step to accomplish this goal was to generate a chum salmon reference genome assembly from a doubled-haploid chum salmon. Gene annotation of this genome was facilitated by an extensive RNA-seq database we were able to create from multiple tissues. Range-wide resequencing of chum salmon genomes allowed us to categorize genome-wide geographic variation, which in turn reinforced the idea that genetic differentiation was best described on a regional, rather than at a stock-specific, level. Within British Columbia, chum salmon regional groupings were described at the conservation unit (CU) level, and there may be substructure within particular CUs. Genome wide associations of phenotypic sex to SNP genetic markers identified two clear peaks, a very strong peak on Linkage Group 15, and another on Linkage Group 3. With these new resources, we were better able to characterize the sex-determining region and gain further insights into sex determination in chum salmon and the general biology of this species.",

    "abstract": "The development of vascular networks on-chip is crucial for the long-term culture of three-dimensional cell aggregates such as organoids, spheroids, tumoroids, and tissue explants. Despite the rapid advancement of microvascular network systems and organoid technology, vascularizing organoids-on-chips remains a challenge in tissue engineering. Moreover, most existing microfluidic devices poorly reflect the complexity of in vivo flows and require complex technical settings to operate. Considering these constraints, we developed an innovative platform to establish and monitor the formation of endothelial networks around model spheroids of mesenchymal and endothelial cells as well as blood vessel organoids generated from pluripotent stem cells, cultured for up to 15 days on-chip. Importantly, these networks were functional, demonstrating intravascular perfusion within the spheroids or vascular organoids connected to neighbouring endothelial beds. This microphysiological system thus represents a viable organ-on-chip model to vascularize biological tissues and should allow to establish perfusion into organoids using advanced microfluidics.",

    "abstract": "The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of diverse mRNAs contains secondary structures that can influence protein synthesis by modulating the initiation step of translation. Studies support the ability of these structures to inhibit 40S subunit recruitment and scanning, but the dynamics of ribosomal subunit interactions with mRNA remain poorly understood. Here, we developed a reconstituted Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell-free translation system with fluorescently labeled ribosomal subunits. We applied this extract and single-molecule fluorescence microscopy to monitor, in real time, individual 40S and 60S interactions with mRNAs containing 5 UTR hairpin structures with varying thermostability. In comparison to mRNAs containing no or weak 5'UTR hairpins ({Delta}G >= -5.4 kcal/mol), mRNAs with stable hairpins ({Delta}G <= -16.5 kcal/mol) showed reduced numbers of 60S recruitment to mRNA, consistent with the expectation of reduced translation efficiency for such mRNAs. Interestingly, such mRNAs showed increased numbers of 40S recruitment events to individual mRNAs but with shortened duration on mRNA. Correlation analysis showed that these unstable 40S binding events were nonproductive for 60S recruitment. Furthermore, although the mRNA sequence is long enough to accommodate multiple 40S, individual mRNAs are predominantly observed to engage with a single 40S at a time, indicating the sequestering of mRNA 5 end by initiating 40S. Altogether, these observations suggest that stable cap-distal hairpins in 5 UTR reduce initiation and translation efficiency by destabilizing 40S-mRNA interactions and promoting 40S dissociation from mRNA. The premature 40S dissociation frees mRNA 5'-end accessibility for new initiation events, but the increased rate of 40S recruitment is insufficient to compensate for the reduction of initiation efficiency due to premature 40S dissociation. This study provides the first single-molecule kinetic characterization of 40S/60S interactions with mRNA during cap-dependent initiation and the modulation of such interactions by cap-distal 5 UTR hairpin structures.",

    "abstract": "The Zika virus (ZIKV) caused neurological abnormalities in more than 3500 Brazilian newborns between 2015 and 2020. Data have pointed to oxidative stress in astrocytes as well as to dysregulations in neural cell proliferation and cell cycle as important events accounting for the cell death and neurological complications observed in Congenital Zika Syndrome. Copper imbalance has been shown to induce similar alterations in other pathologies, and disturbances in copper homeostasis have already been described in viral infections. For this reason, we investigated copper homeostasis imbalance as a factor that could contribute to the cytotoxic effects of ZIKV infection in iPSC-derived human astrocytes. Our results show that ZIKV infection leads to a downregulation of one of the transporters mediating copper release, ATP7B protein. We also observed the activation of mechanisms that counteract high copper levels, including the synthesis of copper chaperones and the reduction of the copper importer protein CTR1. Finally, we show that chelator-mediated copper sequestration in ZIKV-infected astrocytes reduces the levels of reactive oxygen species and improves cell viability, but does not change the overall percentage of infected cells. In summary, our results show that copper homeostasis imbalance plays a role in the pathology of ZIKV in astrocytes, indicating that it may also be a factor accounting for the developmental abnormalities in the central nervous system following viral infection. Evaluating micronutrient levels and the use of copper chelators in pregnant women susceptible to ZIKV infection may be promising strategies to manage novel cases of congenital ZIKV syndrome.",

    "abstract": "N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) comprise a family of ligand-gated ionotropic glutamate receptors that mediate a calcium-permeable component to fast excitatory neurotransmission. NMDARs are heterotetrameric assemblies of two obligate GluN1 subunits (encoded by the GRIN1 gene) and two GluN2 subunits (encoded by the GRIN2A-GRIN2D genes). Sequencing data shows that 43% (297/679) of all currently known NMDAR disease-associated genetic variants are within the GRIN2A gene, which encodes the GluN2A subunit. Here, we show that unlike missense GRIN2A variants, individuals affected with disease-associated null GRIN2A variants demonstrate a transient period of seizure susceptibility that begins during infancy and diminishes near adolescence. To explore this new clinical finding at that circuit and cellular level, we conducted studies using Grin2a+/- and Grin2a-/-mice at various stages during neurodevelopment. We show increased circuit excitability and CA1 pyramidal cell output in juvenile mice of both Grin2a+/- and Grin2a-/- mice. These alterations in somatic spiking are not due to global upregulation other GRIN genes (including Grin2b) nor can they be attributed to perturbations in the intrinsic excitability or action-potential firing properties of CA1 pyramidal cells. Deeper evaluation of the developing CA1 circuit led us to uncover age- and Grin2a gene dosing-dependent transient delays in the electrophysiological maturation programs of PV interneurons. Overall, we report that Grin2a+/+ mice reach electrophysiological maturation between the neonatal and juvenile neurodevelopmental timepoints, with Grin2a+/- mice not reaching electrophysiological maturation until preadolescence, and Grin2a-/- not reaching electrophysiological maturation until adulthood. Overall, these data may represent a molecular mechanism describing the transient nature of seizure burden in disease-associated null GRIN2A patients.",

    "abstract": "Blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction is well-known in Alzheimers disease (AD), but the precise molecular changes contributing to its pathophysiology are unclear. To understand the transcriptional changes in brain vascular cells, we performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNAseq) of temporal cortex tissue in 24 AD and control brains resulting in 79,751 nuclei, 4,604 of which formed three distinct vascular clusters characterized as activated pericytes, endothelia and resting pericytes. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and their enriched pathways in these clusters and detected the most transcriptional changes within activated pericytes. Using our data and a knowledge-based predictive algorithm, we discovered and prioritized molecular interactions between vascular and astrocyte clusters, the main cell types of the gliovascular unit (GVU) of the BBB. Vascular targets predicted to interact with astrocytic ligands have biological functions in signalling, angiogenesis, amyloid {beta} metabolism and cytoskeletal structure. Top astrocytic and vascular interacting molecules include both novel and known AD risk genes such as APOE, APP and ECE1. Our findings provide information on transcriptional changes in predicted vascular-astrocytic partners at the GVU, bringing insights to the molecular mechanisms of BBB breakdown in AD.\n\nGraphical AbstractPericytes (yellow), endothelia (salmon) and astrocytes (purple) that form the gliovascular unit (GVU) at the blood brain barrier (BBB) were interrogated for their differentially expressed genes (DEG) and vascular cell (pericyte or endothelia) to astrocyte interactions using single nucleus RNA sequencing (RNAseq) transcriptome obtained from brains of Alzheimers disease (AD) patients and controls. We identified many upregulated (red) or downregulated (blue) DEGs in AD brains in these cell types. These genes have known biological functions in amyloid {beta} (A{beta}) clearance, immune modulation, astrogliosis and neuronal death. Novel predicted interactions were identified between vascular cells and astrocytic DEGs. Collectively, our findings highlight the vast transcriptome changes that occur at the GVU and provide mechanistic insights into BBB dysfunction in AD.

    "abstract": "The Drosophila brain has only a fraction of the number of neurons of higher organisms such as mice and humans. Yet the sheer complexity of its neural circuits recently revealed by large connectomics datasets suggests that computationally modeling the function of fruit fly brain circuits at this scale posits significant challenges.\n\nTo address these challenges, we present here a programmable ontology that expands the scope of the current Drosophila brain anatomy ontologies to encompass the functional logic of the fly brain. The programmable ontology provides a language not only for modeling circuit motifs but also for programmatically exploring their functional logic. To achieve this goal, we tightly integrated the programmable ontology with the workflow of the interactive FlyBrainLab computing platform. As part of the programmable ontology, we developed NeuroNLP++, a web application that supports free-form English queries for constructing functional brain circuits fully anchored on the available connectome/synaptome datasets, and the published worldwide literature.\n\nIn addition, we present a methodology for including a model of the space of odorants into the programmable ontology, and for modeling olfactory sensory circuits of the antenna of the fruit fly brain that detect odorant sources. Furthermore, we describe a methodology for modeling the functional logic of the antennal lobe circuit consisting of massive local feedback loops, a characteristic feature observed across Drosophila brain regions. Finally, using a circuit library, we demonstrate the power of our methodology for interactively exploring the functional logic of the massive number of feedback loops in the antennal lobe.",

With a fluorescent virus we demonstrate that ABCs are infected with {gamma}HV68 at similar rates to other previously activated B cells. We find that mice without ABCs display defects in anti-viral IgG2a/c antibodies and are more susceptible to {gamma}HV68 reactivation when challenged with heterologous infection.

    "abstract": "Piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are an animal-specific class of germline-enriched small non-coding RNAs that shape transcriptome, as well as ensure genomic integrity and fertility by regulating transposons and other selfish genetic elements. In Caenorhabditis elegans mature piRNAs are 21-nucleotides long, begin with a monophosphorylated uridine, and they associate with PRG-1 to form piRISCs that scan the transcriptome for  non-self sequences. However, these piRNAs are born as longer 5-capped transcripts, where PARN-1, a 3-5 exoribonuclease, contributes to the formation of the mature 3-end. But, till date, the 5-processing events remain elusive. We demonstrate that the recently identified endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2 is involved in the processing of the 5-end of precursor piRNAs in worms. Depletion of XRN-2 results in reduced mature piRNA levels, with concomitant increase in levels of the 5-capped precursors. We also reveal that the piRNAs born as longer precursor molecules ([&ge;]60 nt), prior to 5-end processing, undergo ENDU-1-mediated endoribonucleolytic processing of their 3-ends. Our in vitro RNA-protein interaction studies unravel the mechanistic interactions between XRN-2 and PRG-1 towards the formation of mature 5-ends of piRNAs. In vivo experiments employing prg-1 mutant worms indicate that XRN-2 has the potential to perform clearance of precursors that are not bound and protected by PRG-1. Finally, we also demonstrate that XRN-2 is not only important for the generation of mature piRNAs and piRNA-dependent endo-siRNAs, but through yet unknown pathways, it also affects piRNA-independent endo-siRNAs that shape transcriptome, as well as contribute to genomic integrity via regulation of transposable elements.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe degradation of sucrose plays an important role in the process of crop biomass allocation and yield formation. Invertase (INV) irreversibly catalyzes the conversion of sucrose into glucose and fructose, which doomed its important role in plant development and stress tolerance. However, the functions of INV genes in wheat, one of the most important crops, were less studied due to the polyploidy.\n\nResultsHere, we systematically analyzed the INV gene family based on the latest published wheat reference genomic information. A total of 126 TaINV genes were identified and classified into three classes based on the phylogenetic relationship and their gene structure. Of which, 11 and 83 gene pairs were identified as tandem and segmental duplication genes respectively, while the Ka/Ks ratios of tandem and segmental duplication TaINV genes were less than 1. Expression profile analysis shows that 18 TaINV genes have tissue-specific expression, and 54 TaINV genes were involved in stress response. Furthermore, RNA-seq showed that 35 genes are differentially expressed in grain weight NILs N0910-81L/N0910-81S, in which 9 TaINVs were stably detected by qRT-PCR at three time-points, 4, 7 and 10 DPA. Four of them (TaCWI47, TaCWI48, TaCWI50 and TaVI27) different expressed between the NILs resided in 4 QTL segments (QTGW.nwafu-5DL.1, QTGW.nwafu-5DL.2, QTGW.nwafu-7AS.1 and QTGW.nwafu-7AS.2). These findings facilitate function investigations of the wheat INV gene family and provide new insights into the grain development mechanism in wheat.\n\nConclusionsOur results showed that allopolyploid events were the main reason for the expansion of the TaINV gene family in hexaploid wheat, and duplication genes might undergo purifying selection. The expression profiling of TaINV genes implied that they are likely to play an important role in wheat growth and development and adaption to stressful environments. And TaCWI47, TaCWI48, TaCWI50 and TaVI27 may have more important roles in grain developments. Our study lay a base for further dissecting the functional characterization of TaINV family members.",

    "abstract": "Caloric restriction (CR) prevents obesity, promotes healthy aging, and increases resilience against several pathological stimuli in laboratory rodents. At the mitochondrial level, protection promoted by CR in the brain and liver is related to higher calcium uptake rates and capacities, avoiding Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. Dietary restriction has also been shown to increase kidney resistance against damaging stimuli such as ischemia/reperfusion, but if these effects are related to similar mitochondrial adaptations had not yet been uncovered. Here, we characterized changes in mitochondrial function in response to six months of CR in rats, measuring bioenergetic parameters, redox balance and calcium homeostasis. CR promoted an increase in mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates under non-phosphorylating and uncoupled conditions. While CR prevents mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production in many tissues, in kidney we found that mitochondrial H2O2 release was enhanced, although levels of carbonylated proteins and methionine sulfoxide were unchanged. Surprisingly, and opposite to the effects observed in brain and liver, mitochondria from CR animals are more prone to Ca2+-induced mitochondrial permeability transition. CR mitochondria also displayed higher calcium uptake rates, which were not accompanied by changes in calcium efflux rates, nor related to altered inner mitochondrial membrane potentials or the amounts of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (MCU). Instead, increased mitochondrial calcium uptake rates in CR kidneys correlate with a loss of MICU2, an MCU modulator. Interestingly, MICU2 is also modulated by CR in liver, suggesting it has a broader diet-sensitive regulatory role controlling mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. Together, our results highlight the organ-specific bioenergetic, redox, and ionic transport effects of CR. Specifically, we describe the regulation of the expression of MICU2 and its effects on mitochondrial calcium transport as a novel and interesting aspect of the metabolic responses to dietary interventions.",

    "abstract": "Histone post-translational modifications are small chemical changes to histone protein structure that have cascading effects on diverse cellular functions. Detecting histone modifications and characterizing their binding partners are critical steps in understanding chromatin biochemistry and have been accessed using common reagents such as antibodies, recombinant assays, and FRET based systems. High throughput platforms could accelerate work in this field, and also could be used to engineer de novo histone affinity reagents; yet published studies on their use with histones have been noticeably sparse. Here we describe specific experimental conditions that affect binding specificities of post-translationally modified histones in classic protein engineering platforms and likely explain the relative difficulty with histone targets in these platforms. We also show that manipulating avidity of binding interactions may improve specificity of binding.",

    "abstract": "Noninvasive imaging is a powerful tool for understanding the in vivo behavior of drug delivery systems and successfully translating promising platforms into the clinic. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), nano-sized vesicles with a lipid bilayer produced by nearly all cell types, are emerging platforms for drug delivery. To date, the biodistribution of EVs has been insufficiently investigated, particularly using nuclear imaging-based modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET). Herein, we developed positron-emitting radiotracers to investigate the biodistribution of EVs isolated from various human cell sources using PET imaging. Chelator conjugation did not impact EVs size and subsequent radiolabeling was found to be highly efficient and stable with Zr-89 (t1/2 = 78.4 h). In vivo tracking of EVs isolated from bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSCs EVs), primary human macrophages (M{phi} EVs), and a melanoma cell line (A375 EVs) were performed in immunocompetent ICR mice. Imaging studies revealed excellent in vivo circulation for all EVs, with a half-life of approximately 12 h. Significantly higher liver uptake was observed for M{phi} EVs, evidencing the tissue tropism of EV and highlighting the importance of carefully choosing EVs cell sources for drug delivery applications. Conversely, the liver, spleen, and lung uptake of the BMSC EVs and A375 EVs was relatively low. We also investigated the impact of immunodeficiency on the biodistribution of BMSC EVs using NSG mice. The spleen uptake drastically increased in NSG mice, which could confound results of therapeutic studies employing this mouse models. Lastly, PET imaging studies in a melanoma tumor model demonstrated efficient tumor uptake of BMSC EVs following intravenous injection. Overall, these imaging studies evidenced the potential of EVs as carriers to treat a variety of diseases, such as cancer or in regenerative medicine applications, and the necessity to understand EVs tropism to optimize their therapeutic deployment.",

    "abstract": "Pompe disease is a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency resulting in lysosomal glycogen accumulation and progressive myopathy. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is the current standard of care, which prolongs the quality of life for Pompe patients. However, ERT has limitations due to lack of enzyme penetration into the central nervous system (CNS) and skeletal muscles, immunogenicity against the recombinant enzyme, and requires life-long biweekly infusions. In a preclinical mouse model, a clinically relevant promoter to drive lentiviral vector-mediated expression of engineered GAA in autologous hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) was tested with nine unique human chimeric GAA coding sequences incorporating distinct peptide tags and codon-optimization iterations. Vectors including glycosylation independent lysosomal targeting (GILT) tags resulted in effective GAA enzyme delivery into key disease tissues with enhanced reduction of glycogen, myofiber and CNS vacuolation, compared to non-tagged GAA in Gaa knockout mice, a model of Pompe disease. Genetically modified microglial cells in brains were detected at low levels, but provided robust correction. Furthermore, an aminoacid substitution in the tag added to reduced capacity to induce insulin signaling and there was no evidence of off-target effects. This study demonstrated the therapeutic potential of lentiviral HSPC gene therapy exploiting optimized GAA tagged coding sequences to reverse Pompe disease pathology in a preclinical mouse model providing a promising vector candidate for further investigation.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryA candidate vector for hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy of Pompe disease.",

    "abstract": "Translation in eukaryotic cells occurs predominantly through a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap-dependent mechanism. m7G cap interactions with eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) facilitates 43S recruitment to the mRNA 5 end and enhances the translation efficiency of mRNA. However, it remains poorly understood how m7G cap-eIF4E interactions affect polysome formation kinetics. Here, we examine the role of the m7G cap in polysome formation by utilizing a single-molecule approach to track individual ribosomes during active translation. Translation was monitored in wheat germ extract with capped and uncapped synthetic mRNAs and in HeLa extract with purified human eIF4E titration. The presence of the m7G cap and the supplementation of eIF4E to eIF4E-deficient extract enhanced the kinetics of the first initiation event of polysomes. Subsequent to the first initiation event, efficient polysome-forming initiation events occurred independent of mRNA m7G capping status and eIF4E concentration. Our results indicate that m7G cap-eIF4E interactions in wheat germ and HeLa extracts promote polysome formation by enhancing first-round initiation kinetics. The dynamics of individual translation events on polysomal mRNAs suggest that first-round initiation events activate mRNAs for efficient subsequent rounds of polysome-forming initiation.",

    "abstract": "In Escherichia coli, translocation of RNA polymerase (RNAP) during transcription introduces supercoiling to DNA, which influences the initiation and elongation behaviors of RNAP. To quantify the role of supercoiling in transcription regulation, we develop a spatially resolved supercoiling model of transcription, describing RNAP-supercoiling interactions, topoisomerase activities, stochastic topological domain formation, and supercoiling diffusion in all transcription stages. This model establishes that transcription-induced supercoiling mediates the cooperation of co-transcribing RNAP molecules in highly expressed genes. It reveals that supercoiling transmits RNAP-accessible information through DNA and enables different RNAP molecules to communicate within and between genes. It thus predicts that a topological domain could serve as a transcription regulator, generating substantial transcription bursting and coordinating communications between adjacent genes in the domain. The model provides a quantitative platform for further theoretical and experimental investigations of how genome organization impacts transcription.\n\nAuthor SummaryDNA mechanics and transcription dynamics are intimately coupled. During transcription, the translocation of RNA polymerase overwinds the DNA ahead and underwinds the DNA behind, rendering the DNA supercoiled. The supercoiled DNA could, in return, influences the behavior of the RNA polymerase, and consequently the amount of mRNA product it makes. Furthermore, supercoils could propagate on the DNA over thousands of base pairs, impacting RNA polymerase molecules at faraway sites. These complicated interplays between supercoiling and RNA polymerase makes supercoiling an important transcription regulator. To quantitatively investigate the role of supercoiling in transcription, we build a spatially resolved model that links transcription with the generation, propagation, and dissipation of supercoiling. Our model reveals that supercoiling mediates transcription at multiple length scales. At a single-gene scale, we show that supercoiling gives rise to the collective motion of co-transcribing RNA polymerase molecules, supporting recent experimental observations. Additionally, large variations in mRNA production of a gene can arise from the constraints of supercoiling diffusion in a topological domain. At a multi-gene scale, we show that supercoiling dynamics allow two adjacent genes influence each others transcription kinetics, thus serving as a transcription regulator.",

    "abstract": "Fungi and oomycetes deliver effectors into living plant cells to suppress defenses and control plant processes needed for infection. Little is known about the mechanism by which these pathogens translocate effector proteins across the plasma membrane into the plant cytoplasm. The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae secretes cytoplasmic effectors into a specialized biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC) before translocation. Here we show that cytoplasmic effectors within BICs are packaged into vesicles that are occasionally observed in the host cytoplasm. Live cell imaging with fluorescently-labeled rice showed that effector vesicles colocalize with plant plasma membrane and with clathrin light chain-1, a marker for clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Inhibition of CME using Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) and chemical treatments results in cytoplasmic effectors in swollen BICs lacking vesicles. In contrast, fluorescent marker co-localization, VIGS and chemical inhibitor studies failed to support a major role for clathrin-independent endocytosis in effector vesicle formation. Localization studies of two novel effectors, and of known effectors after CME inhibition, indicate that cytoplasmic effector translocation occurs underneath appressoria before invasive hyphal growth. Taken together, this study provides evidence that cytoplasmic effector translocation is mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis in BICs and suggests a role for M. oryzae effectors in co-opting plant endocytosis.",

    "abstract": "Chloroplast is the site for transforming light energy to chemical energy. It also acts as a production unit for a variety of defense-related molecules. These defense moieties are necessary to mount a successful counter defence against pathogens including viruses. Geminiviruses disrupt chloroplast homeostasis as a basic strategy for their successful infection inducing vein-clearing, mosaics and chlorosis in infected plants. Here we show that a geminiviral pathogenicity determinant protein {beta}C1 directly interferes with plastid homeostasis. {beta}C1 was capable of inducing organelle-specific nuclease to degrade plastid genome as well as diverted functions of RecA1 protein, a major player in plastid genome maintenance. {beta}C1 interacted with RecA1 in plants and its homolog in bacteria to reduce the ability of host cells to maintain genomic integrity under stresses. Further, reduction in the coding capacity of plastids severely affected retrograde signalling necessary for viral perception and activation of defense. Induction of chloroplast-specific nuclease by {beta}C1 is similar to phosphate starvation-response in which nucleotides are recycled to augment synthesis of new, potentially viral, DNA. These results indicate the presence of a novel strategy in which a viral protein alters host defence by targeting regulators of chloroplast DNA. We predict that the mechanism identified here might have similarities in other plant-pathogen interactions.\n\nOne line summary{beta}C1 alters plastid genome metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The voltage-gated Na+ channel {beta}1 subunit, encoded by SCN1B, regulates cell surface expression and gating of  subunits, and participates in cell adhesion. {beta}1 is cleaved by /{beta} and {gamma}-secretases, releasing an extracellular domain and intracellular domain (ICD) respectively. Abnormal SCN1B expression/function is linked to pathologies including epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmia, and cancer. In this study, we sought to determine the effect of secretase cleavage on {beta}1 function in breast cancer cells. Using a series of GFP-tagged {beta}1 constructs, we show that {beta}1-GFP is mainly retained intracellularly, particularly in the endoplasmic reticulum and endolysosomal pathway, and accumulates in the nucleus. Reduction in endosomal {beta}1-GFP levels occurred following {gamma}-secretase inhibition, implicating endosomes, and/or the preceding plasma membrane, as important sites for secretase processing. Using live-cell imaging, we report {beta}1ICD-GFP accumulation in the nucleus. Furthermore, {beta}1-GFP and {beta}1ICD-GFP both increased Na+ current, whereas {beta}1STOP-GFP, which lacks the ICD, did not, thus highlighting that the {beta}1-ICD was necessary and sufficient to increase Na+ current measured at the plasma membrane. Importantly, although the endogenous Na+ current expressed in MDA-MB-231 cells is TTX-resistant (carried by Nav1.5), the Na+ current increased by {beta}1-GFP or {beta}1ICD-GFP was TTX-sensitive. In addition, {beta}1-GFP increased mRNA levels of the TTX-sensitive  subunits SCN1A/Nav1.1 and SCN9A/Nav1.7. Taken together, this work suggests that the {beta}1-ICD is a critical regulator of  subunit function in cancer cells. Our data further highlight that {gamma}-secretase may play a key role in regulating {beta}1 function in breast cancer.",

Glia displayed diversity related to positional identity along the dorso-ventral and rostro-caudal axes, while astrocytes with specialized transcriptional programs mapped onto distinct histological domains. We discovered a surprisingly early diversification of alpha () and gamma ({gamma}) motor neurons that control and modulate contraction of muscle fibers, which was suggestive of accelerated developmental timing in human spinal cord compared to rodents.

    "abstract": "Microglia take on an altered morphology during chronic opioid treatment. This morphological change is broadly used to identify the activated microglial state associated with opioid side effects, including tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH). Following chronic opioid treatment and peripheral nerve injury (PNI) microglia in the spinal cord display similar morphological responses. Consistent with this observation, functional studies have suggested that microglia activated by PNI or opioids engage common molecular mechanisms to induce hypersensitivity. Here we conducted deep RNA sequencing of acutely isolated spinal cord microglia from male mice to comprehensively interrogate transcriptional states and mechanistic commonality between multiple OIH and PNI models. Following PNI, we identify a common early proliferative transcriptional event across models that precedes the upregulation of histological markers of activation, followed by a delayed and injury-specific transcriptional response. Strikingly, we found no such transcriptional responses associated with opioid-induced microglial activation, consistent with histological data indicating that microglia number remain stable during morphine treatment. Collectively, these results reveal the diversity of pain-associated microglial transcriptomes and point towards the targeting of distinct insult-specific microglial responses to treat OIH, PNI, or other CNS pathologies.",
