    "abstract": "The human kidney is a complex organ with various cell types that are intricately organized to perform key physiological functions and maintain homeostasis. New imaging modalities such as mesoscale and highly multiplexed fluorescence microscopy are increasingly applied to human kidney tissue to create single cell resolution datasets that are both spatially large and multi-dimensional. These single cell resolution high-content imaging datasets have a great potential to uncover the complex spatial organization and cellular make-up of the human kidney. Tissue cytometry is a novel approach used for quantitative analysis of imaging data, but the scale and complexity of such datasets pose unique challenges for processing and analysis. We have developed the Volumetric Tissue Exploration and Analysis (VTEA) software, a unique tool that integrates image processing, segmentation and interactive cytometry analysis into a single framework on desktop computers. Supported by an extensible and open-source framework, VTEAs integrated pipeline now includes enhanced analytical tools, such as machine learning, data visualization, and neighborhood analyses for hyperdimensional large-scale imaging datasets. These novel capabilities enable the analysis of mesoscale two and three-dimensional multiplexed human kidney imaging datasets (such as CODEX and 3D confocal multiplexed fluorescence imaging). We demonstrate the utility of this approach in identifying cell subtypes in the kidney based on labels, spatial association and their microenvironment or neighborhood membership. VTEA provides integrated and intuitive approach to decipher the cellular and spatial complexity of the human kidney and complement other transcriptomics and epigenetic efforts to define the landscape of kidney cell types.",

    "abstract": "Homoeologous exchange (HE) is a major mechanism generating post-polyploidization genetic variation with important evolutionary consequences. However, the direct impacts of HE without entangling with additional evolutionary forces on gene expression remains to be fully understood. Here, we analyzed high-throughput RNA-seq data of young leaves from individuals of a synthetic allotetraploid wheat (AADD), which contain variable numbers of HEs. We aimed to investigate if and to which extent HE directly impacts gene expression and alternative splicing (AS). We found that HE impacts expression of genes located within HE regions primarily via cis-acting dosage effect, which led to significant changes in the total expression of homoeolog pairs, especially for homoeologs whose original expression was biased. In parallel, HE influences expression of a large amount of genes residing in non-HE regions by trans-regulation leading to convergent expression of homoeolog pairs. Intriguingly, when taking into account of the original relative homoeolog expression states, homoeolog pairs under trans-effect are more prone to showing convergent response to HE whereas those under cis-effect trended to show subgenome-specific expression. Moreover, HE induced quantitative, largely individual-specific, changes of alternative splicing (AS) events. Like homoeologs expression, homoeo-AS events which related to trans effect were more responsive to HE. HE therefore exerts multifaceted immediate effects on gene expression and, to a less extent, also transcript diversity in nascent allopolyploidy.",

    "abstract": "The study, engineering and application of biological networks require practical and efficient approaches. Current optimization efforts of these systems are often limited by wet lab labor and cost, as well as the lack of convenient, easily adoptable computational tools. Aimed at democratization and standardization, we describe METIS, a modular and versatile active machine learning workflow with a simple online interface for the optimization of biological target functions with minimal experimental datasets. We demonstrate our workflow for various applications, from simple to complex gene circuits and metabolic networks, including several cell-free transcription and translation systems, a LacI-based multi-level controller and a 27-variable synthetic CO2-fixation cycle (CETCH cycle). Using METIS, we could improve above systems between one and two orders of magnitude compared to their original setup with minimal experimental efforts. For the CETCH cycle, we explored the combinatorial space of [~]1025 conditions with only 1,000 experiments to yield the most efficient CO2-fixation cascade described to date. Beyond optimization, our workflow also quantifies the relative importance of individual factors to the performance of a system. This allows to identify so far unknown interactions and bottlenecks in complex systems, which paves the way for their hypothesis-driven improvement, which we demonstrate for the LacI multi-level controller that we were able to improve by 34-fold after having identified resource competition as limiting factor. Overall, our workflow opens the way for convenient optimization and prototyping of genetic and metabolic networks with customizable adjustments according to user experience, experimental setup, and laboratory facilities.",

    "abstract": "Each heartbeat is initiated by specialized pacemaker cells operating within the sinoatrial node (SAN). While individual cells within SAN tissue exhibit substantial heterogeneity of their electrophysiological parameters and Ca cycling, the role of this heterogeneity for cardiac pacemaker function remains mainly unknown. Here we investigated the problem numerically in a 25x25 square grid of coupled-clock Maltsev-Lakatta cell models and tested the hypothesis that functional heterogeneity of cell populations increases robustness of SAN function. The tissue models were populated by cells with different degree of heterogeneity of the two key model parameters of the coupled-clock system, maximum L-type Ca current conductance (gCaL) and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca pumping rate (Pup). Our simulations showed that in the areas of Pup-gCaL parametric space at the edge of the system stability where action potential (AP) firing was absent or dysrhythmic in tissues populated by identical cells, rhythmic AP generation was rescued in tissues populated by cells with uniformly random distributions of gCaL or Pup (but keeping the same average values). This effect to increase robust AP generation was synergistic with respect to heterogeneity in both gCaL and Pup and was further strengthened by clustering of cells with higher gCaL or Pup. The effect of functional heterogeneity was not due to a simple summation of activity of intrinsically firing cells naturally present in SAN; rather AP firing cells locally and critically interacted with non-firing/dormant cells. When firing cells prevailed, they recruited many dormant cells to fire, strongly enhancing overall SAN function. And vice versa, prevailing dormant cells suppressed AP firing in cells with intrinsic automaticity and halted SAN automaticity.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) on the water quality and shrimp growth performance during the grow-out culture of Litopenaeus vannamei in the biofloc system under a low salinity condition. Three biofloc treatments with an C:N (contained in the inputted feed and carbon source with the assumption that 75% of the feed nitrogen is excreted) of 8:1 (CN8), 16:1 (CN16) and 24:1 (CN24), respectively, were designed to stocking shrimp juveniles (~ 0.8 g) at a density of 270 individuals m-3, for a 63-days culture experiment at a salinity of about 5{per thousand}. Results showed that in CN8 treatment, the levels of pH (6.9{+/-}0.1), carbonate alkalinity (104.0{+/-}2.8mg L-1 CaCO3), biofloc volume (4.8{+/-}0.9mL L-1) and TSS (327.4{+/-}24.4mg L-1) were significantly lower than those in the other two treatments ([&ge;]7.6{+/-}0.3, [&ge;]157.6{+/-}21.6mg L-1 CaCO3, [&ge;]24.1{+/-}3.7mL L-1 and [&ge;]508.1{+/-}32.3mg L-1, P<0.05); whereas the levels of TAN (7.1{+/-}0.9mg L-1), nitrite (14.0{+/-}3.6mg L-1) and nitrate (77.0{+/-}5.0mg L-1) were significantly higher than those in the other treatments ([&le;]2.0{+/-}0.6mg L-1, [&le;]4.9{+/-}3.1mg L-1 and [&le;]14.7{+/-}5.9mg L-1, P<0.05). The zootechnical parameters of shrimp were not significantly different between three treatments (P>0.05), except that the survival rates in CN16 treatment (96.8{+/-}2.0%) and CN24 treatment (93.7{+/-}4.2%) were significantly higher than that of CN8 treatment (81.5{+/-}6.4%, P<0.05). The results indicated that an inputted C:N higher than 16:1 was suitable for the biofloc system with a low salinity of 5{per thousand}, with an optimal inferred C:N range of 18.5-21.0:1 for water quality and growth performance.",

    "abstract": "Learning goal-directed behaviours requires integration of separate information streams representing context, relevant stimuli and reward. Dendrites of pyramidal neurons are suitable sites for such integration, but it remains elusive how their responses adapt when an animal learns a new task. Here, we identify two distinct classes of dendritic responses that represent either contextual/sensory information or reward information and that differ in their task- and learning-related dynamics. Using longitudinal calcium imaging of apical dendritic tufts of L5 pyramidal neurons in mouse barrel cortex, we tracked dendritic activity across learning and analyzed both local dendritic branch signals and global apical tuft activity. During texture discrimination learning, sensory representations (including contextual and touch information) strengthened and converged on the reward-predicting tactile stimulus when mice became experts. In contrast, reward-associated responses were particularly strong in the naive condition and became less pronounced upon learning. When we blocked the representation of unexpected reward in naive animals with optogenetic inhibition, animals failed to learn until we released the block and learning proceeded normally. Our results suggest that reward signals in dendrites are essential for adjusting neuronal integration of converging inputs to facilitate adaptive behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Since December 2019, the novel human coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally, causing millions of deaths. Unprecedented efforts have enabled development and authorization of a range of vaccines, which reduce transmission rates and confer protection against the associated disease COVID-19. These vaccines are conceptually diverse, including e.g. classical adjuvanted whole-inactivated virus, viral vectors, and mRNA vaccines.\n\nWe have analysed two prototypic model vaccines, the strongly TH1-biased measles vaccine-derived candidate MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) and a TH2-biased Alum-adjuvanted, non-stabilized Spike (S) protein side-by-side, for their ability to protect Syrian hamsters upon challenge with a low-passage SARS-CoV-2 patient isolate. As expected, the MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) vaccine protected the hamsters safely from severe disease. In contrast, the protein vaccine induced vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) with massive infiltration of eosinophils into the lungs. Global RNA-Seq analysis of hamster lungs revealed reduced viral RNA and less host dysregulation in MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H) vaccinated animals, while S protein vaccination triggered enhanced host gene dysregulation compared to unvaccinated control animals. Of note, mRNAs encoding the major eosinophil attractant CCL-11, the TH2 response-driving cytokine IL-19, as well as TH2-cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were exclusively up-regulated in the lungs of S protein vaccinated animals, consistent with previously described VAERD induced by RSV vaccine candidates. IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 were also up-regulated in S-specific splenocytes after protein vaccination. Using scRNA-Seq, T cells and innate lymphoid cells were identified as the source of these cytokines, while Ccl11 and Il19 mRNAs were expressed in lung macrophages displaying an activated phenotype. Interestingly, the amount of viral reads in this macrophage population correlated with the abundance of Fc-receptor reads. These findings suggest that VAERD is triggered by induction of TH2-type helper cells secreting IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, together with stimulation of macrophage subsets dependent on non-neutralizing antibodies. Via this mechanism, uncontrolled eosinophil recruitment to the infected tissue occurs, a hallmark of VAERD immunopathogenesis. These effects could effectively be treated using dexamethasone and were not observed in animals vaccinated with MeVvac2-SARS2-S(H).\n\nTaken together, our data validate the potential of TH2-biased COVID-19 vaccines and identify the transcriptional mediators that underlie VAERD, but confirm safety of TH1-biased vaccine concepts such as vector-based or mRNA vaccines. Dexamethasone, which is already in use for treatment of severe COVID-19, may alleviate such VAERD, but in-depth scrutiny of any next-generation protein-based vaccine candidates is required, prior and after their regulatory approval.",
