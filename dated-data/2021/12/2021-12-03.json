    "abstract": "B cells contribute to the pathogenesis of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Clinically, metformin is used to treat PCOS, but it is unclear whether metformin exerts its therapeutic effect by regulating B cells. Here, we showed that the expression level of TNF- in peripheral blood B cells from PCOS patient was increased. Metformin used in vitro and in vivo was able to reduce the production of TNF- in B cells from PCOS patient. Administration of metformin improved mouse PCOS phenotypes induced by dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and also inhibited TNF- expression in splenic B cells. Further, metformin induced metabolic reprogramming of B cells in PCOS patients, including the alteration in mitochondrial morphology, the decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, ROS production and glucose uptake. In DHEA-induced mouse PCOS model, metformin altered metabolic intermediates in splenic B cells. Moreover, the inhibition of TNF- expression and metabolic reprogramming in B cells of PCOS patients and mouse model by metformin were associated with decreased mTOR phosphorylation. Together, TNF--producing B cells are involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS, and metformin inhibits mTOR phosphorylation and affects metabolic reprogramming, thereby inhibiting TNF- expression in B cells, which may be a new mechanism of metformin in the treatment of PCOS.",

    "abstract": "The centriole/basal body (CBB) is an evolutionarily conserved organelle acting as a microtubule organising centre (MTOC) to nucleate cilia, flagella and the centrosome. SAS4/CPAP is a conserved component associated with BB biogenesis in many model flagellated cells. Plasmodium, a divergent unicellular eukaryote and causative agent of malaria, displays an atypical closed mitosis with an MTOC, reminiscent of the acentriolar MTOC, embedded in the nuclear membrane at most proliferative stages. Mitosis during male gamete formation is accompanied by flagellum formation: within 15 minutes, genome replication (from 1N to 8N) and three successive rounds of mitosis without nuclear division occur, with coordinated axoneme biogenesis in the cytoplasm resulting in eight flagellated gametes. There are two MTOCs in male gametocytes. An acentriolar MTOC located with the nuclear envelope and a centriolar MTOC (basal body) located within the cytoplasm that are required for flagellum assembly. To study the location and function of SAS4 during this rapid process, we examined the spatial profile of SAS4 in real time by live cell imaging and its function by gene deletion. We show its absence during asexual proliferation but its presence and coordinated association and assembly of SAS4 with another basal body component, kinesin8B, which is involved in axoneme biogenesis. In contrast its separation from the nuclear kinetochore marker NDC80 suggests that SAS4 is part of the basal body and outer centriolar MTOC residing in the cytoplasm. However, deletion of the SAS4 gene produced no phenotype, indicating that it is not essential for male gamete formation or parasite transmission through the mosquito.",

    "abstract": "Tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters are widespread in bacteria and archaea and provide important uptake routes for many metabolites 1-3. They consist of three structural domains, a soluble substrate-binding protein (P-domain), and two transmembrane domains (Q- and M-domains) that form a functional unit 4. While the structures of the P-domains are well-known, an experimental structure of any QM-domain has been elusive. HiSiaPQM is a TRAP transporter for the monocarboxylate sialic acid, which plays a key role in the virulence of pathogenic bacteria 5. Here, we present the first cryo-electron microscopy structure of the membrane domains of HiSiaPQM reconstituted in lipid nanodiscs. The reconstruction reveals that TRAP transporters consist of 15 transmembrane helices and are structurally related to elevator-type transporters, such as GltPh and VcINDY 6, 7. Whereas the latter proteins function as multimers, the idiosyncratic Q-domain of TRAP transporters enables the formation of a monomeric elevator architecture. Structural and mutational analyses together with an AlphaFold 8 model of the tripartite (PQM) complex reveal the structural and conformational coupling of the substrate-binding protein to the transporter domains. Furthermore, we characterize high-affinity VHHs that bind to the periplasmic side of HiSiaQM and inhibit sialic acid uptake in vivo. Thereby, they also confirm the orientation of the protein in the membrane. Our study provides the first structure of any binding-protein dependent secondary transporter and provides starting points for the development of specific inhibitors.",

    "abstract": "Phylogenetics has been foundational to SARS-CoV-2 research and public health policy, assisting in genomic surveillance, contact tracing, and assessing emergence and spread of new variants. However, phylogenetic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 have often relied on tools designed for de novo phylogenetic inference, in which all data are collected before any analysis is performed and the phylogeny is inferred once from scratch. SARS-CoV-2 datasets do not fit this mould. There are currently over 10 million sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes in online databases, with tens of thousands of new genomes added every day. Continuous data collection, combined with the public health relevance of SARS-CoV-2, invites an \"online\" approach to phylogenetics, in which new samples are added to existing phylogenetic trees every day. The extremely dense sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes also invites a comparison between likelihood and parsimony approaches to phylogenetic inference. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods are more accurate when there are multiple changes at a single site on a single branch, but this accuracy comes at a large computational cost, and the dense sampling of SARS-CoV-2 genomes means that these instances will be extremely rare because each internal branch is expected to be extremely short. Therefore, it may be that approaches based on maximum parsimony (MP) are sufficiently accurate for reconstructing phylogenies of SARS-CoV-2, and their simplicity means that they can be applied to much larger datasets. Here, we evaluate the performance of de novo and online phylogenetic approaches, and ML and MP frameworks, for inferring large and dense SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies. Overall, we find that online phylogenetics produces similar phylogenetic trees to de novo analyses for SARS-CoV-2, and that MP optimizations produce more accurate SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies than do ML optimizations. Since MP is thousands of times faster than presently available implementations of ML and online phylogenetics is faster than de novo, we therefore propose that, in the context of comprehensive genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, MP online phylogenetics approaches should be favored.",

    "abstract": "Emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants, especially those of concern, may have an impact on the viruss transmissibility and pathogenicity, as well as diagnostic equipment performance and vaccine effectiveness. Even though the SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant (B.1.617.2) emerged during Indias second wave of infections, Delta variants have grown dominant internationally and are still evolving. On November 26, 2021, WHO identified the variant B.1.1.529 as a variant of concern, naming it Omicron, based on evidence that Omicron contains numerous mutations that may influence its behaviour. However, the mode of transmission and severity of the Omicron variant remains unknown. We used computational studies to examine the Delta and Omicron variants in this work and found that the Omicron variant had a higher affinity for human ACE2 than the Delta variant due to a significant number of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain, indicating a higher potential for transmission. Based on docking studies, the Q493R, N501Y, S371L, S373P, S375F, Q498R, and T478K mutations contribute significantly to high binding affinity with human ACE2. In comparison to the Delta variant, both the entire spike protein and the RBD in Omicron include a high proportion of hydrophobic amino acids such as leucine and phenylalanine. These amino acids are located within the proteins core and are required for structural stability. Omicron has a higher percentage of alpha-helix structure than the Delta variant in both whole spike protein and RBD, indicating that it has a more stable structure. We observed a disorder-order transition in the Omicron variant between spike protein RBD regions 468-473, and it may be significant in the influence of disordered residues/regions on spike protein stability and binding to ACE2. A future study might investigate the epidemiological and biological consequences of the Omicron variant.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV2 spike glycoprotein is prime target for vaccines and for diagnostics and therapeutic antibodies against the virus. While anchored in the viral envelope, for effective virulance, the spike needs to maintain structural flexibility to recognize the host cell surface receptors and bind to them, a property that can heavily hinge upon the dynamics of the unresolved domains, most prominently the stalk. Construction of the complete, membrane-bound spike model and the description of its dynamics remain critical steps in understanding the inner working of this key element in viral infection. Using a hybrid approach, combining homology modeling, protein-protein docking and MD simulations, guided by biochemical and glycomics data, we have developed a full-length, membrane-bound, palmitoylated and fully-glycosylated spike structure in a native membrane. Multi-microsecond MD simulations of this model, the longest known trajectory of the full-spike, reveals conformational dynamics employed by the protein to explore the crowded surface of the host cell. In agreement with cryoEM, three flexiblele hinges in stalk allow for global conformational heterogeneity of spike in the fully-glycosyslated system mediated by glycan-glycan and glycan-lipid interactions. Dynamical range of spike is considerably reduced in its non-glycosylated form, confining the area explored by the spike on the host cell surface. Furthermore, palmitoylation of the membrane domain amplify the local curvature that may prime the fusion. We show that the identified hinge regions are highly conserved in SARS coronaviruses, highlighting their functional importance in enhancing viral infection, and thereby provide novel points for discovery of alternative therapeutics against the virus.\n\nSignificanceSARS-CoV2 Spike protein, which forms the basis for high pathogenicity and transmissibility of the virus, is also prime target for the development of both diagnostics and vaccines for the debilitating disease caused by the virus. We present a full model of spike methodically crafted and used to study its atomic-level dynamics by multiple-{micro}s simulations. The results shed new light on the impact of posttranslational modifications in the pathogenicity of the virus. We show how glycan-glycan and glycan-lipid interactions broaden the proteins dynamical range, and thereby, its effective interaction with the surface receptors on the host cell. Palmitoylation of spike membrane domain, on the other hand, results in a unique deformation pattern that might prime the membrane for fusion.",

    "abstract": "As the structural unit of life, cell is defined by the membrane system. The cell membrane separates the internal and external environment of the cell, and the endomembrane system defines the organelles to perform different functions1-3. However, lack of tools to in situ observe membrane proteins at a molecular resolution has limited our understanding of membrane organization and membrane protein interactions. Here we characterize the high-resolution 3D structure of human red blood cell (hRBC) membranes and the membrane proteins for the first time in situ by cryo-electron tomography (CryoET)4-7. By analyzing tomograms, we have obtained the first fine three-dimensional (3D) structure of hRBC membranes and found the asymmetrical distribution of membrane proteins on both sides of the membranes. We found that the membrane proteins are mainly located on the cytoplasmic side of hRBC membranes, with protein sizes ranging from 6nm to 8nm, in contrast to the ectoplasmic side with basically no proteins. Quantitative analysis of the density of hRBC membrane proteins shows that the membranes with higher protein occupancy have less phospholipid, making the membranes more rigid. Meanwhile, we obtained the channel protein-like structures by preliminary analysis of the membrane protein. Our results represent the first in situ structure characterization of the cell membranes and membrane proteins through cryoET and opens the door for understanding the biological functions of cell membranes in their physiological environments.",

Through benchmarking against a set of 798 ground truth interactions and an equal number of noninteractions, we have found that PEPPI attains 4.5% higher AUROC than the best of other state-of-the-art methods. As a proteomic-scale application, PEPPI was applied to model the interactions which occur between SARS-CoV-2 and human host cells during coronavirus infection, where 403 high-confidence interactions were identified with predictions covering 73% of a gold standard dataset from PSICQUIC and demonstrating significant complementarity with the most recent high-throughput experiments.

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWSpiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) relay auditory information from cochlear hair cells to the central nervous system. After hair cells are destroyed by aminoglycoside antibiotics, SGNs gradually die. However, the reasons for this cochlear neurodegeneration are unclear. We used microarray gene expression profiling to assess transcriptomic changes in the spiral ganglia of kanamycin-deafened and age-matched control rats and found that many of the genes upregulated after deafening are associated with immune/inflammatory responses. In support of this, we observed increased numbers of macrophages in the spiral ganglion of deafened rats. We also found, via CD68 immunoreactivity, an increase in activated macrophages after deafening. An increase in CD68-associated nuclei was observed by postnatal day 23, a time before significant SGN degeneration is observed. Finally, we show that the immunosuppressive drugs dexamethasone and ibuprofen, as well as the NAD salvage pathway activator P7C3, provide at least some neuroprotection post-deafening. Ibuprofen and dexamethasone also decreased the degree of macrophage activation. These results suggest that activated macrophages specifically, and perhaps a more general neuroinflammatory response, are actively contributing to SGN degeneration after hair cell loss.",

Yet whether LINE-1 dysregulation is causal to disease pathogenesis has not been proven directly. Here, we demonstrate that expression of evolutionarily younger LINE-1 families is elevated in the cerebella of ataxia telangiectasia (AT) patients, which was correlated with extensive downregulation of epigenetic silencers. To examine whether LINE-1 activation causes neurologic disease, we established an approach to directly target and activate the promoter of a young family of LINE-1 in mice. LINE-1 activation in the cerebellum was sufficient to lead to robust progressive ataxia. Purkinje cells in the diseased mice exhibited marked electrophysiological dysfunctions and degeneration with a significant accumulation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein LINE-1Orf1p aggregates, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and DNA damage. Treatment with lamivudine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, blunted the disease progression by reducing DNA damage, attenuating gliosis and interferon gene signature, and recovering the loss of key functional molecules for calcium homeostasis in Purkinje cells. This study provides direct evidence that young LINE-1 activation drives ataxia phenotype, and points to its pleiotropic effects leading to DNA damage, inflammation, and dysfunction and degeneration of neurons.",

Signals driving expansion of DN2 thymocytes are well studied, however, factors regulating the proliferation and survival of DN4 cells remain poorly understood. Here, we uncover an unexpected link between the transcription factor Zfp335 and control of cGAS/STING-dependent cell death in post-{beta}-selection DN4 thymocytes. Zfp335 controls survival by sustaining expression of Ankle2, which suppresses cGAS/STING-dependent cell death.

    "abstract": "The thermophilic fungus Oidiodendron flavum is a saprobe that is commonly isolated from soil. Here, we identified a Gram-positive bacteria-selective antimicrobial secondary metabolite from this fungal species, harzianic acid (HA). Using Bacillus subtilis strain 168 combined with several assays, we found that HA targeted the cell membrane, though only at high concentrations. To further study the antimicrobial activity of HA, we isolated an HA-resistant strain, Bacillus subtilis strain M9015, and discovered that the mutant has more translucent colonies, has cross resistance to rifampin, and harbors five mutations in the coding region of four distinct genes. Further analysis of these genes indicated that the mutation in atpE might be responsible for the translucency of the colony, and mutation in yusO for resistance to both HA and rifampin. We conclude that HA is a multi-target antimicrobial agent against Gram-positive bacteria.",

    "abstract": "While a range of methods for stool collection exist, many require complicated, self-directed protocols and stool transfer. In this study, we introduce and validate a novel, wipe-based approach to fecal sample collection and stabilization for metagenomics analysis. A total of 72 samples were collected across four different preservation types: freezing at -20{degrees}C, room temperature storage, a commercial DNA preservation kit, and DESS (dimethyl sulfoxide, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, sodium chloride) solution. These samples were sequenced and analyzed for taxonomic abundance metrics, metabolic pathway classification, and diversity analysis. Overall, the DESS wipe results validated the use of a wipe-based capture method to collect stool samples for microbiome analysis, showing an R2 of 0.96 for species across all kingdoms, as well as exhibiting a maintenance of Shannon diversity (3.1-3.3) and species richness (151-159) compared to frozen samples. Moreover, DESS showed comparable performance to the commercially available preservation kit (R2 of 0.98), and samples consistently clustered by subject across each method. Future studies will be needed to further explore sample processing options and their applications in non-healthy subjects, particularly patients with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer, but these data suggest the DESS wipe method can be used for stable, room temperature collection and transport of human stool specimens.",

    "abstract": "Increasing cases of SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections from immunization with predominantly spike protein based COVID-19 vaccines highlight the need for alternative vaccines using different platforms and/or antigens. In this study, we expressed SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in a novel vaccinia virus ACAM2000 platform (rACAM2000). Following a single intramuscular immunization, the rACAM2000 co-expressing the spike and nucleocapsid proteins induced significantly improved protection against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in comparison to rACAM2000 expressing the individual proteins in a hamster model, as shown by reduced weight loss and quicker recovery time. The protection was associated with reduced viral loads, increased neutralizing antibody titre and reduced neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. Thus, our study demonstrates that the rACAM2000 expressing a combination of the spike and nucleocapsid antigens is a promising COVID-19 vaccine candidate and further studies will investigate if the rACAM2000 vaccine candidate can induce a long lasting immunity against infection of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.",

We used next-generation sequencing to identify the microbial communities of S. frugiperda from corn fields in Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Panama, Paraguay, and Peru, and rice fields from Panama. The larval gut microbiota of S. frugiperda larvae did not differ between the host strains neither was it affected by the geographical distribution of the populations investigated. Our findings provide additional support for Enterococcus and Pseudomonas as core members of the bacterial community associated with the larval gut of S. frugiperda, regardless of the site of collection or strain, suggesting that these bacteria may maintain true symbiotic relationships with the fall armyworm. Further investigations are required for a deeper understanding of the nature of this relationship.",

    "abstract": "Bacterial wilt (BW) is a soil-borne disease that severely impacts plant growth and productivity globally. Ubiquitination plays a crucial role in disease resistance. Our previous research indicated that NAC transcription factor SmNAC negatively regulates BW resistance in eggplant (Solanum melongena). However, whether the ubiquitin/26S proteasome system (UPS) participates in this regulation is unknown.\n\nThis study used SmNAC as a bait to screen eggplant cDNA library and obtained SmDDA1b, an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Subcellular location and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays revealed that SmDDA1b could interact with SmNAC in the nucleus. The in vivo and in vitro ubiquitination experiments indicated that SmDDA1b can degrade SmNAC through UPS. However, the discovery of negative regulation of SmDDA1b expression by SmNAC showed that there was a negative feedback loop between SmNAC and SmDDA1b in eggplant.\n\nThe SmDDA1b-overexpressed lines showed a higher BW resistance associated with high expression levels of salicylic acid (SA)-related genes and SA content than the wild-type lines. However, SmDDA1b-silencing lines showed the opposite results, indicating that SmDDA1b is a positive regulatory gene for BW resistance.\n\nThis study provides a candidate gene that can enhance BW resistance in eggplants. In addition, it provides insight into a mechanism that promotes plant disease resistance via the SmDDA1b-SmNAC-SA pathway.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR technology has made generation of gene knockouts widely achievable in cells. However, once inactivated, their reactivation remains difficult, especially in diploid cells. Here, we present DExCon (Doxycycline-mediated endogenous gene Expression Control), DExogron (DExCon combined with auxin-mediated targeted protein degradation) and LUXon (light responsive DExCon), approaches which combine one-step CRISPR-Cas9 mediated targeted knock-in of fluorescent proteins with an advanced Tet-inducible TRE3GS promoter. These approaches combine blockade of active gene transcription with the ability to reactivate transcription on demand, including activation of silenced genes. Systematic control can be exerted using doxycycline or spatiotemporally by light, and we demonstrate functional knockout/rescue in the closely related Rab11 family of vesicle trafficking regulators. Fluorescent protein knock-in results in bright signals compatible with low-light live microscopy from monoallelic modification, the potential to simultaneously image different alleles of the same gene and bypasses the need to work with clones. Protein levels are easily tunable to correspond with endogenous expression through cell sorting (DExCon), timing of light illumination (LUXon) or by exposing cells to different levels of auxin (DExogron). Furthermore, our approach allowed us to quantify previously unforeseen differences in vesicle dynamics, expression kinetics and protein stability among highly similar endogenous Rab11 family members and their colocalization in triple knock-in cells.\n\nGRAPHICAL ABSTRACT O_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY\n\nIN BRIEFWe describe development of DExCon, LUXon and DExogron approaches, where a single CRIPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing event can block endogenous gene expression, with the ability to reactivate expression encoded such that even silent genes can be expressed.

    "abstract": "Small intestinal villi are structural and functional units uniquely adapted to the nutrient absorption in higher vertebrates. Villus enterocytes are organized in spatially resolved \"zones\" dedicated to specialized tasks such anti-bacterial protection, and absorption of amino-acids, carbohydrates and lipids. The molecular mechanisms specifying villus zonation are incompletely understood. We report that inactivation of transcription factor c-MAF, highly expressed in mature lower and mid-villus enterocytes, perturbed the entire villus zonation program, by increasing the expression of regulators of carbohydrate and bile acid metabolism and transport, while suppressing genes related to amino acid and lipid absorption. Maf inactivation under homeostatic conditions expanded tuft cells and led to compensatory gut lengthening, preventing body weight loss. However, delayed enterocyte maturation in the absence of Maf impaired body weight recovery after acute intestinal injury, resulting in reduced survival. Our results identify c-MAF as a novel regulator of small intestinal villus zonation program, while highlighting the importance of coordination between stem/progenitor and differentiation programs for intestinal regeneration.\n\nSummaryc-MAF is expressed in differentiated enterocytes. c-MAF loss alters enterocyte zonation leading to a compensatory gut remodelling and tuft cell expansion. Upon acute intestinal injury mice deficient for c-MAF cannot recover due to lack of nutrient transport and compensatory lengthening.",

    "abstract": "We asked what peptide features govern targeting to the mitochondria versus the chloroplast using antimicrobial peptides as a starting point. This approach was inspired by the endosymbiotic hypothesis that organelle-targeting peptides derive from antimicrobial amphipathic peptides delivered by the host cell, to which organelle progenitors became resistant. To explore the molecular changes required to convert antimicrobial into targeting peptides, we expressed a set of 13 antimicrobial peptides in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Peptides were systematically modified to test distinctive features of mitochondrial and chloroplast targeting peptides, and we assessed their targeting potential by following the intracellular localization and maturation of a Venus fluorescent reporter used as cargo protein. Mitochondrial targeting can be achieved by some unmodified antimicrobial peptide sequences. Targeting to both organelles is improved by replacing Lysines with Arginines. Chloroplast targeting is enabled by the presence of flanking unstructured sequences, additional constraints consistent with chloroplast endosymbiosis having occurred in a cell that already contained mitochondria. If indeed targeting peptides evolved from antimicrobial peptides, required modifications imply a temporal evolutionary scenario with an early exchange of cationic residues, and a late acquisition of chloroplast specific motifs.",

    "abstract": "Argonaute proteins use nucleic acid guides to find and bind specific DNA or RNA target sequences. Argonaute proteins can be found in all kingdoms of life, and play diverse biological functions including genome defense, gene regulation, and chromosome partitioning. Many Argonautes retain their ancestral endoribonuclease activity, cleaving the phosphodiester bond between target nucleotides t10 and t11. In animals, a specialized class of Argonautes, the PIWI proteins, use 21-35 nt PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) to direct transposon silencing, protect the germline genome, and regulate gene expression during gametogenesis1. The piRNA pathway is required for fertility in one or both sexes of nearly all animals. Both piRNA production and function require RNA cleavage catalyzed by PIWI proteins. Spermatogenesis in mice and other placental mammals requires three distinct, developmentally regulated PIWI proteins: MIWI (PIWIL1), MILI (PIWIL2), and MIWI2 (PIWIL4)2-4. The piRNA-guided endoribonuclease activities of MIWI and MILI are essential to produce functional sperm5, 6. piRNA-directed silencing in mice and insects also requires Gametocyte-Specific Factor 1 (GTSF1), a PIWI-associated protein of unknown function7-12. Here, we report that GTSF1 potentiates the weak, intrinsic, piRNA-directed RNA cleavage activities of PIWI proteins, transforming them into efficient endoribonucleases. GTSF1 represents the first example of an auxiliary protein that potentiates the catalytic activity of an Argonaute protein.",

    "abstract": "Various signaling molecules affecting epithelial restitution and wound healing are dysregulated in ulcerative colitis. Recent evidence demonstrates the necessity of Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling, interceded by cytoskeletal remodeling, for intestinal regeneration. Death-associated protein kinase 3 (DAPK3) is a regulator of actin cytoskeleton reorganization that controls proliferation and apoptosis. Pharmacological inhibition of DAPK3 in Caco-2 human intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) with the HS38 compound augmented cell proliferation and enhanced wound closure. This phenotype corresponded with the increased colocalization of Yes-associated protein (YAP) with F-actin, which is indicative of YAP activation. The administration of HS38 impeded the resolution of intestinal injury and attenuated epithelial-specific proliferation after acute colitis induced by dextran-sodium-sulphate (DSS) in mice. During recovery from DSS-induced colitis, IEC proliferation was repressed, and mice exhibited increased disease severity when HS38 was applied to inhibit DAPK3. Moreover, HS38 treatment increased YAP nuclear localization in IECs, an indicator of signal activation. In summary, this study established DAPK3 as a key factor in intestinal epithelial regeneration and colitis progression by way of YAP signaling. Nevertheless, the role that DAPK3 play in different cell types will need further investigation to decipher the full consequence of DAPK3 inhibition on epithelial homeostasis.",

    "abstract": "Researching the complete life cycles of migratory animals is essential for understanding conservation and population dynamics. Many studies focus on the breeding season, but surviving winter is equally important. Living in groups during winter can play a vital role as social connections within groups can provide many benefits such as protection from predators and increased access to resources. However, it is often unknown how social connections change across seasons in migratory animals. We focus on social connections in a migratory bird and ask whether social connections in winter continue during breeding. Golden-crowned sparrows have distinct, stable winter communities which include both site and group fidelity across years: birds almost always rejoin the same social community each year. If these birds have social connectivity across migration, we would expect individuals that associate in winter would also associate together on their breeding grounds. Our small-scale GPS tagging study combined with intensive social behavior data revealed that sparrows in the same tightly-knit winter community migrated to highly disparate locations during summer, showing that social connections in winter do not continue in summer. This suggests that golden-crowned sparrows have entirely separate social structures across seasons and that long-term social memories allow them to reform stable groups each winter.",

Here, we show that the Rho family guanine nucleotide exchange factor Syx promotes GBM cell growth both in vitro and in orthotopic GBM patient-derived xenografts. Growth defects upon Syx depletion are attributed to prolonged mitosis, increased DNA damage, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and cell apoptosis, mediated by altered mRNA and protein expression of various cell cycle regulators. These effects are phenocopied by depletion of the Rho downstream effector Dia1 and are due at least in part to increased cytoplasmic retention and reduced activity of the YAP/TAZ transcriptional coactivators. Further, targeting Syx signaling cooperates with radiation treatment and temozolomide (TMZ) to decrease viability in GBM cells irrespective of their inherent response to TMZ. Taken together, the data indicate that a Syx-RhoA-Dia1-YAP/TAZ signaling axis regulates cell cycle progression, DNA damage, and therapy resistance in GBM and argue for its targeting for cancer treatment.\n\nOne Sentence SummarySyx promotes growth and therapy resistance in glioblastoma.",

    "abstract": "Anhydrobiosis is considered to be an adaptation of important applicative implications because it enables resistance to the lack of water. The phenomenon is still not well understood at molecular level. Thus, a good model invertebrate species for the research is required. The best known anhydrobiotic invertebrates are tardigrades (Tardigrada), considered to be toughest animals in the world. Hypsibius. exemplaris is one of the best studied tardigrade species, with its name \"exemplaris\" referring to the widespread use of the species as a laboratory model for various types of research. However, available data suggest that anhydrobiotic capability of the species may be overestimated. Therefore, we determined anhydrobiosis survival by Hys. exemplaris specimens using three different anhydrobiosis protocols. We also checked ultrastructure of storage cells within formed dormant structures (tuns) that has not been studied yet for Hys. exemplaris. These cells are known to support energetic requirements of anhydrobiosis. The obtained results indicate that Hys. exemplaris appears not to be a good model species for anhydrobiosis research.",

    "abstract": "High field MRI represents an advanced technique both for diagnostic and research purposes on animal models such as the Beagle dog. The increasing interest in non-invasive neuroscience, aging, and neuropathological research led to a need of reference values (in terms of volumetric assessment) for the typical brain structures involved and, nowadays, several canine brain MRI atlases have been provided. Since no reports are available regarding the measurements reproducibility and few information are available about formalin fixation effect on brain structures when applied to MRI segmentation, we assessed the segmentation variability of selected structures as a function of the operator (two operators segmented the same data) and their intrinsic variability within a sample of 11 Beagle dogs (9 females and 2 males, 1.6 {+/-} 0.2 years). Then, we analyzed for one further Beagle dog (2 years old) the longitudinal changes in the brain segmentations of these structures corresponding four conditions: in vivo, post mortem (after euthanasia), ex vivo (brain extracted and studied after 1 month in formalin and after 11 months); all the MRI images were collected with a 3 T MRI scanner. Our findings suggest that the segmentation procedure can be considered overall reproducible since only slight statistical differences were detected, apart from the ventricles.\n\nFurthermore, in the post mortem/ ex vivo comparison, the majority of the structures showed a higher contrast leading to more reproducible segmentations across operators and a net increase of volume of the studied structures; this could be justified by the intrinsic relaxation time changes observed as a consequence of formalin fixation, that led to an improvement of brain structures visualization and then segmentation.\n\nTo conclude, MRI based segmentation seems to be a useful and accurate tool that allows longitudinal studies, especially when applied to formalin fixed brains.",

    "abstract": "PurposeSimple psychophysical paradigm is available as a digital application in iOS devices such as iPad to measure the function of ON and OFF visual pathways. However, an age-matched normative database is not readily available. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the response of ON and OFF visual pathways as a function of age.\n\nMethods158 normal healthy adults (84 males and 74 females) whose age ranged 18-80 years participated in the study. None of them had any ocular disease (except cataract of grade II or less) and visual acuity of [&le;] 20/25. Monocular testing (only one eye) was performed on the  EyeSpeed application on an iPad at 40cm distance. The targets ranged between 1 to 3 light or dark squares presented randomly in a noise background and participants responded by indicating the number of squares by touching the screen as fast as possible. The main outcome variables are reaction time, accuracy and performance index (1 / speed * accuracy).\n\nResultsThe median reaction time was shorter (Median (IQR): 1.53s (0.49) [dark] Vs 1.76s (0.58) [light], p < 0.001) and accuracy was higher (97.21% (3.30) [dark] Vs 95.15% (5.10) [light], p < 0.001) for dark targets than the light targets. Performance index and reaction time for both target types significantly correlated with age ({rho} = -0.41 to -0.43; p < 0.001).\n\nConclusionsThis normative database will be useful to quantify disease-specific defects. More importantly, the ON pathway function can potentially serve as a surrogate for rod photoreceptor function.",

    "abstract": "The origin of mammalian mitochondria and plant chloroplasts is thought to be endosymbiosis. Millennia ago, a bacterium related to typhus-causing bacteria may have been consumed by a proto-eukaryote and over time evolved into an organelle inside eukaryotic cells, known as a mitochondrion. The plant chloroplast is believed to have evolved in a similar fashion from cyanobacteria. This project attempted to use \"directed endosymbiosis\" (my term) to investigate if chloroplasts can be taken up by a land animal and continue to function. It has been shown previously that mouse fibroblasts could incorporate isolated chloroplasts when co-cultured. Photosynthetic bacteria containing chloroplasts have been successfully injected into zebrafish embryos, mammalian cells, and ischemic rodent hearts. The photosynthetic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (C. reinhardtii) has also been injected into zebrafish embryos. However, to the best of my knowledge, injection of isolated chloroplasts into a land animal embryo has not been attempted before.\n\nIn four pilot experiments, solutions of chloroplasts in PBS were microinjected into Drosophila melanogaster (D. melanogaster) embryos to determine if the embryos would tolerate the foreign protein. Interestingly, results indicated that a portion of the D. melanogaster embryos appeared to tolerate the injections and survive to adulthood. To determine if chloroplasts had indeed been transferred, larvae were placed under fluorescent microscopy. Chlorophyll (serving as the reporter) was found to be present in several larvae and to decline in amount over time. To investigate if the chloroplasts still functioned, a radiotracer food intake assay was performed. It was hypothesized that if the chloroplasts were generating ATP (and possibly glucose), the larvae might need less food. Results indicated a decrease in intake, however this might have occurred for other reasons.",

    "abstract": "Filamentous molecules tend to spontaneously assemble into liquid crystalline droplets with a tactoid morphology in the environments with the high concentration on non-adsorbing molecules. Tactoids of filamentous Pf bacteriophage, such as those produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, have been linked with increased antibiotic tolerance. We modelled this system and show that tactoids, composed of filamentous Pf virions, can lead to antibiotic tolerance by acting as an adsorptive diffusion barrier. The continuum model, reminiscent of descriptions of reactive diffusion in porous media, has been solved numerically and good agreement was found with the analytical results, obtained using a homogenisation approach. We find that the formation of tactoids significantly increases antibiotic diffusion times leading to stronger antibiotic resistance.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn humans, the nc886 locus is a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele. Periconceptional conditions have an effect on the methylation status of nc886, and further, this methylation status is associated with health outcomes in later life, in line with the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis. Animal models would offer opportunities to study the associations between periconceptional conditions, nc886 methylation status and metabolic phenotypes further. Thus, we set out to investigate the methylation pattern of the nc886 locus in non-human mammals.\n\nDataWe obtained DNA methylation data from the data repository GEO for mammals, whose nc886 gene included all three major parts of nc886 and had sequency similarity of over 80% with the human nc886. Our final sample set consisted of DNA methylation data from humans, chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, orangutangs, baboons, macaques, vervets, marmosets and guinea pigs.\n\nResultsIn human data sets the methylation pattern of nc886 locus followed the expected bimodal distribution, indicative of polymorphic imprinting. In great apes, we identified a unimodal DNA methylation pattern with 50% methylation level in all individuals and in all subspecies. In Old World monkeys, the between individual variation was greater and methylation on average was close to 60%. In guinea pigs the region around the nc886 homologue was non-methylated. Results obtained from the sequence comparison of the CTCF binding sites flanking the nc886 gene support the results on the DNA methylation data.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that unlike in humans, nc886 is not a polymorphically imprinted metastable epiallele in non-human primates or in guinea pigs, thus implying that animal models are not applicable for nc886 research. The obtained data suggests that the nc886 region may be classically imprinted in great apes, and potentially also in Old World monkeys, but not in guinea pigs.",

    "abstract": "The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the dorsomedial striatum (dmStr) are linked to working memory (WM) but how striatum-projecting mPFC neurons contribute to WM encoding, maintenance, or retrieval remains unclear. Here, we probed mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr pathway function in freely-moving mice during a T-maze alternation test of spatial WM. Fiber photometry of GCaMP6m-labeled mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr projection neurons revealed strongest activity during the delay period that requires WM maintenance. Demonstrating causality, optogenetic inhibition of mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr neurons only during the delay period impaired performance. Conversely, enhancing mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr pathway activity--via pharmacological suppression of HCN1 or by optogenetic activation during the delay-- alleviated WM impairment induced by NMDA receptor blockade. Consistently, cellular-resolution miniscope imaging resolved preferred activation of >50% mPFC[-&gt;]dmStr neurons during WM maintenance. This subpopulation was distinct from neurons showing preference for encoding and retrieval. In all periods, including the delay, neuronal sequences were evident. Striatum-projecting mPFC neurons thus critically contribute to spatial WM maintenance.",
