    "abstract": "1Knowledge of speech and music depends upon the ability to perceive relationships between sounds in order to form a stable mental representation of statistical structure. Although evidence exists for the learning of musical scale structure from the statistical properties of sound events, little research has been able to observe how specific acoustic features contribute to statistical learning independent of the effects of long-term exposure. Here, using a new musical system, we show that spectral content is an important cue for acquiring musical scale structure. In two experiments, participants completed probe-tone ratings before and after a half-hour period of exposure to melodies in a novel musical scale with a predefined statistical structure. In Experiment 1, participants were randomly assigned to either a no-exposure control group, or to exposure groups who heard pure tone or complex tone sequences. In Experiment 2, participants were randomly assigned to exposure groups who heard complex tones constructed with odd harmonics or even harmonics. Learning outcome was assessed by correlating pre/post-exposure ratings and the statistical structure of tones within the exposure period. Spectral information significantly affected sensitivity to statistical structure: participants were able to learn after exposure to all tested timbres, but did best at learning with timbres with odd harmonics, which were congruent with scale structure. Results show that spectral amplitude distribution is a useful cue for statistical learning, and suggest that musical scale structure might be acquired through exposure to spectral distribution in sounds.",

    "abstract": "Soluble ACE2 (sACE2) decoy receptors are promising agents to inhibit SARS-CoV-2, as their efficiency is less likely to be affected by common escape mutations in viral proteins. However, their success may be limited by their relatively poor potency. To address this challenge, we developed a large decoy library of sACE2 fusion proteins, generated with several protease inhibitors or multimerization tags. Among these decoys, multimeric sACE2 consisting of SunTag or MoonTag systems, which were originally utilized for signal amplification or gene activation systems, were extremely effective in neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 in pseudoviral systems and in clinical isolates. These novel sACE2 fusion proteins exhibited greater than 100-fold SARS-CoV-2 neutralization efficiency, compared to monomeric sACE2. SunTag or MoonTag in combination with a more potent version of sACE2, which has multiple point mutations for greater binding (v1), achieved near complete neutralization at a sub-nanomolar range, comparable with clinical monoclonal antibodies. Pseudoviruses bearing mutant versions of Spike, alpha, beta, gamma or delta variants, were also neutralized efficiently with SunTag or MoonTag fused sACE2(v1). Finally, therapeutic treatment of sACE2(v1)-MoonTag provided protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in an in vivo mouse model. Overall, we suggest that the superior activity of the sACE2-SunTag or sACE2-MoonTag fusions is due to the greater occupancy of the multimeric sACE2 receptors on Spike protein as compared to monomeric sACE2. Therefore, these highly potent multimeric sACE2 decoy receptors may offer a promising treatment approach against SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryMultimerization of sACE2 markedly enhanced the neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 by blocking multiple viral spike proteins simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "With the advancement of human stem cell cultures and interest in understanding human embryogenesis, human blastocyst-like structures, or human blastoids, are being developed. Thus far, two different strategies have been taken, generating blastoids from naive human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC)1-3 or through reprogramming of adult human somatic cells4. All these studies utilize comparative transcriptome analyses to authenticate blastoid cells and identify their counterparts in the human blastocyst5,6. However, the validity of comparative transcriptome analysis is critically hinged on including relevant reference data, not only those from targeted cell types but also from potential alternative cell lineages. Thus, we sought to reevaluate the single-cell transcriptome data from the blastoids based on a more comprehensive cellular reference, which includes data from in vitro cultured human6,7, non-human primate (NHP, Cynomolgus macaque) blastocysts8, a human stem cell-based post-implantation amniotic sac embryoid (PASE) model9, and an in vivo gastrulation-stage human embryo specimen10, using four different analysis strategies. Our analyses unequivocally support that blastoids developed by reprogramming adult human somatic cells largely fail to generate cells with a transcriptome profile consistent with the human blastocyst trophectoderm. Instead, cells identified as trophectoderm-like have a transcriptional profile more similar to the amniotic ectoderm in the gastrulating human and NHP embryos. To facilitate cell lineage identifications in human embryo models, we further identified a set of human amniotic ectoderm and trophectoderm markers that could be utilized to distinguish these two lineages. We further built a neural-network based online prediction tool, which accurately discerns the full cellular composition of blastoids.",

    "abstract": "The density functional theory framework and the scaling theory are employed to approach the problem of the Polyelectrolyte brush bilayer under shear. It turns out that, the system at shear rates larger than a critical shear rate undergo a global restructuring during which chains stretch in the shear direction. In the absence of the electrostatic interactions as well as the hydrodynamic interactions, this global restructuring causes a sublinear scaling of the shear stress with the shear rate which makes the shear thinning effect. Nevertheless, in the presence of the hydrodynamic interactions, not only there is no sublinear regime but also a weak superlinear regime which makes a weak shear thickening effect. In the presence of the electrostatic interactions, the stress tensor components change by their second Virial coefficients, however, their shear rate power law are untouched. Nonetheless, the kinetic friction coefficient is independent of the electrostatic interactions. This suggests that the lubrication is not very much different than the neutral bilayers and the electrostatic interactions do not change that. The results of this study offers that maybe nature uses another mechanism to reduce friction coefficient in synovial joint and other biological systems.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEThe significance of this study is that it strongly criticizes the theoretical approach to the same system which is already published (T. Kreer, Soft Matter, 12, 3479 (2016)). Moreover, the results of this study may help our understanding from Biological systems and optimization of artificial synovial joint which is the core of this study.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundOrthosiphon stamineus Benth. was a dietary supplement or a traditional folk herb with widespread clinical application, but it was lack of comprehensive understanding of its active ingredients and polypharmacological mechanisms. The aim of this work was to systematically study its natural compounds and the molecular mechanisms of the O. stamineus via network pharmacology.\n\nMethodsCompounds from O. stamineus were collected by literature retrieval and evaluated by SwissADME with the physicochemical property (ADMET model) and the likelihood for a natural medicine. The connection of active ingredients and target genes was built and confirmed by Cytoscape and AutoDock vina. Then, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were separately performed to obtain a more in-depth understanding of O. stamineus. Finally, the relationship among active ingredients, targets, and diseases was built to clarify the polypharmacological mechanisms and found relevant active substances for further drug discovery.\n\nResultsA total of 159 compounds of O. stamineus were collected, and 22 potentially active ingredients were screened out. The Ingredient-Target Interaction Network was built with 12 flavonoids, 3 diterpenes, 3 phenols, and 4 volatile oils, and 65 targets. The Docking analysis indicated that the ingredient-target interaction network was reliable; most ligand-receptor had a strong binding affinity (lowest binding energy: -6.9 kcal/mol). After pathway analysis, 185 significant biological processes and 36 signal pathways were found, and the ingredient-target-disease network of O. stamineus was constructed for polypharmacological mechanisms.\n\nConclusionOur study clarified the polypharmacological mechanisms via the relationship among active ingredients, targets, and diseases and provided better guidance for subsequent experiments and potential active ingredients for drug discovery or health promotion.",

    "abstract": "Upon sensing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), eukaryotic cells either die or repair DSBs via one of two competing pathways, i.e., non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR). We show that cell fate after DNA damage hinges on the guanine nucleotide-exchange modulator of heterotrimeric G-protein, Gi*{beta}{gamma}, GIV/Girdin. GIV suppresses HR by binding and sequestering BRCA1, a key coordinator of multiple steps within the HR pathway, away from DSBs; it does so using a C-terminal motif that binds BRCA1s BRCT-modules via both phospho-dependent and -independent mechanisms. GIV promotes NHEJ, and binds and activates Gi and enhances the  free G{beta}{gamma}[-&gt;]PI-3-kinase[-&gt;]Akt pathway, thus revealing the enigmatic origin of prosurvival Akt signals during dsDNA repair. Absence of GIV, or the loss of either of its two functions impaired DNA repair, and induced cell death when challenged with numerous cytotoxic agents. That GIV selectively binds few other BRCT-containing proteins suggests convergent signaling such that heterotrimeric G-proteins may finetune sensing, repair, and outcome after DNA damage.\n\nGRAPHIC ABSTRACT\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=190 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/452842v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (66K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@3d5202org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d32d89org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@152a85dorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ab9953_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG HIGHLIGHTSO_LINon-receptor G protein modulator, GIV/Girdin binds BRCA1\nC_LIO_LIBinding occurs in both canonical and non-canonical modes\nC_LIO_LIGIV sequesters BRCA1 away from dsDNA breaks, suppresses HR\nC_LIO_LIActivation of Gi by GIV enhances Akt signals, favors NHEJ\nC_LI\n\nIN BRIEFIn this work, the authors show that heterotrimeric G protein signaling that is triggered by non-receptor GEF, GIV/Girdin, in response to double-stranded DNA breaks is critical for decisive signaling events which favor non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and inhibit homologous recombination (HR).",

    "abstract": "The question of how cell-to-cell differences in transcription rate affect RNA count distributions is fundamental for understanding biological processes underlying transcription. We argue that answering this question requires quantitative models that are both interpretable (describing concrete biophysical phenomena) and tractable (amenable to mathematical analysis). This enables the identification of experiments which best discriminate between competing hypotheses. As a proof of principle, we introduce a simple but flexible class of models involving a stochastic transcription rate coupled to a discrete stochastic RNA transcription and splicing process, and compare and contrast two biologically plausible hypotheses about transcription rate variation. One assumes variation is due to DNA experiencing mechanical strain, while the other assumes it is due to regulator number fluctuations. Although biophysically distinct, these models are mathematically similar, and we show they are hard to distinguish without comparing whole predicted probability distributions. Our work illustrates the importance of theory-guided data collection, and introduces a general framework for constructing and solving mathematically nontrivial continuous-discrete stochastic models.\n\nSignificance StatementThe interpretation of transcriptomic observations requires detailed models of biophysical noise that can be compared and fit to experimental data. Models of intrinsic noise, describing stochasticity in molecular reactions, and extrinsic noise, describing cell-to-cell variation, are particularly common. However, integrating and solving them is challenging, and previous results are largely limited to summary statistics. We examine two mechanistically grounded stochastic models of transcriptional variation and demonstrate that (1) well-known regimes naturally emerge in limiting cases, and (2) the choice of noise model significantly affects the RNA distributions, but not the lower moments, offering a route to model identification and inference. This approach provides a simple and biophysically interpretable means to construct and unify models of transcriptional variation.",

In contrast, we observe that the APOBEC-induced mutational density is positively associated with APOBEC activity in inverted repeats (cruciform structures), where the impact of cytosine at the 3-end of the hairpin loop is substantial. Surprisingly, the APOBEC-signature mutation density per TC motif in the single-stranded DNA of a G-quadruplex (G4) is lower than in the four-stranded part of G4 and in B-DNA.

Etiologies of ARDS are multifaceted such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis or as recently the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Antifibrotic drugs may be a better approach to slow the fibrotic process but they often have poor efficacy in patients, and the mortality rate remains high, up to 40% within 5 years of diagnosis.\n\nHere, we tested the antifibrotic effect of a ReGeneTaring Agents named OTR4120 in a bleomycin-induced mouse model of pulmonary fibrosis.\n\nMethodsSwiss mice were randomly divided into four experimental groups: saline-treated control group, an OTR4120 group, a bleomycin-induced fibrosis group without OTR4120, and a bleomycin-induced fibrosis groups with OTR4120 (intravenous injections every 3 days starting at day 11 post bleomycin I.P. injection). Lungs were compared using the lung/body weight index, and the extend of interstitial injury area was graded using histopathological assessment of haematoxylin & eosin-stained lung tissue sections. Lung tissue Collagen I and Collagen III levels, and blood cytokine levels were measured using a Collagen colorimetric kit and a Cytokine colorimetric kit, respectively.\n\nResultsThe group treated by OTR4120 alone were used as a control. The clincal signs in all animals resoved gradually on day 17 after bleomycin injections and 6 days after OTR4120 treatment, and disappeared almost completetly at day 24 after bleomycin injections and day 13 after OTR4120 treatment. Lung/body weight index values were significantly lower in the bleomycin-OTR4120 treated group versus the bleomycin group (7.31, 9.97 and 7.63 mg/g, p-value< 0.01; respectively). Histopathological analyses suggest that OTR4120 treatment ameliorated the increased inflammatory cell infiltration, and attenuated the reduction in interstitial thickening, associated with bleomycin-induced fibrosis. Collagen III and cytokine levels were decreased in the OTR4120 group versus the fibrotic (bleomycin only) group. OTR4120-treated animals were less affected in their behavior, did not loose weight nor appetite, and recovered overall activities within 6 days of OTR4120 treatment, while none of the vehicle-treated animals recovered to normal.\n\nConclusionOTR4120 is a potential candidate to reduce lung fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIn the aftermath of Covid-19, some patients develop a fibrotic lung disease, i.e., post-COVID-19 lung disease (PCLD), for which we currently lack insights into pathogenesis, disease models, or treatment options.\n\nMethodUsing an AI-guided approach, we analyzed > 1000 human lung transcriptomic datasets associated with various lung conditions using two viral pandemic signatures (ViP and sViP) and one covid lung-derived signature. Upon identifying similarities between COVID-19 and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), we subsequently dissected the basis for such similarity from molecular, cytopathic, and immunologic perspectives using a panel of IPF-specific gene signatures, alongside signatures of alveolar type II (AT2) cytopathies and of prognostic monocyte-driven processes that are known drivers of IPF. Transcriptome-derived findings were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to identify the major triggers of AT2 dysfunction. Key findings were validated in hamster and human adult lung organoid (ALO) pre-clinical models of COVID-19 using immunohistochemistry and qPCR.\n\nFindingsCOVID-19 resembles IPF at a fundamental level; it recapitulates the gene expression patterns (ViP and IPF signatures), cytokine storm (IL15-centric), and the AT2 cytopathic changes, e.g., injury, DNA damage, arrest in a transient, damage-induced progenitor state, and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). These immunocytopathic features were induced in pre-clinical COVID models (ALO and hamster) and reversed with effective anti-CoV-2 therapeutics in hamsters. PPI-network analyses pinpointed ER stress as one of the shared early triggers of both diseases, and IHC studies validated the same in the lungs of deceased subjects with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-challenged hamster lungs. Lungs from tg-mice, in which ER stress is induced specifically in the AT2 cells, faithfully recapitulate the host immune response and alveolar cytopathic changes that are induced by SARS-CoV-2.\n\nInterpretationLike IPF, COVID-19 may be driven by injury-induced ER stress that culminates into progenitor state arrest and SASP in AT2 cells. The ViP signatures in monocytes may be key determinants of prognosis. The insights, signatures, disease models identified here are likely to spur the development of therapies for patients with IPF and other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the National Institutes for Health grants R01-GM138385 and AI155696 and funding from the Tobacco-Related disease Research Program (R01RG3780).\n\nOne Sentence SummarySevere COVID-19 triggers cellular processes seen in fibrosing Interstitial Lung Disease\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSIn its aftermath, the COVID-19 pandemic has left many survivors, almost a third of those who recovered, with a mysterious long-haul form of the disease which culminates in a fibrotic form of interstitial lung disease (post-COVID-19 ILD). Post-COVID-19 ILD remains a largely unknown entity. Currently, we lack insights into the core cytopathic features that drive this condition.\n\nAdded value of this studyUsing an AI-guided approach, which involves the use of sets of gene signatures, protein-protein network analysis, and a hamster model of COVID-19, we have revealed here that COVID-19 -lung fibrosis resembles IPF, the most common form of ILD, at a fundamental level--showing similar gene expression patterns in the lungs and blood, and dysfunctional AT2 processes (ER stress, telomere instability, progenitor cell arrest, and senescence). These findings are insightful because AT2 cells are known to contain an elegant quality control network to respond to intrinsic or extrinsic stress; a failure of such quality control results in diverse cellular phenotypes, of which ER stress appears to be a point of convergence, which appears to be sufficient to drive downstream fibrotic remodeling in the lung.\n\nImplications of all the available evidenceBecause unbiased computational methods identified the shared fundamental aspects of gene expression and cellular processes between COVID-19 and IPF, the impact of our findings is likely to go beyond COVID-19 or any viral pandemic. The insights, tools (disease models, gene signatures, and biomarkers), and mechanisms identified here are likely to spur the development of therapies for patients with IPF and, other fibrotic interstitial lung diseases, all of whom have limited or no treatment options. To dissect the validated prognostic biomarkers to assess and track the risk of pulmonary fibrosis and develop therapeutics to halt fibrogenic progression.",

    "abstract": "The demand for genetic testing for breast cancer susceptibility genes is increasing for both breast cancer patients and healthy individuals. Here we established a novel high-throughput assay to detect germline pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes. In general, up 10 to 50 individual genomic DNA samples were mixed together to create a mixed DNA sample and the mixed DNA sample was subjected to a next-generation multigene panel. Germline pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes could be found in the mixed DNA sample; next, site-specific Sanger sequencing was performed to identify individuals who carried he pathogenic variant in the mixed samples. We found that the recall and precision rates were 89.9% and 92.9% when twenty individual genomic samples were mixed. Therefore, our new assay can increase an approximately 20-fold of efficacy to identify the pathogenic variants in breast cancer susceptibility genes in individuals when compared with current assay.",

Here we use genetic code expansion to demonstrate that phosphorylation of SARS-CoV-2 N at either of two pseudo-repeats centered at Ser197 and Thr205 is sufficient for 14-3-3 binding. According to fluorescence anisotropy, the pT205-motif, present in SARS-CoV-2 but not in SARS-CoV, is preferred over the pS197-motif by all seven human 14-3-3 isoforms, which display unforeseen pT205/pS197 binding selectivity hierarchy. Crystal structures demonstrate that pS197 and pT205 are mutually exclusive 14-3-3-binding sites, whereas SAXS and biochemical data indicate 14-3-3 binding occludes the Ser/Arg-rich region, inhibiting its dephosphorylation. This Ser/Arg-rich region of N is highly prone to mutations, as exemplified by the Omicron and Delta variants, with our data suggesting how the strength of its 14-3-3 binding can be linked with the replicative fitness of the virus.",

    "abstract": "Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptor (GDNF Family Receptor 1 - GFR1) are well known to mediate spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) proliferation and survival in the mammalian testes. In nonmammalian species, Gdnf and Gfr1 orthologs have been found but their functions remain poorly investigated in the testis. Considering this background, this study aimed to understand the roles of Gdnf-Gfr1 signaling pathway in the zebrafish testis by combining in vivo, in silico and ex vivo approaches. Our analysis showed that zebrafish exhibited two paralogs of Gndf (gdnfa and gdnfb) and its receptor, Gfr1 (gfr1a and gfr1b), in agreement with the teleost-specific third round (3R) of whole genome duplication. Expression analysis further revealed that gdnfa and gfr1a were the most expressed copies in the zebrafish adult testes. Subsequently, we demonstrated that gdnfa is expressed in the germ cells, while Gfr1a was detected in early spermatogonia (mainly in types Aund and Adiff) and Sertoli cells. Functional ex vivo analysis showed that Gdnf promoted the creation of new available niches by stimulating proliferation of both type Aund spermatogonia and their surrounding Sertoli cells, but without changing pou5f3 mRNA levels. Strikingly, Gdnf also inhibited late spermatogonial differentiation as shown by the decrease of type B spermatogonia and down-regulation of dazl in the co-treatment with Fsh. Altogether, our data revealed for the first time that a germ cell-derived factor is associated with maintaining germ cell stemness through the creation of new available niches, supporting development of differentiating spermatogonial cysts and inhibiting late spermatogonial differentiation in autocrine and paracrine manners.",

    "abstract": "PurposeThe cone-dominant, 13-lined ground squirrel (13-LGS) retina mimics the human foveal region but retinal development in this useful rodent species has not been reported. Here, the embryonic and postnatal development of the 13-LGS retina was studied to further characterize the species as a practical alternative animal model for investigating cone-based vision in health and disease.\n\nMethodsThe spatiotemporal expression of key progenitor and cell type markers was examined in retinas from defined embryonic and postnatal stages using immunohistochemistry. Changes in the postnatal gene expression were also assessed by qPCR.\n\nResultsThe 13-LGS neuroblastic layer expressed key progenitor markers (Sox2, Vsx2, Pax6, and Lhx2) at E18. Sequential cell fate determination evidenced by the first appearance of cell type-specific marker labeling was: at E18, ganglion cells (Brn-3A, HuC/D) and microglia (Iba1); at E24-25.5 shortly before birth, photoreceptor progenitor (Otx2, Recoverin), horizontal and amacrine cells (Lhx1, Oc1); and at P15, bipolar cells (Vsx1, CaBP5) and Muller glia cells (GS, Rlbp1). Photoreceptor maturation indicated by opsin+ outer segments and PNA labeling of cone sheaths was completed at the time of eye opening, P21-24.\n\nConclusionsThe timeline and order of retinal cell development in the 13-LGS generally matches that recorded from other mammalian models but with a stark variation in the proportion of various cell types due to cone-dense photoreceptors. This provides a baseline for future examinations of developmental, disease model, and stem cell approach studies employing this emerging rodent model of human vision.",

    "abstract": "The nuclear factor one (NFI) transcription factors play key roles in regulating the onset of both neuronal and glial differentiation during cortical development. Reduced NFI expression results in delayed differentiation, which is associated with neurodevelopmental disorders in humans that include intellectual disability, agenesis of the corpus callosum and macrocephaly. Despite their importance, our understanding of how individual NFI family members are regulated during cortical development remains limited. Here, we demonstrate that in mice, the homeobox transcription factor EMX2 regulates Nfib expression in radial glial cells during cortical development. Using a combination of bioinformatics, molecular and histological approaches, we demonstrate that EMX2 is able to bind to the Nfib promoter to up-regulate Nfib expression. Unexpectedly, in vivo over-expression of EMX2 in wildtype animals does not further up-regulate NFIB but instead leads to its down-regulation. Therefore, our findings suggest that EMX2 is capable of both activating and repressing Nfib, in a context-dependent manner. This bi-directional control over Nfib expression enables fine-tuning of the total level of NFI proteins expressed and could be important for cell-type specific NFI functions.",

Here we characterize the function of the SPI-22 T6SS of S. bongori, showing that it has antibacterial activity. We identify a group of antibacterial T6SS effectors (TseV1-4) containing an N-terminal PAAR-like domain and a C-terminal VRR-Nuc domain encoded next to cognate immunity proteins that contain the DUF3396 domain (TsiV1-4). TseV2 and TseV3 are toxic when expressed in Escherichia coli and bacterial competition assays confirm that TseV2 and TseV3 are secreted by the SPI-22 T6SS. Phylogenetic analysis reveals that TseV1-4 are evolutionarily related to enzymes involved in DNA repair. TseV2 and TseV3 maintained the ability to bind DNA, but instead cause specific DNA double-strand breaks and induce the SOS response in target cells. The crystal structure of the TseV3:TsiV3 complex reveals that the immunity protein likely blocks the effector interaction with the DNA substrate. These results expand our knowledge on the function of Salmonella pathogenicity islands, the evolution of toxins used in biological conflicts, and the endogenous mechanism regulating the activity of these toxins.",

    "abstract": "Oxygen passes along the ramifying branches of the lungs bronchial tree and enters the blood through millions of tiny, thin-walled gas exchange sacs called alveoli. Classical histological studies have suggested that alveoli arise late in development by a septation process that subdivides large air sacs into smaller compartments. Although a critical role has been proposed for contractile myofibroblasts, the mechanism of alveolar patterning and morphogenesis is not well understood. Here we present the three-dimensional cellular structure of alveoli, and show using single-cell labeling and deep imaging that an alveolus in the mouse lung is composed of just 2 epithelial cells and a total of a dozen cells of 7 different types, each with a remarkable, distinctive structure. By mapping alveolar development at cellular resolution at a specific position in the branch lineage, we find that alveoli form surprisingly early by direct budding of epithelial cells out from the airway stalk between enwrapping smooth muscle cells that rearrange into a ring of 3-5 myofibroblasts at the alveolar base. These alveolar entrance myofibroblasts are anatomically and developmentally distinct from myofibroblasts that form the thin fiber partitions of alveolar complexes ( partitioning myofibroblasts). The nascent alveolar bud is led by a single alveolar type 2 (AT2) cell following selection from epithelial progenitors; a lateral inhibitory signal transduced by Notch ensures selection of only one cell so its trailing neighbor acquires AT1 fate and flattens into the cup-shaped wall of the alveolus. Our analysis suggests an elegant new model of alveolar patterning and formation that provides the foundation for understanding the cellular and molecular basis of alveolar diseases and regeneration.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe report a direct budding mechanism of alveolar development distinct from the classical model of subdivision ( septation) of large air sacs.",

    "abstract": "Spatial transcriptomics enables spatially resolved gene expression measurements at near single-cell resolution. There is a pressing need for computational tools to enable the detection of genes that are differentially expressed (DE) within specific cell types across tissue context. We show that current approaches cannot learn cell type-specific DE due to changes in cell type composition across space and the fact that measurement units often detect transcripts from more than one cell type. Here, we introduce a statistical method, Cell type-Specific Inference of Differential Expression (C-SIDE), that identifies cell type-specific patterns of differential gene expression while accounting for localization of other cell types. We model spatial transcriptomics gene expression as an additive mixture across cell types of general log-linear cell type-specific expression functions. This approach provides a unified framework for defining and identifying gene expression changes in a wide-range of relevant contexts: changes due to pathology, anatomical regions, physical proximity to specific cell types, and cellular microenvironment. Furthermore, our approach enables statistical inference across multiple samples and replicates when such data is available. We demonstrate, through simulations and validation experiments on Slide-seq and MER-FISH datasets, that our approach accurately identifies cell type-specific differential gene expression and provides valid uncertainty quantification. Lastly, we apply our method to characterize spatially-localized tissue changes in the context of disease. In an Alzheimers mouse model Slide-seq dataset, we identify plaque-dependent patterns of cellular immune activity. We also find a putative interaction between tumor cells and myeloid immune cells in a Slide-seq tumor dataset. We make our C-SIDE method publicly available as part of the open source R package https://github.com/dmcable/spacexr.",

    "abstract": "A substantial number of Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) studies have aimed to describe the evolution of singlet excited states leading to the formation of photo-activated form, OCPR. The most recent one suggests that three picosecond-lived excited states are formed after the sub-100 fs decay of the initial S2 state. The S* state which has the longest reported lifetime of a few to tens of picoseconds is considered to be the precursor of the first red photoproduct P1. Here, we report the ultrafast photo-dynamics of the OCP from Synechocystis PCC 6803, carried out using Visible-NIR femtosecond time-resolved absorption spectroscopy as a function of the excitation pulse power and wavelength. We found that a carotenoid radical cation can form even at relatively low excitation power, obscuring the determination of photo-activation yields for P1. Moreover, the comparison of green (540 nm) and blue (470 nm) excitations revealed the existence of an hitherto uncharacterized excited state, denoted as S[~], living a few tens of picoseconds and formed only upon 470 nm excitation. Since neither the P1 quantum yield nor the photo-activation speed over hundreds of seconds vary under green and blue continuous irradiation, this S[~] species is unlikely to be involved in the photo-activation mechanism leading to OCPR. We also addressed the effect of His-tagging at the N- or C-termini on excited state photo-physical properties. Differences in spectral signatures and lifetimes of the different excited states were observed, at variance with the usual assumption that His-tagging hardly influences protein dynamics and function. Altogether our results advocate for careful consideration of the excitation power and His-tag position when comparing the photo-activation of different OCP variants, and beg to revisit the notion that S* is the precursor of photoactivated OCPR.\n\nTOC\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=166 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/474187v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1064473org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@77e3c7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10b1e0eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e24977_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

The transmissible cancers in dogs and devils are known to spread through direct physical contact, but the exact route of transmission of bivalve transmissible neoplasia (BTN) has not yet been confirmed. It has been hypothesized that cancer cells could be released by diseased animals and spread through the water column to infect/engraft into other animals. To test the feasibility of this proposed mechanism of transmission, we tested the ability of BTN cells from the soft-shell clam (Mya arenaria BTN, or MarBTN) to survive in artificial seawater. We found that BTN cells are highly sensitive to salinity, with acute toxicity at salinity levels lower than those found in their environment. BTN cells also survive longer at lower temperatures, with >48% of cells surviving a week in seawater at temperatures from 4{degrees}C to 16{degrees}C, and 49% surviving for more than two weeks at 4{degrees}C. With one clam donor, living cells were observed for more than eight weeks at 4{degrees}C. We also used qPCR of environmental DNA (eDNA) to detect the presence of BTN-specific DNA in the environment. We observed release of BTN-specific DNA into the water of aquaria from tanks with highly BTN-positive clams, and we detected BTN-specific DNA in seawater samples collected from BTN-endemic areas, although the level detected was much lower. Overall, these data show that BTN cells can survive well in seawater, and they are released into the water by diseased animals, supporting the hypothesis that BTN is spread from animal-to-animal by cells through seawater.",

    "abstract": "Agonistic CD40 therapy has shown to inhibit cancer progression, but only in a fraction of patients. Hence, understanding the cancer cell-intrinsic and microenvironmental determinants of CD40 therapy response is crucial to identify responsive patient populations and design efficient combination treatments. Here, we showed that the therapeutic efficacy of CD40 in responder melanoma tumours, relied on pre-existing cDC1-primed CD8+ T cells, however cDC1s were dispensable after CD40 administration. Surprisingly, in response to CD40 the abundance of activated cDCs, potentially derived from cDC2s increased, thereby further activating antitumour CD8+ T cells. Hence, distinct cDC subsets are required to induce CD40 responses. By contrast, lung tumours, characterised by a high abundance of macrophages, were resistant to CD40 therapy. Combining CD40 therapy with macrophage depletion led to tumour growth inhibition only in the presence of strong neoantigens. Accordingly, treatment with immunogenic cell-death inducing chemotherapy sensitised non-immunogenic tumours to CD40 therapy.",

    "abstract": "To what extent is the size of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) response influenced by factors other than neural activity? In a re-analysis of three neuroimaging datasets (male and female human participants), we find large systematic inhomogeneities in the BOLD response magnitude in primary visual cortex (V1): stimulus-evoked BOLD responses, expressed in units of percent signal change, are up to 50% larger along the representation of the horizontal meridian than the vertical meridian. To assess whether this surprising effect can be interpreted as differences in local neural activity, we quantified several factors that potentially contribute to the size of the BOLD response. We find relationships between BOLD response magnitude and cortical thickness, curvature, depth and macrovasculature. These relationships are consistently found across subjects and datasets and suggest that variation in BOLD response magnitudes across cortical locations reflects, in part, differences in anatomy and vascularization. To compensate for these factors, we implement a regression-based correction method and show that after correction, BOLD responses become more homogeneous across V1. The correction reduces the horizontal/vertical difference by about half, indicating that some of the difference is likely not due to neural activity differences. We conclude that interpretation of variation in BOLD response magnitude across cortical locations should consider the influence of the potential confounding factors of thickness, curvature, depth and vascularization.\n\nSignificance statementThe magnitude of the BOLD signal is often used as a surrogate of neural activity, but the exact factors that contribute to its strength have not been studied on a voxel-wise level. Here, we examined several anatomical and measurement-related factors to assess their relationship with BOLD signal magnitude. We find that BOLD magnitude correlates with cortical anatomy, depth and macrovasculature. To remove the contribution of these factors, we propose a simple, data-driven correction method that can be used in any functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. After accounting for the confounding factors, BOLD magnitude becomes more spatially homogenous. Our correction method improves the ability to make more accurate inferences about local neural activity from fMRI data.",

    "abstract": "In this study, for the first time we investigated Cr(III) and Cr(VI) stress-induced physiological and biochemical responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. The capacity of A. thalian to accumulate Cr is closely related to the valence of chromium. Cr(VI) was more toxic than Cr(III) as indicated by chromium accumulation and growth inhibition. When the concentration of chromium is greater than 200M, the root length and biomass of A. thaliana are reduced. But interestingly, Cr(III) at 200M increased the root length and biomass of A. thaliana compared to the control. The transmission electron microscope shows that Cr(VI) can cause the chloroplasts damaged and the chlorophyll reduced more than Cr(III). The chloroplasts were filled the starch grains. An increase of lipid peroxidation in A. thaliana roots caused by Cr was measured, and this effect increases as the increasing Cr. It indicated that A. thaliana suffers from Cr-induced oxidative stress which resulted cell death in roots. To fight against oxidative stress, Ascorbate peroxidase and Glutathione reductase were activated by Cr in antioxidant defense. The inhibition of growth, the accumulation of chromium, the responses of antioxidant systems, and the ultra-morphological changes indicate that Cr(VI) was more toxic than Cr(III).",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe flow of physiologic fluids through organs and organs systems is an integral component of their function. The complex fluid dynamics in many organ systems are still not completely understood, and in-vivo measurements of flow rates and pressure provide a testament to the complexity of each flow system. Variability in in-vivo measurements and the lack of control over flow characteristics leave a lot to be desired for testing and evaluation of current modes of treatments as well as future innovations. In-vitro models are particularly ideal for studying neurological conditions such as hydrocephalus due to their complex pathophysiology and interactions with therapeutic measures. The following aims to present the reciprocating positive displacement pump, capable of inducing pulsating flow of a defined volume at a controlled beat rate and amplitude. While the other fluidic applications of the pump are currently under investigation, this study was focused on simulating the pulsating cerebrospinal fluid production across profiles with varying parameters.\n\nMethodsPumps were manufactured using 3D printed and injection molded parts. The pumps were powered by an Arduino-based board and proprietary software that controls the linear motion of the pumps to achieve the specified output rate at the desired pulsation rate and amplitude. A range of [Formula] to [Formula] was tested to evaluate the versatility of the pumps. The accuracy and precision of the pumps output were evaluated by obtaining a total of 150 one-minute weight measurements of degassed deionized water per output rate across 15 pump channels. In addition, nine experiments were performed to evaluate the pumps control over pulsation rate and amplitude.\n\nResultsvolumetric analysis of a total of 1200 readings determined that the pumps achieved the target output volume rate with a mean absolute error of -0.001034283 [Formula] across the specified domain. It was also determined that the pumps can maintain pulsatile flow at a user-specified beat rate and amplitude.\n\nConclusionThe validation of this reciprocating positive displacement pump system allows for the future validation of novel designs to components used to treat hydrocephalus and other physiologic models involving pulsatile flow. Based on the promising results of these experiments at simulating pulsatile CSF flow, a benchtop model of human CSF production and distribution could be achieved through the incorporation of a chamber system and a compliance component.",

    "abstract": "Homeostasis plays a central role in our understanding how cells and organisms are able to oppose environmental disturbances and thereby maintain an internal stability. During the last two decades there has been an increased interest in using control engineering methods, especially integral control, in the analysis and design of homeostatic networks. Several reaction kinetic mechanisms have been discovered which lead to integral control. In two of them integral control is achieved, either by the removal of a single control species E by zero-order kinetics (\"single-E controllers\"), or by the removal of two control species by second-order kinetics (\"antithetic or dual-E control\"). In this paper we show results when the control species E1 and E2 in antithetic control are removed enzymatically by ping-pong or ternary-complex mechanisms. Our findings show that enzyme-catalyzed dual-E controllers can work in two control modes. In one mode, one of the two control species is active, but requires zero-order kinetics in its removal. In the other mode, both controller species are active and both are removed enzymatically. Conditions for the two control modes are put forward and biochemical examples with the structure of enzyme-catalyzed dual-E controllers are discussed.",

Pantala sp. had a proximate protein content of 445.14{+/-}0.04 %, a fat content of 4.93{+/-}0.05 %, an ash content of 5.24{+/-}0.03 %, a moisture content of 35.11{+/-}0.09 %, and a total carbohydrate content of 9.60{+/-}0.11 %. Total energy was 263.25{+/-}0.20 kcal/100 g, with fat energy accounting for 44.37{+/-}0.43 kcal/100 g. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) analysis revealed that this insect was high in phosphorus, iron, and copper for human consumption. In comparison to other edible insects studied, they were also excellent calcium sources. Agilent 7890B Gas Chromatograph (GC) analysis revealed that it contains 236.67 mg/100g of omega-3 and 523.32 mg/100g of omega-6. While the amino acids examined using High Performance liquid Chromatography contained all essential amino acids. ICP-OES was used to determine the levels of cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and arsenic (As). Pantala sp. had the highest concentration of As (average = 2.827 {+/-} 0.289 mg kg-1), followed by Cd (0.164 {+/-} 0.007 mg kg-1) and Pb (0.158 {+/-} 0.015 mg kg-1).

We established that infection with Omicron in naive Syrian hamsters resulted in a less severe disease than a comparable dose of prototype SARS-CoV-2 (Australia/VIC01/2020), with fewer clinical signs and less weight loss. We present data to show that these clinical observations were almost absent in convalescent hamsters challenged with the same dose of Omicron 50 days after an initial infection with Australia/VIC01/2020. The data provide evidence for immunity raised against prototype SARS-CoV-2 being protective against Omicron in the Syrian hamster model.

We here wanted to explore the infectivity of the omicron variant in comparison to the ancestral D614G strain. Strikingly, in hamsters that had been infected with the omicron variant, a 3 log10 lower viral RNA load was detected in the lungs as compared to animals infected with D614G and no infectious virus was detectable in this organ. Moreover, histopathological examination of the lungs from omicron-infecetd hamsters revealed no signs of peri-bronchial inflammation or bronchopneumonia.

Intraperitoneal route was used to overcome the restrictions imposed by injection of large volumes of viscous fluid in small and deranged blood vessels of mice with ECM. In the present study, a method of intravenous transfusion was implemented by injecting 200L of whole blood through the right jugular vein in mice with late-stage ECM, together with artemether given intraperitoneally, leading to a remarkable increase in survival, from 54% to 90%. On the contrary, mice receiving artemether plus plasma transfusion showed a worse outcome, with only 18% survival. Compared to the intraperitoneal route, intravascular transfusion led to faster and more pronounced recoveries of hematocrit, platelet counts, angiopoietins levels (ANG-1, ANG-2 and ANG-2/ANG-1) and blood brain barrier integrity.

    "abstract": "The Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis), an endangered species in decline due to multiple factors, including habitat loss, can be further threatened by climate change. Evaluating how climate shapes the population dynamics and distribution of the Karner blue (Kbb) is necessary for developing adaptive. Demographic models generally used for insect populations are often either density-dependent or applied to population presence-absence data in a density-independent manner. In contrast, we used scale-based, mixed density-dependent and density-independent (hereafter \"endo-exogenous\") models for the Kbb, based on long-term count data of abundance during flight periods, to understand how different environmental variables, including climate, affected Kbb extinction risk through the middle of the 21st century. Our endo-exogenous models showed that density-dependent and environmental variables, including climate, topography, and tree canopy coverage, were essential drivers of Kbb population dynamics. We also found that Kbbs response to climate differed between the species two annual generations and across its range: higher temperature and precipitation in summer generally benefited the second-generation populations, whereas there were uncertainties of the effects on the populations in different ecoregions during the first generation. These results imply that population-specific biotic/abiotic factors need to be incorporated into plans to manage the recovery of Kbb under climate change.",

    "abstract": "Weather and land use can significantly impact mosquito abundance and presence, and by consequence, mosquito-borne disease (MBD) dynamics. Knowledge of vector ecology and mosquito species response to these drivers will help us better predict risk from MBD. In this study, we evaluated and compared the independent and combined effects of weather and land use on mosquito species occurrence and abundance in Eastern Ontario, Canada. Data on occurrence and abundance (245,591 individuals) of 30 mosquito species were obtained from mosquito capture at 85 field sites in 2017 and 2018. Environmental variables were extracted from weather and land use datasets in a 1-km buffer around trapping sites. The relative importance of weather and land use on mosquito abundance (for common species) or occurrence (for all species) was evaluated using multivariate hierarchical statistical models. Models incorporating both weather and land use performed better than models that include weather only for approximately half of species (59% for occurrence model and 50% for abundance model). Mosquito occurrence was mainly associated with temperature whereas abundance was associated with precipitation and temperature combined. Land use was more often associated with abundance than occurrence. For most species, occurrence and abundance were positively associated with forest cover but for some there was a negative association. Occurrence and abundance of some species (47% for occurrence model and 88% for abundance model) were positively associated with wetlands, but negatively associated with urban (Culiseta melanura and Anopheles walkeri) and agriculture (An. quadrimaculatus, Cs. minnesotae and An. walkeri) environments. This study provides predictive relationships between weather, land use and mosquito occurrence and abundance for a wide range of species including those that are currently uncommon, yet known as arboviruses vectors. Elucidation of these relationships has the potential to contribute to better prediction of MBD risk, and thus more efficiently targeted prevention and control measures.",

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor receptors (TNFRs) regulate a diverse array of biological functions, including adaptive immunity, neurodevelopment, and many others. Although TNFRs are expressed in all metazoan phyla, a coherent model of the molecular origins of mammalian TNFRs--and how they relate to TNFRs in other phyla--has remained elusive. To address this, we executed a large-scale, systematic Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST)-based approach to trace the evolutionary ancestry of all 29 human TNFRs. We discovered that all human TNFRs are descendants of a single pre-bilaterian TNFR with strong sequence similarity to the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), which we designate as PITA for  p75NTR is the TNFR Ancestor. A distinct subset of human TNFRs--including EDAR, XEDAR and TROY--share a unique history as descendants of EDAR-XEDAR-TROY (EXT), which diverged from PITA in a bilaterian ancestor. Most PITA descendants possess a death domain (DD) within their intracellular domain (ICD) but EXTs do not. PITA descendants are expressed in all bilaterian phyla and Cnidaria, but not in non-planulozoan ParaHoxozoa, suggesting that PITA originated in an ancestral planulozoan. Drosophila melanogaster TNFRs (Wengen (Wgn) and Grindelwald (Grnd)) were identified as divergent PITA descendants, providing the first evolutionary link between this model TNFR system and the mammalian TNFR superfamily. This study reveals PITA as the ancestor to human and Drosophila TNFR systems and describes an evolutionary model that will facilitate deciphering TNF-TNFR functions in health and disease.",

    "abstract": "Human genetics has been proposed to play an essential role in inter-individual differences in respiratory virus infection occurrence and outcomes. To systematically understand human genetic contributions to respiratory virus infection, we developed the database dbGSRV, a manually curated database that integrated the host genetic susceptibility and severity studies of respiratory viruses scattered over literatures in PubMed. At present, dbGSRV contains 1932 records of genetic association studies relating 1010 unique variants and seven respiratory viruses, manually curated from 168 published articles. Users can access the records by quick searching, batch searching, advanced searching and browsing. Reference information, infection status, population information, mutation information and disease relationship are provided for each record, as well as hyper links to public databases in convenient of users accessing more information. In addition, a visual overview of the topological network relationship between respiratory viruses and associated genes is provided. Therefore, dbGSRV offers a promising avenue to facilitate researchers to dissect human factors in respiratory virus infection, define novel drug targets, conduct risk stratification of population and develop personalized medicine approaches.\n\nDatabase URL: http://www.ehbio.com/dbGSRV/front/",

    "abstract": "Therapeutic targeting of the estrogen receptor (ER) is a clinically validated approach for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer (ER+ BC), but sustained response is limited by acquired resistance. Targeting the transcriptional coactivators required for estrogen receptor activity represents an alternative approach that is not subject to the same limitations as targeting estrogen receptor itself. In this report we demonstrate that the acetyltransferase activity of coactivator paralogs CREBBP/EP300 represents a promising therapeutic target in ER+ BC. Using the potent and selective inhibitor CPI-1612, we show that CREBBP/EP300 acetyltransferase inhibition potently suppresses in vitro and in vivo growth of breast cancer cell line models and acts in a manner orthogonal to directly targeting ER. CREBBP/EP300 acetyltransferase inhibition suppresses ER-dependent transcription by targeting lineage-specific enhancers defined by the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1. These results validate CREBBP/EP300 acetyltransferase activity as a viable target for clinical development in ER+ breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "In order to facilitate hydrological restoration efforts, initiatives have been conducted to promote tree growth in degraded and rewetted peatlands in Indonesia. For these initiatives to be successful, tree seedlings need to be able to survive flooding episodes, with or without shade. We investigated the survival rates and the formation of adventitious roots in the case of four tree species exposed to combinations of different shading and water levels under controlled conditions in a nursery, with artificial rainwater and with peat soils as the medium. The research focused on the following questions (i) whether trees can grow on flooded peat soils; and (ii) which plant traits allow plants to cope with inundation, with or without shade. The four tree species compared (Shorea balangeran, Cratoxylum arborescens, Nephelium lappaceum and Durio zibethinus) include two natural pioneer and two farmer-preferred fruit trees. The experiment used a split-split plot design with 48 treatment combinations and at least 13 tree-level replicates. The study found that S. balangeran and C. arborescens had relatively high survival rates and tolerated saturated condition for 13 weeks, while N. lappaceum and D. zibethinus required non-saturated peat conditions. S. balangeran and C. arborescens developed adventitious roots to adapt to the inundated conditions. D. zibethinus, S. balangeran and N. lappaceum grew best under moderate (30%) shading levels, while C. arborescent grew best in full sunlight.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii has numerous, large, paralogous gene families that are likely critical for supporting its unparalleled host range: nearly any nucleated cell in almost any warm-blooded animal. The SRS (SAG1-related sequence) gene family encodes over 100 proteins, the most abundant of which are thought to be involved in parasite attachment and, based on their stage-specific expression, evading the host immune response. For most SRS proteins, however, little is understood about their function and expression profile. Single-parasite RNA-sequencing previously demonstrated that across an entire population of lab-grown tachyzoites, transcripts for over 70 SRS genes were detected in at least one parasite. In any one parasite, however, transcripts for an average of only 7 SRS genes were detected, two of which, SAG1 and SAG2A, were extremely abundant and detected in virtually all. These data do not address whether this pattern of sporadic SRS gene expression is consistently inherited among the progeny of a given parasite or arises independently of lineage. We hypothesized that if SRS expression signatures are stably inherited by progeny, subclones isolated from a cloned parent would be more alike in their expression signatures than they are to the offspring of another clone. In this report, we compare transcriptomes of clonally derived parasites to determine the degree to which expression of the SRS family is stably inherited in individual parasites. Our data indicate that in RH tachyzoites, SRS genes are variably expressed even between parasite samples subcloned from the same parent within approximately 10 parasite divisions (72 hours). This suggests that the pattern of sporadically expressed SRS genes is highly variable and not driven by inheritance mechanisms, at least under our conditions.",

    "abstract": "Omicron, the most heavily mutated SARS-CoV-2 variant so far, is highly resistant to neutralizing antibodies, raising unprecedented concerns about the effectiveness of antibody therapies and vaccines. We examined whether sera from individuals who received two or three doses of inactivated vaccine, could neutralize authentic Omicron. The seroconversion rates of neutralizing antibodies were 3.3% (2/60) and 95% (57/60) for 2- and 3-dose vaccinees, respectively. For three-dose recipients, the geometric mean neutralization antibody titer (GMT) of Omicron was 15, 16.5-fold lower than that of the ancestral virus (254). We isolated 323 human monoclonal antibodies derived from memory B cells in 3-dose vaccinees, half of which recognize the receptor binding domain (RBD) and show that a subset of them (24/163) neutralize all SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), including Omicron, potently. Therapeutic treatments with representative broadly neutralizing mAbs individually or antibody cocktails were highly protective against SARS-CoV-2 Beta infection in mice. Atomic structures of the Omicron S in complex with three types of all five VOC-reactive antibodies defined the binding and neutralizing determinants and revealed a key antibody escape site, G446S, that confers greater resistance to one major class of antibodies bound at the right shoulder of RBD through altering local conformation at the binding interface. Our results rationalize the use of 3-dose immunization regimens and suggest that the fundamental epitopes revealed by these broadly ultrapotent antibodies are a rational target for a universal sarbecovirus vaccine.\n\nOne sentence summaryA sub-set of antibodies derived from memory B cells of volunteers vaccinated with 3 doses of an inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine work individually as well as synergistically to keep variants, including Omicron, at bay.",
