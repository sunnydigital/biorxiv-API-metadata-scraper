    "abstract": "Epe1 histone demethylase restricts H3K9-methylation-dependent heterochromatin, preventing it from spreading over, and silencing, gene-containing regions in fission yeast. External stress induces an adaptive response allowing heterochromatin island formation that confers resistance on surviving wild-type lineages. Here we investigate the mechanism by which Epe1 is regulated in response to stress. Exposure to caffeine or antifungals results in Epe1 ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent removal of the N-terminal 150 residues from Epe1, generating truncated tEpe1 which accumulates in the cytoplasm. Constitutive tEpe1 expression increases H3K9 methylation over several chromosomal regions, reducing expression of underlying genes and enhancing resistance. Reciprocally, constitutive non- cleavable Epe1 expression decreases resistance. tEpe1-mediated resistance requires a functional JmjC demethylase domain. Moreover, caffeine-induced Epe1-to-tEpe1 cleavage is dependent on an intact cell-integrity MAP kinase stress signalling pathway, mutations in which alter resistance. Thus, environmental changes provoke a mechanism that curtails the function of this key epigenetic modifier, allowing heterochromatin to reprogram gene expression, thereby bestowing resistance to some cells within a population. H3K9me-heterochromatin components are conserved in human and crop plant fungal pathogens for which a limited number of antifungals exist. Our findings reveal how transient heterochromatin-dependent antifungal resistant epimutations develop and thus inform on how they might be countered.",

    "abstract": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) are present at the cell surface in different conformational and oligomeric states. However, how these states impact GPCRs biological function and therapeutic targeting remains incompletely known. Here, we investigated this issue in living cells for the CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5), a major receptor in inflammation and the principal entry co-receptor for Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV-1). We used TIRF microscopy and an original statistical method to track and classify the motion of different receptors subpopulations. We showed a diversity of ligand-free forms of CCR5 at the cell surface constituted of various oligomeric states and exhibiting transient Brownian and restricted motions. These forms were stabilized differently by distinct ligands. In particular, agonist stimulation restricted the mobility of CCR5 and led to its clustering, a feature depending on {beta}-arrestin, while inverse agonist stimulation exhibited the opposite effect. These results suggest a link between receptor activation and immobilization. Applied to HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins gp120, our quantitative analysis revealed agonist-like properties of gp120s. Distinct gp120s influenced CCR5 dynamics differently, suggesting that they stabilize different CCR5 conformations. Then, using a dimerization-compromized mutant, we showed that dimerization (i) impacts CCR5 precoupling to G proteins, (ii) is a pre-requisite for the immobilization and clustering of receptors upon activation, and (iii) regulates receptor endocytosis, thereby impacting the fate of activated receptors. This study demonstrates that tracking the dynamic behavior of a GPCR is an efficient way to link GPCR conformations to their functions, therefore improving the development of drugs targeting specific receptor conformations.",

    "abstract": "Nonmuscle myosin II minifilaments have emerged as central elements for force generation and mechanosensing by mammalian cells. Each minifilament can have a different composition and activity due to the existence of the three nonmuscle myosin II isoforms A, B and C and their respective phosphorylation pattern. We have used CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout cells, quantitative image analysis and mathematical modelling to dissect the dynamic processes that control the formation and activity of heterotypic minifilaments and found a strong asymmetry between isoforms A and B. Loss of NM IIA completely abrogates regulatory light chain phosphorylation and reduces the level of assembled NM IIB. Activated NM IIB preferentially co-assembles into pre-formed NM IIA minifilaments and stabilizes the filament in a force-dependent mechanism. NM IIC is only weakly coupled to these processes. We conclude that NM IIA and B play clearly defined complementary roles during assembly of functional minifilaments. NM IIA is responsible for the formation of nascent pioneer minifilaments. NM IIB incorporates into these and acts as a clutch that limits the force output to prevent excessive NM IIA activity. Together these two isoforms form a balanced system for regulated force generation.",

    "abstract": "Drosophila sperm development is characterized by extensive post-transcriptional regulation whereby thousands of transcripts are preserved for translation during later stages. A key step in translation initiation is the binding of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) to the 5 mRNA cap. Drosophila has multiple paralogs of eIF4E, including four (eIF4E-3, -4, -5, and -7) that are highly expressed in the testis. Other than eIF4E-3, none of these has been characterized genetically. Here, using CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis, we determined that eIF4E-5 is essential for male fertility. eIF4E-5 mutants exhibit defects during post-meiotic stages, including a fully penetrant defect in individualization, resulting in failure to produce mature sperm. eIF4E-5 protein localizes to the distal ends of elongated spermatid cysts, where it regulates non-apoptotic caspase activity during individualization by promoting local accumulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase inhibitor Soti. eIF4E-5 mutants also have mild defects in spermatid cyst polarization, similar to mutants affecting the cytoplasmic polyadenylation-element binding protein Orb2 and atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). Our results further extend the diversity of non-canonical eIF4Es that carry out distinct spatiotemporal roles during spermatogenesis.\n\nSummary StatementThe testis-enriched translation initiation factor eIF4E-5 is needed for spermatid cyst polarization, individualization of mature sperm and male fertility in Drosophila.",

    "abstract": "1.Honeybees (Apis Mellifera) perform an essential role in the ecosystem and economy through pollination of insect-pollinated plants, but their population is declining. Many causes of honeybees decline are likely to be influenced by the microbiome which is thought to play an important role in bees and is particularly susceptible to infection and pesticides. However, there has been no systematic review or meta-analysis on honeybee microbiome data. Therefore, we conducted the first systematic meta-analysis of 16S-rRNA data to address this gap in the literature. Four studies were in a usable format - accounting for 336 honeybees worth of data - the largest such dataset to the best of our knowledge. We analysed these datasets in QIIME2 and visualised the results in R-studio. For the first time, we conducted a multi-study evaluation of the core and rare bee microbiome and confirmed previous compositional microbiome data. We established that Snodgrassella, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium, Fructobacillus and Saccaribacter form part of the core microbiome and identify 251 rare bacterial genera. Additional components of the core microbiome were likely obscured by incomplete classification. Future studies should refine and add to our existing dataset to produce a more conclusive and high-resolution portrait of the honeybee microbiome. Furthermore, we emphasise the need for an actively curated dataset and enforcement of data sharing standards.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=150 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/473299v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (28K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d9c414org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d82d2forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17e6aa1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@8aa415_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1C_FLOATNO Graphical abstract.\n\nMade by the author in Biorender.com.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Salmon rickettsial septicaemia (SRS), caused by the intracellular bacteria Piscirickettsia Salmonis, generates significant mortalities to farmed Atlantic salmon, particularly in Chile. Due to its economic importance, a wealth of research has focussed on the biological mechanisms underlying pathogenicity of P. salmonis, the host response, and genetic variation in host resistance. DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic mechanism that influences almost every biological process via the regulation of gene expression and plays a key role in the response of an organism to stimuli. In the current study, the role of head kidney and liver DNA methylation in the response to P. salmonis infection was investigated in a commercial Atlantic salmon population. A total of 66 salmon were profiled using reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS), with head kidney and liver methylomes compared between infected animals (3 and 9 days post infection) and uninfected controls. These included groups of salmon with divergent (high or low) breeding values for resistance to P. salmonis infection, to examine the influence of genetic resistance. Head kidney and liver showed organ-specific global methylation patterns, but with similar distribution of methylation across gene features. Integration of methylation with RNA-Seq data revealed that methylation levels predominantly showed a negative correlation with gene expression, although positive correlations were also observed. Methylation within the first exon showed the strongest negative correlation with gene expression. A total of 911 and 813 differentially methylated CpG sites were identified between infected and control samples in the head kidney at 3 and 9 days respectively, whereas only 30 and 44 sites were differentially methylated in the liver. Differential methylation in the head kidney was associated with immunological processes such as actin cytoskeleton regulation, phagocytosis, endocytosis and pathogen associated pattern receptor signaling. We also identified 113 and 48 differentially methylated sites between resistant and susceptible fish in the head kidney and liver respectively. Our results contribute to the growing understanding of the role of methylation in regulation of gene expression and response to infectious diseases, and in particular reveal key immunological functions regulated by methylation in Atlantic salmon in response to P. salmonis.",

This study aims to gain a detailed information about the conformational changes and the dynamics of the complex. The right parameters and force field for performing the MD simulations that was needed to calibrate the complex structure were determined. The non-bonded interactions (Electrostatic and van der Waals contributions), H-bond formation, and salt bridges between the ligand HLA-Cw4 and the receptor KIR2DL1 were estimated using the obtained MD trajectories. The buried surface area due to binding was calculated to get insight into the causes of specificity of receptor to ligand and explains mutations experiment. The study concluded that {beta}2-microglobulin, one part of the complex, is not directly interacting with the peptide at the groove; therefore, it could be neglected from simulation. Our results showed that {beta}2-microglobulin does not have any significant effect on the dynamics of the 3D-structure of the complex. This project will help in understanding to optimize candidate drug design, a small peptide that disrupts the interaction, for the optimal biological effect.",

    "abstract": "The literature of Equality of Opportunity (EOp) has long acknowledged the existence of  talents,  innate ability or  genetic ability. Nonetheless, attempts to explicitly incorporate a measure of innate ability in the quantification of EOp have been rare. On the other hand, the literature of social-science genetics has found credible genetic-based components of EOp, without an explicit quantification of overall EOp. In addition, there exists prevalent disagreement within both kinds of literature on whether innate ability should be perceived as a fair or unfair source of advantage. This paper proposes to quantify EOp while explicitly including a genetic-based measure of innate ability. It proposes two formal definitions of EOp that draw on both stances regarding the compensation of innate ability. Novel testable implications are derived. The educational attainment polygenic index is used as a measure of innate ability while correcting for genetic nurture and accounting for the correlation between genes and other circumstances. An empirical application in the US Health and Retirement Study finds that the share of inequality of opportunity is 26% under the view that genetic differences are unfair sources of advantage and 21% otherwise. A comparative analysis over cohorts reveals that the trend in EOp depends on the definition adopted; if genetic advantage is a fair source of inequality then EOp has improved; the opposite holds if one considers genetic advantage an unfair source of inequality. These results highlight the importance of accounting for genetic differences in the EOp framework.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has swept the whole world with high mortality. Since aerosol transmission is the main route of transmission, wearing a mask serves as a crucial preventive measure. An important parameter to evaluate the performance of a mask is the bacteria filtration efficiency (BFE). Aerosol mean particle size (MPS) and positive quality control value are two key indexes of BFE system.\n\nAimTo study the major influence factors of the mean particle size of bacterial aerosols and positive quality control value of BFE system.\n\nMethod and ResultsIn this study, we investigated the influence of Anderson sampler, spray flow, medium thickness, and peristaltic pump flow on the MPS of bacterial aerosols and positive quality control value of BFE system, respectively. The results show that the machining accuracy of Anderson sampler has great influence on aerosol MPS and positive quality control value. With the increase of aerosol spray flow rate, the positive quality control value will increase gradually, but the effect on aerosol MPS is not a simple linear relationship. As the agar medium thickness increased, the positive quality control value and aerosol MPS increased gradually. With the increase of peristaltic pump flow, the positive quality control value increased gradually, while the aerosol MPS was basically in a downward trend. When the peristatic pump flow rate was 0.1mL/min, the spray flow rate was 7.2L/min, the agar plate thickness was 27mL, and the Anderson sampler of Beijing Mingjie was used for the experiment, the aerosol MPS and positive quality control value were both within the acceptable range and were the optimal parameters.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides guidance for the manufacturers of the BFE system and improves the protective performance of masks, which is important for the human health, especially during the occurrence of viral pandemics such as \"COVID-19\".\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

Here we investigate the effect of foliar spraying of PPFM, 10% methanol,30% methanol, and their combinations on the growth, fruit quality, and yield of two strawberry cultivars. PPFM was isolated from cotton leaves using imprinting technique. 16S rRNA sequence analysis identified it to be Methylobacterium radiotolerance. Its 16S rRNA sequence were deposited in the Gene Bank under accession number MT644122.1. Two field experiments were conducted during the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 seasons to investigate the effect of foliar spraying of PPFM and methanol (10 and 30%) on the growth, fruit quality, and yield of two strawberry cultivars. The obtained results showed that, there were no significant differences in the most characteristics between the two cultivars except foliage fresh weight and early yield were higher in cv. Florid, however, Festival cv. recorded higher total yield /plant, anthocyanins and ascorbic acid content in both seasons. Spraying PPFM exhibited the highest values of chlorophyll, fresh weight, total yield and quality. Furthermore, PPFM combined with methanol 10% gave the highest values of leaf area, dry matter %, early yield and some fruit quality. Spraying cv. Florida with PPFM resulted in the best interactions for early yield. However, the best interaction for total yield and most fruit quality features was observed with Festival c.v. and spraying PPFM. It is reasonable to conclude that PPFM is the most effective treatment, increasing strawberry total yield/fed by 28.1 % in the 1st season and 27.91 % in the 2nd season compared to the control.",
