    "abstract": "Despite the lactate shuttle theory, how glial cells support axonal metabolism and function remains unclear. Lactate production is a common occurrence following anaerobic glycolysis in muscles. However, several other cell types, including some stem cells, activatezd macrophages and tumor cells, can produce lactate in presence of oxygen and cellular respiration, using Pyruvate Kinase 2 (PKM2) to divert pyruvate to lactate dehydrogenase. We show here that PKM2 is also upregulated in mature myelinating Schwann cells (mSC) of mouse sciatic nerve. Deletion of this isoform in PLP-expressing cells in mice leads to a deficit of lactate in mSC and in peripheral nerves. This had no detectable consequences on the myelin sheath. However, mutant mice developed a peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral nerve axons of mutant mice failed to maintain lactate homeostasis upon activity, resulting in an impaired production of mitochondrial ATP. Action potential propagation was not altered but axonal mitochondria transport was slowed down, muscle axon terminals retracted and motor neurons displayed cellular stress. Additional reduction of lactate availability through dichloroacetate treatment, which diverts pyruvate to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, further aggravated motor dysfunction in mutant mice. Thus, lactate production through aerobic glycolysis is essential in mSC for the long-term maintenance of peripheral nerve axon physiology and function.",

    "abstract": "L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (L-VDCC) integrate synaptic signals to facilitate a plethora of cellular mechanisms. L-VDCC dysfunction is implicated in several neurological and psychiatric diseases. Despite their importance, signals upstream of L-VDCC activity that regulate their channel density, however, are poorly defined. In disease models with overactive mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling (or mTORopathies), including tuberous sclerosis (TS) and Alzheimers disease (AD), we report a novel mechanism downstream of mTORC1 signaling that results in a deficit in dendritic L-VDCC activity. Deficits in L-VDCC activity are associated with increased expression of the mTORC1-regulated RNA-binding protein DJ-1. DJ-1 binds the mRNA coding the auxiliary Ca2+ channel subunit 2{delta}2 responsible for shuttling L-VDCC to the membrane and represses its expression. Moreover, this novel DJ-1/2{delta}2/L-VDCC pathway is disrupted in human AD and preclinical models of AD and TS. Our discovery that DJ-1 directs L-VDCC activity and L-VDCC-associated protein 2{delta}2 at the synapse suggests that DJ-1/2{delta}2/L-VDCC is a common, fundamental pathway disrupted in TS and AD that can be targeted in clinical mTORopathies.\n\nSignificance StatementMany neurological disorders share symptoms, despite disparity among diseases. Treatments are prescribed based on diagnosis rather than individual symptoms. While only treating symptoms may obscure the disease, mechanism-based drug development allows the two approaches to converge. Hub proteins, those that coordinate the expression of proteins that mediate specific cellular functions, may be dysregulated across a broad range of disorders. Herein, we show that the RNA-binding protein DJ-1 controls the activity of L-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC), via the expression of its auxiliary subunit alpha2delta2 (2{delta}2). Importantly, we demonstrate that this novel DJ-1/2{delta}2/L-VDCC pathway is commonly disrupted among neurological disorders, namely Alzheimers disease (AD) and Tuberous Sclerosis (TS). Collectively, these data rationalize mechanism-based drug therapy to treat disease.",

    "abstract": "In uncertain or unstable environments, sometimes the best decision is to change your mind. To shed light on this flexibility, we evaluated how the underlying decision policy adapts when the most rewarding action changes. Human participants performed a dynamic two-armed bandit task that manipulated the certainty in relative reward (conflict) and the reliability of action-outcomes (volatility). Continuous estimates of conflict and volatility contributed to shifts in exploratory states by changing both the rate of evidence accumulation (drift rate) and the amount of evidence needed to make a decision (boundary height), respectively. At the trialwise level, following a switch in the optimal choice, the drift rate plummets and the boundary height weakly spikes, leading to a slow exploratory state. We find that the drift rate drives most of this response, with an unreliable contribution of boundary height across experiments. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that pupillary responses associated with decision policy changes. We conclude that humans show a stereotypical shift in their decision policies in response to environmental changes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundAllorhizobium vitis (formerly named Agrobacterium vitis or Agrobacterium biovar 3) is the primary causative agent of crown gall disease of grapevine worldwide. We obtained and analyzed whole-genome sequences of diverse All. vitis strains to get insights into their diversification and taxonomy.\n\nResultsPairwise genome comparisons and phylogenomic analysis of various All. vitis strains clearly indicated that All. vitis is not a single species, but represents a species complex composed of several genomic species. Thus, we emended the description of All. vitis, which now refers to a restricted group of strains within the All. vitis species complex (i.e. All. vitis sensu stricto) and proposed a description of a novel species, All. ampelinum sp. nov. The type strain of All. vitis sensu stricto remains the current type strain of All. vitis, K309T. The type strain of All. ampelinum sp. nov. is S4T. We also identified sets of gene clusters specific to the All. vitis species complex, All. vitis sensu stricto and All. ampelinum, respectively, for which we predicted the biological function and infer the role in ecological diversification of these clades, including some we could experimentally validate. All. vitis species complex-specific genes confer tolerance to different stresses, including exposure to aromatic compounds. Similarly, All. vitis sensu stricto-specific genes confer the ability to degrade 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and a putative compound related to gentisic acid. All. ampelinum-specific genes have putative functions related to polyamine metabolism and nickel assimilation. Congruently with the genome-based classification, All. vitis sensu stricto and All. ampelinum were clearly delineated by MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Moreover, our genome-based analysis indicated that Allorhizobium is clearly separated from other genera of the family Rhizobiaceae.\n\nConclusionsComparative genomics and phylogenomic analysis provided novel insights into the diversification and taxonomy of Allorhizobium vitis species complex, supporting our redefinition of All. vitis sensu stricto and description of All. ampelinum. Our pan-genome analyses suggest that these species have differentiated ecologies, each relying on specialized nutrient consumption or toxic compound degradation to adapt to their respective niche.",

Stromal cells have been shown to support AML survival and progression through various mechanisms. Nonetheless, it is unclear whether AML cells could establish beneficial metabolic interactions with stromal cells. Here, we identify a novel metabolic crosstalk between AML and stromal cells where AML cells prompt stromal cells to secrete acetate for their own consumption to feed the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). By performing transcriptome analysis, tracer-based metabolic NMR analysis and ROS measurements, we observe that stromal cells present a higher rate of glycolysis. We also find that acetate in stromal cells is derived from pyruvate via chemical conversion under the influence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following ROS transfer from AML to stromal cells via gap junctions. Overall, we present a unique metabolic communication between AML and stromal cells that could potentially be exploited for adjuvant therapy.",

    "abstract": "There is an increasing use of shear wave ultrasound elastography to quantify mechanical properties of muscles under various conditions such as changes muscle length and levels of activation in healthy and pathological muscle. However, little is known about the variability in shear wave velocity among muscles as most studies investigate one specific muscle. The purpose of this study was to determine if the relationship between SWV and muscle activation is consistent across muscles with different architectures: biceps brachii, tibialis anterior, and medial gastrocnemius, All measures were made at matching levels of activation and approximately at the optimal length for each muscle to control for length-dependent changes in the relationship between activation and force or stiffness. We also conducted a control experiment to determine how the passive force within a muscle alters the relationship between muscle activation and shear wave velocity. The relationship between shear wave velocity-squared and activation above 10% MVC differed across muscles, with biceps brachii and medial gastrocnemius showing a lower slope than tibialis anterior. Shear wave velocity-squared also differed between muscles at the shortest length (p<0.001) and the increase in shear wave velocity-squared with muscle lengthening also differed between muscle types (p = 0.005) Muscle-specific differences could not be explained by the architectural features such as pennation angle, fiber length, and physiological cross-sectional area. Our results demonstrate that there is not a unique relationship between muscle activation and shear wave velocity, highlighting the importance of understanding the many factors contributing to shear wave propagation in muscle before elastography can be used to make quantitative comparisons across muscle types.",

    "abstract": "Studies of neuronal oscillations have contributed substantial insight into the mechanisms of visual, auditory and somatosensory perception. However, progress in such research in the human olfactory system has lagged behind. As a result, the electrophysiological properties of the human olfactory system are poorly understood, and in particular, whether stimulus-driven high frequency oscillations play a role in odor processing is unknown. Here, we used direct intracranial recordings from human piriform cortex during an odor identification task to show that three key oscillatory rhythms are an integral part of the human olfactory cortical response to smell: odor induces theta, beta and gamma rhythms in human piriform cortex. We further show that these rhythms have distinct relationships with perceptual behavior. Odor-elicited gamma oscillations occur only during trials in which the odor is accurately perceived, and features of gamma oscillations predict odor identification accuracy, suggesting they are critical for odor identity perception in humans. We also found that the amplitude of high-frequency oscillations is organized by the phase of low frequency signals shortly following sniff onset, only when odor is present. Our findings reinforce previous work on theta oscillations, suggest that gamma oscillations in human piriform cortex are important for perception of odor identity, and constitute a robust identification of the characteristic electrophysiological response to smell in the human brain. Future work will determine whether the distinct oscillations we identified reflect distinct perceptual features of odor stimuli.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus epidermidis causes some of the most hard-to-treat clinical infections by forming biofilms: Multicellular communities of bacteria encased in a protective matrix, supporting immune evasion and tolerance against antibiotics. Biofilms occur most commonly on medical implants, and a key event in implant colonization is the robust adherence to the surface, facilitated by interactions between bacterial surface proteins and host matrix components. S. epidermidis is equipped with a giant adhesive protein, Embp, which facilitates bacterial interactions with surface-deposited, but not soluble fibronectin. The structural basis behind this selective binding process has remained obscure. Using a suite of single-cell and single-molecule analysis techniques, we show that S. epidermidis is capable of such distinction because Embp binds specifically to fibrillated fibronectin on surfaces, while ignoring globular fibronectin in solution. S. epidermidis adherence is critically dependent on multi-valent interactions involving 50 fibronectin-binding repeats of Embp. This unusual, Velcro-like interaction proved critical for colonization of surfaces under high flow, making this newly identified attachment mechanism particularly relevant for colonization of intravascular devices, such as prosthetic heart valves or vascular grafts. Other biofilm-forming pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, express homologs of Embp and likely deploy the same mechanism for surface colonization. Our results may open for a novel direction in efforts to combat devastating, biofilm-associated infections, as the development of implant materials that steer the conformation of adsorbed proteins is a much more manageable task than avoiding protein adsorption altogether.\n\nGraphical abstractFibronectin exists in two different conformations in the body. It circulates in the bodily fluids in globular conformation, however, it become fibrillated once adsorbed to an implant surface. S. epidermidis possess a giant 1 MDa receptor known as Embp bind specifically to fibrillated Fn but not to the globular Fn.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=125 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/446437v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (45K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1999895org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@f0717corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1aa8773org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a2991b_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

This is especially challenging for soft tissues composed of hydrogels and cells as these materials readily deform, posing a barrier when trying to assess print fidelity and other properties non- destructively. Indeed, given the importance of structure-function relationships in most tissue types, establishing that the 3D architecture of the bioprinted construct matches its intended anatomic design is critical. Here we report development of a multimaterial bioprinting platform with integrated optical coherence tomography (OCT) for in situ volumetric imaging, error detection, and 3D reconstruction. While generally applicable to extrusion-based 3D bioprinting, we also report improvements to the Freeform Reversible Embedding of Suspended Hydrogels (FRESH) bioprinting process through new collagen bioink compositions, support bath optical clearing, and machine pathing. This enables high-fidelity 3D volumetric imaging with micron scale resolution over centimeter length scales, the ability to detect a range of print defect types within a 3D volume, and real-time imaging of the printing process at each print layer. These advances provide FRESH and other extrusion-based 3D bioprinting approaches with a comprehensive methodology for quality assessment that has been absent in the field to date, paving the way for translation of these engineered tissues to the clinic and ultimately to achieving regulatory approval.\n\nTeaserTransparent FRESH support bath enables in situ 3D volumetric imaging and validation of patient-derived tissue constructs.",

As contingencies are learned, variance can give-way to routines and stereotypies. This phenomenon is common across species but has not been well studied in the social domain, in which the stimulus an animal investigates, another individual, may react negatively to unexpected behaviors. Here we investigate the effects of social familiarity on interaction variability in degus, female members of which are predisposed to form relationships with new, same-sex individuals. Degus were presented with a series of 20 minute, dyadic \"reunion\" sessions across days, interleaving exposures to familiar and unfamiliar same-sex conspecifics. We found that session-to-session variability in males was higher between strangers compared with cagemates, suggesting males may establish relationships by testing different social roles. In contrast, following an initial exposure, female strangers showed lower session-to-session change compared with cagemates, potentially establishing new relationships by maintaining behavioral norms. Social novelty did not appear to affect variability of interaction timing within a session. Given ecological pressures on female degus to form large, stable social networks, the data are consistent with the notion that higher behavioral variability across encounters is maladaptive for establishing cooperative peer relationships.",

    "abstract": "Temporal patterning is an important mechanism for generating a great diversity of neuron subtypes from a seemingly homogenous progenitor pool in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Drosophila neuroblasts are temporally patterned by sequentially expressed Temporal Transcription Factors (TTFs). These TTFs are proposed to form a transcriptional cascade based on mutant phenotypes, although direct transcriptional regulation between TTFs has not been verified in most cases. Furthermore, it is not known how the temporal transitions are coupled with the generation of the appropriate number of neurons at each stage. We use neuroblasts of the Drosophila optic lobe medulla to address these questions and show that the expression of TTFs Sloppy-paired 1/ 2 (Slp1/2) is directly regulated at the transcriptional level by two other TTFs and the cell-cycle dependent Notch signaling through two cis-regulatory elements. We also show that supplying constitutively active Notch can rescue the delayed transition into the Slp stage in cell cycle arrested neuroblasts. Our findings reveal a novel Notch-pathway dependent mechanism through which the cell cycle progression regulates the timing of a temporal transition within a TTF transcriptional cascade.",

    "abstract": "Freshwater lakes represent an important source of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH4) to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are regulated to large parts by aerobic (MOx) and anaerobic (AOM) oxidation of methane that are important sinks in lakes. In contrast to marine benthic environments, our knowledge about the modes of AOM and the related methanotrophic microorganisms in anoxic lake sediments is still rudimentary. Here we demonstrate the occurrence of AOM in the anoxic sediments of Lake Sempach (Switzerland), with maximum in situ AOM rates observed within the surface sediment layers in presence of multiple groups of methanotrophic bacteria and various oxidants known to support AOM. However, substrate-amended incubations (with NO2-, NO3-, SO42-, Fe3+ and Mn4+) revealed that none of the electron acceptors previously reported to support AOM enhanced methane turnover in Lake Sempach sediments under anoxic conditions. In contrast, the addition of oxygen to the anoxic sediments resulted in an approximately tenfold increase in methane oxidation relative to the anoxic incubations. Phylogenetic and isotopic evidence indicate that both Type I and Type II aerobic methanotrophs were growing on methane under both oxic and anoxic conditions, although methane assimilation rates were an order of magnitude higher under oxic conditions. While the anaerobic electron acceptor responsible for AOM could not be identified, these findings expand our understanding of the metabolic versatility of canonically aerobic methanotrophs under anoxic conditions, with important implications for future investigations to identify methane oxidation processes. Bacterial AOM by facultative aerobic methane oxidizers might be of much larger environmental significance in reducing methane emissions than previously thought.",

    "abstract": "Genomes hold a treasure trove of protein fossils: fragments of formerly protein-coding DNA, which mainly come from transposable elements (TEs) or host genes. These fossils reveal ancient evolution of TEs and genomes, and many fossils have been exapted to perform diverse functions important for the hosts fitness. However, old and highly-degraded fossils are hard to identify, standard methods (e.g. BLAST) are not optimized for this task, and few Paleozoic protein fossils have been found.\n\nHere, a recently optimized method is used to find protein fossils in vertebrate genomes. It finds Paleozoic fossils predating the amphibian/amniote divergence from most major TE categories, including virus-related Polinton and Gypsy elements. It finds 10 fossils in the human genome (8 from TEs and 2 from host genes) that predate the last common ancestor of all jawed vertebrates, probably from the Ordovician period. It also finds types of transposon and retrotransposon not found in human before. These fossils have extreme sequence conservation, indicating exaptation: some have evidence of gene-regulatory function, and they tend to lie nearest to developmental genes. Some ancient fossils suggest \"genome tectonics\", where two fragments of one TE have drifted apart by up to megabases, possibly explaining gene deserts and large introns.\n\nThis paints a picture of great TE diversity in our aquatic ancestors, with patchy TE inheritance by later vertebrates, producing new genes and regulatory elements on the way. Host-gene fossils too have contributed anciently-conserved DNA segments. This paves the way to further studies of ancient protein fossils.",

    "abstract": "Natural evolution is driven by random mutations that improve fitness. In vitro evolution mimics this process, however, on a short time-scale and is driven by the given bait. Here, we used directed in vitro evolution of a random library of Uracil glycosylase (eUNG) displayed on yeast surface to select for binding to chaperones GroEL, DnaK+DnaJ+ATP (DnaKJ) or E.coli cell extract (CE). Using binding to the eUNG inhibitor Ugi as probe for native foldedess, the CE selected population was further divided to Ugi binders (+U) (native) or non-binders (-U). We found that GroEL, DnaKJ and CE-U select and enrich for mutations causing eUNG to misfold, with the three being enriched in mutations in buried and conserved positions, with a tendency to increase positive charge. Still, each selection, as well as CE+U and natural evolution of eUNG has its own trajectory. While GroEL and CE-U selected for mutants highly sensitive to protease cleavage, DnaKJ selected for partially structured misfolded species with a tendency to refold, making them less sensitive to proteases. CE+U selected for more neutral mutations than natural evolution. In a more general context, our results show that GroEL has a higher tendency to purge promiscuous misfolded protein mutants from the system, while DnaKJ binds mutants misfolding-prone species that are, upon chaperone release, more likely to natively refold. CE-U shares some of the properties of GroEL and DnaKJ selected populations, while harboring also unique properties, explained by the existence of additional chaperones in CE, such as Tig, HtpG and ClpB.",

    "abstract": "The reactions of -D-phosphohexomutases (PHM) are ubiquitous, key to primary metabolism and essential for several processes in all domains of life. The functionality of these enzymes relies on an initial auto-phosphorylation step which requires the presence of -D-glucose-1,6-bisphosphate (Glc-1,6-BP). While well investigated in vertebrates, the origin of this activator compound in bacteria is unknown. Here we show that the Slr1334 protein from the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocysitis sp. PCC 6803 is a Glc-1,6-BP-synthase. Biochemical analysis revealed that Slr1334 efficiently converts fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (Frc-1,6-BP) and -D-glucose-1-phosphate/-D-glucose-6-phosphate into Glc-1,6-BP and also catalyzes the reverse reaction. As inferred from phylogenetic analysis, the slr1334 product belongs to a primordial subfamily of PHMs that is present especially in deeply branching bacteria and also includes human commensals and pathogens. Remarkably, the homologue of Slr1334 in the human gut bacterium Bacteroides salyersiae catalyzes the same reaction, suggesting a conserved and essential role for the members of this PHM subfamily.",

    "abstract": "Faces are a rich source of social information that activate many different regions in the human brain. How do these regions develop? According to one prominent hypothesis, face selectivity must emerge in visual regions (e.g., the fusiform face area (FFA)) prior to regions in higher-order association cortex (e.g., the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC)). To test this hypothesis, we combined functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) datasets from awake human infants (total n=65 infants, aged 2.6-11.9 months) while they watched movies of faces, bodies, objects, and scenes. The youngest and oldest infants in this group had face-selective responses in both the ventral temporal cortex (the approximate location of adult FFA) and MPFC. Although the overall magnitude of responses to visual stimuli increased with age in FFA, face selectivity did not increase significantly with age in either region. Taken together, these results do not support the hypothesis that cortical function develops in visual regions like FFA prior to amodal regions like MPFC, instead suggesting that face-selective responses emerge in parallel across the brain.",

Herein, we applied track-weighted dynamic functional connectivity (tw-dFC), a model integrating structural, functional, and dynamic connectivity, on high quality diffusion weighted imaging and resting-state fMRI data from two independent repositories. The tw-dFC maps were analyzed using independent component analysis, aiming at identifying spatially independent white matter components which support dynamic changes in functional connectivity. Each component consisted of a spatial map of white matter bundles that show consistent fluctuations in functional connectivity at their endpoints, and a time course representative of such functional activity. These components show high intra-subject, inter-subject, and inter-cohort reproducibility. We provided also converging evidence that functional information about white matter activity derived by this method can capture biologically meaningful features of brain connectivity organization, as well as predict higher-order cognitive performance.",

It is still very challenging, however, to systematically discover small molecules that prevent the formation of these aberrant aggregates. Here, we describe a structure-based approach to identify small molecules that specifically inhibit the surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation step in the aggregation of -synuclein by binding to the surface of the amyloid fibrils. The resulting small molecules are screened using a combination of kinetic and thermodynamic assays for their ability to bind -synuclein fibrils and prevent the further generation of toxic oligomers. This study demonstrates that the combination of structure-based and kinetic-based drug discovery methods can lead to the identification of small molecules that selectively inhibit the autocatalytic proliferation of -synuclein aggregates.",

    "abstract": "Introduction and HypothesisHuman menopause transition and post-menopausal syndrome, driven by reduced ovarian activity and estrogen levels, are associated with an increased risk for symptoms including but not limited to sexual dysfunction, metabolic disease, and osteoporosis. Current treatments are limited in efficacy and may have adverse consequences, so investigation for additional treatment options is necessary. Previous studies have demonstrated that tibial nerve stimulation (TNS) or electro-acupuncture near the tibial nerve are minimally invasive treatments that increase vaginal blood perfusion or serum estrogen in the rat model. We hypothesized that TNS would protect against harmful reproductive and systemic changes associated with menopause.\n\nMethodsWe examined the effects of twice weekly TNS (0.2 ms pulse width, 20 Hz, 2x motor threshold) under ketamine-xylazine anesthesia in ovariectomized (OVX) female Sprague Dawley rats on menopause-associated physiological parameters including serum estradiol, body weight, blood glucose, bone health, and vaginal blood flow. Rats were split into three groups (n = 10 per group): 1) intact control (no stimulation), 2) OVX control (no stimulation), and 3) OVX stimulation (treatment group).\n\nResultsTNS did not affect serum estradiol levels, body weight, or blood glucose. TNS transiently increased vaginal blood perfusion during stimulation for up to 5 weeks after OVX and increased areal bone mineral density and yield load of the right femur (side of stimulation) compared to the unstimulated OVX control.\n\nConclusionTNS may ameliorate some symptoms associated with menopause. Additional studies to elucidate the full potential of TNS on menopause-associated symptoms under different experimental conditions are warranted.\n\nSummaryPercutaneous tibial nerve stimulation increases vaginal blood perfusion, areal bone mineral density, and femur yield load in an ovariectomized rat model of menopause.",

We developed a novel prioritization approach in which we mined and analyzed quantitative concepts and skills from publications that faculty in relevant units deemed central to the scientific comprehension of their field. The analysis provides a prioritization of quantitative skills and concepts and could represent an effective method to drive curricular focus based upon program-specific faculty input for biological science programs of all types. Our results highlight the disconnect between typical undergraduate quantitative education for life science students, focused on continuous mathematics, and the concepts and skills in graphics, statistics, and discrete mathematics that arise from priorities established by biomedical science faculty.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryWe developed a novel approach to prioritize quantitative concepts and methods for inclusion in a graduate biomedical science curriculum based upon approaches included in faculty-identified key publications.",

    "abstract": "A classic approach to estimate the individual theta-to-alpha transition frequency requires two electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, one acquired in restingstate condition and one showing an alpha de-synchronisation due e.g. to task execution. This translates into longer recording sessions that my be cumbersome in studies involving patients. Moreover, incomplete de-synchronisation of the alpha rhythm may compromise the final estimation of the transition frequency. Here we present transfreq, a Python library that allows the computation of the transition frequency from resting-state data by clustering the spectral profiles at different EEG channels based on their content in the alpha and theta bands. We first provide an overview of the transfreq core algorithm and of the software architecture. Then we demonstrate its feasibility and robustness across different experimental setups on a publicly available EEG data set and on in-house recordings.

In response to these changes, animals migrate or partition resources to minimize competition, resulting in temporal patterns within assemblages across multiple scales. Here, we demonstrate that the winter dry season bat assemblage in a semiarid grassland of northwest India exhibits both seasonal changes in composition and temporal avoidance between coexisting species at water bodies. Using a passive acoustic monitoring framework to quantify activity patterns at different points in the season, we show that two species (Rhinolophus lepidus and Tadarida aegyptiaca) exhibit seasonal differences in activity, being more frequently detected in the early and late parts of the dry season respectively. Two other species (Pipistrellus tenuis and Scotophilus heathii) do not exhibit seasonal changes in activity, but structure their diel activity patterns to minimize temporal overlap (and thus competition) at water bodies. These data, some of the first on bats from this region, demonstrate the complex temporal patterns structuring bat assemblages in arid and semiarid biomes. Our results hold promise for monitoring efforts, as a baseline to ascertain how climate change may influence the behavior and ecology of desert and grassland organisms.",

We identified West Nile Virus circulation in Camargue, a wetland area in South of France, using a cost effective innovative xenomonitoring method based on the molecular detection of virus in excreta from trapped mosquitoes. We also succeeded at identifying the mosquito community diversity dynamic on several sampling sites, together with the vertebrate hosts on which they fed prior to be captured using amplicon-based metagenomic on mosquito excreta without processing any mosquito.

In this study, an optimized next generation sequencing-based Circle-Seq method was developed to investigate urinary cell free eccDNA (ucf-eccDNA) from 28 adult healthy volunteers (mean age = 28, 19 males/ 9 females). The genomic distributions and sequence compositions of ucf-eccDNAs were comprehensively characterized. Approximately 1.2 million unique ucf-eccDNAs are identified, covering 14.9% of the human genome. Comprehensive characterization of ucf-eccDNAs show that ucf-eccDNAs contain higher GC content than flanking genomic regions. Most eccDNAs are less than 1000 bp and present four pronounced peaks at 203, 361, 550 and 728 bp, indicating the association between eccDNAs and the numbers of intact nucleosomes. Analysis of genomic distribution of ucf-eccDNAs show that eccDNAs are found in all chromosomes but enriched in chromosomes i.e. chr.17, 19 and 20 with high density of protein-codding genes, CpG islands, SINE and simple repeat elements. Lastly, analysis of sequence motif signatures at eccDNA junction sites reveal that direct repeats (DRs) are commonly found, indicating a potential role of DRs in eccDNA biogenesis. This work underscores the deep sequencing analysis of ucf-eccDNAs and provides a valuable reference resource for exploring potential applications of ucf-eccDNA as diagnostic biomarkers of urogenital disorders in the future.\n\nSignificance StatementExtrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) is an important genetic element and a biomarker for disease diagnosis and treatment. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive characterization of urinary cell free eccDNA (ucf-eccDNA) in 28 heathy subjects. Over one million ucf-eccDNAs are identified. Ucf-eccDNAs are characterized as high GC content. The size of most ucf-eccDNAs is less than 1000 bp and enriched in four peaks resembling the size of single, double, triple, and quadruple nucleosomes. The genomic distribution of ucf-eccDNAs is enriched in generic regions, protein-coding genes, Alu, CpG islands, SINE and simple repeats. Sequence motif analysis of ucf-eccDNA junctions identified simple direct repeats (DRs) commonly presented in most eccDNAs, suggesting potential roles of DRs in eccDNA biogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Small multidrug resistance (SMR) transporters contribute to antibiotic resistance through proton-coupled efflux of toxic compounds from the bacterial cytoplasm. Previous biophysical studies of the E. coli SMR transporter EmrE suggested that it should also be capable of performing proton/toxin symport or uniport, leading to toxin susceptibility rather than resistance in vivo. Here we show EmrE does confer susceptibility to several newly characterized small-molecule substrates in E. coli, including harmane. In vitro experiments show that harmane binding to EmrE triggers uncoupled proton uniport and this protein-mediated dissipation of the transmembrane pH gradient underlies the in vivo phenotype. This leads to synergy with some existing antibiotics, such as kanamycin. Furthermore, this shows that it is possible to not just inhibit multidrug efflux but activate alternative transport modes that are detrimental to bacterial growth and metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The frequent emergence of drug resistance during the treatment of influenza A virus (IAV) infections highlights a need for effective antiviral countermeasures. Here, we present an antiviral method that utilizes unnatural amino acid-engineered drug-resistant (UAA-DR) virus. The engineered virus is generated through genetic code expansion to combat emerging drug-resistant viruses. The UAA-DR virus has unnatural amino acids incorporated into its drug-resistant protein and its polymerase complex for replication control. The engineered virus can undergo genomic segment reassortment with normal virus and produce sterilized progenies due to artificial amber codons in the viral genome. We validate in vitro that UAA-DR can provide a broad-spectrum antiviral strategy for several H1N1 strains, different DR-IAV strains, multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, and even antigenically distant influenza strains (e.g., H3N2). Moreover, a minimum dose of neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors for influenza virus can further enhance the sterilizing effect when combating inhibitor-resistant strains, partly due to the promoted superinfection of unnatural amino acid-modified virus in cellular and animal models. We also exploited the engineered virus to achieve adjustable efficacy after external UAA administration, for mitigating DR virus infection on transgenic mice harboring the [Formula] pair, and to have substantial elements of the genetic code expansion technology, which further demonstrated the safety and feasibility of the strategy. We anticipate that the use of the UAA-engineered DR virion, which is a novel antiviral agent, could be extended to combat emerging drug-resistant influenza virus and other segmented RNA viruses.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound shear wave elastography can be used to characterize mechanical properties of unstressed tissue by measuring shear wave velocity (SWV), which increases with increasing tissue stiffness. Measurements of SWV have often been assumed to be directly related to the stiffness of muscle. Some have also used measures of SWV to estimate stress, since muscle stiffness and stress covary during active contractions. However, few have considered the direct influence of muscle stress on SWV, independent of the stress-dependent changes in muscle stiffness, even though it is well known that stress alters shear wave propagation. The objective of this study was to determine how well the theoretical dependency of SWV on stress can account for measured changes of SWV in passive and active muscle. Data were collected from six isoflurane-anesthetized cats; three soleus muscles and three medial gastrocnemius muscles. Muscle stress and stiffness were measured directly along with SWV. Measurements were made across a range of passively and actively generated stresses, obtained by varying muscle length and activation, which was controlled by stimulating the sciatic nerve. Our results show that SWV depends primarily on the stress in a passively stretched muscle. In contrast, the SWV in active muscle is higher than would be predicted by considering only stress, presumably due to activation-dependent changes in muscle stiffness. Our results demonstrate that while SWV is sensitive to changes in muscle stress and activation, there is not a unique relationship between SWV and either of these quantities when considered in isolation.",

    "abstract": "The ability to align individual cellular information from multiple experimental sources, techniques and systems is fundamental for a true systems-level understanding of biological processes. While single-cell transcriptomic studies have transformed our appreciation for the complexities and contributions of diverse cell types to disease, they can be limited in their ability to assess protein-level phenotypic information and beyond. Therefore, matching and integrating single-cell datasets which utilize robust protein measurements across multiple modalities is critical for a deeper understanding of cell states, and signaling pathways particularly within their native tissue context. Current available tools are mainly designed for single-cell transcriptomics matching and integration, and generally rely upon a large number of shared features across datasets for mutual Nearest Neighbor (mNN) matching. This approach is unsuitable when applied to single-cell proteomic datasets, due to the limited number of parameters simultaneously accessed, and lack of shared markers across these experiments. Here, we introduce a novel cell matching algorithm, Matching with pARtIal Overlap (MARIO), that takes into account both shared and distinct features, while consisting of vital filtering steps to avoid sub-optimal matching. MARIO accurately matches and integrates data from different single-cell proteomic and multi-modal methods, including spatial techniques, and has cross-species capabilities. MARIO robustly matched tissue macrophages identified from COVID-19 lung autopsies via CODEX imaging to macrophages recovered from COVID-19 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid via CITE-seq. This cross-platform integrative analysis enabled the identification of unique orchestrated immune responses within the lung of complement-expressing macrophages and their impact on the local tissue microenvironment. MARIO thus provides an analytical framework for unified analysis of single-cell data for a comprehensive understanding of the underlying biological system.",

Quantitative studies of their growth have typically focused on unconfined expansion above solid or semi-solid surfaces, leading to exponential radial growth.

Here we consider one of the simplest confined geometries: a biofilm growing laterally in the space between a solid surface and an overlying elastic sheet. A poroelastic framework is utilised to derive the radial growth rate of the biofilm; it reveals an additional self-similar expansion regime, governed by the stiffness of the matrix, leading to a finite maximum radius, consistent with our experimental observations of growing Bacillus subtilis biofilms confined by PDMS.",

These data may come from from simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron model or from laboratory current clamp experiments. In each case the reduced dimension data driven forecasting (DDF) models are shown to predict accurately for times after the training period.\n\nWhen the available observations for neuron preparations are, for example, membrane voltage V(t) only, we use the technique of time delay embedding from nonlinear dynamics to generate an appropriate space in which the full dynamics can be realized.\n\nThe DDF constructions are reduced dimension models relative to HH models as they are built on and forecast only observables such as V(t). They do not require detailed specification of ion channels, their gating variables, and the many parameters that accompany an HH model for laboratory measurements, yet all of this important information is encoded in the DDF model.\n\nAs the DDF models use only voltage data and forecast only voltage data, they can be used in building networks with biophysical connections. Both gap junction connections and ligand gated synaptic connections among neurons involve presynaptic voltages and induce postsynaptic voltage response. Biophysically based DDF neuron models can replace other reduced dimension neuron models, say of the integrate-and-fire type, in developing and analyzing large networks of neurons.\n\nWhen one does have detailed HH model neurons for network components, a reduced dimension DDF realization of the HH voltage dynamics may be used in network computations to achieve computational efficiency and the exploration of larger biological networks.",

    "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy, a central tool of biological research, is subject to inherent trade-offs in experiment design. For instance, image acquisition speed can only be increased in exchange for a lowered signal quality, or for an increased rate of photo-damage to the specimen. Computational denoising can recover some loss of signal, extending the trade-off margin for high-speed imaging. Recently proposed denoising on the basis of neural networks shows exceptional performance but raises concerns of errors typical of neural networks. Here, we present a work-flow that supports an empirically optimized reduction of exposure times, as well as per-image quality control to exclude images with reconstruction errors. We implement this work-flow on the basis of the denoising tool Noise2Void and assess the molecular state and three-dimensional shape of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) clusters in live zebrafish embryos. Image acquisition speed could be tripled, achieving 2-second time resolution and 350-nanometer lateral image resolution. The obtained data reveal stereotyped events of approximately 10 seconds duration: initially, the molecular mark for initiated Pol II increases, then the mark for active Pol II increases, and finally Pol II clusters take on a stretched and unfolded shape. An independent analysis based on fixed sample images reproduces this sequence of events, and suggests that they are related to the transient association of genes with Pol II clusters. Our work-flow consists of procedures that can be implemented on commercial fluorescence microscopes without any hardware or software modification, and should therefore be transferable to many other applications.",

Towards this end, we propose a novel statistical physics inspired neuron particle model that captures the causal information flow and processing features of neuronal spiking activity. Relying on synthetic comprehensive simulations and real-world neuronal spiking activity analysis, the proposed fractional order operators governing the neuronal spiking dynamics provide insights into the memory and scale of the spike trains as well as information about the topological properties of the underlying neuronal networks.

    "abstract": "We present a simple model which can account for the stereoscopic sensitivity of praying mantis predatory strikes. The model consists of a single \"disparity sensor\": a binocular neuron sensitive to stereoscopic disparity and thus to distance from the animal. The model is based closely on the known behavioural and neurophysiological properties of mantis stereopsis. The monocular inputs to the neuron reflect temporal change and are insensitive to contrast sign, making the sensor insensitive to interocular correlation. The monocular receptive fields have a excitatory centre and inhibitory surround, making them tuned to size. The disparity sensor combines inputs from the two eyes linearly, applies a threshold and then an exponent output nonlinearity. The activity of the sensor represents the model mantiss instantaneous probability of striking. We integrate this over the stimulus duration to obtain the expected number of strikes in response to moving targets with different stereoscopic distance, size and vertical disparity. We optimised the parameters of the model so as to bring its predictions into agreement with our empirical data on mean strike rate as a function of stimulus size and distance. The model proves capable of reproducing the relatively broad tuning to size and narrow tuning to stereoscopic distance seen in mantis striking behaviour. The model also displays realistic responses to vertical disparity. Most surprisingly, although the model has only a single centre-surround receptive field in each eye, it displays qualitatively the same interaction between size and distance as we observed in real mantids: the preferred size increases as prey distance increases beyond the preferred distance. We show that this occurs because of a stereoscopic \"false match\" between the leading edge of the stimulus in one eye and its trailing edge in the other; further work will be required to find whether such false matches occur in real mantises. This is the first image-computable model of insect stereopsis, and reproduces key features of both neurophysiology and striking behaviour.",

Here, we present an automated and robust BIDS-App, HippUnfold, for defining and indexing individual-specific hippocampal folding in MRI, analogous to popular tools used in neocortical reconstruction. Such tailoring is critical for inter-individual alignment, with topology serving as the basis for homology. This topological framework enables qualitatively new analyses of morphological and laminar structure in the hippocampus or its subfields. It is critical for refining current neuroimaging analyses at a meso- as well as micro-scale. HippUnfold uses state-of-the-art deep learning combined with previously developed topological constraints to generate uniquely folded surfaces to fit a given subjects hippocampal conformation. It is designed to work with commonly employed sub-millimetric MRI acquisitions, with possible extension to microscopic resolution. In this paper we describe the power of HippUnfold in feature extraction, and highlight its unique value compared to several extant hippocampal subfield analysis methods.",

However, stimuli presented in specific egocentric locations may have greater behavioural relevance, raising the possibility that the extent of contextual modulation may vary with position in visual space. To explore this possibility we utilised the small size and optical transparency of the larval zebrafish to describe the form and spatial arrangement of contextually modulated cells throughout an entire tectal hemisphere. We found that the spatial tuning of tectal neurons to a prey-like stimulus sharpens when the stimulus is presented in the context of a naturalistic visual scene. These neurons are confined to a spatially restricted region of the tectum and have receptive fields centred within a region of visual space in which the presence of prey preferentially triggers hunting behaviour. Our results demonstrate that circuits that support behaviourally relevant modulation of tectal neurons are not uniformly distributed. These findings add to the growing body of evidence that the tectum shows regional adaptations for behaviour.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding movement patterns of anadromous fishes is critical to conservation management of declining wild populations and preservation of habitats. Yet, infrequent observations of individual animals fundamentally constrain accurate descriptions of movement dynamics.\n\nMethodsIn this study, we synthesized over a decade (2006-2018) of acoustic telemetry tracking observations of green sturgeon (Acipenser medirostris) in the Sacramento River system to describe major anadromous movement patterns.\n\nResultsWe observed that green sturgeon exhibited a unimodal in-migration during the spring months but had a bimodal distribution of out-migration timing, split between an  early out-migration (32%) group during May - June, or alternatively, holding in the river until a  late out-migration (68%), November - January. Focusing on these out-migration groups, we found that river discharge, but not water temperature, may cue the timing of migration, and that fish showed a tendency to maintain out-migration timing between subsequent spawning migration events.\n\nConclusionsWe recommend that life history descriptions of green sturgeon in this region reflect the distinct out-migration periods described here. Furthermore, we encourage the continued use of biotelemetry to describe migration timing and life history variation, not only this population but other green sturgeon populations and other species.",

    "abstract": "Thoracic radiation therapy can cause endothelial injury in the heart, leading to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Although it has been demonstrated that the tumor suppressor p53 functions in endothelial cells to prevent the development of radiation-induced myocardial injury, the key mechanism(s) by which p53 regulates the radiosensitivity of cardiac endothelial cells is not completely understood. Here, we utilized genetically engineered mice that express mutations in p53 transactivation domain 1 (TAD1) (p5325,26) or mutations in p53 TAD1 and TAD2 (p5325,26,53,54) specifically in endothelial cells to study the p53 transcriptional program that protects cardiac endothelial cells from ionizing radiation in vivo. p5325,26,53,54 loses the ability to drive transactivation of p53 target genes after irradiation while p5325,26 can induce transcription of a group of non-canonical p53 target genes, but not the majority of classic radiation-induced p53 targets critical for p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. After 12 Gy whole-heart irradiation, we found that both p5325,26 and p5325,26,53,54 sensitized mice to radiation-induced cardiac injury, in contrast to wild-type p53. Histopathological examination suggested that mutation of TAD1 contributes to myocardial necrosis after whole-heart irradiation, while mutation of both TAD1 and TAD2 abolishes the ability of p53 to prevent radiation-induced heart disease. Taken together, our results show that the transcriptional program downstream of p53 TAD1, which activates the acute DNA damage response after irradiation, is necessary to protect cardiac endothelial cells from radiation injury in vivo.",

    "abstract": "A grand challenge in microbial ecology is disentangling the traits of individual populations within complex communities. Various cultivation-independent approaches have been used to infer traits based on the presence of marker genes. However, marker genes are not linked to traits with complete fidelity, nor do they capture important attributes, such as the timing of expression or coordination among traits. To address this, we present an approach for assessing the trait landscape of microbial communities by statistically defining a trait attribute as shared transcriptional pattern across multiple organisms. Leveraging the KEGG pathway database as a trait library and the Enhanced Biological Phosphorus Removal (EBPR) model microbial ecosystem, we demonstrate that a majority (65%) of traits present in 10 or more genomes have niche-differentiating expression attributes. For example, while 14 genomes containing the high-affinity phosphorus transporter pstABCS display a canonical attribute (e.g. up-regulation under phosphorus starvation), we identified another attribute shared by 11 genomes where transcription was highest under high phosphorus conditions. Taken together, we provide a novel framework for revealing hidden metabolic versatility when investigating genomic data alone by assigning trait-attributes through genome-resolved time-series metatranscriptomics.",

    "abstract": "NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are multicolor silver nanocluster probes whose fluorescence can be activated or tuned by a proximal DNA strand called the activator. While a single-nucleotide difference in a pair of activators can lead to drastically different activation outcomes, termed the polar opposite twins (POTs), it is difficult to discover new POT-NCBs using the conventional low-throughput characterization approaches. Here we report a high-throughput selection method that takes advantage of repurposed next-generation-sequencing (NGS) chips to screen the activation fluorescence of [~]40,000 activator sequences. We find the nucleobases at positions 7-12 of the 18-nucleotide-long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4-6 and 2-4 are hotspots to generate yellow and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, we propose a \"zipper bag model\" that explains how these hotspots lead to the creation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and contribute to the difference in chromophore chemical yields. Combining high-throughput screening with machine learning algorithms, we establish a pipeline to rationally design bright and multicolor NCBs.",

    "abstract": "Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are ubiquitous in the environment and pose a serious risk to human and veterinary health. While many studies focus on the spread of live antibiotic resistant bacteria throughout the environment, it is unclear whether extracellular ARGs from dead cells can transfer to live bacteria to facilitate the evolution of antibiotic resistance in nature. Here, we inoculate antibiotic-free soil with extracellular ARGs (eARGs) from dead Pseudeononas stutzeri cells and track the evolution of antibiotic resistance via natural transformation - a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer involving the genomic integration of eARGs. We find that transformation facilitates the rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance even when eARGs occur at low concentrations (0.25 g g-1 soil). However, when eARGs are abundant, transformation increases substantially. The evolution of antibiotic resistance was high under soil moistures typical in terrestrial systems (5%-30% gravimetric water content) and was only inhibited at very high soil moistures (>30%). While eARGs transformed into live cells at a low frequency, exposure to a low dose of antibiotic allowed a small number of transformants to reach high abundances in laboratory populations, suggesting even rare transformation events pose a risk to human health. Overall, this work demonstrates that dead bacteria and their eARGs are an overlooked path to antibiotic resistance, and that disinfection alone is insufficient to stop the spread of antibiotic resistance. More generally, the spread of eARGs in antibiotic-free soil suggests that transformation allows genetic variants to establish at low frequencies in the absence of antibiotic selection.\n\nImportanceOver the last decade, antibiotics in the environment have gained increasing attention because they can select for drug-resistant phenotypes that would have otherwise gone extinct. To counter this effect, bacterial populations exposed to antibiotics often undergo disinfection. However, the release of extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) into the environment following disinfection can promote the transfer of eARGs through natural transformation. This phenomenon is well-documented in wastewater and drinking water, but yet to be investigated in soil. Our results directly demonstrate that eARGs from dead bacteria are an important, but often overlooked source of antibiotic resistance in soil. We conclude that disinfection alone is insufficient to prevent the spread of ARGs. Special caution should be taken in releasing antibiotics into the environment, even if there are no live antibiotic resistant bacteria in the community, as transformation allows DNA to maintain its biological activity past microbial death.",

    "abstract": "Environmental stress can result in epigenetic modifications that are passed down several generations. Such epigenetic inheritance can have significant impact on eco-evolutionary dynamics, but the phenomenon remains controversial in ecological model systems. Here, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing on individual water fleas (Daphnia magna) to assess whether environmentally-induced DNA methylation can persist for up to four generations. Genetically identical females were exposed to a control treatment, one of three natural stressors (high temperature, zinc, microcystin), or the methylation-inhibitor 5-azacytidine. After exposure, lines were propagated clonally for four generations under control conditions. We identified between 70 and 225 differentially methylated CpG positions (DMPs) between controls and F1 individuals whose mothers (and therefore they themselves as germ cells) were exposed to one of the three natural stressors. Between 46% and 58% of these environmentally-induced DMPs persisted until generation F4 without attenuation in their magnitude of differential methylation. DMPs were enriched in exons and largely stressor-specific, suggesting a possible role in environment-dependent gene regulation. In contrast, treatment with the compound 5-azacytidine demonstrated that pervasive hypo-methylation upon exposure is reset almost completely after a single generation. These results suggest that environmentally-induced DNA methylation is non-random and stably inherited across generations in Daphnia, making epigenetic inheritance a putative factor in the eco-evolutionary dynamics of fresh-water communities.\n\nAuthor summaryWater fleas are important keystone species mediating eco-evolutionary dynamics in lakes and ponds. It is currently an open question in how far epigenetic inheritance contributes to the ability of Daphnia populations to adapt to environmental stress. Using a range of naturally occurring stressors and a multi-generational design, we show that environmentally-induced DNA methylation variants are stably inherited for at least four generations in Daphnia magna. The induced variation in DNA methylation are stressor-specific and almost exclusively found in exons, bearing the signatures of functional adaptations. Our findings imply that ecological adaptations of Daphnia to seasonal fluctuations can be underpinned by epigenetic inheritance of DNA methylation without changes in gene frequencies.",
