    "abstract": "Imaging of proteoforms in human tissues is hindered by low molecular specificity and limited proteome coverage. Here, we introduce proteoform imaging mass spectrometry (PiMS), which increases the size limit for proteoform detection and identification by 4-fold compared to reported methods, and reveals tissue localization of proteoforms at <80 m spatial resolution. PiMS advances proteoform imaging by combining ambient nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI) with ion detection using individual ion mass spectrometry (I2MS). We demonstrate the first proteoform imaging of human kidney, identifying 169 of 400 proteoforms <70 kDa using top-down mass spectrometry and database lookup from the human proteoform atlas, including dozens of key enzymes in primary metabolism. PiMS images reveal distinct spatial localizations of proteoforms to both anatomical structures and cellular neighborhoods in the vasculature, medulla, and cortex regions of the human kidney. The benefits of PiMS are poised to increase proteome coverage for label-free protein imaging of tissues.\n\nTeaserNano-DESI combined with individual ion mass spectrometry generates images of proteoforms up to 70 kDa.",

    "abstract": "Deficiency of Cytochrome P450 Steroid 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) represents 90% of cases in congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), an autosomal recessive disease caused by defects in cortisol biosynthesis. Computational prediction along with functional studies are often the only way to classify variants to understand the links to disease-causing effects. Here we investigated the pathogenicity of uncharacterized variants in the CYP21A2 gene reported in the Brazilian and Portuguese populations. Physicochemical alterations, residue conservation, and effect on protein structure were accessed by computational analysis. The enzymatic performance was obtained by functional assay with the wild-type and mutant CYP21A2 proteins expressed in HEK293 cells. Computational analysis showed that p.W202R, p.E352V, and p.R484L have severely impaired the protein structure, while p.P35L, p.L199P, and p.P433L have moderate effects. The p.W202R, p.E352V, p.P433L, and p.R484L variants showed residual 21OH activity consistent with the simple virilizing phenotype. The p.P35L and p.L199P variants showed partial 21OH efficiency associated with the non-classical phenotype. Additionally, p.W202R, p.E352V and p.R484L also modified the protein expression level. We have determined how the selected CYP21A2 gene mutations affect the 21OH activity through structural and activity alteration contributing to the future diagnosis and management of 21OH deficiency.",

    "abstract": "The blood-brain barrier represents a significant challenge for the treatment of high-grade gliomas, and our understanding of drug transport across this critical biointerface remains limited. To advance preclinical therapeutic development for gliomas, there is an urgent need for predictive in vitro models with realistic blood-brain barrier vasculature. Here, we report a vascularized human glioblastoma (GBM) model in a microfluidic device that accurately recapitulates brain tumor vasculature with self-assembled endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes to investigate the transport of targeted nanotherapeutics across the blood-brain barrier and into GBM cells. Using modular layer-by-layer assembly, we functionalized the surface of nanoparticles with GBM-targeting motifs to improve trafficking to tumors. We directly compared nanoparticle transport in our in vitro platform with transport across mouse brain capillaries using intravital imaging, validating the ability of the platform to model in vivo blood-brain barrier transport. We investigated the therapeutic potential of functionalized nanoparticles by encapsulating cisplatin and showed improved efficacy of these GBM-targeted nanoparticles both in vitro and in an in vivo orthotopic xenograft model. Our vascularized GBM model represents a significant biomaterials advance, enabling in-depth investigation of brain tumor vasculature and accelerating the development of targeted nanotherapeutics.\n\nSignificance StatementThe blood-brain barrier represents a major therapeutic challenge for the treatment of glioblastoma, and there is an unmet need for in vitro models that recapitulate human biology and are predictive of in vivo response. Here we present a new microfluidic model of vascularized glioblastoma featuring a tumor spheroid in direct contact with self-assembled vascular networks comprised of human endothelial cells, astrocytes, and pericytes. This model was designed to accelerate the development of targeted nanotherapeutics, and enabled rigorous assessment of a panel of surface-functionalized nanoparticles designed to exploit a receptor overexpressed in tumor-associated vasculature. Trafficking and efficacy data in the in vitro model compared favorably to parallel in vivo data, highlighting the utility of the vascularized glioblastoma model for therapeutic development.",

Recent technological advances add additional layers of information allowing researchers to simultaneously explore the transcriptomic, surface protein and immune receptor diversity during adaptive immune responses. The increasing data complexity poses a burden on the workload for bioinformaticians, who are often not familiar with the specificities and biology of immune receptor profiling. The wet-lab modalities and sequencing capabilities currently have outpaced bioinformatics solutions, which forms an ever-increasing barrier for many biologists to analyze their datasets. Here, we present DALI (Diversity AnaLysis Interface), a software package to identify and analyze T cell and B cell receptor diversity in high-throughput single-cell sequencing data. DALI aims to support bioinformaticians with a functional toolbox, allowing seamless integration of multimodal scRNAseq and immune receptor profiling data generated through 10X Genomics Cell Ranger software. The R-based package builds further on workflows using the Seurat package and other existing tools for BCR/TCR analyses. In addition, DALI is designed to engage immunologists having limited coding experience with their data, using a browser-based interactive graphical user interface. The implementation of DALI can effectively lead to a two-way communication between wet-lab scientists and bioinformaticians to advance the analysis of complex datasets.",

    "abstract": "Magnesium plays a vital role in a large variety of biological processes. To model such processes by molecular dynamics simulations, researchers rely on accurate force field parameters for Mg2+ and water. OPC is one of the most promising water models yielding an improved description of biomolecules in water. The aim of this work is to provide force field parameters for Mg2+ that lead to accurate simulation results in combination with OPC water. Using twelve different Mg2+ parameter sets, that were previously optimized with different water models, we systematically assess the transferability to OPC based on a large variety of experimental properties. The results show that the Mg2+ parameters for SPC/E are transferable to OPC and closely reproduce the experimental solvation free energy, radius of the first hydration shell, coordination number, activity derivative, and binding affinity toward the phosphate oxygens on RNA. Two optimal parameter sets are presented: MicroMg yields water exchange in OPC on the microsecond timescale in agreement with experiments. NanoMg yields accelerated exchange on the nanosecond timescale and facilitates the direct observation of ion binding events for enhanced sampling purposes.",

    "abstract": "Diffraction anisotropy is a phenomenon that impacts more specifically membrane proteins, compared to soluble ones, but the reasons for this discrepancy remained unclear. Often, it is referred to a difference in resolution limits between highest and lowest diffraction limits as a signature for anisotropy. We show in this article that there is no simple correlation between anisotropy and difference in resolution limits, with notably a substantial number of structures displaying various anisotropy with no difference in resolution limits. We further investigated diffraction intensity profiles, and observed a peak centred on 4.9[A] resolution more predominant in membrane proteins. Since this peak is in the region corresponding to secondary structures, we investigated the influence of secondary structure ratio. We showed that secondary structure content has little influence on this profile, while secondary structure collinearity in membrane proteins correlate with a stronger peak. Finally, we could further show that the presence of this peak is linked to higher diffraction anisotropy.\n\nSynopsisMembrane protein diffraction anisotropy originates from a peak at 4.9 [A] resolution in intensity profiles, due to secondary structure collinearity.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), the most common histological subtype, accounts for 40% of all cases. While genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) recapitulate the histological progression and transcriptional evolution of human LUAD, they are slow and technically demanding. In contrast, cell line transplant models are fast and flexible, but are often derived from clonal idiosyncratic tumors that fail to capture the full spectrum of clinical disease. Organoid technologies provide a means to create next-generation cancer models that integrate the most relevant features of autochthonous and transplant-based systems, yet robust and faithful LUAD organoid platforms are currently lacking. Here, we describe optimized conditions to continuously expand murine alveolar type 2 cells (AT2), a prominent cell-of-origin for LUAD, in organoid culture. These organoids display canonical features of AT2 cells, including marker gene expression, the presence of lamellar bodies, and an ability to differentiate into the AT1 lineage. We used this system to develop flexible and versatile immunocompetent organoid-based models of KRAS and ALK-mutant LUAD. Notably, the resultant tumors closely resemble their autochthonous murine counterparts and human LUAD. In contrast to comparable organoid platforms, our system supports long-term maintenance of the AT2 cellular identity, providing unprecedented ease and reliability to study AT2 and LUAD biology in vitro and in vivo.",

    "abstract": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) ranks 6th in cancer incidence worldwide and has a five-year survival rate of only 63%. Immunotherapies - principally immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), such as anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies that restore endogenous antitumor T-cell immunity - offer the greatest promise for HNSCC treatment. Anti-PD-1 has been recently approved for first line treatment of recurrent and metastatic HNSCC; however less than 20% of patients show clinical benefit and durable responses. In addition, the clinical application of ICI has been limited by immune-related adverse events (irAEs) consequent to compromised peripheral immune tolerance. Although irAEs are often reversible, they can become severe, prompting premature therapy termination or becoming life-threatening. To address the irAEs inherent to systemic ICI therapy, we developed a novel, local delivery strategy based upon an array of soluble microneedles (MN). Using our recently reported syngeneic, tobacco-signature murine HNSCC model, we found that both systemic and local-MN anti-CTLA-4 therapy lead to >90% tumor response, which is dependent on CD8 T cells and conventional dendritic cell type 1 (cDC1). However, local-MN delivery limited the distribution of anti-CTLA-4 antibody from areas distal to draining lymphatic basins. Employing Foxp3-GFPDTR transgenic mice to interrogate irAEs in vivo, we found that local-MN delivery of anti-CTLA-4 protects animals from irAEs observed with systemic therapy. Taken together, our findings support the exploration of MN-intratumoral ICI delivery as a viable strategy for HNSCC treatment with reduced irAEs, and the opportunity to target cDC1s as part of multimodal treatment options to boost ICI therapy.",

Laboratory efforts to isolate metastatic cell populations have typically been confined to mouse models, which are time-consuming and expensive. Here, we present a model system based on xenografting zebrafish embryos to select for cells that are predisposed to progress through the early stages of metastasis. This model requires only 3-5 days to achieve distinct intravasation to the zebrafish circulatory system. The metastatic cells are easily tracked in real-time as they migrate, as well as isolated and propagated in vitro. Once expanded, molecular characterization of the serially derived invasive cell populations from the tails of the zebrafish accurately predicts genes, signaling pathways, protein-protein interactions, and differential splicing products that are important for an invasive phenotype. This zebrafish model therefore offers a high-throughput and robust method for identifying gene targets critical for cancer metastasis.",

    "abstract": "Hypothalamic AgRP/NPY neurons are key players in the control of feeding behavior. Ghrelin, a major hormone released under fasting conditions, activates orexigenic AgRP/NPY neurons to stimulate food intake and adiposity. However, cell-autonomous ghrelin-dependent signaling mechanisms in AgRP/NPY neurons remain poorly defined. Here we demonstrate that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID (CaMK1D), a genetic hot spot in type 2 diabetes, is activated in hypothalamus upon ghrelin stimulation and acts in AgRP neurons to promote ghrelin-dependent food intake. Global CaMK1D knockout mice are resistant to the orexigenic action of ghrelin, gain less body weight and are protected against high-fat diet-induced obesity. Deletion of CaMK1D in AgRP but not in POMC neurons is sufficient to recapitulate above phenotypes. Lack of CaMK1D attenuates phosphorylation of CREB and CREB-dependent expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides AgRP/NPY as well as the amount of AgRP fiber projections to the Paraventricular nucleus (PVN), while electrical activity of AgRP neurons and 5 AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling are unaffected. Hence, CaMK1D links ghrelin action to transcriptional control of orexigenic neuropeptide availability in AgRP neurons.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWhole-body deletion of CaMK1D in mice reduces food intake, ghrelin sensitivity and protects against obesity.\nC_LIO_LIAgRP/NPY neuron-specific deletion of CaMK1D reduces food intake, ghrelin sensitivity, energy expenditure and protects against obesity.\nC_LIO_LICaMK1D is dispensable for ghrelin-stimulated electrical activity of AgRP neurons and hypothalamic AMPK signaling.\nC_LIO_LICaMK1D controls phosphorylation of CREB and CREB-dependent expression of the orexigenic neuropeptides AgRP and NPY.\nC_LI\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=174 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/471546v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (46K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@40d7d7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@11a8c64org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1f6fad3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1cd5581_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

However, the function of SEC16B in vivo, especially in lipid metabolism, has not been investigated. Here we demonstrated that intestinal SEC16B is required for dietary lipid absorption in mice. We showed that Sec16b intestinal knockout (IKO) mice, especially female mice, were protected from HFD-induced obesity. Loss of SEC16B in intestine dramatically reduced postprandial serum triglyceride output upon intragastric lipid load or during overnight fasting and high-fat diet (HFD) refeeding. Further studies showed that intestinal SEC16B deficiency impaired apoB lipidation and chylomicron secretion.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we find that the m6A reader YTHDF2 is highly expressed in the mouse RGCs. Conditional knockout (cKO) of Ythdf2 in the retina leads to increased RGC dendrite branching, resulting in more synapses in the inner plexiform layer. Interestingly, the Ythdf2 cKO mice show improved visual acuity compared with control mice. We further demonstrate that Ythdf2 cKO in the retina protects RGCs from dendrite degeneration caused by the experimental acute glaucoma model. We identify the m6A-modified YTHDF2 target transcripts which mediate these effects. This study reveals mechanisms by which YTHDF2 restricts RGC dendrite development and maintenance. YTHDF2 and its target mRNAs might be valuable in developing new treatment approaches for glaucomatous eyes.\n\nImpact statementThe m6A reader YTHDF2 negatively regulates RGC dendrite branching through destabilizing its m6A-modified target mRNAs encoding proteins controlling dendrite development and maintenance.

    "abstract": "The peripheral branch of sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons regenerates readily after injury unlike their central branch in the spinal cord. However extensive regeneration and reconnection of sensory axons in the spinal cord can be driven by the expression of 9 integrin and its activator kindlin- 1(9k1), which enable axons to interact with tenascin-C. To elucidate the mechanisms and downstream pathways affected by activated integrin expression and central regeneration, we conducted transcriptomic analyses of DRG sensory neurons transduced with 9k1, and controls, with and without axotomy of the central branch. Expression of 9k1 without the central axotomy led to upregulation of a known PNS regeneration program, including many genes associated with peripheral nerve regeneration. Coupling 9k1 treatment with dorsal root axotomy led to extensive central axonal regeneration and caused expression of a distinctive CNS regeneration program, including genes associated with ubiquitination, autophagy, endoplasmic reticulum, trafficking, and signalling. Pharmacological inhibition of these processes blocked the regeneration of axons from DRGs and human iPS-derived sensory neurons, validating their causal contributions. This CNS regeneration- associated program showed little correlation with either embryonic development or PNS regeneration programs. Potential transcriptional drivers of this CNS program coupled to regeneration include Mef2a, Runx3, E2f4, Tfeb, Yy1. Signalling from integrins primes sensory neurons for regeneration, but their axon growth in the CNS is associated with a distinctive program that differs from that involved in PNS regeneration.",

    "abstract": "Coiled coil-forming M proteins of the widespread and potentially deadly bacterial pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes (Strep A) are immunodominant targets of opsonizing antibodies. However, antigenic sequence variability into >220 M types, as defined by the M protein hypervariable region (HVR), has been considered to limit its utility as a vaccine immunogen due to type-specificity in the antibody response. Surprisingly, a multi-HVR immunogen in clinical vaccine trials elicited M type cross-reactivity. The basis for this cross-reactivity is unknown but may be due in part to antibody recognition of a three-dimensional (3D) pattern conserved in many M protein HVRs that confers binding to human C4b-binding protein (C4BP). To test this hypothesis, we asked whether a single M protein immunogen carrying the 3D pattern would elicit cross-reactivity against other M types carrying the 3D pattern. We found that a 34-amino acid sequence of M2 protein bearing the 3D pattern retained full C4BP-binding capacity when fused to a coiled coil-stabilizing sequence from GCN4. This immunogen, called M2G, elicited cross-reactive antibodies against a number of M types that carry the 3D pattern but not against those that lack the 3D pattern. The M2G antiserum recognized M proteins as displayed natively on the Strep A surface, and promoted the opsonophagocytic killing of Strep A strains expressing these M proteins. As C4BP-binding is a conserved virulence trait of Strep A, targeting the 3D pattern may prove advantageous in vaccine design.",

At molecular level, the in vivo vB12 treatment let us to identify genes that were dysregulated by Tbx1 haploinsufficiency and rescued by treatment. We found that SLUG, encoded by the rescued gene Snai2, identified a population of mesodermal cells that was partially overlapping with but distinct from ISL1+ and TBX1+ populations. In addition, SLUG+ cells were mislocalized and had a greater tendency to aggregate in Tbx1+/- and Tbx1-/- embryos and vB12 treatment restore cellular distribution. Adjacent neural crest-derived mesenchymal cells, which do not express TBX1, were also affected, showing enhanced segregation from cardiopharyngeal mesodermal cells. We propose that TBX1 regulates cell distribution in core mesoderm and the arrangement of multiple lineages within the PhAp.",

    "abstract": "In the early stages of meiosis, maternal and paternal chromosomes pair with their homologous partner and recombine to ensure exchange of genetic information and proper segregation. These events can vary drastically between species and between males and females of the same species. In Drosophila, in contrast to females, males do not form synaptonemal complexes (SCs), do not recombine and have no crossing-over; yet, males are able to segregate their chromosomes properly. Here, we investigated the early steps of homologues pairing in Drosophila males. We found that homologues are not paired in germline stem cells (GSCs) and become paired in the mitotic region before meiotic entry, similarly to females. Surprisingly, male germline cells express SC proteins, which localize to centromeres and promote pairing. We further found that the SUN/KASH (LINC) complex and microtubules are required for homologues pairing as in females. Chromosome movements are however much slower than in females and we demonstrate that this slow dynamic is compensated in males by having longer cell cycles. In agreement, slowing down cell cycles was sufficient to rescue pairing-defective mutants in female meiosis. Our results demonstrate that although meiosis differs significantly between males and females, sex-specific cell cycle kinetics are integrated with similar molecular mechanisms to achieve proper homologues pairing.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWMacroH2A variants have been associated with tumor suppression through inhibition of proliferation and metastasis, as well as their role in cellular senescence. However, their role in regulating the dormant state of disseminated cancer cells (DCCs) remains unclear. Here we reveal that solitary dormant DCCs display increased levels of macroH2A variants in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma PDX models and patient samples compared to proliferating primary or metastatic lesions. We further demonstrate that microenvironmental and stress adaptive signals such as TGF{beta}2 and p38/{beta}, which induce DCC dormancy, upregulate macroH2A expression. Functionally, we find that overexpression of macroH2A variants is sufficient to induce tumor cells into dormancy and notably, inducible expression of the macroH2A2 variant suppresses the growth of DCCs into overt metastasis. However, this dormant state does not require well-characterized dormancy factors such as DEC2 and NR2F1, suggesting alternate pathways. Our transcriptomic analyses reveal that macroH2A2 overexpression inhibits E2F, RAS and MYC signaling programs, while upregulating inflammatory cytokines commonly secreted by senescent cells. Taken together, our results demonstrate that macroH2A2 enforces a stable dormant phenotype in DCCs by activating a select subset of dormancy and senescence genes that limit metastasis initiation.",

    "abstract": "Efficient production of biochemicals and proteins in cell factories frequently benefits from a two-stage bioprocess in which growth and production phases are decoupled. Here we describe a novel growth switch based on the permanent removal of the origin of replication (oriC) from the Escherichia coli chromosome. Without oriC, cells cannot initiate a new round of replication and they stop growing while their metabolism remains active. Our system relies on a serine recombinase from bacteriophage phiC31 whose expression is controlled by the temperature-sensitive cI857 repressor from phage lambda. Reporter protein expression in switched cells continues after cessation of growth, leading to protein levels up to five times higher compared to non-switching cells. Switching induces a unique physiological state that is different from both normal exponential and stationary phases. Switched cells remain in this state even when not growing, retain their protein synthesis capacity, and do not induce proteins associated with the stationary phase. Our switcher technology is potentially useful for a range of products and applicable in many bacterial species for decoupling growth and production.",

    "abstract": "Fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) is an aggressive liver cancer with no effective therapeutic options. The extracellular environment of FLC tumors is poorly characterized and may contribute to cancer growth and/or metastasis. To bridge this knowledge gap, we assessed pathways relevant to proteoglycans, a major component of the extracellular matrix. We first analyzed gene expression data from FLC and non-malignant liver tissue (n=27) to identify changes in glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis pathways and found that genes associated with production of chondroitin sulfate, but not other GAGs, are significantly increased by 8-fold. We then implemented a novel LC-MS/MS based method to quantify the abundance of different types of GAGs in patient tumors (n=16) and found that chondroitin sulfate is significantly more abundant in FLC tumors by 6-fold. Upon further analysis of GAG-associated proteins we found that versican (VCAN) expression is significantly up-regulated at the mRNA and protein levels, the latter of which was validated by immunohistochemistry. Finally, we performed single-cell assay for transposon-accessible chromatin-sequencing on FLC tumors (n=3), which revealed for the first time the different cell types in FLC tumors and also showed that VCAN is likely produced not only from FLC tumor epithelial cells but also activated stellate cells. Our results reveal a pathologic aberrancy in chondroitin (but not heparan) sulfate proteoglycans in FLC and highlight a potential role for activated stellate cells.\n\nSignificanceThis study leverages a multi-disciplinary approach, including state-of-the-art chemical analyses and cutting-edge single-cell genomic technologies, to identify for the first time a marked chondroitin sulfate aberrancy in fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) that could open novel therapeutic avenues in the future.",

    "abstract": "Galectins are mentioned in the literature as multifunctional molecules that participate in several biological processes such as adhesion, cell proliferation, and cycle, apoptosis, RNA processing, inflammatory process control, and reproductive physiological mechanisms. Galectin-1 has been referred to as a mediator involved in the prevention of early embryonic mortality in mammals. Exogenous GAL-1 (eGAL-1) can be found in Tolerana(R). The objective of the study was to evaluate whether eGAL-1 can increase the pregnancy rate when used in an AI procedure (in a complementary artificial insemination procedure, using a second AI gun). The pregnancy rate was determined by the pregnancy condition through an ultrasound exam performed 25 to 35 days after the fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) of breeding cows (n=3,469 beef cows). The efficacy of GAL-1 was evaluated by comparing the pregnancy rate of the two groups (Treatment and Control Groups) in 107 contemporary groups (YG) established by the created statistical model. Based on the obtained results, it can be confirmed that the correct administration of a single dose of eGAL-1 can increase the probability of obtaining pregnancy in beef cows by up to 8.68% (p < 0.0001). The recommendation of the use of eGAL-1 during the FTAI procedure was reasonable in the beef cattle AI routine. On average, the complete procedure, using eGAL-1, took about 10 {+/-} 5 seconds more time than the conventional procedure.",
