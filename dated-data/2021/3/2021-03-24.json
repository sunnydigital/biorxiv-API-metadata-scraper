    "abstract": "Yellow fever virus (YFV) is the agent of the most severe mosquito-borne disease in the tropics. Recently, Brazil suffered major YFV outbreaks with a high fatality rate affecting areas where the virus has not been reported for decades, consisting of urban areas where a large number of unvaccinated people live. We developed a machine learning framework combining three different algorithms (XGBoost, random forest and regularized logistic regression). This method was applied to 56 YFV sequences from human infections and 27 from non-human primate (NHPs) infections to investigate the presence of genetic signatures possibly related to disease severity (in human related sequences) and differences in the PCR cycle threshold (Ct) values (in NHP related sequences). Our analyses reveal four non-synonymous single nucleotide variations (SNVs) on sequences from human infections, in proteins NS3 (E614D), NS4a (I69V), NS5 (R727G, V643A) and six non-synonymous SNVs on NHP sequences, in proteins E (L385F), NS1 (A171V), NS3 (I184V) and NS5 (N11S, I374V, E641D). We performed comparative protein structural analysis on these SNVs, describing possible impacts on protein function. Despite the fact that the dataset is limited in size and that this study does not consider virus-host interactions, our work highlights the use of machine learning as a versatile and fast initial approach to genomic data exploration.\n\nImportanceYellow fever is responsible for 29-60 thousand deaths annually in South America and Africa and is the most severe mosquito-borne disease in the tropics. Given the range of clinical outcomes and the availability of YFV genomic data, the use of machine learning analysis promises to be a powerful tool in the investigation of genetic signatures that could impact disease severity and its potential of being reintroduced in an urban transmission cycle. This can assist in the search for biomarkers of severity as well as help elucidating variations in hosts Ct value. This work aims to propose a relatively fast and inexpensive computational analysis framework, which can be used as a real-time, innitial strategy associated with genomic surveillance to identify a set of single nucleotide variants putatively related to biological and clinical characteristics being observed.",

    "abstract": "The vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster is a pivotal model for invertebrate development, genetics, physiology, neuroscience, and disease. The whole family Drosophilidae, which contains over 4000 species, offers a plethora of cases for comparative and evolutionary studies. Despite a long history of phylogenetic inference, many relationships remain unresolved among the groups and genera in the Drosophilidae. To clarify these relationships, we first developed a set of new genomic markers and assembled a multilocus data set of 17 genes from 704 species of Drosophilidae. We then inferred well-supported group and species trees for this family. Additionally, we were able to determine the phylogenetic position of some previously unplaced species. These results establish a new framework for investigating the evolution of traits in fruit flies, as well as valuable resources for systematics.",

    "abstract": "In genetic association studies with common diseases, population stratification is a major source of confounding. Principle component regression (PCR) and linear mixed model (LMM) are two commonly used approaches to account for population stratification. Previous studies have shown that LMM can be interpreted as including all principle components (PCs) as random-effect covariates. However, including all PCs in LMM may inflate type I error in some scenarios due to redundancy, while including only a few pre-selected PCs in PCR may fail to fully capture the genetic diversity. Here, we propose a statistical method under the Bayesian framework, Bayestrat, that utilizes appropriate shrinkage priors to shrink the effects of non- or minimally confounded PCs and improve the identification of highly confounded ones. Simulation results show that Bayestrat consistently achieves lower type I error rates yet higher power, especially when the number of PCs included in the model is large. We also apply our method to two real datasets, the Dallas Heart Studies (DHS) and the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and demonstrate the superiority of Bayestrat over commonly used methods.",

    "abstract": "While expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) have been powerful in identifying susceptibility genes from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) findings, most trait-associated loci are not explained by eQTL alone. Alternative QTLs including DNA methylation QTL (meQTL) are emerging, but cell-type-specific meQTL using cells of disease origin has been lacking. Here we established an meQTL dataset using primary melanocytes from 106 individuals and identified 1,497,502 significant cis-meQTLs. Multi-QTL colocalization using meQTL, eQTL, and mRNA splice-junction QTL from the same individuals together with imputed methylome-wide and transcriptome-wide association studies identified susceptibility genes at 63% of melanoma GWAS loci. Among three molecular QTLs, meQTLs were the single largest contributor. To compare melanocyte meQTLs with those from malignant melanomas, we performed meQTL analysis on skin cutaneous melanomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 444). A substantial proportion of meQTL probes (45.9%) in primary melanocytes are preserved in melanomas, while a smaller fraction of eQTL genes is preserved (12.7%). Integration of melanocyte multi-QTL and melanoma meQTL identified candidate susceptibility genes at 72% of melanoma GWAS loci. Beyond GWAS annotation, meQTL-eQTL colocalization in melanocytes suggested that 841 unique genes potentially share a causal variant with a nearby methylation probe in melanocytes. Finally, melanocyte trans-meQTL identified a hotspot for rs12203592, a cis-eQTL of a transcription factor, IRF4, with 131 candidate target CpGs. Motif enrichment and IRF4 ChIPseq analysis demonstrated that these target CpGs are enriched in IRF4 binding sites, suggesting an IRF4-mediated regulatory network. Our study highlights the utility of cell-type-specific meQTL.",

    "abstract": "Condensins are molecular motors that compact DNA via linear translocation. In C. elegans, the X-chromosome harbors a specialized condensin that participates in dosage compensation (DC). Condensin DC is recruited to and spreads from a small number of recruit elements on the X-chromosome (rex) and is required for the formation of topologically associating domains (TADs). We take advantage of autosomes that are largely devoid of condensin DC and TADs to address how rex sites and condensin DC give rise to the formation of TADs. When an autosome and X-chromosome are physically fused, despite the spreading of condensin DC into the autosome, no TAD was created. Insertion of a strong rex on the X-chromosome results in the TAD boundary formation regardless of sequence orientation. When the same rex is inserted on an autosome, despite condensin DC recruitment, there was no spreading or features of a TAD. On the other hand, when a \"super rex\" composed of six rex sites or three separate rex sites are inserted on an autosome, recruitment and spreading of condensin DC led to formation of TADs. Therefore, recruitment to and spreading from rex sites are necessary and sufficient for recapitulating loop-anchored TADs observed on the X-chromosome. Together our data suggest a model in which rex sites are both loading sites and bidirectional barriers for condensin DC, a one-sided loop-extruder with movable inactive anchor.",

Our previous study shows that individual bees \"scent\" to emit pheromones and fan their wings to direct the signal flow, creating an efficient search and aggregation process. In this work, we introduce environmental stressors in the form of physical obstacles that partially block pheromone signals and prevent a wide open path to the queen. We employ machine learning methods to extract data from the experimental recordings, and show that in the presence of an obstacle that blocks most of the path to the queen, the bees need more time but can still effectively employ the collective scenting strategy to overcome the obstacle and aggregate around the queen. Further, we increase the complexity of the environment by presenting the bees with a maze to navigate to the queen. The bees require more time and exploration to form a more populated communication network. Overall, we show that given volatile pheromone signals and only local communication, the bees can collectively solve the swarming process in a complex unstructured environment with physical obstacles.",

A VHH issued from the screen against Tau of a synthetic phage-display library of humanized VHHs was selected for its capacity to bind Tau microtubule-binding domain, composing the core of Tau fibrils. This lead VHH was optimized to improve its biochemical properties and to act in the intracellular compartment, resulting in VHH Z70. VHH Z70 was more efficient than the lead to inhibit in vitro Tau aggregation in heparin-induced assays. Expression of VHH Z70 in a cellular model of Tau seeding also decreased the fluorescence-reported aggregation. Finally, intracellular expression of VHH Z70 in the brain of an established tauopathy mouse seeding model demonstrated its capacity to mitigate accumulation of pathological Tau. VHH Z70, by targeting Tau inside brain neurons, where most of the pathological Tau resides, provides a new tool to explore the optimal strategies of immunotherapy in tauopathies.",

    "abstract": "Aerosols dispersed and transmitted through the air (e.g., particulate matter pollution, bioaerosols) are ubiquitous and one of the leading causes of adverse health effects and disease transmission. A variety of sampling methods (e.g., filters, cyclones, impactors) have been developed to assess personal exposures. However, a gap still remains in the accessibility and ease-of-use of these technologies for people without experience or training in collecting airborne samples. Additionally, wet scrubbers (large non-portable industrial systems) utilize liquid sprays to remove aerosols from the air; the goal is to \"scrub\" (i.e., clean) the exhaust of industrial smokestacks, not collect the aerosols for analysis. Inspired by wet scrubbers, we developed a device fundamentally different from existing portable air samplers by using aerosolized microdroplets to capture aerosols in personal spaces (e.g., homes, offices, schools). Our aerosol-sampling device is the size of a small teapot, can be operated without specialized training, and features a winding flow path in a supersaturated relative humidity environment enabling droplet growth. The integrated open mesofluidic channels shuttle coalesced droplets to a collection chamber for subsequent sample analysis. Here, we present the experimental demonstration of aerosol capture into water droplets. Iterative study optimized the non-linear flow manipulating baffles and enabled an 83% retention of the aerosolized microdroplets in the confined volume of our device. As a proof-of-concept for aerosol capture into a liquid medium, 0.5-3 {micro}m model particles were used to evaluate aerosol capture efficiency. Finally, we demonstrate the device can capture and keep a bioaerosol (bacteriophage MS2) viable for downstream analysis.",

    "abstract": "Long-term behaviors of biochemical reaction networks (BRNs) are described by steady states in deterministic models and stationary distributions in stochastic models. Unlike deterministic steady states, stationary distributions capturing inherent fluctuations of reactions are extremely difficult to derive analytically due to the curse of dimensionality. Here, we develop a method to derive analytic stationary distributions from deterministic steady states by transforming BRNs to have a special dynamic property, called complex balancing. Specifically, we merge nodes and edges of BRNs to match in- and out-flows of each node. This allows us to derive the stationary distributions of a large class of BRNs, including autophosphorylation networks of EGFR, PAK1, and Aurora B kinase and a genetic toggle switch. This reveals the unique properties of their stochastic dynamics such as robustness, sensitivity and multi-modality. Importantly, we provide a user-friendly computational package, CASTANET, that automatically derives symbolic expressions of the stationary distributions of BRNs to understand their long-term stochasticity.",

    "abstract": "Brain activities, called brain rhythms, are the micro-level electrical signals (that is, Electroencephalogram or EEG) generated in our brain while we are performing a task. Even when we imagine a limb movement, it generates the same EEG signals called motor-imagery. Motor-imagery based Brain-computer Interface (BCI) provides a non-muscular means to connect the human brain with limbs through computer-based interpretations. The main aim of this paper is to find a suitable feature-set and a classifier to efficiently classify EEG signals into distinct motor-imagery brain-states. We propose to use sliding temporal window-based approaches for feature extraction from EEG and a mix-bagging classifier which is essentially a bagging-based ensemble of multiple types of learners for motor imagery EEG classification. We observe that mix-bagging with overlapping sliding window-based feature extraction achieves an accuracy of 91.43% on the BCI Competition II Dataset III. To reduce the feature size further, we use a fuzzy discernibility matrix that selects the most discriminative features instead of all the features. This additional feature selection strategy improves the classification accuracy to 92.14% and sets a new state-of-the art result on this dataset.",

Using a combined functional magnetic resonance imaging and working memory paradigm, we tested the hypothesis that the pattern of neural activation subserving working memory following TBI would interact with both task demands and specific working memory subcomponents: encoding, maintenance, and retrieval. Behaviourally, we found that working memory deficits were confined to the high cognitive load trials. Our results confirmed our key prediction. Overall, TBI participants showed reduced brain activity while performing the working memory task. However, interrogation of the subcomponents of working memory revealed a more nuanced pattern of activation. When we simply averaged across all task trials, regardless of cognitive load or subcomponent, TBI participants showed reduced neural activation. When examined more closely, patterns of brain activity following TBI were found to interact with both task demands and working memory subcomponent. Participants with TBI demonstrated an inability to appropriately modulate brain activity between low and high demand conditions necessary during encoding and maintenance stages. Therefore, we demonstrate that conclusions about aberrant neural processing are dependent upon the level of analysis and the extent to which general cognitive domains can be parcellated into its constituent parts.",

    "abstract": "Ostreococcus tauri is a ubiquitous marine pico-eukaryote that is susceptible to lysis upon infection by its species specific Ostreococcus tauri viruses (OtVs). In natural populations of O. tauri, costs of resistance are usually invoked to explain the persistence or reappearance of susceptible individuals in resistant populations. Given the low costs of resistance measured in laboratory experiments with the O. tauri/OtV system to date, the question remains of why susceptible individuals persist in the wild at all. Epidemiological models of host and pathogen population dynamics are one useful approach to understand the conditions that can allow the coexistence of susceptible and resistant hosts. We used a SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Resistant) model to investigate epidemiological dynamics under different laboratory culturing regimes that are commonly used in the O.tauri/OtV system. When taking into account serial transfer (i.e. batchcycle lengths) and dilution rates as well as different resistance costs, our model predicts that no susceptible cells should be detected under any of the simulated conditions - this is consistent with laboratory findings. We thus considered an alternative model that is not used in laboratory experiments, but which incorporates one key process in natural populations: host populations are periodically re-seeded with new infective viruses. In this model, susceptible individuals re-occurred in the population, despite low costs of resistance. This suggests that periodic attack by new viruses, rather than (or in addition to) costs of resistance, may explain the high proportion of susceptible hosts in natural populations, and underlie the discrepancy between laboratory studies and observations of fresh isolates.\n\nImportanceIn natural samples of Ostreococcus sp. and its associated viruses, susceptible hosts are common. However, in laboratory experiments, fully resistant host populations readily and irreversibly evolve. Laboratory experiments are powerful methods for studying process because they offer a stripped-down simplification of a complex system, but this simplification may be an oversimplification for some questions. For example, laboratory and field systems of marine microbes and their viruses differ in population sizes and dynamics, mixing or migration rates, and species diversity, all of which can dramatically alter process outcomes. We demonstrate the utility of using epidemiological models to explore experimental design and to understand mechanisms underlying host-virus population dynamics. We highlight that such models can be used to form strong, testable hypotheses about which key elements of natural systems need to be included in laboratory systems to make them simplified, rather than oversimplified, versions of the processes we use them to study.",

    "abstract": "Mating-type (P or M) of fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is determined by the transcriptionally active mat1 cassette and is switched by gene conversion using a donor, either mat2 or mat3, located in an adjacent heterochromatin region (mating-type switching; MTS). In the process, heterochromatic donors of genetic information are selected based on the P or M cell type and on the action of two recombination enhancers, SRE2 promoting the use of mat2-P and SRE3 promoting the use of mat3-M, leading to replacement of the content of the expressed mat1 cassette. Recently, we found that the histone H3K4 methyltransferase complex Set1C participates in donor selection, raising the question of how a complex best known for its effects in euchromatin controls recombination in heterochromatin. Here, we report that the histone H2BK119 ubiquitin ligase complex HULC functions with Set1C in MTS, as mutants in the shf1, brl1, brl2 and rad6 genes showed defects similar to Set1C mutants and belonged to the same epistasis group as set1{Delta}. Moreover, using H3K4R and H2BK119R histone mutants and a Set1-Y897A catalytic mutant indicated that ubiquitylation of histone H2BK119 by HULC and methylation of histone H3K4 by Set1C are functionally coupled in MTS. Cell-type biases in MTS in these mutants suggested that HULC and Set1C inhibit the use of the SRE3 recombination enhancer in M cells, thus favoring SRE2 and mat2-P. Consistently, imbalanced switching in the mutants was traced to compromised association of the directionality factor Swi6 with the recombination enhancers in M cells. Based on their known effects at other chromosomal locations, we speculate that HULC and Set1C might control nucleosome mobility and strand invasion near the SRE elements. In addition, we uncovered distinct effects of HULC and Set1C on histone H3K9 methylation and gene silencing, consistent with additional functions in the heterochromatic domain.",

Xylella fastidiosa subspecies fastidiosa causes disease in grapevines (Pierces disease of grapevines, PD), a current problem in the United States (US), Spain, and Taiwan. We studied PD-causing subsp. fastidiosa populations and compared the genome sequences of 33 isolates found in Central Taiwan with 171 isolates from the US and two from Spain.\n\nPhylogenetic relationships, haplotype network, and genetic diversity analyses confirm that subsp. fastidiosa was recently introduced into Taiwan from the Southeast US (i.e., the PD-I lineage in Georgia based on available data). Recent core genome recombination events were detected among introduced subsp. fastidiosa isolates in Taiwan and contributed to the development of genetic diversity, particularly in the Houli District of Taichung City in Central Taiwan. Unexpectedly, despite comprehensive sampling of all regions with high PD incidences in Taiwan, the genetic diversity observed include contributions through recombination from unknown donors, suggesting that higher diversity exists in the region. Nevertheless, no recombination event was detected between X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa and the endemic sister species Xylella taiwanensis. In summary, this study improved our understanding of the genetic diversity of PD-causing subsp. fastidiosa after invasion to a new region.",

    "abstract": "Elaeidobius kamerunicus is the main insect pollinator for oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) worldwide. One of the main reason E. kamerunicus attracted to oil palm inflorescences is estragole, a volatile organic compound released by the oil palm inflorescences during anthesis stage. However, the amount of estragole released from the oil palm inflorescence is varied due to the influence of abiotic and biotic factors and is seen to have an impact on E. kamerunicus pollination activity on the oil palm. To evaluate the responses of E. kamerunicus, different types (wild and reared) and sex (male and female) of E. kamerunicus were exposed to different concentrations (1, 5, 10, 30, 50, 70, 100, 150 and 200 ppm) of commercial estragole using four-arm olfactometer. Results showed that E. kamerunicus significantly preferred 100 ppm of estragole compared to other concentration (F = 139.81; d.f. = 9; P < 0.05). A significant interaction was also recorded between estragole concentrations and sexes of E. kamerunicus (F = 3.91; d.f. = 9; P < 0.05) where male E. kamerunicus was found to be more responsive to 100 ppm of estragole compared female E. kamerunicus. The E. kamerunicus responses to estragole is in line with the increase of estragole concentration up to 100 ppm. However, the response of E. kamerunicus was significantly decreased after the concentration value. The result of this study can be a good platform for future references since the estragole compound plays a significant role in oil palms flower pollination by E. kamerunicus. The factor of type and sexes of E. kamerunicus did not affect the preferences which indicated that E. kamerunicus reared in the laboratory have the potential to be released into the oil palm plantation area to overcome the problem of pollination.",

    "abstract": "Analyzing human motion is essential for diagnosing movement disorders and guiding rehabilitation interventions for conditions such as osteoarthritis, stroke, and Parkinsons disease. Optical motion capture systems are the current standard for estimating kinematics but require expensive equipment located in a predefined space. While wearable sensor systems can estimate kinematics in any environment, existing systems are generally less accurate than optical motion capture. Further, many wearable sensor systems require a computer in close proximity and rely on proprietary software, making it difficult for researchers to reproduce experimental findings. Here, we present OpenSenseRT, an open-source and wearable system that estimates upper and lower extremity kinematics in real time by using inertial measurement units and a portable microcontroller. We compared the OpenSenseRT system to optical motion capture and found an average RMSE of 4.4 degrees across 5 lower-limb joint angles during three minutes of walking (n = 5) and an average RMSE of 5.6 degrees across 8 upper extremity joint angles during a Fugl-Meyer task (n = 5). The open-source software and hardware are scalable, tracking between 1 and 14 body segments, with one sensor per segment. Kinematics are estimated in real-time using a musculoskeletal model and inverse kinematics solver. The computation frequency, depends on the number of tracked segments, but is sufficient for real-time measurement for many tasks of interest; for example, the system can track up to 7 segments at 30 Hz in real-time. The system uses off-the-shelf parts costing approximately $100 USD plus $20 for each tracked segment. The OpenSenseRT system is accurate, low-cost, and simple to replicate, enabling movement analysis in labs, clinics, homes, and free-living settings.",

    "abstract": "Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease with a wide range of clinical manifestations. Multiple aspects of the Leishmania-host interaction, such as genetic factors and modulation of microbicidal functions in host cells, influence pathogenesis, disease severity and treatment outcome. How do scientists contend with this complexity? Here, we work towards representing detailed, contextual knowledge on Leishmania-host interactions in the Reactome pathway database to facilitate the extraction of novel mechanistic insights from existing datasets. The Reactome database uses a hierarchy of abstractions that allows for the incorporation of detailed contextual knowledge on biological processes matched to differentially expressed genes. It also includes tools for enhanced over-representation analysis that exploits this extra information. We conducted a systematic curation of published studies documenting different aspects of the Leishmania-host interaction. The \"Leishmania infection pathway\" included four sub-pathways: phagocytosis, killing mechanisms, cell recruitment, and Leishmania parasite growth and survival. As proof-of-principle of the usefulness of the released pathway, we used it to analyze two previously released transcriptomic datasets of human and murine macrophages infected with Leishmania. Our results provide insights on the participation of ADORA2B signaling pathway in the modulation of IL10 and IL6 in infected macrophages. This work opens the way for other researchers to contribute to, and make use of, the Reactome database.\n\nImportanceLeishmaniasis is a neglected disease infectious disease which affects more than 1.5 million people annually. Many researchers in the field apply -omic technologies to dissect the basis of clinical and therapeutic outcomes and access drug targetable features in the host-parasite interaction, among others. However, getting mechanistic insights from -omics data to such end is not an easy task. The most common approach is to use the -omics data to inquire pathways databases. The retrieved list of pathways often contains vague names that lack the biological context. In this study, we worked to create the Leishmania infection pathway in the Reactome database. With two practical examples from transcriptomics and microarray data, we demonstrated how this pathway facilitates the analysis of such data. In both datasets, we found a common mechanism of IL10 and IL6 production that the authors did not advert in their previous analysis, providing proof-of-principle of the tools enhanced potential for knowledge extraction. Leishmania infection pathway is in its first version, and must be expanded to cover the current knowledge base of the Leishmania-host interaction. We strongly encourage contributions from domain experts for the completion of Leishmania infection pathways.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities in the airways of persons with CF (pwCF) are variable, may include genera that are not typically associated with CF, and their composition can be difficult to correlate with long-term disease outcomes. Leveraging two large datasets characterizing sputum communities of 167 pwCF and associated metadata, we identify five bacterial community types. These communities explain 24% of the variability in lung function in this cohort, far more than single factors like Simpson diversity, which explains only 4%. Subjects with Pseudomonas-dominated communities tended to be older and have reduced percent predicted FEV1 (ppFEV1) than subjects with Streptococcus-dominated communities, consistent with previous findings. To assess the predictive power of these five communities in a longitudinal setting, we used random forests to classify 346 additional samples from 24 subjects observed 8 years on average in a range of clinical states. Subjects with mild disease were more likely to be observed at baseline, that is, not in the context of a pulmonary exacerbation, and community structure in these subjects was more self-similar over time, as measured by Bray-Curtis distance. Interestingly, we found that subjects with mild disease were more likely to remain in a mixed Pseudomonas community, providing some support for the climax-attack model of the CF airway. In contrast, patients with worse outcomes were more likely to show shifts among community types. Our results suggest that bacterial community instability may be a risk factor for lung function decline and indicates the need to better understand factors that drive shifts in community composition.",

Despite these efforts, SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unmanageable in some parts of the world. Due to inherent mutability of RNA viruses, it is not surprising that the SARS-CoV-2 genome has been continuously evolving since its emergence. Recently, four functionally distinct variants, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1 and CAL.20C, have been identified, and they appear to more infectious and transmissible than the original (Wuhan-Hu-1) virus. Here we provide evidence based upon a combination of bioinformatics and structural approaches that can explain the higher infectivity of the new variants. Our results show that the greater infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV can be attributed to a combination of several factors, including alternate receptors. Additionally, we show that new SARS-CoV-2 variants emerged in the background of D614G in Spike protein and P323L in RNA polymerase. The correlation analyses showed that all mutations in specific variants did not evolve simultaneously. Instead, some mutations evolved most likely to compensate for the viral fitness.",

    "abstract": "As one of the three mammalian gasotransmitters, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) plays a major role in maintaining physiological homeostasis. Endogenously produced H2S plays numerous beneficial roles including mediating vasodilation and conferring neuroprotection. Due to its high membrane permeability, exogenously produced H2S originating from the gut microbiota can also influence human physiology and is implicated in reducing intestinal mucosal integrity and potentiating genotoxicity and is therefore a potential target for therapeutic interventions. Gut microbial H2S production is often attributed to dissimilatory sulfate reducers such as Desulfovibrio and Bilophila species. However, an alternative source for H2S production, cysteine degradation, is present in gut microbes, but the genes responsible for cysteine degradation have not been systematically annotated in gut microbes. To better understand the potential for H2S production via cysteine degradation by the human gut microbiome, we performed a comprehensive search for genes encoding cysteine-degrading genes in 4,644 bacterial genomes from the Unified Human Gastrointestinal Genome (UHGG) catalogue. We identified 407 gut bacterial species as putative cysteine degrading bacteria, 328 of which have not been previously implicated in H2S production. We identified the presence of at least one putative cysteine degrading bacteria in metagenomic data of 100% of 6,644 healthy subjects and the expression of cysteine-degrading genes in metatranscriptomics data of 100% of 59 samples. Additionally, putative cysteine-degrading bacteria are more abundant than sulfate reducing bacteria (p<2.2e-16). Overall, this study improves our understanding of the capacity for H2S production by the human gut microbiome and may help to inform interventions to therapeutically modulate gut microbial H2S production.",

    "abstract": "Viral proteins are known to be methylated by host protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) playing critical roles during viral infections. Herein, we show that PRMT1 methylates SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein at residues R95 and R177 within RGG/RG sequences. Arginine methylation of N protein was confirmed by immunoblotting viral proteins extracted from SARS-CoV-2 virions isolated by cell culture. We demonstrate that arginine methylation of N protein is required for its RNA binding capacity, since treatment with a type I PRMT inhibitor (MS023) or substitution of R95K or R177K inhibited interaction with the 5-UTR of the SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA. We defined the N interactome in HEK293 cells with or without MS023 treatment and identified PRMT1 and many of its RGG/RG substrates including the known interactor, G3BP1, and other components of stress granules (SG). Methylation of N protein at R95 regulates another function namely its property to suppress the formation of SGs. MS023 treatment or R95K substitution blocked N-mediated suppression of SGs. Also, the co-expression of methylarginine reader TDRD3 quenched N-mediated suppression of SGs in a dose-dependent manner.

We study a class of processes and associated distributions that emerge from a bursty promoter model coupled to a path graph of downstream mRNA splicing, and more generally examine the behavior of finite-activity jump drivers coupled to a directed acyclic graph of splicing with one or more roots. These solutions provide full time-dependent joint distributions for an arbitrary number of species, offering qualitative and quantitative insights about how splicing can regulate expression dynamics. Finally, we derive a set of quantitative constraints on the minimum complexity necessary to reproduce gene co-expression patterns using synchronized burst models.

Here we sought to determine the role of macrophages in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) using a syngeneic model that reflected the mutational landscape of the disease. A transcriptomic analysis of CRPC tumors following macrophage depletion revealed lower molecular signatures for steroid and bile acid synthesis, indicating potential perturbation of cholesterol metabolism. Since cholesterol is the precursor of the five major classes of steroid hormones, we reasoned that macrophages were regulating androgen biosynthesis within the prostate tumor microenvironment. Indeed, macrophage depletion reduced the levels of androgens within prostate tumors and restricted androgen receptor (AR) nuclear localization in vitro and in vivo. Macrophages were cholesterol rich and had the ability to transfer cholesterol to tumor cells in vitro, and AR nuclear translocation was inhibited by activation of Liver X Receptor (LXR)-{beta}, the master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Finally, combining macrophage depletion with androgen deprivation therapy increased survival, supporting the therapeutic potential of targeting macrophages in CRPC.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundRND efflux pumps are important mediators of antibiotic resistance. RND pumps including the principal multidrug-efflux pump AcrAB-TolC in Salmonella, are tripartite systems, with an inner membrane RND-transporter, a periplasmic adaptor protein (PAP) and an outer membrane factor (OMF). We previously identified the residues required for binding between the PAP AcrA and the RND-transporter AcrB and have demonstrated that PAPs can function with non-cognate transporters. AcrE and AcrD/AcrF are homologues of AcrA and AcrB, respectively. Here, we show that AcrE can interact with AcrD, which does not possess its own PAP, and establish that the residues previously identified in AcrB-binding are also involved in AcrD-binding.\n\nMethodsThe acrD and acrE genes were expressed into a strain lacking acrABDEF ({Delta}3RND). PAP residues involved in promiscuous interactions were predicted based on previously defined PAP-RND interactions and corresponding mutations generated in acrA and acrE. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the mutant strains was determined.\n\nResultsCo-expression of acrD and acrE significantly decreased susceptibility of the {Delta}3RND strain to AcrD substrates showing that AcrE can form a functional complex with AcrD. The substrate profile of Salmonella AcrD differed from that of E. coli AcrD. Mutations targeting the previously defined PAP-RND interaction sites in AcrA/AcrE impaired efflux of AcrD-dependent substrates.\n\nConclusionsThese data indicate that AcrE forms an efflux-competent pump with AcrD and thus presents an alternative PAP for this pump. Mutagenesis of the conserved RND-binding sites validates the interchangeability of AcrA and AcrE, highlighting them as potential drug targets for efflux inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Biological nitrogen fixation is a major factor contributing to microbial primary productivity in the open ocean. The current view depicts a few cyanobacterial diazotrophs as the most relevant marine nitrogen fixers, whereas heterotrophic diazotrophs are more diverse and considered to have lower impacts on the nitrogen balance. Here, we used 891 Tara Oceans metagenomes to create a manually curated, non-redundant genomic database corresponding to free-living, as well as filamentous, colony-forming, particle-attached and symbiotic bacterial and archaeal populations occurring in the surface of five oceans and two seas. Notably, the database provided the genomic content of eight cyanobacterial diazotrophs including Trichodesmium populations and a newly discovered population similar to Richelia, as well as 40 heterotrophic bacterial diazotrophs organized into three main functional groups that considerably expand the known diversity of abundant marine nitrogen fixers compared to previous genomic surveys. Critically, these 48 populations may account for more than 90% of cells containing known nifH genes and occurring in the sunlit ocean, suggesting that the genomic characterization of the most abundant marine diazotrophs may be nearing completion. The newly identified heterotrophic bacterial diazotrophs are widespread, express their nifH genes in situ, and co-occur under nitrate-depleted conditions in large size fractions where they might form aggregates providing the low-oxygen microenvironments required for nitrogen fixation. Most significantly, we found heterotrophic bacterial diazotrophs to be more abundant than cyanobacterial diazotrophs in most metagenomes from the open oceans and seas. This large-scale environmental genomic survey emphasizes the considerable potential of heterotrophs in the marine nitrogen balance.",

Here, we describe the dynamics of a single annual cycle (2018-19) of phyto- and bacterioplankton (abundances, pigments and productivity) in relation to the physical and chemical conditions in the photic water column at an offshore EMS site (Station THEMO-2, [~]1,500m depth, 50km offshore). We show that phytoplankton biomass (as chlorophyll a), primary and bacterial productivity differed between the mixed winter (January-April) and the thermally stratified (May-December) periods. Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus numerically dominated the picophytoplankton populations, with each clade revealing different temporal and depth changes indicative to them, while pico-eukaryotes (primarily haptophytes) were less abundant, yet likely contributed significant biomass. Estimated primary productivity ([~]32 gC m-2 y-1) was lower compared with other well-studied oligotrophic locations, including the north Atlantic and Pacific (BATS and HOT observatories), the western Mediterranean (DYFAMED observatory) and the Red Sea, and was on-par with the ultra-oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre. In contrast, integrated bacterial production ([~]11 gC m-2 y-1) was similar to other oligotrophic locations. Phytoplankton seasonal dynamics were similar to those at BATS and the Red Sea, suggesting an observable effect of winter mixing in this ultra-oligotrophic location. These results highlight the ultra-oligotrophic conditions in the EMS and provide, for the first time in this region, a full-year baseline and context to ocean observatories in the region.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBacterioplankton dynamics were assessed monthly in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea\nC_LIO_LISmall-sized picophytoplankton numerically dominated the phytoplankton community\nC_LIO_LISeasonal phytoplankton dynamics are similar to BATS and Red Sea, but not to HOT\nC_LIO_LIAnnual primary productivity is among the lowest in the worlds oceans\nC_LIO_LIBacterial to primary production ratio is higher than most oligotrophic seas\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "RNA viruses exist as genetically heterogeneous populations due to high mutation rates and many of these mutations reduce fitness and/or replication speed. However, it is unknown whether mutations can increase replication speed of a virus already well adapted to replication in cultured cells. By sequentially passaging coxsackievirus B3 in cultured cells and collecting the very earliest progeny, we selected for increased replication speed. We found that a single mutation in a viral capsid protein, VP1-F106L, was sufficient for the fast-replication phenotype. Characterization of this mutant revealed quicker genome release during entry compared to wild-type virus, highlighting a previously unappreciated infection barrier. However, this mutation also reduced capsid stability in vitro and reduced replication and pathogenesis in mice. These results reveal a tradeoff between overall replication speed and fitness. Importantly, this approach-- selecting for the earliest viral progeny--could be applied to a variety of viral systems and has the potential to reveal unanticipated inefficiencies in viral replication cycles.\n\nSignificanceViruses have characteristic replication speeds within a given cell type. Many factors can slow the rate of viral replication, including attenuating mutations and host antiviral responses. However, it has been unclear whether it would be possible to \"speed up\" a virus that already replicates efficiently in a specific cell type. Here, we selected for a mutant coxsackievirus with enhanced replication speed by sequentially harvesting the very earliest progeny in multiple rounds of selection. A single mutation conferred the fast replication phenotype. While this mutant virus has enhanced replication in cultured cells due to faster genome uncoating, it was attenuated in mice. These results highlight selective pressures that shape viral populations in different environments.",

    "abstract": "Genetic variation among bacterial strains can contribute to heterogeneity in the severity of chronic inflammatory diseases 1,2, but the degree of variation created by de novo mutation during colonization is not well understood. The inflamed skin of people with atopic dermatitis (AD) is frequently colonized with Staphylococcus aureus, an opportunistic pathogen associated with both asymptomatic colonization of nasal passages and invasive disease 3-6. While genetic risk and barrier disruption are critical to AD initiation 7,8, S. aureus colonization is thought to worsen disease severity by promoting skin damage9 1,4,5,10. Here we show, from tracking 23 children treated for AD over 9 months, that S. aureus adapts via de novo mutations during colonization. Patients S. aureus populations are typically dominated by a single lineage, with infrequent invasion by distant lineages. Variants emerge within each lineage with mutation accumulation rates similar to S. aureus in other contexts. Some of these variants replace their ancestors across the body within months, with signatures of adaptive, rather than neutral, forces. Most strikingly, the capsule synthesis gene capD obtained four parallel mutations within one patient and was involved in mutational sweeps in multiple patients. We confirm that selection for capD negativity is common in AD, but not in other contexts, via reanalysis of public S. aureus genomes from 276 people. Our finding of disease-specific selection raises the possibility that adaptation of pathobionts during colonization prolongs the positive feedback cycle of inflammation.",

Hepatocyte lipotoxicity is one of the main pathogenic factors of liver fibrosis and NASH. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating this process are poorly understood. The main aim of this study was to dissect transcriptional mechanisms regulated by lipotoxicity in hepatocytes. We achieved this aim by combining transcriptomic, proteomic and chromatin accessibility analyses from human liver and mouse hepatocytes. This integrative approach revealed several transcription factor networks deregulated by NASH and lipotoxicity. To validate these predictions, genetic deletion of the transcription factors MAFK and TCF4 was performed, resulting in hepatocytes that were better protected against saturated fatty acid oversupply. MAFK- and TCF4-regulated gene expression profiles suggest a mitigating effect against cell stress, while promoting cell survival and growth. Moreover, in the context of lipotoxicity, some MAFK and TCF4 target genes were to the corresponding differentially regulated transcripts in human liver fibrosis. Collectively, our findings comprehensively profile the transcriptional response to lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, revealing new molecular insights and providing a valuable resource for future endeavours to tackle the molecular mechanisms of NASH.",

Knowing the structural information and binding pattern between drug target and discovery candidates greatly increases the possibility of success. With the cryo-EM resolution revolution and rapid development of computational software, we have evaluated and integrated different tools in structural biology and the computation field and established a highly cost-effective platform, which allows us to obtain fast and accurate structural information for biologics projects with a close to 100% success rate and as fast as weeks turn-around time. Here we report four case studies selected from over 40 different protein structures and share how we integrate cryo-EM structure determination, computational structure modeling, and molecular dynamics simulation. With proper decision making and strategic planning, the platform allows us to obtain quality results within days to weeks, including sub-100 kDa complexes which are usually considered as a challenge due to their small size. Our utilization of this differential approach and use of multiple software packages, allows to manage priorities and resources to achieve goals quickly and efficiently. We demonstrate how to effectively overcome particle orientation bias by altering complex composition. In several of our examples, we use glycan density to facilitate interpretation of low-resolution 3D reconstruction and epitope mapping.

However, scRNA-seq requires lysing cells, which makes it impossible to link the individual cells to downstream molecular and phenotypic states. Here, we established Live-seq, an approach for single-cell transcriptome profiling that preserves cell viability during RNA extraction using fluidic force microscopy. Based on cell division, functional responses and whole-cell transcriptome read-outs, we show that Live-seq does not induce major cellular perturbations and therefore can function as a transcriptomic recorder. We demonstrate this recording capacity by preregistering the transcriptomes of individual macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells that were subsequently subjected to time-lapse imaging after lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. This enabled the unsupervised, genome-wide ranking of genes based on their ability to impact macrophage LPS response heterogeneity, revealing basal NFKBIA expression level and cell cycle state as major phenotypic determinants. Furthermore, we show that Live-seq can be used to sequentially profile the transcriptomes of individual macrophages before and after stimulation with LPS, thus enabling the direct mapping of a cells trajectory. Live-seq can address a broad range of biological questions by transforming scRNA-seq from an end-point to a temporal analysis approach.",

    "abstract": "In eukaryotes, chromatin binding to the inner nuclear membrane (INM) and nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) contributes to spatial organization of the genome and epigenetic programs important for gene expression. In mitosis, chromatin-nuclear envelope (NE) interactions are lost and then formed again as sister chromosomes segregate to post-mitotic nuclei. Investigating these processes in S. cerevisiae, we identified temporally and spatially controlled phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation events that positively regulate post-metaphase chromatin association with the NE. Our work establishes a phosphorylation-mediated targeting mechanism of the SUMO ligase Siz2 to the INM during anaphase, where Siz2 binds to and SUMOylates the VAP protein Scs2. The recruitment of Siz2 through Scs2 is further responsible for a wave of SUMOylation along the INM that supports the assembly and anchorage of subtelomeric chromatin at the INM and localization of an active gene (INO1) to NPCs during the later stages of mitosis and into G1-phase.",

    "abstract": "RNA silencing is a conserved mechanism in eukaryotes and is involved in development, heterochromatin maintenance and defense against viruses. In plants, ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) protein plays a central role in both microRNA (miRNA) and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-directed silencing and its expression is regulated at multiple levels. Here, we report that the F-box protein FBW2 targets proteolysis of AGO1 by a CDC48-mediated mechanism. We found that FBW2 assembles an SCF complex that recognizes the MID-PIWI domain of AGO1 and requires its C-terminal domain containing a GW motif for AGO1 turnover. We showed that FBW2 prefers the unloaded and some mutated forms of AGO1 protein. While FBW2 loss of function does not lead to strong growth or developmental defects, it significantly increases RNA silencing activity. Interestingly, under conditions in which small RNA production or accumulation is affected, the failure to degrade AGO1 in fbw2 mutants becomes more deleterious for the plant. Hence, the non-degradable AGO1 protein assembles high molecular weight complexes and binds illegitimate small RNA leading to the cleavage of new target genes that belong to stress responses and cellular metabolic processes. Therefore, the control of AGO1 homeostasis by ubiquitin ligases plays an important role in quality control to avoid off-target cleavage.",

    "abstract": "Thrombosis and inflammation are intimately linked and synergistically contribute to the pathogenesis of a number of vascular diseases. On a cellular level, while the platelet is central to thrombus formation as well as an active mediator of inflammation, the molecular mechanisms of cross-talk between thrombosis and inflammation remain elusive. High-Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1) is an inflammatory regulator that also stimulates platelet activation through its interaction with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). However, it remains unclear whether cross-talk between HMGB1 and traditional thrombotic agonists exists to modulate platelet activation. Using isolated human platelets, we tested whether HMGB1 treatment affects platelet activation mediated by traditional agonists. We found that HMGB1 enhances ADP-mediated platelet activation, but not platelet activation stimulated by thrombin or collagen. Further, inhibition of the canonical ADP purinergic P2Y12 receptor attenuates HMGB1-dependent platelet activation. Mechanistically, we discovered that HMGB1 activates platelet surface TLR4 to release ADP from the platelet and concomitantly increase the localization of P2Y12 on the platelet membrane. These data demonstrate that ADP-dependent P2Y12 activation contributes to HMGB1 mediated platelet activation, while HMGB1 primes platelets for an enhanced activation response to ADP. These novel findings further our understanding of thrombo-inflammatory signaling and provide new insight for therapeutic P2Y12 inhibition.\n\nKey PointsO_LIHMGB1 enhances ADP-mediated platelet activation but not platelet activation stimulated by collagen or thrombin.\nC_LIO_LIHMGB1 stimulates platelet ADP release and increases platelet surface localization of P2y12 receptors via TLR4-dependent mechanism(s).\nC_LI\n\nVisual Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=163 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/436776v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (12K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17a31c0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@158391corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10d78a0org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@16a6a8f_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Caption: HMGB1 activates TLR4 to activate platelets, release platelet ADP, and upregulate P2Y12 at the platelet surface.\n\nC_FIG",

    "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a common malignant tumor, is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class of non-coding RNA, have been reported to be involved in the etiology of various malignancy. However, the functions of circRNAs in HCC remain unclear. In this study, through mining the RNA sequencing databases from GEO datasets and subsequent experimental verification, we identified that hsa_circ_0000384 (circMRPS35) was highly expressed in HCC. Knockdown of circMRPS35 suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, clone formation and cell cycle of HCC cell lines both in vitro and in a xenograft mouse model. Mechanically, circMRPS35 sponged microRNA-148a-3p (miR-148a), which in turn regulated STX3-PTEN axis. Surprisingly, we detected a peptide encoded by circMRPS35 (circMRPS35-168aa), which was significantly induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and promoted cisplatin resistance in HCC cells. These results demonstrated that circMRPS35 might be a novel factor in HCC progress, and has a great potential as a new diagnosis and therapeutic target for treatment of HCC.",

Differentiation of hPSCs through the authentic route, via an LP-osteochondral progenitor (OCP), may aid understanding of human cartilage development and the generation of effective cell therapies for osteoarthritis. We refined our existing chondrogenic protocol, incorporating knowledge from development and other studies to produce a LP-OCP from which prechondrocytes- and preosteoblast-like cells can be produced. Results show the formation of an OCP, which can be further driven to prechondrocytes and preosteoblasts. Prechondrocytes cultured in pellets produced cartilage like matrix with lacunae and superficial flattened cells expressing lubricin. Additionally, preosteoblasts were able to generate a mineralised structure. This protocol can therefore be used to further investigate cartilage development and in the development of joint cartilage for potential treatments.",

    "abstract": "Cichlid fish of the genus Oreochromis form the basis of the global tilapia aquaculture and fisheries industry. Non-native farmed tilapia populations are known to be widely distributed across Africa and to hybridize with native Oreochromis species. However, many species are difficult to distinguish morphologically, hampering attempts to maintain good quality farmed strains or to identify pure populations of native species. Here, we describe the development of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping panel from whole-genome resequencing data that enables targeted species identification in Tanzania. We demonstrate that an optimized panel of 96 genome-wide SNPs based on FST outliers performs comparably to whole genome resequencing in distinguishing species and identifying hybrids. We also show this panel outperforms microsatellite-based and phenotype-based classification methods. Case studies indicate several locations where introduced aquaculture species have become established in the wild, threatening native Oreochromis species. The novel SNP markers identified here represent an important resource for assessing broodstock purity and helping to conserve unique endemic biodiversity, and in addition potentially for assessing broodstock purity in hatcheries.",

    "abstract": "The maintenance of genomic stability requires the coordination of multiple cellular tasks upon the appearance of DNA lesions. RNA editing, the post-transcriptional sequence alteration of RNA, has a profound effect on cell homeostasis, but its implication in the response to DNA damage was not previously explored. Here we show that, in response to DNA breaks, an overall change of the Adenosine-to-Inosine RNA editing is observed, a phenomenon we call the RNA Editing DAmage Response (REDAR). REDAR relies on the checkpoint kinase ATR and the recombination factor CtIP. Moreover, depletion of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR2 renders cells hypersensitive to genotoxic agents, increases genomic instability and hampers homologous recombination by impairing DNA resection. Such a role of ADAR2 in DNA repair goes beyond the recoding of specific transcripts, but depends on ADAR2 editing DNA:RNA hybrids to ease their dissolution.\n\nOne sentence summaryDNA recombination requires RNA editing of DNA:RNA hybrids to ease their melting and facilitate DNA end resection",

While K(O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-la) can be introduced by the acetyltransferase p300, histone delactylase enzymes remain unknown.

We further confirmed the de-O_SCPLOWLC_SCPLOW-lactylase activity of HDACs 1 and 3 in cells.

    "abstract": "Enveloped viruses are enclosed by a lipid membrane inside of which are all of the components necessary for the virus life cycle; viral proteins, the viral genome and metabolites. Viral envelopes are lipid bilayers that adopt morphologies ranging from spheres to tubes. The envelope is derived from the host cell during viral replication. Thus, the composition of the bilayer depends on the complex constitution of lipids from the host-cells organelle(s) where assembly and/or budding of the viral particle occurs. Here, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of authentic, asymmetric HIV-1 liposomes are used to derive a unique level of resolution of its full-scale structure, mechanics and dynamics. Analysis of the structural properties reveal the distribution of thicknesses of the bilayers over the entire liposome as well as its global fluctuations. Moreover, full-scale mechanical analyses are employed to derive the global bending rigidity of HIV-1 liposomes. Finally, dynamical properties of the lipid molecules reveal important relationships between their 3D diffusion, the location of lipid-rafts and the asymmetrical composition of the envelope. Overall, our simulations reveal complex relationships between the rich lipid composition of the HIV-1 liposome and its structural, mechanical and dynamical properties with critical consequences to different stages of HIV-1s life cycle.",

Functional genetic screens performed in cells and organoids that acquired resistance to PARPi by loss of 53BP1 identified loss of LIG3 as an enhancer of PARPi toxicity in BRCA1-deficient cells. Enhancement of PARPi toxicity by LIG3 depletion is dependent on BRCA1 deficiency but independent of the loss of 53BP1 pathway.

Here, we report the genome-resolved metagenomic characterization of two newly identified marine species we tentatively named  Ca. Trichodesmium miru and  Ca. Trichodesmium nobis. Near-complete environmental genomes for those closely related candidate species revealed unexpected functional features including a lack of the entire nitrogen fixation gene apparatus and hydrogen recycling genes concomitant with the enrichment of nitrogen assimilation genes and apparent acquisition of the nirb gene from a non-cyanobacterial lineage. These comparative genomic insights were cross-validated by complementary metagenomic investigations. Our results contrast with the current paradigm that Trichodesmium species are necessarily capable of nitrogen fixation. The black queen hypothesis could explain gene loss linked to nitrogen fixation among Trichodesmium species, possibly triggered by gene acquisitions from the colony epibionts. Critically, the candidate species are not only widespread in the 3-2000 m planktonic size fraction of the surface of the oceans and seas, but might also substantially expand the ecological niche of Trichodesmium, stressing the need to disconnect taxonomic signal for this genus from a microbial communitys ability to fix nitrogen. Especially, differentiating diazotrophic from non-diazotrophic populations when counting Trichodesmium filaments and colonies might help refine our understanding of the marine nitrogen balance. While culture representatives are needed to move beyond metagenomic insights, we are reminded that established links between taxonomic lineages and functional traits might not always hold true.",

    "abstract": "DUX4 is a transcription factor and a master regulator of embryonic genome activation (EGA). During early embryogenesis, EGA is crucial for maternal to zygotic transition at the 8-cell stage in order to overcome silencing of genes and enable transcription from the zygotic genome. In adult somatic cells, DUX4 expression is largely silenced. Activation is likely pathogenic, and in adult muscle cells causes genetic disorder Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy (FSHD).\n\nWe identified activation of DUX4 expression upon lytic replication of the herpesviruses HSV-1, HCMV, EBV and KSHV, but not of adenoviruses, negative strand RNA viruses or positive strand RNA viruses. We demonstrate by RNA-Seq analysis that DUX4 expression upon herpesviral replication leads to the induction of hundreds of DUX4 target genes including germline-specific retroelements as well as several members of the TRIM, PRAMEF and ZSCAN protein families. Moreover, we show that DUX4 expression is a direct consequence of herpesviral infection. DUX4 can be stimulated by overexpression of HSV-1 immediate early proteins, indicating active induction of EGA genes by herpesviral infection. We further show that DUX4 expression is critical for driving HSV-1 gene expression.\n\nOur results show that viruses from alpha-, beta- and gamma-herpesvirus subfamilies induce DUX4 expression and downstream germline-specific genes and retroelements. We hypothesize that herpesviruses induce DUX4 expression in order to induce an early embryonic-like transcriptional program that prevents epigenetic silencing of the viral genome and facilitates herpesviral gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), eosinophil derived neurotoxin (EDN), and human pancreatic ribonuclease (HPR) are members of the RNase A superfamily having similar catalytic residues and diverse functions. Alarmins are the endogenous mediators of innate immunity which activate or alarm the adaptive immune system by activating antigen presenting cells (APCs). EDN acts as an alarmin molecule and plays an important role in innate as well as adaptive immunity. EDN displays chemotactic activity for dendritic cells (DCs) and activates them, has antiviral and antiparasitic activities, and is rapidly released from immune cells. HPR only displays chemotactic activity while no such activity has been reported for ECP. In this study we show that ECP displays the chemotactic activity comparable to that of HPR and EDN. ECP also interacts with TLR-2 to activate NF-{kappa}B/AP-1 expression like EDN. The RNase activity of ECP, EDN and HPR, and basicity of ECP were found to be crucial determinants for their chemotactic activity for APCs, however for the DC maturation activity, RNase activity was not found to be essential. Bovine RNase A did not show any chemotactic activity despite having a very high RNase activity indicating that other determinants in addition to the RNase activity are involved in the chemotactic activity of ECP, EDN and HPR. The current study establishes that ECP also can act like an alarmin.",

    "abstract": "Gonadal sexual fate in mammals is determined during embryonic development and must be actively maintained in adulthood. In the mouse ovary, oestrogen receptors and FOXL2 protect ovarian granulosa cells from transdifferentiation into Sertoli cells, their testicular counterpart. However, the mechanism underlying their protective effect is unknown. Here, we show that TRIM28 is required to prevent female-to-male sex reversal of the mouse ovary after birth. We found that upon loss of Trim28, ovarian granulosa cells transdifferentiate to Sertoli cells through an intermediate cell type, different from gonadal embryonic progenitors. TRIM28 is recruited on chromatin in the proximity of FOXL2 to maintain the ovarian pathway and to repress testicular-specific genes. The role of TRIM28 in ovarian maintenance depends on its E3-SUMO ligase activity that regulates the sex-specific SUMOylation profile of ovarian-specific genes. Our study identifies TRIM28 as a key factor in protecting the adult ovary from the testicular pathway.",

    "abstract": "The Hippo signaling pathway has been shown to be involved in the regulation of cellular identity, cell/tissue size maintenance and mechanotransduction. The Hippo pathway consists of a kinase cascade which determines the nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of YAP in the cell. YAP is the effector protein in the Hippo pathway which acts as a transcriptional cofactor for TEAD. Phosphorylation of YAP upon activation of the Hippo pathway prevents it from entering the nucleus and hence abrogates its function in transcription of target genes. In Cnidaria, the information on the regulatory roles of the Hippo pathway is virtually lacking. Here, we report for the first time the existence of a complete set of Hippo pathway core components in Hydra. By studying their phylogeny and domain organization, we report evolutionary conservation of the components of the Hippo pathway. Protein modelling suggested conservation of YAP-TEAD interaction in Hydra. We also characterized the expression pattern of the homologs of yap, hippo, mob and sav in Hydra using whole mount RNA in situ hybridization and report their possible role in stem cell maintenance. Immunofluorescence assay revealed that Hvul_YAP expressing cells occur in clusters in the body column and are excluded in the terminally differentiated regions. The YAP expressing cells are recruited early during head regeneration and budding implicating the Hippo pathway in early response to injury or establishment of oral fate. These cells exhibit a non-clustered existence at the site of regeneration and budding, indicating the involvement of a new population of YAP expressing cells during oral fate specification. Collectively, we posit that the Hippo pathway is an important signaling system in Hydra, its components are ubiquitously expressed in the Hydra body column, and may play crucial role in Hydra oral fate specification.",

Long-term, stable and sustainable reference materials (RMs) are a critical component of the QA/QC system, however, the limited selection of currently available matrix matched RMs reduce their applicability for widespread use. To produce a RM in any context, for any matrix that is robust to changes over the course of time we developed IBAT (Iterative Batch Averaging meThod). To illustrate this method, we generated 11 independently grown E. coli batches and made a RM over the course of 10 IBAT iterations. We measured the variance of these materials by NMR and showed that IBAT produces a stable and sustainable RM over time. This E. coli RM was then used as food source to produce a C. elegans RM for a metabolomics experiment. The metabolite extraction of this material alongside 41 independently grown individual C. elegans samples of the same genotype, allowed to estimate the proportion of sample variation in pre-analytical steps. From the NMR data, we found that 40% of the metabolite variance is due to the metabolite extraction process and analysis and 60% is due to sample-to-sample variance. The availability of RMs in untargeted metabolomics is one of the predominant needs of the metabolomics community that reach beyond quality control practices. IBAT addresses this need by facilitating the production of biologically relevant RMs and increasing their widespread use.",

    "abstract": "Long Intergenic Non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are the largest class of long non-coding RNAs in the eukaryotes, which originate from the intergenic regions of the genome. A ~4kb long lincRNA-p21 is derived from a transcription unit next to the p21/Cdkn1a gene locus. LincRNA-p21 plays key regulatory roles in p53 dependent transcriptional repression and translational repression through its physical association with proteins such as hnRNP-K and HuR.It is also involved in the aberrant gene expression in different cancers. However, detailed information on its structure, recognition, and trans-regulation by proteins is not well known. In this study, we have carried out a complete gene analysis and annotation of lincRNA-p21. This analysis showed that lincRNA-p21 is highly conserved in primates, and its conservation drops significantly in lower organisms. Furthermore, our analysis has revealed two structurally conserved domains in the 5 and 3 terminal regions of lincRNA-p21. Phylogenetic analysis has revealed discrete evolutionary dynamics in these conserved domains for orthologous sequences of lincRNA-p21, which have evolved slowly across primates compared to other mammals. Using Infernal based covariance analysis, we have computed the secondary structures of these domains. The secondary structures were further validated by energy minimization criteria for individual orthologous sequences as well as the full-length human lincRNA-p21. In summary, this analysis has led to the identification of sequence and structural motifs in the conserved fragments, indicating the functional importance for these regions.",

Physiological neuronal activity, including exposure of mice to learning behaviors, also cause the formation of DSBs, yet the distribution of these breaks and their relation to brain function remains unclear. Here, following contextual fear conditioning (CFC) in mice, we profiled the locations of DSBs genome-wide in the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus using {gamma}H2AX ChIP-Seq. Remarkably, we found that DSB formation is widespread in the brain compared to cultured primary neurons and they are predominately involved in synaptic processes. We observed increased DNA breaks at genes induced by CFC in neuronal and non-neuronal nuclei. Activity-regulated and proteostasis-related transcription factors appear to govern some of these gene expression changes across cell types. Finally, we find that glia but not neurons have a robust transcriptional response to glucocorticoids, and many of these genes are sites of DSBs. Our results indicate that learning behaviors cause widespread DSB formation in the brain that are associated with experience-driven transcriptional changes across both neuronal and glial cells.",

    "abstract": "The killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) complex on chromosome 19 encodes receptors that modulate the activity of natural killer cells, and variation in these genes has been linked to infectious and autoimmune disease, as well as having bearing on pregnancy and transplant outcomes. The medical relevance and high variability of KIR genes makes short-read sequencing an attractive technology for interrogating the region, providing a high-throughput, high-fidelity sequencing method that is cost-effective. However, because this gene complex is characterized by extensive nucleotide polymorphism, structural variation including gene fusions and deletions, and a high level of homology between genes, its interrogation at high resolution has been thwarted by bioinformatic challenges, with most studies limited to examining presence or absence of specific genes. Here, we present the PING (Pushing Immunogenetics to the Next Generation) pipeline, which incorporates empirical data, novel alignment strategies and a custom alignment processing workflow to enable high-throughput KIR sequence analysis from short-read data. PING provides KIR gene copy number classification functionality for all KIR genes through use of a comprehensive alignment reference. The gene copy number determined per individual enables an innovative genotype determination workflow using genotype-matched references. Together, these methods address the challenges imposed by the structural complexity and overall homology of the KIR complex. To determine copy number and genotype determination accuracy, we applied PING to European and African validation cohorts and a synthetic dataset. PING demonstrated exceptional copy number determination performance across all datasets and robust genotype determination performance. Finally, an investigation into discordant genotypes for the synthetic dataset provides insight into misaligned reads, advancing our understanding in interpretation of short-read sequencing data in complex genomic regions. PING promises to support a new era of studies of KIR polymorphism, delivering high-resolution KIR genotypes that are highly accurate, enabling high-quality, high-throughput KIR genotyping for disease and population studies.\n\nAuthor summaryKiller cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) serve a critical role in regulating natural killer cell function. They are encoded by highly polymorphic genes within a complex genomic region that has proven difficult to interrogate owing to structural variation and extensive sequence homology. While methods for sequencing KIR genes have matured, there is a lack of bioinformatic support to accurately interpret KIR short-read sequencing data. The extensive structural variation of KIR, both the small-scale nucleotide insertions and deletions and the large-scale gene duplications and deletions, coupled with the extensive sequence similarity among KIR genes presents considerable challenges to bioinformatic analyses. PING addressed these issues through a highly-dynamic alignment workflow, which constructs individualized references that reflect the determined copy number and genotype makeup of a sample. This alignment workflow is enabled by a custom alignment processing pipeline, which scaffolds reads aligned to all reference sequences from the same gene into an overall gene alignment, enabling processing of these alignments as if a single reference sequence was used regardless of the number of sequences or of any insertions or deletions present in the component sequences. Together, these methods provide a novel and robust workflow for the accurate interpretation of KIR short-read sequencing data.",

Contrasting descriptions of the initial events of these recruitment processes, whether settlement is induced by (1) natural multi-species biofilms, (2) biofilms composed of single bacterial species known to induce settlement, or (3) a bacterial extract stimulated the research described here. We found that settlement induced by natural biofilms or biofilms formed by the bacterium Pseudoalteromonas luteoviolacea is invariably initiated by attachment and secretion of an adherent and larva-enveloping primary tube, followed by loss of motile cilia and ciliated cells and morphogenesis. The bacterial extract containing complex tailocin arrays derived from an assemblage of phage genes incorporated into the bacterial genome appears to induce settlement events by destruction of larval cilia and ciliated cells, followed by attachment and primary-tube formation. Similar destruction occurred when precompetent larvae and larvae of a nudibranch gastropod were exposed to the extract, neither of which metamorphosed. We further argue that larvae that lose their cilia before attachment would be swept away from the sites that stimulated settlement by the turbulent flow characteristic of most marine habitats.",

    "abstract": "Prediction is one the last frontiers in ecology. Indeed, predicting fine scale species composition in natural systems is a complex challenge as multiple abiotic and biotic processes operate simultaneously to determine local species abundances. On the one hand, species intrinsic performance and their tolerance limits to different abiotic pressures modulate species abundances. On the other hand there is growing recognition that species interactions play an equally important role in limiting or promoting such abundances within ecological communities. Here, we present a joint effort between ecologists and data scientists to use data-driven models informed by ecological deterministic processes to predict species abundances using reasonably easy to obtain data. To overcome the classical procedure in ecology of parameterizing complex population models of multiple species interactions and poor predictive power, we followed instead a sequential data-driven modeling approach. We use this framework to predict species abundances over 5 years in a highly diverse annual plant community. Our models show a surprisingly high spatial predictive accuracy (RSE ~ 0.13) using only easy to measure variables in the field, yet such predictive power is lost when temporal dynamics are taken into account. This result suggest that predicting the temporal dimension of our system requires longer time series data. Such data would likely capture additional sources of variability that determine temporal patterns of species abundances. In addition, we show that these data-driven models can also inform back mechanistic models of important missing variables that affect species performance such as particular soil conditions (e.g. carbonate availability in our case). Being able to gain predictive power at fine-scale species composition while maintaining a mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes can be a pivotal tool for conservation, specially given the human induced rapid environmental changes we are experiencing. Here, we document how this objective can be achieved by promoting the interplay between classic modelling approaches in ecology and recently developed data-driven models.\n\nAuthor summaryPrediction is challenging but recently developed machine learning techniques allow to dramatically improve prediction accuracy in several domains. However, these tools are often of little application in ecology due to the complexity of gathering information on the needed explanatory variables, which often comprise not only physical variables such as temperature or soil nutrients, but also information about the complex network of species interactions regulating species abundances. Here we present a two-step sequential modelling framework that overcomes these constraints. We first infer potential species abundances training models just with easily obtained abiotic variables, and then use this outcome to fine-tune the prediction of the realized species abundances when taking into account the rest of the predicted species in the community. Overall, our results show a promising way forward for fine scale prediction in ecology.",

    "abstract": "DNA de novo assembly can be used to reconstruct longer stretches of DNA (contigs), including genes and even genomes, from short DNA sequencing reads. Applying this technique to metagenomic data derived from archaeological remains, such as paleofeces and dental calculus, we can investigate past microbiome functional diversity that may be absent or underrepresented in the modern microbiome gene catalogue. However, compared to modern samples, ancient samples are often burdened with environmental contamination, resulting in metagenomic datasets that represent mixtures of ancient and modern DNA. The ability to rapidly and reliably establish the authenticity and integrity of ancient samples is essential for ancient DNA studies, and the ability to distinguish between ancient and modern sequences is particularly important for ancient microbiome studies. Characteristic patterns of ancient DNA damage, namely DNA fragmentation and cytosine deamination (observed as C-to-T transitions) are typically used to authenticate ancient samples and sequences. However, existing tools for inspecting and filtering aDNA damage either compute it at the read level, which leads to high data loss and lower quality when used in combination with de novo assembly, or require manual inspection, which is impractical for ancient assemblies that typically contain tens to hundreds of thousands of contigs. To address these challenges, we designed PyDamage, a robust, automated approach for aDNA damage estimation and authentication of de novo assembled aDNA. PyDamage uses a likelihood ratio based approach to discriminate between truly ancient contigs and contigs originating from modern contamination. We test PyDamage on both simulated, and empirical aDNA data from archaeological paleofeces, and we demonstrate its ability to reliably and automatically identify contigs bearing DNA damage characteristic of aDNA. Coupled with aDNA de novo assembly, PyDamage opens up new doors to explore functional diversity in ancient metagenomic datasets.",

We identified a set of symmetric, hierarchical, and replicable networks: sensorimotor, visual, default mode, ventral attention, and high-level vision. We quantified individual variability across neonates, and found the most individual variability in the ventral attention networks. Crucially, the variability of these networks were not driven by SNR differences or differences from adult networks (Yeo et al., 2011). Finally, differential gene expression provided a potential explanation for the emergence of these distinct networks and identified potential genes of interest for future developmental and individual variability research. Overall, we found neonatal connectomes (even at the voxel-level) can reveal broad individual- specific information processing units. The presence of individual differences in neonates and the framework for personalized parcellations demonstrated here has the potential to improve prediction of behavior and future outcomes from neonatal and infant brain data.",

Several studies have now demonstrated that increased neurogenesis can induce forgetting of memories acquired prior to the manipulation of neurogenesis and, as a result of this forgetting can also facilitate new learning. However, the mechanisms mediating neurogenesis-induced forgetting are not well understood. Here, we used a subregion-based analysis of the immediate early gene c-Fos as well as in vivo fiber photometry to determine changes in activity corresponding with neurogenesis induced forgetting. We found that increasing neurogenesis led to reduced CA1 activity during context memory retrieval. We also demonstrate here that perineuronal net expression in areas CA1 is bidirectionally altered by the levels or activity of adult generated neurons in the dentate gyrus. These results suggest that neurogenesis may induce forgetting by disrupting perineuronal nets in CA1 which may otherwise protect memories from degradation.",

    "abstract": "Toxoplasma gondii ERK7 is known to contribute to the integrity of the apical complex and to be involved only in the final step of the conoid biogenesis. In the absence of ERK7, mature parasites lose their conoid complex and are unable to glide, invade or egress from host cells. In contrast to a previous report, we show here that depletion of ERK7 phenocopies the depletion of the apical cap proteins AC9 or AC10. The absence of ERK7 leads to the loss of the apical polar ring, the disorganization of the basket of subpellicular microtubules and an impairment in micronemes secretion. Ultra-expansion microscopy (U-ExM) coupled to NHS-Ester staining on intracellular parasites offers an unprecedented level of resolution and highlights the disorganization of the rhoptries as well as the dilated plasma membrane at the apical pole in the absence of ERK7. Comparative proteomics analysis of wild-type and ERK7 or AC9 depleted parasites led to the disappearance of known, predicted, as well as putative novel components of the apical complex. In contrast, the absence of ERK7 led to an accumulation of microneme proteins, resulting from the defect in exocytosis of the organelles.\n\nImportanceThe conoid is an enigmatic, dynamic organelle positioned at the apical tip of the coccidian subgroup of the Apicomplexa, close to the apical polar ring (APR) from which the subpellicular microtubules (SPTMs) emerge and at the site of microneme and rhoptry secretory organelles exocytosis. In Toxoplasma gondii, the conoid protrudes concomitantly to microneme secretion, during egress, motility and invasion. The conditional depletion of the apical cap structural protein AC9 or AC10 leads to a disorganization of SPTMs as well as the loss of APR and conoid that result in microneme secretion defect and block in motility, invasion and egress. We show here that depletion of the kinase ERK7 phenocopies completely AC9 and AC10 mutants. Moreover, the combination of ultrastructure expansion microscopy with an NHS ester staining revealed that ERK7 depleted parasites exhibit a dilated apical plasma membrane and a mis-positioning of the rhoptry organelles.",
