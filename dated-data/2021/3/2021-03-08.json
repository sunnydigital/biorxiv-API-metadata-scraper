    "abstract": "Short duration overnight cattle kraaling in natural rangelands creates nutrients hotspots attractive to a diverse suite of large mammalian herbivores. However, few studies have determined the use of these sites by large mammalian herbivores. We determined the number of animal sightings per day from camera traps and used them as proxies for use of these newly created nutrient hotspots of varying ages (1, 2, 3 and 4 years) and surrounding vegetation. Six mammalian herbivores of different sizes belonging to three feeding guilds viz. grazers (Burchells zebra Equus quagga burchelli and warthog Phacochoerus africanus), mixed feeders (impala Aepyceros melampus and African savanna elephant Loxodonta africana africana) and browsers (northern giraffe Giraffa camelopardalis giraffa and greater kudu Tragelaphus strepsiceros) frequently used these nutrient hotspots. The number of sightings per day of mammalian herbivores was determined during three periods of the year (January - wet season; June - early dry season; October - late dry season) to ascertain their use of these nutrient hotspots. In addition, above ground grass biomass and height was measured and related to grazer sightings. Furthermore, we tested if repeated grazing in the newly created nutrient hotspots stimulated grass compensatory growth. All the mammalian herbivores used the newly created nutrient hotspots similarly throughout the year, with impala the most active users. Grazer and browser use of nutrient hotspots was not influenced by their age, while mixed feeders mostly used the one year old sites. Grazer use of nutrient hotspots was not influenced by aboveground grass biomass and height. Repeated clipping (proxy for grazing) resulted in compensatory aboveground grass biomass growth in nutrient hotspots. Impala benefited the most and zebra the least from the creation of nutrient hotspots in natural rangelands. We conclude that creation of nutrients hotspots through short duration overnight kraaling results in rangeland heterogeneity that improves availability of herbivore foraging sites.",

    "abstract": "Ammonium toxicity in plants is considered a global phenomenon, but the primary mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Here, we showed that although the addition of potassium (K+) or nitrate (NO3-) partially alleviated the inhibition of rice root growth caused by ammonium toxicity, the coexistence of K+ and NO3- clearly improved the alleviation via a synergistic mechanism. The synergism led to significantly improved alleviation effects on root biomass, length, surface area, number and meristem cell number. The aberrant auxin distribution in root tips, rhizosphere acidification level and abnormal cell morphology in the root cap and elongation zone caused by ammonium toxicity could be recovered by this synergism. RNA sequencing and the weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) revealed that the mechanism of this synergism involves cellulose synthesis, auxin and gibberellin metabolism regulation at the transcription level.",

    "abstract": "Nonstructural protein 1 (nsp1) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a 180-residue protein that blocks translation of host mRNAs in SARS-CoV-2-infected cells. Although it is known that SARS-CoV-2s own RNA evades nsp1s host translation shutoff, the molecular mechanism underlying the evasion was poorly understood. We performed an extended ensemble molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the mechanism of the viral RNA evasion. Simulation results showed that the stem loop structure of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA 5-untranslated region (SL1) is recognized by both nsp1s globular region and intrinsically disordered region. The recognition presumably enables selective translation of viral RNAs. Cluster analysis of the binding mode and detailed analysis of the binding poses revealed several residues involved in the SL1 recognition mechanism. The simulation results imply that the nsp1 C-terminal helices are lifted from the 40S ribosome upon the binding of SL1 to nsp1, unblocking translation of the viral RNA.",

    "abstract": "Structural variants (SVs) are an important source of human genome diversity but their functional effects are not well understood. We mapped 61,668 SVs in 613 individuals with deep genome sequencing data from the GTEx project and measured their effects on gene expression. We estimate that common SVs are causal at 2.66% of eQTLs, which is a 10.5-fold enrichment relative to their abundance in the genome and consistent with prior work using smaller sample sizes. Duplications and deletions were the most impactful variant types, whereas the contribution of mobile element insertions was surprisingly small (0.12% of eQTLs, 1.9-fold enriched). Multi-tissue analysis of expression effects revealed that gene-altering SVs show significantly more constitutive effects than other variant types, with 62.09% of coding SV-eQTLs active in all tissues with known eQTL activity compared to 23.08% of coding SNV- and indel-eQTLs, whereas noncoding SVs, SNVs and indels show broadly similar patterns. We also identified 539 rare SVs associated with nearby gene expression outliers. Of these, 62.34% are noncoding SVs that show strong effects on gene expression yet modest enrichment at known regulatory elements, demonstrating that rare noncoding SVs are a major source of gene expression differences but remain difficult to predict from current annotations. Remarkably, both common and rare noncoding SVs often show strong regional effects on the expression of multiple genes: SV-eQTLs affect an average of 1.82 nearby genes compared to 1.09 genes affected by SNV- and indel-eQTLs, and 21.34% of rare expression-altering SVs show strong effects on 2-9 different genes. We also observe significant effects on gene expression extending 1 Mb from the SV. This provides a mechanism by which individual noncoding SVs may have strong and/or pleiotropic effects on phenotypic variation and disease.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundUnderstanding how study design and monitoring strategies shape inference within, and synthesis across, studies is critical across biological disciplines. Many biological and field studies are short term and limited in scope. Monitoring studies are critical for informing public health about potential vectors of concern, such as Ixodes scapularis (black-legged ticks). Black-legged ticks are a taxon of ecological and human health concern due to their status as primary vectors of Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme disease. However, variation in black-legged tick monitoring, and gaps in data, are currently considered major barriers to understanding population trends and in turn, predicting Lyme disease risk. To understand how variable methodology in black-legged tick studies may influence which population patterns researchers find, we conducted a data synthesis experiment.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe searched for publicly available black-legged tick abundance datasets that had at least 9 years of data, using keywords about ticks in internet search engines, literature databases, data repositories and public health websites. Our analysis included 289 datasets from 7 surveys from locations throughout the US, ranging in length from 9 to 24 years. We used a moving window analysis, which is a kind of non-random resampling approach, to investigate the temporal stability of black-legged tick population trajectories across the US. We then used t-tests to assess differences in stability time across different study parameters.\n\nResultsAll of our sampled datasets required 4 or more years to reach stability. We also found that several study factors can have an impact on the likelihood of a study reaching stability and of data resulting in misleading results if the study does not reach stability. Specifically, datasets collected via dragging reached stability significantly faster than data collected via opportunistic sampling. Datasets that sampled larva reached stability significantly later than those that sampled adults or nymphs. Additionally, datasets collected at the broadest spatial scale (county) reached stability fastest.\n\nConclusionWe used 289 datasets from 7 long term black-legged tick studies to conduct a non-random data resampling experiment, revealing that sampling design does shape inferences in black-legged tick population trajectories and how many years it takes to find stable patterns. Specifically, our results show the importance of study length, sampling technique, life stage, and geographic scope in understanding black-legged tick populations, in the absence of standardized surveillance methods. Current public health efforts based on existing black-legged tick datasets must take monitoring study parameters into account, to better understand if and how to use monitoring data to inform decision making. We also recommend that potential forecasting initiatives consider these parameters when projecting black-legged tick population trends.",

    "abstract": "Accurate variant effect prediction has broad impacts on protein engineering. Recent machine learning approaches toward this end are based on representation learning, by which feature vectors are learned and generated from unlabeled sequences. However, it is unclear how to effectively learn evolutionary properties of an engineering target protein from homologous sequences, taking into account the proteins sequence-level structure called domain architecture (DA). Additionally, no optimal protocols are established for incorporating such properties into Transformer, the neural network well-known to perform the best in natural language processing research. This article proposes DA-aware evolutionary fine-tuning, or \"evotuning\", protocols for Transformer-based variant effect prediction, considering various combinations of homology search, fine-tuning, and sequence vectorization strategies. We exhaustively evaluated our protocols on diverse proteins with different functions and DAs. The results indicated that our protocols achieved significantly better performances than previous DA-unaware ones. The visualizations of attention maps suggested that the structural information was incorporated by evotuning without direct supervision, possibly leading to better prediction accuracy.\n\nAvailabilityhttps://github.com/dlnp2/evotuning_protocols_for_transformers\n\nSupplementary informationSupplementary data are available at Briefings in Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Alterations in metabolism, sleep patterns, body composition, and hormone status are all key features of aging. The hypothalamus is a well-conserved brain region that controls these homeostatic and survival-related behaviors. Despite the importance of this brain region in healthy aging, little is known about the intrinsic features of hypothalamic aging. Here, we utilize single nuclei RNA-sequencing to assess the transcriptomes of 40,064 hypothalamic nuclei from young and aged female mice. We identify cell type-specific signatures of aging in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, as well as among the diverse collection of neuronal subtypes in this region. We uncover key changes in cell types critical for metabolic regulation and body composition, as well as in an area of the hypothalamus linked to cognition. In addition, our analysis reveals an unexpected female-specific feature of hypothalamic aging. Specifically, we discover that the master regulator of X-inactivation, Xist, is elevated with age, particularly in hypothalamic neurons. Moreover, using machine learning, we show that levels of X-chromosome genes, and Xist itself, are the best predictors of cellular age. Together, this study identifies critical cell-specific changes of the aging hypothalamus in mammals, and uncovers a novel marker of neuronal aging in females.",

However, whether the characteristics that make a brain distinguishable from others already exist at birth remains unknown. Here, we used neuroimaging data of preterm born neonates who were scanned twice during the perinatal period to assess the developing brain fingerprint. We found that 62% of the participants could be identified based on the congruence of the later structural connectome to the initial connectivity matrix derived from the earlier timepoint. In contrast, similarity between functional connectomes only allowed to identify 12% of the participants. These suggests that structural connectivity is more stable in early life and can represent a potential connectome fingerprint. Thus, a relatively stable structural connectome appears to support a changing functional connectome at a time when neonates must rapidly acquire new skills to adapt to their new environment.",

We showed that lipid removal by {beta}-cyclodextrin can mimic membrane tension. Here, we show that all cyclodextrins (CDs) can activate reconstituted E. coli MscS, that MscS activation by CDs depends on CD-mediated lipid removal, and that the CD amount required to gate MscS scales with the channels sensitivity to membrane tension. CD-mediated lipid removal ultimately causes MscS desensitization, which we show is affected by the lipid environment. CDs can also activate the structurally unrelated MscL. While many MS channels respond to membrane forces, generalized by the  force-from-lipids principle, their different molecular architectures suggest that they use unique ways to convert mechanical forces into conformational changes. CDs emerge as a universal tool for the structural and functional characterization of unrelated MS channels.",

    "abstract": "The acrosome reaction (AR) is an exocytotic process essential for mammalian fertilization. It involves diverse biochemical and physiological changes that culminate in the release of the acrosomal content to the extracellular medium as well as a reorganization of the plasma membrane (PM) that allows sperm to interact and fuse with the egg. In spite of many efforts, there are still important pending questions regarding the molecular mechanism regulating the AR. Particularly, the contribution of acrosomal alkalinization to AR triggering in physiological conditions is not well understood. Also, the dependence of the proportion of sperm capable of undergoing AR on the biochemical heterogeneity within a sperm population has not been studied. Here we present a discrete mathematical model for the human sperm AR, based on the biophysical and biochemical interactions among some of the main components of this complex exocytotic process. We show that this model can qualitatively reproduce diverse experimental results, and that it can be used to analyze how acrosomal pH (pHa) and cell heterogeneity regulate AR. Our results confirm that pHa increase can on its own trigger AR in a subpopulation of sperm, and furthermore, it indicates that this is a necessary step to trigger acrosomal exocytosis through progesterone, a known physiological inducer of AR. Most importantly, we show that the proportion of sperm undergoing AR is directly related to the detailed structure of the population biochemical heterogeneity.",

Methylases are site-specific and target sequences vary across organisms. High-throughput methods, such as bisulfite-sequencing can identify m5C at base resolution but require specialized library preparations and Single Molecule, Real-Time (SMRT) Sequencing usually misses m5C. Here, we present a new method called RIMS-seq (Rapid Identification of Methylase Specificity) to simultaneously sequence bacterial genomes and determine m5C methylase specificities using a simple experimental protocol that closely resembles the DNA-seq protocol for Illumina. Importantly, the resulting sequencing quality is identical to DNA-seq, enabling RIMS-seq to substitute standard sequencing of bacterial genomes. Applied to bacteria and synthetic mixed communities, RIMS-seq reveals new methylase specificities, supporting routine study of m5C methylation while sequencing new genomes.",

However, the mechanisms used to ensure such order remain poorly understood, particularly in bacteria. Here, we show that the activation of the essential CtrA signaling pathway that triggers cell division in Caulobacter crescentus is intrinsically coupled to the successful initiation of DNA replication via the physical translocation of a newly-replicated chromosome, powered by the ParABS system. We demonstrate that ParA accumulation at the new cell pole during chromosome segregation recruits ChpT, an intermediate component of the CtrA signaling pathway. ChpT is normally restricted from accessing the selective PopZ polar microdomain until the new chromosome and ParA arrive. Consequently, any disruption to DNA replication initiation prevents the recruitment of ChpT and, in turn, cell division. Collectively, our findings reveal how major cell-cycle events are coordinated in Caulobacter and, importantly, how the physical translocation of a chromosome triggers an essential signaling pathway.",
