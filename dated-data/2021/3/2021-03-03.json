    "abstract": "Clostridioides difficile is a leading cause of healthcare-associated infections worldwide. C. difficile infections are transmitted by its metabolically dormant, aerotolerant spore form. Functional spore formation depends on the assembly of two protective layers: a thick layer of modified peptidoglycan known as the cortex layer and a multilayered proteinaceous meshwork known as the coat. We previously identified two spore morphogenetic proteins, SpoIVA and SipL, that are essential for recruiting coat proteins to the developing forespore and making functional spores. While SpoIVA and SipL directly interact, the identities of the proteins they recruit to the forespore remained unknown. We used mass spectrometry-based affinity proteomics to identify proteins that interact with the SpoIVA-SipL complex. These analyses identified the Peptostreptococcaceae family-specific, sporulation-induced bitopic membrane protein CD3457 (renamed SpoVQ) as a protein that interacts with SipL and SpoIVA. Loss of SpoVQ decreased heat-resistant spore formation by [~]5-fold and reduced cortex thickness[~]2-fold; the thinner cortex layer of {Delta}spoVQ spores correlated with higher levels of spontaneous germination (i.e., in the absence of germinant). Notably, loss of SpoVQ in either spoIVA or sipL mutants prevented cortex synthesis altogether and greatly impaired the localization of a SipL-mCherry fusion protein around the forespore. Thus, SpoVQ is a novel regulator of C. difficile cortex synthesis that appears to link cortex and coat formation. The identification of SpoVQ as a spore morphogenetic protein further highlights how Peptostreptococcaceae family-specific mechanisms control spore formation in C. difficile.\n\nImportanceThe Centers for Disease Control has designated Clostridioides difficile as an urgent threat because of its intrinsic antibiotic resistance. C. difficile persists in the presence of antibiotics in part because it makes metabolically dormant spores. While recent work has shown that preventing the formation of infectious spores can reduce C. difficile disease recurrence, more selective anti-sporulation therapies are needed. The identification of spore morphogenetic factors specific to C. difficile would facilitate the development of such therapies. In this study, we identified SpoVQ (CD3457) as a spore morphogenetic protein specific to the Peptostreptococcaceae family that regulates the formation of C. difficiles protective spore cortex layer. SpoVQ acts in concert with the known spore coat morphogenetic factors, SpoIVA and SipL, to link formation of the protective coat and cortex layers. These data reveal a novel pathway that could be targeted to prevent the formation of infectious C. difficile spores.",

    "abstract": "The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) primarily reduces disease burden in adults through a reduction in carriage prevalence of invasive serotypes in children. Current vaccine formulations are the same for both adults and children, but tailoring these formulations to age category could optimize vaccine efficacy. Identification of specific pneumococcal genetic factors associated with carriage in younger or older age groups may suggest alternative formulations and contribute to a better mechanistic understanding of immunity. Here, we used whole genome sequencing to dissect pneumococcal variation associated with age. We performed genome sequencing in a large carriage cohort, and conducted a meta-analysis with an existing carriage study. We compiled a dictionary of pathogen genetic variation including serotype, sequence cluster, sequence elements, SNPs, burden combined rare variants, and clusters of orthologous genes (COGs) for each cohort - all of which used in a genome-wide association with host age. Age-dependent colonization had some heritability, though this varied between cohorts (h2 = 0.10, 0.00 - 0.69 95% CI in the first; h2 = 0.46, 0.33 - 0.60 95% CI in the second cohort). We found that serotypes and genetic background (strain) explained most of the heritability in each cohort (h2serotype = 0.06 and h2GPSC = 0.04 in the first; h2 serotype = 0.20 and h2 GPSC = 0.23 in the second cohort). We found one candidate association (p = 1.2x10-9) upstream of an accessory Sec-dependent serine-rich glycoprotein adhesin. Overall, association with age was highly cohort and strain dependent, supporting proposals for a future vaccination strategy which is primarily targeted using serotypes rather than proteins, and is tailored towards specific pathogen populations.",

    "abstract": "By offering extremely long contiguous characterization of individual DNA molecules, rapidly emerging long-read sequencing strategies offer comprehensive insights into the organization of genetic information in genomes and metagenomes. However, successful long-read sequencing experiments demand high concentrations of highly purified DNA of high molecular weight (HMW), which limits the utility of established DNA extraction kits designed for short-read sequencing. Challenges associated with input DNA quality intensify further when working with complex environmental samples of low microbial biomass, which requires new protocols that are tailored to study metagenomes with long-read sequencing. Here, we use human tongue scrapings to benchmark six HMW DNA extraction strategies that are based on commercially available kits, phenol-chloroform (PC) extraction, and agarose encasement followed by agarase digestion. A typical end goal of HMW DNA extractions is to obtain the longest possible reads during sequencing, which is often achieved by PC extractions as demonstrated in sequencing of cultured cells. Yet our analyses that consider overall read-size distribution, assembly performance, and the number of circularized elements found in sequencing results suggest that non-PC methods may be more appropriate for long-read sequencing of metagenomes.",

    "abstract": "The endolysosomal system not only is an integral part of the cellular catabolic machinery that processes and recycles nutrients for synthesis of biomaterials, but also acts as signaling hub to sense and coordinate the energy state of cells with growth and differentiation. Lysosomal dysfunction adversely influences vesicular transport-dependent macromolecular degradation and thus causes serious problems for human health. In mammalian cells, loss of the lysosome associated membrane proteins LAMP1/2 strongly impacts autophagy and cholesterol trafficking. Here we show that the previously uncharacterized Drosophila Lamp1 is a bona fide homolog of vertebrate LAMP1/2. Surprisingly and in contrast to Lamp1/2 double mutant mice, Drosophila Lamp1 is not required for viability or autophagy, suggesting that autophagy defects in Lamp1/2 mutants may have indirect causes. However, Lamp1 deficiency results in an expansion of the acidic compartment in flies. Furthermore, we find that Lamp1 mutant larvae have defects in lipid metabolism as they show elevated levels of sterols and diacylglycerols (DAGs). Since DAGs are the main lipid species used for transport though the hemolymph (blood) in insects, our results indicate broader functions of Lamp1 in lipid transport. Our findings make Drosophila an ideal model to study the role of LAMP proteins in lipid assimilation without the confounding effects of their storage and without interfering with autophagic processes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundX-chromosome inactivation (XCI) is the epigenetic inactivation of one of two X chromosomes in XX eutherian mammals. The facultatively heterochromatic inactive X chromosome acquires many chromatin changes including DNA methylation and histone modifications. Despite these changes, some genes escape or variably escape from inactivation, and to the extent that they have been studied, epigenetic marks correlate with expression.\n\nResultsWe downloaded data from the International Human Epigenome Consortium and compared previous XCI status calls to DNA methylation, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3. At genes subject to XCI we found heterochromatic marks enriched, and euchromatic marks depleted on the inactive X when compared to the active X. Similar results were seen for genes escaping XCI although with diminished effect with H3K27me3 being most enriched. Using sample-specific XCI status calls made using allelic expression or DNA methylation we also compared differences between samples with opposite XCI statuses at variably escaping genes. We found some marks significantly differed with XCI status, but which marks were significant was not consistent between genes. We trained a model to predict XCI status from these epigenetic marks and obtained over 75% accuracy for genes escaping and over 90% for genes subject to XCI. This model allowed us to make novel XCI status calls for genes without allelic differences or CpG islands required for other XCI status calling methods. Using these calls to examine a domain of variably escaping genes, we saw XCI status vary at the level of individual genes and not at the domain level.\n\nConclusionHere we show that epigenetic marks differ between genes that are escaping and those subject to XCI, and that genes escaping XCI still differ between the active and inactive Xs. We show epigenetic differences at variably escaping genes, between samples escaping and those subject to XCI. Lastly we show gene-level regulation of variably escaping genes within a domain.",

    "abstract": "MotivationSingle-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has made it possible to profile gene expression in tissues at high resolution. An important preprocessing step prior to performing downstream analyses is to identify and remove cells with poor or degraded sample quality using quality control (QC) metrics. Two widely used QC metrics to identify a  low-quality cell are (i) if the cell includes a high proportion of reads that map to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded genes and (ii) if a small number of genes are detected. Current best practices use these QC metrics independently with either arbitrary, uniform thresholds (e.g. 5%) or biological context-dependent (e.g. species) thresholds, and fail to jointly model these metrics in a data-driven manner. Current practices are often overly stringent and especially untenable on lower-quality tissues, such as archived tumor tissues.\n\nResultsWe propose a data-driven QC metric (miQC) that jointly models both the proportion of reads mapping to mtDNA genes and the number of detected genes with mixture models in a probabilistic framework to predict the low-quality cells in a given dataset. We demonstrate how our QC metric easily adapts to different types of single-cell datasets to remove low-quality cells while preserving high-quality cells that can be used for downstream analyses.\n\nAvailabilitySoftware available at https://github.com/greenelab/miQC.

    "abstract": "Expansion microscopy is an emerging approach for morphological examination of biological specimens at nanoscale resolution using conventional optical microscopy. To achieve physical separation of cell structures, tissues are embedded in a swellable polymer and expanded several folds in an isotropic manner. This work shows the development and optimization of physical tissue expansion as a new method for spatially resolved large scale proteomics. Herein, we established a novel method to enlarge the tissue section to be compatible with manual microdissection on regions of interest and to carry out MS-based proteomic analysis. A major issue in the Expansion microscopy is the loss of proteins information during the mechanical homogenization phase due to the use of Proteinase K. For isotropic expansion, different homogenization agents are investigated, both to maximize protein identification and to minimize protein diffusion. Better results are obtained with SDS. From a tissue section enlarge more than 3-fold, we have been able to manually cut out regions of 1mm in size, equivalent to 300{micro}m in their real size. We identified up to 655 proteins from a region corresponding to an average of 940 cells. This approach can be performed easily without any expensive sampling instrument. We demonstrated the compatibility of sample preparation for expansion microscopy and proteomic study in a spatial context.\n\nAbstract graphic\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=115 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/433765v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14cc519org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1201e36org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@19fa853org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e4112a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

PSD-95 is regulated by phosphorylation, but technical challenges have limited studies of the molecular details. Here, we genetically introduced site-specific phosphorylations in single, tandem and full-length PSD-95 and generated a total of 11 phosphorylated protein variants. We examined how these phosphorylations affected binding to known interaction partners and the impact on phase separation of PSD-95 complexes, and identified two new phosphorylation sites with opposing effects. Phosphorylation of Ser78 inhibited phase separation with the glutamate receptor subunit GluN2B and the auxiliary protein stargazin, whereas phosphorylation of Ser116 induced phase separation with stargazin only. Thus, by genetically introducing phosphoserine site-specifically and exploring the impact on phase separation, we have provided new insights into the regulation of PSD-95 by phosphorylation and the dynamics of the PSD.\n\nGraphical Abstract: Phosphorylation of PSD-95.\n\nO_LIIllustration of the interaction between the PDZ domains of PSD-95 and the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) (PDB: 4PE5) at the plasma membrane.

We found that in some cases LLPS formation is dependent on multivalent interactions while in other cases short peptides carrying a high charge are sufficient to promote LLPS in complex systems. This study offers a new perspective on PSD-95 interactions and their role in LLPS formation, while also considering the role of affinity over multivalency in LLPS systems.",

    "abstract": "Multiple pathways mediate the repair of DNA double-strand break (DSB), with numerous mechanisms responsible for driving choice between the pathways. Previously, we reported that phosphorylation of the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) factor, Ku70, is required for the dissociation of the Ku heterodimer from DNA ends to allow DSB repair via homologous recombination (HR). A knock-in mouse, in which phosphorylation is ablated in the three conserved sites of Ku70 (Ku703A/3A), was generated in order to test the hypothesis that Ku70 phosphorylation is required for initiation of HR and that blocking this process results in enhanced genomic instability and tumorigenesis. Here, we show that Ku703A/3A mice develop spontaneous and have accelerated chemical-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) compared to wild-type (Ku70+/+) littermates. The HCC tumors from the Ku703A/3A mice have increased {gamma}H2AX and 8-oxo-G staining, suggesting DNA repair is decreased in these mice. Spontaneous transformed cell lines from Ku703A/3A mice are more radiosensitive, have a significant decrease in DNA end resection, and are more sensitive to the DNA cross-linking agent mitomycin C compared to cells from Ku70+/+ littermates. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that phosphorylation-mediated dissociation of Ku heterodimer from DNA ends is required for efficient DNA damage repair and disruption of this process results in genomic instability and accelerated development of HCC.",

    "abstract": "Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR) bacteria are small, likely episymbiotic organisms found across Earths ecosystems. Despite their prevalence, the distribution of CPR lineages across habitats and the genomic signatures of transitions amongst these habitats remain unclear. Here, we expand the genome inventory for Absconditabacteria (SR1), Gracilibacteria, and Saccharibacteria (TM7), CPR bacteria known to occur in both animal-associated and environmental microbiomes, and investigate variation in gene content with habitat of origin. By overlaying phylogeny with habitat information, we show that bacteria from these three lineages have undergone multiple transitions from environmental habitats into animal microbiomes. Based on co-occurrence analyses of hundreds of metagenomes, we extend the prior suggestion that certain Saccharibacteria have broad bacterial host ranges and constrain possible host relationships for Absconditabacteria and Gracilibacteria. Full-proteome analyses show that animal-associated Saccharibacteria have smaller gene repertoires than their environmental counterparts and are enriched in numerous protein families, including those likely functioning in amino acid metabolism, phage defense, and detoxification of peroxide. In contrast, some freshwater Saccharibacteria encode a putative rhodopsin. For protein families exhibiting the clearest patterns of differential habitat distribution, we compared protein and species phylogenies to estimate the incidence of lateral gene transfer and genomic loss occurring over the species tree. These analyses suggest that habitat transitions were likely not accompanied by large transfer or loss events, but rather were associated with continuous proteome remodeling. Thus, we speculate that CPR habitat transitions were driven largely by availability of suitable host taxa, and were reinforced by acquisition and loss of some capacities.\n\nIMPORTANCEStudying the genetic differences between related microorganisms from different environment types can indicate factors associated with their movement among habitats. This is particularly interesting for bacteria from the Candidate Phyla Radiation because their minimal metabolic capabilities require symbiotic associations with microbial hosts. We found that shifts of Absconditabacteria, Gracilibacteria, and Saccharibacteria between environmental ecosystems and mammalian mouths/guts probably did not involve major episodes of gene gain and loss; rather, gradual genomic change likely followed habitat migration. The results inform our understanding of how little-known microorganisms establish in the human microbiota where they may ultimately impact health.",

    "abstract": "The rapid emergence of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria (CPGNB) is a global threat due to the high mortality of infection and limited treatment options. Although there have been many reports of CPGNB isolated from Southeast Asian countries, to date there has been no genetic analysis of CPGNB isolated from Cambodia. Sequence-based molecular epidemiological analysis enables a better understanding of the genotypic characteristics and epidemiological significance of antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) bacteria in each country, and allows countries to enact measures related to AMR issues. In this study, we performed on-site genomic epidemiological analysis of CPGNB isolated in Cambodia using a portable laboratory equipment called Bento Lab, which combines a PCR thermal cycler, microcentrifuge, gel electrophoresis apparatus, and LED transilluminator, along with the MinION nanopore sequencer. PCR targeting of major carbapenemase genes using Bento Lab revealed that two Escherichia coli isolates and one Acinetobacter baumannii isolate harbored carbapenemase genes: blaNDM, blaOXA-48, and blaOXA-23, respectively. The results of phenotypic diagnostic tests for CPGNB, such as the carbapenem inactivation method and double-disk diffusion test using a specific inhibitor of metallo-{beta}-lactamases, were consistent with their AMR genotypes. Whole-genome sequencing analysis using MinION suggested that blaNDM-5 and blaOXA-181 genes were carried on plasmids (93.9-kb plasmid with IncFIA, IncFIB, IncFII, and IncQ1 replicons, and 51.5-kb plasmid with the IncX3 replicon, respectively) in E. coli, and that blaOXA-23 was encoded in two locations on the chromosome of A. baumannii. Plasmids carrying blaNDM-5 or blaOXA-181 in E. coli were highly structurally identical to plasmids prevalent in Enterobacterales in China and other countries, suggesting that they disseminated from a common evolutionary origin. Our findings demonstrate the potential impact of portable laboratory equipment on AMR bacteria research in hospitals and research centers with limited research facilities, and provide the first glimpse into the genomic epidemiology of CPGNB in Cambodia.",

    "abstract": "It is increasingly appreciated that intracellular pH changes are important biological signals. This motivates the elucidation of molecular mechanisms of pH-sensing. We determined that a nucleocytoplasmic pH oscillation was required for the transcriptional response to carbon starvation in S. cerevisiae. The SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex is a key mediator of this transcriptional response. We found that a glutamine-rich low complexity sequence (QLC) in the SNF5 subunit of this complex, and histidines within this sequence, were required for efficient transcriptional reprogramming during carbon starvation. Furthermore, the SNF5 QLC mediated pH-dependent recruitment of SWI/SNF to a model promoter in vitro. Simulations showed that protonation of histidines within the SNF5 QLC lead to conformational expansion, providing a potential biophysical mechanism for regulation of these interactions. Together, our results indicate that that pH changes are a second messenger for transcriptional reprogramming during carbon starvation, and that the SNF5 QLC acts as a pH-sensor.",

    "abstract": "Modules of interacting proteins regulate vesicle budding and fusion in eukaryotes. Distinct paralogous copies of these modules act at distinct sub-cellular locations. The processes by which such large gene modules are duplicated and retained remain unclear. Here we show that interspecies hybridization is a potent source of paralogous gene modules. We study the dynamics of paralog doublets derived from the 100-million-year-old hybridization event that gave rise to the whole genome duplication clade of budding yeast. We show that paralog doublets encoding vesicle traffic proteins are convergently retained across species. Vesicle coats and adaptors involved in secretory and early-endocytic pathways are retained as doublets, while tethers and other machinery involved in intra-Golgi traffic and later endocytic steps are reduced to singletons. These patterns reveal common selective pressures that have sculpted traffic pathways in diverse yeast species. They suggest that hybridization may have played a pivotal role in the expansion of the endomembrane system.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe rice weevil Sitophilus oryzae is one of the most important agricultural pests, causing extensive damage to cereal in fields and to stored grains. S. oryzae has an intracellular symbiotic relationship (endosymbiosis) with the Gram-negative bacterium Sodalis pierantonius and is a valuable model to decipher host-symbiont molecular interactions.\n\nResultsWe sequenced the Sitophilus oryzae genome using a combination of short and long reads to produce the best assembly for a Curculionidae species to date. We show that S. oryzae has undergone successive bursts of transposable element (TE) amplification, representing 72% of the genome. In addition, we show that many TE families are transcriptionally active, and changes in their expression are associated with insect endosymbiotic state. S. oryzae has undergone a high gene expansion rate, when compared to other beetles. Reconstruction of host-symbiont metabolic networks revealed that, despite its recent association with cereal weevils (30 Kyear), S. pierantonius relies on the host for several amino acids and nucleotides to survive and to produce vitamins and essential amino-acids required for insect development and cuticle biosynthesis.\n\nConclusionsHere we present the genome of an agricultural pest beetle, which may act as a foundation for pest control. In addition, S. oryzae may be a useful model for endosymbiosis, and studying TE evolution and regulation, along with the impact of TEs on eukaryotic genomes.",

    "abstract": "The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 virus (SARS-CoV-2) poses a worldwide human health crisis, causing respiratory illness with a high mortality rate. To investigate the factors governing codon usage bias in all the respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 isolates from different geographical locations (~62K), including two recently emerging strains from the United Kingdom (UK), i.e., VUI202012/01 and South Africa (SA), i.e., 501.Y.V2 codon usage bias (CUBs) analysis was performed. The analysis includes RSCU analysis, GC content calculation, ENC analysis, dinucleotide frequency and neutrality plot analysis. We were motivated to conduct the study to fulfil two primary aims: first, to identify the difference in codon usage bias amongst all SARS-CoV-2 genomes and, secondly, to compare their CUBs properties with other respiratory viruses. A biased nucleotide composition was found as most of the highly preferred codons were A/U-ending in all the respiratory viruses studied here. Compared with the human host, the RSCU analysis led to the identification of 11 over-represented codons and 9 under-represented codons in SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Correlation analysis of ENC and GC3s revealed that mutational pressure is the leading force determining the CUBs. The present study results yield a better understanding of codon usage preferences for SARS-CoV-2 genomes and discover the possible evolutionary determinants responsible for the biases found among the respiratory viruses, thus unveils a unique feature of the SARS-CoV-2 evolution and adaptation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at comparative CUBs analysis on the worldwide genomes of SARS-CoV-2, including novel emerged strains and other respiratory viruses.",

However, the plausibility of this hypothetical process and the number of productive evolutionary trajectories in sequence space are unknown. Here we demonstrate that function can arise starting from a single RNA sequence by an iterative process of mutation and selection. Specifically, we describe the discovery of both specific ATP or GTP aptamers - with micromolar affinity for their nucleotide ligand - starting each from a single, homopolymeric poly-A sequence flanked by conserved primer binding sites. Our results indicate that the ab initio presence of large, diverse random sequence pools is not a prerequisite for the emergence of functional RNAs and that the process of Darwinian evolution has the capacity to generate function even from single, largely unstructured RNA sequences with minimal molecular and informational complexity.",

The remarkable success in treatment of HR repair deficient cancers has not translated to HR-proficient cancer. Our studies identify the mechanism of non-receptor lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) in HR repair in endometrioid epithelial ovarian cancer (eEOC). LCK expression is induced and activation in the nucleus in response to DNA damage insult. LCK inhibition attenuates expression of RAD51, BRCA1, and BRCA2 proteins necessary for HR-mediated DNA repair, sufficient to suppress RAD51 foci formation, and augments {gamma}H2AX foci formation. Mechanistically, DNA damage leads to direct interaction of LCK with RAD51 and BRCA1 in a kinase dependent manner. Attenuation of LCK sensitized HR-proficient eEOC cells to PARP inhibitor in cell culture and pre-clinical mouse studies. These findings identify a new mechanism for expanding utility of PARP inhibitors in HR proficient ovarian cancer.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=120 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/433791v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (33K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1715c60org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@167cb5forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@158d807org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ced201_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Loneliness is a painful condition associated with increased risk for premature mortality. The formation of new, positive social relationships can alleviate feelings of loneliness, but requires rapid trustworthiness decisions during initial encounters and it is still unclear how loneliness hinders interpersonal trust. Here, we use a multimodal approach including behavioral, psychophysiological, hormonal, and neuroimaging measurements to probe a trust-based mechanism underlying impaired social interactions in loneliness. Pre-stratified healthy individuals with high loneliness scores (n = 42 out of a screened sample of 3678 adults) show reduced oxytocinergic and affective responsiveness to a positive conversation, report less interpersonal trust, and prefer larger social distances compared to controls (n = 40). Moreover, lonely individuals are rated as less trustworthy compared to controls and identified by the blinded confederate better than chance. During initial trust decisions, lonely individuals exhibit attenuated limbic and striatal activation and blunted functional connectivity between the anterior insula and occipitoparietal regions, which correlates with the diminished affective responsiveness to the positive social interaction. This neural response pattern is not mediated by loneliness-associated psychological symptoms. Thus, our results indicate compromised integration of trust-related information as a shared neurobiological component in loneliness, yielding a reciprocally reinforced trust bias in social dyads.",

    "abstract": "The functional organization of neural processes is constrained by the brain s intrinsic structural connectivity. Here, we explore the potential of exploiting this structure in order to improve the signal representation properties of brain activity and its dynamics. Using a multi-modal imaging dataset (electroencephalography, structural MRI and diffusion MRI), we represent electrical brain activity at the cortical surface as a time-varying composition of harmonic modes of structural connectivity. The harmonic modes are termed connectome harmonics, and their representation is known as the connectome spectrum of the signal. We found that: first, the brain activity signal is more compactly represented by the connectome spectrum than by the traditional area-based representation; second, the connectome spectrum characterizes fast brain dynamics in terms of signal broadcasting profile, revealing different temporal regimes of integration and segregation that are consistent across participants. And last, the connectome spectrum characterises fast brain dynamics with fewer degrees of freedom than area-based signal representations. Specifically, we show that with the connectome spectrum representation, fewer dimensions are needed to capture the differences between low-level and high-level visual processing, and the topological properties of the signal. In summary, this work provides statistical, functional and topological evidence supporting that by accounting for the brain s structural connectivity fosters a more comprehensive understanding of large-scale dynamic neural functioning.",

    "abstract": "Laminar BOLD-fMRI has been applied to better depict the neuronal input and output circuitry and functional connectivity across cortical layers by measuring local hemodynamic changes. Despite extensive studies detecting laminar fMRI signals to illustrate the canonical microcircuit, the spatiotemporal characteristics of laminar-specific information flow across different cortical regions remain to be fully investigated in both evoked and resting states. Here, we developed a multi-slice line-scanning fMRI (MS-LS) method to detect laminar fMRI signals in adjacent cortical regions with high spatial (50 {micro}m) and temporal resolution (100 ms) in anesthetized rats. Across different scanning trials, we detected both laminar-specific positive and negative BOLD responses in the surrounding cortical region adjacent to the most activated cortex under evoked condition. Specifically, in contrast to the typical Layer (L) 4 correlation across different regions due to the thalamocortical projections for trials with positive BOLD, a strong correlation pattern specific in L2/3 was detected for the trials with negative BOLD in adjacent regions, which indicate a brain state-dependent laminar-fMRI responses based on cortiocotical interaction from different trials. Also, we acquired the laminar-specific rs-fMRI signals across different cortical regions, of which the high spatiotemporal resolution allows us to estimate lag times based on the maximal cross-correlation of laminar-specific rs-fMRI signals. In contrast to the larger variability of lag times in L1 and 6, robust lag time differences in L2/3, 4, and 5 across multiple cortices represented the low-frequency rs-fMRI signal propagation from the caudal to the rostral slice. In summary, our work provides a unique laminar fMRI mapping scheme to better characterize trial-specific intra- and inter-laminar functional connectivity with MS-LS, presenting layer-specific spatiotemporal variation of both evoked and rs-fMRI signals.",

The key influence factors of spatial variation in land use are altitude; gradient; and the distance to rivers, highways and villages.

    "abstract": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significant and complex genetic etiology. GWAS studies have identified genetic variants associated with ASD, but the functional impacts of these variants remain unknown. Here, we integrated four distinct levels of biological information (GWAS, eQTL, spatial genome organization and protein-protein interactions) to identify potential regulatory impacts of ASD-associated SNPs (p < 5x10-8) on biological pathways within fetal and adult cortical tissues. We found 80 and 58 SNPs that mark regulatory regions (i.e. expression quantitative trait loci or eQTLs) in the fetal and adult cortex, respectively. These eQTLs were also linked to other psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia, ADHD, bipolar disorder). Functional annotation of ASD-associated eQTLs revealed that they are involved in diverse regulatory processes. In particular, we found significant enrichment of eQTLs within regions repressed by Polycomb proteins in the fetal cortex compared to the adult cortex. Furthermore, we constructed fetal and adult cortex-specific protein-protein interaction networks and identified that ASD-associated regulatory SNPs impact on immune pathways, fatty acid metabolism, ribosome biogenesis, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and spliceosome in the fetal cortex. By contrast in the adult cortex, they largely affect immune pathways. Overall, our findings highlight potential regulatory mechanisms and pathways important for the etiology of ASD in early brain development and adulthood. This approach, in combination with clinical studies on ASD, will contribute to individualized mechanistic understanding of ASD development.",

Although kinematics-based algorithms can also be used, their accuracy and generalisability are limited, often requiring corrections for speed or foot-strike pattern. The purpose of this study was to develop FootNet, a novel kinematics and deep learning-based algorithm for the detection of step events in treadmill running. Five treadmill running datasets were gathered and processed to obtain segment and joint kinematics, and to identify the contact phase within each gait cycle using force data. The proposed algorithm is based on a long short-term memory recurrent neural network and takes the distal tibia anteroposterior velocity, ankle dorsiflexion/plantar flexion angle and the anteroposterior and vertical velocities of the foot centre of mass as input features to predict the contact phase within a given gait cycle. The chosen model architecture underwent 5-fold cross-validation and the final model was tested in a subset of participants from each dataset (30%). Non-parametric Bland-Altman analyses (bias and [95% limits of agreement]) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were used to compare FootNet against the force data step event detection method. The association between detection errors and running speed, foot-strike angle and incline were also investigated. FootNet outperformed previously published algorithms (foot-strike bias = 0 [-10, 7] ms, RMSE = 5 ms; toe-off bias = 0 [-10, 10] ms, RMSE = 6 ms; and contact time bias = 0 [-15, 15] ms, RMSE = 8 ms) and proved robust to different running speeds, foot-strike angles and inclines. We have made FootNets source code publicly available for step event detection in treadmill running when force data are not available.",

    "abstract": "Many biological processes are mediated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Because protein domains are the building blocks of proteins, PPIs likely rely on domain-domain interactions (DDIs). Several attempts exist to infer DDIs from PPI networks but the produced datasets are heterogeneous and sometimes not accessible, while the PPI interactome data keeps growing.\n\nWe describe a new computational approach called \"PPIDM\" (Protein-Protein Interactions Domain Miner) for inferring DDIs using multiple sources of PPIs. The approach is an extension of our previously described \"CODAC\" (Computational Discovery of Direct Associations using Common neighbors) method for inferring new edges in a tripartite graph. The PPIDM method has been applied to seven widely used PPI resources, using as \"Gold-Standard\" a set of DDIs extracted from 3D structural databases. Overall, PPIDM has produced a dataset of 84, 552 non-redundant DDIs. Statistical significance (p-value) is calculated for each source of PPI and used to classify the PPIDM DDIs in Gold (9,175 DDIs), Silver (24, 934 DDIs) and Bronze (50, 443 DDIs) categories. Dataset comparison reveals that PPIDM has inferred from the 2017 releases of PPI sources about 46% of the DDIs present in the 2020 release of the 3did database, not counting the DDIs present in the Gold-Standard. The PPIDM dataset contains 10, 229 DDIs that are consistent with more than 13, 300 PPIs extracted from the IMEx database, and nearly 23,300 DDIs (27.5%) that are consistent with more than 214,000 human PPIs extracted from the STRING database. Examples of newly inferred DDIs covering more than 10 PPIs in the IMEx database are provided.\n\nFurther exploitation of the PPIDM DDI reservoir includes the inventory of possible partners of a protein of interest and characterization of protein interactions at the domain level in combination with other methods. The result is publicly available at http://ppidm.loria.fr/.\n\nAuthor summaryWe revisit at a large scale the question of inferring DDIs from PPIs. Compared to previous studies, we take a unified approach accross multiple sources of PPIs. This approach is a method for inferring new edges in a tripartite graph setting and can be compared to link prediction approaches in knowledge graphs. Aggregation of several sources is performed using an optimized weighted average of the individual scores calculated in each source. A huge dataset of over 84K DDIs is produced which far exceeds the previous datasets. We show that a significant portion of the PPIDM dataset covers a large number of PPIs from curated (IMEx) or non curated (STRING) databases. Such a reservoir of DDIs deserves further exploration and can be combined with high-throughput methods such as cross-linking mass spectrometry to identify plausible protein partners of proteins of interest.",

    "abstract": "Hybrid multiscale agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to simulate individual cell interactions and microenvironmental dynamics. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of modeling individual cells, the inherent stochasticity due to probabilistic phenotypic transitions, and numerous model parameters that are difficult to measure directly are fundamental limitations of applying such models to predict tumor dynamics. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a coarse-grained two-scale ABM (cgABM) calibrated with a set of time-resolved microscopy measurements of cancer cells grown with different initial conditions. The multiscale model consists of a reaction-diffusion type model capturing the spatio-temporal evolution of glucose and growth factors in the tumor microenvironment (at tissue scale), coupled with a lattice-free ABM to simulate individual cell dynamics (at cellular scale). The experimental data consists of BT474 human breast carcinoma cells initialized with different glucose concentrations and tumor cell confluences. The confluence of live and dead cells was measured every three hours over four days.   Given this model and data, we perform a global sensitivity analysis to identify the relative importance of the model parameters. The subsequent cgABM with a reduced parameter space is calibrated within a Bayesian framework to the experimental data to estimate model parameters, which are then used to predict the temporal evolution of the living and dead cell populations. To this end, a moment-based Bayesian inference is proposed to account for the stochasticity of the cgABM while quantifying uncertainties in model parameters and observational data. The results indicate that the cgABM can reliably predict the spatiotemporal evolution of breast cancer cells observed by the microscopy data with an average error and standard deviation for live and dead cells being 7.61 [[EQUATION]] 2.01 and 5.78 [[EQUATION]] 1.13, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a genetic disorder that is associated with multiple neurological manifestations. Previously, we demonstrated that Tsc1 loss in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) can cause altered social behavior in mice. Here, we performed detailed transcriptional and translational analyses of Tsc1-deficient PCs to understand the molecular alterations in these cells. We found that target transcripts of the Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) are reduced in mutant PCs with evidence of increased degradation. Surprisingly, we observed unchanged ribosomal binding for many of these genes using Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP). Finally, we found that the FMRP target, SHANK2, was reduced in PC synapses, suggesting that compensatory increases in ribosomal binding efficiency may be unable to overcome reduced transcript levels. These data further implicate dysfunction of FMRP and its targets in TSC and suggest that treatments aimed at restoring the function of these pathways may be beneficial.",

    "abstract": "Explicit rewards are commonly used to reinforce a behavior, a form of learning that engages the dopaminergic neuromodulatory system. In contrast, skill acquisition can display dramatic improvements from a social learning experience, even though the observer receives no explicit reward. Here, we test whether a dopaminergic signal contributes to social learning in naive gerbils that are exposed to, and learn from, a skilled demonstrator performing an auditory discrimination task. Following five exposure sessions, naive observer gerbils were allowed to practice the auditory task, and their performance was assessed across days. We first tested the effect of an explicit food reward in the observers compartment that was yoked to the demonstrators performance during exposure sessions. Naive observer gerbils with the yoked reward learned the discrimination task significantly faster, as compared to unrewarded observers. The effect of this explicit reward was abolished by administration of a D1/D5 dopamine receptor antagonist during the exposure sessions. Similarly, the D1/D5 antagonist reduced the rate of learning in unrewarded observers. To test whether a dopaminergic signal was sufficient to enhance social learning, we administered a D1/D5 receptor agonist during the exposure sessions in which no reward was present, and found that the rate of learning occurred significantly faster. Finally, a quantitative analysis of observer vocalizations and movements during the exposure sessions suggest behavioral strategies that contribute to social learning. Together, these results are consistent with a dopamine-dependent reward signal during social learning.",

    "abstract": "Face perception plays an important role in our daily social interactions, as it is essential to recognize emotions. The N170 Event Related Potential (ERP) component has been widely identified as a major face-sensitive neuronal marker. However, despite extensive investigations conducted to examine this electroencephalographic pattern, there is yet no agreement regarding its sensitivity to the content of facial expressions.\n\nHere, we aim to clarify the EEG signatures of the recognition of facial expressions by investigating ERP components that we hypothesize to be associated with this cognitive process. We asked the question whether the recognition of facial expressions is encoded by the N170 as weel as at the level of P100 and P250. In order to test this hypothesis, we analysed differences in amplitudes and latencies for the three ERPs, in a sample of 20 participants. A visual paradigm requiring explicit recognition of happy, sad and neutral faces was used. The facial cues were explicitly controlled to vary only regarding mouth and eye components. We found that non neutral emotion expressions elicit a response difference in the amplitude of N170 and P250. In contrast with the P100, there by excluding a role for low level factors.\n\nOur study brings new light to the controversy whether emotional face expressions modulate early visual response components, which have been often analysed apart. The results support the tenet that neutral and emotional faces evoke distinct N170 patterns, but go further by revealing that this is also true for P250, unlike the P100.",

Pantoea sp. YR343, a gamma-proteobacterium isolated from the rhizosphere of Populus deltoides, forms robust biofilms along the root surfaces of Populus and possesses plant growth-promoting characteristics. The mechanisms governing biofilm formation along plant roots by bacteria, including Pantoea sp. YR343, are not fully understood and many genes involved in this process have yet to be discovered. In this work, we identified three diguanylate cyclases in the plant-associated microbe Pantoea sp. YR343 that are expressed in the presence of plant roots, One of these diguanylate cyclases, DGC2884 localizes to discrete sites in the cells and its overexpression results in reduced motility and increased EPS production and biofilm formation. We then performed a genetic screen by expressing this diguanylate cyclase from an inducible promoter in order to identify candidate downstream effectors of c-di-GMP signaling which may be involved in root colonization by Pantoea sp.

Further, we demonstrate the importance of other domains in DGC2884 to its activity, which in combination with the genes identified by transposon mutagenesis, may yield insights into activity and regulation of homologous enzymes in medically and agriculturally relevant microbes.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundIndoor residual spraying (IRS) is one of the main malaria vector control strategies in Mozambique alongside the distribution of insecticide treated nets. As part of the national insecticide resistance management strategy, Mozambique introduced SumiShield 50WG, a third generation IRS product, in 2018. Its residual efficacy was assessed in southern Mozambique during the 2018-2019 malaria season.\n\nMethodsTwo different wall surfaces, cement and mud-plastered surfaces, daily mosquito mortality up to 120 hours post-exposure, and older mosquitoes (13-26d old) were included in standard WHO (World Health Organization) cone bioassay tests. Lethal times (LT) 90, LT50 and LT10 were estimated using Bayesian models.\n\nResultsMortality 24h post exposure was consistently below 80%, the current WHO threshold value for effective IRS, in both young and old mosquitoes, regardless of wall surface type. Considering delayed mortality, residual efficacies (mosquito mortality equal or greater than 80%) ranged from 1 to [&ge;]12 months, with the duration depending on mortality time post exposure, wall type and mosquito age. Looking at mortality 72h after exposure, residual efficacy was between 6 and 9 months, depending on wall type and mosquito age. Mortality of older mosquitoes was significantly higher on mud-surfaces compared to cemented-surfaces 24h post exposure, but this difference was not significant for the delayed mortalities. The LT50 and LT10 (i.e. 90% of the mosquitoes survive exposure to the insecticides) values were consistently higher for older mosquitoes using the 24h post-exposure observations and ranged from 0.2 to 5.7 months and 0.2 to 7.2 months for LT50 and LT10, respectively.\n\nConclusionsThe present study highlights the need for assessing mosquito mortality beyond the currently recommended 24h post exposure. Failure to do so may lead to underestimation of the residual efficacy of IRS products, as delayed mortality will lead to a further reduction in mosquito vector populations and potentially negatively impact disease transmission. Monitoring residual efficacy on relevant wall surfaces, including old mosquitoes that are ultimately responsible for malaria transmission, and assessing delayed mortalities are critical to provide accurate and actionable data to guide vector control programmes.",

    "abstract": "For group-living species such as humans and rodents, conspecific interactions pervasively shape emotion (1-3), attention (4), and cognitive ability (5-8). Higher-order cognitive processes such as memory within a social brain are thus interlaced with social influences. Traditional laboratory rodent cages offer a limited but nonetheless rich multi-modal landscape of communication, including auditory calls (9-12), chemical signaling (13, 14), and tactile stimulation (15, 16). The absence of such social encounters in singly housed animals results in cognitive impairments and depression-like phenotypes (17), likely obscuring how the social brain has evolved to function. It is thus important to understand the relationship between social context and how individuals process memories. As social interaction recruits hippocampal (18) and amygdalar (19) circuitry that also serves as hubs for non-social memory traces(20-24), we hypothesized that pre-existing ensembles in these regions can be modulated by social experiences and lead to changes in memory expression. Here we show that stressful social experiences enhance the recall of previously acquired fear memories in male but not female mice. Activity-dependent tagging of cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) during fear learning revealed that these ensembles were endogenously reactivated during the social experiences in males. These reactivated cells were shown to be functional components of engrams, as optogenetic stimulation of the cells active during the social experience in previously fear conditioned animals was sufficient to drive fear-related behaviors. Our findings suggest that social encounters can reactivate pre-existing DG engrams and thereby strengthen discrete memories.\n\nSignificance StatementSocial environments can bolster and protect cognitive abilities. However, the relationship between social stimuli and individually learned memories remains enigmatic. Our work reveals that exposure to a stressed, naive non-familiar conspecific or to the ambient olfactory-auditory cues of a recently stressed familiar conspecific induces reactivation of the cellular ensembles associated with a fear memory in the hippocampus. Artificially activating the hippocampal ensemble active during the social experience induces fearful behaviors only in animals that have previously acquired a negative memory, suggesting a fear-driving function of the reactivated ensembles and demonstrating the interaction between individual history and social experience. The neural resurgence of fear-driving ensembles during social experiences leads to a context-specific enhancement of fear recall. Our findings provide evidence that unlike directly physical stressors, ambient social stimuli can reactivate and amplify an individuals memories.",

I show that circRNAs are highly expressed in the neurons of C. elegans and are preferably derived from neuronal genes. More importantly, reverse complementary matches in circRNA-flanking introns are not only required for back-splicing but also promote the skipping of exon(s) to be circularized. Interestingly, one pair of RCM in zip-2 is highly conserved across five nematode ortholog genes, which show conserved exon-skipping patterns. Finally, through one-by-one mutagenesis of all the splicing sites and branch points required for exon-skipping and back-splicing in the zip-2 gene, I show that exon-skipping is not absolutely required for back-splicing, neither the other way.

    "abstract": "Plants use odors not only to recruit other organisms for symbioses, but to  talk to each other. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from \"emitting\" plants inform the \"receiving\" (listening) plants of impending stresses or simply of their presence. However, the receptors that allow receivers to perceive the volatile cue are elusive. Most likely, plants (as animals) have odorant bind proteins (OBPs), and in fact few OBPs are known to bind \"stress-induced\" plant VOCs. We investigated whether OBPs may bind volatile constitutive and stress-induced isoprenoids, the most emitted plant VOCs, with well-established roles in plant communication. First, we performed a data base search that generated a list of candidate plant OBPs. Second, we investigated in silico the ability of the identified candidate plant OBPs to bind VOCs by molecular simulation experiments. Our results show that monoterpenes can bind the same OBPs that were described to bind other stress-induced VOCs. Whereas, the constitutive hemiterpene isoprene does not bind any investigated OBP and may not have an info-chemical role. We conclude that, as for animal, plant OBPs may bind different VOCs. Despite being generalist and not specialized, plant OBPs may play an important role in allowing plants to eavesdrop messages sent by neighboring plants.",

Finally, modulation in response to reversal learning and compulsive behavior are independent, as reversal learning-associated neurons are distributed randomly amongst grooming-associated neurons (i.e. overlap is what would be expected by chance).\n\nConclusionsIn OCD, the LOFC is disrupted during both compulsive behaviors and reversal learning, yet whether these behaviors share common neural underpinnings is unknown. We find that the LOFC plays distinct and independent roles in compulsive grooming and impaired reversal learning and their improvement with fluoxetine. These findings suggest that LOFC plays separate roles in pathophysiology and treatment of different perseverative behaviors in OCD.",

    "abstract": "H-NS family proteins, bacterial xenogeneic silencers, play central roles in genome organization and in the regulation of foreign genes. It is thought that gene repression is directly dependent on the DNA binding modes of H-NS family proteins. These proteins form lateral protofilaments along DNA. Under specific environmental conditions they switch to bridging two DNA duplexes. This switching is a direct effect of environmental conditions on electrostatic interactions between the oppositely charged DNA binding and N-terminal domains of H-NS proteins. The Pseudomonas lytic phage LUZ24 encodes the early protein gp4, which modulates the DNA binding and function of the H-NS family protein MvaT of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. However, the mechanism by which gp4 modulates MvaT activity remains elusive. In this study, we show that gp4 specifically interferes with the formation and stability of the bridged MvaT-DNA complex. Structural investigations suggest that gp4 acts as an \"electrostatic zipper\" between the oppositely charged domains of MvaT protomers, and stabilizes a structure resembling their \"half-open\" conformation, resulting in relief of gene silencing and adverse effects on P. aeruginosa growth. The ability to control H-NS conformation and thereby its impact on global gene regulation and growth might open new avenues to fight Pseudomonas multidrug resistance.",

    "abstract": "The current COVID-19 pandemic represents a global challenge. A better understanding of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 is key to unveil the differences in disease severity and to develop future vaccines targeting novel SARS-CoV-2 variants. Feature barcode technology combined with CITE-seq antibodies and DNA-barcoded peptide-MHC I Dextramer reagents enabled us to identify relevant SARS-CoV-2-derived epitopes and compare epitope-specific CD8+ T cell populations between mild and severe COVID-19. We identified a strong CD8+ T cell response against an S protein-derived epitope. CD8+ effector cells in severe COVID-19 displayed hyperactivation, T cell exhaustion and were missing characteristics of long-lived memory T cells. We identify A*0101 WTAGAAAYY as an immunogenic CD8+ T cell epitope with the ability to drive clonal expansion. We provide an in-depth characterization of the CD8+ T cell-mediated response to SARS-CoV-2 infection which will be relevant for the development of molecular and targeted therapies and potential adjustments of vaccination strategies.",

    "abstract": "Migrating cells must interpret chemical gradients to guide themselves within tissues. A general premise has been that gradients influence the direction of leading-edge protrusions. However, recent evidence indicates that actin flows correlate better with directed motion than protrusions. A unified chemotaxis model that integrates the role of protrusions and actin flows and that accounts for in vivo cell motion patterns is lacking. Here, we provide direct experimental evidence of how neutrophils sense gradients in real-time in vivo and demonstrate a two-stage process: first a  search phase, that requires actin network expansion by Arp2/3, whereby cells slow down, explore the environment and execute path corrections. This is followed by a  run phase, that requires Myosin-II-driven contractility and fast actin flows, whereby cells accelerate and persist in the source direction. Thus, protrusive forces support chemotaxis by enhancing signal detection, while actin flows act as the ultimate output of gradient processing.",

    "abstract": "Glia maturation factor beta (GMFB) is a growth and differentiation factor that act as an intracellular regulator of signal transduction pathways. The SUMOylation is a post-translational modification (PTM) that plays a key role in protein subcellular localization, stability, transcription, and enzymatic activity. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of SUMOylation in the inflammation and progression of numerous diseases. But little is known about the relationship between GMFB and SUMOylation. Here we first report that GMFB can be mono-SUMOylated at multiple sites by the covalent addition of a single SUMO1 protein, and identified K20, K35, K58, and K97 as major SUMO acceptor sites. We also found that SUMOylation leading to increased stability and trans-localization of GMFB. Furthermore, RNA-seq data and Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (rt-qPCR) also indicated that the SUMOylated GMFB upregulated multiple pathways, including the cytokine-cytokin receptor interaction, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway, and NF-kappa B signaling pathway. Our studies intend to provide a novel direction for the study into the biofunction of GMFB, SUMOylated GMFB and the mechanism, clinical therapy, and prognosis of inflammation-related RPE disorders like age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).",

    "abstract": "Grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) is one of the most significant crops in the world. Todays richness in grapevine diversity results from a complex domestication history over multiple historical periods. Here, we employed whole genome resequencing to elucidate different aspects of the recent evolutionary history of this crop. Our results support a model in which a central domestication event in grapevine was followed by post-domestication hybridization with local wild genotypes, leading to the presence of an introgression signature in modern wine varieties across Western Europe. The strongest signal was associated with a subset of Iberian grapevine varieties, which show large introgression tracts. We targeted this study group for further analysis, demonstrating how regions under selection in wild populations from the Iberian Peninsula were preferentially passed on to the cultivated varieties by geneflow. Examination of underlying genes suggests that environmental adaptation played a fundamental role in both the evolution of wild genotypes and the outcome of hybridization with cultivated varieties, supporting a case of adaptive introgression in grapevine.",

However, there remains a lack of model systems for investigating the critical cardio-pulmonary mutual interaction during human embryogenesis. Here, we reported a novel stepwise strategy for directing simultaneous induction of both mesoderm-derived cardiac and endoderm-derived lung epithelial lineages within a single differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) via temporal specific tuning of WNT and TGF-{beta} signaling in the absence of exogenous growth factors. Using 3D suspension culture, we established concentric cardio-pulmonary micro-Tissues (Ts), and observed expedited alveolar maturation in the presence of cardiac accompany. Upon withdrawal of WNT agonist, the cardiac and pulmonary components within each dual-lineage T effectively segregated from each other with concurrent initiation of cardiac contraction. We expect our multilineage differentiation model to offer an experimentally tractable system for investigating human cardio-pulmonary interplay and tissue boundary formation during embryogenesis.",

Using a range of molecular, genomic, and physiological techniques, we identify and characterize motor neurons and skeletal muscle, along with sensory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and vasculature. Organoid cultures derived from ALS subject iPSC lines and isogenic lines edited to harbor familial ALS mutations all show impairment at the level of the NMJ, as detected by both contraction and immunocytochemical measurements.

    "abstract": "Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the first intron of the FTO gene (alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase) identified by a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 2007 continue to be the known variants with the greatest effect on adiposity in different human populations. Currently available data reveal a total of 61 different intronic SNPs associated with adiposity. Coding variants in the FTO gene, on the other hand, have been little explored, but data from complete sequencing of the exomes of various populations are available in public databases and provide an excellent opportunity to investigate potential functional variants in FTO. This study aimed to track nonsynonymous variants in the exons of the FTO gene in different population groups using the ExAC database (gnomAD) (http://exac.broadinstitute.org/) and to analyze the potential functional impact of these variants on the FTO protein. Variants were analyzed using five publicly available pathogenicity prediction programs. Of the 158 mutations identified (152 missense and 6 stop-gain), 64 (40.5%) were classified as pathogenic, 67 (42.4%) were classified as benign, and 27 (17%) were classified as inconclusive. Thirty variants were classified as pathogenic by all five predictors used in this study, and 16 mutations were classified as pathogenic by only one predictor. The largest number of mutations was found in Europeans (non-Finnish) (85/158), all with very low frequencies, and half (32/64) of the variants classified as pathogenic by the five predictors used were also found in this population. The data obtained in this analysis show that a large number of rare coding variants classified as pathogenic or potentially pathogenic by different in silico pathogenicity prediction programs are not detected by GWAS due to the low linkage disequilibrium as well as the limitations of GWAS in capturing rare variants present in less than 1.0% of the population.",
