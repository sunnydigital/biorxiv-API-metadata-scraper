    "abstract": "Visuomotor adaptation has one of the oldest experimental histories in psychology and neuroscience, yet its precise nature has always been a topic of debate. Here we offer a survey and synthesis of recent work on visuomotor adaptation that we hope will prove illuminating for this ongoing dialogue. We discuss three types of error signals that drive learning in adaptation tasks: task performance error, sensory prediction-error, and a binary target hitting error. Each of these errors has been shown to drive distinct learning processes. Namely, both target hitting errors and putative sensory prediction-errors drive an implicit change in visuomotor maps, while task performance error drives learning of explicit strategy use and non-motor decision-making. Each of these learning processes contributes to the overall learning that takes place in visuomotor adaptation tasks, and although the learning processes and error signals are independent, they interact in a complex manner. We outline many task contexts where the operation of these processes is counter-intuitive and offer general guidelines for their control, measurement and interpretation. We believe this new framework unifies several disparate threads of research in sensorimotor adaptation that often seem in conflict. We conclude by explaining how this more nuanced understanding of errors and learning processes could lend itself to the analysis of other types of sensorimotor adaptation, of motor skill learning, of the neural processing underlying sensorimotor adaptation in humans, of animal models and of brain computer interfaces.",

    "abstract": "Current influenza vaccines need to be updated annually due to mutations in the globular head of the viral surface protein, hemagglutinin (HA). To address this, vaccine candidates have been designed based on the relatively conserved HA stem domain and have shown protective efficacy in animal models. Oligomerization of the antigens either by fusion to oligomerization motifs or display on self-assembling nanoparticle scaffolds, can induce more potent immune responses compared to the corresponding monomeric antigen due to multivalent engagement of B-cells. Since nanoparticle display can increase manufacturing complexity, and often involves one or more mammalian cell expressed components, it is important to characterize and compare various display and oligomerization scaffolds. Using a structure guided approach, we successfully displayed multiple copies of a previously designed soluble, trimeric influenza stem domain immunogen, pH1HA10, on the ferritin like protein, MsDps2 (12 copies), Ferritin (24 copies) and Encapsulin (180 copies). All proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. The nanoparticle fusion immunogens were found to be well folded and bound to the influenza stem directed broadly neutralizing antibodies with high affinity. An 8.5 [A] Cryo-EM map of Msdps2-pH1HA10 confirmed the successful design of the nanoparticle fusion immunogen. Mice immunization studies with the soluble trimeric stem and nanoparticle fusion constructs revealed that all of them were immunogenic, and protected mice against homologous (A/Belgium/145-MA/2009) and heterologous (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934) challenge with 10MLD50 mouse adapted virus. Although nanoparticle display conferred a small but statistically significant improvement in protection relative to the soluble trimer in a homologous challenge, heterologous protection was similar in both nanoparticle-stem immunized and trimeric stem immunized groups. Such rapidly producible, bacterially expressed antigens and nanoparticle scaffolds are useful modalities to tackle future influenza pandemics.",

    "abstract": "Cells must replicate and segregate their DNA with precision. In eukaryotes, these processes are part of a regulated cell-cycle that begins at S-phase with the replication of DNA and ends after M-phase. Previous studies showed that these processes were present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor and the core parts of their molecular systems are conserved across eukaryotic diversity. However, some unicellular parasites, such as the metamonad Giardia intestinalis, have secondarily lost components of the DNA processing and segregation apparatuses. To clarify the evolutionary history of these systems in these unusual eukaryotes, we generated a high-quality draft genome assembly for the free-living metamonad Carpediemonas membranifera and carried out a comparative genomics analysis. We found that parasitic and free-living metamonads harbor a conspicuously incomplete set of canonical proteins for processing and segregating DNA. Unexpectedly, Carpediemonas species are further streamlined, lacking the origin recognition complex, Cdc6 and other replisome components, most structural kinetochore subunits including the Ndc80 complex, as well as several canonical cell-cycle checkpoint proteins. Carpediemonas is the first eukaryote known to have lost this large suite of conserved complexes, suggesting that it has a highly unusual cell cycle and that unlike any other known eukaryote, it must rely on novel or alternative set of mechanisms to carry out these fundamental processes.",

    "abstract": "Inhibition, the ability to withhold a response or to stop an initiated response, is a necessary cognitive function that can be vulnerable to an impairment. High levels of impulsivity have been shown to impact response inhibition and/or cognitive task performance. The present study investigated the spectral and spatio-temporal dynamics of response inhibition, during a combined go/no-go/stop-signal task, using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a healthy undergraduate student population. Participants were divided by their level of impulsivity, as assessed by self-report measures, to explore potential differences between high (n=17) and low (n=17) impulsivity groups. Results showed that individuals scoring high on impulsivity failed significantly more NOGO and STOP trials than those scoring low, but no significant differences were found between stop-signal reaction times. During NOGO and STOP conditions, high impulsivity individuals showed significantly smaller M1 components in posterior regions, which could suggest an attentional processing deficit. During NOGO trials, the M2 component was found to be reduced in individuals scoring high, possibly reflecting less pre-motor inhibition efficiency, whereas in STOP trials, the network involved in the stopping process was engaged later in high impulsivity individuals. The high impulsivity group also engaged frontal networks more during the STOP-M3 component only, possibly as a late compensatory process. The lack of response time differences on STOP trials could indicate that compensation was effective to some degree (at the expense of higher error rates). Decreased frontal delta and theta band power was observed in high impulsivity individuals, suggesting a possible deficit in frontal pathways involved in motor suppression, however, unexpectedly, increased delta and theta band power in central and posterior sensors was also observed, which could be indicative of an increased effort to compensate for frontal deficits. Individuals scoring highly also showed decreased alpha power in frontal sensors, suggesting decreased inhibitory processing, along with reduced alpha suppression in posterior regions, reflecting reduced cue processing. These results provide evidence for how personality traits, such as impulsivity, relate to differences in the neural correlates of response inhibition.",

    "abstract": "Key steps in viral propagation, immune suppression, and pathology are mediated by direct, binary, physical interactions between viral and host proteins. To understand the biology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, we generated an unbiased systematic map of binary interactions between viral and host proteins, complementing previous co-complex association maps by conveying more direct mechanistic understanding and potentially enabling targeted disruption of direct interactions. To this end, we deployed two parallel strategies, identifying 205 virus-host and 27 intraviral binary interactions amongst 171 host and 19 viral proteins, and confirming high quality of these interactions via a calibrated orthogonal assay. Host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV-2 proteins are enriched in various cellular processes, including immune signaling and inflammation, protein ubiquitination, and membrane trafficking. Specific subnetworks provide new hypotheses related to viral modulation of host protein homeostasis and T-cell regulation. The binary virus-host protein interactions we identified can now be prioritized as targets for therapeutic intervention. More generally, we provide a resource of systematic maps describing which SARS-CoV-2 and human proteins interact directly.",

    "abstract": "The global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and has infected over 100 million and caused over 2 million fatalities worldwide at the point of writing. There is currently a lack of effective drugs to treat people infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) is a superfamily1B helicase that has been identified as a possible target for anti-viral drugs due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. In this study we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP). Comparisons of these structures reveal details of global and local conformational changes that are induced by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. Structural analysis reveals two pockets on NSP13 that are classified as \"druggable\" and include one of the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. To identify possible starting points for anti-viral drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase. The fragment screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets, with hot spots in pockets predicted to be of functional importance, including the druggable nucleotide and nucleic acid binding sites, opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.",

    "abstract": "Purine auxotrophy is a typical marker for many laboratory yeast strains. Supplementation of additional purine source (like adenine) is necessary to cultivate these strains. If not supplied in adequate amounts, purine starvation sets in. We tested purine starvation effects in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae ade8 knockout. We explored effects brought by purine starvation in cellular, central carbon metabolism and in the global transcriptome level.\n\nWe observed that cells cultivated in purine depleted media became significantly more tolerant to severe thermal, oxidative and desiccation stresses when compared to the cells cultivated in media with all necessary supplements. When starved for purine, cells stop their cell cycle in G1 or G0 state; intracellular concentration of ATP, ADP and AMP decreases, but adenylate charge remains stable. Intracellular RNA concentration decreases and massive downregulation of ribosomal RNA occurs.\n\nWe think that purine auxotrophic starvation in a way mimics \"natural\" nitrogen or carbon starvations and therefore initiates elements of a transcriptional program typical for stationary phase cells (cell cycle arrest, increased stress resistance). Therefore our results demonstrate that organised metabolic response is initiated not only via \"natural starvations\", but also when starving for metabolic intermediates, like purines.",

    "abstract": "In this report, we investigate the evolution of transcription factor NF-{kappa}B by examining its structure, activity, and regulation in two protists using phylogenetic, cellular, and biochemical techniques. In Capsaspora owczarzaki (Co), we find that full-length NF-{kappa}B has an N-terminal DNA-binding domain and a C-terminal Ankyrin (ANK) repeat inhibitory domain, and its DNA-binding activity is more similar to metazoan NF-{kappa}B rather than Rel proteins. As with mammalian NF-{kappa}B proteins, removal of the ANK repeats is required for Co-NF-{kappa}B to enter the nucleus, bind DNA, and activate transcription. However, C-terminal processing of Co-NF-{kappa}B is not induced by co-expression of IKK in human cells. Exogenously expressed Co-NF-{kappa}B localizes to the nucleus in Co cells. NF-{kappa}B mRNA and DNA-binding levels differ across three life stages of Capsaspora, suggesting distinct roles for NF-{kappa}B in these life stages. RNA-seq and GO analyses identify possible gene targets and biological functions of Co-NF-{kappa}B. We also show that three NF-{kappa}B-like proteins from the choanoflagellate Acanthoeca spectabilis (As) all consist of primarily the N-terminal conserved Rel Homology domain sequences of NF-{kappa}B, and lack C-terminal ANK repeats. All three As-NF-{kappa}B proteins constitutively enter the nucleus of human and Co cells, but differ in their DNA-binding and transcriptional activation activities. Furthermore, all three As-NF-{kappa}B proteins can form heterodimers, indicating that NF-{kappa}B diversified into multi-subunit families at least two times during evolution. Overall, these results present the first functional characterization of NF-{kappa}B in a taxonomic kingdom other than Animalia and provide information about the evolution and diversification of this biologically important transcription factor.\n\nSignificanceThese results represent the first functional characterization of the biologically important transcription factor NF-{kappa}B in a taxonomic kingdom other than Animalia. As such, they provide information on the evolutionary origins and basal diversification of NF-{kappa}B outside of metazoans. These results suggest that NF-{kappa}B plays life stage-specific roles in Capsaspora, the closest unicellular ancestor to all metazoans. Finally, the analysis of three NF-{kappa}B proteins in a single choanoflagellate indicates that choanoflagellates have subclasses of NF-{kappa}Bs, which can form heterodimers, suggesting that NF-{kappa}B subunit expansion and diversification has occurred at least twice in evolution.",

Here, we show that during SARS-CoV-2 infection, all three proteins become lipid modified, through action of the S-acyltransferase ZDHHC20. Particularly striking is the rapid acylation of Spike on 10 cytosolic cysteines within the ER and Golgi. Using a combination of computational, lipidomics and biochemical approaches, we show that this massive lipidation controls Spike biogenesis and degradation, and drives the formation of localized ordered cholesterol and sphingolipid rich lipid nanodomains, in the early Golgi where viral budding occurs. ZDHHC20-mediated acylation allows the formation of viruses with enhanced fusion capacity and overall infectivity. Our study points towards S-acylating enzymes and lipid biosynthesis enzymes as novel therapeutic anti-viral targets.",

    "abstract": "In preimplantation embryos, an abnormal chromosome number causes developmental failure and a reduction in the pregnancy rate. Conventional chromosome testing methods requiring biopsy reduce the risk of associated genetic diseases; nevertheless, the reduction in cell number also reduces the pregnancy rate. Therefore, we attempted to count the chromosomes in mouse (Slc:ICR) embryos using super-resolution live-cell imaging as a new method of chromosome counting that does not reduce the cell number or viability. We counted the forty chromosomes at the first mitosis by injecting embryos with histone H2B-mCherry mRNA under conditions by which pups could be obtained; however, the results were often an underestimation of chromosome number and varied by embryo and time point. Therefore, we developed a method to count the chromosomes via CRISPR/dCas-mediated live-cell fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the sequence of the centromere region, enabling us to count the chromosomes more accurately in mouse embryos. The methodology presented here may provide useful information for assisted reproductive technologies, such as those used in livestock animals/humans, as a technique for assessing the chromosomal integrity of embryos prior to transfer.\n\nImpact StatementLow-toxic super-resolution observation enables chromosome counting in preimplantation embryos without cell collection.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the development of suckling piglets using morphometric parameters. Different models were created to predict the probability to occur any of the three weight classes (light, medium, and heavy) based on the piglets weaning weight. The variables in this research were birth weight (PWB), lactation length (Lac), and morphometric parameters- body length (BL), heart girth (HG), body mass index (BMI), ponderal index (PI), surface-mass ratio (SM), and birth order (BO). An adjustment of the ordinal regression was proposed to predict the weight classifications. The model with a significant effect of the Lac variables was selected. The light and heavy piglets, regardless of their morphometry, have a high chance of staying in the same weight class at weaning. However, this does not occur in medium piglets with diverse morphometry.\n\nSummary statementThis manuscript demonstrates how morphometry can influence the development of animals, even with similar weights.",

    "abstract": "Disease, ocean warming, and pollution have caused catastrophic declines in the cover of living coral on reefs across the Caribbean. Subsequently, reef-building corals have been replaced by invertebrates and macroalgae, leading to changes in ecological functioning. We describe changes in benthic community composition and cover at 15 sites across the Belizean Barrier Reef (BBR) following numerous major disturbances--bleaching, storms, and disease outbreaks--over the 20-year period 1997-2016. We tested the role of potential drivers of change on coral reefs, including local human impacts and ocean temperature. From 1997 to 2016, mean coral cover significantly declined from 26.3% to 10.7%, while macroalgal cover significantly increased from 12.9% to 39.7%. We documented a significant decline over time of the reef-building corals Orbicella spp. and described a major shift in benthic composition between early sampling years (1997-2005) and later years (2009-2016). The covers of hard-coral taxa, including Acropora spp., M. cavernosa, Orbicella spp., and Porites spp., were negatively related to marine heatwave frequency. Only gorgonian cover was related, negatively, to our metric of the magnitude of local impacts (the Human Influence Index). Changes in benthic composition and cover were not associated with local protection or fishing. This result is concordant with studies throughout the Caribbean that have documented living coral decline and shifts in reef-community composition following disturbances, regardless of local fisheries restrictions. Our results suggest that benthic communities along the BBR have experienced disturbances that are beyond the capacity of the current management structure to mitigate. We recommend that managers devote greater resources and capacity to enforce and expand existing marine protected areas and that government, industry, and the public act to reduce global carbon emissions.",

    "abstract": "An infective prey has the potential to infect, kill and consume its predator. Such a prey-predator relationship fundamentally differs from the classical Lotka-Volterra predator-prey premise because the prey can directly profit from the predator as a growth resource. Here we present a population dynamics model of partial role reversal in the predator-prey interaction. We parametrize the model to represent the predator-prey interaction of sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus and bacterium Vibrio splendidus. We observe that two major factors stabilize the predator-prey interaction. First, the partial role reversal in the predator-prey community stabilizes the predator-prey interaction. Second, if the predator is a generalist and follows the type I functional response in attacking the prey, the predator-prey interaction is stable. We also analysed the conditions for species extinction. The extinction of the prey, V. splendidus, may occur when its growth rate is low, or in the absence of infectivity. The extinction of the predator, A. japonicus, may follow if either the infectivity of the prey is high or a moderately infective prey is abundant. We conclude that partial role reversal is an underestimated subject in predator-prey studies.",

Despite its wide distributions, information on phylogeography and its determinant factors influencing A. albopictus genetic diversity and speciation is still lacking, mainly in SE Asia country. Considering this, the phylogeography of A. albopictus along with its genetic attributes in Indonesia has been assessed. The results identify that there are 2 distinct clades of A. albopictus phylogeography. First clade was related to the human-mediated dissemination. Relative Synonymous Codon Usage (RSCU) shows the TTG, CTG, GTG, ACG, GCG, and GGG codons were seldom represented. While GGA, CGA, and followed by TAT, CAT, CCT, TCT, AAC, and TTC codons were common. From a total of 60 codons, 40% codon has RSCU > 1and 21.6 % has RSCU < 1. The differences between west and east part populations can be observed in proline amino acid signaled by CCT and CCC codons. In this amino acid, east A. albopictus has higher CCC than CCT codons. Since proline is functioned to provide energy for flight, then the differences of this proline related codon among A. albopictus populations were related to the landscape variations in west and east parts of Indonesia with east parts have more rugged landscape and this condition is quite demanding for aerial animal distribution since it requires more flight energy.",

    "abstract": "The Japanese pygmy octopus Octopus parvus is a small octopus that occurs commonly along the coast of southern Japan, and is caught using traditional fishing methods. To date, however, there have been no studies on the ecology of this species. In this study, we investigated the annual seasonal occurrence of O. parvus in the intertidal zone of Fukue Island, Nagasaki, Japan, and examined the growth, maturation, and feeding habits of this octopus. We accordingly found that the octopus inhabits the intertidal zone of the study site from August to January, during which time it appears to move from the high to low intertidal zone, and subsequently migrates to the subtidal zone. During low tide at night in the intertidal zone, we observed that the octopuses actively captured and fed on prey, such as fish, crabs, hermit crabs, shrimp, snails, and bivalves. Both males and females were found to be characterized by similar body sizes and growth, although gonadal development occurs relatively earlier in males. However, any mating or brooding behaviors were not observed during the course of the study. Our observations thus indicate that O. parvus uses intertidal zones as feeding grounds for rapid growth and maturation, and may thereafter move to the subtidal zone for spawning.",

An inverse relationship between the growth rates of both species is shown, where P. polycephalum has positive growth when the red yeast has a negative growth rate and vice versa. The data also captures successional/oscillatory dynamics between both species. An advanced image analysis methodology for semantic segmentation is used to quantify population density over time, for all components of the ecosystem. We suggest that P. polycephalum is capable of exhibiting a sustainable feeding strategy by depositing a nutritive slime trail, allowing yeast to serve as a periodic food source. This opens a new direction of P. polycephalum research, where the population dynamics of spatial ecosystems can be readily quantified and complex ecological dynamics can be studied.",

    "abstract": "Ancient human migrations led to the settlement of population groups in varied environmental contexts worldwide. The extent to which adaptation to local environments has shaped human genetic diversity is a longstanding question in human evolution. Recent studies have suggested that introgression of archaic alleles in the genome of modern humans may have contributed to adaptation to environmental pressures such as pathogen exposure. Functional genomic studies have demonstrated that variation in gene expression across individuals and in response to environmental perturbations is a main mechanism underlying complex trait variation. We considered gene expression response to in vitro treatments as a molecular phenotype to identify genes and regulatory variants that may have played an important role in adaptations to local environments. We investigated if Neanderthal introgression in the human genome may contribute to the transcriptional response to environmental perturbations. To this end we used eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in a panel of 52 cellular environments, resulting from 5 cell types and 26 treatments, including hormones, vitamins, drugs, and environmental contaminants. We found that SNPs with introgressed Neanderthal alleles (N-SNPs) disrupt binding of transcription factors important for environmental responses, including ionizing radiation and hypoxia, and for glucose metabolism. We identified an enrichment for N-SNPs among eQTLs for genes differentially expressed in response to 8 treatments, including glucocorticoids, caffeine, and vitamin D. Using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRA) data, we validated the regulatory function of 21 introgressed Neanderthal variants in the human genome, corresponding to 8 eQTLs regulating 15 genes that respond to environmental perturbations. These findings expand the set of environments where archaic introgression may have contributed to adaptations to local environments in modern humans and provide experimental validation for the regulatory function of introgressed variants.",

    "abstract": "Vertebrate craniofacial morphogenesis is a highly orchestrated process that is directed by evolutionarily conserved developmental pathways 1,2. Within species, canalized developmental programs typically produce only modest morphological variation. However, as a result of millennia of artificial selection, the domestic pigeon (Columba livia) displays radical variation in craniofacial morphology within a single species. One of the most striking cases of pigeon craniofacial variation is the short beak phenotype, which has been selected in numerous breeds. Classical genetic experiments suggest that pigeon beak length is regulated by a small number of genetic factors, one of which is sex-linked (Ku2 locus) 3-5. However, the molecular genetic underpinnings of pigeon craniofacial variation remain unknown. To determine the genetic basis of the short beak phenotype, we used geometric morphometrics and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping on an F2 intercross between a short-beaked Old German Owl (OGO) and a medium-beaked Racing Homer (RH). We identified a single locus on the Z-chromosome that explains a majority of the variation in beak morphology in the RH x OGO F2 population. In complementary comparative genomic analyses, we found that the same locus is also strongly differentiated between breeds with short and medium beaks. Within the differentiated Ku2 locus, we identified an amino acid substitution in the non-canonical Wnt receptor ROR2 as a putative regulator of pigeon beak length. The non-canonical Wnt (planar cell polarity) pathway serves critical roles in vertebrate neural crest cell migration and craniofacial morphogenesis 6,7. In humans, homozygous ROR2 mutations cause autosomal recessive Robinow syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities, including a widened and shortened facial skeleton 8,9. Our results illustrate how the extraordinary craniofacial variation among pigeons can reveal genetic regulators of vertebrate craniofacial diversity.",

    "abstract": "Deciphering the genetic basis of vertebrate craniofacial variation is a longstanding biological problem with broad implications in evolution, development, and human pathology. One of the most stunning examples of craniofacial diversification is the adaptive radiation of birds, in which the beak serves essential roles in virtually every aspect of their life histories. The domestic pigeon (Columba livia) provides an exceptional opportunity to study the genetic underpinnings of craniofacial variation because of its unique balance of experimental accessibility and extraordinary phenotypic diversity within a single species. We used traditional and geometric morphometrics to quantify craniofacial variation in an F2 laboratory cross derived from the straight-beaked Pomeranian Pouter and curved-beak Scandaroon pigeon breeds. Using a combination of genome-wide quantitative trait locus scans and multi-locus modeling, we identified a set of genetic loci associated with complex shape variation in the craniofacial skeleton, including beak curvature, braincase shape, and mandible shape. Some of these loci control coordinated changes between different structures, while others explain variation in the size and shape of specific skull and jaw regions. We find that in domestic pigeons, a complex blend of both independent and coupled genetic effects underlie three-dimensional craniofacial morphology.",

    "abstract": "African Trypanosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma brucei (T. brucei) and is spread by the tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is fatal if left untreated and the currently approved drugs for treatment are toxic and difficult to administer. The trypanosome must survive in the insect vector and its mammalian host, and to adapt to these different conditions, the parasite relies on molecular chaperones called heat shock proteins. Heat shock proteins mediate the folding of newly synthesized proteins as well as prevent misfolding of proteins under normal conditions and during stressful conditions. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is one of the major molecular chaperones of the stress response at the cellular level. It functions with other chaperones and co-chaperones and inhibition of its interactions is being explored as a potential therapeutic target for numerous diseases. This study provides an in-silico overview of Hsp90 and its co-chaperones in both T. brucei brucei and T. brucei gambiense in relation to human and other kinetoplastid parasites. The evolutionary, functional, and structural analyses of Hsp90 were also shown. The updated information on Hsp90 and its co-chaperones from recently published proteomics on T. brucei was examined for the different life cycle stages and subcellular localisations. The results show a difference between T. b. brucei and T. b. gambiense with T. b. brucei encoding 12 putative Hsp90 genes, 10 of which are cytosolic and located on a single chromosome while T. gambiense encodes 5 Hsp90 genes, 3 of which are located in the cytosol. Eight putative co-chaperones were identified in this study, 6 TPR-containing and 2 non-TPR-containing co-chaperones. This study provides an updated context for studying the biology of the African trypanosome and evaluating Hsp90 and its interactions as potential drug targets.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial ribosomes (mitoribosomes) synthezise a critical set of proteins essential for oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, their function is vital to cellular energy supply and mitoribosomal defects give rise to a large and diverse group of human diseases 1. The architecture of mitoribosomes is strikingly different from that of their bacterial and eukaryotic cytosolic counterparts and display high divergence between species 2-6. Mitoribosome biogenesis follows distinct molecular pathways that remain poorly understood. Here, we determined the cryo-EM structures of mitoribosomes isolated from human cell lines with either depleted or overexpressed mitoribosome assembly factor GTPBP5. This allowed us to capture consecutive steps during mitoribosomal large subunit (mt-LSU) biogenesis that involve normally short-lived assembly intermediates. Our structures provide important insights into the last steps of 16S rRNA folding, methylation and peptidyl transferase centre (PTC) completion, which require the coordinated action of nine assembly factors. We show that mammalian-specific MTERF4 contributes to the folding of 16S rRNA, allowing 16S rRNA methylation by MRM2, while GTPBP5 and NSUN4 promote fine-tuning rRNA rearrangments leading to PTC formation. Moreover, our data reveal an unexpected role for the elongation factor mtEF-Tu in mt-LSU assembly, in which mt-EF-Tu interacts with GTPBP5 in a manner similar to its interaction with tRNA during translational elongation. Together, our approaches provide detailed understanding of the last stages of mt-LSU biogenesis that are unique to mammalian mitochondria.",

    "abstract": "-ketoglutarate (KG) is a central metabolic node with a broad influence on cellular physiology. The KG analogue N-oxalylglycine (NOG) and its membrane-permeable pro-drug derivative dimethyl-oxalylglycine (DMOG) have been extensively used as tools to study prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) and other KG-dependent processes. In cell culture media, DMOG is rapidly converted to MOG, which enters cells through monocarboxylate transporter MCT2, leading to intracellular NOG concentrations that are sufficiently high to inhibit glutaminolysis enzymes and cause cytotoxicity. Therefore, the degree of (D)MOG instability together with MCT2 expression levels determine the intracellular targets NOG engages with and, ultimately, its effects on cell viability. Here we designed and characterised a series of MOG analogues with the aims of improving stability and exploring the functional requirements for interaction with MCT2, a relatively understudied member of the SLC16 family. We report MOG analogues that maintain ability to enter cells via MCT2, and identify compounds that do not inhibit glutaminolysis or cause cytotoxicity but can still inhibit PHDs. We use these analogues to show that glutaminolysis-induced activation of mTORC1 can be uncoupled from PHD activity. Therefore, these new compounds can help deconvolute cellular effects that result from the polypharmacological action of NOG.",

    "abstract": "Heterodimeric capping protein (CP/CapZ) is an essential factor for the assembly of branched actin networks, which push against cellular membranes to drive a large variety of cellular processes. Aside from terminating filament growth, CP stimulates the nucleation of actin filaments by the Arp2/3 complex in branched actin networks through an unclear mechanism. Here, we report the structure of capped actin filament barbed ends, which reveals how CP not only prevents filament elongation, but also controls access to both terminal filament subunits. In addition to its primary binding site that blocks the penultimate subunit, we find that the CP sterically occludes the central interaction site of the terminal actin protomer through one of its C-terminal \"tentacle\" extensions. Deletion of this {beta} tentacle only modestly impairs capping. However in the context of a growing branched actin network, its removal potently inhibits nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) by tethering them to capped filament ends. End tethering of NPFs prevents their loading with actin monomers required for activation of the Arp2/3 complex and thus strongly inhibits branched network assembly both in cells and reconstituted motility assays. Our results mechanistically explain how CP couples two opposed processes -capping and nucleation- in branched actin network assembly.",

Understanding how RNA sequence directs the formation of biologically active structures requires approaches that can comprehensively assess how changes in an RNA sequence affect its structure and function. Towards this goal, I have developed a general method for purifying E. coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) transcription elongation complexes (TECs) for use in systematic RNA assays. My approach depends on two constituent technologies: First, I have designed an E. coli {sigma} 70 promoter that can be efficiently barcoded using a one-pot series of enzymatic reactions. Second, I have developed a strategy for purifying promoter-initiated E. coli RNAP TECs by selective photo-elution from streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Together, these methods establish a platform for the development of TEC Display assays in which the functional properties of RNA sequence variants can be recorded by fractionating and quantitatively barcoding a TEC library.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExcessive oxidative stress and related chronic, sub-clinical inflammation is linked causally to the development and progression of degenerative diseases of the retina including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma, leading causes of blindness worldwide. The above responses may be related directly to dysregulated retinal immunity and are potentiated by the combined actions of native retinal cells (e.g., retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and microglial cells) and immune cells infiltrating from the periphery. Maintaining tight regulation of these cells such that effective control of pathogens is accomplished yet uncontrolled inflammation and consequent tissue damage is prevented is extremely important. However, the molecular mechanisms that control this delicate balance are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2/GPR109A) may play an important role. HCAR2/GPR109A has been shown to regulate immune cell responses that potentiate anti-inflammatory signaling upon its activation in various tissues as evidenced principally by suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in various experimental model systems. We have demonstrated HCAR2/GPR109A expression in RPE, microglia and endothelial cells and, our in vitro studies support that the receptor elicits anti-inflammatory signaling in these cell types. However, the functional relevance of HCAR2/GPR109A expression and its activation in the retina of the living animal has not been demonstrated definitively. This is the purpose of the present study.\n\nMethodsRetinal function was evaluated temporally in wildtype (Hcar2/Gpr109a +/+, WT) and knockout (Hcar2/Gpr109 -/-, KO) mice via electroretinography (ERG). Fundoscopic imaging, spectral domain-optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography and post-mortem histological analyses were additionally performed to evaluate retinal health. Gene microarray, RT-qPCR studies, ingenuity analyses and proteome pathway mapping were performed to evaluate potential key differences in the molecular signatures of WT and KO mouse retinas. Leukostasis and flow cytometric assays were performed to demonstrate the in vivo impact of HCAR2/GPR109A expression and its therapeutic activation on pro-inflammatory immune cell trafficking in retina.\n\nResultsLongitudinal studies revealed progressive anomalies in retinal morphology and function in HCAR2/GPR109A knockout mice that impacted the entire retina. Gene expression and protein interactome analyses revealed differences in gene and protein expression consistent with the increased immune reactivity and infiltration of bone-marrow derived immune cells detected in KO mouse retinas. Studies conducted in an acute model of retinal (endotoxin-induced) inflammation revealed that targeting the receptor via intraperitoneal administration of agonist, beta-hydroxybutyrate, limits immune cell activation, infiltration and related inflammation in WT retinas.\n\nConclusionsThe present studies demonstrate a central role for HCAR2/GPR109A in regulating the complex interplay between resident retinal cells and peripheral immune cells and, the potential therapeutic utility that targeting the receptor holds with respect to preventing and treating inflammatory retinal diseases.\n\nHighlightsOxidative stress and inflammation are major causative factors in degenerative retinal diseases stemming from numerous causes (e.g., aging, diabetes, sickle cell). Thus, identifying new targets and developing strategies to counter these factors to prevent and treat retinal degeneration is important. The present in vivo study demonstrates convincingly the principal role of the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCAR2/GPR109A) as a major regulator of retinal immune responses under normal conditions and therefore, as a target with extremely high potential for therapeutic modulation of these responses in retinal disease.",

    "abstract": "The PcrA/UvrD helicase binds directly to RNA polymerase (RNAP) but the structural basis for this interaction and its functional significance have remained unclear. In this work we used biochemical assays and hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry to study the PcrA-RNAP complex. We find that PcrA binds tightly to a transcription elongation complex in a manner dependent on protein:protein interaction with the conserved PcrA C-terminal Tudor domain. The helicase binds predominantly to two positions on the surface of RNAP. The PcrA C-terminal domain engages a conserved region in a lineage-specific insert within the {beta} subunit which we identify as a helicase interaction motif present in many other PcrA partner proteins, including the nucleotide excision repair factor UvrB. The catalytic core of the helicase binds near the RNA and DNA exit channels and blocking PcrA activity in vivo leads to the accumulation of R-loops. We propose a role for PcrA as an R-loop suppression factor that helps to minimise conflicts between transcription and other processes on DNA including replication.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is responsible for one of the most deleterious pandemics of our time. The interaction between the ACE2 receptors at the surface of human cells and the viral Spike (S) protein triggers the infection making the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S-protein a focal target for the neutralizing antibodies (Abs). Despite the recent progress in the development and deployment of vaccines, the emergence of novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 insensitive to Abs produced in response to the vaccine administration and/or monoclonal ones represents upcoming jeopardy. Here, we assessed the possible effects of single and multiple mutations in the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 S-protein on its binding energy to various antibodies and the human ACE2 receptor. The performed computational analysis indicates that while single amino acid replacements in RBD may only cause partial impairment of the Abs binding, moreover, limited to specific epitopes, some variants of SARS-CoV-2 (with as few as 8 mutations), which are already present in the population, may potentially result in a much broader antigenic escape. We also identified a number of point mutations, which, in contrast to the majority of replacements, reduce RBD affinity to various antibodies without affecting its binding to ACE2. Overall, the results provide guidelines for further experimental studies aiming at the identification of the high-risk RBD mutations allowing for an antigenic escape.",

    "abstract": "Cells are exposed to a plethora of influences that can cause damage to DNA and alter the genome, often with detrimental consequences for health. Cells mitigate this damage through a variety of repair protein pathways, and accurate measurement of the accumulation, action, and dissipation timescales of these repair proteins is required to fully understand the DNA damage response. Recently, we described the Q-FADD (Quantitation of Fluorescence Accumulation after DNA Damage) method, which enhances the analytical power of the widely used laser microirradiation technique. In that study, Q-FADD and its preprocessing operations required licensed software and a significant amount of user overhead to find the model of best fit. Here, we present \"qFADD.py\", an open-source implementation of the Q-FADD algorithm that is available as both a stand-alone software package and on a publicly accessible webserver (https://qfadd.colorado.edu/). Furthermore, we describe significant improvements to the fitting and preprocessing methods that include corrections for nuclear drift and an automated grid-search for the model of best fit. To improve statistical rigor, the grid-search algorithm also includes automated simulation of replicates. As an example, we discuss the recruitment dynamics of the signaling protein PARP1 to DNA damage sites, and we show how to compare different populations of qFADD.py models.\n\nStatement of SignificanceCells are constantly bombarded by factors that can alter or damage their genome, and they have evolved a variety of proteins that can identify and fix this damage. To fully understand how these proteins interact in repair pathways, we need robust methods to quantify the timescales between the initial identification of the DNA damage event and the subsequent protein-protein interactions that lead to repair. Laser microirradiation is a popular method for studying these repair protein cascades in vivo, and methods for quantifying the timescales of recruitment in these experiments have historically been simple to implement but lacking in physical interpretation. Here, we present qFADD.py, the next iteration of the Q-FADD method, which uses Monte Carlo diffusion models to interpret repair protein recruitment timescales to sites of DNA damage. By moving towards automated fitting procedures with minimal bias from the user, qFADD.py provides a statistically robust but low-effort means to analyze laser microirradiation experiments through a biophysical framework.",

    "abstract": "Locomotion at the microscale is remarkably sophisticated. Microorganisms have evolved diverse strategies to move within highly viscous environments, using deformable, propulsion-generating appendages such as cilia and flagella to drive helical or undulatory motion. In single-celled algae, these appendages can be arranged in different ways around an approximately 10 {micro}m cell body, and coordinated in distinct temporal patterns. Inspired by the observation that some quadriflagellates (bearing four flagella) have an outwardly similar morphology and flagellar beat pattern, yet swim at different speeds, this study seeks to determine whether variations in swimming performance could arise solely from differences in swimming gait. Robotics approaches are particularly suited to such investigations, where the phase relationships between appendages can be readily manipulated. Here, we developed autonomous, algae-inspired robophysical models that can self-propel in a viscous fluid. These macroscopic robots (length and width = 8.5 cm, height = 2 cm) have four independently actuated  flagella that oscillate back and forth under low-Reynolds number conditions (Re[~] [O] (10-1)). We tested the swimming performance of these robot models with appendages arranged in one of two distinct configurations, and coordinated in one of three distinct gaits. The gaits, namely the pronk, the trot, and the gallop, correspond to gaits adopted by distinct microalgal species. When the appendages are inserted perpendicularly around a central  body, the robot achieved a net performance of 0.15 - 0.63 body lengths per cycle, with the trot gait being the fastest. Robotic swimming performance was found to be comparable to that of the algal microswimmers across all gaits. By creating a minimal robot that can successfully reproduce cilia-inspired drag-based swimming, our work paves the way for the design of next-generation devices that have the capacity to autonomously navigate aqueous environments.",

Recently, colorectal cancer specific microbiome signatures have been proposed as an additional marker for CRC detection. A desirable aim would be the possibility to analyze microbiome from the fecal samples collected during CRC screening programs into FIT tubes for fecal occult blood testing.\n\nMethodsWe investigated the impact of the Fecal Immunohistochemical Test (FIT) and stabilization buffer on the microbial community structure in stool samples from 30 volunteers and compared their communities to fresh-frozen samples highlighting also the previously published cancer-specific communities. Altogether 214 samples were analyzed including positive and negative controls using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\n\nResultsThe variation between individuals is greater than the differences introduced by collection strategy. The vast majority of the genera are stable for up to 7 days. None of the changes observed between fresh frozen samples and FIT tubes are related to previously shown colorectal-cancer specific bacteria.\n\nConclusionsOverall, our results show that FIT tubes can be used for profiling the gut microbiota in colorectal cancer screening programs as the community is similar to fresh frozen samples and stable at least for 7 days.\n\nImpactSample material from FIT tubes could be used in addition to fecal immunochemical tests for future investigations into the role of gut microbiota in colorectal cancer screening programs circumventing the need to collect additional samples and possibly improving the sensitivity of FIT.",

G13 is pro-tumorigenic in epithelial cancer cell lines, which contrasts with its tumor-suppressive function in transgenic mouse models of lymphomas. Here we show that while loss of G13 in pancreatic cell lines decreases tumor growth in vivo, G13 loss in the Kras-driven (KC) mouse model of pancreatic tumor initiation does not affect tumor development or survival. Instead, G13 loss in the Kras/Tp53 (KPC) transgenic mouse model of advanced pancreatic cancer promotes well-differentiated tumors with increased tumor burden and reduced survival. Mechanistically, G13 loss in the KPC mouse model enhances E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell junctions and mTOR signaling. Importantly, human pancreatic cancers with low G13 expression exhibit increased E-cadherin protein expression and mTOR signaling. This work establishes a context-dependent role of G13 in pancreatic tumorigenesis, demonstrating a tumor-suppressive role in transgenic mouse models of advanced pancreatic cancer.",

Sudden and widespread outbreaks of severe  white-patch disease have occurred since 2011 in batfish farms one to three weeks after the transfer of juveniles from bio-secured hatcheries to lagoon cages. With cumulative mortality ranging from 20 to 90%, the sustainability of aquaculture of this species is severely threatened.\n\nIn this study, we describe for the first time the isolation from diseased batfish of several strains belonging to the species Tenacibaculum maritimum, a major pathogen of many marine fish species. Histopathological analysis, an experimental bath challenge and a field monitoring study showed that T. maritimum is associated with white-patch disease. Moreover, molecular and serological analyses performed on representative strains revealed some degree of genetic diversity among the isolates, a finding of primary importance for epidemiological studies and for the development of management and control strategies such as vaccination.",

    "abstract": "Although functional connectivity and associated graph theory measures (e.g., centrality; how centrally important to the network a region is) are widely used in brain research, the full extent to which these functional measures are related to the underlying structural connectivity is not yet fully understood. Graph neural network deep learning methods have not yet been applied for this purpose, and offer an ideal model architecture for working with connectivity data given their ability to capture and maintain inherent network structure. This model applied here to predict functional connectivity and centrality from structural connectivity accounted for 89% of the variance in mean functional connectivity, 56% of the variance in individual-level functional connectivity, 99% of the variance in mean functional centrality, and 81% of the variance in individual-level functional centrality. This model provides a new benchmark for performance and represents a novel finding that functional centrality can be robustly predicted from structural connectivity. Regions of particular importance to the models performance as determined through lesioning are discussed, whereby regions with higher centrality have a higher impact on model performance. Future research on models of patient, demographic, or behavioural data can also benefit from this graph neural network method as it is ideally-suited for capturing connectivity and centrality in brain networks. These results have set a new benchmark for prediction of functional connectivity from structural connectivity, and models like this may ultimately lead to a way to predict functional connectivity in individuals who are unable to do fMRI tasks (e.g., non-responsive patients).",

    "abstract": "Large-scale biophysical circuit models can provide mechanistic insights into the fundamental micro-scale and macro-scale properties of brain organization that shape complex patterns of spontaneous brain activity. By allowing local synaptic properties to vary across brain regions, recent large-scale circuit models have demonstrated better fit to empirical observations, such as inter-regional synchrony averaged over several minutes, i.e. static functional connectivity (FC). However, most previous models do not capture how inter-regional synchrony patterns vary over timescales of seconds, i.e., time-varying FC dynamics. Here we developed a spatially-heterogeneous large-scale dynamical circuit model that allowed for variation in local circuit properties across the human cortex. We showed that parameterizing local circuit properties with both anatomical and functional gradients was necessary for generating realistic static and dynamical properties of resting-state fMRI activity. Furthermore, empirical and simulated FC dynamics demonstrated remarkably similar sharp transitions in FC patterns, suggesting the existence of multiple attractors. We found that time-varying regional fMRI amplitude tracked multi-stability in FC dynamics. Causal manipulation of the large-scale circuit model suggested that sensory-motor regions were a driver of FC dynamics. Finally, the spatial distribution of sensory-motor drivers matched the principal gradient of gene expression that encompassed certain interneuron classes, suggesting that heterogeneity in excitation-inhibition balance might shape multi-stability in FC dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian frontal and auditory cortices are important for vocal behaviour. Here, using local field potential recordings, we demonstrate for the first time that the timing and spatial pattern of oscillations in the fronto-auditory cortical network of vocalizing bats (Carollia perspicillata) predict the purpose of vocalization: echolocation or communication. Transfer entropy analyses revealed predominantly top-down (frontal-to-auditory cortex) information flow during spontaneous activity and pre-vocal periods. The dynamics of information flow depended on the behavioural role of the vocalization and on the timing relative to vocal onset. Remarkably, we observed the emergence of predominantly bottom-up (auditory-to-frontal cortex) information transfer patterns specific echolocation production, leading to self-directed acoustic feedback. Electrical stimulation of frontal areas selectively enhanced responses to echolocation sounds in auditory cortex. These results reveal unique changes in information flow across sensory and frontal cortices, potentially driven by the purpose of the vocalization in a highly vocal mammalian model.",

    "abstract": "Brucella species are intracellular bacterial pathogens, causing the world-wide zoonotic disease, brucellosis. Brucella invade professional and non-professional phagocytic cells, followed by resisting intracellular killing and establishing a replication permissive niche. Brucella also modulate the innate and adaptive immune responses of the host for their chronic persistence. The complex intracellular cycle of Brucella majorly depends on multiple host factors but limited information is available on host and bacterial proteins that play essential role in the invasion, intracellular replication and modulation of host immune responses. By employing an siRNA screening, we identified a role for the host protein, FBXO22 in Brucella-macrophage interaction. FBXO22 is the key element in the SCF E3 ubiquitination complex where it determines the substrate specificity for ubiquitination and degradation of various host proteins. Downregulation of FBXO22 by siRNA or CRISPR-Cas9 system, resulted diminished uptake of Brucella into macrophages, which was dependent on NF-{kappa}B-mediated regulation of phagocytic receptors. FBXO22 expression was upregulated in Brucella-infected macrophages that resulted induction of phagocytic receptors and enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines through NF-{kappa}B. Furthermore, we found that FBXO22 recruits the effector proteins of Brucella, including the anti-inflammatory proteins, TcpB and OMP25 for degradation through the SCF complex. We did not observe any role for another F-box containing protein of SCF complex, {beta}-TrCP in Brucella-macrophage interaction. Our findings unravel novel functions of FBXO22 in host-pathogen interaction and its contribution to pathogenesis of infectious diseases.\n\nAuthor SummaryBrucellosis is a major zoonotic disease world-wide that poses a serious veterinary and public health problem in various countries, impacting their economic development. Brucellosis is caused by the species of intracellular bacterial pathogen, Brucella that replicates in professional and non-professional phagocytic cells. Brucella is considered as a stealthy pathogen as it invades/suppresses host defense responses using various virulence strategies. Brucella hijacks many cellular processes for gaining entry into the target cells, followed by establishing a replication permissive niche. However, host proteins that are involved in Brucella-macrophage interaction remains obscure. Here, we identified the host protein, FBXO22 that recruits target proteins to SCF E3 ubiquitination complex for their ubiquitination and degradation. We found that down-regulation and upregulation of FBXO22 decreased and enhanced the uptake of Brucella by macrophages, respectively. Our subsequent studies revealed that Brucella induces the expression of FBXO22 that resulted activation of NF-{kappa}B and the concomitant upregulation of phagocytic receptors that might have contributed to the enhanced uptake of Brucella. The Brucella-induced expression of FBXO22 resulted enhanced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. We have also found that FBXO22 targets Brucella effectors, including the anti-inflammatory effector proteins for degradation through the SCF complex. Our experimental data reveals that FBXO22 plays an important role in the uptake of microbial pathogens by macrophages and pathogenesis of infectious diseases that is resulting from overt inflammatory responses.",

Its major virulence attributes (biofilm formation, production of proteases and hemolytic toxins) enable it to cause extensive host tissue damage. With the alarming increase in enterococcal resistance to antibiotics, novel therapeutics are required to inhibit E. faecalis biofilm formation and virulence. Trans-cinnamaldehyde (TC), the main phytochemical in cinnamon essential oils has demonstrated promising activity against a wide range of pathogens. Here, we comprehensively investigated the effect of TC on planktonic growth, biofilm formation, proteolytic and hemolytic activities, as well as gene regulation in E. faecalis. Our findings revealed that sub-inhibitory concentrations of TC reduced biofilm formation, biofilm exopolysaccharides as well as its proteolytic and hemolytic activities. Mechanistic studies revealed significant down regulation of the quorum sensing fsr locus and downstream gelE, which are major virulence regulators in E. faecalis. Taken together, our study highlights the potential of TC to inhibit E. faecalis biofilm formation and its virulence.",

    "abstract": "Oral diseases are one of the most common pathologies affecting human health. These diseases are typically associated with dental plaque-biofilms, through either build-up of the biofilm or dysbiosis of the microbial community. Arginine can disrupt dental plaque-biofilms, and maintain plaque homeostasis, making it an ideal therapeutic to combat the development of oral disease. Despite our understanding of the actions of arginine towards dental plaque-biofilms, it is still unclear how or if arginine effects the mechanical integrity of the dental plaque-biofilm. Here we adapted a rotating-disc rheometry assay, which is routinely used in marine microbial ecology, to study how arginine treatment of Streptococcus gordonii biofilms influences biofilm detachment from surfaces. We demonstrate that the assay is highly sensitive at quantifying the presence of biofilm and the detachment or rearrangement of the biofilm structure as a function of shear stress. We demonstrate that arginine treatment leads to earlier detachment of the biofilm, indicating that arginine treatment weakens the biofilm, making it more suspectable to removal by shear stresses. Our results add to the understanding that arginine targets biofilms by multifaceted mechanisms, both metabolic and physical, further promoting the potential of arginine as an active compound in dentifrices to maintain oral health.",

All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K, K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2 binding site mutations, we explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.",

    "abstract": "Over the last 20 years increased funding for malaria research has resulted in very significant technical advances to study the biology of Plasmodium species. High throughput phenotypic assays have been developed to screen millions of compounds and identify small molecules with antiparasitic activity. At the same time, advances in malaria genetic have greatly facilitated the generation of genetically modified parasites, and whole genome genetic screens are now feasible in Plasmodium species. Finally, there has been an increased interest to study malaria parasites at the population level, in particular in the area of drug resistance. Drug resistant field isolates have been collected around the world, and drug resistant strains are routinely generated in the lab to study the mechanisms of drug resistance. As a result, one of the current bottlenecks in malaria research is our ability to quickly characterize the phenotype associated with compound treatment or genetic modification, or to quickly compare differences in intracellular development between strains. Here, we present a high content/high throughput phenotypic assay that combines highly selective RNA, DNA, and RBC membrane dyes to provide hourly resolution of the full erythrocytic cycle for both P. falciparum and P. knowlesi. A flow cytometry assay allows the analysis of samples in a 384-well format and a quick way to determine the parasite developmental stage. On the other hand, the fluorescence microscopy format allows for a detailed visualization of parasite morphology. Finally, using open source software we have developed protocols for the automated cluster analysis of microscopy images. This assay can be applied to any Plasmodium species, requires very little amount of sample, is performed with fixed cells, and is easily scalable. Overall, we believe this assay will be a great tool for the malaria community to study Plasmodium species.",

    "abstract": "Marine benthic environments may be shaped by anthropogenic and other localized events, leading to changes in microbial community composition evident decades after a disturbance. Marine sediments in particular harbor exceptional taxonomic diversity and can shed light on distinctive evolutionary strategies. Genetic code expansion may increase the structural and functional diversity of proteins in cells, by repurposing stop codons to encode noncanonical amino acids: pyrrolysine (Pyl) and selenocysteine (Sec). Here, we show that the genomes of abundant Deltaproteobacteria from the sediments of a deep-ocean chemical waste dump site, have undergone genetic code expansion. Pyl and Sec in these organisms appear to augment trimethylamine (TMA) and one-carbon metabolism, representing key drivers of their ecology. The inferred metabolism of these sulfate-reducing bacteria places them in competition with methylotrophic methanogens for TMA, a contention further supported by earlier isotope tracer studies and reanalysis of metatranscriptomic studies. A survey of genomic data further reveals a broad geographic distribution of a niche group of similarly specialized Deltaproteobacteria including at sulfidic sites in the Atlantic Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Guayamas Basin, and North Sea, as well as in terrestrial and estuarine environments. These findings reveal an important biogeochemical role for specialized Deltaproteobacteria at the interface of the carbon, nitrogen and sulfur cycles, with their niche adaptation and ecological success seemingly enabled by genetic code expansion.",

The latent parasite infection of the immune-privileged central nervous system is linked to most complications. With no drug currently available to eliminate the latent cysts in the brain of infected hosts, the consequences of neurons long-term infection are unknown. It has long been known that T. gondii specifically differentiates into a latent form (bradyzoite) in neurons, but how the infected neuron responds to the infection remains to be elucidated. We have established a new in vitro model resulting in the production of mature bradyzoite cysts in brain cells. Using dual, host and parasite RNA-seq, we characterized the dynamics of differentiation of the parasite, revealing the involvement of key pathways in this process. Moreover, we identified how the infected brain cells responded to the parasite infection revealing the drastic changes that take place. We showed that neuronal-specific pathways are strongly affected, with synapse signaling being particularly affected, especially glutamatergic synapse signaling. The establishment of this new in vitro model allows investigating both the dynamics of parasite differentiation and the specific response of neurons to the long-term infection by this parasite.",

    "abstract": "Germicidal potential of specific wavelengths within the electromagnetic spectrum is an area of growing interest. While ultra-violet (UV) based technologies have shown satisfactory virucidal potential, the photo-toxicity in humans coupled with UV associated polymer degradation limit its use in occupied spaces. Alternatively, longer wavelengths with less irradiation energy such as visible light (405 nm) have largely been explored in the context of bactericidal and fungicidal applications. Such studies indicated that 405 nm mediated inactivation is caused by the absorbance of porphyrins within the organism creating reactive oxygen species which result in free radical damage to its DNA and disruption of cellular functions. The virucidal potential of visible-light based technologies has been largely unexplored and speculated to be ineffective given the lack of porphyrins in viruses. The current study demonstrated increased susceptibility of lipid-enveloped respiratory pathogens of importance such as SARS-CoV-2 (causative agent of COVID-19) as well as the influenza A virus to 405nm, visible light in the absence of exogenous photosensitizers indicating a potential porphyrin-independent alternative mechanism of visible light mediated viral inactivation. These results were obtained using less than expected irradiance levels which are generally safe for humans and commercially achievable. Our results support further exploration of the use of visible light technology for the application of continuous decontamination in occupied areas within hospitals and/or infectious disease laboratories, specifically for the inactivation of respiratory pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A.",

While Plasmodium spp. genomes encode a full complement of chaperones4, they lack an ortholog of the conserved transcription factor HSF1, which in most eukaryotes activates the expression of key chaperones upon heat shock (HS)5-8. Here we identified PfAP2-HS, a transcription factor of the ApiAP2 family9-11, as the key regulator of the P. falciparum protective HS response. The PfAP2-HS-dependent HS response is largely restricted to rapid activation of hsp70-1, the predominant direct target of PfAP2-HS, and hsp90. Deletion of PfAP2-HS dramatically reduced HS survival and also resulted in severe growth defects at 37{degrees}C, but not at 35{degrees}C, and increased sensitivity to imbalances in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) produced by artemisinin, the current frontline antimalarial drug12,13. These results demonstrate that PfAP2-HS contributes to general maintenance of proteostasis and drives a rapid chaperone-based protective response against febrile temperatures. While several ApiAP2 transcription factors regulate life cycle transitions in malaria parasites11,14,15, PfAP2-HS is the first identified Plasmodium transcription factor that controls a protective response to a within-host environmental challenge.",

    "abstract": "Significance StatementGenetic exchange among bacteria shapes the microbial world. From the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance genes to fundamental questions about the nature of bacterial species, this powerful evolutionary force has preoccupied scientists for decades. However, the mixing of genes between species rests on a paradox. On one hand, promoting adaptation by conferring novel functionality, on the other potentially introducing disharmonious gene combinations (negative epistasis) that will be selected against. Taking an interdisciplinary approach to analyse natural populations of the enteric bacteria Campylobacter, an ideal example of long-range admixture, we demonstrate that genes can independently transfer across species boundaries and rejoin in epistasis in a recipient genome. This challenges conventional ideas and highlights the possibility of single step evolution by saltation.\n\nAbstractRecombination of short DNA fragments via horizontal gene transfer (HGT) can both introduce beneficial alleles and create genomic disharmony through negative epistasis. For non-core (accessory) genes, the negative epistatic cost is likely to be minimal because the incoming genes have not co-evolved with the recipient genome. By contrast, for the core genome, interspecific recombination is expected to be rare because disruptive allelic replacement is likely to introduce negative epistasis. Why then is homologous recombination common in the core of bacterial genomes? To understand this enigma we take advantage of an exceptional model system, the common enteric pathogens Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli, that are known for very high magnitude interspecies gene flow in the core genome. As expected, HGT does indeed disrupt co-adapted allele pairings (negative epistasis). However, multiple HGT events enable recovery of the genomes co-adaption between introgressing alleles, even in core metabolism genes (e.g., formate dehydrogenase). These findings demonstrate that, even for complex traits, genetic coalitions can be decoupled, transferred and independently reinstated in a new genetic background - facilitating transition between fitness peaks. In this example, the two-step recombinational process is associated with C. coli that are adapted to the agricultural niche.",

Here, we performed an unbiased bioinformatic search to mine bacterial genomes for prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgos) harboring a PIWI domain. Our search identified 3,033 pAgos in total, of which 1,464 portend to the subgroup of long pAgos with more than 600 amino acids. We purified a subset of 49 pAgos which were found in proximity to helicases and tested their nuclease activity in vitro. Ten of these were active towards single-stranded DNA substrates and this activity could be programmed by exogenous guide DNAs or RNAs. Cleavage of double-stranded plasmid DNA was much less readily observed and was fostered by elevated temperatures or exogenous addition of a DNA single-strand binding protein (ET-SSB). The efficiency of pAgo-mediated plasmid cleavage was dependent on the DNA target sequence as well as the surrounding sequence, suggesting that unwinding of the DNA double helix was a limiting factor. Intriguingly, we identified a cluster of pAgos from the Clostridial clade which was active at 37{degrees}C and activity was enhanced by exogenous ET-SSB. This suggests that Clostridial pAgos may be particularly suited to catalyze DNA double-strand cleavage and implies that such pAgos may be repurposed as gene editing tools in future.",

Rooting success was evaluated across four propagation medias, five rooting hormones, and eight commercially available high-cannabidiol (CBD) essential oil hemp cultivars. Cuttings were placed in a climate-controlled room and assessed for rooting success 12 days after cloning. Rooting success was determined by quantifying total root number, cumulative total root length, and total root mass. Propagation media had the greatest effect on rooting success (13-80 %). Rockwool had the highest rooting success resulting in 10-fold increases in rooting traits over the next highest scoring medium (Berger BM6). Hormone applications significantly improved (15-to 18-fold) rooting success compared to no hormone application, while non-statistical differences were observed across auxin hormone concentrations and application methods. Genetic variation in rooting response was observed between cultivars with  Cherry Wine outperforming all other cultivars with an approximate 20% increase in rooting success over the next highest rooting cultivar,  Wife.

    "abstract": "Agrochemicals are commonly used in agriculture to protect crops and ensure yields. Several of them are mobile within the plant and, being perceived as xenobiotics regardless of their protective/curative roles, they induce a reprogramming of secondary metabolism linked to the detoxification processes even in the absence of phenotype symptoms. Moreover, it is well documented that plants, thanks to the root exudation of different metabolites, are able to shape the microbial population at the rhizosphere and to significantly affect the processes occurring therein. Here we show that plant metabolic response to foliarly-applied pesticides is much broader than what previously thought and includes diverse and compound-specific hidden processes. Among others, stress-related metabolism and phytohormones profile underwent a considerable reorganization. Moreover, a distinctive microbial rearrangement of the rhizosphere was recorded following foliar application of pesticides. Such effects have unavoidably energetic and metabolic costs for the plant paving the way to both positive and negative aspects. The understanding of these effects is crucial for an increasingly sustainable use of pesticides in agriculture.\n\nHighlightThe foliar application of pesticides induces a broad metabolic reprogramming in plant and shapes the microbial population of the rhizosphere.",

    "abstract": "Highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 caused outbreaks in poultry at an unprecedented global scale. The virus was spread by wild birds in Asia in two waves: clade-2.3.4.4A in 2014/2015 and clade-2.3.4.4B since 2016 up to today. Both clades were highly virulent in chickens, but only clade-B viruses exhibited high virulence in ducks. Viral factors which contribute to virulence and transmission of these panzootic H5N8 2.3.4.4 viruses are largely unknown. The NS1 protein, typically composed of 230 amino acids (aa), is a multifunctional protein which is also a pathogenicity factor. Here, we studied the evolutionary trajectory of H5N8 NS1 proteins from 2013 to 2019 and their role in the fitness of H5N8 viruses in chickens and ducks. Sequence analysis and in-vitro experiments indicated that clade-2.3.4.4A and clade-2.3.4.4B viruses have a preference for NS1 of 237-aa and 217-aa, respectively over NS1 of 230-aa. NS217 was exclusively seen in domestic and wild birds in Europe. The extension of the NS1 C-terminus of clade-B virus reduced virus transmission and replication in chickens and ducks and partially impaired the systemic tropism to the endothelium in ducks. Conversely, lower impact on fitness of clade-A virus was observed. Remarkably, the NS1 of clade-A and clade-B, regardless of length, was efficient to block interferon induction in infected chickens and changes in the NS1 C-terminus reduced the efficiency for interferon antagonism. Together, the NS1 C-terminus contributes to the efficient transmission and high fitness of H5N8 viruses in chickens and ducks.\n\nImportanceThe panzootic H5N8 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses of clade 2.3.4.4A and 2.3.4.4B devastated poultry industry globally. Clade 2.3.4.4A was predominant in 2014/2015 while clade 2.3.4.4B was widely spread in 2016/2017. Both clades exhibited different pathotypes in ducks. Virus factors contributing to virulence and transmission are largely unknown. The NS1 protein is typically composed of 230 amino-acids (aa) and is an essential interferon (IFN) antagonist. Here, we found that the NS1 protein of clade 2.3.4.4A preferentially evolved toward long NS1 with 237-aa, while clade 2.3.4.4B evolved toward shorter NS1 with 217-aa (exclusively found in Europe) due stop-codons in the C-terminus (CTE). We showed that the NS1 CTE of H5N8 is required for efficient virus replication, transmission and endotheliotropism in ducks. In chickens, H5N8 NS1 evolved toward higher efficiency to block IFN-response. These findings may explain the preferential pattern for short NS1 and high fitness of the panzootic H5N8 in birds.\n\nSubject categoryAnimal, RNA Viruses",

    "abstract": "Mosquito midgut epithelium traversal is an essential component of transmission of malaria parasites. Phospholipid flippases are eukaryotic type IV ATPases (P4-ATPases), which in association with CDC50 cofactors, translocate phospholipids across lipid bilayers to maintain the membrane asymmetry. In this study, we investigated the function of a putative P4-ATPase, ATP7, from the rodent malaria parasite P. yoelii. Disruption of ATP7 results in block of parasite infection of mosquitoes. ATP7 is localized on the ookinete plasma membrane. While ATP7-depleted ookinetes are motile and capable of invading the midgut, they are quickly eliminated within the epithelial cells by a process that is independent from the mosquito complement-like immunity. ATP7 colocalizes and interacts with the flippase co-factor CDC50C. Importantly, depletion of CDC50C phenocopies ATP7 deficiency. ATP7-depleted ookinetes fail to translocate phosphatidylcholine (PC) across the plasma membrane, resulting in PC exposure at the ookinete surface. Lastly, ookinete microinjection into the mosquito hemocoel reverses the ATP7 deficiency phenotype. Our study identifies Plasmodium flippase as a novel mechanism of parasite survival in the midgut epithelium that is required for mosquito transmission.",

    "abstract": "PurposeTo investigate the potential of quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) with MRI as a biomarker for tissue oxygenation in fat-water mixture. Oxygen molecules (O2) are paramagnetic. This suggests that dissolved O2 in tissue should affect the measured magnetic susceptibility. However, direct measurements of dissolved O2 in tissues is challenging with QSM as the induced change in susceptibility is below the sensitivity of existing algorithms. QSM in regions that contain fat could be sensitive enough to be used as a marker of tissue oxygenation as oxygen has a larger solubility in fat than in water.\n\nMethodsThe relationship between dissolved O2 concentration and magnetic susceptibility was investigated based on MRI measurements using phantoms made of fat-water emulsions. Dairy cream was used to approximate fat-containing biological tissues. Phantoms based on dairy cream with 35 % fat were designed with controlled concentrations of dissolved O2. O2 was bubbled into the dairy cream to reach O2 concentrations above the concentration at atmospheric pressure, while nitrogen was bubbled in cream to obtain O2 concentrations below atmospheric pressure. Magnetic susceptibility was expected to increase, becoming more paramagnetic, as O2 concentration was increased.\n\nResultsMagnetic susceptibility from MRI-based QSM measurements did not reveal a dependence on O2 concentration in fat-water mixture phantoms. The relationship between susceptibility and O2 was weak and inconsistent among the various phantom experiments.\n\nConclusionQSM in fat-water mixture appears to be minimally sensitive to dissolved O2 based on phantom experiments. This suggests that QSM is not likely to be sensitive enough to be proposed as a marker for tissue oxygenation, as the change in magnetic susceptibility induced by the change in dissolved O2 concentration is below the current detection limit, even in the presence of fat.",

    "abstract": "While thermophilic enzymes have thermostability desired for broad industrial applications, they can lose activity at ambient temperatures far from their optimal. Engineering cold activity into thermophilic enzymes has the potential to broaden the range of temperatures resulting in significant activity (i.e., decreasing the temperature dependence of kcat). Even though it has been widely suggested that cold temperature enzyme activity results from active flexibility that is at odds with the rigidity necessary for thermostable enzymes; however, directed evolution experiments have shown us these properties are not mutually exclusive. In this study, rational protein engineering was used to introduce flexibility inducing mutations around the active sites of Geobacillus thermocatenulatus lipase (GTL). Two mutants were found to have enhanced specific activity compared to wild-type at temperatures between 283 K to 363 K with p-nitrophenol butyrate but not with larger substrates. Kinetics assay revealed both mutations resulted in psychrophilic traits, such as lower activation enthalpy and more negative entropy values compared to wild type in all substrates. Furthermore, the mutants had significantly improved thermostability compared to wild type enzyme, which proves that it is feasible to improve the cold activity without trade-off. Our study provides insight into the enzyme cold adaptation mechanism and design principles for engineering cold activity into thermostable enzymes.",

We thereby focused on a population of white-tailed deer from West Virginia, USA, in which CWD has been detected. Fetal tissues, ranging from 113 to 158 days of gestation, were harvested from the uteri of CWD+ dams in the asymptomatic phase of infection. Using serial protein misfolding amplification (sPMCA), we detected evidence of prion seeds in 6 of 14 in utero harvested fetuses, with earliest detection at 113 gestational days. This is the first report of CWD detection in free ranging white-tailed deer fetal tissues.

We hypothesized that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may play a role in facilitating viral uptake, and with the regulation of inflammatory and thrombotic pathways that are involved with viral infection. In this study, we identified the top differentially expressed genes upon the knockout of sigma-2R/TMEM97, and analyzed the genes involved with the inflammatory and thrombotic cascades, effects that are observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. We found that the ablation of sigma-2R/TMEM97 resulted in an increase in Complement Component 4 Binding Protein (C4BP) proteins, at both the translational and transcriptional levels. We also showed that sigma-2R/TMEM97 interacts with the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, forming a protein complex, and that disruption of this complex results in the inhibition of viral uptake. The results of this study suggest that sigma-2R/TMEM97 may be a novel therapeutic target to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 viral uptake, as well as to decrease inflammatory and thrombotic effects through the modulation of the complement cascade.",

With the recent advances in experimental techniques, there is a growing demand to build up neural models at single neuron or large-scale circuit levels. A long-standing challenge to build up such models lies in tuning the free parameters of the models to closely reproduce experimental recordings. There are many advanced machine-learning-based methods developed recently for parameter tuning, but many of them are task-specific or requires onerous manual interference. There lacks a general and fully-automated method since now. Here, we present a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based deep learning method, General Neural Estimator (GNE), to fully automate the parameter tuning procedure, which can be directly applied to both single neuronal models and large-scale neural circuits. We made comprehensive comparisons with many advanced methods, and GNE showed outstanding performance on both synthesized data and experimental data. Finally, we proposed a roadmap centered on GNE to help guide neuroscientists to computationally reconstruct single neurons and neural circuits, which might inspire future brain reconstruction techniques and corresponding experimental design.

We coupled in silico networks with varying excitatory and inhibitory connectivity, and found that phase coupling emerges at criticality, and that amplitude coupling, as well as information transfer, are maximal when networks are critical. Importantly, regulating criticality through neuromodulation of synaptic strength showed that critical dynamics--as opposed to a static ratio of excitatory and inhibitory connections--optimize network coupling and information transfer. Our data support the idea that criticality is important for local and global information processing and may help explain why brain disorders characterized by local alterations in criticality also exhibit impaired long-range synchrony, even prior to degeneration of axonal connections.",

    "abstract": "Tsetse flies are vectors of parasitic African trypanosomes (Trypanosoma spp.). Current disease control methods include fly-repelling pesticides, trapping flies, and chemotherapeutic treatment of infected people. Inhibiting tsetses ability to transmit trypanosomes by strengthening the flys natural barriers can serve as an alternative approach to reduce disease. The peritrophic matrix (PM) is a chitinous and proteinaceous barrier that lines tsetses midgut. It protects the epithelial cells from the gut lumen content such as food and invading trypanosomes, which have to overcome this physical barrier to establish an infection. Bloodstream form trypanosomes shed variant surface glycoproteins (VSG) into tsetses gut lumen early during the infection establishment. The VSG molecules are internalized by the flys PM-producing cardia, which results in a reduction in tsetse miR275 expression and a sequential molecular cascade that compromises the PM integrity. In the present study, we investigated the role(s) of miR275 in tsetses midgut physiology and trypanosome infection processes by developing a paratransgenic expression system. We used tsetses facultative bacterial endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius to express tandem antagomir-275 repeats (or miR275 sponge) that constitutively reduce miR275 transcript abundance. This paratransgenic system successfully knocked down miR275 levels in the flys midgut, which consequently obstructed blood digestion and modulated infection outcomes with an entomopathogenic bacteria and with trypanosomes. RNA sequencing of cardia and midgut tissues from the paratransgenic tsetse confirmed that miR275 regulates processes related to the expression of PM-associated proteins and digestive enzymes as well as genes that encode abundant secretory proteins. Our study demonstrates that paratransgenesis can be employed to study microRNA-regulated pathways in arthropods housing symbiotic bacteria.\n\nAuthor SummaryTsetse flies transmit African trypanosomes, which are the parasites that cause sleeping sickness in human in sub-Saharan Africa. When tsetse ingests a blood meal containing trypanosomes, the expression level of a microRNA (miR275) decreases in the flys gut. This process results in a series of events that interrupt the physiological homeostasis of the gut environment. To further understand the function of miR275 in tsetse fly, we genetically modified a tsetses native bacterial symbiont, reintroduced the genetically modified bacterium back into the fly, and successfully knocked down the miR275 expression in tsetses midgut. These  paratransgenic flies (which house genetically modified bacteria) presented impaired digestive processes and were highly susceptible to infection with trypanosomes. Lastly, we discovered that miR275 regulates tsetse secretory pathways. Our novel paratransgenic expression system can be applied to study the function of other microRNAs and how they regulate disease transmission in tsetse and other insect systems.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSeveral new variants of SARS-CoV-2 have emerged since fall 2020 which have multiple mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein.\n\nObjectiveWe aimed to assess how mutations in RBD affected recognition of immune sera by antibodies induced by natural infection versus immunization with BNT162b2, a mRNA-based vaccine against COVID-19.\n\nMethodsWe produced SARS-CoV-2 RBD mutants with single mutations in the receptor binding domain (RBD) region (E484K, K417N, N501Y) or with all 3 mutations combined, as occurring in the newly emerged variants B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil). Using standard and avidity ELISAs, we determined the binding capacities to mutant RBDs of antibodies induced by infection versus vaccination.\n\nResultsThese binding assays showed that vaccination induced antibodies recognize both wildtype and mutant RBDs with higher avidities than those raised by infection. Nevertheless, recognition of mutants RBDK417N and RBDN501Y was 2.5-3-fold reduced while RBDE484K and the triple mutant were 10-fold less well recognized, demonstrating that the mutation at position 484 was key for the observed loss in cross-reactivity.\n\nConclusionOur binding data demonstrate improved recognition of mutant viruses by BNT162b2-induced antibodies compared to those induced by natural infection. Recognition may, however, be 10-fold reduced for the variants B.1.351/P.1, suggesting that the development of a new vaccine is warranted. The E484K mutation is an key hurdle for immune recognition, convalescent plasma and monoclonal antibody therapy as well as serological assays based on the wildtype sequence may therefore seriously impaired.\n\nCapsule summaryBNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine-induced antibodies recognize mutant viruses with up to 10-fold lower efficiency",

    "abstract": "BackgroundVector-borne diseases remain major causes of human morbidity and mortality. It is increasingly recognized that the community of microbes inhabiting arthropods can strongly affect their vector competence, but the role of the tick microbiome in Borrelia transmission - the cause of Lyme disease - remains unclear.\n\nResultsHere, we use a large-scale experiment to clarify the reciprocal interactions between Borrelia afzelii and the microbiome of Ixodes ricinus, its primary vector. In contrast to other reports, we find that depletion of the bacterial microbiome in larval ticks has no effect on their subsequent acquisition of B. afzelii during blood feeding on infected mice. Rather, exposure to B. afzelii-infected hosts drives pervasive changes to the tick microbiome, decreasing overall bacterial abundance, shifting bacterial community composition, and increasing bacterial diversity. These effects appear to be independent of the acquisition of B. afzelii by ticks, suggesting they are mediated by physiological or immunological aspects of B. afzelii infection in the rodent host.\n\nConclusionsManipulation of the microbiome of I. ricinus larvae had no effect on their ability to acquire B. afzelii. In contrast, B. afzelii infection in the mouse had dramatic effects on the composition of the gut microbiome in I. ricinus nymphs. Our study demonstrates that vector-borne infections in the vertebrate host shape the microbiome of the arthropod vector.",

    "abstract": "Although weightlifting exercises and their pulling and catching derivatives have been well studied, less is known about the group of weightlifting overhead pressing derivatives (WOPDs). There were two purposes of the present study. Above all, it was to compare WOPDs (i.e. jerk and back jerk) with jump squat in enhancing sport performance such as vertical jump in the perspective of biomechanics. Furthermore, it was to gain a better understanding of the biomechanical difference between jerk and back jerk. The study compared the kinetics, kinematics, and muscle activation of the jerk, back jerk, vertical jump and jump squat. Ground reaction forces, joint angle data and electromyography were collected from 20 track and field athletes while they performed the four movements. The joint coordination pattern and EMG characters of the jump squat were more similar to those of the vertical jump. WOPDs, especially jerk, exhibited less similarity with vertical jump in joint coordination, as well as the subsequent peak activation. The electromyography data demonstrated significant differences in rectus femoris and gluteus maximus in the relative timing of peak activations and the maximum activation. Jump squat was greater in peak force (2211N) than jerk (P < .005), greater peak power (4749W) than jerk and back jerk (P < .001) and no significant difference with WOPDs in rate of force development. Back jerk produced a greater peak force (2223 N), peak power (3767W) and eccentric RFD (15965 N{middle dot}s-1) than jerk (2061N)(P < .001) (3364W)(P < .05) (12280 N{middle dot}s-1)(P < .01)and the opposite in concentric RFD that jerk (7702 N{middle dot}s-1) was greater than back jerk (5972 N{middle dot}s-1)(P < .05). We can conclude that for runner and jumpers, jump squat was better for improving vertical jump than WOPDs and back jerk is better than jerk in power training.",
