    "abstract": "Infections caused by antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens are fast becoming an important global health issue. Strains of Escherichia coli are common causal agents of urinary tract infection and can carry multiple resistance genes. This includes the gene blaCTX-M-15 that encodes for an extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL). While studying antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in the environment we isolated several strains of E. coli ST131 downstream of a WWTP in a local river. These isolates were surviving in the river sediment and characterisation proved that a multi-resistant phenotype was evident. Here, we show that E. coli strain 48 (river isolate ST131), provided a protective effect against a third-generation cephalosporin (cefotaxime) for a susceptible E. coli strain 33 (river isolate ST3576) through secretion of a functional ESBL into the growth medium. Furthermore, extracellular ESBL activity was stable for at least 24 h after secretion. Proteomic and molecular genetic analyses identified CTX-M-15 as the major secreted ESBL responsible for the observed protective effect. In contrast to previous studies, OMVs were not the sole route for CTX-M-15 secretion. Indeed, mutation of the Type I secretion system led to a significant reduction in the growth of the ESBL-producing strain as well as a significantly reduced ability to confer protective effect. We speculate that CTX-M-15 secretion, mediated through active secretion using molecular machinery provides a public goods service by facilitating the survival of otherwise susceptible bacteria in the presence of cefotaxime.\n\nAbstract importanceInfections caused by antimicrobial resistant bacterial pathogens have become an important global health issue. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) have been identified as hotspots for the dissemination of antimicrobial resistant genes/bacteria into the environment. In this study, we investigated resistance enzyme secretion by a multi-drug resistant human pathogenic E. coli, isolated from a UK river, downstream of a WWTP. We present evidence that the resistant strain actively secreted an important resistance enzyme into the surrounding medium which degraded the antibiotic cefotaxime. This research provided evidence for the mechanism for secretion of this enzyme which could indicate a new target to tackle antibiotic resistance pathogens.",

    "abstract": "Methylation can occur on histidine, lysine and arginine residues in proteins and often serves a regulatory function. Histidine methylation has recently attracted notable attention through the discovery of the human histidine methyltransferase enzymes SETD3 and METTL9. There are currently no methods to enrich histidine methylated peptides for mass spectrometry analysis and large-scale analyses of the modification are hitherto absent. In the present study we query ultra-comprehensive proteomic datasets to generate a resource of histidine methylation sites in human cells. We use this resource to explore the frequency, localization, targeted domains, protein types and sequence requirements of histidine methylation and benchmark all analyses to methylation events on lysine and arginine. Our results demonstrate that histidine methylation is widespread in human cells and tissues and that the modification is over-represented in regions of mono-spaced histidine repeats. We also report colocalization of the modification with functionally important phosphorylation sites and disease associated mutations to identify regions of likely regulatory and functional importance. Taken together, we here report a system level analysis of human histidine methylation and our results represent a comprehensive resource enabling targeted studies of individual histidine methylation events.",

    "abstract": "ObjectivesAncient DNA provides an opportunity to separate the genetic and environmental bases of complex traits by allowing direct estimation of genetic values in ancient individuals. Here, we test whether genetic scores for height in ancient individuals are predictive of their actual height, as inferred from skeletal remains. We estimate the contributions of genetic and environmental variables to observed phenotypic variation as a first step towards quantifying individual sources of morphological variation.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe collected stature estimates and femur lengths from West Eurasian skeletal remains with published genome-wide ancient DNA data (n=167, dating from 33,000-850 BP). We also recorded genetic sex, genetic ancestry, date and paleoclimate data for each individual, and{delta} 13C and{delta} 15N stable isotope values where available (n=67).\n\nResultsA polygenic score (PRS) for height predicts 6.8% of the variance in femur length in our data (n=117, SD=0.0068%, p<0.001), controlling for sex, ancestry, and date. This is consistent with the predictive power of height PRS in present-day populations and the low coverage of ancient samples. Comparatively, sex explains about 15% of the variance in femur length in our sample. Environmental effects also likely play a role in variation, independent of genetics, though with considerable uncertainty (longitude: R2=0.0317, SD=0.009, p=0.019).\n\nDiscussionPolygenic scores explain a small but significant proportion of the variance in height in ancient individuals, though not enough to make useful predictions of individual phenotypes. However, environmental variables also contribute to phenotypic outcomes and understanding their interaction with direct genetic predictions will provide a framework with which to model how plasticity and genetic changes ultimately combine to drive adaptation and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Human culture, biology, and health were shaped dramatically by the onset of agriculture ~12,000 years before present (BP). Subsistence shifts from hunting and gathering to agriculture are hypothesized to have resulted in increased individual fitness and population growth as evidenced by archaeological and population genomic data alongside a simultaneous decline in physiological health as inferred from paleopathological analyses and stature reconstructions of skeletal remains. A key component of the health decline inference is that relatively shorter statures observed for early farmers may (at least partly) reflect higher childhood disease burdens and poorer nutrition. However, while such stresses can indeed result in growth stunting, height is also highly heritable, and substantial inter-individual variation in the height genetic component within a population is typical. Moreover, extensive migration and gene flow were characteristics of multiple agricultural transitions worldwide. Here, we consider both osteological and ancient DNA data from the same prehistoric individuals to comprehensively study the trajectory of human stature variation as a proxy for health across a transition to agriculture. Specifically, we compared  predicted genetic contributions to height from paleogenomic data and  achieved adult osteological height estimated from long bone measurements on a per-individual basis for n=160 ancient Europeans from sites spanning the Upper Paleolithic to the Iron Age (~38,000-2,400 BP). We found that individuals from the Neolithic were shorter than expected (given their individual polygenic height scores) by an average of -4.47 cm relative to individuals from the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic (P=0.016). The average osteological vs. expected stature then increased relative to the Neolithic over the Copper (+2.67 cm, P=0.052), Bronze (+3.33 cm, P=0.032), and Iron Ages (+3.95 cm, P=0.094). These results were partly attenuated when we accounted for genome-wide genetic ancestry variation in our sample (which we note is partly duplicative with the individual polygenic score information). For example, in this secondary analysis Neolithic individuals were -3.48 cm shorter than expected on average relative to individuals from the Upper Paleolithic and Mesolithic (P=0.056). We also incorporated observations of paleopathological indicators of non-specific stress that can persist from childhood to adulthood in skeletal remains (linear enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, and porotic hyperostosis) into our model. Overall, our work highlights the potential of integrating disparate datasets to explore proxies of health in prehistory.",

    "abstract": "The functional properties of alginates are dictated by the monomer composition and molecular weight distribution. Mannuronan C-5 epimerases determine the former by epimerizing {beta}-D-mannuronic acid residues (M) into -L-guluronic acid residues (G). The molecular weight is affected by alginate lyases, which cleave alginate chains through {beta}-elimination. The reaction mechanisms for the epimerization and cleavage are similar and some enzymes can perform both. These dualistic enzymes share high sequence identity with mannuronan C-5 epimerases without lyase activity, and the mechanism behind their activity as well as the amino acids responsible for it are still unknown. In this study, we investigate mechanistic determinants of the bifunctional epimerase and lyase activity of AlgE7 from Azotobacter vinelandii. Based on sequence analyses, a range of AlgE7 variants were constructed and subjected to activity assays and product characterization by NMR. Our results show that the lyase activity of AlgE7 is regulated by the type of ion present: Calcium promotes it, whereas NaCl reduces it. By using defined poly-M and poly-MG substrates, the preferred cleavage sites of AlgE7 were found to be M{downarrow}XM and G{downarrow}XM, where X can be either M or G. By studying AlgE7 mutants, R148 was identified as an important residue for the lyase activity, and the point mutant R148G resulted in an enzyme with only epimerase activity. Based on the results obtained in the present study we suggest a unified catalytic reaction mechanism for both epimerase and lyase activities where H154 functions as the catalytic base and Y149 as the catalytic acid.\n\nImportancePost-harvest valorisation and upgrading of algal constituents is a promising strategy in the development of a sustainable bioeconomy based on algal biomass. In this respect, alginate epimerases and lyases are valuable enzymes for tailoring of the functional properties of alginate, a polysaccharide extracted from brown seaweed with numerous applications in food, medicine and material industries. By providing a better understanding of the reaction mechanism and of how the two enzyme reactions can be altered by changes in reaction conditions, this study opens for further applications of bacterial epimerases and lyases in enzymatic tailoring of alginate polymers.",

Understanding the influence of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 gene on clinical outcomes and related factors is critical for treatment and prevention. Here, we analyzed 209,551 high-coverage complete virus sequences and 321 RNA-seq samples to mine the mutations associated with clinical outcome in the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Several important hotspot variants were found to be associated with severe clinical outcomes. Q57H variant in ORF3a protein were found to be associated with higher mortality rate, and was high proportion in severe cases (39.36%) and 501Y.V2 strains (100%) but poorly proportional to asymptomatic cases (10.04%). T265I could change nsp2 structure and mitochondrial permeability, and evidently higher in severe cases (20.12%) and 501Y.V2 strains (100%) but lower in asymptomatic cases (1.43%). Additionally, R203K and G204R could decrease the flexibility and immunogenic property of N protein with high frequency among severe cases, VUI 202012/01 and 484K.V2 strains. Interestingly, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was more susceptible to mutation because of the high frequency of nt14408 mutation (which located in RNA polymerase) and the high expression levels of ADAR and APOBEC in severe clinical outcomes. In conclusion, several important mutation hotspots in the SARS-CoV-2 genome associated with clinical outcomes was found in our study, and that might correlate with different SARS-CoV-2 mortality rates.",

The relative position of POH segments in the cattle genome has not been studied extensively. Specific objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of allowed missing and heterozygous SNPs in ROH on their number, on the estimate of inbreeding level, and on structure of ROH segments in the cattle genome. In this study 371 Holsteinized cows from six herds were genotyped with BovineSNP50 array. To identify ROH, the consecutive and sliding runs were carried out with detectRUNS and Plink tools. Neither effect was shown for missing SNPs genotype calls. Allowing even one heterozygous SNP resulted in significant bias of ROH data. Furthermore, the sliding runs identified less ROH than consecutive runs. The mean coefficient of inbreeding across herds was 0.111 {+/-} 0.003 and 0.104 {+/-} 0.003 based on consecutive and sliding runs respectively. It was shown how, using the heterozygous SNPs in ROH, may be possible to derive a distribution of ROH segments in the cow genome. We suggested it was similar to normal distribution. Furthermore, frequency of ROH in the chromosomes did not depend on their length. Of 29 chromosomes, the most abundant with ROH were BTA 14, BTA 7, and BTA 18. The result of this study confirmed more accurately identification of ROH with consecutive runs, uneven their distribution in the cattle genome, significant bias of the data due to allowing heterozygous SNPs in ROH.",

    "abstract": "We describe a method for fragmenting, in-situ, surface-adsorbed and immobilized DNAs on polymethylmethacrylate(PMMA)-coated silicon substrates using microfluidic delivery of the cutting enzyme DNase I. Soft lithography is used to produce polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) gratings which form microfluidic channels for delivery of the enzyme. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used to reduce DNase I adsorption to the walls of the microchannels and enable diffusion of the cutting enzyme to a distance of 10mm. Due to the DNAs being immobilized, the fragment order is maintained on the surface. Possible methods of preserving the order for application to sequencing are discussed.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundCommercial manufacturers have formulated diets to promote not only weight reduction but also to reduce risks of chronic diseases. The objective of this study is to determine if these formulations satisfy requirements for essential nutrients.\n\nMethodsWe have selected two established commercial diets, one low fat, high carbohydrate (diet 1) and the other, high fat, low carbohydrate (diet 2) and determined \"representative meals\" through use of recipes suggested in the manufacturers manuals. Nutrition Data System for Research (NDSR) software has been used to perform the most extensive nutrient analysis to date of these diets. Tables report macronutrients (energy), vitamins, minerals, essential amino acids, essential lipids and nutrient-related components for a total of 62entries.\n\nResultsDiet 1 satisfied requirements for 50 of these (81%) with only vitamin B12, vitamin D, and essential fatty acids not reaching recommended levels, while fiber and glycemic load exceeded suggested values. Diet 2 satisfied requirements for 46 of the components (71%) but had excess percentage of fat, especially saturated fat, sodium and cholesterol as well as decreased percentage of carbohydrate resulting in suboptimal intake of B-complex vitamins (B1, niacin and total folate) as well as fiber.\n\nConclusionsNeither diet satisfied adequacy for all reported nutrients. However, based on nutrient content alone diet 1, if supplemented or modified, could be sustained over the long term whereas diet 2 should not be encouraged for long term adaptation",

    "abstract": "Wolbachia are endosymbionts of numerous arthropod and some nematode species, are important for their development and if present can cause distinct phenotypes of their hosts. Prophage DNA has been frequently detected in Wolbachia, but particles of Wolbachia bacteriophages (phage WO) have been only occasionally isolated. Here, we report the characterization and isolation of a phage WO of the southern ground cricket, Allonemobius socius, and provided the first whole-genome sequence of phage WO from this arthropod family outside of Asia. We screened A. socius abdomen DNA extracts from a cricket population in eastern Missouri by quantitative PCR for Wolbachia surface protein and phage WO capsid protein and found a prevalence of 55% and 50%, respectively, with many crickets positive for both. Immunohistochemistry using antibodies against Wolbachia surface protein showed many Wolbachia clusters in the reproductive system of female crickets. Whole-genome sequencing using Oxford Nanopore MinION and Illumina technology allowed for the assembly of a high-quality, 55 kb phage genome containing 63 open reading frames (ORF) encoding for phage WO structural proteins and host lysis and transcriptional manipulation. Taxonomically important regions of the assembled phage genome were validated by Sanger sequencing of PCR amplicons. Analysis of the nucleotides sequences of the ORFs encoding the large terminase subunit (ORF2) and minor capsid (ORF7) frequently used for phage WO phylogenetics showed highest homology to phage WOKue of the Mediterranean flour moth Ephestia kuehniella (94.18% identity) and WOLig of the coronet moth, Craniophora ligustri (96.86% identity), respectively. Transmission electron microscopy examination of cricket ovaries showed a high density of phage particles within Wolbachia cells. Isolation of phage WO revealed particles characterized by 40-62 nm diameter heads and up to 190 nm long tails. This study provides the first detailed description and genomic characterization of phage WO from North America that is easily accessible in a widely distributed cricket species.",

    "abstract": "Molecular techniques and phenotypic characterisation have been used to differentiate aflatoxigenic and atoxigenic Aspergillus flavus strains. However, there is a lack of a consistent and reliable tool for discrimination between these strains of A. flavus. Here we report, an optimised real-time qPCR-based tool for reliable differentiation between aflatoxigenic and atoxigenic strains of A. flavus. Accordingly, expression profiles and deletion patterns of genes responsible for aflatoxin production in five representative aflatoxigenic and atoxigenic A. flavus strains (KSM012, KSM014, HB021, HB026 and HB027) were examined using the optimised real-time qPCR tool. We observed that under induced conditions, aflP, aflS, aflR and aflO transcripts were the most upregulated genes across the tested isolates while aflS and aflO were always expressed in both induced and uninduced isolates. However, aflR and aflP did not give clear distinctions between non-toxin and toxin producing isolates. The deletion patterns were prominent for aflD and aflR whereas alfO, aflS and aflP had no deletions among the isolates. Significant variation in transcript abundance for aflD, aflR and aflS were observed for aflatoxigenic isolate KSM014 under induced and uninduced states. False detection of aflD gene transcript in atoxigenic strain KSM012 was evident in both induced and uninduced conditions. With the exception of KSM012, aflP gene did not exhibit significant variation in expression in the isolates between induced and uninduced conditions. One-way ANOVA and Post-test analysis for linear trends revealed that aflatoxin biosynthetic cluster genes show significant (P < 0.05) differences between atoxigenic and aflatoxigenic isolates. Our optimized qPCR-based tool reliably discriminated between aflatoxigenic and atoxigenic A. flavus isolates and could complement existing detection methods.",

    "abstract": "The ctenophore nerve net represents one of the earliest evolved nervous system of animals. Due to the uncertainties of their phylogenetic placement of ctenophores and the absence of several key bilaterian neuronal genes, it has been hypothesized that their neurons have evolved independently. Whether this is indeed the case remains unclear, and thus the evolutionary history of neurons is still contentious. Here, we have characterized the neuropeptide repertoire of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi. Using the machine learning NeuroPID tool1 129 new putative neuropeptide precursors were predicted. Sixteen of them are detected in the subepithelial nerve net (SNN), aboral organ (AO) and epithelial sensory cells (ESC) of early cydippid-stage M. leidyi by in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Four of these neuropeptides increase the animals swimming velocity in a behavioral essay. The new neuropeptides were used as markers to identify neuronal cell types in single cell transcriptomic data2. To unravel the neuronal architecture, we 3D reconstructed the SNN underlying the comb plates using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM). For the first time, we confirm a more than 100 years old hypothesis about anastomoses between neurites of the same cell in ctenophores and reveal that they occur through a continuous membrane. Our findings reveal the unique neuronal structure and neuropeptide repertoire of ctenophores and are important for reconstructing the evolutionary origin of animal neurons and nervous systems.",
