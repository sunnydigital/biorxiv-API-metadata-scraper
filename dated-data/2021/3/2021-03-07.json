    "abstract": "Loss of functional RAB18 causes the autosomal recessive condition Warburg Micro syndrome. To better understand this disease, we used proximity biotinylation to generate an inventory of potential RAB18 effectors. A restricted set of 28 RAB18-interactions were dependent on the binary RAB3GAP1-RAB3GAP2 RAB18-guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) complex. 12 of these 28 interactions are supported by prior reports and we have directly validated novel interactions with SEC22A, TMCO4 and INPP5B. Consistent with a role for RAB18 in regulating membrane contact sites (MCSs), interactors included groups of microtubule/membrane-remodelling proteins, membrane-tethering and docking proteins, and lipid-modifying/transporting proteins. Two of the putative interactors, EBP and OSBPL2/ORP2, have sterol substrates. EBP (emopamil binding protein) is a {Delta}8-{Delta}7 sterol isomerase and OSBPL2/ORP2 is a lipid transport protein. This prompted us to investigate a role for RAB18 in cholesterol biosynthesis. We find that the cholesterol precursor and EBP-product lathosterol accumulates in both RAB18-null HeLa cells and RAB3GAP1-null fibroblasts derived from an affected individual. Further, de novo cholesterol biosynthesis is impaired in cells in which RAB18 is absent or dysregulated. Our data demonstrate that GEF-dependent Rab-interactions are highly amenable to interrogation by proximity biotinylation and may suggest that Micro syndrome is a cholesterol biosynthesis disorder.",

    "abstract": "Discovering and developing pharmaceutical drugs increasingly relies on mechanistic mathematical modeling and simulation. In immuno-oncology, models that capture causal relations among genetic drivers of oncogenesis, functional plasticity, and host immunity provide an important complement to wet experiments, given the cellular complexity and dynamics within tumors. Unfortunately, formulating such mechanistic cell-level models currently relies on hand curation by experts, which can bias how data is interpreted or the priority of drug targets. In modeling molecular-level networks, rules and algorithms have been developed to limit a priori biases in formulating mechanistic models. To realize an equivalent approach for cell-level networks, we combined digital cytometry with Bayesian network inference to generate causal models that link an increase in gene expression associated with onco-genesis with alterations in stromal and immune cell subsets directly from bulk transcriptomic datasets. To illustrate, we predicted how an increase in expression of Cell Communication Network factor 4 (CCN4/WISP1) altered the tumor microenvironment using data from patients diagnosed with breast cancer and melanoma. Digital cytometry and network inference predictions were then tested using two immunocompetent mouse models for melanoma, which provided consistent experimental results.",

While essential for reproducibility, sharing MEG data has unforeseen privacy risks. Individual differences may make a participant identifiable from their anonymized recordings. However, our ability to identify individuals based on these individual differences has not yet been assessed. Here, we propose interpretable MEG features to characterize individual difference. We term these features brainprints (brain fingerprints). We show through several datasets that brainprints accurately identify individuals across days, tasks, and even between MEG and Electroencephalography (EEG). Furthermore, we identify consistent brainprint components that are important for identification. We study the dependence of identifiability on the amount of data available. We also relate identifiability to the level of preprocessing, the experimental task. Our findings reveal specific aspects of individual variability in MEG.

    "abstract": "During adolescence, youth venture out, explore the wider world, and are challenged to learn how to navigate novel and uncertain environments. We investigated whether adolescents are uniquely adapted to this transition, compared to younger children and adults. In a stochastic, volatile reversal-learning task with a sample of 291 participants aged 8-30, we found that adolescents outperformed both younger and older participants. We developed two independent cognitive models, based on Reinforcement learning (RL) and Bayesian inference (BI). The RL parameter for learning from negative outcomes and the BI parameters specifying participants mental models peaked closest to optimal in adolescents, suggesting a central role in adolescent cognitive processing. By contrast, persistence and noise parameters improved monotonously with age. We distilled the insights of RL and BI using principal component analysis and found that three shared components interacted to form the adolescent performance peak: adult-like behavioral quality, child-like time scales, and developmentally-unique processing of positive feedback. This research highlights adolescence as a neurodevelopmental window that may be specifically adapted for volatile and uncertain environments. It also shows how detailed insights can be gleaned by using cognitive models in new ways.",

    "abstract": "Plant long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of chromatin dynamics, impacting on transcriptional programs leading to different developmental outputs. The lncRNA AUXIN REGULATED PROMOTER LOOP (APOLO) directly recognizes multiple independent loci across the Arabidopsis genome and modulates their three-dimensional chromatin conformation, leading to transcriptional shifts. Here, we show that APOLO recognizes the locus encoding the root hair (RH) master regulator ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6) and controls RHD6 transcriptional activity leading to cold-enhanced RH elongation through the consequent activation of the transcription factor gene RHD6-like RSL4. Furthermore, we demonstrate that APOLO interacts with the transcription factor WRKY42 and modulates its binding to the RHD6 promoter. WRKY42 is required for the activation of RHD6 by low temperatures and WRKY42 deregulation impairs cold-induced RH expansion. Collectively, our results indicate that a novel ribonucleoprotein complex involving APOLO and WRKY42 forms a regulatory hub which activates RHD6 by shaping its epigenetic environment and integrates signals governing RH growth and development.\n\nSUMMARYThe lncRNA APOLO directly regulates the transcription of the root hair-master gene RHD6. In response to cold, APOLO is induced and it decoys the H3K27me3-binding protein LHP1 away from RHD6. In addition, APOLO modulates the binding of the transcription factor WRKY42 to the RHD6 promoter at low temperatures.",

    "abstract": "Dispersal is a central determinant of spatial dynamics in communities and ecosystems, and various ecological factors can shape the evolution of constitutive and plastic dispersal behaviours. One important driver of dispersal plasticity is the biotic environment. Parasites, for example, influence the internal condition of infected hosts and define external patch quality. Thus state-dependent dispersal may be determined by infection status and context-dependent dispersal by the abundance of infected hosts in the population. A prerequisite for such dispersal plasticity to evolve is a genetic basis on which natural selection can act. Using interconnected microcosms, we investigated dispersal in experimental populations of the freshwater protist Paramecium caudatum in response to the bacterial parasite Holospora undulata. For a collection of 20 natural host strains, we found substantial variation in constitutive dispersal, and to a lesser degree in dispersal plasticity. First, infection tended to increase or decrease dispersal relative to uninfected controls, depending on strain identity, potentially indicative of state-dependent dispersal plasticity. Infection additionally decreased host swimming speed compared to the uninfected counterparts. Second, for certain strains, there was a weak negative association between dispersal and infection prevalence, such that uninfected hosts tended to disperse less when infection was more frequent in the population, indicating context-dependent dispersal plasticity. Future experiments may test whether the observed differences in dispersal plasticity are sufficiently strong to react to natural selection. The evolution of dispersal plasticity as a strategy to mitigate parasite effects spatially may have important implications for epidemiological dynamics.",

    "abstract": "Virtual reality (VR) has garnered much interest as a training environment for motor skill acquisition, including for neurological rehabilitation of upper extremities. While the focus has been on gross upper limb motion, VR applications that involve reaching for, and interacting with, virtual objects are growing. The absence of true haptics in VR when it comes to hand-object interactions raises a fundamentally important question: can haptic-free immersive virtual environments (hf-VEs) support naturalistic coordination of reach-to-grasp movements? This issue has been grossly understudied, and yet is of significant importance in the development and application of VR across a number of sectors. In a previous study (Furmanek et al. 2019), we reported that reach-to-grasp movements are similarly coordinated in both the physical environment (PE) and hf-VE. The most noteworthy difference was that the closure phase--which begins at maximum aperture and lasts through the end of the movement--was longer in hf-VE than in PE, suggesting that different control laws might govern the initiation of closure between the two environments. To do so, we reanalyzed data from Furmanek et al. (2019), in which the participants reached to grasp three differently sized physical objects, and matching 3D virtual object renderings, placed at three different locations. Our analysis revealed two key findings pertaining to the initiation of closure in PE and hf-VE. First, the respective control laws governing the initiation of aperture closure in PE and hf-VE both included state estimates of transport velocity and acceleration, supporting a general unified control policy for implementing reach-to-grasp across physical and virtual environments. Second, aperture was less informative to the control law in hf-VE. We suggest that the latter was likely because transport velocity at closure onset and aperture at closure onset were less independent in hf-VE than in PE, ultimately resulting in aperture at closure onset having a weaker influence on the initiation of closure. In this way, the excess time and muscular effort needed to actively bring the fingers to a stop at the interface of a virtual object was factored into the control law governing the initiation of closure in hf-VE. Critically, this control law remained applicable, albeit with different weights in hf-VE, despite the absence of terminal haptic feedback and potential perceptual differences.",

    "abstract": "Environmental cues in an ecological niche are often temporal in nature. For instance, in temperate climates, temperature is higher in daytime compared to during night. In response to these temporal cues, bacteria have been known to exhibit anticipatory regulation, whereby they trigger response to a yet to appear cue, anticipating its actual arrival in the near future. Such an anticipatory response in known to enhance Darwinian fitness, and hence, is likely an important feature of regulatory networks in microorganisms. However, the conditions under which an anticipatory response evolves as an adaptive response are not known. In this work, we develop a quantitative model to study response of a population to two temporal environmental cues, and predict variables which are likely important for evolution of anticipatory regulatory response. We follow this with experimental evolution of E. coli in alternating environments of a pentose sugar, rhamnose, and an oxidative stress molecule, paraquat for more than 800 generations. We demonstrate that growth in this cyclical environment leads to evolution of anticipatory regulation, whereby, exposure to rhamnose leads to partial induction of the oxidative stress response regulon. As a result, pre-exposure to rhamnose leads to a greater fitness in paraquat environment. Overall, we show that in niches where environmental stimuli have a cyclical nature, anticipatory regulation can evolve as an adaptive strategy, in a time course of a few hundred generations. This contributes to our understanding of how environment shapes the topology of regulatory networks in an organism.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), applied to two brain sites with different phase lags, has been shown to modulate stimulation-outlasting functional EEG connectivity between the targeted regions. Given the lack of knowledge on mechanisms of tACS aftereffects, it is difficult to further enhance effect sizes and reduce variability in experiments. In this computational study, we tested if spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can explain stimulation-outlasting connectivity modulation by dual-site tACS and explored the effects of tACS parameter choices. Two populations of spiking neurons were coupled with synapses subject to STDP, and results were validated via a re-analysis of EEG data. Our simulations showed stimulation-outlasting connectivity changes between in- and anti-phase tACS, dependent on both tACS frequency and synaptic conduction delays. Importantly, both a simple network entraining to a wide range of tACS frequencies as well as a more realistic network that spontaneously oscillated at alpha frequency predicted that the largest effects would occur for short conduction delays between the stimulated regions. This finding agreed with experimental EEG connectivity modulation by 10 Hz tACS, showing a clear negative correlation of tACS effects with estimated conduction delays between regions. In conclusion, STDP can explain connectivity aftereffects of dual-site tACS. However, not all combinations of tACS frequency and application sites are expected to effectively modulate connectivity via STDP. We therefore suggest using appropriate computational models and/or EEG analysis for planning and interpretation of dual-site tACS studies relying on aftereffects.\n\nHighlightsO_LINetwork model with STDP explains EEG connectivity change after dual-site tACS\nC_LIO_LIEffects are predicted to depend on tACS frequency and conduction delays\nC_LIO_LIEEG data confirm dependence on conduction delays between regions\nC_LIO_LIModel can be used to estimate and maximize experimental effects\nC_LI",

The annotation of signal peptides is important for understanding protein translocation and toxin secretion and evolution.\n\nResultsHere we explore the features of these signal sequences from eukaryotic proteins. Strikingly, we find that the signal peptides from secretory toxins have common features across kingdoms, supporting the idea of horizontal gene transfer or convergence of toxin genes across kingdoms. We leverage these features to build Razor, a simple yet powerful tool specialised in identifying signal peptides from toxins using the first 23 N-terminal residues. We demonstrate the usability of Razor by analysing all the sequences reviewed by UniProt. Indeed, Razor is able to identify toxins using their N-terminal sequences only. Strikingly, we also discover that many defensive proteins across kingdoms harbour a toxin-like signal peptide; some of these defensive proteins have emerged through convergent evolution, e.g. defensin and defensin-like protein families, and phospholipase families. In sum, Razor uses an approach independent of homology search to identify novel and known toxin classes across species using N-terminal residues.\n\nAvailability and implementationRazor is available as a web application (https://tisigner.com/razor) and a command-line tool (https://github.com/Gardner-BinfLab/Razor).",

    "abstract": "The ability to control transgene expression, both spatially and temporally, is essential for studying model organisms. In Drosophila, spatial control is primarily provided by the GAL4/UAS system, whilst temporal control relies on a temperature-sensitive GAL80 (which inhibits GAL4) and drug-inducible systems. However, these are not ideal. Shifting temperature can impact on many physiological and behavioural traits, and the current drug-inducible systems are either leaky, toxic, incompatible with existing GAL4-driver lines, or do not generate effective levels of expression. Here we describe the Auxin-inducible Gene Expression System (AGES). AGES relies on the auxin-dependent degradation of a ubiquitously expressed GAL80, and therefore, is compatible with existing GAL4-driver lines. Water-soluble auxin is added to fly food at a low, non-lethal, concentration, which induces expression comparable to uninhibited GAL4 expression. The system works in both larvae and adults, providing a stringent, non-lethal, cost-effective, and convenient method for temporally controlling GAL4 activity in Drosophila.",

We demonstrate that addition of exogenous H2O2 to human fibroblasts infected with T. gondii triggers a Ca2+ flux in the cytosol of intracellular parasites that can induce egress. In line with existing models, egress triggered by exogenous H2O2 is reliant upon both Calcium-Dependent Protein Kinase 3 and diacylglycerol kinases. Finally, we show that the overexpression a glutaredoxin-roGFP2 redox sensor fusion protein in the parasitophorous vacuole severely impacts parasite replication. These data highlight the rich redox network that exists in T. gondii, evidencing a link between extracellular redox and intracellular Ca2+ signaling that can culminate in parasite egress. Our findings also indicate that the redox potential of the intracellular environment contributes to normal parasite growth. Combined, our findings highlight the important role of redox as an unexplored regulator of parasite biology.",

    "abstract": "Emerin is an integral nuclear envelope protein participating in the maintenance of nuclear shape. When mutated or absent, emerin causes X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). To define how emerin takes parts in molecular scaffolding at the nuclear envelope and helps protect the nucleus against mechanical stress, we established its nanoscale organization using single molecule tracking and super-resolution microscopy. We show that emerin monomers form localized oligomeric nanoclusters stabilized by both lamin A/C and SUN1 at the LINC complex. Interactions of emerin with nuclear actin and BAF additionally modulate its membrane mobility and its ability to oligomerize. In nuclei subjected to mechanical challenges, the mechanotransducing functions of emerin are coupled to changes in its oligomeric state, and the incremental self-assembly of emerin determines nuclear shape adaptation against forces. We also show that the abnormal nuclear envelope deformations induced by EDMD emerin mutants stem from an improper formation of lamin A/C and LINC complex-stabilized emerin oligomers. These findings place emerin at the center of the molecular processes that regulate nuclear shape remodeling in response to mechanical challenges.",

    "abstract": "Parasitoids, as important natural enemies, help maintain balance in natural ecosystems. Their population dynamics is generally predicted from the number of individuals. Here, using gregarious parasitoids as models, we show that this traditional approach omits one important parameter: the mothers manipulation of offspring fertility due to the clutch size-body size- fertility correlation. As a result of this correlation, when females deliberately adjust the number of offspring laid in a host, they determine not only the number but also the body sizes and reproductive potentials of those offspring. For the first time in the model species Anaphes flavipes, we determined the parasitoids offspring fertility from clutch size. Using this, we experimentally clarified the advantage of specific clutch size combinations and we show that identical fertility in the F1 generation can lead to distinctly different fertility values in the F2 generation. Even with the same number of hosts, lower fertility in the F1 generation can cause higher fertility in the F2 generation. Based on these results, we propose a novel two-generation approach which includes the clutch size-body size-fertility correlation. Our novel approach provides a new perspective for determining the individual fitness levels of gregarious parasitoids with new options for the modelling of parasitoid population dynamics.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundWhen studying the relationship between the microbiome and a disease, a common question asked is what individual microbes are differentially abundant between a disease and healthy state. Numerous differential abundance (DA) testing methods exist and range from standard statistical tests to methods specifically designed for microbiome data. Comparison studies of DA testing methods have been performed, but none were performed on microbiome datasets collected for the study of real, complex disease. Due to this, we performed DA testing of microbial genera using 16 DA methods in two large, uniformly collected gut microbiome datasets on Parkinson disease (PD), and compared their results.\n\nResultsPairwise concordances between methods ranged from 46%-99% similarity. Average pairwise concordance per dataset was 76%, and dropped to 62% when taking replication of signals across datasets into account. Certain methods consistently resulted in above average concordances (e.g. Kruskal-Wallis, ALDEx2, GLM with centered-log-ratio transform), while others consistently resulted in lower than average concordances (e.g. edgeR, fitZIG). Overall, [~]80% of genera tested were detected as differentially abundant by at least one method in each dataset. Requiring associations to replicate across datasets reduced significant signals by almost half. Further requirement of signals to be replicated by the majority of methods ([&ge;]8) yielded 19 associations. Only one genus (Agathobacter) was replicated by all methods. Use of hierarchical clustering revealed three groups of DA signatures that were (1) replicated by the majority of methods and included genera previously associated with PD, (2) replicated by few or no methods, and (3) replicated by a subset of methods and included rarer genera, all enriched in PD.\n\nConclusionsDifferential abundance tests yielded varied results. Using one method on one dataset may find true associations, but may also detect non-reproducible signals, adding to inconsistency in the literature. To help lower false positives, one might analyze data with two or more DA methods to gauge concordance, and use a built-in replication dataset to show reproducibility. This study corroborated previously reported microorganism associations in PD, and revealed a potential new group of microorganisms whose abundance is significantly elevated in PD, and might be worth pursuing in future investigations.",

Here, we develop a method to detect single RNA molecules and quantify localization patterns in skeletal myofibers, and we uncover a critical and general role for directed transport of RNPs in muscle. We find that RNAs are localized and translated along cytoskeletal filaments, and we identify the Z-disk as a biological hub for RNA localization and protein synthesis. We show that muscle development triggers complete reliance on the lattice-like microtubule network to transport RNAs and that disruption of microtubules leads to striking accumulation of RNPs and nascent protein around myonuclei. Our observations suggest that active transport may be globally required to distribute RNAs in highly differentiated cells and reveal fundamental mechanisms relevant to myopathies caused by perturbations to RNPs, microtubules, and the nuclear envelope.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/433059v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (88K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d801ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@625623org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@54230org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@13c95be_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "The formation of three-dimensional ordered spatial patterns, which is essential for embryonic development, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis, is mainly guided by the chemical concentration gradient of morphogens. However, since no chemical concentration gradient has been observed in the early embryonic development (pre-implantation) of mammals, the pattern formation mechanism has been unsolved for a long time. During the second cell fate decision of mouse embryos, the inner cell mass (ICM) segregates into topographically regionalized epiblast (EPI) and primitive endoderm (PrE) layers. Here, we report that the segregation process of PrE/EPI precursors coincides with an emerged periodic expansion-contraction vibration of the blastocyst cavity, which induces phase transition in the ICM compartment to a higher fluidity state and generates directional tissue flows. By experiments and modeling, we demonstrate that the spatial segregation of PrE and EPI precursors is mediated by a \"Brazil nut effect\"-like viscous segregation mechanism in which PrE precursors with low affinity gradually migrate to the surface of ICM along with the tissue flow, while EPI precursors with high affinity remains inside ICM under cavity vibration. Artificially manipulation of the frequency and amplitude of cavity vibration could control the process of spatial separation as well as lineage specification of PrE/EPI. Furthermore, disruption of the cavity vibration in the initial stage after segregation could reverse the ICM cells back to a mixed state. Therefore, this study reveals a fundamental mechanism that guarantees the robustness of cell segregation and pattern formation without specific morphogens in early mammalian embryos. Our model also emphasizes a conserved function of cavity structure that widely exists in organisms as an energy reservoir and converter between different forms, such as chemical and mechanical energy.",

Here we find that even at the early larval stage, zebrafish regulate their proximity and alignment with each other. Two simple visual responses, one that measures relative visual field occupancy and the other global visual motion, suffice to account for the group behavior that emerges. We analyze how mutations in genes known to affect social behavior of humans perturb these simple reflexes in larval zebrafish and thereby affect their collective behaviors. We use model simulations to show that changes in reflexive responses of individual mutant animals predict well the distinctive collective patterns that emerge in a group. Hence group behaviors reflect in part genetically defined primitive sensorimotor \"motifs\", which are evident even in young larvae.",

    "abstract": "The root system is critical for the survival of nearly all land plants and a key target for improving abiotic stress tolerance, nutrient accumulation, and yield in crop species. Although many methods of root phenotyping exist, within field studies one of the most popular methods is the extraction and measurement of the upper portion of the root system, known as the root crown, followed by trait quantification based on manual measurements or 2D imaging. However, 2D techniques are inherently limited by the information available from single points of view. Here, we used X-ray computed tomography to generate highly accurate 3D models of maize root crowns and created computational pipelines capable of measuring 71 features from each sample. This approach improves estimates of the genetic contribution to root system architecture, and is refined enough to detect various changes in global root system architecture over developmental time as well as more subtle changes in root distributions as a result of environmental differences. We demonstrate that root pulling force, a high-throughput method of root extraction that provides an estimate of root biomass, is associated with multiple 3D traits from our pipeline. Our combined methodology can therefore be used to calibrate and interpret root pulling force measurements across a range of experimental contexts, or scaled up as a stand-alone approach in large genetic studies of root system architecture.",

    "abstract": "One of the key mechanisms employed by cells to control their spatiotemporal organization is the formation and dissolution of phase-separated condensates. The balance between condensate assembly and disassembly can be critically regulated by the presence of RNA. In this work, we use a novel sequence-dependent coarse-grained model for proteins and RNA to unravel the impact of RNA in modulating the transport properties and stability of biomolecular condensates. We explore the phase behavior of several RNA-binding proteins such as FUS, hnRNPA1 and TDP-43 proteins along with that of their corresponding prion-like domains and RNA-recognition motifs, from absence to moderately high RNA concentration. By characterising the phase diagram, key molecular interactions, surface tension and transport properties of the condensates, we report a dual RNA-induced behavior: On the one hand, RNA enhances phase separation at low concentration as long as the RNA radius of gyration is comparable to that of the proteins, whilst at high concentration it inhibits the ability of proteins to self-assemble independently of its length. On the other hand, along with the stability modulation, the viscosity of the condensates can be considerably reduced at high RNA concentration as long as the length of the RNA chains is shorter than that of the proteins. Conversely, long RNA strands increase viscosity, even at high concentration, but barely modify protein self-diffusion, which mainly depends on RNA concentration and on its own effect on droplet density. On the whole, our work rationalizes the different routes by which RNA can regulate phase separation and condensate dynamics, as well as the subsequent aberrant rigidification implicated in the emergence of various neuropathologies and age-related diseases.",

Accordingly, principal neurons at the CA1 output node of the hippocampus are increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous population. Their genes, molecular content, intrinsic morpho-physiology, connectivity, and function seem to segregate along the main anatomical axes of the hippocampus. Since these axes reflect the temporal order of principal cell neurogenesis, we directly examined the relationship between birthdate and CA1 pyramidal neuron diversity, focusing on the ventral hippocampus. We used a genetic fate-mapping approach that allowed tagging three groups of agematched principal neurons: pioneer, early- and late-born. Using a combination of neuroanatomy, slice physiology, connectivity tracing and cFos staining, we show that birthdate is a strong predictor of CA1 principal cell diversity. We unravel a subpopulation of pioneer neurons recruited in familiar environments with remarkable positioning, morpho-physiological features, and connectivity. Therefore, despite the expected plasticity of hippocampal circuits, given their role in learning and memory, the diversity of their main components is significantly predetermined at the earliest steps of development.",

In contrast to L-MSCs from aged mice, young L-MSCs support the efficient formation of alveolospheres when co-cultured with young or aged AEC2s. Aged L-MSCs demonstrated features of cellular senescence, altered bioenergetics, and a senescence-associated secretory profile (SASP). The reactive oxygen species generating enzyme, NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4), was highly activated in aged L-MSCs and Nox4 downregulation was sufficient to, at least partially, reverse this age-related energy deficit, while restoring the self-organizing capacity of alveolospheres. Together, these data indicate a critical role for cellular bioenergetics and redox homeostasis in an organoid model of self-organization, and supports the concept of thermodynamic entropy in aging biology.",

The goal of this study was to use mouse models to investigate contributions of bile acid transporters to the choleretic actions of norUDCA. Here, we show that the apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) and Organic solute transporter-alpha (OST) are dispensable for norUDCA-stimulation of bile flow and biliary bicarbonate secretion in mice. Analysis of the liver transcriptome revealed that norUDCA induced hepatic expression of a limited number of transporter genes, particularly organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a4 (Oatp1a4). However, norUDCA potently stimulated a bicarbonate-rich hypercholeresis in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Blocking intestinal bile acid reabsorption by co-administration of an ASBT inhibitor or bile acid sequestrant did not impact the ability of norUDCA to induce bile flow in wildtype mice. The results support the concept that these major bile acid transporters are not directly involved in the absorption, cholehepatic shunting, or choleretic actions of norUDCA. Additionally, the findings support further investigation of the therapeutic synergy between norUDCA and ASBT inhibitors or bile acid sequestrants for cholestatic liver disease.",

How cells dynamically organize their contact with neighbouring cells in these tightly packed tissues is poorly understood. We have used light-sheet microscopy of growing mouse embryonic lung explants, three-dimensional cell segmentation, and physical theory to unravel the principles behind 3D cell organization in growing pseudostratified epithelia. We find that cells have highly irregular 3D shapes and exhibit numerous neighbour intercalations along the apical-basal axis as well as over time. Despite the fluidic nature, the cell packing configurations follow fundamental relationships previously described for apical epithelial layers, i.e., Eulers formula, Lewis law, and Aboav-Weaires law, at all times and across the entire tissue thickness. This arrangement minimizes the lateral cell-cell surface energy for a given cross-sectional area variability, generated primarily by the distribution and movement of nuclei. We conclude that the complex 3D cell organization in growing epithelia emerges from simple physical principles.",

Here we report a first-in-class chemical probe targeting the N-terminal PWWP (PWWP1) domain of NSD2. UNC6934 binds potently (Kd of 91 {+/-} 8 nM) to PWWP1, antagonizes its interaction with nucleosomal H3K36me2, and selectively engages endogenous NSD2 in cells. Crystal structures show that UNC6934 occupies the canonical H3K36me2-binding pocket of PWWP1 which is juxtaposed to the DNA-binding surface. In cells, UNC6934 induces accumulation of endogenous NSD2 in the nucleolus, phenocopying the localization defects of NSD2 protein isoforms lacking PWWP1 as a result of translocations prevalent in multiple myeloma. Mutation of other NSD2 chromatin reader domains also increases NSD2 nucleolar localization, and enhances the effect of UNC6934. Finally we identified two C-terminal nucleolar localization sequences in NSD2 that appear to drive nucleolar accumulation when one or more chromatin reader domains are disabled. These data support a model in which NSD2 chromatin engagement is achieved in a cooperative manner and subcellular localization is controlled by multiple competitive structural determinants. This chemical probe and the accompanying negative control, UNC7145, will be useful tools in defining NSD2 biology.",

    "abstract": "Local signals provided by cells in specialized niche microenvironments regulate stem cell behaviour in many different organs and species. In adult mammalian bone marrow (BM), leptin receptor-positive (LepR+) reticular cells express secreted factors that control the function of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). During fetal development, the developing skeletal system is colonized by c-Kit+ haematopoietic cells de novo after a transient phase of liver haematopoiesis. The cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating de novo haematopoietic cell colonization and expansion remain largely unknown. Here, we report that fetal and adult BM exhibit fundamental differences both in terms of cellular composition and molecular interactions by single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis. While LepR+ reticular cells are almost completely absent in fetal femur, arterial endothelial cells (AECs) are a source of signals controlling the initial HSPC expansion during BM development. Long-term haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and other c-Kit+ HSPCs are reduced when Wnt ligand secretion by AECs is genetically blocked. We identify Wnt2 as an AEC-derived signal that directly activates {beta}-catenin dependent proliferation of fetal HSPCs. Treatment of HSPCs ex vivo with Wnt2 promotes their proliferation and improves engraftment in vivo after transplantation. Our work reveals a fundamental switch in the cellular organization and molecular regulation of BM niches in the embryonic and adult organism.",

    "abstract": "The mechanical micro-environment of cells and tissues influences key aspects of cell structure and function including cell motility. For proper tissue development, cells need to migrate, interact with other neighbouring cells and form contacts, each of which require the cell to exert physical forces. Cells are known to exert contractile forces on underlying soft substrates. These stresses result in substrate deformation that can affect migratory behavior of cells as well as provide an avenue for cells to sense each other and coordinate their motion. The role of substrate mechanics, particularly its stiffness, in such biological processesis therefore a subject of active investigation. Recent progress in experimental techniques have enabled key insights into pairwise mechanical interactions that control cell motility when they move on compliant soft substrates. Analysis and modeling of such systemsis however still in its nascent stages. Motivated by the role modeling is expected to play in interpreting, informing and guiding experiments, we build a biophysical model for cell migration and cell-cell interactions. Our focus is on situations highly relevant to tissue engineering and regenerative medicine -when substrate traction stresses induced by motile cells enable substrate deformation and serve as a medium of communication. Using a generalizable agent-basedmodel, we compute key metrics of cell motile behavior such as the number of cell-cell contacts over a given time, dispersion of cell trajectories, and probability of permanent cell contact, and analyze how these depend on a cell motility parameter and on substrate stiffness. Our results provide a framework towards modeling the manner in which cells may sense each other mechanically via the substrate and use this information to generate coordinated movements across much longer length scales. Our results also provide a foundation to analyze experiments on the phenomenon known as durotaxis where single cells move preferentially towards regions of high stiffness on patterned substrates.",

    "abstract": "Spindlin1 is a transcriptional coactivator with three Tudor-like domains, of which the first and second Tudors are engaged in histone methylation readout, while the function of the third Tudor is largely unknown. Recent studies revealed that the transcriptional co-activator activity of Spindlin1 could be attenuated by SPIN*DOC. Here we solved the crystal structure of SPIN*DOC-Spindlin1 complex, revealing that a hydrophobic motif, DOCpep3 (256-281), of SPIN*DOC interacts with Tudor 3 of Spindlin1 and completes its {beta}-barrel fold. Massive hydrophobic contacts and hydrogen bonding interactions ensure a high affinity DOCpep3-Spindlin1 engagement with a binding Kd of 30 nM. Interestingly, we characterized two more K/R-rich motifs of SPIN*DOC, DOCpep1 (187-195) and DOCpep2 (228-239), which bind to Spindlin1 at lower affinities with Kd values of 78 M and 31 M, respectively. Structural and binding studies revealed that DOCpep1 and DOCpep2 competitively bind to the aromatic cage of Spindlin1 Tudor 2 that is responsible for H3K4me3 readout. Although DOCpep3-Spindlin1 engagement is compatible with histone readout, an extended SPIN*DOC fragment containing DOCpep1 and DOCpep2 inhibits histone or TCF4 binding by Spindin1 due to introduced competition. This inhibitory effect is more pronounced for weaker binding targets but not for strong ones such as H3 \"K4me3-K9me3\" bivalent mark. Our RT-qPCR experiment showed that the removal of the hydrophobic motif or the K/R-rich region compromised the inhibitory effects of SPIN*DOC on Spindlin1-mediated transcriptional activation. In sum, here we revealed multivalent engagement between SPIN*DOC and Spindlin1, in which a hydrophobic motif acts as the primary binding site for stable SPIN*DOC-Spindlin1 association, while two more neighboring K/R-rich motifs further modulate the target selectivity of Spindlin1 via competitive inhibition, therefore attenuating the transcriptional co-activator activities of Spindlin1 through affecting its chromatin association.",

    "abstract": "Tendon injuries are common and heal poorly, due in part to a lack of understanding of fundamental tendon cell biology. A major impediment to the study of tendon cells is the absence of robust, well-characterized in vitro models. Unlike other tissue systems, current tendon cell models do not account for how differences in isolation methodology may affect the activation state of tendon cells or the presence of various tendon cell sub-populations. The objective of this study was to characterize how common isolation methods affect the behavior, fate, and lineage composition of tendon cell cultures. Tendon cells isolated by explant exhibited reduced proliferative capacity, decreased expression of tendon marker genes, and increased expression of genes associated with fibroblast activation compared to digested cells. Consistently, explanted cells also displayed an increased propensity to differentiate to myofibroblasts compared to digested cells. Explanted cultures from multiple different tendons were substantially enriched for the presence of scleraxis-lineage (Scx-lin+) cells compared to digested cultures, while the overall percentage of S100a4-lineage (S100a4-lin+) cells was dependent on both isolation method and tendon of origin. Neither isolation method preserved the ratios of Scx-lin+ or S100a4-lin+ to non-lineage cells seen in tendons in vivo. Combined, these data indicate that further refinement of in vitro cultures models is required in order to more accurately understand the effects of various stimuli on tendon cell behavior.\n\nStatement of clinical significanceThe development of informed in vitro tendon cell models will facilitate enhanced screening of potential therapeutic candidates to improve tendon healing.",

    "abstract": "Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an important part of the nitrogen biogeochemical cycles and the main nitrogen source of the biosphere. As a classical model system for symbiotic nitrogen fixation, rhizobium-legume systems have been studied elaborately for decades. Detailed panorama about the molecular mechanism of the communication and coordination between rhizobia and host plants is becoming clearer. For more systematic insights, there is an increasing demand on new studies integrating multi-omics information. Here we present a comprehensive computational framework, integrating the reconstructed protein interactome of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 with its transcriptome and proteome data, to study the complex protein-protein interaction (PPI) network involved in the symbiosis system. We reconstructed the interactome of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 by computational approaches. Based on the comparison of interactomes between B. diazoefficiens USDA110 and other rhizobia, we inferred that the slow growth of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 may owe to the requirement of more protein modifications and further identified 36 conserved functional PPI modules. Integrated with transcriptome and proteome data, interactomes representing free-living cell and symbiotic nitrogen-fixing (SNF) bacteroid were obtained. Based on the SNF interactome, a core-sub-PPI-network for symbiotic nitrogen fixation was determined and 9 novel functional modules and 11 key protein hubs playing key roles for symbiosis were identified. The reconstructed interactome of B. diazoefficiens USDA110 may serve as a valuable reference for studying the mechanism underlying the SNF system of rhizobia and legumes.",

    "abstract": "Sigma factors are an important class of bacterial transcription factors that lend specificity to RNA polymerases by binding to distinct promoter elements for genes in their regulons. Here we show that activation of the general stress sigma factor, {sigma}B, in Bacillus subtilis paradoxically leads to dramatic induction of translation for a subset of its regulon genes. These genes are translationally repressed when transcribed by the housekeeping sigma factor, {sigma}A, owing to extended RNA secondary structures as determined in vivo using DMS-MaPseq. Transcription from {sigma}B-dependent promoters liberates the secondary structures and activates translation, leading to dual induction. Translation efficiencies between {sigma}B- and {sigma}A-dependent RNA isoforms can vary by up to 100-fold, which in multiple cases exceeds the magnitude of transcriptional induction. These results highlight the role of long-range RNA folding in modulating translation and demonstrate that a transcription factor can regulate protein synthesis beyond its effects on transcript levels.",

Fibers from synthetic clothes and fabrics are a major source of airborne microplastics, and their release from dryer machines is still poorly understood.\n\nObjectivesIn this study, we aimed to establish an in vitro organoid model of human lung epithelial cells to evaluate its suitability for studying the effects of airborne microplastic contamination on humans. Furthermore, we aimed to characterize the microplastic fibers (MPFs) released in the exhaust filter of a household dryer and to test their interactions and inflammatory effects on the established lung organoids.\n\nMethodsThe polyester fibers emitted from the drying of synthetic fabrics were collected. Morphological characterization of the fibers released into the air filter was performed by optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The organoids were exposed to various MPF concentrations (1, 10, and 50 mg L-1) and analyzed by optical microscopy, SEM, and confocal microscopy. Gene expression analysis of lung-specific genes, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress-related genes was achieved by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).\n\nResultsWe successfully cultured organoids with lung-specific genes. The presence of MPFs did not inhibit organoid growth, but polarized cell growth was observed along the fibers. Moreover, the MPFs did not cause inflammation or oxidative stress. Interestingly, the MPFs were coated with a cellular layer, resulting in the inclusion of fibers in the organoid.\n\nDiscussionThis work could have potential long-term implications regarding lung epithelial cells undergoing repair.

    "abstract": "Identifying the genetic foundations of trait variation and evolution is challenging as it is often difficult to parse meaningful signals from confounding signatures such as drift and epistasis. However, identification of the genetic loci underlying morphological and physiological traits can be honed through the use of comparative and complementary genetic approaches, whereby shared sets of genes that are repeatedly implicated across large evolutionary time periods as under selection can illuminate important pathways and epistatic relationships that function as novel regulators of trait development. Here we intersect comparative genomic analyses with unbiased mutagenesis screens in distantly related species to define the control of proportional growth, as changes in the size and relative proportions of tissues underlie a large degree of the variant forms seen in nature. Through a phylogenomic analysis of genome-wide variation in 35 species of flying fishes and relatives, we identify genetic signatures in both coding and regulatory regions underlying the convergent evolution of increased paired fin size and aerial gliding behaviors, key innovations for flying fishes and flying halfbeaks. To refine our analysis, we intersected convergent phylogenomic signatures with mutants identified in distantly related zebrafish with altered fin size. Through these paired approaches, we identify a surprising role for an L-type amino acid transporter, lat4a, and the potassium channel, kcnh2a, in the regulation of fin proportion. We show that specific epistatic interaction between these genetic loci in zebrafish closely phenocopies the observed fin proportions of flying fishes. The congruence of experimental and phylogenomic findings point to a conserved, non-canonical signaling interaction that integrates bioelectric cues and amino acid transport in the establishment of relative size in development and evolution.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has quickly become one of the most dominant techniques in modern transcriptome assessment. In particular, 10X Genomics Chromium system, with its high throughput approach, turn key and thorough user guide made this cutting-edge technique accessible to many laboratories using diverse animal models. However, standard pre-processing, including the alignment and cell filtering pipelines might not be ideal for every organism or tissue. Here we applied an alternative strategy, based on the pseudoaligner kallisto, on twenty-two publicly available single cell sequencing datasets from a wide range of tissues of eight organisms and compared the results with the standard 10X Genomics Cell Ranger pipeline.\n\nResultsIn most of the tested samples, kallisto produced higher sequencing read alignment rates and total gene detection rates in comparison to Cell Ranger. Although datasets processed with Cell Ranger had higher cell counts, outside of human and mouse datasets, these additional cells were routinely of low quality, containing low gene detection rates. Thorough downstream analysis of one kallisto processed dataset, obtained from the zebrafish pineal gland, revealed clearer clustering, allowing the identification of an additional photoreceptor cell type that previously went undetected. The finding of the new cluster suggests that the photoreceptive pineal gland is essentially a bi-chromatic tissue containing both green and red cone-like photoreceptors and implies that the alignment and pre-processing pipeline can affect the discovery of biologically-relevant cell types.\n\nConclusionWhile Cell Ranger favors higher cell numbers, using kallisto results in datasets with higher median gene detection per cell. We could demonstrate that cell type identification was not hampered by the lower cell count, but in fact improved as a result of the high gene detection rate and the more stringent filtering. Depending on the acquired dataset, it can be beneficial to favor high quality cells and accept a lower cell count, leading to an improved classification of cell types.",

    "abstract": "B-crystallin (ABC) is a human small heat shock protein that is strongly linked to Alzheimers disease (AD). In vitro, it can inhibit the aggregation and amyloid formation of a range of proteins including A{beta}(1-40), a primary component of AD amyloid plaques. Despite the strong links, the mechanism by which ABC inhibits amyloid formation has remained elusive, in part due to the notorious irreproducibility of aggregation assays involving preparations of A{beta}-peptides of native sequence. Here, we present a recombinant expression protocol to produce native A{beta}(1-40), devoid of any modifications or exogenous residues, with yields up to 4 mg/L E. coli. This material provides highly reproducible aggregation kinetics and, by varying the solution conditions, we obtain either highly ordered amyloid fibrils or more disordered aggregates. Addition of ABC slows the aggregation of A{beta}(1-40), and interferes specifically with the formation of ordered amyloid fibrils, favouring instead the more disordered aggregates. Solution-state NMR spectroscopy reveals that the interaction of ABC with A{beta}(1-40) depends on the specific aggregate morphology. These results provide mechanistic insight into how ABC inhibits the formation of amyloid fibrils.\n\nHighlightsO_LIProtocol for production of native recombinant A{beta}(1-40)\nC_LIO_LIAmyloid formation under physiological conditions is highly reproducible\nC_LIO_LIBoth ordered fibrils and disordered aggregates can be reliably formed\nC_LIO_LIB-crystallin specifically inhibits amyloid fibril assembling, favouring disordered aggregates\nC_LI\n\neTOC blurbMuller et al. introduce a protocol for the highly reproducible production of amyloid from native A{beta}(1-40) and determine that the human chaperone ABC specifically destabilises them in favour of disordered aggregates.

    "abstract": "Bicuspid Aortic Valves (BAVs) are a common congenital heart disease where two cusps of the aortic heart valve become fused together, this leads to two unequally sized leaflets compared to the normal trileaflet valve. Transcatheter Aortic Valves are currently used in off-label treatmet of stenosed BAVs, however, due to the abnormal valve anatomy, debate surrounds the sizing of transcatheter valves. In this study, finite element models were developed to simulate the deployment of two different valves sizes (a 25 mm and a 27 mm) of the Lotus valve into the patient-specific aortic root geometry of a clinical stenosed BAV case. These models were used to investigate and compare the eccentricity, stress and mal-apposition of the two valve sizes. The results demonstrated that the 25 mm valve was the most suitable in terms of eccentricity and stress reduction. It was also shown that the smaller 25 mm valve size did not increase the likelihood of mal-apposition. As the 25 mm valve was deemed suitable based on current sizing algorithms, on the basis of these results traditional annulus measurement and device sizing may be suitable in the case of the Lotus valve.",

    "abstract": "The healthy prostate is a relatively quiescent tissue. Yet, prostate epithelium overgrowth is a common condition during ageing, associated with urinary dysfunction and tumorigenesis. For over thirty years, TGF-{beta} ligands have been known to induce cytostasis in a large variety of epithelia, but the intracellular pathway mediating this signal in the prostate, as well as its relevance for quiescence, have remained elusive.\n\nHere, using mouse prostate organoids to model epithelial progenitors, we found that intra-epithelial non-canonical Activin A signalling inhibited cell proliferation in a Smad-independent manner. Mechanistically, Activin A triggered Tak1 and p38 MAPK activity, leading to p16 and p21 nuclear import. Spontaneous evasion from this quiescent state occurred upon prolonged culture, due to reduced Activin A secretion, a condition associated with DNA replication stress and aneuploidy. Organoids capable to escape quiescence in vitro were also able to implant with increased frequency into immunocompetent mice.\n\nOur study demonstrates that non-canonical Activin A signalling safeguards epithelial quiescence in the healthy prostate, with potential implications for the understanding of cancer initiation, and the development of therapies targeting quiescent tumour progenitors.",

Previous work has shown that its abundance is often increased in the context of tissue repair and fibrosis. The present study was designed to evaluate its potential as a biomarker of myocardial interstitial fibrosis (MIF), a well-established pathogenic pathway leading to heart failure.\n\n(2) Methods and ResultsCardiac fibrosis was induced in rats using an optimized model of chronic pressure overload triggered by angiotensin II and N{omega}-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). All treated animals suffered from heart hypertrophy and the increase in heart collagen volume fraction (CVF), evidenced by histology and 68Ga-Collagelin uptake, confirmed the development of cardiac fibrosis. Functional analysis by simultaneous PET-MRI further showed that our model closely reflected the pathological features seen in human MIF, including left ventricle thickening and diastolic dysfunction associated with decreased ejection fraction. PCPE-1 mRNA and protein levels were augmented by factors of 3.4 and 6.1 respectively in the heart tissue of treated rats. Moreover, protein abundance was well-correlated with CVF (r=0.92, p<0.0001) and PCPE-1 immuno-detection mainly localized the protein to fibrotic areas. Finally, PCPE-1 plasma levels measured by ELISA were increased in fibrotic rats compared to controls.\n\n(3) ConclusionTogether, our findings demonstrate that PCPE-1 levels in the heart and circulation tightly reflect the cardiac fibrosis status and heart function impairment in rats and suggest that it could be a very useful marker to monitor human heart diseases leading to fibrosis.",

    "abstract": "Signaling networks are at the heart of almost all biological processes. Most of these networks contain a large number of components and often the connections between these components are either not known, or the rate equations that govern the dynamics of soluble signaling components are not quantified. This uncertainty in network topology and parameters can make it challenging to formulate detailed mathematical models. Boolean networks, in which all components are either on or off, have emerged as viable alternatives to more detailed mathematical models but can be difficult to implement. Therefore, open source format of such models for community use is desirable. Here we present BoolSim, a freely available graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to easily construct and analyze Boolean networks. BoolSim can be applied to any Boolean network. We demonstrate BoolSims application using a previously published network for abscisic acid-driven stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. We also show how BoolSim can be used to generate testable predictions by extending the network to include CO2 regulation of stomatal movements. Predictions of the model were experimentally tested and the model was iteratively modified based on experiments showing that ABA closes stomata even at near zero CO2 concentrations (1.5 ppm CO2).\n\nOne Sentence SummaryThis study presents an open-source, graphical interface for the simulation of Boolean networks and applies it to an abscisic acid signaling network in guard cells, extended to include input from CO2.",

However, lack of suitable experimental models hinders understanding molecular mechanisms and cell-type-specific responses triggered by HSV-1. Here, we infected human brain organoids with HSV-1. Known features of HSV-1 infection such as alteration of neuronal electrophysiology and induction of antisense transcription were confirmed. Full-length mRNA-sequencing revealed aberrant 3 end formation and poly(A)-tail lengthening. Single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics uncovered changes in the cellular composition of the infected organoids caused by viral replication and dysregulation of molecular pathways in cell-type specific manner. Furthermore, hallmarks of early neurodegeneration were observed, namely extracellular matrix disruption, STMN2 and TARDBP/TDP43 downregulation, and upregulation of the AD-related non-coding RNA BC200/BCYRN1. These hallmarks were weaker/absent when infecting with a mutant HSV-1 control.

Current ex-vivo electrophysiological techniques are limited to recording a small set of neurons and cannot provide an inadequate resolution, which hinders revealing the fast dynamic underlying the information coding mechanisms in the OB circuit. Here, we demonstrate a novel biohybrid OB-CMOS platform to decipher the cross-scale dynamics of OB electrogenesis and quantify the distinct neuronal coding properties. The approach with 4096-microelectrodes offers a non-invasive, label-free, bioelectrical imaging to decode simultaneous firing patterns from thousands of connected neuronal ensembles in acute OB slices. The platform can measure spontaneous and drug-induced extracellular field potential activity. We employ our OB-CMOS recordings to perform multidimensional analysis to instantiate specific neurophysiological metrics underlying the olfactory spatiotemporal coding that emerged from the OB interconnected layers. Our results delineate the computational implications of large-scale activity patterns in functional olfactory processing. The high-content characterization of the olfactory circuit could benefit better functional interrogations of the olfactory spatiotemporal coding, connectivity mapping, and, further, the designing of reliable and advanced olfactory cell-based biosensors for diagnostic biomarkers and drug discovery.",

Here, we report that Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling at the luminal side of the brain microvasculature plays an integral role in the capillary stalling phenomenon of the APP/PS1 mouse model. Administration of the anti-mouse VEGF-A164 antibody, an isoform that inhibits blood brain barrier (BBB) hyperpermeability, reduced the number of stalled capillaries within an hour of injection, leading to an immediate increase in average capillary blood flow but not capillary diameter. VEGF-A inhibition also reduced the overall eNOS protein concentrations, increased occludin levels, and decreased the penetration of circulating Evans Blue dye across the BBB into the brain parenchyma, suggesting increased BBB integrity. Capillaries prone to neutrophil adhesion after anti-VEGF-A treatment also had lower occludin concentrations than flowing capillaries. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that VEGF-A signaling in APP/PS1 mice contributes to aberrant eNOS/occludin- associated BBB permeability, increases the incidence of capillary stalls, and leads to reductions in CBF. Reducing leucocyte adhesion by inhibiting luminal VEGF signaling may provide a novel and well-tolerated strategy for improving brain microvascular blood flow in AD patients.",

Deep brain stimulation of the PPN has been proposed as an emerging treatment for patients with Parkinsons disease (PD) or multiple system atrophy (MSA) suffering gait-related atypical parkinsonian syndromes.\n\nObjectiveIn this study, we investigated PPN activities during gait to better understand its functional role in locomotion. Specifically, we investigated whether PPN activity is rhythmically modulated during locomotion.\n\nMethodsPPN local field potential (LFP) activities were recorded from PD or MSA patients suffering from gait difficulties during stepping in place or free walking. Simultaneous measurements from force plates or accelerometers were used to determine the phase within each gait cycle at each time point.\n\nResultsOur results showed that activities in the alpha and beta frequency bands in the PPN LFPs were rhythmically modulated by the gait phase within gait cycles, with a higher modulation index when the stepping rhythm was more regular. Meanwhile, the PPN-cortical coherence was most prominent in the alpha band. Both gait-phase related modulation in the alpha/beta power and the PPN-cortical coherence in the alpha frequency band were spatially specific to the PPN and did not extend to surrounding regions.\n\nConclusionsThese results raise the possibility that alternating PPN stimulation in tandem with the gait rhythm may be more beneficial for gait control than continuous stimulation, although this remains to be established in future studies.",

Connectivity patterns as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) exist at multiple scales, with global networks of connectivity composed of microscale interactions between individual nodes. It remains unclear how separate dimensions of psychopathology might differentially impact these different scales of organization.\n\nMethodsPatients experiencing anxious misery symptomology (depression, anxiety and trauma; n = 192) were assessed for symptomology and received resting-state fMRI scans. Three modeling approaches (seed-based correlation analysis [SCA], support vector regression [SVR] and Brain Basis Set Modeling [BSS]), each relying on increasingly dense representations of functional connectivity patterns, were used to associate connectivity patterns with six different dimensions of psychopathology: anxiety sensitivity, anxious arousal, rumination, anhedonia, insomnia and negative affect. Importantly, a full 50 patients were held-out in a testing dataset, leaving 142 patients as training data.\n\nResultsDifferent symptom dimensions were best modeled by different scales of brain connectivity: anhedonia and anxiety sensitivity were best modeled with single connections (SCA), insomnia and anxious arousal by mesoscale patterns (SVR) and negative affect and ruminative thought by broad, cortex-spanning patterns (BBS). Dysfunction within the default mode network was implicated in all symptom dimensions that were best modeled by multivariate models.\n\nConclusionThese results suggest that symptom dimensions differ in the degree to which they impact different scales of brain organization. In addition to advancing our basic understanding of transdiagnostic psychopathology, this has implications for the translation of basic research paradigms to human disorders.",

    "abstract": "Neurons in human Alzheimers disease acquire phenotypes that are also present in various cancers, including over-stabilization of the cytoskeleton, nuclear pleomorphism, decondensation of constitutive heterochromatin, and aberrant activation of the cell cycle. Unlike in cancer, in which cell cycle activation drives tumor formation, activation of the cell cycle in post-mitotic neurons is sufficient to induce neuronal death. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that abortive cell cycle activation is a consequence of pathogenic forms of tau, a protein that drives neurodegeneration in Alzheimers disease and related \"tauopathies.\" We have combined network analysis of human Alzheimers disease and mouse tauopathy with mechanistic studies in Drosophila to discover that pathogenic forms of tau drive abortive cell cycle activation by disrupting the cellular program that maintains neuronal identity. Mechanistically, we identify Moesin, a prognostic biomarker for cancer and mediator of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), as a major effector of tau-induced neurotoxicity. We find that aberrant activation of Moesin in neurons acts through the actin cytoskeleton to dysregulate the cellular program that maintains neuronal identity.

    "abstract": "Increased interleukin (IL)-17A has been identified in joints affected by osteoarthritis (OA), but it is unclear how IL-17A, and its family members IL-17AF and IL-17F, can contribute to human OA pathophysiology. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the gene expression and signalling pathway activation effects of the different IL-17 family members in fibroblasts derived from cartilage and synovium of patients with end-stage knee OA. Immunohistochemistry staining confirmed that IL-17 receptors A (IL-17RA) and IL-17RC are expressed in end-stage OA-derived cartilage and synovium. Chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts derived from end-stage OA patients were treated with IL-17A, IL-17AF, or IL-17F, and gene expression was assessed with bulk RNA-Seq. Hallmark pathway analysis showed that IL-17 cytokines regulated several OA pathophysiology-related pathways including immune-, angiogenesis-, and complement-pathways in both chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts derived from end-stage OA patients. While overall IL-17A induced the strongest transcriptional response, followed by IL-17AF and IL-17F, not all genes followed this pattern. Disease-Gene Network analysis revealed that IL-17A-related changes in gene expression in these cells are associated with experimental arthritis, knee arthritis, and musculoskeletal disease gene-sets. Western blot analysis confirmed that IL-17A significantly activates p38 and p65 NF-{kappa}B. Incubation of chondrocytes and synovial fibroblasts with IL-17A antibody secukinumab significantly inhibited IL-17A-induced gene expression. In conclusion, the association of IL-17-induced transcriptional changes with arthritic gene-sets supports a role for IL-17A in OA pathophysiology. Therefore, secukinumab could be investigated as a potential therapeutic option in OA patients.",

    "abstract": "T cells play an important role in adaptive immunity. An enormous clonal diversity of T-cells with a different specificity, encoded by the T-cell receptor (TCR), protect the body against infection. Most TCR{beta} chains are generated from a V-, D-, and J-segment during recombination in the thymus. Although complete absence of the D-segment is not easily detectable from sequencing data, we find convincing evidence for a substantial proportion of TCR{beta} rearrangements lacking a D-segment. Additionally, sequences without a D-segment are more likely to be abundant within individuals and/or shared between individuals. We find that such sequences are preferentially generated during fetal development and persist within the elderly. Summarizing, TCR{beta} rearrangements without a D-segment are not uncommon, and tend to allow for TCR{beta} chains with a high abundance in the naive repertoire.",

    "abstract": "Northern hardwood forests in formerly glaciated areas had been free of earthworms until exotic European earthworms were introduced by human activities. The invasion of exotic earthworms is known to dramatically alter soil physical, geochemical, and biological properties, but its impacts on soil microbiomes are still unclear. Here we show that the invasive earthworms alter soil microbiomes and ecosystem functioning, especially for nitrogen cycling. We collected soil samples at different depths from three sites across an active earthworm invasion chronosequence in a hardwood forest in Minnesota, USA. We analyzed the structures and the functional potentials of the soil microbiomes by using amplicon sequencing, high-throughput nitrogen cycle gene quantification (NiCE chip), and shotgun metagenomics. Both the levels of earthworm invasion and soil depth influenced the microbiome structures. In the most recently and minimally invaded soils, Nitrososphaera and Nitrospira as well as the genes related to nitrification were more abundant than in the heavily invaded soils. By contrast, genes related to denitrification and nitrogen fixation were more abundant in the heavily invaded than the minimally invaded soils. Our results suggest that the N cycling in forest soils is mostly nitrification driven before earthworm invasion, whereas it becomes denitrification driven after earthworm invasion.",

How REST/NRSF regulates gene expression remains incompletely understood. Here, we investigate the binding pattern and regulation mechanism of REST/NRSF in the clustered protocadherin (PCDH) genes. We find that REST/NRSF directionally forms base-specific interactions with NRSEs via tandem ZFs in an anti-parallel manner but with striking conformational changes. In addition, REST/NRSF recruitment to the HS5-1 enhancer leads to the decrease of long-range enhancer-promoter interactions and downregulation of the clustered PCDH genes. Thus, REST/NRSF represses PCDH gene expression through directional binding to a repertoire of NRSEs within the distal enhancer and variable target genes.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian nephrons originate from a population of nephron progenitor cells (NPCs), and it is known that NPCs transcriptomes change throughout nephrogenesis during healthy kidney development. To characterize chromatin accessibility and microRNA (miRNA) expression throughout this process, we collected NPCs from mouse kidneys at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5) and postnatal day zero (P0) and assayed cells for transposase-accessible chromatin and small RNA expression. We observe 46,374 genomic regions of accessible chromatin, with 2,103 showing significant changes in accessibility between E14.5 and P0. In addition, we detect 1,104 known microRNAs, with 114 showing significant changes in expression. Genome-wide, changes in DNA accessibility and microRNA expression highlight biological processes like cellular differentiation, cell migration, extracellular matrix interactions, and developmental signaling pathways such as Notch. Furthermore, our data identify novel candidate cis-regulatory elements for Eya1 and Pax8, both genes with a role in NPC differentiation; we also associate expression-changing microRNAs, including let-7-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-181a-2-3p, and miR-9-3p, with candidate cis-regulatory elements. Overall, our data characterize NPCs during kidney development and point out new candidate regulatory elements for genes and microRNA with key roles in nephrogenesis.",

    "abstract": "The growth of imaginal discs in holometabolous insects is coordinated with larval growth to ensure the symmetrical and proportional development of the adult appendages. In ants, the differential growth of these discs generates distinct castes - the winged male and queen castes and the wingless worker caste. In the hyperdiverse ant genus Pheidole, the worker caste is composed of two morphologically distinct subcastes: small minor workers and larger, big-headed soldiers. Although these worker subcastes are completely wingless, soldier larvae develop rudimentary forewing discs that are necessary for generating the disproportionate head-to-body scaling of the big-headed soldier subcaste. However, it remains unclear whether rudimentary forewing discs in soldier larvae are coordinated with other imaginal discs, and whether disc growth and coordination patterns vary between the minor worker and soldier subcastes. Here we show, using quantitative nano-CT three-dimensional analyses, that growth of the soldier rudimentary forewing discs is coordinated with the increase in volume of the leg and eye-antennal (head) discs as well as with larval size. We found that the growth rate of the rudimentary forewing discs differs from the leg discs but is similar to the growth of the head (eye-antennal) discs relative to larval size, suggesting that growth of each type of imaginal disc may be differentially regulated. In addition to their larger size, the soldier eye-antennal discs increase in width as they undergo morphogenesis to generate the characteristic shape of the large soldier head, suggesting that the rudimentary forewing discs may regulate their patterning in addition to their growth. Finally, we observe little growth of the leg and eye-antennal discs during the bipotential stage, while in minor worker development these discs grow at similar rates to one another in coordination with larval size to generate the smaller minor worker subcaste. Our results suggest that rudimentary organs with regulatory functions may participate in new patterns of inter-organ coordination and regulation to produce novel phenotypes and complex worker caste systems. We provide characterization of larval development and imaginal disc growth and morphogenesis with the aim of highlighting this as an emerging system for the study of rudimentary organs during development and evolution.",

    "abstract": "Family and population studies indicate clear heritability of major depressive disorder (MDD), though its underlying biology remains unclear. The majority of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) linkage blocks associated with MDD by genome-wide association studies (GWASes) are believed to alter transcriptional regulators (e.g., enhancers, promoters), based on enrichment of marks correlated with these functions. A key to understanding MDD pathophysiology will be elucidation of which SNPs are functional and how such functional variants biologically converge to elicit the disease. Furthermore, retinoids can elicit MDD in patients, and promote depressive behaviors in rodent models, acting via a regulatory system of retinoid receptor transcription factors (TFs). We therefore sought to simultaneously identify functional genetic variants and assess retinoid pathway regulation of MDD risk loci. Using Massively Parallel Reporter Assays (MPRAs), we functionally screened over 1 000 SNPs prioritized from 39 neuropsychiatric trait/disease GWAS loci, with SNPs selected based on overlap with predicted regulatory features--including expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and histone marks--from human brains and cell cultures. We identified >100 SNPs with allelic effects on expression in a retinoid-responsive model system. Further, functional SNPs were enriched for binding sequences of retinoic acid-receptive transcription factors (TFs); with additional allelic differences unmasked by treatment with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Finally, motifs overrepresented across functional SNPs corresponded to TFs highly specific to serotonergic neurons, suggesting an in vivo site of action. Our application of MPRAs to screen MDD-associated SNPs suggests a shared transcriptional regulatory program across loci, a subset of which are unmasked by retinoids.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPersonalized medicine promises individualized disease prediction and treatment. The convergence of machine learning (ML) and available multi-modal data is key moving forward. We build upon previous work to deliver multi-modal predictions of Parkinsons Disease (PD).\n\nMethodsWe performed automated ML on multi-modal data from the Parkinsons Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI). After selecting the best performing algorithm, all PPMI data was used to tune the selected model. The model was validated in the Parkinsons Disease Biomarker Program (PDBP) dataset. Finally, networks were built to identify gene communities specific to PD.\n\nFindingsOur initial model showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 89.72% for the diagnosis of PD. The tuned model was then tested for validation on external data (PDBP, AUC 85.03%). Optimizing thresholds for classification, increased the diagnosis prediction accuracy (balanced accuracy) and other metrics. Combining data modalities outperforms the single biomarker paradigm. UPSIT was the largest contributing predictor for the classification of PD. The transcriptomic data was used to construct a network of disease-relevant transcripts.\n\nInterpretationWe have built a model using an automated ML pipeline to make improved multi-omic predictions of PD. The model developed improves disease risk prediction, a critical step for better assessment of PD risk. We constructed gene expression networks for the next generation of genomics-derived interventions. Our automated ML approach allows complex predictive models to be reproducible and accessible to the community.\n\nFundingNational Institute on Aging, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and the Global Parkinsons Genetics Program.\n\nRESEARCH IN CONTEXTO_ST_ABSEvidence before this studyC_ST_ABSPrior research into predictors of Parkinsons disease (PD) has either used basic statistical methods to make predictions across data modalities, or they have focused on a single data type or biomarker model. We have done this using an open-source automated machine learning (ML) framework on extensive multi-modal data, which we believe yields robust and reproducible results. We consider this the first true multi-modality ML study of PD risk classification.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe used a variety of linear, non-linear, kernel, neural networks, and ensemble ML algorithms to generate an accurate classification of both cases and controls in independent datasets using data that is not involved in PD diagnosis itself at study recruitment. The model built in this paper significantly improves upon our previous models that used the entire training dataset in previous work1. Building on this earlier work, we showed that the PD diagnosis can be refined using improved algorithmic classification tools that may yield potential biological insights. We have taken careful consideration to develop and validate this model using public controlled-access datasets and an open-source ML framework to allow for reproducible and transparent results.\n\nImplications of all available evidenceTraining, validating, and tuning a diagnostic algorithm for PD will allow us to augment clinical diagnoses or risk assessments with less need for complex and expensive exams. Going forward, these models can be built on remote or asynchronously collected data which may be important in a growing telemedicine paradigm. More refined diagnostics will also increase clinical trial efficiency by potentially refining phenotyping and predicting onset, allowing providers to identify potential cases earlier. Early detection could lead to improved treatment response and higher efficacy. Finally, as part of our workflow, we built new networks representing communities of genes correlated in PD cases in a hypothesis-free manner, showing how new and existing genes may be connected and highlighting therapeutic opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum and hybrids) is a specialty crop, with expanding production and consumption worldwide. The blueberry breeding program at the University of Florida (UF) has greatly contributed to the expansion of production areas by developing low-chilling cultivars better adapted to subtropical and Mediterranean climates of the globe. The breeding program has historically focused on phenotypic recurrent selection. As an autopolyploid, outcrossing, perennial, long juvenile phase crop, blueberrys breeding cycles are costly and time-consuming, which results in low genetic gains per unit of time. Motivated by the application of molecular markers for a more accurate selection in early stages of breeding, we performed pioneering genomic prediction studies and optimization for implementation in the blueberry breeding program. We have also addressed some complexities of sequence-based geno- typing and model parametrization for an autopolyploid crop, providing empirical contributions that can be extended to other polyploid species. We herein revisited some of our previous genomic prediction studies and described the current achievements in the crop. In this paper, our contribution for genomic prediction in an autotetraploid crop is three-fold: i) summarize previous results on the relevance of model parametrizations, such as diploid or polyploid methods, and inclusion of dominance effects; ii) assess the importance of sequence depth of coverage and genotype dosage calling steps; iii) demonstrate the real impact of genomic selection on leveraging breeding decisions by using an independent validation set. Altogether, we propose a strategy for the use of genomic selection in blueberry, with potential to be applied to other polyploid species of a similar background.",

    "abstract": "Embryogenesis, transforming the zygote into the mature embryo, represents a fundamental process for all flowering plants. Current knowledge of cell specification and differentiation during plant embryogenesis is largely based on studies of the dicot model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the major crops are monocots and the transcriptional programs associated with the differentiation processes during embryogenesis in this clade were largely unknown. Here, we combined analysis of cell division patterns with development of a temporal transcriptomic resource during embryogenesis of the monocot model plant Brachypodium distachyon. We found that early divisions of the Brachypodium embryo were highly regular, while later stages were marked by less stereotypic patterns. Comparative transcriptomic analysis between Brachypodium and Arabidopsis revealed that the early and late embryogenesis shared a common transcriptional program, whereas mid-embryogenesis was divergent between species. Analysis of orthology groups revealed widespread heterochronic expression of potential developmental regulators between the species. Interestingly, Brachypodium genes tend to be expressed at earlier stages than Arabidopsis counterparts, which suggests that embryo patterning may occur early during Brachypodium embryogenesis. Detailed investigation of auxin-related genes shows that the capacity to synthesize, transport, and respond to auxin is established early in the embryo. However, while early PIN1 polarity could be confirmed, it is unclear if an active response is mounted. This study presents a resource for studying Brachypodium and grass embryogenesis, and shows that divergent angiosperms share a conserved genetic program that is marked by heterochronic gene expression.\n\nKey messageDevelopmental and transcriptomic analysis of Brachypodium embryogenesis, and comparison with Arabidopsis, identifies conserved and divergent phases of embryogenesis, and reveals widespread heterochrony of developmental gene expression.",

    "abstract": "The gregarious parasitoid strategy allows multiple larvae to complete development in a single host due to their tolerance and/or lower mobility and thus flexibly adjust their reproductive potential amidst changing environmental conditions. Reproductive success is generally measured as the number of each mothers offspring. We propose that with scarcity of host, for gregarious parasitoids is important the view on the fertility not only of a mother but also of her offspring (F1 generation). Due to the body size-fitness correlation, each female deliberately adjusts the clutch size, determining the offspring body size and their reproductive potential. In our study, using Anaphes flavipes as a model species, we showed that under a limited number of hosts, the females reduced their fertility. We propose that the lower fertility of mothers can cause higher fertility in the F2 generation using a larger offspring body while halving fertility. The females increase their individual offsprings fertility by reducing their own fertility. Moreover, we showed that with a scarcity of hosts, the mothers increased the number of their female offspring, and thus, they obtained more offspring in the F2 generation. Additionally, other costs and benefits of the gregarious strategy in relation to superparasitism were tested and discussed.",

    "abstract": "Estimates from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent a combination of the effect of inherited genetic variation (direct effects), demography (population stratification, assortative mating) and genetic nurture from relatives (indirect genetic effects). GWAS using family-based designs can control for demography and indirect genetic effects, but large-scale family datasets have been lacking. We combined data on 159,701 siblings from 17 cohorts to generate population (between-family) and within-sibship (within-family) estimates of genome-wide genetic associations for 25 phenotypes. We demonstrate that existing GWAS associations for height, educational attainment, smoking, depressive symptoms, age at first birth and cognitive ability overestimate direct effects. We show that estimates of SNP-heritability, genetic correlations and Mendelian randomization involving these phenotypes substantially differ when calculated using within-sibship estimates. For example, genetic correlations between educational attainment and height largely disappear. In contrast, analyses of most clinical phenotypes (e.g. LDL-cholesterol) were generally consistent between population and within-sibship models. We also report compelling evidence of polygenic adaptation on taller human height using within-sibship data. Large-scale family datasets provide new opportunities to quantify direct effects of genetic variation on human traits and diseases.",

    "abstract": "The Brodmann area (BA)-based map is one of the most widely used cortical maps for studies of human brain functions and in clinical practice; however, the molecular architecture of BAs remain unknown. The present study provided a global multiregional proteomic map of the human cerebral cortex by analyzing 29 BAs. These 29 BAs were grouped into 6 clusters based on similarities in proteomic patterns: the motor and sensory cluster, vision cluster, auditory cluster and Brocas area, Wernickes area cluster, cingulate cortex cluster, and heterogeneous function cluster. We identified 474 cluster-specific and 134 BA-specific signature proteins whose functions are closely associated with specialized functions and disease vulnerability of the corresponding cluster or BA. The findings of the present study could provide explanations for the functional connections between the anterior cingulate cortex and sensorimotor cortex and for anxiety-related function in the sensorimotor cortex. The brain transcriptomic and proteomic comparison indicated that they both could reflect the function of cerebral cortex, but showed different characteristics. These proteomic data are publicly available at the Human Brain Proteome Atlas (www.brain-omics.com). Our results may enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of brain functions and provide an important resource to support human brain research.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundExperimental proof of gene function assignments in plants is based on mutant analyses. T-DNA insertion lines provided an invaluable resource of mutants and enabled systematic reverse genetics-based investigation of the functions of Arabidopsis thaliana genes during the last decades.\n\nResultsWe sequenced the genomes of 14 A. thaliana GABI-Kat T-DNA insertion lines, which eluded flanking sequence tag-based attempts to characterize their insertion loci, with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long reads. Complex T-DNA insertions were resolved and 11 previously unknown T-DNA loci identified, resulting in about 2 T-DNA insertions per line and suggesting that this number was previously underestimated. T-DNA mutagenesis caused fusions of chromosomes along with compensating translocations to keep the gene set complete throughout meiosis. Also, an inverted duplication of 800 kbp was detected. About 10% of GABI-Kat lines might be affected by chromosomal rearrangements, some of which do not involve T-DNA. Local assembly of selected reads was shown to be a computationally effective method to resolve the structure of T-DNA insertion loci. We developed an automated workflow to support investigation of long read data from T-DNA insertion lines. All steps from DNA extraction to assembly of T-DNA loci can be completed within days.\n\nConclusionLong read sequencing was demonstrated to be an effective way to resolve complex T-DNA insertions and chromosome fusions. Many T-DNA insertions comprise not just a single T-DNA, but complex arrays of multiple T-DNAs. It is becoming obvious that T-DNA insertion alleles must be characterized by exact identification of both T-DNA::genome junctions to generate clear genotype-to-phenotype relations.",

    "abstract": "Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen that causes a wide range of infections. Neutrophils are an essential component of our innate immune system and understanding S. aureus-neutrophil interactions on a sub-cellular level is crucial to developing new therapeutic strategies to promote immunity during S. aureus infections. To this end we have developed a multi-modal imaging platform capable of following host-pathogen processes in biological systems, this is achieved by switching imaging modalities between a low photo-toxicity and low resolution imaging modality through an increasing illumination intensity to achieve live super-resolution imaging. This novel imaging platform was applied to the study of human neutrophils infected by S. aureus. We show that we can image different infection stages of S. aureus in live neutrophils with super resolution microscopy. We see evidence of binary fission occurring in intracellular S. aureus within a neutrophil.",

    "abstract": "The cystine/glutamate antiporter (xCT) is a crucial transporter that maintains cellular redox balance by regulating intracellular glutathione synthesis via cystine uptake. However, no robust and simple method to determine the cystine uptake activity of xCT is currently available. We have developed a method to measure the xCT activity via the reaction of selenocysteine and fluorescein O,O'-diacrylate (FOdA). Selenocystine, a cystine analog, is transported into cells through xCT on the cell membrane. The amount of the transported selenocystine was then determined by a reaction using tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and FOdA in a weak acidic buffer at pH 6. Using this method, the cystine uptake activity of xCT in various cells, and the inhibitory efficiency of xCT inhibitors, were evaluated.",

    "abstract": "The selection of informative markers has been studied massively as an alternative to reduce genotyping costs for the genomic selection (GS) application. Low-density marker panels are attractive for GS because they decrease computational time-consuming and multicollinearity beyond more individuals can be genotyped with the same cost. Nevertheless, these inferences are usually made empirically using \"static\" training sets and populations, which are adequate only to predict a breeding programs initial cycles but might not for long-term cycles. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, none of these inferences considered the inclusion of dominance into the GS models, which is particularly important to predict cross-pollinated crops. Therefore, that reveals an important and unexplored topic for allogamous long-term breeding. To achieve this goal, we employed two approaches: the former used empirical maize datasets, and the latter simulations of long-term breeding cycles of phenotypic and genomic recurrent selection (intrapopulation and reciprocal). Then, we observed the reducing marker density effect on populations (mean, the best genotypes performance, accuracy, additive variance) over cycles and models (additive, additive-dominance, specific combining ability (SCA)). Our results indicate that the markers reduction based on different linkage disequili brium (LD) levels is viable only within a cycle and brings a significant decrease in predictive ability over generations. Furthermore, in the long-term, regardless of the selection scheme adopted, the more makers, the better because they buffer LD losses caused by recombination over breeding cycles. Finally, regarding the accuracy, the additive-dominant models tend to outperform the additive ones and perform similar to the SCA.",

Definitive molecular features of this plasticity have largely remained elusive due to the limited scale of most studies. Leveraging scRNA-seq data from 160 tumours spanning 8 different cancer types, we identify expression patterns associated with intratumoural EMP. Integrative analysis of these programs confirmed a high degree of diversity among tumours. These diverse programs are associated with combinations of various common regulatory mechanisms initiated from cues within the tumour microenvironment. We highlight that inferring regulatory features can inform effective therapeutics to restrict EMP.",
