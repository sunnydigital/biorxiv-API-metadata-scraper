    "abstract": "This work identifies a novel role for the acetyltransferase GCN5 in regulating muscle integrity through inhibition of DNA binding activity of the transcriptional repressor YY1. Here we report that in mice a muscle-specific knockout of GCN5 (Gcn5skm-/-) reduces the expression of key structural muscle proteins, including dystrophin, resulting in myopathy. Supporting our observation, a meta-analysis between the differential transcriptome of Gcn5skm-/- muscle and all available open-access data sets identified top correlations with musculoskeletal diseases in humans. GCN5 was found to acetylate YY1 at two residues (K392 and K393), which disrupts the interaction between the YY1 zinc-finger region and DNA. De/acetylation mimics for these YY1 post-translational modifications modulated muscle structural gene expression and DNA binding. Analysis of human GTEx data also found positive and negative correlations between fiber diameter and GCN5 and YY1 respectively. Collectively, our results demonstrate that GCN5 acetyltransferase activity regulates YY1 DNA binding and expression of dystrophin to modulate muscle integrity.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWTrichogramma are parasitic microwasps much used as biological control agents. The genus is known to harbor tremendous diversity, at both inter- and intra-specific levels. The successful selection of Trichogramma strains for biocontrol depends on characterizing the existing diversity in this group, especially regarding oviposition performance and behavior. Oviposition preferences in relation to environmental cues such as light and gravity have received little attention so far, although they are suspected to play an important role in microhabitat selection and parasitism patterns. The extent of their variability, and their potential correlated variations, is virtually unknown. Here we use a novel experimental approach relying on automatic image analysis to characterize the oviposition preferences in relation to light and gravity, as well as their interaction, in 25 populations of Trichogramma from five species. We show that most Trichogramma populations and species harbour preferences for light and preferences for elevated parts. However, the two traits harbor significant inter and intraspecific variation. The effects of light and gravity on oviposition patterns were found to be almost perfectly additive overall, with two exceptions. Oviposition preference patterns were not static but very plastic in time: preferences tended to relax over consecutive days, and the strongest preferences relaxed the fastest, presumably because of the density-dependent effect of resource depletion. A correlation of oviposition patterns with the vegetation stratum at which populations were sampled suggests that different species/populations may be associated with different strata with corresponding differentiation in light- and gravity-related oviposition preferences.\n\nThis article has been peer-reviewed and recommended by Peer Community in Zoology doi: https://doi.org/10.24072/pci.zool.100008",

    "abstract": "Divergent ecological selection may diversify conspecific populations evolving into different niches, and may lead to speciation if gene flow is ceased, e.g, due to reinforcement leading to character displacement. Adaptation to the same niche is expected to be parallel. Whether selection against maladaptive hybridization in secondary sympatry also results in parallel divergence in traits that are not directly related to the ecological niches remains an empirical challenge, although such character displacement can be decisive for if ecotypes develop into new species. Here, we use a host shift in the phytophagous peacock fly Tephritis conura, with both host races represented in two geographically separate areas East and West of the Baltic Sea to investigate convergence in morphological adaptations. We asked i) if there are consistent morphological adaptations to a host plant shift and ii) if the response to secondary sympatry with the alternate host race is parallel across contact zones. We found surprisingly low and variable, albeit significant, divergence between host races. Only one trait, the length of the female ovipositor, which serves an important function in the interaction with the hosts, was consistently different. Instead, co-existence with the other host race significantly affected the degree of morphological divergence, but the divergence was largely driven by different traits in different contact zones. Thus, local stochastic fixation or reinforcement could generate trait divergence, and additional evidence is needed to conclude whether divergence is locally adaptive.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has had a major impact on the clinical management of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, clinical responses to ICB are observed in only a fraction of patients. In the present paper, we used multimodal approaches to a) evaluate the utility of existing ICB biomarkers including tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), and a T-cell specific signature in predicting therapy response in HNSCC using TCGA cohort, and; b) identify a novel molecular signature to predict ICB therapy response using an ICB clinical trial of HNSCC. Our results confirm previous reports showing TMB efficacy as a biomarker and its outcome can be influenced by age, tumor sub-site, and smoking status; and that High-TMB and high-MSI tumors are associated with T-cell signature, and better survival probability in the HNSCC. We go on to demonstrate that High-TMB and high-MSI utilizes cell-cycle/cell proliferation processes for their molecular functionality; and identify a novel Cell Proliferation ICB-therapy Predicting (CPIP) signature capable of predicting ICB therapy response in HNSCC, retrospectively, where traditional biomarkers of ICB response were insufficient. In summary, the present study defines strategies and novel signatures that can be appropriately used for patient selection for ICB therapy that can improve the clinical outcomes of HNSCC patients.",

    "abstract": "A tail of conspicuous coloration is hypothesized to be an advantageous trait for many species of lizards. Predator attacks would be directed to a non-vital, and autotomizable, body part, increasing the chance of survival. However, as body size increases it also increases the signaling area that could attract predators from greater distances, increasing the overall chance of predation. Here, we test the hypothesis that there is a trade-off between tail color and size, affecting predation probabilities. We used plasticine replicas of lizards to study the predation patterns of small and large lizards with red and blue tails. In a natural environment, we exposed six hundred replicas subjected to the attack of free-ranging predators. Large red-tailed models were attacked more quickly, and more intensely, by birds. Mammals and unidentified predators showed no preference for any size or colors. The attacks were not primarily directed to conspicuous tails when compared to the body or the head of our replicas. Our study suggests that red color signals in large lizards could enhance their detection by visually oriented predators (i.e., birds). The efficacy of conspicuous tails as a decoy may rely on associated behavioral displays, which are hard to test with static replicas.\n\nHighlightsO_LIThe roles of blue and red tails as decoys were not corroborated.\nC_LIO_LITail color and size interact while influencing predation rates.\nC_LIO_LILarger red-tailed lizards are more prone to be attacked by birds.\nC_LIO_LIThe benefit of having conspicuous tails appears to decrease as body size increases.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cells rapidly lose their physiological phenotype upon disruption of their extracellular matrix (ECM)-intracellular cytoskeleton interactions. Here, we investigated acute effects of ECM disruption on cellular and mitochondrial morphology, transcriptomic signatures, and Ca2+ handling in adult mouse skeletal muscle fibers. Adult skeletal muscle fibers were isolated from mouse toe muscle either by collagenase-induced dissociation of the ECM or by mechanical dissection that leaves the contiguous ECM intact. Experiments were generally performed four hours after cell isolation. At this time, there were striking differences in the gene expression patterns between fibers isolated with the two methods; 24h after cell isolation, enzymatically dissociated fibers had transcriptomic signatures resembling dystrophic phenotypes. Mitochondrial appearance was grossly similar in the two groups, but 3D electron microscopy revealed shorter and less branched mitochondria in enzymatically dissociated than in mechanically dissected fibers. Similar increases in free cytosolic [Ca2+] during repeated tetanic stimulation were accompanied by marked mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake only in enzymatically dissociated muscle fibers. The aberrant mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake was partially prevented by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter inhibitor Ru360 and by cyclosporine A and NV556, which inhibit the mitochondrial protein Ppif (also called cyclophilin D). Importantly, inhibition of Ppif with NV556 significantly improved survival of mice with mitochondrial myopathy in which muscle mitochondria take up excessive amounts of Ca2+ even with an intact ECM. In conclusion, skeletal muscle fibers isolated by collagenase-induced dissociation of the ECM display aberrant mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, which involves a Ppif-dependent mitochondrial Ca2+ influx resembling that observed in mitochondrial myopathies.",

    "abstract": "Maize (Zea mays L.) is a multi-purpose row crop grown worldwide, which overtime has often been bred for increased yield at the detriment of lower composition grain quality. Some knowledge of the genetic factors that affect quality traits has been discovered through the study of classical maize mutants. However, much of the underlying genetic architecture controlling these traits and the interaction between these traits remains unknown. To better understand variation that exists for grain compositional traits in maize, we evaluated 501 diverse temperate maize inbred lines in five unique environments and predicted 16 compositional traits (e.g. carbohydrates, protein, starch) based on the output of near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Phenotypic analysis found substantial variation for compositional traits and the majority of variation was explained by genetic and environmental factors. Correlations and trade-offs among traits in different maize types (e.g. dent, sweetcorn, popcorn) were explored and significant differences and correlations were detected. In total, 22.9-71.1% of the phenotypic variation across these traits could be explained using 2,386,666 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers generated from whole genome resequencing data. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using these same markers and found 70 statistically significant loci for 12 compositional traits.

    "abstract": "Cortical pyramidal cells (PCs) have a specialized dendritic mechanism for the generation of bursts, suggesting that these events play a special role in cortical information processing. In vivo, bursts occur at a low, but consistent rate. Theory suggests that this network state increases the amount of information they convey. However, because burst activity relies on a threshold mechanism, it is rather sensitive to dendritic input levels. In spiking network models, network states in which bursts occur rarely are therefore typically not robust, but require fine-tuning. Here, we show that this issue can be solved by a homeostatic inhibitory plasticity rule in dendrite-targeting interneurons that is consistent with experimental data. The suggested learning rule can be combined with other forms of inhibitory plasticity to self-organize a network state in which both spikes and bursts occur asynchronously and irregularly at low rate. Finally, we show that this network state creates the network conditions for a recently suggested multiplexed code and thereby indeed increases the amount of information encoded in bursts.\n\nAuthor summaryThe language of the brain consists of sequences of action potentials. These sequences often contain bursts, short \"words\" consisting of a few action potentials in rapid succession. Bursts appear to play a special role in the brain. They indicate whether a stimulus was perceived or missed, and they are very effective drivers of synaptic plasticity, the neural substrate of learning. Bursts occur rarely, but consistently, a condition that is thought to maximize the amount of information they can communicate. In our article, we argue that this condition is far from self-evident, but requires very special circumstances. We show that these circumstances can be reached by homeostatic inhibitory plasticity in certain inhibitory neuron types. This may sound complicated, but basically works just like a thermostat. When bursts occur too often, inhibition goes up and suppresses them. When they are too rare, inhibition goes down and thereby increases their number. In computer simulations, we show that this simple mechanism can create circumstances akin to those in the brain, and indeed allows bursts to convey information effectively. Whether this mechanism is indeed used by the brain now remains to be tested by our experimental colleagues.",

Recent studies have shown that the function of IncRNAS are largely mediated by their structures.

Non-coding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD) is an atypical IncRNA due to its abundant expression and high sequence conservation. NORAD regulates genomic stability by interacting with proteins and microRNAs. Previous sequence-based characterization has identified a modular organization of NORAD composed of several NORAD repeat units (NRUs). These units comprise the protein-binding elements and are separated by regular spacers of unknown function. Here, we experimentally determine for the first time the secondary structure of NORAD using the nextPARS approach. Our results suggest that the spacer regions provide structural stability to NRUs. Furthermore, we uncover two previously-unreported NRUs, and determine the core structural motifs conserved across NRUs.

    "abstract": "BackgroundEstimation of the accuracy (quality) of protein structural models is important for both prediction and use of protein structural models. Deep learning methods have been used to integrate protein structure features to predict the quality of protein models. Inter-residue distances are key information for predicting proteins tertiary structures and therefore have good potentials to predict the quality of protein structural models. However, few methods have been developed to fully take advantage of predicted inter-residue distance maps to estimate the accuracy of a single protein structural model.\n\nResultWe developed an attentive 2D convolutional neural network (CNN) with channel-wise attention to take only a raw difference map between the inter-residue distance map calculated from a single protein model and the distance map predicted from the protein sequence as input to predict the quality of the model. The network comprises multiple convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, dense layers, and Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks with attention to automatically extract features relevant to protein model quality from the raw input without using any expert-curated features. We evaluated DISTEMAs capability of selecting the best models for CASP13 targets in terms of ranking loss of GDT-TS score. The ranking loss of DISTEMA is 0.079, lower than several state-of-the-art single-model quality assessment methods. The work demonstrates that using raw inter-residue distance information alone with deep learning can predict the quality of protein structural models reasonably well.",

These components may be subject to methodological or other challenges over time. While reference to archived software and/or data is increasingly common in publications, a single machine-interpretable, integrative representation of how results were derived, that supports defeasible reasoning, has been absent.\n\nMethodsWe developed the Evidence Graph Ontology, EVI, in OWL 2, with a set of inference rules, to provide deep representations of supporting and challenging evidence for computations, services, software, data, and results, across arbitrarily deep networks of computations, in connected or fully distinct processes. EVI integrates FAIR practices on data and software, with important concepts from provenance models, and argumentation theory. It extends PROV for additional expressiveness, with support for defeasible reasoning. EVI treats any computational result or component of evidence as a defeasible assertion, supported by a DAG of the computations, software, data, and agents that produced it.\n\nResultsWe have successfully deployed EVI for large-scale predictive analytics on clinical time-series data. Every result may reference its evidence graph as metadata, which can be extended when subsequent computations are executed.\n\nDiscussionEvidence graphs support transparency and defeasible reasoning on results. They are first-class computational objects and reference the datasets and software from which they are derived. They support fully transparent computation, with challenge and support propagation.

    "abstract": "Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths, enabling cancer cells to expand to secondary sites and compromise organ function1. Given that primary tumors and metastases often share the same constellation of driver mutations2-4, the mechanisms driving their distinct phenotypes are unclear. Here, we show that inactivation of the frequently mutated tumor suppressor gene, liver kinase B1 (LKB1), has evolving effects throughout lung cancer progression, leading to the differential epigenetic re-programming of early-stage primary tumors compared to late-stage metastases. By integrating genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 screening with bulk and single-cell multi-omic analyses, we unexpectedly identify LKB1 as a master regulator of chromatin accessibility in lung adenocarcinoma primary tumors. Using an in vivo model of metastatic progression, we further reveal that loss of LKB1 activates the early endoderm transcription factor SOX17 in metastases and a metastatic-like sub-population of cancer cells within primary tumors. SOX17 expression is necessary and sufficient to drive a second wave of epigenetic changes in LKB1-deficient cells that enhances metastatic ability. Overall, our study demonstrates how the downstream effects of an individual driver mutation can appear to change throughout cancer development, with implications for stage-specific therapeutic resistance mechanisms and the gene regulatory underpinnings of metastatic evolution.",

    "abstract": "Seeds are essential for plant reproduction, survival, and dispersal. Germination ability and successful establishment of young seedlings strongly depends on seed quality and on environmental factors such as nutrient availability. In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) and many other species, seed quality and seedling establishment characteristics are determined by genetic variation, as well as the maternal environment in which the seeds develop and mature. The genetic contribution to variation in seed and seedling quality traits and environmental responsiveness can be estimated at transcriptome level in the dry seed by mapping genomic loci that affect gene expression (expression QTLs) in contrasting maternal environments.\n\nIn this study, we applied RNA-sequencing to measure gene expression of seeds of a tomato RIL population derived from a cross between S. lycopersicum (cv. Moneymaker) and S. pimpinellifolium (G1.1554). The seeds matured on plants cultivated under different nutritional environments; i.e. on high phosphorus or low nitrogen. The obtained SNPs were subsequently used to construct a high-density genetic map. We show how the genetic landscape of plasticity in gene regulation in dry seeds is affected by the maternal nutrient environment. The combined information on natural genetic variation mediating (variation in) responsiveness to the environment may contribute to knowledge-based breeding programs aiming to develop crop cultivars that are resilient to stressful environments.",

While GS is expressed by astrocytes of the central nervous system (CNS), expression in other glial lineages has been noted. Using a combination of reporter mice and cell typespecific markers, we show that GS is expressed in myelinating oligodendrocytes (OL) but not oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPC) of the mouse spinal cord abutting ventral horn motor neurons. To investigate the role of GS in mature OL, we used a conditional knockout (cKO) approach to selectively delete GS-encoding gene (Glul) in OL, which caused a significant decrease in glutamine levels on spinal cord extracts. We evaluated the effect on ventral spinal cord sensorimotor circuits and observed that GS cKO mice (CNP-cre+: Glulfl/fl) showed no differences in motor neuron numbers, size or axon density; OL differentiation and myelination in the ventral spinal cord at 1- and 6-months of age was normal. Interestingly, GS cKO mice showed an early and specific decrease in peak force while motor function remained otherwise unaffected.

    "abstract": "Since the advent of gene knockout technology in 1987, insight into the role(s) of neuropeptides in centrally- and peripherally-mediated physiological regulation has been gleaned by examining altered physiological functioning in mammals, predominantly mice, after genetic editing to produce animals deficient in neuropeptides or their cognate G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). These results have complemented experiments involving infusion of neuropeptide agonists or antagonists systemically or into specific brain regions. Effects of gene loss are often interpreted as indicating that the peptide and its receptor(s) are required for the physiological or behavioral responses elicited in wild-type mice at the time of experimental examination. These interpretations presume that peptide/peptide receptor gene deletion affects only the expression of the peptide/receptor itself, and therefore impacts physiological events only at the time at which the experiment is conducted. A way to support  real-time interpretations of neuropeptide gene knock-out is to demonstrate that the wild-type transcriptome, except for the deliberately deleted gene(s), in tissues of interest, is preserved in the knock-out mouse. Here, we show that there is a cohort of genes (constitutively PACAP-Regulated Genes, or cPRGs) whose basal expression is affected by constitutive knock-out of the Adcyap1 gene in C57Bl6/N mice, and additional genes whose expression in response to physiological challenge, in adults, is altered or impaired in the absence of PACAP expression (acutely PACAP-Regulated Genes, or aPRGs). Distinguishing constitutive and acute transcriptomic effects of neuropeptide deficiency on physiological function and behavior in mice reveals alternative mechanisms of action, and changing functions of neuropeptides, throughout the lifespan.",

    "abstract": "The Pearson correlation coefficient squared, r2, is often used in the analysis of neural data to estimate the relationship between neural tuning curves. Yet this metric is biased by trial-to-trial variability: as trial-to-trial variability increases, measured correlation decreases. Major lines of research are confounded by this bias, including the study of invariance of neural tuning across conditions and the similarity of tuning across neurons. To address this, we extend the estimator, [Formula], developed for estimating model-to-neuron correlation to the neuron-to-neuron case. We compare the estimator to a prior method developed by Spearman, commonly used in other fields but widely overlooked in neuroscience, and find that our method has less bias. We then apply our estimator to the study of two forms of invariance and demonstrate how it avoids drastic confounds introduced by trial-to-trial variability.\n\nSignificant StatementQuantifying the similarity between two sets of averaged neural responses is fundamental to the analysis of neural data. A ubiquitous metric of similarity, the correlation coefficient, is attenuated by trial-to-trial variability that depends on a variety of irrelevant factors. Spearman recognized this problem and proposed corrected methods that have been extended over a century. We show this method has large asymptotic biases and derive a novel estimator to overcome this. Despite the frequent use of the correlation coefficient in neuroscience, consensus on how to address this fundamental statistical issue has not been reached. We both explicate this issue in a neuroscience setting while at the same time making major strides in addressing it.",

    "abstract": "Attention to faces and eye contact are key behaviors for establishing social bonds in humans. In Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) a neurodevelopmental disturbance characterized by poor communication skills, impaired face processing and gaze avoidance are critical clinical features for its diagnosis. The biological alterations underlying these impairments are not clear yet. Using high-density electroencephalography coupled with multi-variate pattern classification and group blind source separation methods we searched for face- and face components-related neural signals that could best discriminate neurotypical and ASD visual processing. First, we isolated a face-specific neural signal in the superior temporal sulcus peaking at 240ms after stimulus onset. A machine learning algorithm applied on the extracted neural component reached 74% decoding accuracy at the same latencies, dissociating the neurotypical population from ASD subjects in whom this signal was weak. Further, by manipulating attention to face parts we found that the signal-evoked power in neurotypical subjects varied as a function of the distance of the eyes in the face stimulus with respect to the viewers fovea, i.e. it was strongest when the eyes were projected on the fovea and weakest when projected in the retinal periphery. Such selective face and face-components neural modulations were not found in ASD individuals although they showed typical early face related P100 and the N170 signals. These findings show that dedicated cortical mechanisms related to face perception set neural priority for attention to eyes and that these mechanisms are altered in individuals with ASD.",

Mitochondria are recently recognized to be related to the pathophysiology of sepsis, and mitochondria could serve as a potential drug target.

The gene expression profiles of the GSE167914 dataset were originally created by using the Nanostring nCounter Elements TagSet preselected for mitochondrial biogenesis and function panel. The biological pathways were analyzed by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG), Gene Ontology (GO), and Reactome enrichment. KEGG and GO results showed the Neurodegeneration pathways such as Huntington and Parkinson pathways were mostly affected in the development of sepsis. Moreover, we identified several mitochondrial genes including TOMM40, TOMM20, TIMM22, TIMM10, TIMM17A, TIMM9, TIMM44 were involved in the regulation of protein translocation into mitochondria. Further, we predicted several regulators that had the ability to affect the mitochondria during sepsis by L1000fwd analysis.

A proof-of-concept screen showed that the BCR-ABL inhibitor nilotinib, but not the structurally similar imatinib, blocks inflammatory responses. In order to identify the cellular (off-)targets of nilotinib, we performed thermal proteome profiling (TPP). Unlike imatinib, nilotinib and other later generation BCR-ABL inhibitors inhibit the p38-MK2/3 signalling axis which suppressed the expression of inflammatory cytokines, cell adhesion and innate immunity markers in activated human monocytes derived from AML. Thus, our study provides a tool for the discovery of new anti-inflammatory drugs, which could contribute to the treatment of inflammation in myeloid neoplasms and other diseases.\n\nKey PointsLabel-free cell-based assay identifies new anti-inflammatory drugs using MALDI-TOF MS.

Currently, the exact cause of the infestation is still undetermined. Studying the bacterial community of M. plana could provide insight on the problem as the bacteria associated with insects often provide numerous benefits to the insect itself. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, the study was conducted to compare the composition of the bacterial communities of two larval stages (early instar stage and late instar stage) from outbreak area, as well as comparing the late instar stage larvae from non-outbreak and outbreak areas. Generally, the bacterial community was dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria phyla while the Enterobacteriaceae was found to be the dominant family. When comparing between the early and late instar stage, Proteobacteria phylum was found to be more abundant in the late instar stage (82.36%) than in the early instar stage (82.28%). At the family level, the Enterobacteriaceae was slightly more abundant in late instar stage (75.46%) than in early instar stage (75.29%). The instar stage was observed to have no significant impact on the bacterial variability and showed similar bacterial community structure.

    "abstract": "New variants of SARS-CoV-2 are continuing to emerge and dominate the regional and global sequence landscapes. Several variants have been labelled as Variants of Concern (VOCs) because of perceptions or evidence that these may have a transmission advantage, increased risk of morbidly and/or mortality or immune evasion in the context of prior infection or vaccination. Placing the VOCs in context and also the underlying variability of SARS-CoV-2 is essential in understanding virus evolution and selection pressures. Sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs from hospitalised patients in the UK were determined and virus isolated. The data indicated the virus existed as a population with a consensus level and non-synonymous changes at a minor variant. For example, viruses containing the nsp12 P323L variation from the Wuhan reference sequence, contained minor variants at the position including P and F and other amino acids. These populations were generally preserved when isolates were amplified in cell culture. In order to place VOCs B.1.1.7 (the UK  Kent variant) and B.1.351 (the  South African variant) in context their growth was compared to a spread of other clinical isolates. The data indicated that the growth in cell culture of the B.1.1.7 VOC was no different from other variants, suggesting that its apparent transmission advantage was not down to replicating more quickly. Growth of B.1.351 was towards the higher end of the variants. Overall, the study suggested that studying the biology of SARS-CoV-2 is complicated by population dynamics and that these need to be considered with new variants.\n\nImportanceSARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of COVID-19. The virus has spread across the planet causing a global pandemic. In common with other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 genetic material (genomes) can become quite diverse as a consequence of replicating inside cells. This has given rise to multiple variants from the original virus that infected humans. These variants may have different properties and in the context of a widespread vaccination program may render vaccines less ineffective. Our research confirms the degree of genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 in patients. By isolating viruses from these patients, we show that there is a 100-fold range in growth of even normal variants. Interestingly, by comparing this to the pattern seen with two Variants of Concern (UK and South African variants), we show that at least in cells the ability of the B.1.1.7 variant to grow is not substantially different to many of the previous variants.",

    "abstract": "The SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein is a critical component of subunit vaccines and a target for neutralizing antibodies. Spike is also undergoing immunogenic selection with clinical variants that increase infectivity and partially escape convalescent plasma. Here, we describe spike display, a high-throughput platform to rapidly characterize glycosylated spike ectodomains across multiple coronavirus-family proteins. We assayed [~]200 variant SARS-CoV-2 spikes for their expression, ACE2 binding, and recognition by thirteen neutralizing antibodies (nAbs). An alanine scan of all five N-terminal domain (NTD) loops highlights a public class of epitopes in the N1, N3, and N5 loops that are recognized by most of the NTD-binding nAbs. Some clinical NTD substitutions abrogate binding to these epitopes but are circulating at low frequencies around the globe. NTD mutations in variants of concern B.1.1.7 (United Kingdom), B.1.351 (South Africa), B.1.1.248 (Brazil), and B.1.427/B.1.429 (California) impact spike expression and escape most NTD-targeting nAbs. However, two classes of NTD nAbs still bind B.1.1.7 spikes and neutralize in pseudoviral assays. B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 include compensatory mutations that either increase spike expression or increase ACE2 binding affinity. Finally, B.1.351 and B.1.1.248 completely escape a potent ACE2 peptide mimic. We anticipate that spike display will accelerate antigen design, deep scanning mutagenesis, and antibody epitope mapping for SARS-CoV-2 and other emerging viral threats.",

In this context, a control circuit is objectively \"well regulated\" when discrepancy between desired and achieved output trajectories is minimized, and \"robust\" to the degree that it is able to regulate well in response to a wide range of stimuli. Most psychiatric disorders are assumed to reflect dysregulation of brain circuits. Yet, probing circuit regulation requires fundamentally different analytic strategies than the correlations relied upon for analyses of connectivity and their resultant networks. Here, we demonstrate how well-established methods for system identification in control systems engineering may be applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to extract generative computational models of human brain circuits.

    "abstract": "Discovering the rules of synaptic plasticity is an important step for understanding brain learning. Existing plasticity models are either 1) top-down and interpretable, but not flexible enough to account for experimental data, or 2) bottom-up and biologically realistic, but too intricate to interpret and hard to fit to data. To avoid the shortcomings of these approaches, we present a new plasticity rule based on a geometrical readout mechanism that flexibly maps synaptic enzyme dynamics to predict plasticity outcomes. We apply this readout to a multi-timescale model of hippocampal synaptic plasticity induction that includes electrical dynamics, calcium, CaMKII and calcineurin, and accurate representation of intrinsic noise sources. Using a single set of model parameters, we demonstrate the robustness of this plasticity rule by reproducing nine published ex vivo experiments covering various spike-timing and frequency-dependent plasticity induction protocols, animal ages, and experimental conditions. Our model also predicts that in vivo-like spike timing irregularity strongly shapes plasticity outcome. This geometrical readout modelling approach can be readily applied to other excitatory or inhibitory synapses to discover their synaptic plasticity rules.",

    "abstract": "Eye tracking has been an essential tool within the vision science community for many years. However, the majority of studies involving eye-tracking technology employ a relatively passive approach through the use of static imagery, prescribed motion, or video stimuli. This is in contrast to our everyday interaction with the natural world where we navigate our environment while actively seeking and using task-relevant visual information. For this reason, vision researchers are beginning to use virtual environment platforms, which offer interactive, realistic visual environments while maintaining a substantial level of experimental control. Here, we recorded eye movement behavior while participants freely navigated through a complex virtual environment. Within this environment, participants completed a visual search task where they were asked to find and count occurrence of specific targets among numerous distractor items. We assigned each participant into one of four target groups: Humvees, motorcycles, aircraft, or furniture. Our results show a significant relationship between gaze behavior and target objects across subject groups. Specifically, we see an increased number of fixations and increase dwell time on target relative to distractor objects. In addition, we included a divided attention task to investigate how search patterns changed with the addition of a secondary task. With increased cognitive load, subjects slowed their speed, decreased gaze on objects, and increased the number of objects scanned in the environment. Overall, our results confirm previous findings from more controlled laboratory settings and demonstrate that complex virtual environments can be used for active visual search experimentation, maintaining a high level of precision in the quantification of gaze information and visual attention. This study contributes to our understanding of how individuals search for information in a naturalistic virtual environment. Likewise, our paradigm provides an intriguing look into the heterogeneity of individual behaviors when completing an un-timed visual search task while actively navigating.",

    "abstract": "The progress of therapeutic neuromodulation greatly depends on improving stimulation parameters to most efficiently induce neuroplasticity effects. Intermittent Theta Burst stimulation (iTBS), a form of electrical stimulation that mimics the natural brain activity patterns, has shown efficacy in inducing such effects in animal studies and rhythmic Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) studies in humans. However, little is known about the potential neuroplasticity effects of iTBS applied through intracranial electrodes in humans which could have implications for deep brain stimulation therapies. This study characterizes the physiological effects of cortical iTBS in the human cortex and compare them with single pulse alpha stimulation, another frequently used paradigm in rTMS research. We applied these stimulation paradigms to well-defined regions in the sensorimotor cortex which elicited contralateral hand or arm muscle contractions during electrical stimulation mapping in epilepsy patients implanted with intracranial electrodes. Treatment effects were evaluated using effective connectivity and beta oscillations coherence measures in areas connected to the treatment site as defined with cortico-cortical evoked potentials. Our results show that iTBS increases beta band synchronization within the sensorimotor network indicating a potential neuroplasticity effect. The effect is specific to the sensorimotor system, the beta frequency band and the stimulation pattern (no effect was found with single-pulse alpha stimulation). The effects outlasted the stimulation by three minutes. By characterizing the neurophysiological effects of iTBS within well-defined cortical networks, we hope to provide an electrophysiological framework that allows clinicians and researchers to optimize brain stimulation protocols which may have translational value.",

    "abstract": "PurposeFollowing a shortening or lengthening muscle contraction, the torque produced in the isometric steady state is distinctly lower (residual torque depression; rTD) or higher (residual torque enhancement; rTE), respectively, compared to a purely isometric contraction at the same final muscle length and level of activation. This is referred to as the history dependence of force. When matching a given torque level, there is greater muscle activation (electromyography; EMG) following shortening and less activation following lengthening. Owing to these differences in neuromuscular activation, it is unclear whether perception of effort is altered by the history dependence of force.\n\nMethodsExperiment 1 tested whether perception of effort differed between the rTD and rTE state when torque was matched. Experiment 2 tested whether perception of effort differed between the rTD and rTE state when EMG was matched. Finally, experiment 3 tested whether EMG differed between the rTD and rTE state when perception of effort was matched.\n\nResultsWhen torque was matched, both EMG and perception of effort were higher in the rTD compared to rTE state. When EMG was matched, torque was lower in the rTD compared to rTE state while perception of effort did not differ between the two states. When perception of effort was matched, torque was lower in the rTD compared to rTE state and EMG did not differ between the two states.\n\nConclusionThe combined results from these experiments indicate that the history dependence of force alters ones perception of effort, dependent on the level of motor command.",

Whether or not these inputs covary over time or between repeated stimuli remains unclear due to the lack of experimental methods for measuring both inputs simultaneously. We developed a new analytical framework for instantaneous and simultaneous measurements of both the excitatory and inhibitory neuronal inputs during a single trial under current clamp recording. This can be achieved by injecting a current composed of two high frequency sinusoidal components followed by analytical extraction of the conductances. We demonstrate the ability of this method to measure both inputs in a single trial under realistic recording constraints and from morphologically realistic CA1 pyramidal model cells.

    "abstract": "Seizures are thought to arise from an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity. While most classical studies suggest excessive excitatory neural activity plays a generative role, some recent findings challenge this view and instead argue that excessive activity in inhibitory neurons initiates seizures. We investigated this question of imbalance in a zebrafish seizure model with multi-regional two-photon imaging of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal activity using a nuclear-localized calcium sensor. We found that seizures consistently initiated in circumscribed zones of the midbrain before propagating to other brain regions. Excitatory neurons were both more prevalent and more likely to be recruited than inhibitory neurons in initiation as compared with propagation zones. These findings support a mechanistic picture whereby seizures initiate in a region of hyper-excitation, then propagate more broadly once inhibitory restraint in the surround is overcome.\n\nTeaserWe uncover the roles of excitation and inhibition during seizures, thus opening a path to more targeted therapy of epilepsy.",

    "abstract": "Value-based decision-making is often studied in a static context, where participants decide which option to select from those currently available. However, everyday life often involves an additional dimension: deciding when to select to maximise reward. Recent evidence suggests that agents track the latent reward of an option, updating changes in their latent reward estimate, to achieve appropriate selection timing (latent reward tracking). However, this strategy can be difficult to distinguish from one in which the optimal selection time is estimated in advance, allowing an agent to wait a pre-determined amount of time before selecting, without needing to monitor an options latent reward (distance-to-goal tracking). Here we show that these strategies can in principle be dissociated. Human brain activity was recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) while female and male participants performed a novel decision task. Participants were shown an option and decided when to select it, as its latent reward changed from trial-to-trial. While the latent reward was uncued, it could be estimated using cued information about the options starting value and value growth rate. We then used representational similarity analysis to assess whether EEG signals more closely resembled latent reward tracking or distance-to-goal tracking. This approach successfully dissociated the strategies in this task. Starting value and growth rate were translated into a distance-to-goal signal, far in advance of selecting the option. Latent reward could not be independently decoded. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using high temporal resolution neural recordings to identify internally computed decision variables in the human brain.\n\nSignificance StatementReward-seeking behaviour involves acting at the right time. However, the external world does not always tell us when an action is most rewarding, necessitating internal representations that guide action timing. Specifying this internal neural representation is challenging because it might stem from a variety of strategies, many of which make similar predictions about brain activity. This study used a novel approach to test whether alternative strategies could be dissociated in principle. Using representational similarity analysis, we were able to distinguish between candidate internal representations for selection timing. This shows how pattern analysis methods can be used to measure latent decision information in non-invasive neural data.",

    "abstract": "Saccades change eye position and interrupt vision several times per second, necessitating neural mechanisms for continuous perception of object identity, orientation, and location. Neuroimaging studies suggest that occipital and parietal cortex play complementary roles for transsaccadic perception of intrinsic versus extrinsic spatial properties, e.g., dorsomedial occipital cortex (cuneus) is sensitive to changes in spatial frequency, whereas the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) is modulated by changes in object orientation. Based on this, we hypothesized that both structures would be recruited to simultaneously monitor identity and orientation across saccades. To test this, we merged two previous neuroimaging protocols: 21 participants viewed a 2D object and then, after sustained fixation or a saccade, judged whether the shape or orientation of the represented object changed. We, then, performed a bilateral region-of-interest analysis on identified cuneus and SMG sites. As hypothesized, cuneus showed both saccade and feature (i.e., orientation vs. shape change) modulations, and right SMG showed saccade-feature interactions. Further, the cuneus activity time course correlated with several other cortical saccade / visual areas, suggesting a  functional network for feature discrimination. These results confirm the involvement of occipital / parietal cortex in transsaccadic vision and support complementary roles in spatial versus identity updating.",

Our analysis of gene and protein expression along the respiratory tract shows that IFNs, especially IFN-III, are over-represented in the lower airways of patients with severe COVID-19, while high levels of IFN-III, and to a lesser extent IFN-I, characterize the upper airways of patients with high viral burden but reduced disease risk or severity; also, IFN expression varies with abundance of the cell types that produce them.

    "abstract": "Curing HIV will require eliminating the reservoir of integrated, replication-competent proviruses that persist despite antiretroviral therapy (ART). Understanding the burden, genetic diversity and longevity of persisting proviruses in diverse individuals with HIV is critical to this goal, but these characteristics remain understudied in some groups. Among them are viremic controllers, individuals who naturally suppress HIV to low levels but for whom therapy is nevertheless recommended. We reconstructed within-host HIV evolutionary histories from longitudinal single-genome amplified viral sequences in four viremic controllers who eventually initiated ART, and used this information to characterize the age and diversity of proviruses persisting on therapy. We further leveraged these within-host proviral age distributions to estimate rates of proviral turnover prior to ART. This is an important yet understudied metric, since pre-ART proviral turnover dictates reservoir composition at ART initiation (and thereafter), which is when curative interventions, once developed, would be administered. Despite natural viremic control, all participants displayed significant within-host HIV evolution pre-therapy, where overall on-ART proviral burden and diversity broadly reflected the extent of viral replication and diversity pre-ART. Consistent with recent studies of non-controllers, the proviral pools of two participants were skewed towards sequences that integrated near ART initiation, suggesting dynamic proviral turnover during untreated infection. In contrast, proviruses recovered from the two other participants dated to time-points that were more evenly spread throughout infection, suggesting slow or negligible proviral decay following deposition. HIV cure strategies will need to overcome within-host proviral diversity, even in individuals who naturally controlled HIV replication before therapy.\n\nImportanceHIV therapy is life-long because integrated, replication-competent viral copies persist within long-lived cells. To cure HIV, we need to understand when these viral reservoirs form, how large and genetically diverse they are, and how long they endure. Elite controllers, individuals who naturally suppress HIV to undetectable levels, are being intensely studied as models of HIV remission, but viremic controllers, individuals who naturally suppress HIV to low levels, remain understudied even though they too may hold valuable insights. We combined phylogenetics and mathematical modeling to reconstruct proviral seeding and decay from infection to therapy-mediated suppression in four viremic controllers. We recovered diverse proviruses persisting during therapy that broadly reflected HIVs within-host evolutionary history, where the estimated half-lives of the persistent proviral pool during untreated infection ranged from <1 year to negligible. Cure strategies will need to contend with proviral diversity and between-host heterogeneity, even in individuals who naturally control HIV.",

    "abstract": "Using data on rearing and welfare metrics of multiple commercial broiler flocks from the last ten years, we investigate how welfare measures such as hock burn, mortality, weight, and pododermatitis, among others, impact the likelihood of a flock becoming colonized by Campylobacter. Using both logistic regression and Bayesian networks, we show that, while some welfare metrics were weakly related to Campylobacter colonization, evidence could not be found to suggest that these metrics actively exacerbated Campylobacter colonization, rather that they were both symptoms of the same underlying cause. Instead, observed dependency on the management of the flock suggested that yet-undiscovered differences in rearing practise were the principal cause of both poor bird welfare and increased risk of Campylobacter, suggesting that action can be taken to improve both these factors simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Strain and environmental nutrient concentrations can affect the production of sensory impact compounds during yeast fermentation. Despite reports on the impact of nutrient conditions on kinetics of cellular growth, it is uncertain to what extent nitrogen utilization by commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae wine strains affects the production of volatile organic (aroma) compounds (VOCs). Here we ask whether i) consumption of amino acids contribute to VOCs (fusel alcohols, acetate esters, and fatty acid esters) in commercial S. cerevisiae yeast strains, ii) there is inter-strain variation in VOC production, and iii) there is a correlation between the production of aroma compounds and nitrogen utilization. We analyzed the consumption of nutrients as well as the production of major VOCs during fermentation of a chemically defined grape juice medium with four commercial S. cerevisiae yeast strains: Elixir, Opale, R2, and Uvaferm. The production of VOCs was variable among the strains where Uvaferm correlated with ethyl acetate and ethyl hexanoate production, R2 negatively correlated with the acetate esters, and Opale positively correlated with fusel alcohols. The four strains total biomass formation was similar, pointing to metabolic differences in the utilization of nutrients to form secondary metabolites such as VOCs. To understand the strain-dependent differences in VOC production, partial least-squares linear regression coupled with genome-scale metabolic modeling was performed with the objective to correlate nitrogen utilization with fermentation biomass and volatile formation. Total aroma production was found to be a strong function of nitrogen utilization (R2 = 0.87). We found that glycine, tyrosine, leucine, and lysine utilization were positively correlated with fusel alcohols and acetate esters concentrations e.g., 2-phenyl acetate during wine fermentation. Parsimonious flux balance analysis and flux enrichment analysis confirmed the usage of these nitrogen utilization pathways based on the strains VOC production phenotype.\n\nIMPORTANCESaccharomyces cerevisiae is widely used in grape juice fermentation to produce wines. Along with the genetic background, the nitrogen in the environment in which S. cerevisiae grows impacts its regulation of metabolism. Also, commercial S. cerevisiae strains exhibit immense diversity in their formation of aromas, and a desirable aroma bouquet is an essential characteristic for wines. Since nitrogen affects aroma formation in wines, it is essential to know the extent of this connection and how it leads to strain-dependent aroma profiles in wines. We evaluated the differences in the production of key aroma compounds among four commercial wine strains. Moreover, we analyzed the role of nitrogen utilization on the formation of various aroma compounds. This work illustrates the unique aroma producing differences among industrial yeast strains and suggests more intricate, nitrogen associated routes influencing those aroma producing differences.",

Here, we employed a within-subject intervention in the classroom with pupils in upper secondary schools followed by a test situation during brain imaging with fMRI one week later. We hypothesized that learning with CMR compared to AR should lead to a CMR-effect, characterized by better performance and differential brain activity during test. We observed higher brain activity in key regions for mathematical cognition such as left angular gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus on tasks previously learnt with CMR compared to AR. The effects remained when controlling for individual differences in cognitive abilities, as well as performance and response time differences between the two conditions. Encouraging pupils to engage in constructive processes when learning mathematical reasoning might thus have lasting beneficial effects.",

While these distinct CT projections have long been thought to have different functional influences on the HO thalamus, this has never been directly tested. By optogenetically inactivating different CT populations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of awake mice, we demonstrate that layer 5, but not layer 6, CT projections drive visual responses in the HO visual pulvinar, even while both pathways provide retinotopic, baseline excitation to their thalamic targets. Inactivating the superior colliculus also suppressed visual responses in the pulvinar, demonstrating that cortical layer 5 and subcortical inputs both contribute to HO visual thalamic activity - even at the level of putative single neurons. Altogether, these results indicate a functional division of driver and modulator CT pathways from V1 to the visual thalamus in vivo.",

    "abstract": "The NBA player Stephen Curry has a habit of turning away from the basket right after taking three-point shots, presumably because he can predict the success of his shot. For such a consciously accessible prediction to be possible, Stephen Curry needs access to internal processes of outcome prediction and valuation. Computational simulations and empirical data suggest that the quality of internal prediction processes is related to motor expertise. Whether the results of internal predictions can reliably be consciously accessed is less clear. In the current study, 30 participants each practiced a virtual goal-oriented throwing task for 1000 trials. Every second trial, they were required to verbally predict the success of the current throw. Results showed that on average, conscious prediction accuracy was above an individually computed chance level, taking into account individual success rates and response strategies. Furthermore, prediction accuracy was related to throwing performance. Participants with better performance predicted the success of their throws more accurately than participants with poorer performance. Moreover, for the poorer performing individuals, movement execution was negatively affected by the verbalized predictions required, and they did not show variation in speech characteristics (response latency) between correct and incorrect predictions. This indicates reduced quality of conscious access to internal processes of outcome prediction.",

MetS gut phageome populations exhibited decreased richness and diversity, but larger inter-individual variation. These populations were enriched in phages infecting Bacteroidaceae and depleted in those infecting Ruminococcaeae. Differential abundance analysis identified eighteen viral clusters (VCs) as significantly associated with either MetS or healthy phageomes.

Further analysis of these VCs revealed the Candidatus Heliusviridae, a highly widespread gut phage lineage found in 90+% of the participants. The identification of the temperate Ca.

To unravel how DCSs influence rhizosphere competence of plant beneficial rhizobacteria, we carried out a functional and transcriptome analysis on the plant beneficial bacterium Lysobacter capsici AZ78 (AZ78). Results reveal that 13-methyltetradecanoic acid and indole, glyoxylic acid and 2,3-butanedione play a relevant role in the interaction between L. capsici members and other soil-living (micro)organisms. DCSs regulated mechanisms of multistress and multidrug tolerance and persistence, including detoxification, motility, antibiotic production, and expression of secretion systems. In particular, 13-methyltetradecanoic acid, glyoxylic acid and 2,3-butanedione might enable AZ78 to rapidly colonize the rhizosphere. Moreover, glyoxylic acid and 2,3-butanedione elicit biological responses to outcompete other (micro)organisms. In contrast, indole inactivates twitching motility and antibiotic production. These results demonstrate that DCSs influence the functioning of plant beneficial rhizobacteria and suggest that plant beneficial L. capsici strains could use them to foster rhizosphere colonization and enhance in vivo activities to increase soil health and plant fitness.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundPlasmodium knowlesi is now the major cause of human malaria in Malaysia, complicating malaria control efforts that must attend to the elimination of multiple Plasmodium species. Recent advances in the cultivation of P. knowlesi erythrocytic-stage parasites in vitro, transformation with exogenous DNA, and infection of mosquitoes with gametocytes from culture have opened up studies of this pathogen without the need for resource-intensive and costly non-human primate (NHP) models. For further understanding and development of methods for parasite transformation in malaria research, this study examined the activity of various trans-species transcriptional control sequences and the influence of Plasmodium vivax centromeric (pvcen) repeats in plasmid-transfected P. knowlesi parasites.\n\nMethodsIn vitro cultivated P. knowlesi parasites were transfected with plasmid constructs that incorporated P. vivax or Plasmodium falciparum 5 UTRs driving the expression of bioluminescence markers (firefly luciferase or Nanoluc). Promoter activities were assessed by bioluminescence, and parasites transformed with human resistant allele dihydrofolate reductase-expressing plasmids were selected using antifolates. The stability of transformants carrying pvcen-stabilized episomes was assessed by bioluminescence over a complete parasite life cycle through a rhesus macaque monkey, mosquitoes, and a second rhesus monkey.\n\nResultsLuciferase expression assessments show that certain P. vivax promoter regions, not functional in the more evolutionarily-distant P. falciparum, can drive transgene expression in P. knowlesi. Further, pvcen repeats may improve the stability of episomal plasmids in P. knowlesi and support detection of NanoLuc-expressing elements over the full parasite life cycle from rhesus macaque monkeys to Anopheles dirus mosquitoes and back again to monkeys. In assays of drug responses to chloroquine, G418 and WR9910, antimalarial half-inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of blood stages measured by NanoLuc activity proved comparable to IC50 values measured by the standard SYBR Green method.\n\nConclusionAll three P. vivax promoters tested in this study functioned in P. knowlesi whereas two of the three were inactive in P. falciparum. NanoLuc-expressing, centromere-stabilized plasmids may support high-throughput screenings of P. knowlesi for new antimalarial agents, including compounds that can block the development of mosquito- and/or liver-stage parasites.",

We find that, surprisingly, in-cell stability is a greater driver of protein output than high ribosome load. We further introduce a method called In-line-seq, applied to thousands of diverse RNAs, that reveals sequence and structure-based rules for mitigating hydrolytic degradation.

    "abstract": "Septins are a family of filament-forming GTP-binding proteins that regulate fundamental cellular activities such as cytokinesis, cell polarity, and membrane remodelling. In general, Septin filaments function as barriers and scaffolds on the cell cortex. However, little is known about the mechanism that governs the recruitment and localization of the Septin complex to the cell cortex. Here, we identified the Cdc42 GTPase activating protein Rga6 as a key protein involved in promoting the localization of the Septin complex to the cell cortex in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Rga6 interacts with the Septin complex and colocalizes with the Septin complex on the cell cortex. Live-cell microscopic analysis further showed Septin enrichment at the cortical regions adjacent to the growing cell tip. The Septin enrichment likely plays a crucial role in confining active Cdc42 to the growing cell tip. Hence, our findings support a model that Rga6 regulates polarized cell growth partly through promoting targeted localization of the Septin complex on the cell cortex.",

Loss of caspase-2 is known to increase proliferation rates but how caspase-2 is regulating this process is currently unclear. We show that caspase-2 is activated in dividing cells in G1- and early S-phase. In the absence of caspase-2, cells exhibit numerous S-phase defects including delayed exit from S-phase, S-phase-associated chromosomal aberrations, and increased DNA damage following S-phase arrest. In addition, caspase-2-deficient cells have a higher frequency of stalled replication forks, decreased DNA fiber length, and impeded progression of DNA replication tracts. This indicates that caspase-2 reduces replication stress and promotes replication fork protection to maintain genomic stability. These functions are independent of the pro-apoptotic function of caspase-2 because blocking caspase-2-induced cell death had no effect on cell division or DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest. Thus, our data supports a model where caspase-2 regulates cell cycle events to protect from the accumulation of DNA damage independently of its pro-apoptotic function.",

    "abstract": "While the gut microbiome and host gene regulation separately contribute to gastrointestinal disorders, it is unclear how the two may interact to influence host pathophysiology. Here, we developed a machine learning-based framework to jointly analyze host transcriptomic and microbiome profiles from 416 colonic mucosal samples of patients with colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, and irritable bowel syndrome. We identified potential interactions between gut microbes and host genes that are disease-specific, as well as interactions that are shared across the three diseases, involving host genes and gut microbes previously implicated in gastrointestinal inflammation, gut barrier protection, energy metabolism, and tumorigenesis. In addition, we found that mucosal gut microbes that have been associated with all three diseases, such as Streptococcus, interact with different host pathways in each disease, suggesting that similar microbes can affect host pathophysiology in a disease-specific manner through regulation of different host genes.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial peptides are a promising class of alternative antibiotics that interact selectively with negatively charged lipid bilayers. This paper presents the structural characterization of the antimicrobial peptides myxinidin and WMR associated with bacterial membrane mimetic micelles and bicelles by NMR, CD spectroscopy, and Molecular Dynamics simulations. Both peptides adopt a different conformation in the lipidic environment than in aqueous solution. The location of peptides in micelles and bicelles has been studied by paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments with paramagnetic tagged 5- and 16-doxyl stearic acid (5-/16-SASL). Multi-microsecond long molecular dynamics simulations of multiple copies of the peptides were used to gain an atomic level of detail on membrane-peptide and peptide-peptide interactions. Our results highlight an essential role of the negatively charged membrane mimetic in the structural stability of both myxinidin and WMR. The peptides localize predominantly in the membranes headgroup region and have a noticeable membrane thinning effect on the overall bilayer structure. Myxinidin and WMR show different tendency to selfaggregate, which is also influenced by the membrane composition (DOPE/DOPG versus DOPE/DOPG/CL) and can be related to the previously observed difference in the ability of the peptides to disrupt different types of model membranes.",

Immunodeficient mice are persistently infected with MKPV, leading to chronic renal disease, morbidity and mortality whereas immunocompetent mice seroconvert with mild renal pathology. Given the high incidence of MKPV infection in wild mice in the New York City area, the first goal of this study was to evaluate the possibility of MKPV involvement in feline chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the same geographic region. As MKPV and related parvoviruses recently described in other animal species appear to have a tropism for kidney tissue, the second goal was to investigate the possible role of a virus of this group, other than MKPV, in the development of feline CKD, Presence of MKPV and related viruses was investigated in feline renal samples using PCR, RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Cats were divided into three groups: normal (N=25), CKD (N=25) and immune suppressed (N=25). None of the kidney tissues from any of the 75 cats revealed the presence of MKPV DNA, RNA or antigen expression. Nor was \"fechavirus\" detected using PCR in renal tissue from cats with chronic kidney disease. We conclude that MKPV is an unlikely cause or contributor to feline CKD.",

Clinical manifestations of CEP include bone fragility, severe photosensitivity and photomutilation. Currently there is no specific treatment for CEP, except bone marrow transplantation, and there is an unmet need for treating this orphan disease. Fluorescent porphyrins cause protein aggregation, which led us to hypothesize that uroporphyrin-I accumulation leads to protein aggregation and CEP-related bone phenotype. We developed a zebrafish model that phenocopies features of CEP. As in human patients, uroporphyrin-I accumulated in the bones of zebrafish, leading to impaired bone development. Furthermore, in an osteoblast-like cell line, uroporphyrin-I decreased mineralization, aggregated bone matrix proteins, activated endoplasmic reticulum stress and disrupted autophagy. Using high-throughput drug screening, we identified acitretin, a second-generation retinoid, and showed that it reduced uroporphyrin-I accumulation and its deleterious effects on bones. Our findings provide a new CEP experimental model and a potential repurposed therapeutic.",

The well-known Shapley value framework based on game theory works in principle with any models to attribute feature importance. While feature interactions are critical to understand and can be interpreted within this framework, much attention is paid in practice on global feature importance and general trends of interactions. The inter-relationships between underlying model structure and Shapley value and its decomposition is less clear. Here we use binary classifiers to systematically examine how logical and additive interactions affect marginal contributions. These decomposed main and interaction effects are reflected in resulting Shapley dependence plots. The directionality of inequalities or logical/additive operators influence independently the main and marginal/interaction effects.

Our analyses of spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging data and phasic bursts in both locus coeruleus and basal forebrain demonstrate precise time-locked relationships between brainstem activity, low-dimensional energy landscapes, network topology, and spatiotemporal travelling waves. We extend our analysis to a cohort of experienced meditators and demonstrate locus coeruleus-mediated network dynamics were associated with internal shifts in conscious awareness.

    "abstract": "Stable isotope probing (SIP) approaches are a critical tool in microbiome research to determine associations between species and substrates. The application of these approaches ranges from studying microbial communities important for global biogeochemical cycling to host-microbiota interactions in the intestinal tract. Current SIP approaches, such as DNA-SIP or nanoSIMS, are limited in terms of sensitivity, resolution or throughput. Here we present an ultra-sensitive, high-throughput protein-based stable isotope probing approach (Protein-SIP), which cuts cost for labeled substrates by [~]90% as compared to other SIP and Protein-SIP approaches and thus enables isotope labeling experiments on much larger scales and with higher replication. It allows for the determination of isotope incorporation into microbiome members with species level resolution using standard metaproteomics LC-MS/MS measurements. The analysis has been implemented as an open-source application (https://sourceforge.net/projects/calis-p/). We demonstrate sensitivity, precision and accuracy using bacterial cultures and mock communities with different labeling schemes. Furthermore, we benchmark our approach against two existing Protein-SIP approaches and show that in the low labeling range used our approach is the most sensitive and accurate. Finally, we measure translational activity using 18O heavy water labeling in a 63-species community derived from human fecal samples grown on media simulating two different diets. Activity could be quantified on average for 27 species per sample, with 9 species showing significantly higher activity on a high protein diet, as compared to a high fiber diet. Surprisingly, among the species with increased activity on high protein were several Bacteroides species known as fiber consumers. Apparently, protein supply is a critical consideration when assessing growth of intestinal microbes on fiber, including fiber based prebiotics. In summary, we demonstrate that our Protein-SIP approach allows for the ultra-sensitive (0.01% to 10% label) detection of stable isotopes of elements found in proteins, using standard metaproteomics data.",

    "abstract": "The symbiosis between the Hawaiian bobtail squid, Euprymna scolopes, and its exclusive light-organ symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, provides a natural system in which to study host-microbe specificity and gene regulation during the establishment of a mutually-beneficial symbiosis. Colonization of the host relies on bacterial biofilm-like aggregation in the squid mucus field. Symbiotic biofilm formation is controlled by a two-component signaling (TCS) system consisting of regulators RscS-SypF-SypG, which together direct transcription of the Syp symbiotic polysaccharide. TCS systems are broadly important for bacteria to sense environmental cues and then direct changes in behavior. Previously, we identified hybrid histidine kinase BinK as a strong negative regulator of V. fischeri biofilm regulation, and here we further explore the function of BinK. To inhibit biofilm formation, BinK requires the predicted phosphorylation sites in both the histidine kinase (H362) and receiver (D794) domains. Furthermore, we show that RscS is not essential for host colonization when binK is deleted from strain ES114, and imaging of aggregate size revealed no benefit to the presence of RscS in a background lacking BinK. Strains lacking RscS still suffered in competition. Finally, we show that BinK functions to inhibit biofilm gene expression in the light organ crypts, providing evidence for biofilm gene regulation at later stages of host colonization. Overall, this study provides direct evidence for opposing activities of RscS and BinK and yields novel insights into biofilm regulation during the maturation of a beneficial symbiosis.\n\nIMPORTANCEBacteria are often in a biofilm state, and transitions between planktonic and biofilm lifestyles are important for pathogenic, beneficial, and environmental microbes. The critical nature of biofilm formation during Vibrio fischeri colonization of the Hawaiian bobtail squid light organ provides an opportunity to study development of this process in vivo using a combination of genetic and imaging approaches. The current work refines the signaling circuitry of the biofilm pathway in V. fischeri, provides evidence that biofilm regulatory changes occur in the host, and identifies BinK as one of the regulators of that process. This study provides information about how bacteria regulate biofilm gene expression in an intact animal host.",

The molecular mechanisms used by satellites to hijack phages are sometimes understood in great detail, but the origins, abundance, distribution, and composition of these elements are poorly known. Here, we show that P4-like elements are present in more than 10% of the genomes of Enterobacterales, and in almost half of those of Escherichia coli, sometimes in multiple distinct copies. We identified over 1000 P4-like elements with very conserved genetic organization of the core genome and a few hotspots with highly variable genes. These elements are never found in plasmids and have very little homology to known phages, suggesting an independent evolutionary origin. Instead, they are scattered across chromosomes, possibly because their integrases are often exchanged with other elements. The rooted phylogenies of hijacking functions are correlated and suggest longstanding co-evolution. They also reveal broad host ranges in P4-like elements, since almost identical elements can be found in distinct bacterial genuses. Our results show that P4-like phage satellites constitute a very distinct, widespread and ancient family of mobile genetic elements. They pave the way for studying the molecular evolution of antagonistic interactions between phages and their satellites.",

However, pre-analysis factors, such as the delay in blood processing and storage may lead to unreliable results, though no study has systematically evaluated the effect of blood storage conditions on the whole transcriptome of plasma cfRNA yet.\n\nMETHODSWe collected peripheral blood samples from four healthy subjects and allowed them to stand at room temperature or 4{square} for different time periods (0h, 2h, 6h and 24h) prior to plasma separation. Then, plasma cfRNA stability was evaluated by measuring expression changes of cell-free mRNA, lncRNA and miRNA using high throughput sequencing-based profiling. Finally, their paired leukocyte RNA data were integrated to depict the effect of leukocytes on plasma cfRNA during storage.\n\nRESULTSPlasma mRNA and lncRNA presented high correlations (Pearson R2 [&ge;] 0.8) and fewer variations when blood was stored at 4{square} for 6 hours or stored at RT for 2 hours. miRNA was more stable, with minimal R2 of 0.86 at 4{square} for at least 24 hours or at RT for 6 hours. Correlations of plasma RNA and leukocyte RNA increased with the incubation time, and the relative proportion of neutrophils in plasma grown from 14.3% to 61.2% at RT (P = 0.004), indicating leukocyte RNA contamination. Besides, the tissue enriched genes in plasma were down-regulated with the extension of storage time.\n\nCONCLUSIONSOur results characterized the effects of short-term storage of blood samples on plasma cfRNA, which will facilitate further researches or clinical applications to avoid bias resulting from sample processing.",

    "abstract": "Infectious diseases represent one of the major challenges to sustainable aquaculture production. Rapid, accurate diagnosis and genotyping of emerging pathogens during early-suspected disease cases is critical to facilitate timely response to deploy adequate control measures and prevent or reduce spread. Currently, most laboratories use PCR to amplify partial pathogen genomic regions, occasionally combined with sequencing of PCR amplicon(s) using conventional Sanger sequencing services for confirmatory diagnosis. The main limitation of this approach is the lengthy turnaround time. Here, we report an innovative approach using a previously developed specific PCR assay for pathogen diagnosis combined with a new Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)-based amplicon sequencing method for pathogen genotyping. Using fish clinical samples, we applied this approach for the rapid confirmation of PCR amplicon sequences identity and genotyping of tilapia lake virus (TiLV), a disease-causing virus affecting tilapia aquaculture globally. The consensus sequences obtained after polishing exhibit strikingly high identity to references derived by Illumina and Sanger methods (99.83-100%). This study suggests that ONT-based amplicon sequencing is a promising platform to deploy in regional aquatic animal health diagnostic laboratories in low and medium income countries, for fast identification and genotyping of emerging infectious pathogens from field samples within a single day.",

We found that all the homologs bind to and deubiquitinate SQSTM1/p62 but with variable efficiency, which correlates with their capacity to prevent the colocalization of LC3 with SQSTM1/p62 aggregates and promote the accumulation of a model autophagy substrate.

    "abstract": "Helicobacter pylori exhibits specific geographic distributions that related to the clinical outcomes. Despite the high infection rate of H. pylori throughout the world, the genetic epidemiology surveillance of H. pylori still needs to be improved. Here, we used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) profiling approach based on whole genome sequencing (WGS) that facilitates genomic population analyses of H. pylori and encourages the dissemination of microbial genotyping strategies worldwide. A total number of 1,211 public H. pylori genomes were downloaded and used to construct the typing tool, named as HPTT (H. pylori Typing Tool). Combined with the metadata, we developed two levels of genomic typing, including a continent scale and a country scale that nested in the continent scale. Results showed that Asia was the largest isolates source in our dataset, while isolates from Europe and Oceania were comparatively more widespread. More specifically, Switzerland and Australia are the main source of widespread isolates in their corresponding continents. To integrate all the typing information and enable researchers to compare their own dataset against the existing global database in an easy and rapid way, a user-friendly website (https://db.cngb.org/HPTT/) was developed with both genomic typing tool and visualization tool. To further confirm the validity of the website, ten newly assembled genomes were downloaded and tested precisely located on the branch as we expected. In summary, H. pylori typing tool (HPTT) is a novel genomic epidemiological tool that can achieve high resolution analysis of genomic typing and visualizing simultaneously, providing insights into the genetic population structure analysis, evolution analysis and epidemiological surveillance of H. pylori.",

    "abstract": "Defensins are small proteins, usually ranging from 4 to 6 kDa, amphipathic, disulfide-rich, and with a small or even absent hydrophobic core. Since a hydrophobic core is generally found in globular proteins that fold in an aqueous solvent, the peculiar fold of defensins can challenge tertiary protein structure predictors. We performed a PDB-wide survey of small proteins (4-6 kDa) to understand the similarities of defensins with other small disulfide-rich proteins. We found no differences when we compared defensins with non-defensins regarding the proportion and exposition to the solvent of apolar, polar, and charged residues. Then we divided all small proteins (4-6 kDa) deposited in PDB into two groups, one group with at least one disulfide bond (bonded, defensins included) and another group without any disulfide bond (unbonded). The group of bonded proteins presented apolar residues more exposed to the solvent than the unbonded group. The ab initio algorithm for tertiary protein structure prediction Robetta was more accurate to predict unbonded than bonded proteins. Our work highlights one more layer of complexity for the tertiary protein prediction structure: small disulfide-rich proteins ability to fold even with a poor hydrophobic core.",

    "abstract": "CTCF is an architectonical protein that organizes the genome inside the cell nucleus in almost all eukaryotic cells. There is evidence that CTCF plays a critical role during spermatogenesis as its depletion produces abnormal sperm and infertility. However, the defects produced by the absence of CTCF throughout spermatogenesis have not been characterized. In this work, we performed single cell RNA sequencing in spermatogenic cells without CTCF. We uncovered defects in transcriptional programs that explain the severity of the damage in the produced sperm. At early stages of spermatogenesis, transcriptional alterations are mild. As germ cells go throughout the specialization stage or spermiogenesis, transcriptional profiles become more altered. We found spermatid defects that support the alterations in the transcriptional profiles, and thus we conclude that CTCF depletion alters several transcriptional profiles mostly during spermiogenesis. Our data highlights the importance of CTCF at the different stages of spermatogenesis.",

    "abstract": "DNA methylation profiles have been used to develop biomarkers of aging known as epigenetic clocks, which predict chronological age with remarkable accuracy and show promise for inferring health status as an indicator of biological age. Epigenetic clocks were first built to monitor human aging but the principles underpinning them appear to be evolutionarily conserved, as they have now been successfully developed for over 120 mammalian species. Here we describe reliable and highly accurate epigenetic clocks shown to apply to 51 domestic dog breeds. The methylation profiles were generated using a custom array with DNA sequences that are conserved across all mammalian species (HorvathMammalMethylChip40). Canine epigenetic clocks were constructed to estimate age and also predict mortality risk by estimating average time-to-death. We also present two highly accurate human-dog dual species epigenetic clocks (R=0.97), which may facilitate the ready translation from canine to human use (or vice versa) of anti-aging treatments being developed for longevity and preventive medicine. Finally, epigenome-wide association studies herein reveal individual methylation sites that may underlie the inverse relationship between breed weight and lifespan. Overall, we describe robust biomarkers to measure aging and potentially health status in canines.",

We inhibited Wnt ligand secretion in adult (5-mo) mice using a systemic (drug) and a bone-targeted (genetic) approach, and subjected them to axial tibial loading to induce lamellar bone formation. Mice treated with the porcupine inhibitor WNT974 exhibited a decrease in bone formation in non-loaded limbs as well as a 54% decline in the periosteal bone formation response to tibial loading. Similarly, within 1-2 weeks of Wls deletion in osteoblasts (Osx-CreERT2;WlsF/F mice), skeletal homeostasis was altered with decreased bone formation and increased resorption, and the anabolic response to loading was reduced 65% compared to control (WlsF/F). These findings establish a requirement for Wnt ligand secretion by osteoblasts for adult bone homeostasis and the anabolic response to mechanical loading.",

    "abstract": "In mammals, the X and Y chromosomes share only small regions of homology called pseudo-autosomal regions (PAR) where pairing and recombination in spermatocytes can occur. Consequently, the sex chromosomes remain largely unsynapsed during meiosis I and are sequestered in a nuclear compartment known as the XY body where they are transcriptionally silenced in a process called meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). MSCI mirrors meiotic silencing of unpaired chromatin (MSUC), the sequestration and transcriptional repression of unpaired DNA observed widely in eukaryotes. MSCI is initiated by the assembly of the axial elements of the synaptonemal complex (SC) comprising the structural proteins SYCP2 and SYCP3 followed by the ordered recruitment of DNA Damage Response (DDR) factors to effect gene silencing. However, the precise mechanism of how unsynapsed chromatin is detected in meiocytes is poorly understood. The sex chromosomes in eutherian mammals harbor multiple clusters of SYCP3-like amplicons comprising the Xlr gene family, only a handful of which have been functionally studied. We used a shRNA-transgenic mouse model to create a deficiency in the testis-expressed multicopy Xlr3 genes to investigate their role in spermatogenesis. Here we show that knockdown of Xlr3 in mice leads to spermatogenic defects and a skewed sex ratio that can be traced to MSCI breakdown. Spermatocytes deficient in XLR3 form the XY body and the SC axial elements therein, but are compromised in their ability to recruit DDR components to the XY body.\n\nAuthor SummaryA key event in the production of sperm is the pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosome pairs to facilitate genetic recombination during the first meiotic division. Chromosomal abnormalities that undermine pairing and synapsis in spermatocytes trigger a checkpoint that leads to removal of the abnormal cells via programmed cell death. In mammals, the sex chromosomes, X and Y, lack homology through most of their length and remain largely unpaired. To avoid triggering the checkpoint the X and Y are sequestered in a specialized nuclear compartment called the XY body. DNA damage response (DDR) proteins are recruited to the XY body in a highly ordered progression leading to repression of all gene transcription from the sex chromosomes. We show that knocking down expression of the X-linked SYCR3-like gene, Xlr3, disrupts sex chromosome gene silencing by interfering with recruitment of DDR factors, leading to compromised sperm production.",

    "abstract": "The blood brain barrier (BBB) forms a stringent barrier that protects the brain from components in the circulation that could interfere with neuronal function. At the same time, the BBB enables selective transport of critical nutrients and other chemicals to the brain. Many of these processes are still poorly understood. Beyond these functions, another recently recognized function is even less characterized, specifically the role of the BBB in modulating behavior by affecting neuronal function in a sex dependent manner. Notably, signaling in the adult Drosophila BBB is required for normal male courtship behavior. Courtship regulation also relies on male-specific molecules in the BBB. Our previous studies have demonstrated that adult feminization of these cells in males significantly lowered courtship. Here, we conducted microarray analysis of BBB cells isolated from males and females. Findings revealed that these cells contain male- and female-enriched transcripts, respectively. Among these transcripts, nuclear receptor DHR3/Hr46 was identified as a male-enriched BBB transcript. DHR3/Hr46 is best known for its essential roles in the ecdysone response during development and metamorphosis. In this study, we demonstrate that DR3/Hr46 is specifically required in the BBB cells of mature males for courtship behavior. The protein is localized in the nuclei of sub-perineurial glial cells (SPG), indicating that it might act as a transcriptional regulator. These data provide a catalogue of sexually dimorphic BBB transcripts and demonstrate a physiological adult role for the nuclear receptor DH3/Hr46 in the regulation of male courtship, a novel function that is independent of its developmental role.\n\nAuthor summaryThe blood brain barrier very tightly regulates which molecules can enter the brain. This is an important protection for the brain, however, it also complicates communication between molecules in the circulating fluid and the brain. In fly courtship, for example, circulating male-specific products are crucially required for normal courtship. But the neuronal circuits that ultimately control the behavior are inside the brain, separated from these molecules by the blood brain barrier. The mechanisms of this communication are not known. Here we show that the blood brain barrier itself contains sex-specific RNAs and we show that one of them, a nuclear receptor called DHR3, is required in adult males for normal courtship. These findings promise new insight into the communication between blood brain barrier and the brain.",

It is caused by genomic instability and phenotypic plasticity, but how these features co-evolve during tumour development remains unclear. SOX10 is a transcription factor, neural crest stem cell (NCSC) specifier and candidate mediator of cancer-associated phenotypic plasticity.\n\nMethodsUsing immunophenotyping, we investigated the expression of SOX10 in normal human breast tissue and breast cancer (n=21 cosmetic breast reduction and 1,860 tumour samples with clinical annotation). We then defined the context and evolution of its expression in TNBC compared to 21 other malignancies using systems-level transcriptomics.\n\nResultsSOX10 was detected in nuclei of normal mammary luminal progenitor cells, the histogenic origin of most TNBCs. In breast cancer, nuclear SOX10 predicted poor outcome amongst cross-sectional (log-rank p=0.0015, hazard ratio 2.02, n=224) and metaplastic (log-rank p=0.04, n=66) TNBCs. Systems-level transcriptional network analysis identified a core module in SOX10s normal mammary epithelial transcription program that is rewired to NCSC genes in TNBC. Reprogramming was proportional to DNA damage and genome-wide promoter hypomethylation, particularly at CpG island shores. Using a novel network analysis pipeline, we found that NCSC-like transcriptional reprogramming is also strongly associated with promoter hypomethylation in other SOX10+ malignancies: glioma and melanoma.\n\nConclusionsWe propose that cancer-associated genome hypomethylation simulates the open chromatin landscape of more primitive cell states, and that on this relatively unrestricted background, SOX10 recreates its ancestral gene regulatory circuits by default. These findings provide new insights about the basis of intratumoural heterogeneity and resurrection of developmental phenotypes in cancer; and highlight the potential for therapeutics that limit chromatin remodelling.",

We report that several key regulators of circadian gene expression are differentially expressed in uninjured spinal cord tissue of naive mice at Zeitgeber time 1 (ZT1) or ZT12, where ZT0 or ZT12 are times when lights are turned on or off, respectively. However, mice that received moderate, T9 contusive SCI at ZT0 or ZT12 showed similar recovery of locomotion as determined using the ladder walking test and the Basso mouse scale (BMS) over a 6 week post-injury period. Consistent with those findings, terminal histological analysis revealed no significant differences in white matter sparing at the injury epicenter. Therefore, locomotor recovery after thoracic contusive SCI is not affected by the time of day at which the neurotrauma occurred at least when comparing the beginning to the end of the mouse active period.",

    "abstract": "1The fate of mutations and the genetic load of populations depend on the relative importance of genetic drift and natural selection. In addition, the accuracy of numerical models of evolution depends on the strength of both selection and drift: strong selection breaks the assumptions of the nearly neutral model, and drift coupled with large sample sizes breaks Kingmans coalescent model.\n\nThus, the regime with strong selection and large sample sizes, relevant to the study of pathogenic variation, appears particularly daunting. Surprisingly, we find that the interplay of drift and selection in that regime can be used to define asymptotically closed recursions for the distribution of allele frequencies that are accurate well beyond the strong selection limit.\n\nSelection becomes more analytically tractable when the sample size n is larger than twice the population-scaled selection coefficient: n [&ge;] 2Ns (4Ns in diploids). That is, when the expected number of coalescent events in the sample is larger than the number of selective events. We construct the relevant transition matrices, show how they can be used to accurately compute distributions of allele frequencies, and show that the distribution of deleterious allele frequencies is sensitive to details of the evolutionary model.",
