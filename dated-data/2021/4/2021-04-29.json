    "abstract": "Goulds thought experiment of \"replaying lifes tape\" provides a conceptual framework for experiments that quantify the contributions of adaptation, chance, and history to evolutionary outcomes. For example, we can empirically measure how varying the depth of history in one environment influences subsequent evolution in a new environment. Can this \"footprint of history\"--the genomic legacy of prior adaptation--grow too deep to overcome? Can it constrain adaptation, even with intense selection in the new environment? We investigated these questions using digital organisms. Specifically, we evolved ten populations from one ancestor under identical conditions. We then replayed evolution from three time points in each populations history (corresponding to shallow, intermediate, and deep history) in two new environments (one similar and one dissimilar to the prior environment). We measured the contributions of adaptation, chance, and history to the among-lineage variation in fitness and genome length in both new environments. In both environments, variation in genome length depended largely on history and chance, not adaptation, indicating weak selection. By contrast, adaptation, chance, and history all contributed to variation in fitness. Crucially, whether the depth of history affected adaptation depended on the environment. When the ancestral and new environments overlapped, history was as important as adaptation to the fitness achieved in the new environment for the populations with the deepest history. However, when the ancestral and novel environments favored different traits, adaptation overwhelmed even deep history. This experimental design for assessing the influence of the depth of history is promising for both biological and digital systems.",

    "abstract": "Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) analyses have been widely used to identify genetic variants associated with gene expression levels to understand what molecular mechanisms underlie genetic traits. The resultant eQTLs might affect the expression of associated genes through transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. In this study, we attempt to distinguish these two types of regulation by identifying genetic variants associated with mRNA stability of genes (stQTLs). Specifically, we computationally inferred mRNA stability of genes based on RNA-seq data and performed association analysis to identify stQTLs. Using the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) lung RNA-Seq data, we identified a total of 142,801 stQTLs for 3,942 genes and 186,132 eQTLs for 4,751 genes from 15,122,700 genetic variants for 13,476 genes, respectively. Interesting, our results indicated that stQTLs were enriched in the CDS and 3UTR regions, while eQTLs are enriched in the CDS, 3UTR, 5UTR, and upstream regions. We also found that stQTLs are more likely than eQTLs to overlap with RNA binding protein (RBP) and microRNA (miRNA) binding sites. Our analyses demonstrate that simultaneous identification of stQTLs and eQTLs can provide more mechanistic insight on the association between genetic variants and gene expression levels.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the past decade, many studies have identified genetic variants associated with gene expression level (eQTLs) in different phenotypes, including tissues and diseases. Gene expression is the result of cooperation between transcriptional regulation, such as transcriptional activity, and post-transcriptional regulation, such as mRNA stability. Here, we present a computational framework that take advantage of recently developed methods to estimate mRNA stability from RNA-Seq, which is widely used to estimate gene expression, and then to identify genetic variants associated with mRNA stability (stQTLs) in lung tissue. Compared to eQTLs, we found that genetic variants that affects mRNA stability are more significantly located in the CDS and 3UTR regions, which are known to interact with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) or microRNAs to regulate stability. In addition, stQTLs are significantly more likely to overlap the binding sites of RBPs. We show that the six RBPs that most significantly bind to stQTLs are all known to regulate mRNA stability. This pipeline of simultaneously identifying eQTLs and stQTLs using only RNA-Seq data can provide higher resolution than traditional eQTLs study to better understand the molecular mechanisms of genetic variants on the regulation of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Identification of autophagic protein cargo in plants by their abundance in autophagy related genes (ATG) mutants is complicated by changes in both protein synthesis and protein degradation. To detect autophagic cargo, we measured protein degradation rate in shoots and roots of Arabidopsis atg5 and atg11 mutant plants. These data show that less than a quarter of proteins changing in abundance are probable cargo and revealed roles of ATG11 and ATG5 in degradation of specific cytosol, chloroplast and ER-resident proteins, and a specialized role for ATG11 in degradation of proteins from mitochondria and chloroplasts. Our data support a role for autophagy in degrading glycolytic enzymes and the chaperonin containing T-complex polypeptide-1 complex. Autophagy induction by Pi limitation changed metabolic profiles and the protein synthesis and degradation rates of atg5 and atg11 plants. A general decrease in the abundance of amino acids and increase in several secondary metabolites in autophagy mutants was consistent with altered catabolism and changes in energy conversion caused by reduced degradation rate of specific proteins. Combining measures of changes in protein abundance and degradation rates, we also identify ATG11 and ATG5 associated protein cargo of low Pi induced autophagy in chloroplasts and ER-resident proteins involved in secondary metabolism.\n\nSingle Sentence SummaryProtein cargo of autophagy in plants can be discovered by identifying proteins that increase in abundance and decrease in degradation rate in mutants deficient in autophagy machinery",

    "abstract": "Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is an adult-onset, progressive ataxia. SCA3 presents with ataxia before any gross neuropathology. A feature of many cerebellar ataxias is aberrant cerebellar output that contributes to motor dysfunction. We examined whether abnormal cerebellar output was present in the CMVMJD135 SCA3 mouse model and, if so, whether it correlated with the disease onset and progression. In vivo recordings showed that the activity of deep cerebellar nuclei neurons, the main output of the cerebellum, was altered. The aberrant activity correlated with the onset of ataxia. However, although the severity of ataxia increased with age, the severity of the aberrant cerebellar output was not progressive. The abnormal cerebellar output, however, was accompanied with non-progressive abnormal activity of their upstream synaptic inputs, the Purkinje cells. In vitro recordings indicated that alterations in both intrinsic Purkinje cell pacemaking and in their synaptic inputs contributed to abnormal Purkinje cell activity. These findings implicate abnormal cerebellar physiology as an early, consistent contributor to pathophysiology in SCA3, and suggest that the aberrant cerebellar output could be an appropriate therapeutic target in SCA3.\n\nSummary StatementIn a mouse model of Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 aberrant cerebellar physiology is apparent early in disease, before overt neuronal pathology or neuronal death.",

    "abstract": "Transposable elements (TEs) are self-replicating \"genetic parasites\" ubiquitous to eukaryotic genomes. In addition to conflict between TEs and their host genomes, TEs of the same family are in competition with each other. They compete for the same genomic niches while experiencing the same regime of copy-number selection. This suggests that competition among TEs may favor the emergence of new variants that can outcompete their ancestral forms. To investigate the sequence evolution of TEs, we developed a method to infer clades: collections of TEs that share SNP variants and represent distinct TE family lineages. We applied this method to a panel of 85 Drosophila melanogaster genomes and found that the genetic variation of several TE families shows significant population structure that arises from the population- specific expansions of single clades. We used population genetic theory to classify these clades into younger versus older clades and found that younger clades are associated with a greater abundance of sense and antisense piRNAs per copy than older ones. Further, we find that the abundance of younger, but not older clades, is positively correlated with antisense piRNA production, suggesting a general pattern where hosts preferentially produce antisense piRNAs from recently active TE variants. Together these findings suggest a pattern whereby new TE variants arise by mutation and then increase in copy number, followed by the host producing antisense piRNAs that may be used to silence these emerging variants.",
