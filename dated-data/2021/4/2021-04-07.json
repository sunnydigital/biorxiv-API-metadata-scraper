    "abstract": "The cost-benefit ratio of group-living is thought to vary with group size: individuals in \"optimally-sized\" groups should have higher fitness than individuals in groups that are either too large or too small. However, the relationship between group size and individual fitness has been difficult to establish for long-lived species where the number of groups studied is typically quite low. Here we present evidence for optimal group size that maximizes female fitness in a population of geladas (Theropithecus gelada). Drawing on 14 years of demographic data, we found that females in small groups experienced the highest death rates, while females in mid-sized units exhibited the highest reproductive performance. This group-size effect on female reproductive performance was largely explained by variation in infant mortality (and, in particular, by infanticide from immigrant males) but not by variation in reproductive rates. Taken together, females in mid-sized units are projected to attain optimal fitness due to conspecific infanticide and, potentially, predation. Our findings provide insight into how and why group size shapes fitness in long-lived species.",

    "abstract": "Recent advances in mass spectrometry technology have seen remarkable increases in proteomic sequencing speed, while improvements to dynamic range have remained limited. An exemplar of this is the new timsTOF Pro instrument, which thanks to its trapped ion mobility, pushes effective fragmentation rates beyond 100Hz and provides accurate CCS values as well as impressive sensitivity. Established data dependent methodologies underutilize these advances by relying on long analytical columns and extended LC gradients to achieve comprehensive proteome coverage from biological samples. Here we describe the implementation of methods for short packed emitter columns that fully utilize instrument speed and CCS values by combining rapid generation of deep peptide libraries with enhanced matching of single shot data dependent sample analysis. Impressively, with only a 17 minute separation gradient (50 samples per day), the combination of high performance chromatography and CCS enhanced library based matching resulted in an average of 5,931 protein identifications within individual samples, and 7,244 proteins cumulatively across replicates from HeLa cell tryptic digests. Additionally, an ultra-high throughput setup utilizing 5 min gradients (180 samples per day) yielded an average of 3,666 protein identifications within individual samples and 4,659 proteins cumulatively across replicates. These workflows are simple to implement on available technology and do not require complex software solutions or custom-made consumables to achieve high throughput and deep proteome analysis from biological samples.",

    "abstract": "Phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) is essential for plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Dimeric receptors are a class of ABA receptors that are important for various ABA responses. While extensive experimental and computational studies have investigated these receptors, it remains not fully understood how ABA leads to their activation and dissociation for interaction with downstream phosphatase. Here, we study the activation and the homodimeric association processes of PYL2 receptor as well as its heterodimeric association with the phosphatase HAB1 using molecular dynamics simulations. Free energy landscapes from ~223 s simulations show that dimerization substantially constrains PYL2 conformational plasticity and stabilizes inactive state, resulting in lower ABA affinity. Also, we establish the thermodynamic model for competitive binding between homodimeric PYL2 association and heterodimeric PYL2-HAB1 association in the absence and presence of ABA. Our results suggest that the binding of ABA destabilizes PYL2 complex and further stabilizes PYL2-HAB1 association, thereby promoting PYL2 dissociation. Overall, this study explains several key aspects on activation of dimeric ABA receptors, which provide new avenues for selective regulation of these receptors.",

    "abstract": "The microtubules of the mitotic spindle mediate chromosome alignment to the metaphase plate, then sister chromatid segregation to the spindle poles in anaphase. Previous analyses of spindle microtubule kinetics utilizing fluorescence dissipation after photoactivation described two main populations, a slow and a fast turnover population, and these were ascribed to reflect kinetochore versus non-kinetochore microtubules, respectively. Here, we test this categorization by disrupting kinetochores through depletion of the Ndc80 complex. In the absence of functional kinetochores, microtubule dynamics still exhibit slow and fast turnover populations, though the proportion of each population and the timings of turnover are altered. Importantly, the data obtained following Hec1/Ndc80 depletion suggests other sub-populations, in addition to kinetochore microtubules, contribute to the slow turnover population. Further manipulation of spindle microtubules revealed a complex landscape. Dissection of the dynamics of microtubule populations provides a greater understanding of mitotic spindle kinetics and insight into roles in facilitating chromosome attachment, movement, and segregation during mitosis.",

    "abstract": "Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat to global health. Evidence for this trend is generated in microbiological laboratories through testing microorganisms for resistance against antimicrobial agents. International standards and guidelines are in place for this process as well as for reporting data on (inter-)national levels. However, there is a gap in the availability of standardized and reproducible tools for working with laboratory data to produce the required reports. It is known that extensive efforts in data cleaning and validation are required when working with data from laboratory information systems. Furthermore, the global spread and relevance of antimicrobial resistance demands to incorporate international reference data in the analysis process.\n\nIn this paper, we introduce the AMR package for R that aims at closing this gap by providing tools to simplify antimicrobial resistance data cleaning and analysis, while incorporating international guidelines and scientifically reliable reference data. The AMR package enables standardized and reproducible antimicrobial resistance analyses, including the application of evidence-based rules, determination of first isolates, translation of various codes for microorganisms and antimicrobial agents, determination of (multi-drug) resistant microorganisms, and calculation of antimicrobial resistance, prevalence and future trends. The AMR package works independently of any laboratory information system and provides several functions to integrate into international workflows (e.g., WHONET software provided by the World Health Organization).",

This is an important question in the tundra where vegetation shifts are occurring across the entire biome, and where soil organic carbon stocks are large and vulnerable to environmental change.\nC_LIO_LITo study how traits affect carbon cycling in the tundra, we built a model that explained carbon cycling (above-ground and soil organic carbon stocks, and photosynthetic and respiratory fluxes) with abiotic conditions (air temperature and soil moisture), plant community functional composition (average plant height, leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA)), and functional diversity (weighted standard deviations of the traits). Data was collected from an observational study setting from northern Finland.\nC_LIO_LIThe explanatory power of the models was relatively high, but a large part of variation in soil organic carbon stocks remained unexplained. Plant height was the strongest predictor of all carbon cycling variables except soil carbon stocks. Communities of larger plants were associated with larger CO2 fluxes and above-ground carbon stocks. Communities with fast leaf economics (i.e. high SLA and low LDMC) had higher photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, and soil organic carbon stocks.\nC_LIO_LIWithin-community variability in plant height, SLA, and LDMC affected ecosystem functions differently. SLA and LDMC diversity increased CO2 fluxes and soil organic carbon stocks, while height diversity increased the above-ground carbon stock. The contributions of functional diversity metrics to ecosystem functioning were about as important as those of average SLA and LDMC traits.\nC_LIO_LISynthesis: Plant height, SLA, and LDMC have clear effects on tundra carbon cycling. The importance of functional diversity highlights a potentially important mechanism controlling the vast tundra carbon pools that should be better recognized. More research on root traits and decomposer communities is needed to understand the below-ground mechanisms regulating carbon cycling in the tundra.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Melanoma and most other cancers occur more frequently, and have worse prognosis, in males compared with females. Though sex steroids are thought to be involved, classical androgen and estrogen receptors are not detectable in most melanomas. Here we show that testosterone promotes melanoma proliferation by activating ZIP9 (SLC39A9), a zinc transporter that is not intentionally targeted by available therapeutics, but is widely expressed in human melanoma. This testosterone activity requires zinc influx, MAPK activation and YAP1 nuclear translocation. We demonstrate that FDA approved inhibitors of the classical androgen receptor also inhibit ZIP9, and thereby antagonize the pro-tumorigenic effects of testosterone in melanoma. In male mice, androgen receptor inhibitors suppressed growth of ZIP9-expressing melanomas, but had no effect on isogenic melanomas lacking ZIP9, nor on melanomas in females. These data suggest that ZIP9 might be effectively targeted in melanoma and other cancers by repurposing androgen receptor inhibitors that are currently approved only for prostate cancer.\n\nSignificanceMelanoma outcomes are worse in males than in females. Some of this difference is driven by testosterone signaling through ZIP9, a nonclassical testosterone receptor. Drugs that target AR can be repurposed to block ZIP9, and inhibit melanoma in males.",

    "abstract": "Studies of personality traits in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) indicate that there are five or six constructs--sociability, dominance, neuroticism, openness, and two related to conscientiousness--that define personality in common marmosets. The present study attempted to determine whether our earlier study of laboratory-housed individuals only yielded three domains--Dominance, Sociability, and Neuroticism--because of a low amount of between-subjects variance. We therefore increased our sample size from 77 to 128. In addition, we ascertained the reliability and validity of ratings and whether polymorphisms related to the serotonin 1a receptor were associated with personality. We found Sociability, Dominance, and Negative Affect factors that resembled three domains found in previous studies, including ours. We also found an Openness and Impulsiveness factor, the latter of which bore some resemblance to Conscientiousness, and two higher-order factors, Pro-sociality and Boldness. Further analyses could not exclude the possibility that Pro-sociality and Boldness represented a higher-level of personality organization. Correlations between personality factors and well-being were consistent with the definitions of the factors. There were no significant associations between personality and genotype. These results are consistent with the possibility that common marmoset personality structure varies as a function of rearing or housing variables that have not yet been investigated systematically.",

We also provide evidence that the post-translational modification of serine 345 in Kcnk5b by calcineurin regulates channel activity to scale the fin.

Extensive molecular studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum fructicola is the dominant pathogen of oil tea anthracnose in China. The study aims to investigate differences in molecular processes and regulatory genes at different stages of infection of C. fructicola, to aide in understanding differences in pathogenic mechanisms of C. fructicola of different geographic populations. Materials and Methods: We compared the pathogenicity of C. fructicola from different populations (Wuzhishan, Hainan province and Shaoyang, Hunan province), and gene expression of representative strains of the two populations before and after inoculation in oil tea using RNA sequencing. In results we found that C. fructicola from Wuzhishan has a stronger ability to infect and impact oil tea leaf tissue. Up-regulated genes in oil tea following infection with the two geographic populations were associated with a number of ribosome-related GO terms and ribosome metabolic related KEGG pathways, and were significantly enriched in galactosidase activity, glutamine family amino acid metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism. In addition, up-regulated gene lists associated with infection in the Wuzhishan strains were significantly enriched purine metabolism pathways as well, while Shaoyang strains were not significantly enriched in these processes. Differences in gene expression were indicative of greater active transcription and translation in the Wuzhishan population while more active glycoprotein metabolism was observed following inoculation with strains from Shaoyang. These results indicate that C. fructicola obtained sugars and amino acids from oil tea tissue to resist host immune pressure. Moreover, more active in transcriptional and translational activity and the greater regulation of purine metabolism pathway in the Wuzhishan strain might contribute to its stronger pathogenicity.",

    "abstract": "Inhibitory control is the ability to suppress inappropriate movements and unwanted actions, allowing to regulate impulses and responses. This ability can be measured via the Stop Signal Task, which provides a temporal index of response inhibition, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). At the neural level, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) allows to investigate of motor inhibition within the primary motor cortex (M1), such as the Cortical Silent period (CSP). CSPs length is an index of GABAB-mediated intracortical inhibition within M1. Although there is strong evidence that intracortical inhibition varies during action stopping, it is still not clear whether differences in the neurophysiological markers of intracortical inhibition contribute to behavioral differences in actual inhibitory capacities. Hence, we here explored the relationship between intracortical inhibition within M1 and behavioral response inhibition. GABABergic-mediated inhibition in M1 was determined by the length of CSP, while behavioral inhibition was assessed by the SSRT. We found a significant positive correlation between CSPs length and SSRT, namely that individuals with greater levels of GABABergic-mediated inhibition seem to perform overall worse in inhibiting behavioral responses. These results support the assumption that individual differences in intracortical inhibition are mirrored by individual differences in action stopping abilities.",

In particular, it is unknown whether they operate at similar timescales, and whether they support different cognitive processes. We recorded EEG in 30 healthy human participants while they performed a learning task containing both novel (block-unique) and repeating stimuli. We investigated behavior and electrophysiology at both fast (i.e., within blocks) and slow (i.e., between blocks) time scales. Behaviorally, both response time and accuracy improved (resp. decrease and increase) over both fast and slow timescales. However, on the spectral level, theta power significantly decreased along the slow timescale, whereas alpha power instead significantly increased along the fast timescale. We thus demonstrate that theta and alpha both play a role during learning, but operate at different timescales.

    "abstract": "Dysregulated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity is associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders ranging from idiopathic autism spectrum disorders to syndromes caused by single gene defects. This suggests that maintaining mTOR activity levels in a physiological range is essential for brain development and functioning. Upon activation, mTOR regulates a variety of cellular processes such as cell growth, autophagy and metabolism. On a molecular level, however, the consequences of mTOR activation in the brain are not well understood.\n\nLow levels of cholesterol are associated with a wide variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. We here describe numerous genes of the sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis pathway to be transcriptionally regulated by mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in vitro in primary neurons and in vivo in the developing cerebral cortex of the mouse. We find that these genes are shared targets of the transcription factors SREBP, SP1 and NF-Y. Prenatal as well as postnatal mTORC1 inhibition downregulated expression of these genes which directly translated into reduced cholesterol levels pointing towards a substantial metabolic function of the mTORC1 signaling cascade. Altogether, our results indicate that mTORC1 is an essential transcriptional regulator of the expression of sterol/cholesterol biosynthesis genes in the developing brain. Altered expression of these genes may be an important factor contributing to the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with dysregulated mTOR signaling.",

Proper regulation of aNPC fate entails important implications for brain plasticity and healthy aging. Piwi proteins and the small noncoding RNAs interacting with them (piRNAs) are best known in gonads as repressors of transposons. Here, we show that Piwil2 (Mili) and piRNAs are abundant in aNPCs of the postnatal mouse hippocampus and demonstrate that this pathway is essential for proper neurogenesis. Particularly, depleting the piRNA pathway in aNPCs impaired neurogenesis, increased senescence and accordingly the generation of reactive glia. Moreover, this manipulation primarily elevated 5S ribosomal RNA, SINEB1 and mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and regulators of translation, resulting in higher polysome density and protein synthesis upon differentiation. Our results provide evidence of an essential role for the piRNA pathway in maintaining homeostasis to sustain neural stem cell fate, underpinning its possible involvement in brain plasticity and successful aging.",

    "abstract": "Although the cerebellum is now recognized as part of a long-range brain network that serves limbic functions and motivated behavior, knowledge of cerebello-limbic connectivity is limited, and nothing is known about how the cerebellum connects functionally to the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Here, we report that stimulation of cerebellar nuclei in mice of both sexes modulates spiking activity in both NAc core and medial shell with fast excitation and slower, less synchronized inhibition. Fast responses would be well poised to support rapid communication of information critical to the control of motivated behavior, whereas slower responses may be suggestive of a regulatory function, such as gain control. Tracing experiments to chart cerebellar nuclei-NAc pathways identified disynaptic pathways that recruit the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and intralaminar thalamus (Centromedial and Parafascicular nuclei) as intermediary nodes. Optogenetic activation of cerebellar axons in each of these nodes was sufficient to evoke responses in both NAc core and medial shell, albeit with distinct, node-dependent properties. These pathways and the functional connectivity they support could underlie the role of the cerebellum in motivated behavior.",

    "abstract": "Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant and potent neurotoxin that bioaccumulates in food webs as monomethylmercury (MeHg). The production of MeHg is driven by anaerobic and Hg redox cycling pathways such as Hg reduction, which control the availability of Hg to methylators. Anaerobes play an important role in Hg reduction in methylation hotspots, yet their contributions remain underappreciated due to how challenging these pathways are to study in the absence of dedicated genetic targets and low levels of Hg0 in anoxic environments. In this study we used Hg stable isotope fractionation to explore Hg reduction during anoxygenic photosynthesis and fermentation in the model anaerobe Heliobacterium modesticaldum Ice1. We show that cells preferentially reduce lighter Hg isotopes in both metabolisms leading to mass-dependent fractionation, but mass-independent fractionation commonly induced by UV-visible light is absent. We show that isotope fractionation is affected by the interplay between pathways controlling Hg recruitment, accessibility, and availability alongside metabolic redox reactions. The combined contributions of these processes lead to isotopic enrichment during anoxygenic photosynthesis that is in between the values reported for anaerobic respiratory microbial Hg reduction and abiotic photoreduction. Isotope enrichment during fermentation is closer to what has been observed in aerobic bacteria that reduce Hg through dedicated detoxification pathways. These results demonstrate that common controls exist at the atomic level for Hg reduction during photosynthesis and fermentation in H. modesticaldum. Our work suggests that similar controls likely underpin diverse microbe-mediated Hg transformations that affect Hgs fate in oxic and anoxic habitats.\n\nIMPORTANCEAnaerobic and photosynthetic bacteria that reduce mercury affect mercury delivery to microbes in methylation sites that drive bioaccumulation in food webs. Anaerobic mercury reduction pathways remain underappreciated in the current view of the global mercury cycle because they are challenging to study, bearing no dedicated genetic targets to establish physiological mechanisms. In this study we used stable isotopes to show that common physiological processes control mercury reduction during photosynthesis and fermentation in the model anaerobe Heliobacterium modesticaldum Ice1. The sensitivity of isotope analyses highlighted the subtle contribution of mercury uptake towards the isotope signature associated with anaerobic mercury reduction. When considered alongside the isotope signatures associated with microbial pathways for which genetic determinants have been identified, our findings underscore the narrow range of isotope enrichment that is characteristic of microbial mercury transformations. This suggests that there exist common atomic-level controls for biological mercury transformations across a broad range of geochemical conditions.",

    "abstract": "Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), applied to two brain sites with different phase lags, has been shown to modulate stimulation-outlasting functional EEG connectivity between the targeted regions. Given the lack of knowledge on mechanisms of tACS aftereffects, it is difficult to further enhance effect sizes and reduce variability in experiments. In this computational study, we tested if spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) can explain stimulation-outlasting connectivity modulation by dual-site tACS and explored the effects of tACS parameter choices. Two populations of spiking neurons were coupled with synapses subject to STDP, and results were validated via a re-analysis of EEG data. Our simulations showed stimulation-outlasting connectivity changes between in- and anti-phase tACS, dependent on both tACS frequency and synaptic conduction delays. Importantly, both a simple network entraining to a wide range of tACS frequencies as well as a more realistic network that spontaneously oscillated at alpha frequency predicted that the largest effects would occur for short conduction delays between the stimulated regions. This finding agreed with experimental EEG connectivity modulation by 10 Hz tACS, showing a clear negative correlation of tACS effects with estimated conduction delays between regions. In conclusion, STDP can explain connectivity aftereffects of dual-site tACS. However, not all combinations of tACS frequency and application sites are expected to effectively modulate connectivity via STDP. We therefore suggest using appropriate computational models and/or EEG analysis for planning and interpretation of dual-site tACS studies relying on aftereffects.\n\nHighlightsO_LINetwork model with STDP explains EEG connectivity change after dual-site tACS\nC_LIO_LIEffects are predicted to depend on tACS frequency and conduction delays\nC_LIO_LIEEG data confirm dependence on conduction delays between regions\nC_LIO_LIModel can be used to estimate and maximize experimental effects\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Cyanobacteria thrive in very diverse environments. However, questions remain about possible growth limitations in ancient environmental conditions. As a single genus, the Thermosynechococcus are cosmopolitan and live in chemically diverse habitats. To understand the genetic basis for this, we compared the protein coding component of Thermosynechococcus genomes. Supplementing the known genetic diversity of Thermosynechococcus, we report draft metagenome-assembled genomes of two Thermosynechococcus recovered from ferrous carbonate hot springs in Japan. We find that as a genus, Thermosynechococcus is genomically conserved, having a small pan-genome with few accessory genes per individual strain and only 14 putative orthologous protein groups appearing in all Thermosynechococcus but not in any other cyanobacteria in our analysis. Furthermore, by comparing orthologous protein groups, including an analysis of genes encoding proteins with an iron related function (uptake, storage or utilization), no clear differences in genetic content, or adaptive mechanisms could be detected between genus members, despite the range of environments they inhabit. Overall, our results highlight a seemingly innate ability for Thermosynechococcus to inhabit diverse habitats without having undergone substantial genomic adaptation to accommodate this. The finding of Thermosynechococcus in both hot and high iron environments without adaptation recognizable from the perspective of the proteome has implications for understanding the basis of thermophily within this clade, and also for understanding the possible genetic basis for high iron tolerance in cyanobacteria on early Earth. The conserved core genome may be indicative of an allopatric lifestyle - or reduced genetic complexity of hot spring habitats relative to other environments.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has become one of the most powerful tools for investigating the human brain. However, virtually all fMRI studies have relatively poor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Here we introduce a novel fMRI denoising technique, which suppresses noise that is indistinguishable from zero-mean, Gaussian-distributed noise. Thermal noise, falling in this category, is a major source of noise in fMRI, particularly, but not exclusively, at high spatial and/or temporal resolutions. Using 7-Tesla high-resolution data, we demonstrate improvements in temporal-SNR, the detection of stimulus-induced signal changes, and functional maps, while leaving stimulus-induced signal change amplitudes, image spatial precision, and functional point-spread-function unaltered. We also show that the method is equally applicable when using supra-millimeter resolution 3- and 7-Tesla fMRI data, different cortical regions, stimulation/task paradigms, and acquisition strategies. This denoising approach improves key metrics of functional activation detection while preserving spatial precision.",

There is no evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS), and the only Nash equilibrium (NE) is unstable: strategies similar to the NE can always invade. But in spite of this instability, the NE is predictive. If harvesting attempts are costly or there are many competitors, the process tends to remain near the unstable NE. In this case, the resource often goes unharvested. Harvesting attempts--when they happen at all--usually occur when the resource is barely ripe enough to offset costs. The more foragers there are, the lower the chance that the resource will be harvested and the greater its mean value when harvested. This counterintuitive behavior is exhibited not only by theoretical models and computer simulations, but also by human subjects in an experimental game.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial metabolism is of central importance to diverse aspects of cell and developmental biology. Defects in mitochondria are associated with many diseases, including cancer, neuropathology, and infertility. Our understanding of mitochondrial metabolism in situ and dysfunction in diseases are limited by the lack of techniques to measure mitochondrial metabolic fluxes with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution. Herein, we developed a new method to infer mitochondrial metabolic fluxes in living cells with subcellular resolution from fluorescence lifetime imaging of NADH. This result is based on the use of a generic coarse-grained NADH redox model. We tested the model in mouse oocytes and human tissue culture cells subject to a wide variety of perturbations by comparing predicted fluxes through the electron transport chain (ETC) to direct measurements of oxygen consumption rate. Interpreting the FLIM measurements of NADH using this model, we discovered a homeostasis of ETC flux in mouse oocytes: perturbations of nutrient supply and energy demand do not change ETC flux despite significantly impacting NADH metabolic state. Furthermore, we observed a subcellular spatial gradient of ETC flux in mouse oocytes and found that this gradient is primarily a result of heterogeneous mitochondrial proton leak. We concluded from these observations that ETC flux in mouse oocytes is not controlled by energy demand or supply, but by the intrinsic rates of mitochondrial respiration.",

While synchrony to regular (isochronous) rhythms is well documented, synchrony to non-isochronous stimuli, with multiple components at unequal time intervals, is rarer. Several katydid species with isochronous calls have been shown to achieve synchrony as part of their natural calling interactions in multi-individual choruses. Yet no study so far has demonstrated synchrony in any insect with a non-isochronous call. Using natural calling behaviour and playback experiments, we investigated acoustic synchrony and the mechanisms underlying it in the katydid species Mecopoda  Two Part Caller. This species has a complex non-isochronous call consisting of a long trill followed by two or more chirps. We found that individual males synchronized trills and, to a lesser extent, chirps. Further investigation of trill synchrony showed that timing of trills is modified by external trills but not chirps. Chirp synchrony is modified by external chirps but also by trills. We suggest a two-oscillator model underlying synchrony in this species and discuss the implications for the evolution of acoustic synchrony.",

We report a total of 2,657 robustly expressed lncRNAs across six pediatric cancers, including 1,142 exhibiting histotype-specific expression. DNA copy number alterations contributed to lncRNA dysregulation at a proportion comparable to protein coding genes. Application of a multi-dimensional framework to identify and prioritize lncRNAs impacting gene networks revealed that lncRNAs dysregulated in pediatric cancer are associated with proliferation, metabolism, and DNA damage hallmarks. Analysis of upstream regulation via cell-type specific transcription factors further implicated distinct histotype-specific and developmental lncRNAs. We integrated our analyses to prioritize lncRNAs for experimental validation and showed that silencing of TBX2-AS1, our top-prioritized neuroblastoma-specific lncRNA, resulted in significant growth inhibition of neuroblastoma cells, confirming our computational predictions.

Animal studies have suggested that the hippocampus plays an essential role in duration memory; however, the memory processes involved are unclear. To clarify the role of the dorsal hippocampus in the acquisition of long-term duration memories, we adapted the \"time-shift paradigm\" to a peak-interval procedure. After a sufficient number of training with an initial target duration (20 s), the rats underwent \"shift sessions\" with a new target duration (40 s) under a muscimol (0.5 g per side) infusion into the bilateral dorsal hippocampus. The memory of the new target duration was then tested in drug-free \"probe sessions,\" including trials in which no lever presses were reinforced. In the probe sessions, the mean response rate distribution of the muscimol group was located leftward to the control group, but these two response rate distributions were superimposed on the standardized time axis, suggesting a scalar property. In the session-by-session analysis, the mean peak time (an index of timing accuracy) of the muscimol group was lower than that of the control group in the probe sessions, but not in the shift sessions. These findings suggest that the dorsal hippocampus is required for the formation of long-term duration memories within the range of interval timing.",

Yet, experimental evidence linking the mating system to evolved sexual dimorphism in immunity are scarce and the direct effects of mating rate on immunity are not well established. Here, we use transcriptomic analyses, experimental evolution and phylogenetic comparative methods to study the association between the mating system and sexual dimorphism in immunity in seed beetles, where mating causes internal injuries in females.\n\nResultsWe demonstrate that female phenoloxidase (PO) activity, involved in wound healing and defence against parasitic infections, is elevated relative to males. This difference is accompanied by concomitant sex-differences in the expression of genes in the pro-phenoloxidase activating cascade. We document substantial phenotypic plasticity in female PO activity in response to mating and show that experimental evolution under enforced monogamy (resulting in low remating rates and sexual conflict relative to natural polygamy) rapidly decreases female (but not male) PO activity. Moreover, monogamous females have evolved increased tolerance to bacterial infection unrelated to mating, implying that female responses to costly mating may trade off with other aspects of immune defence, an hypothesis which broadly accords with the documented sex differences in gene expression. Finally, female (but not male) PO activity shows correlated evolution with the perceived harmfulness of male genitalia across 12 species of seed beetles, suggesting that sexual conflict has a significant influence on sexual dimorphisms in immunity in this group of insects.\n\nConclusionsOur study provides insights into the links between sexual conflict and sexual dimorphism in immunity at the molecular and phenotypic level and suggests that selection pressures moulded by mating interactions can lead to a sex-specific mosaic of immune responses with important implications for host-pathogen dynamics in sexually reproducing organisms.",

However, accurate prediction of cell fates, and thereby biologically meaningful discovery, is challenged by the sheer size of single-cell data, the diversity of omic data types, and the complexity of their topologies. We present VIA, a scalable trajectory inference algorithm that overcomes these limitations by using lazy-teleporting random walks to accurately reconstruct complex cellular trajectories beyond tree-like pathways (e.g. cyclic or disconnected structures). We show that VIA robustly and efficiently unravels the fine-grained sub-trajectories in a 1.3-million-cell transcriptomic mouse atlas without losing the global connectivity at such a high cell count. We further apply VIA to discovering elusive lineages and less populous cell fates missed by other methods across a variety of data types, including single-cell proteomic, epigenomic, multi-omics datasets, and a new in-house single-cell morphological dataset.",

    "abstract": "Insecticide resistance provides both an increasingly pressing threat to the control of vector-borne diseases and insights into the remarkable capacity of natural populations to show rapid evolutionary responses to contemporary selection. Malaria control remains heavily dependent on deployment of pyrethroid insecticides, primarily in long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), but resistance in the major malaria vectors has increased over the last 15 years in concert with dramatic expansion of LLIN distributions. Identifying genetic mechanisms underlying high-level resistance in mosquitoes, which may almost entirely overcome pyrethroid efficacy, is crucial for the development and deployment of potentially resistance-breaking tools. Using the Anopheles gambiae 1000 genomes (Ag1000g) data we identified a very recent selective sweep in mosquitoes from Uganda which localized to a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes, including some commonly implicated in resistance. Further interrogation revealed a haplotype involving a trio of mutations, a nonsynonymous point mutation in Cyp6p4 (I236M), an upstream insertion of a partial Zanzibar-like transposable element (TE) and a duplication of the Cyp6aa1 gene. The mutations appear to have originated recently in An. gambiae from the Kenya-Uganda border region around Lake Victoria, with stepwise replacement of the double-mutant (Zanzibar-like TE and Cyp6p4-236M) with the triple-mutant haplotype (including Cyp6aa1 duplication), which has spread into the Democratic Republic of Congo and Tanzania. The triple-mutant haplotype is strongly associated with increased expression of genes able to metabolise pyrethroids and is strongly predictive of resistance to pyrethroids most notably deltamethrin, a commonly-used LLIN insecticide. Importantly, there was increased mortality in mosquitoes carrying the triple-mutation when exposed to nets co-treated with the synergist piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Frequencies of the triple-mutant haplotype remain spatially variable within countries, suggesting an effective marker system to guide deployment decisions for limited supplies of PBO-pyrethroid co-treated LLINs across African countries. Duplications of the Cyp6aa1 gene are common in An. gambiae across Africa and, given the enzymes metabolic activity, are likely to be a useful diagnostic for high levels of pyrethroid resistance.",

    "abstract": "Malaria begins when mosquito-borne Plasmodium sporozoites invade hepatocytes and usurp host pathways to support the differentiation and multiplication of erythrocyte-infective merozoite progeny. The deadliest complication of infection, cerebral malaria, accounts for the majority of malarial fatalities. Although our understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathology remains incomplete, recent studies support the contribution of systemic and neuroinflammation as the cause of cerebral edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. All Plasmodium species encode an orthologue of the innate cytokine, Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), which functions in mammalian biology to regulate innate responses. Plasmodium MIF (PMIF) similarly signals through the host MIF receptor CD74, leading to an enhanced inflammatory response. We investigated the PMIF-CD74 interaction in the onset of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM) using CD74 deficient (Cd74-/-) mice, which were found to be protected from ECM. The protection was associated with the inability of brain microvessels from Cd74-/- hosts to present parasite antigen to sequestered Plasmodium-specific CD8+ T cells. Infection of mice with PMIF-deficient sporozoites (PbAmif-) also protected mice from ECM, highlighting the pivotal role of PMIF in the pre-erythrocytic stage of the infection. A novel pharmacologic PMIF-selective antagonist reduced PMIF/CD74 signaling and fully protected mice from ECM. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism for Plasmodium usurpation of host CD74 signaling and suggest a tractable approach for new pharmacologic intervention.",

    "abstract": "Multimeric protein complexes are molecular apparatuses to regulate biological systems and often determine their fate. Among proteins forming such molecular assemblies, amyloid proteins have drawn attention over a half-century since amyloid fibril formation of these proteins is supposed to be a common pathogenic cause for neurodegenerative diseases. This process is triggered by the accumulation of fibril-like aggregates, while the microscopic mechanisms are mostly elusive due to technical limitation of experimental methodologies in individually observing each of diverse aggregate species in the aqueous solution. We then addressed this problem by employing atomistic molecular dynamics simulations for the paradigmatic amyloid protein, amyloid-{beta} (1-42) (A{beta}42). Seven different dimeric forms of oligomeric A{beta}42 fibril-like aggregate in aqueous solution, ranging from tetramer to decamer, were considered. We found additive effects of the size of these fibril-like aggregates on their thermodynamic stability and have clarified kinetic suppression of protomer-protomer dissociation reactions at and beyond the point of pentamer dimer formation. This observation was obtained from the specific combination of the A{beta}42 protomer structure and the physicochemical condition that we here examined, while it is worthwhile to recall that several amyloid fibrils take dimeric forms of their protomers. We could thus conclude that the stable formation of fibril-like protomer dimer should be involved in a turning point where rapid growth of amyloid fibrils is triggered.",

    "abstract": "Cellular diversity supports the computational capacity and flexibility of cortical circuits. Accordingly, principal neurons at the CA1 output node of the hippocampus are increasingly recognized as a heterogeneous population. Their genes, molecular content, intrinsic morpho-physiology, connectivity, and function seem to segregate along the main anatomical axes of the hippocampus. Since these axes reflect the temporal order of principal cell neurogenesis, we directly examined the relationship between birthdate and CA1 pyramidal neuron diversity, focusing on the ventral hippocampus. We used a genetic fate-mapping approach that allowed tagging three groups of agematched principal neurons: pioneer, early- and late-born. Using a combination of neuroanatomy, slice physiology, connectivity tracing and cFos staining, we show that birthdate is a strong predictor of CA1 principal cell diversity. We unravel a subpopulation of pioneer neurons recruited in familiar environments with remarkable positioning, morpho-physiological features, and connectivity. Therefore, despite the expected plasticity of hippocampal circuits, given their role in learning and memory, the diversity of their main components is significantly predetermined at the earliest steps of development.",

Here we studied the function of Tregs during oral cancer development in aging mucosa. First, we found heightened proportions of Tregs and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) accumulating in mouse and human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues. Using the mouse 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide(4-NQO) oral carcinogenesis model, we found that tongues of aged mice displayed increased propensity for epithelial cell dysplasia, hyperplasia, and accelerated OSCC development, which coincided with significantly increased abundance of IL-1{beta}, Tregs, and MDSC in tongues. Partial depletion of Tregs reduced tumor burden. Moreover, fungal abundance and dectin-1 signaling were elevated in aged mice suggesting a potential role for dectin-1 in modulating immune environment and tumor development. Confirming this tenet, dectin-1 deficient mice showed diminished IL-1{beta}, reduced infiltration of Tregs and MDSC in the tongues, as well as slower progression and reduced severity of tumor burden. Taken together, these data identify an important role of dectin-1 signaling in establishing the intra-tumoral immunosuppressive milieu and promoting OSCC tumorigenesis in the context of aging.",

While random movement can be explained by basal intrinsic activity, persistent movement requires stable polarization. Here, we quantitatively address emergence of persistent migration in RPE1 cells over long timescales. By live-cell imaging and dynamic micropatterning, we demonstrate that the Nucleus-Golgi axis aligns with direction of migration leading to efficient cell movement. We show that polarized trafficking is directed towards protrusions with a 20 min delay, and that migration becomes random after disrupting internal cell organization. Eventually, we prove that localized optogenetic Cdc42 activation orients the Nucleus-Golgi axis. Our work suggests that polarized trafficking stabilizes the protrusive activity of the cell, while protrusive activity orients this polarity axis, leading to persistent cell migration. Using a minimal physical model, we show that this feedback is sufficient to recapitulate the quantitative properties of cell migration in the timescale of hours.",

Gastrointestinal hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is being explored as a potential therapy as activation of brain GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) exerts neuroprotection and controls peripheral metabolism. Intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (STZ-icv) is used to model IRBS and GLP-1 dyshomeostasis seems to be involved in the development of neuropathological changes. The aim was to explore i) gastrointestinal homeostasis in the STZ-icv model ii) assess whether the brain GLP-1 is involved in the regulation of gastrointestinal redox homeostasis and iii) analyze whether brain-gut GLP-1 axis is functional in the STZ-icv animals. Acute intracerebroventricular treatment with exendin-3(9-39)amide was used for pharmacological inhibition of brain GLP-1R in the control and STZ-icv rats, and oxidative stress was assessed in plasma, duodenum and ileum. Acute inhibition of brain GLP-1R increased plasma oxidative stress. TBARS were increased, and LMWT, SH, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were decreased in the duodenum, but not in the ileum of the controls. In the STZ-icv, TBARS and CAT were increased, LMWT and SH were decreased at baseline, and no further increment of oxidative stress was observed upon central GLP-1R inhibition. The presented results indicate that i) oxidative stress is increased in the duodenum of the STZ-icv rat model of AD, ii) brain GLP-1R signaling is involved in systemic redox regulation, iii) brain-gut GLP-1 axis regulates duodenal, but not ileal redox homeostasis, and iv) brain-gut GLP-1 axis is dysfunctional in the STZ-icv model.",

    "abstract": "The fish pathogen Aliivibrio (Vibrio) salmonicida LFI1238 is thought to be incapable of utilizing chitin as a nutrient source since approximately half of the genes representing the chitinolytic pathway are disrupted by insertion sequences. In the present study, we combined a broad set of analytical methods to investigate this hypothesis. Cultivation studies revealed that Al. salmonicida grew efficiently on N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and chitobiose ((GlcNAc)2), the primary soluble products resulting from enzymatic chitin hydrolysis. The bacterium was also able to grow on chitin particles, albeit at a lower rate compared to the soluble substrates. The genome of the bacterium contains five disrupted chitinase genes (pseudogenes) and three intact genes encoding a glycoside hydrolase family 18 (GH18) chitinase and two auxiliary activity family 10 (AA10) lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs). Biochemical characterization showed that the chitinase and LPMOs were able to depolymerize both - and {beta}-chitin to (GlcNAc)2 and oxidized chitooligosaccharides, respectively. Notably, the chitinase displayed up to 50-fold lower activity compared to other well-studied chitinases. Deletion of the genes encoding the intact chitinolytic enzymes showed that the chitinase was important for growth on {beta}-chitin, whereas the LPMO gene-deletion variants only showed minor growth defects on this substrate. Finally, proteomic analysis of Al. salmonicida LFI1238 growth on {beta}-chitin showed expression of all three chitinolytic enzymes, and intriguingly also three of the disrupted chitinases. In conclusion, our results show that Al. salmonicida LFI1238 can utilize chitin as a nutrient source and that the GH18 chitinase and the two LPMOs are needed for this ability.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe ability to utilize chitin as a source of nutrients is important for the survival and spread of marine microbial pathogens in the environment. One such pathogen is Aliivibrio (Vibrio) salmonicida, the causative agent of cold water vibriosis. Due to extensive gene decay, many key enzymes in the chitinolytic pathway have been disrupted, putatively rendering this bacterium incapable of chitin degradation and utilization. In the present study we demonstrate that Al. salmonicida can degrade and metabolize chitin, the most abundant biopolymer in the ocean. Our findings shed new light on the environmental adaption of this fish pathogen.",

It is the major source of colonic epithelial cell energy, can bind to and agonize short-chain fatty acid G-protein coupled receptors and functions as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor. Anti-cancer effects of butyrate are attributed to a global increase in histone acetylation in colon cancer cells; however, the role that corresponding chromatin remodeling plays in this effect is not fully understood. We used longitudinal paired ATAC-seq and RNA-seq on HCT-116 colon cancer cells to determine how butyrate-related chromatin changes functionally associate with cancer. We detected distinct temporal changes in chromatin accessibility in response to butyrate with less accessible regions enriched in transcription factor binding motifs and distal enhancers. These regions significantly overlapped with regions maintained by the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler, and were further enriched amongst chromatin regions that are associated with ARID1A/B synthetic lethality. Finally, we found that butyrate-induced chromatin regions were enriched for both colorectal cancer GWAS loci and somatic mutations in cancer. These results demonstrate the convergence of both somatic mutations and GWAS risk variants for colon cancer within butyrate-responsive chromatin regions, providing a molecular map of the mechanisms by which this microbial metabolite might confer anti-cancer properties.\n\nHighlightsO_LIChromatin accessibility changes longitudinally upon butyrate exposure in colon cancer cells.\nC_LIO_LIChromatin regions that close in response to butyrate are enriched among distal enhancers.\nC_LIO_LIThere is strong overlap between butyrate-induced peaks and peaks associated with SWI/SNF synthetic lethality.\nC_LIO_LIButyrate-induced peaks are enriched for colorectal cancer GWAS loci and somatic variation in colorectal cancer.\nC_LI",

Methods that are based on GWAS summary statistics seek to leverage such records, overcoming barriers that often exist in individual-level data access while also offering significant computational savings. Here, we propose a novel framework that can reconstruct allelic and genotypic counts/frequencies for each SNP from case-control GWAS summary statistics. Our framework is simple and efficient without the need of any complicated underlying assumptions. Illustrating the great potential of this framework we also propose three summary-statistics-based applications implemented in a new software package (ReACt): GWAS meta-analysis (with and without sample overlap), case-case GWAS, and, for the first time, group polygenic risk score (PRS) estimation. We evaluate our methods against the current state-of-the-art on both synthetic data and real genotype data and show high performance in power and error control. Our novel group PRS method based on summary statistics could not be achieved prior to our proposed framework. We demonstrate here the potential applications and advantages of this approach. Our work further highlights the great potential of summary-statistics-based methodologies towards elucidating the genetic background of complex disease and opens up new avenues for research.",

    "abstract": "Multivariate statistics and machine learning methods have become a common tool to extract information represented in the brain. What is less recognized is that, in the process, it has become more difficult to perform data-driven discovery and functional localization. This is because multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) studies tend to restrict themselves to a subset of the available data, or because sound inference to map model parameters back to brain anatomy is lacking. Here, we present a high-dimensional (including brain-wide) multivariate classification pipeline for the detection and localization of brain functions during tasks. In particular, we probe it at visual and socio-affective states in a task-oriented functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Classification models for a group of human participants and existing rigorous cluster inference methods are used to construct group anatomical-statistical parametric maps, which correspond to the most likely neural correlates of each psychological state. This led to the discovery of a multidimensional pattern of macroscale brain activity which reliably encodes for the perception of happiness in the visual cortex, lingual gyri and the posterior perivermian cerebellum. We failed to find similar evidence for sadness and anger. Anatomical consistency of discriminating features across subjects and contrasts despite the high number of dimensions suggests MVPA is a viable tool for a complete functional mapping pipeline, and not just the prediction of psychological states.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=134 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/438425v3_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (34K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1961forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@26d25aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bc4b35org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1eda0a6_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "Complex interactions exist between microbiomes and their hosts. Increasingly, defensive metabolites that have been attributed to host biosynthetic capability are now being recognized as products of host-associated microbes. These unique metabolites often have bioactivity targets in human disease and can be purposed as pharmaceuticals. Polyketides are a complex family of natural products that often serve as defensive metabolites for competitive or pro-survival purposes for the producing organism, while demonstrating bioactivity in human diseases as cholesterol lowering agents, anti-infectives, and anti-tumor agents. Marine invertebrates and microbes are a rich source of polyketides. Palmerolide A, a polyketide isolated from the Antarctic ascidian Synoicum adareanum, is a vacuolar-ATPase inhibitor with potent bioactivity against melanoma cell lines. The biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) responsible for production of secondary metabolites are encoded in the genomes of the producers as discrete genomic elements. A candidate palmerolide BGC was identified from a S. adareanum microbiome-metagenome based on a high degree of congruence with a chemical structure-based retrobiosynthetic prediction. Protein family homology analysis, conserved domain searches, active site and motif identification were used to identify and propose the function of the [~]75 kb trans-acyltransferase (AT) polyketide synthase-non-ribosomal synthase (PKS-NRPS) domains responsible for the stepwise synthesis of palmerolide A. Though PKS systems often act in a predictable co-linear sequence, this BGC includes multiple trans-acting enzymatic domains, a non-canonical condensation termination domain, a bacterial luciferase-like monooxygenase (LLM), and is found in multiple copies within the metagenome-assembled genome (MAG). Detailed inspection of the five highly similar pal BGC copies suggests the potential for biosynthesis of other members of the palmerolide chemical family. This is the first delineation of a biosynthetic gene cluster from an Antarctic microbial species, recently proposed as Candidatus Synoicohabitans palmerolidicus. These findings have relevance for fundamental knowledge of PKS combinatorial biosynthesis and could enhance drug development efforts of palmerolide A through heterologous gene expression.",

    "abstract": "Biochemical studies require large protein quantities, which are typically obtained using bacterial expression. However, the folding machinery of bacteria is inadequate for many mammalian proteins, which additionally undergo posttranslational modifications (PTMs) that bacteria, yeast, or insect cells cannot perform. Many proteins also require native N- and C-termini and cannot tolerate extra tag amino acids for function. Tropomyosin, a coiled coil that decorates most actin filaments in cells, requires both native N- and C-termini and PTMs, specifically N-terminal acetylation, to polymerize along actin filaments. Here, we describe a new method that combines native protein expression in human cells with an intein-based purification tag that can be precisely removed after purification. Using this method, we expressed several non-muscle tropomyosin isoforms. Mammalian cell-expressed tropomyosins are functionally different from their E. coli-expressed counterparts, display multiple types of PTMs, and can form heterodimers. This method can be extended to other proteins, as demonstrated here for -synuclein.",

    "abstract": "Drugs of abuse, including alcohol and stimulants like cocaine, produce effects that are subject to individual variability, and genetic variation accounts for at least a portion of those differences. Notably, research in both animal models and human subjects point towards reward sensitivity and impulsivity as being trait characteristics that predict relatively greater positive subjective responses to stimulant drugs. Here we describe use of the eight Collaborative Cross (CC) founder strains and multiple CC strains to examine the heritability of reward sensitivity and impulsivity traits, as well as genetic correlations between these measures and existing addiction-related phenotypes. Methods. Strains were all tested for activity in an open field and reward sensitivity (intake of chocolate BOOST(R)). Mice were then divided into two counterbalanced groups and underwent reversal learning (impulsive action and waiting impulsivity) or delay discounting (impulsive choice). Results. CC and founder mice demonstrate significant heritability for impulsive action, impulsive choice, waiting impulsivity, locomotor activity, and reward sensitivity, with each impulsive phenotype determined to be non-correlating, independent traits. This research was conducted within the broader, inter-laboratory effort of the Center for Systems Neurogenetics of Addiction (CSNA) to characterize CC and DO mice for multiple, cocaine abuse related traits. These data will facilitate the discovery of genetic correlations between predictive traits, which will then guide discovery of genes and genetic variants that contribute to addictive behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Long Interspersed Nuclear Element (LINE) retrotransposons play an important role in genomic innovation as well as genomic instability in many eukaryotes including human. Random insertions and extinction through mutational inactivation make them perfectly time-stamped \"DNA fossils\". Here, we investigated the origin of a self-cleaving ribozyme in 5 UTR of LINE-1. We showed that this ribozyme only requires 35 nucleotides for self-cleavage with a simple but previously unknown secondary-structure motif that was determined by deep mutational scanning and covariation analysis. Structure-based homology search revealed the existence of this mini-ribozyme in anthropoids but not in prosimians. In human, the most homologs of this mini-ribozyme were found in lineage L1PA6-10 but essential none in more recent L1PA1-2 or more ancient L1PA13-15. We resurrected mini-ribozymes according to consensus sequences and confirmed that mini-ribozymes were active in L1PA10 and L1PA8 but not in L1PA7 and more recent lineages. The result paints a consistent picture for the emergence of the active ribozyme around 40 million years ago, just before the divergence of the new world monkeys (Platyrrhini) and old-world monkeys (Catarrhini). The ribozyme, however, subsequently went extinct after L1PA7 emerged around 30 million years ago with a deleterious mutation. This work uncovers the rise and fall of the mini-LINE-1 ribozyme recorded in the \"DNA fossils\" of our own genome. More importantly, this ancient, naturally trans-cleaving ribozyme (after removing the non-functional stem loop) may find its modern usage in bioengineering and RNA-targeting therapeutics.",

    "abstract": "Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a conventional approach to exclude non-brain signals such as eye-movements and muscle artifacts from electroencephalography (EEG). Due to other possible EEG contaminations, a rejection of independent components (ICs) is usually performed in semiautomatic mode and requires experts involvement. Noteworthy, as also revealed by our study, experts opinion about the nature of a component often disagrees highlighting the need to develop a robust and sustainable automatic system for EEG ICs classification. The current article presents a toolbox and crowdsourcing platform for Automatic Labeling of Independent Components in Electroencephalography (ALICE) available via link http://alice.adase.org/. The ALICE toolbox aims to build a sustainable algorithm not only to remove artifacts but also to find specific patterns in EEG signals using ICA decomposition based on accumulated experts knowledge.\n\nThe difference from previous toolboxes is that the ALICE project will accumulate different benchmarks based on crowdsourced visual labeling of ICs collected from publicly available and in-house EEG recordings. The choice of labeling is based on estimation of IC time-series, IC amplitude topography and spectral power distribution. The platform allows supervised ML model training and re-training on available data subsamples for better performance in specific tasks (i.e. movement artifact detection in healthy or autistic children). Also, current research implements the novel strategy for consentient labeling of ICs by several experts. The provided baseline model shows that it can be used not only for detection of noisy IC but also for automatic identifications of components related to the functional brain oscillations such as alpha and mu-rhythm.\n\nThe ALICE project implies the creation and constant replenishment of the IC database, which will be used for continuous improvement of ML algorithms for automatic labeling and extraction of non-brain signals from EEG. The toolbox and current dataset are open-source and freely available to the researcher community.",

    "abstract": "The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits lentiviral gene therapy vector entry into hematopoietic stem cells and can be overcome by Cyclosporine H (CsH), but underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that mutating the evolutionarily conserved lysines of the IFITM3 intracellular loop abolishes its antiviral activity without affecting either its localization or its degradation by CsH through non-canonical lysosomal pathways. When confined to the plasma membrane, the lysine-competent IFITM3 lost restriction against VSV-G pseudotyped viral vectors but gained antiviral activity against vectors that fuse directly at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, altering the lysines did not alter IFITM3 homodimerization but impacted higher-order protein complex formation, suggesting loss of interaction with cellular co-factors. In agreement, IFITM3 expression was not sufficient to restrict viral vectors in myeloid K562 cells as opposed to promonocytic THP1 or primary HSC. We exclude the involvement of previously identified factors affecting IFITM3 biology and propose a novel model for IFITM3 restriction that depends on the presence of cellular co-factor(s) that may interact with IFITM3 through the intracellular loop lysine residues. Overall, our work provides significant insight into the mechanisms of action of IFITM3 and CsH that can be exploited for improved gene therapies and broadly acting antiviral strategies.",

In our previous study on endothelial cells, the rose extract reduced the secretion of inflammatory markers significantly.\n\nMethodsThe red rose extract used in this study was prepared and stored until use at -20{degrees}C. T cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 313500 cells/well in 100l of cell culture medium in duplicate, one half of the wells were used for biomarkers screening in the culture medium, and the other half for cytotoxicity assay. 24h after plating, the cells were treated in duplicate with 100l of red rose extract diluted at 0.5%, 0.1%, 0.05%, 0.01% and 0.005% (v/v) in cell culture medium or with culture medium only as control for 72h. Some other wells were for untreated cells, and cells treated with rose extract at 0.005% for 48h incubation time. After 48h and 72h, the corresponding wells were used for the cytotoxicity assay and from the duplicate wells, the cell culture media were collected and stored at -80{degrees}C until the biomarkers screening assay.\n\nResultsCytotoxicity assay revealed insignificant changes. IFN-gamma, MCP-1, GRO, RANTES and TIMP, Angiopoietin 1 and MMP-9 were elevated. Except MMP-9 which had fold changes >2 other cytokines were minimally elevated at various concentrations and timing of rose extract treatment. None of the cytokines were less than 0.8-fold.\n\nConclusionsUnlike in the endothelial cells, there is mild elevation in few inflammatory markers on T lymphocytes treatment by rose extract.

To understand the technical error due to FFPE processing, a robustly characterized normal cell line was used to create FFPE samples with four different pre-tissue processing formalin fixation times. A total of 96 FFPE sections were then distributed to different laboratories for targeted sequencing analysis by four oncopanels, and variants resulting from technical error were identified. Tissue sections that failed more frequently showed low cellularity, lower than recommended library preparation DNA input, or target sequencing depth. Importantly, sections from block surfaces were more likely to show FFPE-specific errors, akin to \"edge effects\" seen in histology, and the depth of formalin damage was related to fixation time.

ALT occurs in [~] 25% of high-risk neuroblastomas and relapse or progression in ALT neuroblastoma patients during or after front-line therapy is frequent and almost uniformly fatal. Temozolomide + irinotecan is commonly used as salvage therapy for neuroblastoma. Patient-derived cell-lines and xenografts established from relapsed ALT neuroblastoma patients demonstrated de novo resistance to temozolomide + irinotecan (as SN-38 in vitro, P<0.05) and in vivo (mouse event-free survival (EFS) P<0.0001) relative to telomerase-positive neuroblastomas. We observed that ALT neuroblastoma cells manifest constitutive ATM kinase activation due to spontaneous telomere dysfunction while telomerase- positive tumors lacked constitutive ATM activation or spontaneous telomere DNA damage. We demonstrated that induction of telomere dysfunction resulted in ATM activation that in turn conferred resistance to temozolomide + SN-38 (4.2 fold-change in IC50, P<0.001). ATM kinase shRNA knock-down or inhibition using a clinical-stage small molecule inhibitor (AZD0156) reversed resistance to temozolomide + irinotecan in ALT neuroblastoma cell-lines in vitro (P<0.001) and in 4 ALT xenografts in vivo (EFS P<0.0001). AZD0156 showed modest to no enhancement of temozolomide + irinotecan activity in telomerase-positive neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts. ATR inhibition using AZD6738 did not enhance temozolomide + SN-38 activity in ALT neuroblastoma cell lines. Thus, resistance to chemotherapy in ALT neuroblastoma occurs via ATM kinase activation and was reversed with the ATM inhibitor AZD0156. Combining AZD0156 with temozolomide + irinotecan warrants clinical testing in neuroblastoma.\n\nOne Statement SummaryATM activation at telomeres confers resistance to DNA damaging chemotherapy in ALT neuroblastoma that was reversed with ATM knockdown or inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of spliceosomal introns has been widely studied among various eukaryotic groups. Researchers nearly reached the consensuses on the pattern and the mechanisms of intron losses and gains across eukaryotes. However, according to previous studies that analyzed a few genes or genomes of nematodes, Nematoda seem to be an eccentric group. Taking advantage of the recent accumulation of sequenced genomes, we carried out an extensive analysis on the intron losses and gains using 104 nematodes genomes across all the five Clades of the phylum. Nematodes have a wide range of intron density, from less than one to more than nine per 1kbp coding sequence. The rates of intron losses and gains exhibit significant heterogeneity both across different nematode lineages and across different evolutionary stages of the same lineage. The frequency of intron losses far exceeds that of intron gains. Five pieces of evidence supporting the model of cDNA-mediated intron loss have been observed in ten Caenorhabditis species, the dominance of the precise intron losses, frequent loss of adjacent introns, and high-level expression of the intron-lost genes, preferential losses of short introns, and the preferential losses of introns close to 3'-ends of genes. Like studies in most eukaryotic groups, we cannot find the source sequences for the limited number of intron gains detected in the Caenorhabditis genomes. All the results indicate that nematodes are a typical eukaryotic group rather than an outlier in intron evolution.",

    "abstract": "The oral mucosa remains an understudied barrier tissue rich in exposure to antigens, commensals and pathogens. Moreover, it is the tissue where one of the most prevalent human microbe-triggered inflammatory diseases, periodontitis, occurs. To understand this complex environment at the cellular level, we assemble herein a human single-cell transcriptome atlas of oral mucosal tissues in health and periodontitis. Our work reveals transcriptional diversity of stromal and immune cell populations, predicts intercellular communication and uncovers an altered immune responsiveness of stromal cells participating in tissue homeostasis and disease at the gingival mucosa. In health, we define unique populations of CXCL1,2,8-expressing epithelial cells and fibroblasts mediating immune homeostasis primarily through the recruitment of neutrophils. In disease, we further observe stromal, particularly fibroblast hyper-responsiveness linked to recruitment of leukocytes and neutrophil populations. Ultimately, a stromal-neutrophil axis emerges as a key regulator of mucosal immunity. Pursuant to these findings, most Mendelian forms of periodontitis were shown to be linked to genetic mutations in neutrophil and select fibroblast-expressed genes. Moreover, we document previously unappreciated expression of known pattern- and damage-recognition receptors on stromal cell populations in the setting of periodontitis, suggesting avenues for triggering stromal responses. This comprehensive atlas offers an important reference for in-depth understanding of oral mucosal homeostasis and inflammation and reveals unique stromal-immune interactions implicated in tissue immunity.",

Plants response to drought was mainly measured using relative water content (RWC) and stomata closure upon exogenous ABA.\n\nResultsThree MYB TFs studied are involved in plant response to drought. When downregulated in Arabidopsis, the MYB33, MYB65 and MYB101 genes cause stomatal hyposensitivity to ABA, leading to reduced tolerance to drought. Transgenic Arabidopsis and potato plants overexpressing a mutated version of these genes with changed miR159 recognition site, show hypersensitivity to ABA and relatively high tolerance to drought conditions.\n\nConclusionsThe MYB33, MYB65, and MYB101 genes are good be potential targets for innovative breeding to obtain crops with relatively high tolerance to drought.",

    "abstract": "Chemical modifications of RNA 5' ends enable \"epitranscriptomic\" regulation, influencing multiple aspects of RNA fate. In transcription initiation, a large inventory of substrates compete with nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) for use as initiating entities, providing an ab initio mechanism for altering the RNA 5' end. In Escherichia coli cells, RNAs with a 5'-end hydroxyl are generated by use of dinucleotide RNAs as primers for transcription initiation, \"primer-dependent initiation.\" Here we use massively systematic transcript end readout (\"MASTER\") to detect and quantify RNA 5' ends generated by primer-dependent initiation for ~410 (~1,000,000) promoter sequences in E. coli. The results show primer-dependent initiation in E. coli involves any of the 16 possible dinucleotide primers and depends on promoter sequences in, upstream, and downstream of the primer binding site. The results yield a consensus sequence for primer-dependent initiation, YTSS-2NTSS-1NTSSWTSS+1, where TSS is the transcription start site, NTSS-1NTSS is the primer binding site, Y is pyrimidine, and W is A or T. Biochemical and structure-determination studies show that the base pair (nontemplate-strand base:template-strand base) immediately upstream of the primer binding site (Y:RTSS-2, where R is purine) exerts its effect through the base on the DNA template strand (RTSS-2) through inter-chain base stacking with the RNA primer. Results from analysis of a large set of natural, chromosomally-encoded E. coli promoters support the conclusions from MASTER. Our findings provide a mechanistic and structural description of how TSS-region sequence hard-codes not only the TSS position, but also the potential for epitranscriptomic regulation through primer-dependent transcription initiation.",

    "abstract": "SARS-CoV-2 non-structural protein 3 (Nsp3) contains a macrodomain that is essential for virus replication and is thus an attractive target for drug development. This macrodomain is thought to counteract the host interferon (IFN) response, an important antiviral signalling cascade, via the removal of ADP-ribose modifications catalysed by host poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs). Here, we show that activation of the IFN response induces ADP-ribosylation of host proteins and that ectopic expression of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 macrodomain reverses this modification in human cells. We further demonstrate that this can be used to screen for cell-active macrodomain inhibitors without the requirement for BSL-3 facilities. This IFN-induced ADP-ribosylation is dependent on the PARP9/DTX3L heterodimer, but surprisingly the expression of Nsp3 macrodomain or PARP9/DTX3L deletion do not impair STAT1 phosphorylation or the induction of IFN-responsive genes. Our results suggest that PARP9/DTX3L-dependent ADP-ribosylation is a downstream effector of the host IFN response and that the cellular function of the SARS-CoV-2 Nsp3 macrodomain is to hydrolyse this end product of IFN signalling, and not to suppress the IFN response itself.",

    "abstract": "Septins, a family of GTP-binding proteins assembling into higher order structures, interface with the membrane, actin filaments and microtubules, which positions them as important regulators of cytoarchitecture. Septin 9 (Sept9), which is frequently overexpressed in tumors and mutated in hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy (HNA), mediates the binding of septins to microtubules, but the molecular determinants of this interaction remained uncertain. We demonstrate that a short MAP-like motif unique to Sept9 isoform 1 (Sept9_i1) drives septin octamer-microtubule interaction in cells and in vitro reconstitutions. Septin-microtubule association requires polymerizable septin octamers harboring Sept9_i1. Although outside of the MAP-like motif, HNA mutations abrogates this association, identifying a putative regulatory domain. Removal of this domain from Sept9_i1 sequesters septins on microtubules, promotes microtubule stability and alters actomyosin fiber distribution and tension. Thus, we identify key molecular determinants and potential regulatory roles of septin-microtubule interaction, paving the way to deciphering the mechanisms underlying septin associated pathologies.",

    "abstract": "The human brain recognizes hand-written digits by extracting the features from a few training samples that compose the digit image including horizontal, vertical, and orthogonal lines as well as full or semi-circles. In this study, we present a novel brain-inspired method to extract such features from handwritten digits images in the MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database). In this study, we developed an explainable feature extraction method for hand written digit classification in which the extracted information are stored inside the neurons as non-synaptic memory manner. For this purpose, a neural network with 10 single neurons was trained to extract features of training images (each neuron represents one digit class). Following that, the trained single neurons are used for the retrieval of information from test images in order to assign them to digit categories. The accuracy of the classification method of test set images is calculated for different number of training samples per digit. The method demonstrates 75 % accuracy using 0.016 % of the training data and maximally shows accuracy 86 % using one epoch of whole training data. The method as an understandable feature extraction method allows users to see how it works and why it does not perform well on some digit classes. To our knowledge, this is the first model that stores information inside single neurons (i.e., non-synaptic memory) instead of storing the information in synapses of connected layers. Due to enabling single neurons to compute individually, it is expected that such class of neural networks show higher performance compared to traditional neural networks used in complicated classification problems.",

Using a tail wound inflammation assay we find a conserved role for hmox1a, but not hmox1b, in normal macrophage migration to the wound site.

Little is known about what controls the precise timing of angioblast migration and their final destination at the midline. Using zebrafish, we found that midline angioblast migration requires neighboring tissue rearrangements generated by somite morphogenesis. The somitic shape changes cause the adjacent notochord to separate from the underlying endoderm, creating a ventral midline cavity that provides a physical space for the angioblasts to migrate into. The anterior to posterior progression of midline angioblast migration is facilitated by retinoic acid induced anterior to posterior somite maturation and the subsequent progressive opening of the ventral midline cavity. Our work demonstrates a critical role for somite morphogenesis in organizing surrounding tissues to facilitate notochord positioning and angioblast migration, which is ultimately responsible for creating a functional cardiovascular system.\n\nSummary statementRetinoic acid induced somite morphogenesis generates a midline cavity that accommodates migrating angioblasts, which form the axial blood vessels.",

We screened several adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes and identified AAV8 as an efficient vector to drive exogenous Lhcgr expression in progenitor Leydig cells through interstitial injection. We observed considerable testosterone recovery and Leydig cell maturation after AAV8-Lhcgr treatment in pubertal Lhcgr-/- mice. This gene therapy substantially recovered sexual development, partially restored spermatogenesis and effectively produced fertile offspring.

    "abstract": "Neurons process real-time information from axon terminals to coordinate gene expression, growth and plasticity. Input from distal axons is encoded as a stream of endocytic organelles, termed signalling endosomes, targeted to the soma. Formation of these organelles depends on target-derived molecules, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is recognised by TrkB receptors on the plasma membrane, endocytosed and transported to the cell body along the microtubules network. Notwithstanding its neuropathological importance, the mechanism controlling the sorting of TrkB to signalling endosomes is currently unknown. In this work, we uncover the small GTPase Rab10 as critical for TrkB sorting and propagation of BDNF signalling from axon terminals to the soma. Our data demonstrate that Rab10 defines a novel class of axonal organelles, rapidly mobilised towards the axon terminal upon BDNF stimulation, enabling the axon to fine-tune retrograde signalling depending on BDNF availability at the synapse. These results help clarifying the neuroprotective phenotype recently associated to Rab10 polymorphisms and provide a new therapeutic target to halt neurodegeneration.",

    "abstract": "The cellular landscape of the human intestinal tract is dynamic throughout life, developing in utero and changing in response to functional requirements and environmental exposures. To comprehensively map cell lineages in the healthy developing, pediatric and adult human gut from ten distinct anatomical regions, as well as draining lymph nodes, we used singlecell RNA-seq and VDJ analysis of roughly one third of a million cells. This reveals the presence of BEST4+ absorptive cells throughout the human intestinal tract, demonstrating the existence of this cell type beyond the colon for the first time. Furthermore, we implicate IgG sensing as a novel function of intestinal tuft cells, and link these cells to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. We define novel glial and neuronal cell populations in the developing enteric nervous system, and predict cell-type specific expression of Hirschsprungs disease-associated genes. Finally, using a systems approach, we identify key cell players across multiple cell lineages driving secondary lymphoid tissue formation in early human development. We show that these programs are adopted in inflammatory bowel disease to recruit and retain immune cells at the site of inflammation. These data provide an unprecedented catalogue of intestinal cells, and new insights into cellular programs in development, homeostasis and disease.",

    "abstract": "G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structures are implicated in central biological processes and are considered promising therapeutic targets because of their links to human diseases such as cancer. However, functional details of how, when, and why G4 DNA structures form in vivo are largely missing leaving a knowledge gap that requires tailored chemical biology studies in relevant live-cell model systems. Towards this end, we developed a synthetic platform centered around one of the most effective and selective G4 stabilizing compounds, Phen-DC3. We used a structure-based design to equip Phen-DC3 with an amine in a position that does not interfere with G4 interactions. To evaluate the power of the approach, we next used this reactive handle to conjugate a BODIPY fluorophore and a cell-penetrating peptide to Phen-DC3. The BODIPY conjugation generated a fluorescent derivative with retained G4 selectivity, G4 stabilization, and cellular effects that revealed the localization and function of Phen-DC3 in human cells. On the other hand, the cell-penetrating peptide conjugation, while retaining G4 selectivity and stabilization, increased nuclear localization and cellular effects, showcasing the potential of this approach to modulate and direct cellular uptake e.g. as delivery vehicles. The developed platform can thus generate tailored biochemical tools for the studies of G4 biology to uncover molecular details and therapeutic approaches.",

    "abstract": "AimsCardiomyocyte-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may represent a promising therapeutic strategy for severely damaged myocardium. This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of clinical grade human iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-CM) patches and conduct a pre-clinical proof-of-concept analysis.\n\nMethods and resultsA clinical grade hiPSC line was established from peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from a healthy volunteer homozygous for human leukocyte antigens and differentiated into cardiomyocytes using cytokines and chemical compounds. hiPSC-CMs were cultured on temperature-responsive culture dishes to fabricate the hiPSC-CM patch. The hiPSC-CMs expressed cardiomyocyte-specific genes and proteins while electrophysiological analyses revealed that hiPSC-CMs were similar to the human myocardium. In vitro safety studies using cell growth, soft agar colony formation, and undifferentiated cell assays indicated that tumourigenic cells were not present. Moreover, no genomic mutations were discovered using whole genome and exome sequencing analysis. Tumour formation was not detected in an in vivo tumourigenicity assay using NOG mice. General toxicity tests also showed no adverse events due to hiPSC-CM patch transplantation. An efficacy study using a porcine model of myocardial infarction demonstrated significantly improved cardiac function with angiogenesis and a reduction in interstitial fibrosis, which was enhanced by cytokine secretion from hiPSC-CM patches after transplantation. No lethal arrhythmias were observed.\n\nConclusionhiPSC-CM patches show promise for future translational research and clinical trials for ischaemic heart failure.\n\nOne-sentence summaryThis pre-clinical study provides a proof-of-concept of the safety and efficacy of hiPSC-CM patches for the treatment of heart failure.\n\nTranslational PerspectiveRegenerative therapy using cells and tissues is attractive as a novel approach for treating severe heart failure. We focused on human iPS cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) as a cell source. Using basic research, the characteristics of hiPSC, hiPSC-CMs, and hiPSC-CM patches were determined in vitro and in vivo. We also conducted a pre-clinical study using a porcine model of myocardial infarction that confirmed the safety and efficacy of the hiPSC-CM patch, highlighting its potential for clinical application.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated animal locomotion depends on the development of functional proprioceptors. While early cell-fate determination processes are well characterized, little is known about the terminal differentiation of cells within the proprioceptive lineage and the genetic networks that control them. In this work we describe a gene regulatory network consisting of three transcription factors-Prospero (Pros), D-Pax2 and Delilah (Dei)-that dictates two alternative differentiation programs within the proprioceptive lineage in Drosophila. We show that D-Pax2 and Pros control the differentiation of cap versus scolopale cells in the chordotonal organ lineage by, respectively, activating and repressing the transcription of dei. Normally, D-Pax2 activates the expression of dei in the cap cell but is unable to do so in the scolopale cell where Pros is co-expressed. We further show that D-Pax2 and Pros exert their effects on dei transcription via a 262 bp chordotonal-specific enhancer in which two D-Pax2- and three Pros-binding sites were identified experimentally. When this enhancer was removed from the fly genome, the cap- and ligament-specific expression of dei was lost, resulting in loss of chordotonal organ functionality and defective larval locomotion. Thus, coordinated larval locomotion depends on the activity of a dei enhancer that integrates both activating and repressive inputs for the generation of a functional proprioceptive organ.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, very few hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are produced from the hemogenic endothelium, that will be expanded in a very specific niche. This fetal HSC niche comprises a complex and dynamic molecular network of interactions between multiple cell types, including endothelial cells (ECs) and mesenchymal stromal cells. It is known that functional changes in the hematopoietic niche, such as aging, vascular cell remodelling or inflammation can directly affect HSCs. Among all these inflammatory regulators, the eicosanoid prostaglandin E (PGE2) has been shown to be very important during embryonic life. However, the precise source of PGE2 in the embryo is still elusive. Here we show that all the genes involved in PGE2 synthesis and transport are expressed by distinct cells of the caudal hematopoietic tissue (CHT) in the zebrafish embryo and in the mouse fetal liver, suggesting that each cell type acts sequentially and collaboratively with the others to produce PGE2 and ultimately expand HSCs. Among these cells, we found myeloid cells (both neutrophils and macrophages) to be absolutely necessary, as they concur to the production of PGH2, the precursor of PGE2. To measure the impact of myeloid cells, we generated a genetic model of myeloid ablation, which caused a loss of HSCs in the CHT, that could be rescued by supplementing zebrafish embryos with PGE2 or PGH2. ECs expressed the slco2b1 transporter to import PGH2, and ptges3, the necessary enzyme to convert this latter into PGE2. Taken altogether, our data show that the triad composed of neutrophils, macrophages and ECs concurs to HSC expansion in the CHT.",

    "abstract": "CD95L is expressed by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes to eliminate CD95-expressing tumor cells and thereby CD95 loss by tumor cells is often considered as a consequence of an immunoediting process. Nonetheless CD95 expression is maintained in most triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), and we recently reported that CD95 loss in TNBC cells triggers the induction of a pro-inflammatory program promoting the recruitment of cytotoxic NK and CD8+ T-cells and impairing tumor growth. Using a comprehensive proteomic approach, we have identified two yet unknown CD95 interaction partners, Kip1 ubiquitination-promoting complex protein 2 (KPC2) and p65. KPC2 contributes to the partial degradation of p105 (NF{kappa}B1) and the subsequent generation of p50 homodimers, which transcriptionally represses pro-inflammatory NF-{kappa}B-driven gene expression. Mechanistically, KPC2 directly interacts with the C-terminal region of CD95 and links the receptor to RelA (p65) and KPC1, the catalytic subunit of the KPC complex that acts as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase promoting the partial degradation of p105 into p50. Loss of CD95 in TNBC cells releases KPC2, limiting the formation of the NF-{kappa}B inhibitory homodimer complex (p50/p50), promoting NF-{kappa}B activation and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including CSF1, CSF2, CXCL1 and IL1 members, known to promote recruitment and differentiation of certain adaptive and innate immune effector cells.",

    "abstract": "Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to extract valuable tissue measurements and white matter (WM) fiber orientations, even though its lack of specificity is now well-known, especially for WM fiber crossings. Models such as constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) take advantage of high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data to compute fiber orientation distribution functions (fODF) and tackle the orientational part of the DTI limitations. Furthermore, the recent introduction of tensor-valued diffusion MRI allows for diffusional variance decomposition (DIVIDE), opening the door to the computation of measures more specific to microstructure than DTI measures, such as microscopic fractional anisotropy (FA). However, tensor-valued diffusion MRI data is not mathematically compatible with latest versions of CSD and the impacts of such atypical data on fODF reconstruction with CSD are yet to be studied. In this work, we lay down the mathematical and computational foundations of a tensor-valued CSD and use simulated data to explore the effects of various combinations of diffusion encodings on the angular resolution of extracted fOFDs. We also compare the combinations with regards to their performance at producing accurate and precise FA with DIVIDE, and present an optimised protocol for both methods. We show that our proposed protocol enables the reconstruction of both fODFs and FA on in vivo data.",

On the one hand ecotourism could impact the occurrence, survival or behavior of species, on the other hand ecotourism is often mentioned as providing a \"human shield\" by deterring negative practices like gold mining, logging and hunting.\n\nBrownsberg Nature Park is easily the most visited protected area of Suriname, with a high number of ecotourists visiting from abroad. A four-year study on the impact of ecotourism on medium-large terrestrial mammals was carried out between 2013 and 2016 using 16 camera trapping stations. The area has a clear gradient of tourism pressure, with the pressure decreasing further away from the lodging facilities. Evidently, the impacts of human presence on the mammal communities were more significant in the busiest areas. Most species avoided areas with many hikers or switched to a more nocturnal activity pattern. In these areas the impact was not reflected in species numbers, however it was causing a significant lowering of the diversity of mammals. On the other hand, vehicles had little impact on species avoidance or diversity, but did increase nocturnality even more than hikers. A few species seemed to be \"attracted\" by hikers and/or traffic. Giant armadillos and spotted pacas used the pools in the road created by traffic. Ocelots, margays and red-rumped agoutis seemed to favor human disturbance probably because of predator release. Some of the most impacted species were the jaguar, puma and lowland tapir, all three species with significant contribution to ecosystem balance. Their avoidance or even disappearance from highly human frequented areas could easily result in ecosystem changes in these areas. Management measures should focus on lowering the number of hikers in popular places and limiting the number of vehicles in recreational or tourist areas.",

Relative to P. flexilis, P. longaeva and P. balfouriana are attacked by MPB less frequently, and MPB brood production in P. longaeva is limited. Because greater lignification of feeding tissues has been shown to provide defense against bark beetles in related genera, such as Picea, we hypothesized that P. longaeva and P. balfouriana would have greater lignin concentrations than P. flexilis. Contrary to expectations, we found that the more MPB-susceptible P. flexilis had greater phloem lignin levels than the less susceptible P. longaeva and P. balfouriana. No differences in outer bark lignin levels among the species were found. We conclude that lignification in Pinus phloem and outer bark is likely not adaptive as a physical defense against MPB.",

This estimation, called the intrinsic timescale, has been computed for several cortical areas and can be used to propose a cortical hierarchy reflecting a scale of temporal receptive windows between areas. In this study, we performed an autocorrelation analysis on neuronal populations of three basal ganglia (BG) nuclei, including the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the input structures of the BG, and the external globus pallidus (GPe). The analysis was performed during the baseline period of a motivational visuomotor task in which monkeys had to apply different amounts of force to receive a different amount of reward. We found that the striatum and the STN have longer intrinsic timescales than the GPe. Moreover, our results allow for the placement of these subcortical structures within the already-defined scale of cortical temporal receptive windows. Estimates of intrinsic timescales are important in adding further constraints in the development of computational models of the complex dynamics among these nuclei and throughout cortico-BG-thalamo-cortical loops.",

    "abstract": "Williams syndrome (WS) and Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are psychiatric conditions associated with atypical but opposite face-to-face interactions patterns: WS patients overly stare at others, ASD individuals escape eye contact. Whether these behaviors result from dissociable visual processes within the occipito-temporal pathways is unknown.\n\nUsing high-density electroencephalography, multivariate signal processing algorithms and a protocol designed to identify and extract evoked activities sensitive to facial cues, we investigated how WS (N=14), ASD (N=14) and neurotypical subjects (N=14) decode the information content of a face stimulus.\n\nWe found two neural components in neurotypical participants, both strongest when the eye region was projected onto the subjects fovea, simulating a direct eye contact situation, and weakest over more distant regions, reaching a minimum when the focused region was outside the stimulus face. The first component peaks at 170ms, an early signal known to be implicated in low-level face features. The second is identified later, 260ms post-stimulus onset and is implicated in decoding salient face social cues.\n\nRemarkably, both components were found distinctly impaired and preserved in WS and ASD. In WS, we could weakly decode the 170ms signal based on our regressor relative to facial features, probably due to their relatively poor ability to process faces morphology, while the late 260ms component was highly significant. The reverse pattern was observed in ASD participants who showed neurotypical like early 170ms evoked activity but impaired late evoked 260ms signal. Our study reveals a dissociation between WS and ASD patients and point at different neural origins for their social impairments.",

    "abstract": "Integrated Information Theory is currently the leading mathematical theory of consciousness. The core of the theory relies on the calculation of a scalar mathematical measure of consciousness, {Phi}, which is deduced from the phenomenological axioms of the theory. Here, we show that despite its widespread use, {Phi} is not a well-defined mathematical concept in the sense that the value it specifies is neither unique nor specific. This problem, occasionally referred to as \"undetermined qualia\", is the result of degeneracies in the optimization routine used to calculate {Phi}, which leads to ambiguities in determining the consciousness of systems under study. As demonstration, we first apply the mathematical definition of {Phi} to a simple AND+OR logic gate system and show 83 non-unique {Phi} values result, spanning a substantial portion of the range of possibilities. We then introduce a Python package called PyPhi-Spectrum which, unlike currently available packages, delivers the entire spectrum of possible {Phi} values for a given system. We apply this to a variety of examples of recently published calculations of {Phi} and show how virtually all {Phi} values from the sampled literature are chosen arbitrarily from a set of non-unique possibilities, the full range of which often includes both conscious and unconscious predictions. Lastly, we review proposed solutions to this degeneracy problem, and find none to provide a satisfactory solution, either because they fail to specify a unique {Phi} value or yield {Phi} = 0 for systems that are clearly integrated. We conclude with a discussion of requirements moving forward for scientifically valid theories of consciousness that avoid these degeneracy issues.",

    "abstract": "In chronic and degenerative diseases impacting the skin folates play an important metabolic role improving wound healing and reducing skin irritations. In contrast to systemic folate administration little is known on skin penetration of folates after topical application. Here the penetration of simple aqueous solutions of reduced folates have been investigated with in-vitro reconstructed skin models mimicking the barrier of native human skin. For up to 24 h, penetration of the epidermis by newly developed folate salts and formulations were investigated. Aqueous and lipophilic solutions of L-formyltetrahydrofolate and L-mefolinate salts were able to penetrate the epidermis. Even more importantly, the skin model revealed the metabolic conversion of L-folinate to L-methyltetrahydrofolate. Exemplarily the effects of these new folate salts have been tested on wound healing in a scratch assay with primary human keratinocytes. All folates applied were able to enhance wound healing compared to the control.\n\nBioavailability, metabolic conversion and physiologic effectiveness of new folate formulation have been shown successfully in in vitro applications providing evidence for the potent applicability of the new folates in preparations for topic application.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMaternal undernutrition has been associated with psychiatric and neurological disorders characterized by learning and memory impairment. Considering the lack of evidence for this, we aimed to analyze the effects of gestational protein restriction on learning and memory function later in life. This research associates behavioral findings with hippocampal cell numbers and protein content related to neurodegenerative brain disease.\n\nMethodsExperiments were conducted in animals subjected to a low-protein (LP, 6% casein) or regular-protein (NP, 17% casein) diet throughout their pregnancy. Behavioral tests, isolated hippocampal isotropic fractionator cell studies, immunoblotting, and survival lifetime tests were performed. The results confirmed that the birthweight of LP male pups significantly reduced relative to NP male pups and that hippocampal mass increased in 88-week-old LP compared to age-matched NP offspring. We used the Morris water maze proximity measure, which is the sum of 10 distances each second between rat position and location of a hidden platform target, as a suitable test for assessing age-related learning or memory impairment in aged offspring.\n\nResultsThe results showed an increased proximity measure in 87-week-old LP rats (52.6 x 104 {+/-} 10.3 x 104 mm) as compared to NP rats (47.0 x 104 {+/-} 10.6 x 103 mm, p = 0.0007). In addition, LP rats exhibited anxiety-like behaviors compared to NP rats at 48 and 86 weeks of life.\n\nAdditionally, the estimated neuron number was unaltered in LP rats; however, glial and other cell numbers increased in LP compared to NP rats. Here, we showed unprecedented hippocampal deposition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, {beta}-amyloid peptide (A{beta}), and tau protein in 88-week-old LP compared to age-matched NP offspring. To date, no predicted studies showed changes in hippocampal neuron and glial cell numbers in maternal protein-restricted elderly offspring. The current data suggest that maternal protein restriction has a high impact on lifespan and brain structure, and function.\n\nConclusionthe gestational protein restriction may accelerate hippocampal function loss, impacting learning/memory performance, and supposedly developing diseases similar to Alzheimers disease (AD) in elderly offspring. Thus, we propose that maternal protein restriction could be a probable, elegant, and novel method for constructing an AD-like model in adult male offspring.",

    "abstract": "Relative humidity (RH) was measured at hourly intervals for approximately one year in two caves at seven stations near Playa del Carmen in Quintana Roo, Mexico. Sistema Muevelo Rico is a 1.1 km long cave with 12 entrances and almost no dark zone. Rio Secreto (Tuch) is a large river cave with more than 40 km of passages, and an extensive dark zone. Given the need for cave specialists to adapt to saturated humidity, presumably by cuticular thinning, the major stress of RH would be its deviation from saturation. RH in Rio Secreto (Tuch) was invariant at three sites and displayed short deviations from 100% RH at the other four sites. These deviations were concentrated at the end of the nortes and beginning of the rainy season. Three of the sites in Sistema Muevelo Rico showed a similar pattern although the timing of the deviations from 100% RH was somewhat displaced. Four sites in Sistema Muevelo Rico were more variable, and were analyzed using a measure of amount of time of deviation from 100% RH for each 24 hour period. Strong seasonality was evident but, remarkably, periods of constant high humidity were not the same at all sites. In most Sistema Muevelo Rico sites, there was a detectable 24 hour cycle in RH, although it was quite weak in about half of them. For Rio Secreto (Tuch) only one site showed any sign of a 24 hour cycle. The troglomorphic fauna was more or less uniformly spread throughout the caves and did not concentrate in any one area or set of RH conditions. Compared to temperature, RH is much more constant, perhaps even more constant than the amount of light.",

Calculation of heterozygosity (Hp), nucleotide diversity ({pi}), and LD level indicated that Guangxi populations were characterized by higher genetic diversity and lower differentiation than RJFt and commercial breeds except HGFC. Population structure analysis also confirmed the introgression from commercial broiler breeds. Each population clustered together while the overall differentiation was small, MA has the richest genetic diversity among all varieties. Selective sweep analysis revealed BCO2, EDN3 and other candidate genes have received strong selection in local breeds, these also provided novel breeding visual and data basis for future breeding.",

    "abstract": "Plant species from Annonaceae are commonly used in traditional medicine to treat various cancer types. This study aimed to investigate the antiproliferative potential of an alkaloid and acetogenin-rich fraction from the fruit peel of Annona crassiflora in HepG2 cells. A liquid-liquid fractionation was carried out on the ethanol extract of A. crassiflora fruit peel in order to obtain an alkaloid and acetogenin-rich fraction (AF-Ac). Cytotoxicity, proliferation and migration were evaluated in the HepG2 cells, as well as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), vinculin and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression. In addition, intracellular Ca2+ was determined using Fluo4-AM and fluorescence microscopy. First, 9 aporphine alkaloids and 4 acetogenins that had not yet been identified in the fruit peel of A. crassiflora were found in AF-Ac. The treatment with 50 {micro}g/mL AF-Ac reduced HepG2 cell viability, proliferation and migration (p < 0.001), which is in accordance with the reduced expression of PCNA and EGFR levels (p < 0.05). Furthermore, AF-Ac increased intracellular Ca2+ in the HepG2 cells, mobilizing intracellular calcium stores, which might be involved in the anti-migration and anti-proliferation capacities of AF-Ac. Our results support the growth-inhibitory potential of AF-Ac on HepG2 cells and suggest that this effect is triggered, at least in part, by PCNA and EGFR modulation and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. This study showed biological activities not yet described for A. crassiflora fruit peel, which provide new possibilities for further in vivo studies to assess the antitumoral potential of A. crassiflora, especially its fruit peel.",

Here we report that silencing the ribosomal protein S6 kinase 2 (S6K2), while preserving the activity of S6K1, perturbs lipid metabolism, enhances fatty acid unsaturation, triggers lipid peroxidation and induces cell death selectively in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells that are resistant to MAPK inhibition. S6K2 depletion stimulates SREBP1 activity in an S6K1-dependent manner and relieves suppression of PPAR, triggering apoptosis and ferroptosis. Combining PPAR agonists and polyunsaturated fatty acids phenocopies the effects of S6K2 abrogation, blocking tumor growth.

    "abstract": "Highly conserved hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF1) and its target 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) play a critical role in the survival of damaged {beta}-cells in type 2 diabetes (T2D) while rendering {beta}-cells non-responsive to glucose stimulation by mitochondrial suppression. HIF1-PFKFB3 is activated in 30-50% of all {beta}-cells in diabetic islets, leaving an open question of whether targeting this pathway may adjust {beta}-cell mass and function to the specific metabolic demands during diabetogenic stress.\n\nOur previous studies of {beta}-cells under amyloidogenic stress by human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) revealed that PFKFB3 is a metabolic execution arm of the HIF1 pathway with potent implications on Ca2+ homeostasis, metabolome, and mitochondrial form and function.\n\nTo discriminate the role of PFKFB3 from HIF1 in vivo, we generated mice with conditional {beta}-cell specific disruption of the Pfkfb3 gene on a hIAPP+/- background and a high-fat diet (HFD) [PFKFB3{beta}KO + diabetogenic stress (DS)].\n\nPFKFB3 disruption in {beta}-cells under diabetogenic stress led to selective purging of hIAPP-damaged {beta}-cells and the disappearance of bihormonal insulin- and glucagon-positive cells, thus compromised {beta}-cells. At the same time, PFKFB3 disruption led to a three-fold increase in {beta}-cell replication resembling control levels as measured with minichromosome maintenance 2 protein (MCM2). PFKFB3 disruption depleted bihormonal cells while increased {beta}-cell replication that was reflected in the increased {beta}-/-cell ratio and maintained {beta}-cell mass. Analysis of metabolic performance indicated comparable glucose intolerance and reduced plasma insulin levels in PFKFB3{beta}KO DS relative to PFKFB3WT DS mice. In the PFKFB3{beta}KO DS group, plasma glucagon levels were reduced compared to PFKFB3WT DS mice and were in line with increased insulin sensitivity. Glucose intolerance in PFKFB3{beta}KO DS mice could be explained by the compensatory expression of HIF1 after disruption of PFKFB3. Our data strongly suggest that the replication and functional recovery of {beta}-cells under diabetogenic stress depend on selective purification of HIF1 and PFKFB3-positive {beta}-cells. Thus, HIF1-PFKFB3-dependent activation of cell competition and purging of compromised {beta}-cells may yield functional competent {beta}-cell mass in diabetes.",

    "abstract": "Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is crucial for coupling receptor stimulation to cellular bioenergetics. Further, Ca2+ uptake by respiring mitochondria prevents Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) of store-operated Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channels and inhibits Ca2+ extrusion to sustain cytosolic Ca2+ signaling. However, how Ca2+ uptake by the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter (MCU) shapes receptor-evoked interorganellar Ca2+ signaling is unknown. Here, we generated several cell lines with MCU-knockout (MCU-KO) as well as tissue-specific MCU-knockdown mice. We show that mitochondrial depolarization, but not MCU-KO, inhibits store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE). Paradoxically, despite enhancing Ca2+ extrusion and promoting CRAC channel CDI, MCU-KO increased cytosolic Ca2+ in response to store depletion. Further, physiological agonist stimulation in MCU-KO cells led to enhanced frequency of cytosolic Ca2+ oscillations, endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ refilling, NFAT nuclear translocation and proliferation. However, MCU-KO did not affect inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor activity. Mathematical modeling supports that MCU-KO enhances cytosolic Ca2+, despite limiting CRAC channel activity.",
