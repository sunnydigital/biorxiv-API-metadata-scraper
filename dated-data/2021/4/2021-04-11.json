    "abstract": "Genetics impacts sleep, yet, the molecular mechanisms underlying sleep regulation remain elusive. We built machine learning (ML) models to predict genes based on their similarity to known sleep genes. Using a manually curated list of 109 labeled sleep genes, we trained a prediction model on thousands of published datasets, representing circadian, immune, sleep deprivation, and many other processes. Our predictions fit with prior knowledge of sleep regulation and also identify several key genes/pathways to pursue in follow-up studies. We tested one of our findings, the NF-{kappa}B pathway, and showed that its genetic alteration affects sleep duration in mice. Our study highlights the power of ML to integrate prior knowledge and genome-wide data to study genetic regulation of sleep and other complex behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Patients with Alagille syndrome carry monogenic mutations in the Notch signaling pathway and face complications such as jaundice and cholestasis. Given the presence of intrahepatic ductopenia in these patients, Notch2 receptor signaling has been implicated in driving normal biliary development and downstream branching morphogenesis. As a result, in vitro model systems of liver epithelium are needed to further mechanistic insight of biliary tissue assembly. Here, we systematically evaluate primary human intrahepatic cholangiocytes as a candidate population for such a platform and describe conditions that direct their branching morphogenesis. We find that extracellular matrix presentation, coupled with mitogen stimulation, promotes biliary branching in a Notch-dependent manner. These results demonstrate the utility of using 3D scaffolds for mechanistic investigation of cholangiocyte branching and provides a gateway to integrate biliary architecture in additional in vitro models of liver tissue.",

    "abstract": "Emotions play an indicative and informative role in the investigation of farm animal behaviors. Systems that respond and can measure emotions provide a natural user interface in enabling the digitalization of animal welfare platforms. The faces of farm animals can be one of the richest channels for expressing emotions. We present WUR Wolf (Wageningen University & Research: Wolf Mascot)--a real-time facial expression recognition platform that can automatically code the emotions of farm animals. Using Python-based algorithms, we detect and track the facial features of cows and pigs, analyze the appearance, ear postures, and eye white regions, and correlate with the mental/emotional states of the farm animals. The system is trained on dataset of facial features of images of the farm animals collected in over 6 farms and has been optimized to operate with an average accuracy of 85%. From these, we infer the emotional states of animals in real time. The software detects 13 facial actions and 9 emotional states, including whether the animal is aggressive, calm, or neutral. A real-time emotion recognition system based on YoloV3, and Faster YoloV4-based facial detection platform and an ensemble Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNN) is presented. Detecting expressions of farm animals simultaneously in real time makes many new interfaces for automated decision-making tools possible for livestock farmers. Emotions sensing offers a vast amount of potential for improving animal welfare and animal-human interactions.",

    "abstract": "Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have led to the development of personalized genomic profiles in diagnostic panels that inform oncologists of alterations in clinically relevant genes. While targeted therapies for some alterations may be found, an effective therapeutic strategy should consider multiple and dependent genetic interactions that affect cancer progression, a task which remains challenging. There are ongoing efforts to profile cancer cells in-vitro, both to catalog their genomic information and study their sensitivity to various drugs. There is a need for tools that can interpret the personalized genomic profile of a patient in light of information from these biological and pre-clinical studies and recommend potentially useful drugs. To address this need, we develop a new algorithmic framework called DruID, to effectively combine drug efficacy predictions from a deep neural network model with information, such as drug sensitivity, drug-drug interactions and genetic dependencies, from multiple publicly available databases. We empirically evaluate DruID on cancer cell line data on which efficacy of many drugs have been experimentally determined. We find that DruID outperforms competing approaches and promises to be a useful tool in clinical decision-making.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWConformational changes are central to the function of many proteins. Characterization of these changes using molecular simulation requires methods to effectively sample pathways between protein conformational states. In this paper we present an iterative algorithm that samples conformational transitions in protein loops, referred to as the Jacobian-based Loop Transition (JaLT) algorithm. The method uses internal coordinates to minimise the sampling space, while Cartesian coordinates are used to maintain loop closure. Information from the two representations is combined to push sampling towards a desired target conformation. The innovation that enables the simultaneous use of Cartesian coordinates and internal coordinate is the linearisation of the inverse kinematics of a protein backbone. The algorithm uses the Rosetta all-atom energy function to steer sampling through low-energy regions and uses Rosettas side-chain energy minimiser to update side-chain conformations along the way. Because the JaLT algorithm combines a detailed energy function with a low-dimensional conformational space, it is positioned in between molecular dynamics (MD) and elastic network model (ENM) methods. As a proof of principle, we apply the JaLT algorithm to study the conformational transition between the open and occluded state in the MET20 loop of the Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase enzyme. Our results show that the algorithm generates semi-continuous pathways between the two states with realistic energy profiles. These pathways can be used to identify energy barriers along the transition. The effect of a single point mutation of the MET20 loop was also investigated and the predicted increase in energy barrier is consistent with the experimentally observed reduction in catalytic rate of the enzyme. Additionally, it is demonstrated how the JaLT algorithm can be used to identify dominant degrees of freedom during a transition. This can be valuable input for a more extensive characterization of the free energy pathway along a transition using molecular dynamics, which is often performed with a reduced set of degrees of freedom. This study has thereby provided the first examples of how linearisation of inverse kinematics can be applied to the analysis of proteins.",

    "abstract": "Quantifying the proportion of the different cell types present in tumor biopsies remains a priority in cancer research. So far, a number of deconvolution methods have emerged for estimating cell composition using reference signatures, either based on gene expression or on DNA methylation from purified cells. These two deconvolution approaches could be complementary to each other, leading to even more performant signatures, in cases where both data types are available. However, the potential relationship between signatures based on gene expression and those based on DNA methylation remains underexplored.\n\nHere we present five new deconvolution signature matrices, based RNAseq data or on DNA methylation, which can estimate the proportion of immune cells and cancer cells in a tumour sample. We test these signature matrices on available datasets for in-silico and in-vitro mixtures, peripheral blood, cancer samples from TCGA, and a single-cell melanoma dataset. Cell proportions estimates based on deconvolution performed using our signature matrices, implemented within the EpiDISH framework, show comparable or better correlation with FACS measurements of immune cell-type abundance and with various estimates of cancer sample purity and composition than existing methods.\n\nUsing publicly available data of 3D chromatin structure in haematopoietic cells, we expanded the list of genes to be included in the RNAseq signature matrices by considering the presence of methylated CpGs in gene promoters or in genomic regions which are in 3D contact with these promoters. Our expanded signature matrices have improved performance compared to our initial RNAseq signature matrix. Finally, we show the value of our signatures in predicting patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in three melanoma cancer cohorts, based on bulk tumour sample gene expression.\n\nWe also provide GEM-DeCan: a snakemake pipeline, able to run an analysis from raw sequencing data to deconvolution based on various gene expression signature matrices, both for bulk RNASeq and DNA methylation data.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundShort-read whole genome sequencing (WGS) is a vital tool for clinical applications and basic research. Genetic divergence from the reference genome, repetitive sequences, and sequencing bias, reduce the performance of variant calling using short-read alignment, but the loss in recall and specificity has not been adequately characterized. For the clonal pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), researchers frequently exclude 10.7% of the genome believed to be repetitive and prone to erroneous variant calls. To benchmark short-read variant calling, we used 36 diverse clinical Mtb isolates dually sequenced with Illumina short-reads and PacBio long-reads. We systematically study the short-read variant calling accuracy and the influence of sequence uniqueness, reference bias, and GC content. [a]\n\nResultsReference based Illumina variant calling had a recall [&ge;]89.0% and precision [&ge;]98.5% across parameters evaluated. The best balance between precision and recall was achieved by tuning the mapping quality (MQ) threshold, i.e. confidence of the read mapping (recall 85.8%, precision 99.1% at MQ [&ge;] 40). Masking repetitive sequence content is an alternative conservative approach to variant calling that maintains high precision (recall 70.2%, precision 99.6% at MQ[&ge;]40). Of the genomic positions typically excluded for Mtb, 68% are accurately called using Illumina WGS including 52 of the 168 PE/PPE genes (34.5%). We present a refined list of low confidence regions and examine the largest sources of variant calling error.\n\nConclusionsOur improved approach to variant calling has broad implications for the use of WGS in the study of Mtb biology, inference of transmission in public health surveillance systems, and more generally for WGS applications in other organisms.",

    "abstract": "Malignant melanoma (MM) develops from the melanocytes and in its advanced stage is the most aggressive type of skin cancer. Here we report a comprehensive analysis on a prospective cohort study, including non-tumor, primary and metastasis tissues (n=77) with the corresponding plasma samples (n=56) from patients with malignant melanoma. The tumors and surrounding tissues were characterized with a combination of high-throughput analyses including quantitative proteomics, phosphoproteomics, acetylomics, and whole exome sequencing (WES) combined with in-depth histopathology analysis. Melanoma cell proliferation highly correlates with dysregulation at the proteome, at the posttranslational- and at the transcriptome level. Some of the changes were also verified in the plasma proteome. The metabolic reprogramming in melanoma includes upregulation of the glycolysis and the oxidative phosphorylation, and an increase in glutamine consumption, while downregulated proteins involved in the degradation of amino acids, fatty acids, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interaction. The pathways most dysregulated in MM including the MAP kinases-, the PI3K-AKT signaling, and the calcium homeostasis, are among the most affected by mutations, thus, dysregulation in these pathways can be manifested as drivers in melanoma development and progression.\n\nThe phosphoproteome analysis combined with target-based prediction mapped 75% of the human kinome. Melanoma cell proliferation was driven by two key factors: i) metabolic reprogramming leading to upregulation of the glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, supported by HIF-1 signaling pathway and mitochondrial translation; and ii) a dysregulation of the immune system response, which was mirrored by immune system processes in the plasma proteome. Regulation of the melanoma acetylome and expression of deacetylase enzymes discriminated between groups based on tissue origin and proliferation, indicating a way to guide the successful use of HDAC inhibitors in melanoma. The disease progression toward metastasis is driven by the downregulation of the immune system response, including MHC class I and II, which allows tumors to evade immune surveillance. Altogether, new evidence is provided at different molecular levels to allow improved understanding of the melanoma progression, ultimately contributing to better treatment strategies.\n\nTOC figure\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=157 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/439245v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (58K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@937db9org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1230b57org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1bd889eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@547d90_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

    "abstract": "NOTCH1 is a recurrently mutated gene in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL). Functional studies to investigate its role have been hampered by the inability to genetically manipulate primary human lymphoma cells, attributed to low transduction-efficacy and procedure-associated toxicity. To overcome these limitations, we have developed a novel method to retrovirally transfer genes into malignant human B cells. We generated isogenic human tumor cells from patients with CLL and MCL, differing only in their expression of NOTCH1. Our data demonstrate that NOTCH1 facilitates immune-escape of malignant B cells by up-regulating PD-L1, partly dependent on autocrine interferon-{gamma} signaling. In addition, NOTCH1 causes silencing of the entire HLA-class II locus via suppression of the transcriptional co-activator CIITA. These NOTCH1-mediated immune escape mechanisms are associated with the expansion of CD4+ T cells in vivo, further contributing to the poor clinical outcome of NOTCH1-mutated CLL and MCL.",

    "abstract": "Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is characterized by lung injury, cytokine storm and increased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR). Current therapies focus on reducing viral replication and inflammatory responses, but no specific treatment exists to prevent the development of severe Covid-19 in infected individuals. Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 ACE-2) is the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing Covid-19, but it is also critical for maintaining the correct functionality of lung epithelium and endothelium. Coronaviruses induce activation of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 17 (ADAM17) and shedding of ACE-2 from the cell surface resulting in exacerbated inflammatory responses. Thus, we hypothesized that ADAM17 inhibition ameliorates Covid-19-related lung inflammation. We employed a pre-clinical mouse model using intra-tracheal instillation of a combination of polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly-I:C) and the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (RBD-S) to mimic lung damage associated with Covid-19. Histological analysis of inflamed mice confirmed the expected signs of lung injury including edema, fibrosis, vascular congestion and leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, inflamed mice also showed an increased NLR as observed in critically ill Covid-19 patients. Administration of the ADAM17 inhibitors apratastat and TMI-1 significantly improved lung histology and prevented leukocyte infiltration. Reduced leukocyte recruitment could be explained by reduced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and lower levels of the endothelial adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Additionally, the NLR was significantly reduced by ADAM17 inhibition. Thus, we propose inhibition of ADAM17 as a novel promising treatment strategy in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals to prevent the progression towards severe Covid-19.",

    "abstract": "This research study utilized a light-sensitive drug, nifedipine (NFD), to understand the impact of processing parameters, and formulation composition on drug degradation, crystallinity, and quality attributes (dimensions, hardness, disintegration time) of selective laser sintering (SLS) based 3D printed dosage forms. Selective laser sintering (SLS), in most cases, uses an ultraviolet laser source, and drugs tend to absorb radiation at varying intensities around this wavelength (455 nm). This phenomenon may lead to chemical degradation, and solid-state transformation, which was assessed for nifedipine in formulations with varying amounts of vinyl pyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (Kollidon(R) VA 64) and potassium aluminum silicate-based pearlescent pigment (Candurin(R)), processed under different SLS conditions in the presented work. After preliminary screening Candurin(R), surface temperature (ST), and laser speed (LS) were identified as the significant independent variables. Further, using the identified independent variables a 17-run, randomized, Box-Behnken design was developed to understand the correlation trends and quantify the impact on degradation (%), crystallinity, quality attributes (dimensions, hardness, disintegration time) employing qualitative and quantitative analytical tools. The design of experiments (DoE) and statistical analysis observed that LS and Candurin(R) (%wt) had a strong negative correlation on drug degradation, hardness, and weight, whereas ST had a strong positive correlation with, drug degradation, amorphous conversion, and hardness of the 3D printed dosage form. From this study, it can be concluded that formulation and processing parameters have a critical impact on stability and performance; hence these parameters should be evaluated and optimized before exposing light-sensitive drugs to the SLS processes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=126 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/439089v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (19K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e3dd02org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c2bfaforg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1b6b712org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ad35fd_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

Many studies are limited by the lack of access to appropriate cellular models. As the airway epithelium is the primary site of infection it is essential to study SARS-CoV-2 infection of these cells. Here, we examined human airway epithelium, grown as highly differentiated air-liquid interface cultures and infected with three different isolates of SARS-CoV-2 including the B.1.1.7 variant (Variant of Concern 202012/01) by transmission electron microscopy and tomography. For all isolates, the virus infected ciliated but not goblet epithelial cells. Two key SARS-CoV-2 entry molecules, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, were found to be localised to the plasma membrane including microvilli but excluded from cilia. Consistent with these observations, extracellular virions were frequently seen associated with microvilli and the apical plasma membrane but rarely with ciliary membranes. Profiles indicative of viral fusion at the apical plasma membrane demonstrate that the plasma membrane is one site of entry where direct fusion releasing the nucleoprotein-encapsidated genome occurs. Intact intracellular virions were found within ciliated cells in compartments with a single membrane bearing S glycoprotein. Profiles strongly suggesting viral budding from the membrane was observed in these compartments and this may explain how virions gain their S glycoprotein containing envelope.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 pandemic has caused millions of death globally and caused huge impact on the health of infected patients. Shift in the lung microbial ecology upon such viral infection often worsens the disease and increases host susceptibility to secondary infections. Recent studies have indicated that bacterial coinfection is an unignorable factor contributing to the aggravation of COVID-19 and posing great challenge to clinical treatments. However, there is still a lack of in-depth investigation on the coinfecting bacteria in COVID-19 patients for better treatment of bacterial coinfection. With the knowledge that Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the top coinfecting pathogens, we analyzed the adaptation and convergent evolution of nosocomial P. aeruginosa isolated from two critical COVID-19 patients in this study. We sequenced and compared the genomes and transcriptomes of P. aeruginosa isolates longitudinally and parallelly for its evolutionary traits. P. aeruginosa overexpressed alginate and attenuated Type VI secretion system (T6SS) during coinfection for excessive biofilm formation and suppressed virulence. Results of bacterial competition assay and macrophage cytotoxicity test indicated that P. aeruginosa reduced its virulence towards both prokaryotic competitors and eukaryotic host through inhibiting its T6SS during evolution. P. aeuginosa T6SS is thus one of the reasons for its advantage to cause coinfection in COVID-19 patients while the attenuation of T6SS could cause a shift in the microecological composition in the lung. Our study will contribute to the development of therapeutic measures and the discovery of novel drug target to eliminate P. aeruginosa coinfection in COVID-19 patient.",

Several crystal structures have now been reported in this family, but the functional relevance of such models remains unclear. Here, we used small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) to probe ambient solution-phase properties of the pH-gated bacterial ion channel GLIC under resting and activating conditions. Data collection was optimized by inline paused-flow size-exclusion chromatography, and exchanging into deuterated detergent to hide the micelle contribution. Resting-state GLIC was the best-fit crystal structure to SANS curves, with no evidence for divergent mechanisms. Moreover, enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics simulations enabled differential modeling in resting versus activating conditions, with the latter corresponding to an intermediate ensemble of both the extracellular and transmembrane domains. This work demonstrates state-dependent changes in a pentameric ion channel by SANS, an increasingly accessible method for macromolecular characterization with the coming generation of neutron sources.",

Here, we established a physiologically-relevant in vitro TAM polarization system that recapitulates TAM pro-tumoral activities. We used this system for phenotypic kinase inhibitor screening and identified a multi-targeted compound BMS-794833 as the most potent inhibitor of TAM polarization. BMS-794833 decreased pro-tumoral properties of TAMs and suppressed tumor growth in mouse triple-negative breast cancer models. The effect of BMS-794833 was not dependent on its primary targets (MET and VEGFR2) but on its effect on multiple signaling pathways, including focal adhesion kinases, SRC family kinases, STAT3, and p38 MAP kinases. Our study underlines the efficacy of polypharmacological strategies in re-programming complex signaling cascades activated during TAM polarization.",

The readout mechanism makes use of resonance absorption of ultrasound waves in glucose-sensitive hydrogels. Changes in in vivo glucose concentration in the interstitial tissue lead to swelling and de-swelling of the gels which in turn lead to changes in resonance behavior. The hydrogels are designed and shaped such as to exhibit specific mechanical resonance frequencies while remaining sonolucent to other frequencies. Thus, they allow conventional and continued ultrasound imaging, while yielding a sensing signal at specific frequencies that is correlated with glucose concentration. The resonance frequencies can be tuned by changing the shape and mechanical properties of the gel structures, such as to allow for multiple, co-located implanted hydrogels with different sensing characteristics or targets to be employed and read out, without interference, using the same ultrasound transducer, by simply toggling frequencies. The fact that there is no need for any implantable electronics, also opens the path towards future use of biodegradable hydrogels, thus creating a platform that allows injection of sensors that do not need to be retrieved when they reach the end of their useful lifespan.",

We assessed vascular function of young and old mesenteric arteries in vitro using wire myography. We also performed bulk RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests in mesenteric arteries and perivascular adipose tissue to elucidate molecular underpinnings of age-related phenotypes. Results revealed impaired perivascular adipose tissue-mediated control of vascular tone particularly via KV7.3-5 channels with increased age through metabolic and inflammatory processes and release of perivascular adipose tissue-derived relaxation factors. Moreover, QO58 was identified as novel pharmacological vasodilator to activate XE991-sensitive KCNQ channels in old mesenteric arteries.

    "abstract": "Roots are central to the function of natural and agricultural ecosystems by driving plant acquisition of soil resources and influencing the carbon cycle. Root characteristics like length, diameter, and volume are critical to measure to understand plant and soil functions. RhizoVision Explorer is an open-source software designed to enable researchers interested in roots by providing an easy-to-use interface, fast image processing, and reliable measurements. The default broken roots mode is intended for roots sampled from pots or soil cores, washed, and typically scanned on a flatbed scanner, and provides measurements like length, diameter, and volume. The optional whole root mode for complete root systems or root crowns provides additional measurements such as angles, root depth, and convex hull. Both modes support providing measurements grouped by defined diameter ranges, the inclusion of multiple regions of interest, and batch analysis. RhizoVision Explorer was successfully validated against ground truth data using a novel copper wire image set. In comparison, the current reference software, the commercial WinRhizo, drastically underestimated volume when wires of different diameters were in the same image. Additionally, measurements were compared with WinRhizo and IJ_Rhizo using a simulated root image set, showing general agreement in software measurements, except for root volume. Finally, scanned root image sets acquired in different labs for the crop, herbaceous, and tree species were used to compare results from RhizoVision Explorer with WinRhizo. The two software showed general agreement, except that WinRhizo substantially underestimated root volume relative to RhizoVision Explorer. In the current context of rapidly growing interest in root science, RhizoVision Explorer intends to become a reference software, improve the overall accuracy and replicability of root trait measurements, and provide a foundation for collaborative improvement and reliable access to all.\n\nO_FIG_DISPLAY_L [Figure 1] M_FIG_DISPLAY C_FIG_DISPLAY",

    "abstract": "Patients with drug-resistant epilepsy can experience respiratory alterations notably during seizures. The mechanisms underlying this long-term alteration of respiratory function remain unclear. This study aimed at determining in rats whether epilepsy is associated with alterations of both the respiratory function and brainstem serotonin (5-HT) system. Epilepsy was triggered by pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus in rats. 30-50% of epileptic (EPI) rats exhibited sharp decrease of oxygen consumption (SDOC), low metabolic rate of oxygen and slow regular ventilation; these rats were called EPI/SDOC+ rats. These alterations were only detected in rats with chronic epilepsy, independent of behavioral seizures, persisted over the time, and were not associated with death. In these rats, 5-HT fiber density in the nucleus tractus solitarius was below that of control and EPI/SDOC-rats. Both EPI/SDOC+ rats and DBA/2 mice presenting with fatal respiratory arrest following an audiogenic-induced seizure, a model of sudden and expected death in epilepsy, had increased transcript levels of tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (p<0.001 for both strains) and 5-HT presynaptic transporter (rats: p=0.003; mice: p=0.001). Thus, our data support that 5-HT alterations are associated with chronic and acute epilepsy-related respiratory dysfunctions.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWWe are exquisitely sensitive to the microstructure and material properties of surfaces. In the peripheral nerves, two separate mechanisms convey texture information: coarse textural features are encoded in spatial patterns of activation that reflect their spatial layout and fine features are encoded in highly repeatable, texture specific temporal spiking patterns evoked as the skin moves across the surface. In the present study, we examined whether this temporal code is preserved in the responses of neurons in somatosensory cortex. To this end, we scanned a diverse set of everyday textures across the fingertip of awake macaques while recording the responses evoked in individual cortical neurons. We found that temporal spiking patterns are highly repeatable across multiple presentations of the same texture, with millisecond precision. As a result, texture identity can be reliably decoded from the temporal patterns themselves, even after information carried in the spike rates is eliminated. However, the combination of rate and timing does is more informative than either code in isolation. The temporal precision of the texture response is heterogenous across cortical neurons and depends on the submodality composition of their input and on their location along the somatosensory neuraxis. Furthermore, temporal spiking patterns in cortex dilate and contract with decreases and increases in scanning speed and this systematic relationship between speed and patterning may contribute to the observed perceptual invariance to speed. Finally, we find that the quality of a texture percept can be better predicted when these temporal patterns are taken into consideration. We conclude that high-precision spike timing complements rate-based signals to encode texture in somatosensory cortex.",

    "abstract": "Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is a powerful form of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation capable of suppressing cortical excitability for up to 50 min. A growing number of studies have applied cTBS to the visual cortex in human subjects to investigate the neural dynamics of visual processing, but few have specifically examined its effects on central vision, which has crucial implications for safety and inference on downstream cognitive effects. The present study assessed the safety of offline, neuronavigated cTBS to V2 by examining its effects on central vision performance. In this single-blind, randomized sham-controlled, crossover study, 17 healthy adults received cTBS (at 80% active motor threshold) and sham to V2 1-2 weeks apart. Their central vision ([&le;]8{degrees}) was tested at 1-min (T1) and again at 50-min (T50) post-stimulation. Effects of condition (cTBS vs. sham) and time (T1 vs. T50) on accuracy and reaction time were examined using Bayes factor. Bayes factor results suggested that cTBS did not impair stimulus detection over the entire central visual field nor subfields at T1 or T50. Our results offer the first explicit evidence supporting that cTBS applied to V2 does not create blind spots in the central visual field in humans during a simple detection task. Any subtler changes to vision and downstream visual perception should be investigated in future studies.",

    "abstract": "Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has significantly improved the prognosis of cancer patients, but the majority experience limited benefit, evidencing the need for new therapeutic approaches. Upregulation of sialic acid-containing glycans, termed hypersialylation, is a common feature of cancer-associated glycosylation, driving disease progression and immune escape via the engagement of Siglec-receptors on tumor-infiltrating immune cells. Here, we show that tumor sialylation correlates with distinct immune states and reduced survival in human cancers. The targeted removal of Siglec-ligands in the tumor microenvironment, using an antibody-sialidase conjugate, enhances anti-tumor immunity and halts tumor progression in several mouse tumor models. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we reveal desialylation mechanistically to repolarize tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and identify Siglec-E on TAMs as the main receptor for hypersialylation. Finally, we show genetic and therapeutic desialylation, as well as loss of Siglec-E, to synergize with ICB. Thus, therapeutic desialylation represents a novel immunotherapeutic approach, shaping macrophage phenotypes and augmenting the adaptive anti-tumor immune response.",

We have constructed a novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, CoVac501, which is a self-adjuvanting peptide vaccine conjugated with Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonists. The vaccine contains two immunodominant peptides screened from receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is fully chemically synthesized. And the vaccine has optimized nanoemulsion formulation, outstanding stability and safety. In non-human primates (NHPs), CoVac501 elicited high and persistent titers of RBD-specific and protective neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which were also effective to RBD mutations. CoVac501 was found to elicit the increase of memory T cells, antigen-specific CD8+ T cell responses and Th1-biased CD4+ T cell immune responses in NHPs. More importantly, the sera from the immunized NHPs can prevent infection of live SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.\n\nOne-Sentence SummaryA novel SARS-CoV-2 vaccine we developed, CoVac501, which is a fully chemically synthesized and self-adjuvanting peptides conjugated with TLR7 agonists, can induce high-efficient humoral and cellular immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "Although vaccines have been successfully developed and approved against SARS-CoV-2, it is still valuable to perform studies on conserved antigenic sites for preventing possible pandemic-risk of other SARS-like coronavirus in the future and prevalent SARS-CoV-2 variants. By antibodies obtained from convalescent COVID-19 individuals, receptor binding domain (RBD) were identified as immunodominant neutralizing domain that efficiently elicits neutralizing antibody response with on-going affinity mature. Moreover, we succeeded to define a quantitative antigenic map of neutralizing sites within SARS-CoV-2 RBD, and found that sites S2, S3 and S4 (new-found site) are conserved sites and determined as subimmunodominant sites, putatively due to their less accessibility than SARS-CoV-2 unique sites. P10-6G3, P07-4D10 and P05-6H7, respectively targeting S2, S3 and S4, are relatively rare antibodies that also potently neutralizes SARS-CoV, and the last mAbs performing neutralization without blocking S protein binding to receptor. Further, we have tried to design some RBDs to improve the immunogenicity of conserved sites. Our studies, focusing on conserved antigenic sites of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, provide insights for promoting development of universal SARS-like coronavirus vaccines therefore enhancing our pandemic preparedness.",

Brevibacillin 2V has strong antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacterial pathogens, including difficult-to-treat antibiotic-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Notably, brevibacillin 2V has a much lower hemolytic activity to eukaryotic cells than previously reported NRPs of the lipo-tridecapeptide family, including other brevibacillins, which makes it a promising candidate for antibiotic development. In addition, our results demonstrate that brevibacillins display synergistic action with established antibiotics against Gram-negative bacterial pathogens. Thus, we identified and characterized a novel and promising antibiotic candidate (brevibacillin 2V) with a low hemolytic activity, which can be used either on its own or as a template for further total synthesis and modification.",

To explore the effect of crowding in a well-characterized model cytoplasm we developed methods to selectively concentrate components larger than 25 kDa from Xenopus egg extracts. When crowding was increased 1.4x, the egg cytoplasm demixed into two liquid phases of approximately equal volume. One of the phases was highly enriched in glycogen while the other had a higher protein concentration. Glycogen hydrolysis blocked or reversed demixing. Quantitative proteomics showed that the glycogen phase was enriched in proteins that bind glycogen, participate in carbohydrate metabolism, or are in complexes with especially high native molecular weight. The glycogen phase was depleted of ribosomes, ER and mitochondria. These results inform on the physical nature of a glycogen-rich cytoplasm and suggest a role of demixing in the localization of glycogen particles in tissue cells.",

    "abstract": "The mechanism of conversion of the human sperm basal body to a centrosome after fertilization, and its role in supporting human early embryogenesis has not been directly addressed so far. Using proteomics and immunofluorescence studies we show here that the human zygote inherits a basal body enriched with centrosomal proteins from the sperm, establishing the first functional centrosome of the new organism. Injection of human sperm tails containing the basal body into human oocytes followed by parthenogenetically activation, showed that the centrosome contributes to the robustness of the early cell divisions, increasing the probability of parthenotes reaching the compaction stage. In the absence of the sperm-derived centrosome, pericentriolar (PCM) components stored in the oocyte can form de novo structures after genome activation, suggesting a tight PCM expression control in zygotes. Our results reveal that the sperm basal body is a complex organelle which converts to a centrosome after fertilization, ensuring the early steps of embryogenesis and successful compaction. However, more experiments are needed to elucidate the exact molecular mechanisms of centrosome inheritance in humans.",

Deep-sea macrofauna from the DeSoto Canyon in the northern Gulf of Mexico were sampled annually from 2012 through 2014 from five stations within the Canyon and from two stations in 2013 and 2014 on the adjacent open slope, for analysis of interannual dynamics, temporal variability, and potential influence of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (DwH), which occurred nearby in 2010. At a few sites, elevated abundance was observed at the start of the time-series for overall macrofauna and for deposit feeder abundance. However, diversity metrics showed no difference within stations among time points. Community and feeding guild structure varied by station, as expected, but showed no statistical difference among time points within a station. Some temporal variability was visible in temporal trajectory overlays. Cluster analyses showed grouping more by station than by time point. Metrics utilized for measuring potential oil contamination impact and overall community stress including the benthic polychaete/amphipod ratio, feeding guild abundance, macrofaunal indicators designed from the DwH, and community dispersion, generally exhibited a paucity of evidence of impact, both yearly and with site-to-site comparisons. This suggests low levels of impact in the canyon consistent with the low deposition of hydrocarbons, the timing of sampling, and quick recovery of canyon foraminifera. Taken together these results suggest relatively low levels of temporal variability within the DeSoto Canyon macrofauna with little evidence of oil influence on these sites within the studied time range.",

    "abstract": "Eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis was responsible for the spread of chloroplast (plastid) organelles. Stability is required for the metabolic and genetic integration that drives the establishment of new organelles, yet the mechanisms which act to stabilise nascent endosymbioses - between two fundamentally selfish biological organisms - are unclear. Theory suggests that enforcement mechanisms, which punish misbehaviour, may act to stabilise such interactions by resolving conflict. However, how such mechanisms can emerge in a nascent endosymbiosis has yet to be explored. Here, we propose that endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA interactions, arising from digestion of the endosymbiont population, can result in a cost to host growth for breakdown of the endosymbiosis. Using the model nascent endosymbiosis, Paramecium bursaria - Chlorella spp., we demonstrate that this mechanism is dependent on the host RNA-interference (RNAi) system. We reveal through small RNA (sRNA) sequencing that endosymbiont-derived mRNA released upon endosymbiont digestion can be processed by the host RNAi system into 23-nt sRNA. We predict multiple regions of shared sequence identity between endosymbiont and host mRNA, and demonstrate through delivery of synthetic endosymbiont sRNA that exposure to these regions can knock-down expression of complementary host genes, resulting in a cost to host growth. This process of host gene knock-down in response to endosymbiont-derived RNA processing by host RNAi factors, which we term  RNAi-collisions, represents a mechanism which can promote stability in a nascent eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis. By imposing a cost for breakdown of the endosymbiosis, endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA interactions may drive maintenance of the symbiosis across fluctuating ecological conditions and symbiotic status.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTStable endosymbiosis between eukaryotic microbes has driven the evolution of further cellular complexity. Yet the mechanisms which can act to stabilise a nascent eukaryote-eukaryote endosymbiosis are unclear. Using the model nascent endosymbiotic system, Paramecium bursaria-Chlorella, we demonstrate that endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA interactions can drive a cost to host growth upon endosymbiont digestion, punishing the host for misbehaviour. These RNA-RNA interactions are facilitated by the host RNA-interference system. For endosymbiont mRNA sharing a high-level of sequence identity with host transcripts, this process can result in host gene knock-down. We propose that these endosymbiont-host RNA-RNA interactions- RNAi collisions-represent a viable enforcement mechanism to sanction the host for breakdown of the endosymbiosis, promoting the stability of a nascent endosymbiotic interaction.",

However, a key barrier to adaptive introgression is that recombination can break down combinations of alleles that underpin many traits.

Here, we study the evolution of a large supergene region that determines a major social and ecological trait in Solenopsis fire ants: whether colonies have one queen or multiple queens. Using coalescent-based phylogenies built from the genomes of 365 haploid fire ant males, we show that the supergene variant responsible for multiple-queen colonies evolved in one species and repeatedly spread to other species through introgressive hybridization. This finding highlights how supergene architecture can enable a complex adaptive phenotype to recurrently permeate species boundaries.",

    "abstract": "The evolution of diverse phenotypes both involves and is constrained by molecular interaction networks. When these networks influence patterns of expression, we refer to them as gene regulatory networks (GRNs). Here, we develop a quasi-species model of GRN evolution. With this model, we prove that-across a broad spectrum of viability and mutation functions-the dynamics converge to a stationary distribution over GRNs. Next, we show from first principles how the frequency of GRNs at equilibrium will be proportional to each GRNs eigenvector centrality in the genotype network. Finally, we determine the structural characteristics of GRNs that are favored in response to a range of selective environments and mutational constraints. Our work connects GRN evolution to quasi-species models, and thus can provide a mechanistic explanation for the topology of GRNs experiencing various evolutionary forces.",

    "abstract": "Cell intercalation is a key cell behaviour of morphogenesis and wound healing, where local cell neighbour exchanges can cause dramatic tissue deformations such as body axis extension. Here, we develop a mechanical model to understand active cell intercalation behaviours in the context of an epithelial tissue. Extending existing descriptions, such as vertex models, the junctional actomyosin cortex of every cell is modelled as a continuum morphoelastic rod, explicitly representing cortices facing each other at bicellular junctions. Cells are described directly in terms of the key subcellular constituents that drive dynamics, with localised stresses from the contractile actomyosin cortex and adhesion molecules coupling apposed cortices. This multi-scale apposed-cortex formulation reveals key behaviours that drive tissue dynamics, such as cell-cell shearing and flow of junctional material past cell vertices. We show that cell neighbour exchanges can be driven by purely junctional mechanisms. Active contractility and viscous turnover in a single bicellular junction are sufficient to shrink and remove a junction. Next, the 4-way vertex is resolved and a new, orthogonal junction extends passively. The adhesion timescale defines a frictional viscosity that is an important regulator of these dynamics, modulating tension transmission in the tissue as well as the speeds of junction shrinkage and growth. The model additionally predicts that rosettes, which form when a vertex becomes common to many cells, are likely to occur in active tissues with high adhesive friction.\n\nSIGNIFICANCECell intercalation, or neighbour exchange, is a crucial behaviour that can drive tissue deformations, dissipate stress and facilitate wound healing. Substantial experimental work has identified the key molecular players facilitating intercalation, but there remains a lack of consensus and understanding of their physical roles. Existing biophysical models that represent cell-cell contacts with single edges cannot study the continuous dynamics of intercalation, involving shear between coupled cell cortices. Deriving a continuum description of the cell cortex, explicitly coupling neighbouring cortices with adhesions, we define the biophysical conditions required for successful neighbour exchanges. Furthermore, we show how the turnover of adhesion molecules specifies a viscous friction that regulates active tissue dynamics.",

    "abstract": "The microtubule-associated protein, tau, is the major subunit of neurofibrillary tangles, forming insoluble, amyloid-type aggregates associated with neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimers disease. Tau aggregation, however, can be prevented in the cell by a class of proteins known as molecular chaperones, which play important roles in maintaining protein homeostasis. While numerous chaperones are known to interact with tau, though, little is known about the detailed mechanisms by which these prevent tau aggregation. Here, we describe the effects of the ATP-independent Hsp40 chaperones, DNAJA2 and DNAJB1, on tau amyloid fiber formation and compare these to the well-studied small heat shock protein HSPB1. We find that each chaperone prevents tau aggregation differently, by interacting with distinct sets of tau species along the aggregation pathway and thereby affecting their incorporation into fibers. Whereas HSPB1 only binds tau monomers, DNAJB1 and DNAJA2 recognize aggregation-prone tau conformers and even mature fibers, thus efficiently preventing formation of tau amyloids. In addition, we find that both Hsp40s bind tau seeds and fibers via their C-terminal domain II (CTDII), with DNAJA2 being further capable of recognizing tau monomers by a second, different site in CTDI. These results provide important insight into the molecular mechanism by which the different members of the Hsp40 chaperone family counteract the formation, propagation, and toxicity of tau aggregates. Furthermore, our findings highlight the fact that chaperones from different families and different classes play distinct, but complementary roles in preventing pathological protein aggregation.",

However, our knowledge of the 3D structure, and development of these plants is still rudimentary. Here we used digital 3D reconstruction techniques to produce the first complete reconstruction of the lycopsid Asteroxylon mackiei, the most complex plant in the Rhynie chert. The reconstruction reveals the organisation of the three distinct axes types - leafy shoot axes, root-bearing axes and rooting axes - in the body plan. Combining this reconstruction with developmental data from fossilised meristems, we demonstrate that the A. mackiei rooting axis - a transitional lycophyte organ between the rootless ancestral state and true roots - developed from root-bearing axes by anisotomous dichotomy. Our discovery demonstrates how this unique organ developed, and highlights the value of evidence-based reconstructions for understanding the development and evolution of the first complex plants on Earth.",

    "abstract": "When C4 leaves are exposed to low light, CO2 concentration in the bundle sheath (BS) cells decreases, causing an increase in photorespiration relative to assimilation, and a consequent reduction in biochemical efficiency. These effects can be mitigated by complex acclimation syndromes, which are of primary importance for crop productivity, but not well studied. We unveil an acclimation strategy involving regulation of electron transport processes. Firstly, we characterise anatomy, gas-exchange and electron transport of C4 Setaria viridis grown under low light. Through a purposely developed biochemical model, we resolve the photon fluxes and reaction rates to explain how the concerted acclimation strategies sustain photosynthetic efficiency. Our results show that a smaller BS in low light-grown plants limited leakiness (the ratio of CO2 leak rate out of the BS over the rate of supply via C4 acid decarboxylation) but sacrificed light harvesting and ATP production. To counter ATP shortage and maintain high assimilation rates, plants facilitated light penetration through the mesophyll and upregulated cyclic electron flow in the BS. This shade tolerance mechanism based on optimisation of light reactions is potentially more efficient than the known mechanisms involving the rearrangement of carbon metabolism, and can potentially lead to innovative strategies for crop improvement.\n\nSignificanceWe mechanistically link the optical cross-section of leaf compartments with the rate of electron transport, the engagement of cyclic electron flow, the relative rate of ATP and NADPH generation, and fluxes through the carbon metabolism. The striking capacity of Setaria viridis to counter the decrease in light absorption in the bundle sheath with an increase of cyclic electron flow presents perhaps the most efficient mechanism of shade acclimation.",

    "abstract": "Foraging, pursuit, and predation rapidly transition into behavioral quiescence during reward capture and consumption. While appetitive-consummatory dissociations are embedded at both psychological and neural levels, the mechanisms controlling switches or transitions between appetitive seeking and consummatory behaviors remain poorly understood. Here we identify the BLA[-&gt;]AcbSh pathway as critical to these transitions by showing that this pathway inhibits the appetitive seeking response in the presence of consummatory demands. Using an appetitive cue-discrimination task in male rats, we show that reward delivery is a significant driver of seeking inhibition and that a BLA[-&gt;]AcbSh pathway mediates this inhibition. This role in suppressing seeking responses during periods of consumption was not due to a general suppression of behavior because responding to other cues during the same test was unaffected. Moreover, it was specific to the BLA[-&gt;]AcbSh pathway, because the contribution of the BLA[-&gt;]AcbC pathway to appetitive switching was distinct and modest. State-dependent silencing of BLA[-&gt;]AcbSh revealed that the modulation of seeking before and after reward delivery are co-dependent. Finally, we found that BLA terminals in AcbSh have functional connectivity to LH-projecting AcbSh neurons, thereby identifying a BLA[-&gt;]AcbSh[-&gt;]LH pathway as a putative route for the rapid regulation of appetitive behaviors. Taken together, these findings suggest that the BLA[-&gt;]AcbSh pathway is a core component of an appetitive switching system, recruited under conditions requiring rapid or dynamic shifts in appetitive behavior, and that this pathway enables these shifts by actively inhibiting seeking.\n\nSignificance statementForaging, pursuit, and predation quickly transition into behavioral quiescence during reward capture and consumption. These transitions are critical for flexible and responsive sequences of behavior. Here we show that behavioral transitions are actively controlled at the limbic-striatal interface. We identify reward receipt as a proximal trigger for transition between reward seeking and taking, we identify active inhibition as the functional operation of this transition, and we identify the basolateral amygdala[-&gt;]accumbens shell pathway as critical to this functional operation.",

Little is known about how flying animals utilize wing mechanosensation to monitor the dynamic state of their highly deformable wings. Odonata, dragonflies and damselflies, are a basal lineage of flying insects with excellent flight performance, and their wing mechanics have been studied extensively. Here, we present a comprehensive map of the wing sensory system for two Odonata species, including both the external sensor morphologies and internal neuroanatomy. We identified eight morphological classes of sensors; most were mechanosensors innervated by a single neuron. Their innervation patterns and morphologies minimize axon length and allow morphological latency compensation. We further mapped the major veins of another 13 Odonata species across 10 families and identified consistent sensor distribution patterns, with sensor count scaling with wing length. Finally, we constructed a high-fidelity finite element model of a dragonfly wing for structural analysis. Our dynamic loading simulations revealed features of the strain fields that wing sensor arrays could detect to encode different wing deformation states.

    "abstract": "Early in auditory processing, neural responses faithfully reflect acoustic input. At higher stages of auditory processing, however, neurons become selective for particular call types, eventually leading to specialized regions of cortex that preferentially process calls at the highest auditory processing stages. We previously proposed that an intermediate step in how non-selective responses are transformed into call-selective responses is the detection of informative call features. But how neural selectivity for informative call features emerges from non-selective inputs, whether feature selectivity gradually emerges over the processing hierarchy, and how stimulus information is represented in non-selective and feature-selective populations remain open questions. In this study, using unanesthetized guinea pigs, a highly vocal and social rodent, as an animal model, we characterized the neural representation of calls in three auditory processing stages - the thalamus (vMGB), and thalamorecipient (L4) and superficial layers (L2/3) of primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that neurons in vMGB and A1 L4 did not exhibit call-selective responses and responded throughout the call durations. However, A1 L2/3 neurons showed high call-selectivity with about a third of neurons responding to only one or two call types. These A1 L2/3 neurons only responded to restricted portions of calls suggesting that they were highly selective for call features. Receptive fields of these A1 L2/3 neurons showed complex spectrotemporal structures that could underlie their high call feature selectivity. Information theoretic analysis revealed that in A1 L4 stimulus information was distributed over the population and was spread out over the call durations. In contrast, in A1 L2/3, individual neurons showed brief bursts of high stimulus-specific information, and conveyed high levels of information per spike. These data demonstrate that a transformation in the neural representation of calls occurs between A1 L4 and A1 L2/3, leading to the emergence of a feature-based representation of calls in A1 L2/3. Our data thus suggest that observed cortical specializations for call processing emerge in A1, and set the stage for further mechanistic studies.",

    "abstract": "ST8SIA2 is the main factor regulating expression of the phenotype involved in schizophrenia. Lowered promoter activity of the ST8SIA2 gene is considered to be protective against schizophrenia by conferring tolerance to psychosocial stress. Here, we examined the promoter type composition of anatomically modern humans (AMHs) and archaic humans (AHs; Neanderthals and Denisovans), and compared the promoter activity at the population level (population promoter activity; PPA) between them. In AMHs, the TCT-type, showing the second lowest promoter activity, was most prevalent in the ancestral population of non-Africans. However, the detection of only the CGT-type from AH samples and recombination tracts in AH sequences showed that the CGT- and TGT-types, exhibiting the two highest promoter activities, were common in AH populations. Furthermore, interspecies gene flow occurred into AMHs from AHs and into Denisovans from Neanderthals, influencing promoter-type compositions independently in both AMHs and AHs. The difference of promoter-type composition makes PPA unique in each population. East and Southeast Asian populations show the lowest PPA. This results from the selective increase of the CGC-type, showing the lowest promoter activity, in these populations. Every non-African population shows significantly lower PPA than African populations, resulting from the TCT-type having the highest prevalence in the ancestral population of non-Africans. In addition, PPA reduction is also found among subpopulations within Africa via a slight increase of the TCT-type. These findings indicate a trend toward lower PPA in the spread of AMHs, interpreted as a continuous adaptation to psychosocial stress arising in migration. This trend is considered as genetic tuning for the evolution of collective brains. The inferred promoter-type composition of AHs differed markedly from that of AMHs, resulting in higher PPA in AHs than in AMHs. This suggests that the trend toward lower PPA is a unique feature in AMH spread.",
