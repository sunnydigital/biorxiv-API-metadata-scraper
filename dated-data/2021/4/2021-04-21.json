    "abstract": "Microglia actively promote the growth of high-grade gliomas. Within the glioma microenvironment an activated (amoeboid) microglial morphology has been observed, however the underlying causes and the related impact on microglia functions and their tumour promoting activities is unclear. Using the advantages of the larval zebrafish model, we demonstrate that pre-neoplastic glioma cells have an immediate impact on microglial morphology and functions. Overexpression of human HRasV12 in proliferating domains of the larval brain induces an amoeboid morphology of microglia, increases microglial numbers and decreases their motility and phagocytic activity. RNA sequencing analysis revealed lower expression levels of the actin nucleation promoting factor wasla in microglia. Importantly, a microglia specific rescue of wasla expression restores microglial morphology and functions. This results in increased phagocytosis of pre-neoplastic cells and slows down tumour progression. In conclusion, we identified a mechanism that de-activates core microglial functions within the emerging glioma microenvironment.",

    "abstract": "Omeg@Silica microparticles consisting of whole fish oil rich in omega-3 lipids, vitamin D3 and zeaxanthin extracted with biobased limonene from anchovy fillet leftovers (AnchoisOil) encapsulated within mesoporous silica particles are highly effective in modulating oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage or in promoting antitumor effects in lung cancer cells. A panel of three different human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines (A549, Colo 699 and SKMES) was used. Cancer cells were treated with AnchoisOil dispersed in ethanol (10 and 15 g/ml) or encapsulated in silica, and cell cycle, reactive oxigen species (ROS) and mitochondrial stress (MitoSOX) assessed by flow cytometry. The effects on long-term proliferation (clonogenic assay) were also evaluated. The sub-micron Omeg@Silica microparticles were more effective than fish oil alone in increasing ROS and mitocondrial damage, in altering cell cycle as well as in reducing colony formation ability in the tested lung cancer cell lines. These results suggest that Omeg@Silica mesoporous silica functionalized with whole fish oil has antitumor effects in NSCLC cell lines and support its investigation in lung cancer therapy.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundSimultaneous inhibition of multiple components of the BRAF-MEK-ERK cascade (vertical inhibition) has become a standard of care for treating BRAF-mutant melanoma. However, the molecular mechanism of how vertical inhibition synergistically suppresses intracellular ERK-activity, and consequently cell proliferation, are yet to be fully elucidated.\n\nMethodsWe develop a mechanistic mathematical model that describes how the mutant BRAF-inhibitor, dabrafenib, and the MEK-inhibitor, trametinib, affect BRAFV600E-MEK-ERK signalling. The model is based upon a system of chemical reactions that describes cascade signalling dynamics. Using mass action kinetics, the chemical reactions are re-expressed as ordinary differential equations which are parameterised by in vitro data and solved numerically to obtain the temporal evolution of cascade component concentrations.\n\nResultsThe model provides a quantitative method to compute how dabrafenib and trametinib can be used in combination to synergistically inhibit ERK-activity in BRAFV600E-mutant melanoma cells. The model elucidates molecular mechanisms of vertical inhibition of the BRAFV600E-MEK-ERK cascade and delineates how elevated BRAF concentrations generate drug resistance to dabrafenib and trametinib. The computational simulations further suggest that elevated ATP levels could be a factor in drug resistance to dabrafenib.\n\nConclusionsThe model can be used to systematically motivate which dabrafenib-trametinib dose-combinations, for treating BRAFV600E-mutated melanoma, warrant experimental investigation.",

    "abstract": "Despite an ever-increasing interest in reactive oxygen species (ROS) signalling during plant-microbe interactions, very little information exists, mainly for technical reasons, on the molecular mechanisms regulating intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) signalling during PAMP-triggered immunity. Here, we used a sensitive fluorimetry method and the H2O2 sensor roGFP2-Orp1, which revealed unsuspected features on the regulation of cytoplasmic H2O2 and thiol redox dynamics upon pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) perception by Arabidopsis thaliana. Extended PAMP-induced cytosolic roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation was distinct from the transient oxidative burst in the apoplast measured by luminol oxidation. Pharmacological and genetic analyses indicate that the prolonged PAMP-induced H2O2 increase in the cytoplasm was largely independent on NADPH oxidases and apoplastic peroxidases. By contrast, the NADPH oxidase mutant rbohF was hyper-sensitive to roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation by H2O2 and PAMP indicating a lower antioxidant capacity. Unlike previous reports, the rbohF mutant, but not rbohD, was impaired in PAMP-triggered stomatal closure and ROS production measured by a fluorescein-based probe in guard cells resulting in defects in stomatal defences against bacteria. However, stomatal closure was not correlated with an increase in roGFP2-Orp1 oxidation in guard cells. Interestingly, RBOHF also participated in PAMP-induced apoplastic alkalinisation. Altogether, our results provide novel insights on the interplay between apoplastic and cytosolic ROS dynamics and highlight the importance of RBOHF in plant immunity.\n\nSignificance statementPlants mount defence responses to pathogens by detecting pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). One response is a rapid and transient burst of reactive oxygen species (ROS, e.g. superoxide and hydrogen peroxide) in the cell wall (apoplast) produced by NADPH oxidases and cell wall peroxidases. Using a genetically-encoded hydrogen peroxide sensor roGFP2-Orp1, we found that, in contrast to the transient apoplastic ROS burst, there is also prolonged hydrogen peroxide production in the cytosol upon PAMP perception which is independent of NADPH oxidase and cell wall peroxidases. Our results suggest that apoplastic ROS rather than intracellular hydrogen peroxide is a signal triggering stomatal closure during PAMP-triggered immunity. Additionally, we re-address the relative contribution of the NADPH oxidases D and F in stomatal immunity.",

    "abstract": "Epitranscriptomic modifications constitute a gene expression checkpoint in all living organisms. As nitrogen is an essential element for plant growth and development, a reasonable hypothesis is that changes in the epitranscriptome may regulate nitrogen acquisition and metabolism. In this study, epitranscriptomic modifications caused by ammonium nutrition were monitored in maritime pine roots through direct RNA sequencing using Oxford Nanopore Technology. Transcriptomic responses mainly affected transcripts involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism, defense, hormone synthesis/signaling, and translation. Global detection of epitranscriptomic marks was performed to evaluate this posttranscriptional mechanism in untreated and ammonium-treated seedlings. Increased m6A deposition in the 3-UTR was observed in response to ammonium, which seems to be correlated with poly(A) lengths and changes in the relative abundance of the corresponding proteins. The results showed that m6A deposition and its dynamics seem to be important regulators of translation under ammonium nutrition. These findings suggest that protein translation is finely regulated through epitranscriptomic marks likely by changes in mRNA poly(A) length, transcript abundance and ribosome protein composition. An integration of multiomics data suggests that the epitranscriptome modulates responses to developmental and environmental changes, including ammonium nutrition, through buffering, filtering, and focusing the final products of gene expression.",

    "abstract": "A common cellular task is to match gene expression dynamically to a range of concentrations of a regulatory molecule. Studying glucose transport in budding yeast, we determine mechanistically how such matching occurs for seven hexose transporters. By combining time-lapse microscopy with mathematical modelling, we find that levels of transporters are history-dependent and are regulated by a push-pull system comprising two types of repressors. Repression by these two types varies with glucose in opposite ways, and not only matches the expression of transporters by their affinity to a range of glucose concentrations, but also the expression of some to how glucose is changing. We argue that matching is favoured by a rate-affinity trade-off and that the regulatory system allows yeast to import glucose rapidly enough to starve competitors. Matching expression to a pattern of input is fundamental, and we believe that push-pull repression is widespread.",

    "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major public health problem. Caused by external mechanical forces, a major characteristic of TBI is the shearing of axons across the white matter, which causes structural connectivity disruptions between brain regions. This diffuse injury leads to cognitive deficits, frequently requiring rehabilitation. Heterogeneity is another characteristic of TBI as severity and cognitive sequelae of the disease have a wide variation across patients, posing a big challenge for treatment. Thus, measures assessing network-wide structural connectivity disruptions in TBI are necessary to quantify injury burden of individuals, which would help in achieving personalized treatment, patient monitoring, and rehabilitation planning. Despite TBI being a disconnectivity syndrome, connectomic assessment of structural disconnectivity has been very scarce. In this study, we propose a novel connectomic measure that we call network anomaly score (NAS) to capture the integrity of structural connectivity in TBI patients by leveraging two major characteristics of the disease: diffuseness of axonal injury and heterogeneity of the disease. Over a longitudinal cohort of moderate-to-severe TBI patients, we demonstrate that structural network topology of patients are more heterogeneous and are significantly different than that of healthy controls at 3 months post-injury, where dissimilarity further increases up to 12 months. We also show that NAS captures injury burden as quantified by post-traumatic amnesia and that alterations in the structural brain network is not related to cognitive recovery. Finally we compare NAS to major graph theory measures used in TBI literature and demonstrate the superiority of NAS in characterizing the disease.",

    "abstract": "Taste buds contain 3 types of morphologically identifiable mature cells, 2 of which mediate transduction of specific taste qualities: Type III cells transduce sour while Type II cells transduce either sweet, bitter or umami. A long-standing controversy is whether the nerve fibers innervating these cells are wired specifically, in a labeled-line fashion, or non-specifically, leading to broad responsiveness across taste qualities, the so-called across-fiber system of encoding. Using serial blockface scanning electron microscopy through 5 circumvallate mouse taste buds, we reconstructed the patterns of connectivity of nerve fibers as well as the degree of potential interaction between the two types of taste transducing cells. Type II and Type III cells share few points of contact with one another, and display no morphologically identifiable synapses, suggesting limited direct interaction between these cell types. Of the 127 nerve fibers that make synaptic contacts with taste cells in the sampling volume, about 70% (n=91) synapse with only one taste cell. Of the remaining 36 fibers, 4 synapse with both Type II and Type III cells, the remainder synapsing exclusively with multiple Type II taste cells or multiple Type III cells. Since Type II and Type III cells transduce different taste qualities, the few mixed fibers do not follow a labeled-line organization according to taste quality information and show that connectional specificity in taste buds is not absolute.\n\nSignificance StatementTaste buds, the sensory end organs for the sense of taste, contain multiple types of sensory cells, with each responding to one of the primary tastes: salt, sweet, sour, bitter and umami. A long-standing question is whether each type of taste cell is wired specifically to a unique set of nerve fibers conveying a \"labeled-line\" message to the brain. Using serial sections, we determined the neural connectivity in mouse circumvallate taste buds. The majority of individual nerve fibers connect to a single type of taste cell, but 3.1% of the fibers branch to receive input from taste cells known to have different specificities. Thus taste cannot entirely be carried along nerve fibers dedicated to single taste qualities.",

In particular, prolonged LC hyperactivity often underlies stress disorders, whereas chronically reduced function often underlies symptoms of depression. Owing to its location deep in the brainstem, LC is difficult to access which limits translational approaches that involve manipulating these neurons. Here, we circumvent this problem by utilizing the retina as a chemogenetic target for commandeering a multsynaptic circuit to LC. We show that activation of this pathway can prevent depression-like behavior and associated pathology of the LC-noradrenergic (NA) system caused by light deprivation. Additionally, we show that melanopsin-containing intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) are the likely cell type responsible for initiating activity in this pathway. By capitalizing on this ocular route of designer receptor delivery, we demonstrate a novel, minimally-invasive method for manipulating this deep-brain circuit that is relevant to a wide array of neuropsychiatric disorders.",

    "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are prevalent psychiatric conditions characterized by exaggerated anxious arousal and threat reactivity. Animal and human studies suggest an anxiolytic potential of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT), yet, while a clinical application will require chronic administration protocols previous studies in humans have exclusively focused on single-dose (acute) intranasal OT effects. We aimed at determining whether the anxiolytic effects of OT are maintained with repeated (chronic) administration or are influenced by dose frequency and trait anxiety. A double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled pharmaco-fMRI trial (n=147) determined acute (single-dose) as well as chronic effects of two different dose frequencies of OT (OT administered daily for 5 days or every other day) on emotional reactivity in healthy subjects with high versus low trait anxiety. OT produced valence, dose frequency and trait anxiety specific effects, such that the low-frequency (intermittand) chronic dosage specifically attenuated neural reactivity in amygdala-insula-prefrontal regions in high anxious subjects in response to threatening but not positive stimuli. The present trial provides evidence that low dose frequency chronic oxytocin nasal spray has the potential to alleviate exaggerated neural threat reactivity in subjects with elevated anxiety levels underscoring a treatment potential for anxiety disorders.",

We have based this on data obtained from animals behaving freely. We have considered the modes of neuronal discharges and the occurrence of local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the theta and non-theta states at different inputs from the CA3 field, the medial entorhinal cortex, and the medial septum. In our work, we tried to reproduce the main experimental phenomena about rhythms in the CA1 field: the coupling of neurons to the phase of rhythms, cross-rhythm phase-phase and phase-amplitude coupling. Using computational experiments, we have proved the hypothesis that the descending phase of the theta rhythm in the CA1 field is formed by the input from the CA3 field via the Shaffer collaterals, and the ascending phase of the theta rhythm is formed by the inhibitory postsynaptic potentials from CCK basket cells. The slow gamma rhythm is coupled to the descending phase of the theta rhythm, since it also depends on the arrival of the signal via the Shaffer collaterals. The middle gamma rhythm is formed by the excitatory postsynaptic potentials of the principal neurons of the third layer of the entorhinal cortex, corresponds to experimental data. We were able to unite in a single mathematical model several theoretical ideas about the mechanisms of rhythmic processes in the CA1 field of the hippocampus.",

Sex drive shows substantial variation across humans, and it is possible that individual differences in MOR availability underlie interindividual of variation in human sex drive. Here we measured healthy male subjects (n=52) brains MOR availability with positron emission tomography (PET) using an agonist radioligand, [11C]carfentanil, that has high affinity for MORs. Sex drive was measured using self-reports of engaging in sexual behaviour (sex with partner and masturbating). Bayesian hierarchical regression analysis revealed that sex drive was positively associated with MOR availability in cortical and subcortical areas, notably in caudate nucleus, hippocampus, and cingulate cortices. These results were replicated in full-volume GLM analysis. These widespread effects are in line with high spatial autocorrelation in MOR expression in human brain. Complementary voxel-based morphometry analysis (n=108) provided limited evidence for association between sex drive and cortical density in the midcingulate cortex. We conclude that endogenous MOR tone is associated with individual differences in sex drive in human males.",

    "abstract": "Inter-brain synchronization is enhanced when individuals perform rhythmic interpersonal coordination tasks, such as playing instruments in music ensembles. Experimentally, synchronization has been shown to correlate with the performance of joint tapping tasks. However, it is unclear whether inter-brain synchronization is related to the stability of interpersonal coordination represented as the standard deviation of relative phase (SDRP). In this study, we simultaneously recorded electroencephalograms of two paired individuals during anti-phase tapping in three speed conditions: slow (reference inter-tap interval [ITI]: 0.5 s), fast (reference ITI: 0.25 s), and free (preferred ITI). We calculated the inter-brain synchronization within six regions of interest: frontal, central, left/right temporal, parietal, and occipital regions. We found that synchronization of the central-temporal regions was positively correlated with SDRP in the theta and alpha bands, while synchronization of the frontal-frontal and frontal-central was positively correlated with SDRP in the beta band. These results demonstrate that inter-brain synchronization occurs only when task requirements are high, and that it increases with the instability of the coordination. This may be explained by the stronger mutual prediction required in unstable coordination than that in stable coordination, which increases inter-brain synchronization.",

    "abstract": "Working memory (WM), the capacity to briefly and intentionally maintain mental items, is key to successful goal-directed behaviour and impaired in a range of psychiatric disorders. To date, several brain regions, connections, and types of neural activity have been correlatively associated with WM performance. However, no unifying framework to integrate these findings exits, as the degree of their species- and task-specificity remains unclear. Here, we investigate WM correlates in three task paradigms each in mice and humans, with simultaneous multi-site electrophysiological recordings. We developed a machine learning-based approach to decode WM-mediated choices in individual trials across subjects from hundreds of electrophysiological measures of neural connectivity with up to 90% prediction accuracy. Relying on predictive power as indicator of correlates of psychological functions, we unveiled a large number of task phase-specific WM-related connectivity from analysis of predictor weights in an unbiased manner. Only a few common connectivity patterns emerged across tasks. In rodents, these were thalamus-prefrontal cortex delta- and beta-frequency connectivity during memory encoding and maintenance, respectively, and hippocampal-prefrontal delta- and theta-range coupling during retrieval, in rodents. In humans, task-independent WM correlates were exclusively in the gamma-band. Mostly, however, the predictive activity patterns were unexpectedly specific to each task and always widely distributed across brain regions. Our results suggest that individual tasks cannot be used to uncover generic physiological correlates of the psychological construct termed WM and call for a new conceptualization of this cognitive domain in translational psychiatry.",

    "abstract": "Joint structural-functional (S-F) developmental studies present a novel approach to address the complex neuroscience questions on how the human brain works and how it matures. Joint S-F biomarkers have the inherent potential to model effectively the brains maturation, fill the information gap in temporal brain atlases, and demonstrate how the brains performance matures during the lifespan. This review presents the current state of knowledge on heterochronous and heterogeneous development of S-F links during the maturation period. The S-F relationship has been investigated in early-matured unimodal and prolonged-matured transmodal regions of the brain using a variety of structural and functional biomarkers and data acquisition modalities. Joint S-F unimodal studies have employed auditory and visual stimuli, while the main focus of joint S-F transmodal studies has been resting-state networks and working memory. However, non-significant associations between some structural and functional biomarkers and their maturation show that designing and developing effective S-F biomarkers is still a challenge in the field. Maturational characteristics of brain asymmetries have been poorly investigated by the joint S-F studies, and the results were inconsistent with previous non-joint ones. The inherent complexity of the brain performance can be modeled using multifactorial and nonlinear techniques as promising methods to simulate the impact of age on S-F relations considering their analysis challenges.",

    "abstract": "T cells need to adapt their cellular metabolism for effector cell differentiation. This relies on alterations in mitochondrial physiology. Which signals and molecules regulate those alterations remains unclear. We recently reported, that the mitochondrial protein TCAIM inhibits activation-induced changes in mitochondrial morphology and function and thus, CD4+ effector T cell formation. Using conditional TCAIM knock-in (KI) and knockout (KO) mice, we now show that it also applies to CD8+ T cells and more importantly, delineate the molecular processes in mitochondria by which TCAIM controls effector cell differentiation. TCAIM KI resulted in reduced activation-induced HIF1 protein expression. Metabolomics and transcriptional data in combination with mathematical flux modeling revealed an impaired induction of anabolic pathways, especially of the mevalonate pathway and cholesterol biosynthesis in TCAIM KI CD8+ T cells. Addition of cholesterol completely rescued HIF1 protein expression, activation and proliferation of TCAIM KI CD8+ T cells. At the molecular level, TCAIM delayed activation-induced mitochondria-ER contact (MERC) formation by binding to MERC promoting proteins such as RMD3 and VDAC2. In summary, we demonstrate that TCAIM suppresses effector cell differentiation by inhibiting MERC formation, which induce HIF1-mediated increase in cellular metabolism and cholesterol biosynthesis.",

    "abstract": "Pigments are among the oldest nanoparticulate products known to mankind, and their use in tattoos is also very old. Nowadays, 25% of American people aged 18 to 50 are tattooed, which poses the question of the delayed effects of tattoos. In this article, we investigated three cobalt (Pigment Violet 14 (purple color)) or cobalt alloy pigments (Pigment Blue 28 (blue color), Pigment Green 14 (green color)), and one zinc pigment (Pigment White 4 (white color)) which constitute a wide range of colors found in tattoos. These pigments contain microparticles and a significant proportion of submicroparticles or nanoparticles (in either aggregate or free form). Because of the key role of macrophages in the scavenging of particulate materials, we tested the effects of cobalt- and zinc-based pigments on the J774A.1 macrophage cell line. In order to detect delayed effects, we compared two exposure schemes: acute exposure for 24 hours and an exposure for 24 hours followed by a 3-day post-exposure recovery period. The conjunction of these two schemes allowed for the investigation of the delayed or sustained effects of pigments. All pigments induced functional effects on macrophages, most of which were pigment-dependent. For example, Pigment Green 19, Pigment Blue 28, and Pigment White 4 showed a delayed alteration of the phagocytic capacity of cells. Moreover, all the pigments tested induced a slight but significant increase in tumor necrosis factor secretion. This effect, however, was transitory. Conversely, only Pigment Blue 28 induced both a short and sustained increase in interleukin 6 secretion. Results showed that in response to bacterial stimuli (LPS), the secretion of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 6 declined after exposure to pigments followed by a recovery period. For chemoattractant cytokines (MCP-1 or MIP-1), delayed effects were observed with a secretion decreased in presence of Pigment Blue 28 and Pigment violet 14, both with or without LPS stimuli. The pigments also induced persisting changes in some important macrophage membrane markers such as CD11b, an integrin contributing to cell adhesion and immunological tolerance. In conclusion, the pigments induced functional disorders in macrophages, which, in some cases, persist long after exposure, even at non-toxic doses.\n\nContribution to the field statementUnlike dyes, which are water-soluble, pigments are water-insoluble and thus viewed as inert coloring substances. However, historical pigments such as lead white or vermilion (mercuric sulfide) have been shown to be toxic, suggesting that pigments inertness may not be complete under biological conditions.\n\nPigments being particulate (nano) materials, they are taken up by professional scavenger cells such as macrophages once they have penetrated into the body. One epitome of this situation is represented by tattooing: the pigments injected with the ink are taken up by dermal macrophages, which life cycle ensures the localized persistence of tattoos over time.\n\nUsing an in vitro macrophage culture system adapted to study delayed effects, we have investigated the effects of a series of cobalt- and zinc-containing pigments on macrophages.\n\nFirst of all, the toxicity of the pigments correlated well with their solubility in acidic media, i.e. conditions prevailing in the phagolysosomes. Even when used at non-toxic doses, the cobalt and zinc pigments showed immediate and/or delayed effects on macrophage functions such as phagocytosis, adhesion, tissue repair or response to bacterial stimuli. Overall, these results show that some pigments may not be as inert as previously thought, and describe a system to investigate these effects.",

    "abstract": "Since multiple ribosomes can engage a single mRNA, nonuniform ribosome progression can result in collisions. Ribosome collisions during translation elongation elicit a multifaceted ribosome-associated quality control (RQC) response. Despite advanced mechanistic understanding of translation initiation, a parallel RQC pathway that acts on collided preinitiation complexes has not been described. Here, we show that blocking progression of scanning or elongating ribosomes past the start codon triggers uS3 and uS5 ribosomal ubiquitylation. We demonstrate that conditions that activate the integrated stress response can also induce preinitiation complex collisions. The ubiquitin ligase, RNF10, and the deubiquitylating enzyme, USP10, are the key regulators of uS3 and uS5 ubiquitylation. Prolonged uS3 and uS5 ubiquitylation results in 40S, but not 60S, ribosomal protein degradation in an autophagy-independent manner. This study identifies a distinct arm in the RQC pathway, initiation RQC (iRQC), that acts on pervasive ribosome collisions during translation initiation to modulate translation activity and capacity.",

    "abstract": "Over the last decade, single-particle electron cryo-microscopy has become one of the main techniques contributing to the growing library of high-resolution structures of macromolecules and their assemblies. For a full understanding of molecular mechanisms, however, it is important to place them into the broader context of a cell. Traditionally, this context can be visualized in 3D by electron cryo-tomography, and more recently, has also been studied by template matching of 2D images of cells and viruses. A current limitation of the latter approach is the high computational cost that limits the throughput and widespread adoption of this method. We describe here a GPU-accelerated implementation of 2D template matching in the image processing software cisTEM that allows for easy scaling and improves the accessibility of this approach. We apply 2D template matching to identify ribosomes in images of frozen-hydrated Mycoplasma pneumoniae cells and demonstrate that it can function as a versatile tool for in situ visual proteomics and in situ structure determination. We compare the results with 3D template matching of tomograms acquired on identical sample locations. We identify strengths and weaknesses of both techniques which offer complementary information about target localization and identity.",

    "abstract": "During embryonic development, cellular forces synchronize in space and time to generate functional tissue shapes. Apical constriction is one of these force-generating processes, and it is necessary to modulate epithelial curvature in fundamental morphogenetic events, such as neural tube folding. The emerging field of synthetic developmental biology proposes bottom-up approaches to examine the contribution of each cellular process to complex morphogenesis. However, the shortage of tools to manipulate three-dimensional (3D) shapes of mammalian tissues currently hinders the progress of the field. Here we report the development of \"OptoShroom3\", a new optogenetic tool that achieves fast spatiotemporal control of apical constriction in mammalian epithelia. Activation of OptoShroom3 through illumination of individual cells in an epithelial cell sheet reduced their apical surface while illumination of groups of cells caused deformation in the adjacent regions. By using OptoShroom3, we further manipulated 3D tissue shapes. Light-induced apical constriction provoked the folding of epithelial cell colonies on soft gels. Its application to murine and human neural organoids led to thickening of neuroepithelia, apical lumen reduction in optic vesicles, and flattening in neuroectodermal tissues. These results show that spatiotemporal control of apical constriction can trigger several types of 3D deformation depending on the initial tissue context.",

Researchers use IPMs to investigate questions ranging from linking drivers to plant population dynamics, planning conservation and management strategies, and quantifying selective pressures in natural populations. The popularity of stage-structured population models has been supported by R scripts and packages (e.g. IPMpack, popbio, popdemo, lefko3) aimed at ecologists, which have introduced a broad repertoire of functionality and outputs. However, pressing ecological, evolutionary, and conservation biology topics require developing more complex IPMs, and considerably more expertise to implement them.

    "abstract": "Conserving nomadic species is challenging due to the difficulty in monitoring their characteristically transient populations, and thereby detecting range-wide declines. An example is the Yellow-tailed Black-Cockatoo (YTBC; Zanda funerea), which disperses widely in search of food and is regularly--but sporadically--observed across eastern Australia. Under climate warming, a general southward shift in species distributions is expected in the southern hemisphere, with the extreme southern margins being truncated by an ocean barrier. Given these constraints, we ask whether sufficient refugia will exist for the YTBC in the future, by: (i) modelling habitat relationships within current geographic range of the YTBC based on weather, climate, vegetation, and land use, and (ii) using this framework, coupled with climate-model projections, to forecast 21st century impacts. Intensive land use and high variability in temperature and rainfall seem to most limit YTBC occurrence. In contrast, areas with a cooler, stable climate, and a network of old-growth forests, such as occurs in parts of south-eastern Australia and Tasmania, are most suitable for the species. As Australia becomes progressively hotter under climate change, the preferred bioclimatic envelope of the YTBC is forecast to contract poleward (as a general pattern) and to fragment within the existing range. However, despite an extensive loss of climatically suitable regions, the YTBC might find stable refugia at the southern margins of its geographic range, although continued loss of old-growth forests undermines their nesting potential. Therefore, beyond habitat conservation, creating nesting opportunities within plantation forests would likely be an effective conservation strategy to preserve habitat quality in climate refugia.",

    "abstract": "Canine Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic multifactorial disease, resulting from complex interactions between the intestinal immune system, microbiota and environmental factors in genetically predisposed dogs. Previously, we identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and regions on chromosomes (Chr) 7, 9, 11 and 13 associated with IBD in German shepherd dogs (GSD) using GWAS and FST association analyses. Here, building on our previous results, we performed a targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a two Mb region on Chr 9 and 11 that included 14 of the newly identified candidate genes, in order to identify potential functional SNPs that could explain these association signals. Furthermore, correlations between genotype and treatment response were estimated. Results revealed several SNPs in the genes for canine EEF1A1, MDH2, IL3, IL4, IL13 and PDLIM, which, based on the known function of their corresponding proteins, further our insight into the pathogenesis of IBD in dogs. In addition, several pathways involved in innate and adaptive immunity and inflammatory responses (i.e. T helper cell differentiation, Th1 and Th2 activation pathway, communication between innate and adaptive immune cells and differential regulation of cytokine production in intestinal epithelial cells by IL-17A and IL-17F), were constructed involving the gene products in the candidate regions for IBD susceptibility. Interestingly, some of the identified SNPs were present in only one outcome group, suggesting that different genetic factors are involved in the pathogenesis of IBD in different treatment response groups. This also highlights potential genetic markers to predict the response in dogs treated for IBD.",

This dual mechanism hypothesis predicts different hybrid DNA patterns in noncrossover and crossover recombinants. We show that these predictions are not upheld, by mapping with unprecedented resolution, parental strand contributions to recombinants at a model locus. Instead, break repair in both noncrossovers and crossovers involves synthesis-dependent strand annealing, often with multiple rounds of strand invasion. Crossover-specific double Holliday junction formation occurs via processes that involve branch migration as an integral feature and that can be separated from break repair itself. These findings reveal meiotic recombination to be a highly dynamic process and prompt a new view of the relationship between crossover and noncrossover recombination.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the determinants of genomic base composition is fundamental to understanding genome evolution. GC biased gene conversion (gBGC) is a key driving force behind genomic GC content, through the preferential incorporation of GC alleles over AT alleles during recombination, driving them towards fixation. The majority of work on gBGC has focussed on its role in coding regions, largely to address how it confounds estimates of selection. Non-coding regions have received less attention, particularly in regard to the interaction of gBGC and the effective population size (Ne) within and between species. To address this, we investigate how the strength of gBGC (B = 4Neb, where b is the conversion bias) varies within the non-coding genome of two wild passerines. We use a dataset of published high coverage genomes (10 great tits and 10 zebra finches) to estimate B, nucleotide diversity, changes in Ne, and crossover rates from linkage maps, in 1Mb homologous windows in each species. We demonstrate remarkable conservation of both B and crossover rate between species. We show that the mean strength of gBGC in the zebra finch is more than double that in the great tit, consistent with its twofold greater effective population size. B also correlates with both crossover rate and nucleotide diversity in each species. Finally, we estimate equilibrium GC content from both divergence and polymorphism data, which indicates that B has been increasing in both species, and provide support for population expansion explaining a large proportion of this increase in the zebra finch.\n\nSignificance statementUnderstanding the forces that change the nucleotide base composition of genomes is central to understanding their evolution. One such force is GC biased gene conversion, a process that during recombination converts some heterozygous base positions to homozygous. This process is more likely to convert adenine and thymine bases to guanine and cytosine bases than the other way around, hence is GC biased. This increases the frequency of GC alleles in a way similar to positive selection. This process has largely been studied within protein coding regions, and not often compared between species. We measure its strength in the non-coding areas of the genomes of two bird species, showing it to be stronger in the species with the larger population size.",

    "abstract": "The dimeric dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) metalloenzyme, an adjunct anti-cancer drug target contains highly specialized 4 x Fe2+4S2-4 clusters per chain. These clusters facilitate the catalysis of the rate-limiting step in the pyrimidine degradation pathway through a harmonized electron transfer cascade that triggers a redox catabolic reaction. In the process, majority of administered 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) cancer drug is inactivated while a small proportion is activated to nucleic acid antimetabolites. The occurrence of missense mutations in DPD protein within the general population, including those of African descent, has adverse toxicity effects due to altered 5-FU metabolism. Thus, deciphering mutation effects on protein structure and function is vital, especially for precision medicine purposes. We previously proposed combined molecular dynamics (MD) and dynamic residue network (DRN) analysis to decipher the molecular mechanisms of missense mutations in other proteins. However, the presence of Fe2+4S2-4 clusters in DPD poses a challenge for such in silico studies. The existing AMBER force field parameters cannot accurately describe the Fe2+ center coordination exhibited by this enzyme. Therefore, this study aimed to derive AMBER force field parameters for DPD enzyme Fe2+ centers, using the original Seminario method and collation features Visual Force Field Derivation Toolkit as a supportive approach. All-atom MD simulations were performed to validate the results. Both approaches generated similar force field parameters which accurately described the human DPD protein Fe2+4S2-4 clusters architecture. This information is crucial and opens new avenues for in silico cancer pharmacogenomics and drug discovery related research on 5-FU drug efficacy and toxicity issues.",

    "abstract": "Microbial communities often respond to environmental cues by adopting collective behaviors--like biofilms or swarming--that benefit the population. Bioconvection is a distinct and robust collective behavior wherein microbes locally gather into dense groups and subsequently plume downward through fluid environments, driving flow and mixing on scales thousands of times larger than an individual cell. Though bioconvection was observed more than 100 years ago, effects of differing physical and chemical inputs, as well as its potential selective advantages to different species of microbes, remain largely unexplored. In the canonical microbial bioconvector Bacillus subtilis, density inversions that drive this flow are setup by vertically oriented oxygen gradients that originate from an air-liquid interface. In this work, we develop Escherichia coli as a complementary model organism for the study of bioconvection. We show that for E. coli and B. subtilis, bioconvection confers a context-dependent growth benefit with clear genetic correlates to motility and chemotaxis. We found that fluid depth, cell concentration, and carbon availability have complimentary effects on the emergence and timing of bioconvective patterns, and whereas oxygen gradients are required for B. subtilis bioconvection, we found that E. coli deficient in aerotaxis ({Delta}aer) or energy-taxis ({Delta}tsr) still bioconvect, as do cultures that lack an air-liquid interface. Thus, in two distantly related microbes, bioconvection confers context-dependent growth benefits, and E. coli bioconvection is robustly elicited by multiple types of chemotaxis. These results greatly expand the set of physical and metabolic conditions in which this striking collective behavior can be expected and demonstrate its potential to be a generic force for behavioral selection across ecological contexts.",

    "abstract": "Acral melanoma, the most common melanoma subtype among non-Caucasian individuals, is associated with poor prognosis. However, its key molecular drivers remain obscure. Here, we performed integrative genomic and clinical profiling of acral melanomas from a cohort of 104 patients treated in North America or China. We found that recurrent, late-arising amplifications of cytoband chr22q11.21 are a leading determinant of inferior survival, strongly associated with metastasis, and linked to downregulation of immunomodulatory genes associated with response to immune checkpoint blockade. Unexpectedly, LZTR1 - a known tumor suppressor in other cancers - is a key candidate oncogene in this cytoband. Silencing of LZTR1 in melanoma cell lines caused apoptotic cell death independent of major hotspot mutations or melanoma subtypes. Conversely, overexpression of LZTR1 in normal human melanocytes initiated processes associated with metastasis, including anchorage-independent growth, formation of spheroids, and increased levels of MAPK and SRC activities. Our results provide new insights into the etiology of acral melanoma and implicate LZTR1 as a key tumor promoter and therapeutic target.",

Here, we show that SPOP mutations, an early event in prostate tumorigenesis, reshape the chromatin landscape and AR-directed transcriptional program in normal prostate cells. Induction of SPOP mutation results in DNA accessibility and AR binding patterns found in human PCa. Consistent with dependency on this AR reprogramming, castration of SPOP mutant mouse models results in the loss of neoplastic phenotypes. Finally, human SPOP mutant PCa show improved response to AR-targeted therapies. Together, these results show that a single genomic alteration may be sufficient to reprogram the chromatin of normal prostate cells toward oncogenic phenotypes and that SPOP mutant tumors may be preferentially dependent on AR signaling through this mechanism.",

    "abstract": "Language transformers, like GPT-2, have demonstrated remarkable abilities to process text, and now constitute the backbone of deep translation, summarization and dialogue algorithms. However, whether these models encode information that relates to human comprehension remains controversial. Here, we show that the representations of GPT-2 not only map onto the brain responses to spoken stories, but also predict the extent to which subjects understand narratives. To this end, we analyze 101 subjects recorded with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging while listening to 70 min of short stories. We then fit a linear model to predict brain activity from GPT-2s activations, and correlate this mapping with subjects comprehension scores as assessed for each story. The results show that GPT-2s brain predictions significantly correlate with semantic comprehension. These effects are bilaterally distributed in the language network and peak with a correlation of R=0.50 in the angular gyrus. Overall, this study paves the way to model narrative comprehension in the brain through the lens of modern language algorithms.",

    "abstract": "Project AbstractMaking sense of our environment requires us to extract simultaneous temporal and spatial information from multiple sensory modalities, particularly audition and vision. This sensory information can be stored in working memory (WM) to guide future actions, at which point it must be safeguarded against interference from ongoing sensory processing. Recent fMRI research has uncovered regions in human frontal cortex well-suited to coordinate this interplay between attention and WM for multisensory and multidimensional information. Which of these brain regions are engaged depends on both the sensory modality of the input and the information domain of the task, forming the basis of two complementary networks specialized for auditory/temporal and visual/spatial processing. Motivated by the functional specializations of these networks, we examined whether similarity in sensory modality and information domain modulates neural and perceptual interference between two concurrent tasks. Participants stored temporal or spatial information about auditory or visual stimuli in WM, and on some trials, performed an intervening temporal or spatial auditory task during WM retention. WM recall and auditory perceptual judgments were impaired when the two tasks relied on the same sensory modality and/or information domain. Pupil dilations were also larger in these conditions, indicating increased cognitive effort. Event-related potentials (ERPs) revealed a neural signature of domain-based interference that was masked by behavioral ceiling effects. These results demonstrate that modality and information domain jointly affect how task information is represented in WM, and concomitantly, how tasks engage the complementary auditory-temporal and visual/spatial cognitive control networks.",

    "abstract": "Sensory and corticospinal (CST) pathways activate spinal GABAergic interneurons with axo-axonic connections onto proprioceptive (Ia) afferents that depolarize these afferents (termed primary afferent depolarization, PAD). In rodents sensory-evoked PAD is produced by GABAA receptors at nodes of Ranvier in Ia-afferents, rather than at presynaptic terminals, and facilitates action potential propagation to motoneurons by preventing branch point failures, rather than causing presynaptic inhibition. Here we examined if PAD likewise facilitates the Ia-afferent mediated H-reflex in humans by evoking PAD with both sensory and CST stimulation. H-reflexes in several lower limb muscles were facilitated by prior conditioning from low-threshold proprioceptive, cutaneous or CST pathways, with a similar time course ([~]200 ms) to the PAD measured in rodent Ia-afferents. Long trains of repeated cutaneous or proprioceptive afferent stimulation produced long-lasting facilitation of the H-reflex for up to 2 minutes, consistent with the tonic depolarization of rodent Ia-afferents mediated by nodal 5-GABA receptors for similar stimulation trains. Facilitation of the conditioned H-reflexes was not mediated by direct facilitation of the motoneurons because isolated stimulation of sensory or CST pathways did not modulate the firing rate of tonically activated motor units in tested muscles. Furthermore, cutaneous conditioning increased the firing probability of a single motor unit during the H-reflex without increasing its firing rate at this time, indicating that the underlying excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) was more probable, but not larger. These results are consistent with sensory and CST pathways activating nodal GABAA receptors that reduce intermittent failure of action potentials propagating into Ia-afferent branches.\n\nKey Points SummaryO_LIThe control of posture and movement requires peripheral sensory feedback, which was previously thought to be inhibited by specialized GABAergic neurons in the spinal cord.\nC_LIO_LIBased on new findings in rodents, we provide evidence in humans that sensory and corticospinal pathways that likely activate these GABAergic pathways facilitate, rather than inhibit, the flow of sensory feedback in afferents that carry information about body position, movement and effort.\nC_LIO_LIThese new findings of how sensory and descending pathways facilitate this sensory feedback to spinal motor neurons can now be applied to people with injury to the brain or spinal cord where these GABA neurons are affected, allowing us to understand how altered sensory control may affect residual motor function and the production of involuntary muscle spasticity.\nC_LI",

Here, we studied the genome-wide distribution of new histones relative to parental DNA template strands and replication initiation zones using double-click-seq. In control conditions, new histones were preferentially found on DNA replicated by the lagging strand machinery. Strikingly, replication stress induced by hydroxyurea or curaxin treatment, and inhibition of ATR or p53 inactivation, inverted the observed histone deposition bias to the strand replicated by the leading strand polymerase in line with previously reported effects on RPA occupancy.

    "abstract": "BackgroundThe tick Ixodes ricinus is an important vector of tick-borne diseases including Lyme borreliosis. In continental Europe, the nymphal stage of I. ricinus often has a bimodal phenology with a large spring/early summer peak and a smaller fall peak. While there is consensus about the origin of the spring nymphal peak, there are two alternative hypotheses for the fall nymphal peak, direct development versus delayed diapause. These two hypotheses make different predictions about the time lags of the correlations between the spring peak, the fall peak, and seed production (masting) by deciduous trees.\n\nMethodsTo determine which hypothesis is most important for explaining the fall peak, we used data from a long-term surveillance study (15 years) on the density of I. ricinus nymphal ticks at 4 different elevation sites in an area of Switzerland that is endemic for Lyme borreliosis, and long-term data on the mast of the European beech tree from the literature.\n\nResultsI. ricinus nymphs had a bimodal phenology at the three lower elevation sites, but a unimodal phenology at the top elevation site. At the lower elevation sites, the density of nymphs (DON) in the fall was strongly correlated with the DON in the spring of the following year. The inter-annual variation in the densities of I. ricinus nymphs in the fall and spring were best explained by a 1-year versus a 2-year time lag with the beech tree masting index. Fall nymphs had higher fat content and are younger than spring nymphs. All of these observations are consistent with the direct development hypothesis for the fall peak of I. ricinus nymphs at our study site. Our study provides new insight into the complex bimodal phenology of this important disease vector.\n\nConclusionsPublic health officials in Europe should be aware that following a strong mast year, the DON will increase 1 year later in the fall and 2 years later in the spring and summer. Population ecology studies of I. ricinus should consider that the spring and fall peak in the same calendar year represent different generations of ticks.",

Highly contiguous genome assemblies have become available for a variety of species, but accurate and complete annotation of gene models, inclusive of alternative splice isoforms and transcription start and termination sites remains difficult with traditional approaches. Here, we utilized full-length isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq), a long-read RNA sequencing technology, to obtain a comprehensive annotation of the transcriptome of the ant Harpegnathos saltator. The improved genome annotations include additional splice isoforms and extended 3 untranslated regions for more than 4,000 genes. Reanalysis of RNA-seq experiments using these annotations revealed several genes with caste-specific differential expression and tissue-or caste-specific splicing patterns that were missed in previous analyses. The extended 3 untranslated regions afforded great improvements in the analysis of existing single-cell RNA-seq data, resulting in the recovery of the transcriptomes of 18% more cells. The deeper single-cell transcriptomes obtained with these new annotations allowed us to identify additional markers for several cell types in the ant brain, as well as genes differentially expressed across castes in specific cell types. Our results demonstrate that Iso-Seq is an efficient and effective approach to improve genome annotations and maximize the amount of information that can be obtained from existing and future genomic datasets in Harpegnathos and other organisms.",

    "abstract": "In this study, I describe a model in which mechanical linkages dynamically interact in a stepwise and reversible manner, and use it to model the chemical cycle and lever arm action of the biomolecular motor myosin. Myosin is emulated using a series of multivalent chemical reactions between a linkage enzyme and four reactants: a cleaveable fuel, two cleavage products, and ligand. Geometric coupling between the fuel and ligand binding sites--an analog for negative allosteric coupling--allows reaction sequences similar to nucleotide exchange to take place that in turn drive the \"strokes\" of the machines lever arm. Cyclic chemical behavior is demonstrated by stochastic simulation, and mechanical activity by a series of logical arguments. I show how a reciprocal and nonreciprocal conformational cycle emerge from the allosteric rules designed to achieve chemical cycling, and how the non-reciprocal cycle can break directional symmetry along a track like structure. A dimeric construct is used to demonstrate how directed motion can be designed by inhibition of the reciprocal cycle and reinforcement of the non-reciprocal cycle, through allosteric feedback between the units of the dimer. By showing how the chemomechanical cycle of a biomolecular motor can be recreated with simple geometric and chemical principles, this work may help advance the rational design of allosteric mechanisms, and the development of synthetic molecular motors.",

    "abstract": "MotivationStitching microscope images into a mosaic is an essential step in the analysis and visualization of large biological specimens, particularly human and animal tissues. Recent approaches to highly-multiplexed imaging generate high-plex data from sequential rounds of lower-plex imaging. These multiplexed imaging methods promise to yield precise molecular single-cell data and information on cellular neighborhoods and tissue architecture. However, attaining mosaic images with single-cell accuracy requires robust image stitching and image registration capabilities that are not met by existing methods.\n\nResultsWe describe the development and testing of ASHLAR, a Python tool for coordinated stitching and registration of 103 or more individual multiplexed images to generate accurate whole-slide mosaics. ASHLAR reads image formats from most commercial microscopes and slide scanners, and we show that it performs better than existing open source and commercial software. ASHLAR outputs standard OME-TIFF images that are ready for analysis by other open-source tools and recently developed image analysis pipelines.\n\nAvailability and implementationASHLAR is written in Python and available under an MIT license at https://github.com/labsyspharm/ashlar.

The trials of groups were idem. The postural swings, that is, the move of the center-of-pressure (COP), were recorded. Maple, a computer math system, has allowed us to apply the Principal Components Analysis, Statistical analysis, Kernel Density Estimations (KDE) for the probabilities. Poincare and Recurrence Plots were other tools for modern data mining. The non-Gauss features of the real distributions are not that to be neglect. They exist not only as outliers but as sharp kurtosis and skewness. Still, they are so far not enow to grave doubts to the Fractional Brownian model. We found some subtle aging hallmarks for focus-groups. First, the trend of variability descriptors to be bi-modal is sheerer for the older group. Second, the coefficients of correlations of the short-time variability index with other descriptors are clear age-related.\n\n2012 ACM Subject ClassificationApplied computing [-&gt;] Life and medical sciences [-&gt;] Health informatics",

    "abstract": "Recently we have identified that endothelial surface annexin A2 (ANAX2) functions as a receptor for spotted fever group rickettsial adhesin outer membrane protein B (OmpB), which binds to the endothelial cell (EC) surface. Moreover, we reported that intracellular cAMP receptor EPAC1 modulates ANXA2 tyrosine (Y) 23 phosphorylation, and inactivation of EPAC1 suppresses ANXA2 expression on the EC luminal surface by downregulating Y23 phosphorylation. Since we reported that EPAC1 plays a critical role in the initial step to successfully establish rickettsial infection of ECs, this work aims to answer the following: (a) What is the mechanism underlying the regulatory role of EPAC1 in ECs during the initial step of bacterial infection? (b) Is the EPAC1-ANXA2 signaling pathway involved in the regulation of rickettsial adhesion to ECs?\n\nIn the present study, an established system that is anatomically-based and quantifies bacterial adhesion to ECs in vivo was combined with novel fluidic force microscopy (FluidFM) to dissect the functional role of the EPAC1-ANXA2 signaling pathway in rickettsiae-EC adhesion. We reveal that the deletion of the EPAC1 gene impedes rickettsial binding to endothelium in vivo. In addition, single living brain microvascular EC study that employs FluidFM and site-directed mutagenesis provides evidence that supports our finding that EPAC1 governs rickettsial adhesion to EC surfaces via regulation of ANXA2 Y23 phosphorylation.",

Considering active storage of reserves, there is a trade-off between carbon allocation to growth and to reserves and defense. A resulting hypothesis is that allocation to reserves exhibits a coordinated variation with functional traits associated with the  fast-slow plant economics spectrum.\n\nMethodsWe tested the relationship between non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) of tree organs and functional traits using 61 angiosperm tree species from temperate and tropical forests with phylogenetic hierarchical Bayesian models.\n\nKey ResultsOur results provide evidence that NSC concentrations in woody organs and plant functional traits are largely decoupled, meaning that species resilience is unrelated to their position on the  fast-slow plant economics spectrum. In contrast, we found that variation between NSC concentrations in leaves and the fast-slow continuum was coordinated, as species with higher leaf NSC had traits values associated with resource conservative species such as lower SLA, lower Amax, and high wood density. We did not detect an influence of leaf habit on the variation of NSC concentrations in tree organs.\n\nConclusionsEfforts to predict the response of ecosystems to global change will need to integrate a suite of plant traits, such as NSC concentrations in woody organs, that are independent of the  fast-slow spectrum and that capture how species respond to a broad range of global change factors.",

    "abstract": "Developing novel methods for the analysis of intracellular signaling networks is essential for understanding interconnected biological processes that underlie complex human disorders. A fundamental goal of this research is to quantify the vulnerability of a signaling network to the dysfunction of one or multiple molecules, when the dysfunction is defined as an incorrect response to the input signals. In this study, we propose an efficient algorithm to identify the extreme signaling failures that can induce the most detrimental impact on the physiological function of a molecular network. The algorithm basically finds the molecules, or groups of molecules, with the maximum vulnerability, i.e., the highest probability of causing the network failure, when they are dysfunctional. We propose another algorithm that efficiently accounts for signaling feedbacks in this analysis. The algorithms are tested on two experimentally verified ERBB and T cell signaling networks. Surprisingly, results reveal that as the number of concurrently dysfunctional molecules increases, the maximum vulnerability values quickly reach to a plateau following an initial increase. This suggests the specificity of vulnerable molecule (s) involved, as a specific number of faulty molecules cause the most detrimental damage to the function of the network. Increasing a random number of simultaneously faulty molecules does not further deteriorate the function of the network. Such a group of specific molecules whose dysfunction causes the extreme signaling failures can better elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of complex trait disorders, and can offer new insights for the development of novel therapeutics.",

Previous studies showed that only ST11/CG258-cpKP successfully disseminated in China, however, the underlying genetic bases are still unknown. We conducted a comprehensive genomic-epidemiology analysis on 420 cpKP isolates from 70 hospitals in 24 Chinese provinces during 2009-2017 based on short-/long-reads sequencing. Three  golden combinations of host--blaKPC-carrying plasmids (Clade 3.1+3.2--IncFIIpHN7A8, Clade 3.1+3.2--IncFIIpHN7A8:IncR, Clade 3.3--IncFIIpHN7A8:IncpA1763-KPC) endowed cpKP with advantages both in genotypes (strong-correlation/co-evolution) and phenotypes (resistance/growth/competition), thereby facilitating nationwide spread of ST11/CG258-cpKP.

    "abstract": "We isolate a novel archaeal temperate virus named Aeropyrum globular virus 1 (AGV1) from the host Aeropyrum culture. Reproduction of AGV1 was induced by adding 20 mM tris-acetate buffer to exponentially growing host cells. Negatively stained virions showed spherical morphology (60 {+/-}2 nm in diameter) similar to Globuloviridae viruses. The double-stranded circular DNA genome of AGV1 contains 18,222 bp encoding 34 open-reading frames. No ORFs showed significant similarity with Globuloviridae viruses. AGV1 shares three genes, including an integrase gene, with reported spindle-shaped temperate viruses. However we couldnt detect its integration site in the host genome. Moreover AGV1 seemed not to replicate autonomously because there are no origin recognition boxes in the genome. qPCR results showed that the genome copy number of AGV1 was lower than that of the host genome (10-3 copies per host genome). Upon the addition of tris-acetate buffer, a steep increase in the AGV1 genome copy number (9.5-26 copies per host genome at 2 days post-treatment) was observed although clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) elements of the host genome showed significant matches with AGV1 protospacers. Our findings suggest that AGV1 is a novel globular virus exhibiting an unstable carrier state in the growing host and in that way AGV1 can escape from the host defense system and propagate under stressful host conditions.\n\nImportanceStudying archaeal viruses yields novel insights into the roles of virospheres and viruses in the evolutionary process of their hosts. Here, we isolated a novel spherical virus named Aeropyrum globular virus 1. AGV1 has integrase gene but its genome is not integrated into the host genome. AGV1 could not replicate autonomously due to the lack of origin recognition boxes and thus its copy number was too low (10-3 copies per host genome) without any inducing stimulus. However, upon the addition of tris-acetate buffer, the AGV1 genome copy number steeply increased instead of a perfect sequence match between the spacer of the host CRISPR/Cas system and the protospacer. Our findings suggest that AGV1 can escape from the host defense system and propagate under stressful conditions for the host by establishing an unstable carrier state. These results reveals a novel aspect of host-virus interactions in extreme environments.",

    "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in HIV eradication is to understand how the virus establishes latency, maintains stable cellular reservoirs, and promotes rebound upon interruption of antiretroviral treatment (ART). Here, we discovered an unexpected role of the ubiquitous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide (H2S) in HIV latency and reactivation. We show that reactivation of HIV-1 is associated with down-regulation of the key H2S producing enzyme cystathionine-{gamma}-lyase (CTH) and reduction in endogenous H2S. Genetic silencing of CTH disrupts redox homeostasis, impairs mitochondrial function, and remodels the transcriptome of latent cells to trigger HIV reactivation. Chemical complementation of CTH activity using a slow-releasing H2S donor, GYY4137, suppressed HIV reactivation and diminished virus replication. Mechanistically, GYY4137 blocked HIV reactivation by inducing the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, inhibiting NF-{kappa}B, and recruiting the epigenetic silencer, YY1, to the HIV promoter. In latently infected CD4+ T cells from ART-suppressed human subjects, GYY4137 in combination with ART prevented viral rebound and improved mitochondrial bioenergetics. Moreover, prolonged exposure to GYY4137 exhibited no adverse influence on proviral content or CD4+ T cell subsets, indicating that diminished viral rebound is due to a loss of transcription rather than a selective loss of infected cells. In summary, this work provides mechanistic insight into H2S-mediated suppression of viral rebound and suggests the inclusion of an H2S donor in the current ART regimen to achieve a functional HIV-1 cure.",

    "abstract": "HIV-1 cDNA pre-integration complexes have been shown to persist for weeks in macrophages and to be transcriptionally active. Early and late gene transcripts are produced, along with some viral proteins, yet whole virus is not. While previous work has focused on the transcription and translation of HIV-1 genes; our understanding of cellular milieu that accompanies viral production is incomplete. We have used an in vitro system to model HIV-1 infection of macrophages, and single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to compare the transcriptomes of uninfected cells, cells harboring pre-integration HIV-1 complexes (PIC) and those containing integrated provirus and actively making late HIV proteins. These are also compared to control cells, not exposed to virus.\n\nSeveral observations provide new perspective on the effects of HIV-1 transcription from pre-integrated cDNA versus from integrated provirus. First, HIV-1 transcript levels do not necessarily correlate with virus production, cells harboring PIC cDNA have transcript loads comparable to cells transcribing from provirus and making p24, mCherry, and vpu proteins. Second, all HIV-1 transcripts are easily detectable in abundance from PIC cDNA transcription, as is the case with cells transcribing from provirus, although the frequency of PIC cells with detectable gag-pol, tat, env, and nef transcripts is higher than the corresponding frequencies observed for \"Provirus cells\". Third, the background transcriptomes of cells harboring pre- integrated HIV-1 cDNA are not otherwise detectably altered from cells not containing any HIV- 1 transcript. Fourth, integration and production of p24, mCherry, and Vpu proteins is accompanied by a switch from transcriptomes characterized by NFkB and AP-1 promoted transcription to a transcriptome characterized by E2F family transcription products. While some of these observations may seem heretical, single cell analysis provides a more nuanced understanding of PIC cDNA transcription and the transcriptomic changes that support HIV-1 protein production from integrated provirus.\n\nAuthor SummarySingle cell analysis is able to distinguish between HIV-1 infected macrophage cells that are transcribing pre-integrated HIV-1 cDNA and those transcribing HIV-1 provirus. Only cells transcribing HIV-1 provirus are making p24, marker mCherry and Vpu proteins, which corresponds with a change in the host cells background transcriptome from one expressing viral restriction and immunological response genes to one that is expressing genes associated with cell replication and oxidative phosphorylation.",

    "abstract": "The host transmembrane protein MARCH8 is a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that downregulates various host transmembrane proteins, such as MHC-II. We have recently reported that MARCH8 expression in virus-producing cells impairs viral infectivity by reducing virion incorporation of not only HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins but also vesicular stomatitis virus G-glycoprotein through two different pathways. However, the MARCH8 inhibition spectrum remains largely unknown. Here, we investigate the antiviral spectrum of MARCH8 using HIV-1 pseudotyped with a variety of viral envelope glycoproteins. Pseudotyping experiments revealed that viral envelopes derived from the rhabdovirus, arenavirus, coronavirus, and togavirus (alphavirus) families were sensitive to MARCH8-mediated inhibition. Lysine mutations at the cytoplasmic tails of rabies virus-G, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoproteins, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, and Chikungunya virus and Ross River virus E2 proteins conferred resistance to MARCH8. Immunofluorescence showed impaired downregulation of the mutants of these viral envelopes by MARCH8, followed by lysosomal degradation, suggesting that MARCH8-mediated ubiquitination leads to intracellular degradation of these envelopes. Indeed, rabies virus-G and Chikungunya virus E2 proteins proved to be clearly ubiquitinated. We conclude that MARCH8 has inhibitory activity on a variety of viral envelope glycoproteins whose cytoplasmic lysine residues are targeted by this antiviral factor.",

    "abstract": "Host-defence caerin 1.9 peptide was originally isolated from skin secretion of Australian tree frog, and inhibits the growth of a wide range of bacteria in vitro. In this study, we demonstrated that caerin 1.9 shows high bioactivity against several bacteria strains, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter Baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and Streptococcus hemolyiicus in vitro. Importantly, unlike antibiotic Tazocin, caerin 1.9 does not induce bacterial resistance after 30 rounds of in vitro culture. Moreover, caerin 1.1, another peptide of caerin family, has additive antibacterial effect when used together with caerin 1.9. Furthermore, caerin 1.1 and 1.9 prepared in the form of a temperature sensitive gel inhibit MRSA growth in skin bacterial infection model of two murine strains. These results indicate that caerin 1.1 and 1.9 may have the advantage than conventional antibiotics against bacterial infection of skin.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUNDAntibiotic pollution of non-clinical environments might have a relevant impact on human health if resistant pathogens are selected. However, this potential risk is often overlooked, since drug concentrations in nature are usually below their minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Albeit, antibiotic resistant bacteria can be selected even at sub-MIC concentrations, in a range that is dubbed the sub-MIC selective window, which depends on both the antibiotic and the pathogen.\n\nOBJECTIVESDetermine the sub-MIC selective windows of seven antibiotics of clinical relevance in the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and evaluate the risk for selecting resistant mutants in nature, based on published data about the amount of antimicrobials detected in natural environments.\n\nMETHODSWe conducted evolution experiments of P. aeruginosa PA14 in presence of sub-MIC concentrations of ceftazidime, amikacin, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, polymyxin B or imipenem, and measured drug susceptibility of the evolved populations.\n\nRESULTSSub-MIC selective window of quinolones was the largest, and the ones of polymyxin B and imipenem, the narrowest. Clinically relevant multidrug resistant (MDR) mutants (presenting MICs above EUCAST clinical breakpoints) arose within the sub-MIC selective windows of the majority of antibiotics tested, being these phenotypes probably mediated by efflux pumps' activity.\n\nDISCUSSIONOur data show that the concentration of antibiotics reported in aquatic ecosystems -colonizable by P. aeruginosa- are, in occasions, higher than the ones able to select MDR mutants. This finding has implications for understanding the role of different ecosystems and conditions in the emergence of antibiotic resistance from a One-Health point of view. Further, it highlights the importance of delineating the sub-MIC selective windows for drugs of clinical value in pathogens with environmental niches, in order to evaluate the health risks due to antibiotic pollution of natural ecosystems and ultimately tackle antibiotic resistance.",

Physical decontamination methods like Ultraviolet radiation has shown to be promising. Here, we describe a novel device emitting ultraviolet C radiation (UVC), called NuvaWave, to rapidly and efficiently inactivate SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 was dried on a chambered glass slides and introduced in a NuvaWave robotic testing unit. The robot simulated waving NuvaWave over the virus at a pre-determined UVC radiation dose of 1, 2, 4 and 8 seconds. Post-UVC exposure, virus was recovered and titered by plaque assay in Vero E6 cells. We observed that relative control (no UVC exposure), exposure of the virus to UVC for one or two seconds resulted in a >2.9 and 3.8 log10 reduction in viral titers, respectively. Exposure of the virus to UVC for four or eight seconds resulted in a reduction of greater than 4.7-log10 reduction in viral titers. The NuvaWave device inactivates SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces to below the limit of detection within one to four seconds of UVC irradiation. This device can be deployed to rapidly disinfect surfaces from SARS-CoV-2, and to assist in mitigating its spread in a variety of settings.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is especially severe in aged populations1. Resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has been advanced by the recent development of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, but vaccine efficacy is partly compromised by the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants with enhanced transmissibility2. The emergence of these variants emphasizes the need for further development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies, especially in aged populations. Here, we describe the isolation of a new set of highly virulent mouse-adapted viruses and use them to test a novel therapeutic drug useful in infections of aged animals. Initially, we show that many of the mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 during mouse adaptation (at positions 417, 484, 501 of the spike protein) also arise in humans in variants of concern (VOC)2. Their appearance during mouse adaptation indicates that immune pressure is not required for their selection. Similar to the human infection, aged mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 develop more severe disease than young mice. In murine SARS, in which severity is also age-dependent, we showed that elevated levels of an eicosanoid, prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) and of a phospholipase, PLA2G2D, contributed to poor outcomes in aged mice3,4. Using our virulent mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2, we show that infection of middle-aged mice lacking expression of DP1, a PGD2 receptor, or PLA2G2D are protected from severe disease. Further, treatment with a DP1 antagonist, asapiprant, protected aged mice from a lethal infection. DP1 antagonism is one of the first interventions in SARS-CoV-2-infected animals that specifically protects aged animals, and demonstrates that the PLA2G2D-PGD2/DP1 pathway is a useful target for therapeutic interventions.

    "abstract": "Summary/AbstractFACT (FAcilitates Chromatin Transcription) is a heterodimeric protein complex composed of SUPT16H and SSRP1, and a histone chaperone participating in chromatin remodeling during gene transcription. FACT complex is profoundly regulated, and contributes to both gene activation and suppression. Here we reported that SUPT16H, a subunit of FACT, is acetylated at lysine 674 (K674) of middle domain (MD), which involves TIP60 histone acetyltransferase. Such acetylation of SUPT16H is recognized by bromodomain protein BRD4, which promotes protein stability of SUPT16H. We further demonstrated that SUPT16H-BRD4 associates with histone modification enzymes (EZH2, HDAC1) and affects histone marks (H3K9me3, H3K27me3 and H3ac). BRD4 is known to profoundly regulate interferon (IFN) signaling, while such function of SUPT16H has never been explored. Surprisingly, our results revealed that SUPT16H genetic knockdown via RNAi or pharmacological inhibition by using its inhibitor, curaxin 137 (CBL0137), results in the induction of IFNs and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Through this mechanism, CBL0137 is shown to efficiently inhibit infection of multiple viruses, including Zika, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we demonstrated that CBL0137 also causes the remarkable activation of IFN signaling in natural killer (NK) cells, which promotes the NK-mediated killing of virus-infected cells in a co-culture system using human primary NK cells. Overall, our studies unraveled the previously un-appreciated role of FACT complex in regulating IFN signaling in both epithelial and NK cells, and also proposed the novel application of CBL0137 to treat viral infections.",

We performed live-cell single-molecule tracking for RSC, SWI/SNF, CHD1, ISW1, ISW2, and INO80 remodeling complexes in budding yeast and detected hyperkinetic behaviors for chromatin-bound molecules that frequently transition to the free state for all complexes. Chromatin-bound remodelers display notably higher diffusion than nucleosomal histones, and strikingly fast dissociation kinetics with 4-7 s mean residence times. These enhanced dynamics require ATP binding or hydrolysis by the catalytic ATPase, uncovering an additional function to its established role in nucleosome remodeling. Kinetic simulations show that multiple remodelers can repeatedly occupy the same promoter region on a timescale of minutes, implicating an unending  tug-of-war that controls a temporally shifting window of accessibility for the transcription initiation machinery.",

    "abstract": "CRISPR/Cas9 system is an extremely powerful technique that is extensively used for various genome modifications in different organisms including parasitic protists. Giardia intestinalis, a protist parasite infecting about 280 million people around the world each year, has been eluding the routine use of CRISPR/Cas9 for generating knock-out cell lines due to the presence of four copies of each gene in its two nuclei. Apart from single exception employing rather laborious Cre/loxP system, no full knock-out cell line has been established yet. In this work, we show the ability of in-vitro assembled CRISPR/Cas9 components to successfully edit the genome of G. intestinalis. We further established a cell line stably expressing Cas9 in both G. intestinalis nuclei. Subsequent introduction of a template for homologous recombination containing the transcription units for the resistance marker and gRNA resulted in the removal of all gene copies at once for three independent experimental genes, mem, cwp1 and mlf1. The method was also applicable for the incomplete disruption of an essential gene, as documented by markedly decreased expression of tom40. Finally, testing the efficiency of Cas9-induced recombination revealed that homologous arms as short as 150 bp can be sufficient to establish a full knock-out cell line in G. intestinalis.",

Considering the stochastic model allows us to harness more features of experimental data, including cell trajectories and cell count data, which we show overcomes the parameter identifiability problem. We demonstrate that, whilst difficult to collect, cell trajectory data can provide more information about the parameters of the cell invasion model. To handle the intractability of the likelihood function of the stochastic model, we use an efficient ABC algorithm based on sequential Monte Carlo.

Production of functional donor-derived gametes through intra- or inter-specific spermatogonial stem cell transplantation (SSCT) has been achieved in many species. However, generation of functional gametes from a phylogenetically distant species such as from a different subfamily by SSCT has never been successful. Here, using two small cyprinid fishes, Chinese rare minnow (gobiocypris rarus, for brief: Gr) and zebrafish (danio rerio), which belong to different subfamilies, as donors and recipients for SSCT, we optimized the SSCT technique and successfully obtained Gr-derived sperm carrying targeted genome modifications in zebrafish. We revealed that the transplanted Gr spermatogonia supported the host gonadal development and underwent normal spermatogenesis, resulting in a reconstructed fertile testis containing Gr spermatids and zebrafish testicular somatic cells. Interestingly, the surrogate spermatozoa resembled those of host zebrafish but not donor Gr in morphology and swimming behavior. Finally, we showed that Gr-derived genome edited sperm was successfully produced in zebrafish by cross-subfamily SSCT, when the pou5f3 and chd gene knockout Gr SSCs were used as surrogate donors. This is the first report demonstrating the surrogate production of genome edited sperm from a phylogenetically distant species, and this method is feasible to be applied to future breeding of commercial fishes.",

    "abstract": "The regulation of river systems alters hydrodynamics and often reduces lateral connectivity between river channels and floodplains. For taxa such as frogs that rely on floodplain wetlands to complete their lifecycle, decreasing inundation frequency can reduce recruitment and increase the probability of local extinction. We virtually reconstructed the inundation patterns of wetlands under natural and regulated flow conditions and built stochastic population models to quantify the probability of local extinction under different inundation scenarios. Specifically, we explored the interplay of habitat size, inundation frequency, and successive dry years on the local extinction probability of the threatened southern bell frog Litoria raniformis in the Murray River floodplains of South Australia. We hypothesised that the changes to wetland inundation resulting from river regulation are a principal driver of L. raniformis declines in this semi-arid system.\n\nRegulation has reduced the inundation frequency of essential habitats below critical thresholds for the persistence of many fresh water-dependent species. Successive dry years raise the probability of local extinction, and these effects are strongest in smaller wetlands. Larger wetlands and those with more frequent average inundation are less susceptible to these effects.\n\nElucidating these trends informs the prioritisation of treatment sites and the frequency of conservation interventions. Environmental water provision (through pumping or the operation of flow-regulating structures) is a promising tool to reduce the probability of breeding failure and local extinction. Our modelling approach can be used to prioritise the delivery of environmental water to L. raniformis and potentially many other frog species.",

    "abstract": "Bacteriophages rely almost exclusively on host-cell machinery to produce their proteins, and their mRNAs must therefore compete with host mRNAs for valuable translational resources. In many bacterial species, highly translated mRNAs are characterized by the presence of a Shine-Dalgarno sequence motif upstream of the start codon and weak secondary structure within the start codon region. However, the general constraints and principles underlying the translation of phage mRNAs are largely unknown. Here, we show that phage mRNAs are highly enriched in strong Shine-Dalgarno sequences and have comparatively weaker secondary structures in the start codon region than host-cell mRNAs. Phage mRNAs appear statistically similar to the most highly expressed host genes in E. coli according to both features, strongly suggesting that they initiate translation at particularly high rates. Interestingly, we find that these observations are driven largely by virulent phages and that temperate phages encode mRNAs with similar start codon features to their host genes. These findings apply broadly across a wide-diversity of host-species and phage genomes. Further study of phage translational regulation--with a particular emphasis on virulent phages--may provide new strategies for engineering phage genomes and recombinant expression systems more generally.",

    "abstract": "Gene conversion is GC-biased across a wide range of taxa. Large palindromes on mammalian sex chromosomes undergo frequent gene conversion that maintains arm-to-arm sequence identity greater than 99%, which may increase their susceptibility to the effects of GC-biased gene conversion. Here, we demonstrate a striking history of GC-biased gene conversion in 12 palindromes conserved on the X chromosomes of human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque. Primate X-chromosome palindrome arms have significantly higher GC content than flanking single-copy sequences. Nucleotide replacements that occurred in human and chimpanzee palindrome arms over the past 7 million years are one-and-a-half times as GC-rich than the ancestral bases they replaced. Using simulations, we show that our observed pattern of nucleotide replacements is consistent with GC-biased gene conversion with a magnitude of 70%, similar to previously reported values based on analyses of human meioses. However, GC-biased gene conversion explains only a fraction of the observed difference in GC content between palindrome arms and flanking sequence, suggesting that additional factors are required to explain elevated GC content in palindrome arms. This work supports a greater than 2:1 preference for GC bases over AT bases during gene conversion, and demonstrates that the evolution and composition of mammalian sex chromosome palindromes is strongly influenced by GC-biased gene conversion.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundMycosis fungoides (MF) is the most common cutaneous T cell lymphoma, which in the early patch/plaque stages runs an indolent course. However, ~25% of MF patients develop skin tumors, a hallmark of progression to the advanced stage and associated with high mortality. The mechanisms involved in stage progression are poorly elucidated.\n\nMethodsWe performed whole-transcriptome and whole-exome sequencing of malignant MF cells from skin biopsies obtained by laser-capture microdissection. We compared three types of MF lesions: early-stage plaques (ESP, n=12), and plaques and tumors from patients in late-stage disease (late-stage plaques, LSP, n=10, and tumors, TMR, n=15). Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG analysis were used to determine pathway changes specific for different lesions which we linked to the recurrent somatic mutations overrepresented in MF tumors.\n\nResultsThe key upregulated pathways during stage progression were those related to cell proliferation and survival (MEK/ERK, Akt-mTOR), Th2/Th9 signaling (IL4, STAT3, STAT5, STAT6), meiomitosis (CT45A1, CT45A3, STAG3, GTSF1, and REC8) and DNA repair (PARP1, MYCN, OGG1). Principal coordinate clustering of the transcriptome revealed extensive gene expression differences between early (ESP) and advanced-stage lesions (LSP and TMR). LSP and TMR showed remarkable similarities at the level of the transcriptome, which we interpreted as evidence of cell percolation between lesions via hematogenous self-seeding.\n\nConclusionStage progression in MF is associated with Th2/Th9 polarization of malignant cells, activation of proliferation, survival, as well as increased genomic instability.

    "abstract": "Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a pivotal imaging technique for studying the structure of pleomorphic enveloped viruses and their interactions with the host at native conditions. Owing to the limited tilting range of samples with a slab geometry, electron tomograms suffer from so-called missing wedge information in Fourier space. In dual-axis cryo-ET, two tomograms reconstructed from orthogonally oriented tilt series are combined into a tomogram with improved resolution as the missing wedge information is reduced to a pyramid. Volta phase plate (VPP) allows to perform in-focus cryo-ET with high contrast transfer at low-resolution frequencies and thus its application may improve the quality of dual-axis tomograms. Here, we compare dual-axis cryo-ET with and without VPP on Ebola virus-like particles to visualize and segment viral and host cell proteins within the membrane-enveloped filamentous particles. Dual-axis VPP cryo-ET reduces the missing wedge information and ray artifacts arising from the weighted back-projection during tomogram reconstruction, thereby minimizing ambiguity in the analysis of crowded environments and facilitating 3D segmentation. We show that dual-axis VPP tomograms provide a comprehensive description of macromolecular organizations such as nucleocapsid assembly states, the distribution of glycoproteins on the viral envelope and asymmetric arrangements of the VP40 layer in non-filamentous regions of virus-like particles. Our data reveal actin filaments within virus-like particles in close proximity to the viral VP40 scaffold, suggesting a direct interaction between VP40 and actin filaments. Dual-axis VPP cryo-ET provides more complete 3D information at high contrast and allows for better interpretation of macromolecule interactions and pleomorphic organizations.\n\nHighlightsO_LIVolta phase plate dual-axis cryo-electron tomography provides high contrast tomography data with reduced back-projection ray artifacts and missing wedge information in Fourier space\nC_LIO_LIVolta phase plate dual-axis cryo-electron tomography facilitates interpretation of protein-membrane interactions\nC_LIO_LIVolta phase plate dual-axis cryo-electron tomography reduces ambiguity in manual 3D rendering and markedly improves 3D isosurface modeling\nC_LIO_LIEbola virus-like particles contain actin filaments in close proximity to the VP40 layer\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "Multiple cellular processes, such as immune responses and cancer cell metastasis, crucially depend on interconvertible migration modes. However, knowledge is scarce on how infectious agents impact the processes of cell adhesion and migration at restrictive biological barriers. In extracellular matrix, dendritic cells (DCs) infected by the obligate intracellular protozoan Toxoplasma gondii undergo mesenchymal-to-amoeboid transition (MAT) for rapid integrin-independent migration. Here, in a cellular model of the blood-brain barrier, we report that parasitised DCs adhere to polarised endothelium and shift to integrin-dependent motility, accompanied by elevated transendothelial migration (TEM). Upon contact with endothelium, parasitised DCs dramatically reduced velocities and adhered under both static and shear stress conditions, thereby obliterating the infection-induced amoeboid motility displayed in collagen matrix. The motility of adherent parasitised DCs on endothelial monolayers was restored by blockade of {beta}1 and {beta}2 integrins or ICAM-1, which conversely reduced motility on collagen-coated surfaces. Moreover, parasitised DCs exhibited enhanced translocation across highly polarised primary murine brain endothelial cell monolayers. Blockade of {beta}1, {beta}2 integrins, ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 reduced TEM frequencies. Finally, gene silencing of the pan-integrin-cytoskeleton linker talin (Tln1) or of {beta}1 integrin (Itgb1) in primary DCs resulted in increased motility on endothelium and decreased TEM. Adding to the paradigms of leukocyte diapedesis, the findings provide novel insights in how an intracellular pathogen impacts the migratory plasticity of leukocytes in response to the cellular environment, to promote infection-related dissemination.",

Here we use Mycobacterium marinum infection of zebrafish embryos and Mycobacterium tuberculosis of human THP-1 cells to demonstrate that pathogenic mycobacteria upregulate the host WNK signalling pathway kinases SPAK and OXSR1 which control intracellular potassium balance. We show that genetic depletion or inhibition of OXSR1 decreases bacterial burden and intracellular potassium levels. The protective effects of OXSR1 depletion are mediated by NLRP3 inflammasome activation and are dependent on caspase-mediated release of IL-1{beta} and the downstream activation of protective TNF-.

    "abstract": "Biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi have evolved the ability to colonize living plant cells, but how they establish biotrophic growth by remodeling gene expression is poorly understood. By using in planta invasive hyphae (IH) of Magnaporthe oryzae to perform an integrated Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIPseq) and RNA-seq analysis, combining with biological and cellular analyses, we found Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated epigenetic repression plays a key role in regulating biotrophic growth. ChIPseq for biotrophic IH samples identified 1701 PRC2 target genes. RNA-seq analysis showed that expression of 462 PRC2 target genes were up-regulated in the {Delta}suz12 mutant, while 82 were down-regulated, indicating a major role of PRC2 in gene repression of IH. During biotrophic growth, PRC2 repressed fungal cell wall synthesis genes and extracellular enzyme genes required for penetration, and secondary metabolites biosynthesis genes required for necrotrophic growth. A great number of effector-encoding genes were repressed by PRC2, which were highly expressed during penetration stage, suggesting PRC2 coordinates biotrophic growth by regulating effector suppression for immune evasion. This regulation was finely coordinated by Pmk1, through regulating phosphorylation, nuclear localization and protein abundance of Suz12. Our results indicate that the Pmk1-PRC2 regulatory module is required for gene remodeling to facilitate biotrophic growth in M. oryzae.\n\nIMPORTANCEBiotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi establish a biotrophic stage for infection in host cells. For example, M. oryzae forms appressoria to penetrate host cell and establish a biotrophic growth stage for infection. How gene expression patterns are elaborately controlled for fungal biotrophic growth is largely unknown. In this study, we found that, the PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 repressed fungal penetration-required cell wall synthesis genes and extracellular enzyme genes, and necrotrophic growth-required secondary metabolites biosynthesis genes for biotrophic growth. Interestingly, a great number of effector-encoding genes were also repressed by PRC2 at biotrophic stage, which were highly expressed at penetration stage, suggesting PRC2 coordinates biotrophic growth by regulating effector suppression for immune evasion. The PRC2-mediated epigenetic repression is therefore required for the gene expression remodeling during fungal infection. This regulation was finely coordinated by Pmk1, through regulating nuclear localization and protein abundance of the PRC2 component Suz12.",

    "abstract": "The putative circadian clock system of the facultative heterotrophic cyanobacterial strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 comprises the following three Kai-based systems: a KaiABC-based potential oscillator that is linked to the SasA-RpaA two-component output pathway and two additional KaiBC systems without a cognate KaiA component. Mutants lacking the genes encoding the KaiAB1C1 components or the response regulator RpaA show reduced growth in light/dark cycles and do not show heterotrophic growth in the dark. In the present study, the effect of these mutations on central metabolism was analyzed by targeted and nontargeted metabolite profiling. The strongest metabolic changes were observed in the dark in {Delta}rpaA and, to a lesser extent, in the {Delta}kaiAB1C1 mutant. These observations included the overaccumulation of 2-phosphoglycolate, which correlated with the overaccumulation of the RbcL subunit in the mutants, and taken together, these data suggest enhanced RubisCO activity in the dark. The imbalanced carbon metabolism in the {Delta}rpaA mutant extended to the pyruvate family of amino acids, which showed increased accumulation in the dark. Hence, the deletion of the response regulator rpaA had a more pronounced effect on metabolism than the deletion of the kai genes. The larger impact of the rpaA mutation is in agreement with previous transcriptomic analyses and likely relates to a KaiAB1C1-independent function as a transcription factor. Collectively, our data demonstrate an important role of homologs of clock proteins in Synechocystis for balanced carbon and nitrogen metabolism during light-to-dark transitions.",

Gradients and readout mechanisms are inevitably variable, yet the resulting patterns are strikingly precise. Measurement limitations currently preclude precise detection of morphogen gradients over long distances. Here, we develop a new formalism to estimate gradient precision along the entire patterning axis from measurements close to the source. Using numerical simulations, we infer gradient variability from measured molecular noise levels in morphogen production, decay, and diffusion. The predicted precision is much higher than previously measured--precise enough to allow even single gradients to define the central progenitor boundaries during neural tube development. Finally, we show that the patterning mechanism is optimized for precise progenitor cell numbers, rather than precise boundary positions, as the progenitor domain size is particularly robust to gradient alterations. We conclude that single gradients can yield the observed developmental precision, which provides new prospects for tissue engineering.",

Here we compare the effect of environmental stochasticity with the effect of periodic (e.g., seasonal) cycles, using analytic solutions and individual-based Monte-Carlo simulations. Even when stochasticity facilitates coexistence it still allows for rare sequences of bad years that may drive a population to extinction, therefore the stabilizing effect of periodic variations is stronger. Correspondingly, the mean time to extinction grows exponentially with community size in periodic environment and switch to power-law dependence under stochastic fluctuations. On the other hand, the number of temporal niches in periodic environment is typically lower, so as diversity increases stochastic temporal variations may support higher species richness.",

Here, we employ the rodent genus Peromyscus as a model to explore differences in evolutionary rates between testes-expressed genes in monogamous and promiscuous species. We find candidate genes that may be associated with increased sperm production in promiscuous species and gene ontology categories that show patterns of molecular convergence associated with phenotypic convergence in independently evolved monogamous species.

    "abstract": "How do large and unique brains evolve? Historically, comparative neuroanatomical studies have attributed the evolutionary genesis of highly encephalized brains to deviations along, as well as from, conserved scaling relationships among brain regions. However, the relative contributions of these concerted (integrated) and mosaic (modular) processes as drivers of brain evolution remain unclear, especially in non-mammalian groups. While proportional brain sizes have been the predominant metric used to characterize brain morphology to date, we perform a high-density geometric morphometric analysis on the encephalized brains of crown birds (Neornithes or Aves) compared to their stem taxa--the non-avialan coelurosaurian dinosaurs. When analyzed together with developmental neuroanatomical data of model archosaurs (Gallus, Alligator), crown birds exhibit a distinct allometric relationship that dictates their brain evolution and development. Furthermore, analyses by neuroanatomical regions reveal that the acquisition of this derived shape-to-size scaling relationship occurred in a mosaic pattern, where the  avian-grade optic lobe and cerebellum evolved first among non-avialan dinosaurs, followed by major changes to the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of cerebrum shape after the origin of Avialae.\n\nNotably, the brain of crown birds is a more integrated structure than non-avialan archosaurs, implying that diversification of brain morphologies within Neornithes proceeded in a more coordinated manner, perhaps due to spatial constraints and abbreviated growth period. Collectively, these patterns demonstrate a plurality in evolutionary processes that generate encephalized brains in archosaurs and across vertebrates.",

    "abstract": "Mutations in, or deficiency of, FMRP is responsible for the Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause for inherited intellectual disability. FMRP is a nucleocytoplasmic protein, primarily characterized as a translation repressor with poorly understood nuclear function(s). We recently uncovered a genome protective role of FMRP. We reported that FXS patient-derived cells lacking FMRP sustain higher level of DNA double-strand breaks than normal cells, a phenotype further exacerbated by DNA replication stress. The stress-induced DSBs occur at sequences prone to form R-loops, which are co-transcriptional RNA:DNA hybrids that have been associated with genome instability. Concordantly, we showed that FXS cells accumulate R-loops under replication stress. Moreover, expression of FMRP and not a mutant deficient in binding nucleic acids and known to cause FXS, FMRPI304N, reduced R-loop-associated DSBs. These observations demonstrated that FMRP promotes genome integrity by preventing R-loop accumulation and chromosome breakage. Here, we explore the mechanism through which FMRP prevents R-loop accumulation in an isogenically controlled CRISPR KO of FMR1 (gene encoding for FMRP) in HEK293T cells. We demonstrate for the first time that FMRP directly binds R-loops. We show that FMRP interacts with DHX9, an RNA helicase that unwinds both double strand RNA and RNA:DNA hybrids and regulates R-loop formation through modulating these activities. This interaction is reduced with FMRPI304N, suggesting that FMRP regulation of R-loop is mediated through DHX9. Interestingly, we show that FMRP inhibits DHX9 helicase activity on RNA:DNA hybrids. Moreover, DHX9 binds chromatin containing R-loops more efficiently in the absence of a functional FMRP. These results suggest an antagonistic relationship between FMRP and DHX9 at the chromatin, where FMRP prevents R-loop formation by suppressing DHX9. Our study sheds new light on our understanding of the genome functions of FMRP.",

    "abstract": "Airborne diseases are the leading cause of infectious disease-related deaths in the world. In particular, the influenza virus activates a network of immune cells that leads to clearance or an overzealous response that can be fatal. Tight regulation of the cytokines that enable proper activation and function of immune cells is necessary to clear infections efficiently while minimizing damage to the host. Interleukin-7 (IL-7) is a cytokine known for its importance in T cell development and survival. How IL-7 shapes CD8 T cell responses during an acute viral infection is less understood. We had previously shown that IL-7 signaling deficient mice have reduced accumulation of influenza-specific CD8 T cells following infection. We sought to determine whether IL-7 affects early CD8 T cell expansion in the mediastinal lymph node and effector function in the lungs. Using IL-7R signaling deficient mice, we show that IL-7 is required for a normal sized mediastinal lymph node and the early clonal expansion of antigen-specific CD8 T cells therein. Bone marrow chimeric models and adoptive transfer of transgenic TCR CD8 T cells reveal a cell-intrinsic role for IL-7 in the accumulation of NP366-374 and PA224-233-specific CD8 T cells. We also found that IL-7 dictates terminal differentiation, degranulation and cytokine production in PA224-233-specific but not NP366-374-specific CD8 T cells. We further demonstrate that IL-7 is induced in the lung tissue by viral infection and we characterize multiple cellular sources that contribute to IL-7 production. Drugs that manipulate IL-7 signaling are currently under clinical trial for multiple conditions. Our findings on IL-7 and its effects on lower respiratory diseases will be important for expanding the utility of these therapeutics.\n\nAuthor SummaryInterleukin-7 plays an important role in development of immune cells such as lymphocytes. In recent years, its role in the immune system has been expanded beyond the development of immune cells to include revitalizing of lymphocytes during tumor and chronic viral response. We show here that IL-7 is required for accumulation and function of specialized lymphocytes in the lungs during an acute influenza infection.",

    "abstract": "DNA double strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination (HR) is thought to be restricted to the S- and G2- phases of the cell cycle in part due to 53BP1 antagonizing DNA end resection in G1-phase and non-cycling quiescent (G0) cells. Here, we show that LIN37, a component of the DREAM transcriptional repressor, functions in a 53BP1-independent manner to prevent DNA end resection and HR in G0 cells. Loss of LIN37 leads to expression of HR proteins, including BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51, and DNA end resection in G0 cells even in the presence of 53BP1. In contrast to 53BP1-deficiency, DNA end resection in LIN37-deficient G0 cells depends on BRCA1 and leads to RAD51 filament formation and HR. LIN37 is not required to protect DNA ends in cycling cells at G1-phase. Thus, LIN37 regulates a novel 53BP1-independent cell phase-specific DNA end protection pathway that functions uniquely in quiescent cells.",

    "abstract": "Comparison of water and sewerage company pollution performance in relation to severity, frequency and self-reporting of pollution incidents is made difficult by differences in environmental and operational conditions. In England, the deterioration in pollution incident performance across the water industry, makes it important to investigate common trends that could be addressed at national and regional levels. Yet, to date there has been no external peer-reviewed analysis of national pollution incident data in England. This project aimed to analyse available pollution incident data to assess and compare the performance of water and sewerage companies in England. Results indicated that there was significant variation in pollution incident numbers and the severity of the impact on the water environment for different asset types (operational property of the water and sewerage company such as a sewage treatment works). Increasing numbers of pollution incidents from pumping stations and sewage treatment works, were largely responsible for overall increases in pollution incidents. The highest increase in pollution incidents in 2019, was observed from pumping stations. Variation was evident in company self-reporting percentages across asset types. There were significant positive relationships between the self-reporting percentages of pollution incidents and total numbers of reported pollution incidents per 10,000 km sewer length for pumping stations and sewage treatment works. These results indicate that in at least these asset types, an estimated 5% of pollution incidents could go unreported, if not self-reported by the company. Pollution events not reported quickly by companies, can lead to more severe impacts to the water environment so rapid and consistent reporting of incidents is crucial for limiting damage. The results have significance for the water industry internationally, because the issues presented here are not restricted to England. Whilst this research highlighted a number of key areas for more detailed analysis, in the short-term, research should focus on investigating best practice for reporting pollution incidents. It is important to get an accurate baseline of the number of pollution incidents and whether a proportion are currently going unreported. This research should seek to aid the standardisation of reporting practice across the water industry.",

    "abstract": "Primate evolution has led to a remarkable diversity of behavioral specializations and pronounced brain size variation among species 1,2. Gene expression provides a promising opportunity for studying the molecular basis of brain evolution, but it has been explored in very few primate species to date e.g. 3,4. To understand the landscape of gene expression evolution across the primate lineage, we generated and analyzed RNA-Seq data from four brain regions in an unprecedented eighteen species. Here we show a remarkable level of variation in gene expression among hominid species, including humans and chimpanzees, despite their relatively recent divergence time from other primates. We found that individual genes display a wide range of expression dynamics across evolutionary time reflective of the diverse selection pressures acting on genes within primate brain tissue. Using our sample that represents an unprecedented 190-fold difference in primate brain size, we identified genes with variation in expression most correlated with brain size and found several with signals of positive selection in their regulatory regions. Our study extensively broadens the context of what is known about the molecular evolution of the brain across primates and identifies novel candidate genes for study of genetic regulation of brain development and evolution.",

    "abstract": "RationaleReward-associated cues can trigger incentive motivation for reward and invigorate reward-seeking behaviour via Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer (PIT). Glutamate signaling within the basolateral amygdala (BLA) modulates cue-triggered increases in incentive motivation. However, the role of BLA metabotropic group II glutamate (mGlu2/3) receptors is largely unknown.\n\nObjectivesIn Experiment 1, we characterized cue-triggered increases in incentive motivation for water reward using the PIT paradigm. In Experiment 2, we assessed the influence of intra-BLA microinjections of the mGlu2/3 receptor agonist LY379268 on this effect.\n\nMethodsWater-restricted male Sprague-Dawley rats learned to press a lever for water. Separately, they learned to associate one of two auditory cues with free water. On test days, rats could lever press under extinction conditions (no water), with intermittent, non-contingent CS+ and CS- presentations. In Experiment 1, rats were tested under baseline conditions. In Experiment 2, rats received intra-BLA microinjections of LY379268 (0, 3 and 6 g/hemisphere) before testing.\n\nResultsAcross experiments, CS+, but not CS- presentations increased water-associated lever pressing during testing, even though responding was reinforced neither by water nor the CS+. Intra-BLA LY379268 abolished both CS+ potentiated pressing on the water-associated lever and CS+ evoked conditioned approach to the site of water delivery. LY379268 did not influence locomotion or instrumental and Pavlovian response rates during intervals between CS presentations or during the CS-, indicating no motor effects.\n\nConclusionsmGlu2/3 receptor activity in the BLA mediates CS-triggered potentiation of incentive motivation for reward, suppressing both CS-induced increases in instrumental pursuit of the reward and anticipatory approach behaviour.",

    "abstract": "Axin is one of two essential scaffolds in the canonical Wnt pathway that converts signals at the plasma membrane to signals inhibiting the degradation of {beta}-catenin, leading to its accumulation and specific gene activation. In vertebrates there are two forms of Axin, Axin1 and Axin2, which are similar at the protein level and genetically redundant. We show here that differential regulation of the two genes on the transcriptional and proteostatic level confers robustness and differential responsiveness that can be used in tissue specific regulation. Such subtle features may distinguish other redundant gene pairs that are commonly found in vertebrates through gene knockout experiments.\n\nSignificance StatementThe mystery of two functionally redundant Axin genes in all vertebrates are can now be explained by the demonstration that they form a nested proteostatic and transcriptional feedback system that confers regulatory options in different developmental settings, a form of dynamic versatility that may explain the widespread occurrence of closely related seemingly redundant genes with similar functions.",

    "abstract": "Intravenous Immunoglobulins (IVIGs) are prepared from thousands of donor plasmas and as a result comprise an extreme broad mix and depth of Antibody (Ab) specificities. IVIG formulations available in Australia are from both local and overseas donor sources and extracted using a variety of purification methods and immunoglobulin purities, with the Australia-derived and prepared IVIG listed at >98% and the overseas-derived preparations at [&ge;] 95%. Because of these differences it was predicted that the formulations might individually vary in composition and that together with obvious genetic and geographic antigenic (Ag) environment differences may result in notable variability between formulations. Hence a focussed comparative proteomic profiling of IVIG formulations was undertaken to identify notable similarities and differences across products. Comparisons between formulations did reveal marked qualitative differences in 2D-gel Antibody profiling that included parameters of isoelectric charge (pI), as well as immunoglobulin (Ig) monomer to dimer ratio variability between products, including high molecular weight (MW) immunoglobulin multimers for some. These notable differences were in part quite likely a product of the respective purification methods used, and capacity to select (or de-select) for antibodies of such different properties. Furthermore, for identification of non-Ig proteins carried over from plasma through purifications Mass spectrometry was performed. This identified a few such ancillary proteins, and their identities, in general, differed between formulations. Proteins detected included the most abundant protein of plasma, albumin, as well as other mostly large and abundant proteins; RAG1 - V(D)J recombination activating protein1, gelsolin, complement Factor-B, serotransferrin, tetranectin, NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, caspase 3 and VEGFR1. An alternate strategy used commercial Multiplex xMAP assay to detect cytokines, which are small and present in plasma at trace but highly active quantities. This revealed various different cytokine profiles across the formulations studied. The identification of additional proteins, and especially cytokines in IVIGs, is particularly notable, and the positive, negative or null biological relevance for clinical use, needs resolution. Collectively these findings reveal marked differences between Australian and overseas-derived (non-Australian) IVIGs in immunoglobulin composition and biochemical characteristics, and presence of additional carry-over proteins from plasma. These findings prompt the need for further evaluation of the micro-compositions of individual formulations. Perhaps detailed mining and improved comparative understanding of each IVIG formulation, may enable highly tailored and strategic clinical use of certain formulations that are personalised best-fit treatments for particular conditions. Such as in treatment of a neuropathy, as compared to another formulation, more suited for treating a particular infectious disease. The most salient and overarching study conclusion is need for caution in attributing equivalence across IVIGs.",

Due to the complexity and diversity of tumors, the response of cancer cells to drugs is also heterogeneous, and thus proteome analysis at single cell level is needed. Here we demonstrate that single cell proteomics techniques have become quantitative enough to tackle the drug effects on the target proteins, enabling single cell chemical proteomics (SCCP). Using SCCP, we studied here the time-resolved response of individual adenocarcinoma A549 cells to anticancer drugs methotrexate, camptothecin and tomudex, revealing the early emergence of cellular subpopulations committed and uncommitted to death. As a novel and useful approach to exploring the heterogeneous response to drugs of cancer cells, SCCP may prove to be a \"killer application\" for single cell proteomics.",
