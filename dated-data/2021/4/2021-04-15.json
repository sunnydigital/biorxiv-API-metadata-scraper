    "abstract": "Bacteria deploy weapons to kill their neighbours during competition for resources and aid survival within microbiomes. Colicins were the first antibacterial system identified yet how these bacteriocins cross the outer membrane of Escherichia coli is unknown. Here, by solving the structures of translocation intermediates and imaging toxin import, we uncover the mechanism by which the Tol-dependent nuclease colicin E9 (ColE9) crosses the outer membrane. We show that threading of ColE9s disordered domain through two pores of the trimeric porin OmpF causes the colicin to disengage from its primary receptor, BtuB, and reorganise the translocon either side of the membrane. These rearrangements prime the toxin for import through the lumen of a single OmpF subunit, which is driven by the proton motive force-linked TolQ-TolR-TolA-TolB assembly. Our study explains why OmpF is a better translocator than OmpC and reconciles the mechanisms by which Ton- and Tol- dependent bacteriocins cross the bacterial outer membrane.",

    "abstract": "Flavonoids are small metabolites of plants, which are involved in the regulation of plant development as well as defence against pathogens. Quantitation of these flavonoids in plant samples is highly important and essential in the food and herbal industry. Hence, robust, reliable and sensitive methods are required for the analysis of these compounds in plant samples. In the present study, a high performance liquid chromatographic-tandem mass spectrometric (HPLC- ESI-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of nine flavonoids, including Liquiritigenin, Naringenin, Genistein, Daidzein, Formononetin, Biochanin A, 2-hydroxy formononetin, 2-methoxyformononetin, Medicarpin, and two phytohormones, Salicylic acid and Jasmonic acid, in Medicago truncatula. The analytes were separated by means of C-18, reversed-phase chromatography and detected using QTRAP mass spectrometer. Molecules were quantified using different transitions in positive and negative ion modes simultaneously in 12 minutes. The on-column limit of detection of all the analytes was as low as 0.03 pg, whereas the limit of quantification of all the compounds was observed upto 0.1 pg levels. Further the method was also validated in terms of specificity, linearity (r2> 0.99), average recovery (90.6 - 110.3%), accuracy (RE% [&le;] 3%) and precision (RSD% [&le;] 3%). As a proof of concept, the developed method was successfully used for the quantitation of these flavonoids and phytohormones from leaf extract of Medicago truncatula.",

    "abstract": "Structured AbstractO_ST_ABSBackgroundC_ST_ABSPathogenic germline variants (PGV) in cancer susceptibility genes are usually identified in cancer patients through germline testing of DNA from blood or saliva: their detection can impact patient treatment options and potential risk reduction strategies for relatives. PGV can also be identified, in tumor sequencing assays, often performed without matched normal specimens. It is then critical to determine whether detected variants are somatic or germline. Here, we evaluate the clinical utility of computational inference of mutational status in tumor-only sequencing compared to germline testing results.\n\nPatients and MethodsTumor-only sequencing data from 1,608 patients were retrospectively analyzed to infer germline-versus-somatic status of variants using an information-theoretic, gene-independent approach. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also determined. The predicted mutational models were compared to clinical germline testing results. Statistical measures were computed to evaluate performance.\n\nResultsTumor-only sequencing detected 3,988 variants across 70 cancer susceptibility genes for which germline testing data were available. Our analysis imputed germline-versus-somatic status for >75% of all detected variants, with a sensitivity of 65%, specificity of 88%, and overall accuracy of 86% for pathogenic variants. False omission rate was 3%, signifying minimal error in misclassifying true PGV. A higher portion of PGV in known hereditary tumor suppressors were found to be retained with LOH in the tumor specimens (72%) compared to variants of uncertain significance (58%).\n\nConclusionsTumor-only sequencing provides sufficient power to distinguish germline and somatic variants and infer LOH. Although accurate detection of PGV from tumor-only data is possible, analyzing sequencing data in the context of specimens tumor cell content allows systematic exclusion of somatic variants, and suggests a balance between type 1 and 2 errors for identification of patients with candidate PGV for standard germline testing. Our approach, implemented in a user-friendly bioinformatics application, facilities objective analysis of tumor-only data in clinical settings.\n\nHighlightsO_LIMost pathogenic germline variants in cancer predisposition genes can be identified by analyzing tumor-only sequencing data.\nC_LIO_LIInformation-theoretic gene-independent analysis of common sequencing data accurately infers germline vs. somatic status.\nC_LIO_LIA reasonable statistical balance can be established between sensitivity and specificity demonstrating clinical utility.\nC_LIO_LIPathogenic germline variants are more often detected with loss of heterozygosity vs. germline variants of uncertain significance.\nC_LI",

    "abstract": "With the continued promise of immunotherapy as an avenue for treating cancer, understanding how host genetics contributes to the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) is essential to tailoring cancer screening and treatment strategies. Approaches that intersect SNP modifiers of molecular phenotype, such as gene expression, with disease phenotypes have shown promise for implicating causal genetic factors. Here we evaluated 194 literature-curated TIME associations and 890 associations detected with 157 immune phenotype (IP) components found using genotypes from over 8,000 individuals in The Cancer Genome Atlas. Of these 1084, 233 associations comprising 219 unique TIME-SNPs were also cancer relevant, associating with cancer risk, survival, and/or immunotherapy treatment response. Many cancer relevant TIME-SNPS overlapped regions of active transcription, and were associated with gene expression in specific immune cell subsets, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. TIME-SNPs associated with cancer risk and response to immunotherapy implicated genes involved in antigen presentation, especially by antigen presenting cells. The strongest associations with survival were with PD-L1 and CTLA-4, suggesting that SNPs modifying the potential for immune evasion could contribute to disease progression. To assess whether our approach could reveal novel cancer immunotherapy targets, we inhibited CTSS, a gene implicated by cancer risk and immunotherapy response-associated TIME-SNPs; CTSS inhibition resulted in slowed tumor growth and extended survival in vivo. These results validate the potential of cancer relevant TIME-SNPs to implicate target genes for countering immune suppressive characteristics of the TIME and set the stage for future host genetics analysis integrating germline variation and TIME characteristics.\n\nSignificanceA systematic screen for common germline variants associated with the tumor immune microenvironment across > 8000 tumors reveals novel cancer risk factors and targets for immunotherapy.",

    "abstract": "Chimeric antigen receptor-modified (CAR) T cells targeting CD19 have mediated dramatic responses in relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), yet a notable number of patients have CD19-positive relapse within one year of treatment. It remains unclear if the long-term response is associated with the characteristics of CAR T cells in infusion products, hindering the identification of biomarkers to predict therapeutic outcomes prior to treatment. Herein we present 101,326 single cell transcriptomes and surface protein landscape from the CAR T infusion products of 12 pediatric ALL patients upon CAR antigen-specific stimulation in comparison with TCR-mediated activation and controls. We observed substantial heterogeneity in the antigen-specific activation states, among which a deficiency of Th2 function was associated with CD19-positive relapsed patients (median remission 9.6 months) compared with very durable responders (remission>54 months). Proteomic profiles also revealed that the frequency of early memory T cell subsets, rather than activation or co-inhibitory signatures could distinguish CD19-positive relapse. Additionally, a deficit of type 1 helper and cytotoxic effector function and an enrichment for terminally differentiated CD8+ T cells exhibiting low cytokine polyfunctionality was associated with initial non-responders. By contrast, the single-cell transcriptomic data of unstimulated or TCR-activated CAR T cells failed to predict clinical responses. In aggregate, our results dissect the landscape of CAR-specific activation states in infusion products that can identify patients who do not develop a durable response to the therapy, and unveil the molecular mechanisms that may inform strategies to boost specific T cell function to maintain long term remission.",

    "abstract": "Under starvation conditions, bacteria tend to slow down their translation rate by reducing rRNA synthesis, but the way they accomplish that may vary in different bacteria. In Mycobacterium species, transcription of rRNA is activated by the RNA polymerase (RNAP) accessory transcription factor CarD, which interacts directly with RNAP to stabilize the RNAP-promoter open complex formed on rRNA genes. The functions of CarD have been extensively studied, but the mechanisms that control its expression remain obscure. Here, we report that the level of CarD was tightly regulated when mycobacterial cells switched from nutrient-rich to nutrient-deprived conditions. At the translational level, an antisense RNA of carD (AscarD) was induced in a SigF-dependent manner to bind with carD mRNA and inhibit CarD translation, while at the post-translational level, the residual intracellular CarD was quickly degraded by the Clp protease. AscarD thus worked synergistically with Clp protease to decrease the CarD level to help mycobacterial cells cope with the nutritional stress. Altogether, our work elucidates the regulation mode of CarD and delineates a new mechanism for the mycobacterial starvation response, which is important for the adaptation and persistence of mycobacterial pathogens in the host environment.",

In this article, a operational taxonomic units(OTU)-specific (family-specific) and time-specific joint model is presented as a tool to model the association between OTU (or family) and biological response (measured by IgA level) taking into account the treatment group (Control or PAT) of the subjects. The model allows detecting OTUs (families) that are associated with the IgA; for some OTUs (families), the association is driven by the treatment while for others the association reflects the correlation between the OTUs (families) and IgA.The results of the analysis reveal that: (1) the observed diversity of S24-7 family can be used as a biomarker to classify samples according to treatment group for days 6 and 12; (2) the treatment effect induces the corrlelation between the S24-7 diversity and the IgA level at day 20; (3) The OTUs that are identified to be significantly differentially abundant (FDR level of 0.05) between the two treatment groups for days 12 and 20 are all part of the S24-7 family, although most of the differentially abundant ones at day 1 are from the Lactobacillaceae family; (4) only the Lachnospiraceae family diversity at day 6, and 20 can be used as predictive biomarker for the IgA level at day 20; (5) New.ReferenceOTU513, correlated with the IgA level at day 20, since day 12, belongs to the Lachnospiraceae family and all other OTUs among the top 10 significantly associated OTUs at day 20 are from the S24-7 family; (6) the observed alpha diversity at day 6 is significantly differentially abundant and can be used as predictive biomarker for IgA level at day 20.",

The loss of the SUZ12 N-terminus in the fusion protein disrupted interaction with the PRC2 accessory factors JARID2, EPOP and PALI1 and prevented recruitment of PRC2 from RNA to chromatin. In undifferentiated cells, JAZF1-SUZ12 occupied PRC2 target genes but gained a JAZF1-like binding profile during cell differentiation. JAZF1-SUZ12 reduced H3K27me3 and increased H4Kac at PRC2 target genes, and this was associated with disruption in gene expression and cell differentiation programs. These results reveal the defects in chromatin regulation caused by JAZF1-SUZ12, which may underlie its role in oncogenesis.",

    "abstract": "Many genes have nycthemeral rhythms of expression, i.e. a 24-hours periodic variation, at either mRNA or protein level or both, and, most rhythmic genes are tissue-specific. Here, we investigate and discuss the evolutionary origins of rhythms in gene expression. Our results suggest that thythmicity of protein expression has been favored by selection for low cost. Trends are consistent in bacteria, plants and animals, and are also supported in tissue-specific patterns in mouse. Cost cannot explain rhythm at the RNA level, and we suggest instead it allows to periodically and drastically reduce expression noise. Noise control had strongest support in mouse, with limited power in other species. Genes under stronger purifying selection are rhythmically expressed at the mRNA level, probably because they are noise sensitive genes. We also suggest that mRNA rhythmicity allows to switch between optimal precision and higher stochasticity. Higher precision allows to maximize the robustness of gene expression when the function is most needed, while higher stochasticity allows to maintain oscillations and to exhibit diverse molecular phenotypes, i.e. \"blind anticipation\" of cells. The ability to alternate between these two states, enabled by rhythmicity at the mRNA level, might be adaptive in fluctuating environments. Finally, the adaptive role of rhythmic expression is also supported by rhythmic genes being highly expressed yet tissue-specific genes. This provides a good evolutionary explanation for the observation that nycthemeral rhythms are often tissue-specific.",

    "abstract": "Native American genetic ancestry has been remarkably implicated with increased risk of diverse health issues in several Mexican populations, especially in relation to the dramatic changes in environmental, dietary and cultural settings they have recently undergone. In particular, the effects of these ecological transitions and Westernization of lifestyles have been investigated so far predominantly on Admixed individuals. Nevertheless, indigenous groups, rather than admixed Mexicans, have plausibly retained the highest proportions of genetic components shaped by natural selection in response to the ancient milieu experienced by Mexican ancestors during their pre-Columbian evolutionary history. These formerly adaptive alleles/haplotypes have the potential to represent the genetic determinants of some biological traits peculiar to the Mexican people and a reservoir of loci with potential biomedical relevance. To test such a hypothesis, we used high-resolution genomic data to infer the unique adaptive evolution of 15 Native Mexican groups selected as reasonable descendants of the main pre-Columbian Mexican civilizations. A combination of haplotype-based and gene-network analyses enabled us to detect genomic signatures ascribable to polygenic adaptive traits evolved by the main genetic clusters of indigenous Mexican populations to cope with local environmental and/or cultural conditions. Some of them were also found to play a role in modulating the susceptibility/resistance of these groups to certain pathological conditions, thus providing new evidence for diverse selective pressures having contributed to shape current biological and disease-risk patterns in present-day Native and Mestizo Mexican populations.",

    "abstract": "Recent studies have identified numerous RNAs that are functionally both coding and noncoding. However, the sequence characteristics that determine bifunctionality remain largely unknown. In this study, we developed and tested a potentially translated island (PTI) score, defined as the occupancy of the longest open reading frame (ORF) among all putative ORFs. We found that this score correlated with translation, including noncoding RNAs. In bacteria and archaea, coding and noncoding transcripts had narrow distributions of high and low PTI scores, respectively, whereas those of eukaryotes showed relatively broader distributions, with considerable overlap between coding and noncoding transcripts. The extent of overlap positively and negatively correlated with the mutation rates of genomes and effective population sizes of species, respectively. These overlaps were significantly increased in threatened species. In macroevolution, the appearance of the nucleus and multicellularity seem to have influenced the overlap of PTI score distributions, so that the probability of the existence of bifunctional RNAs is increased in eukaryotes. In mammalian testes, we observed an enrichment of noncoding RNAs with high PTI scores, which are candidates for bifunctional RNAs. These results suggest that the decrease in population size and the emergence of testes in eukaryotic multicellular organisms allow for the stable existence of bifunctional RNAs, consequently increasing the probability of the birth of novel coding and non-coding RNAs.",

    "abstract": "Development and progression of myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) are difficult to predict. Identification at a young age of dogs with a morphotype associated with more severe mitral disease is desirable. The aims of this study were to: 1) describe the physical, morphometric, and echocardiographic features of MMVD affected Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS) in American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (ACVIM) class B1; 2) evaluate the influence of morphometric physical measurements on murmur intensity, mitral valve prolapse (MVP), regurgitant jet size and indexed mitral valve and annulus measurements. Fifty-two MMVD affected CKCS in ACVIM class B1 were included. This is a prospective clinical cross-sectional study. Morphometric measurements, which included body, thorax, and the head sizing of each dog, have been investigated to establish the association with heart murmur intensity, valvular and annular echocardiographic measurements, MVP and regurgitant jet size using inverse probability weighting (IPW) analyses to adjust for confounding. The IPW analyses showed that when head length and nose length decreased, dogs had more severe regurgitant jet size. Furthermore, subjects with more pronounced head stop angle had thicker anterior mitral valve leaflets. A brachycephalic morphotype, with dogs more similar to King Charles Spaniel breed in cephalic morphology, is associated with a more severe regurgitant jet size and with valvular characteristics related to worse forms of MMVD.",

    "abstract": "Simulation of large-scale networks of neurons is an important approach to understanding and interpreting experimental data from healthy and diseased brains. Owing to the rapid development of simulation software and the accumulation of quantitative data of different neuronal types, it is possible to predict both computational and dynamical properties of local microcircuits in a  bottom-up manner. Simulated data from these models can be compared with experiments and  top-down modelling approaches, successively bridging the scales. Here we describe an open source pipeline, using the software Snudda, for predicting microcircuit connectivity and for setting up simulations using the NEURON simulation environment in a reproducible way. We also illustrate how to further  curate data on single neuron morphologies acquired from public databases. This model building pipeline was used to set up a first version of a full-scale cellular level model of mouse dorsal striatum. Model components from that work are here used to illustrate the different steps that are needed when modelling subcortical nuclei, such as the basal ganglia.",

    "abstract": "BackgroundEfficient interhemispheric integration of neural activity between left and right primary motor cortex (M1) is critical for inter-limb motor control.\n\nObjectiveWe employed optogenetic stimulation to establish a framework for probing transcallosal M1-M1 interactions in rats.\n\nMethodsIn male rats, we optogenetically stimulated glutamatergic neurons in right M1 and recorded the transcallosally evoked potential with chronically implanted electrodes in contralateral left M1 during dexmedetomidine anesthesia. We systematically varied the stimulation intensity and duration to characterize the relationship between stimulation parameters in right M1 and the characteristics of the evoked intracortical potentials in left M1.\n\nResultsOptogenetic stimulation of right M1 consistently evoked a transcallosal response in left M1 with a consistent negative peak (N1) that sometimes was preceded by a smaller positive peak (P1). Higher stimulation intensity or longer stimulation duration gradually increased N1 amplitude and reduced N1 variability across trials. Median N1 latencies remained stable, once stimulation elicited a reliable N1 peak and did not display a systematic shortening with increasing stimulation intensity or duration.\n\nConclusionsOptogenetically stimulated glutamatergic neurons in M1 can reliably evoke a transcallosal response in anesthetized rats and can be used to characterize the relationship between \"stimulation dose\" and \"response magnitude\" (i.e., the gain function) of transcallosal M1-to-M1 glutamatergic connections. Detailed knowledge of the stimulus-response relationship is needed to optimize the efficacy of optogenetic stimulation. Since transcallosal M1-M1 interactions can also be probed non-invasively with transcranial magnetic stimulation in humans, our optogenetic stimulation approach bears translational potential for studying how unilateral M1 stimulation can induce interhemispheric plasticity.",

    "abstract": "Associative learning allows animals to use past experience to predict future events. The circuits underlying memory formation support immediate and sustained changes in function, often in response to a single example. Larval Drosophila is a genetic model for memory formation that can be accessed at molecular, synaptic, cellular, and circuit levels, often simultaneously, but existing behavioral assays for larval learning and memory do not address individual animals, and it has been difficult to form long lasting memories, especially those requiring synaptic re-organization. We demonstrate a new assay for learning and memory capable of tracking the changing preferences of individual larvae. We use this assay to explore how activation of a pair of reward neurons changes the response to the innately aversive gas Carbon Dioxide (CO2). We confirm that when coupled to odor presentation in appropriate temporal sequence, optogenetic reward reduces avoidance of CO2. We find that learning is switch-like: all-or-none and quantized in two states. Memories can be extinguished by repeated unrewarded exposure to CO2 but are stabilized against extinction by repeated training or overnight consolidation. Finally, we demonstrate long-lasting protein synthesis dependent and independent memory formation.",

    "abstract": "Previous studies have investigated the neural basis of action and emotion perception conveyed by whole body postures and movements. However, subjective understanding of other peoples bodily actions and emotions, raises different issues that are currently not well understood and have so far seldom been investigated. In this 7T fMRI study, we proceeded beyond conventional univariate/multivariate analyses with predefined categories, and examined the representational geometry of subjective action- and emotion-understanding by mapping individual subjective reports with word embeddings. Dimensionality reduction revealed that the representations for perceived action and emotion were high dimensional, each correlated to but were not reducible to the predefined action and emotion categories. Searchlight representational similarity analysis showed that the representations in the left middle superior temporal sulcus and left dorsal premotor cortex corresponded to the subjective action and emotion understanding of the participants. Furthermore, using task-residual functional connectivity and hierarchical clustering, we found that areas in the action observation network and the semantic/default-mode network were functionally connected to these two seed regions, and showed similar representations. Our study provides direct evidence that both networks were concurrently involved in subjective action and emotion understanding. Our approach shows how subjective understanding of action and emotion stimuli can be reliably studied and complement insights based on from predefined stimulus categories.",

    "abstract": "Repetitive activation of subpopulation of neurons in cortical networks leads to the formation of neuronal assemblies, which can guide learning and behavior. Recent technological advances have made the artificial induction of such assemblies feasible, yet how various patterns of activation can shape their emergence in different operating regimes is not clear. Here we studied this question in large-scale cortical networks composed of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons. We found that the dynamics of the network in which neuronal assemblies are embedded is important for their induction. In networks with strong E-E coupling at the border of E-I balance, increasing the number of perturbed neurons enhanced the potentiation of ensembles. This was, however, accompanied by off-target potentiation of connections from unperturbed neurons. When strong E-E connectivity was combined with dominant E-I interactions, formation of ensembles became specific. Counter-intuitively, increasing the number of perturbed neurons in this regime decreased the average potentiation of individual synapses, leading to an optimal assembly formation at intermediate sizes. This was due to potent lateral inhibition in this regime, which also slowed down the formation of neuronal assemblies, resulting in a speed-accuracy trade-off in the performance of the networks in pattern completion and behavioral discrimination. Our results therefore suggest that the two regimes might be suited for different cognitive tasks, with fast regimes enabling crude detections and slow but specific regimes favoring finer discriminations. Functional connectivity inferred from recent experiments in mouse cortical networks seems to be consistent with the latter regime, but we show that recurrent and top-down mechanisms can dynamically modulate the networks to switch between different states. Our work provides a framework to study how neuronal perturbations can lead to network-wide plasticity under biologically realistic conditions, and sheds light on the design of future experiments to optimally induce behaviorally relevant neuronal assemblies.",

    "abstract": "Functional imaging and behavioural studies have shown that the neuropeptide oxytocin influences processing of emotional faces. However, it is not clear whether these effects reflect modulation at an early or late stage of affective processing. We investigated the effects of oxytocin administration on early and late visual evoked potentials (VEP) in response to faces with neutral, fearful and happy expressions. In addition, we measured multifocal VEP and its associated nonlinearities to ascertain whether any changes observed in electrophysiology were indicative of a generalised effect or of one tied strictly to emotional processing. In a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design, 27 healthy male participants self-administered a nasal spray of either oxytocin (24 IU) or placebo. At very early latencies (40-60ms), oxytocin reduced right-temporal responses to fearful faces (d = .51), and central responses to both fearful (d = .48) and neutral faces (d = .54). For left occipito-temporal electrode sites, oxytocin decreased P100 reactivity to fearful expressions (d = 0.72). Oxytocin also decreased the amplitudes of the vertex positive potential (140-180ms) and late positive potential (400-600ms), regardless of whether the faces had fearful, happy or neutral expressions. The mfVEP showed no signs of selective magno-or parvo-cellular peak modulation comparing OXT with placebo with either low or high contrast stimulation. These results suggest that at early stages of visual processing, nasal oxytocin modulates responses to facial emotions, whereas at later stages of visual processing, it appears to influence more general face processing mechanisms. In addition, the measurable effects of OXT appear to be not a result of generalized brain change, but systematically related to emotional processing.",

This study is the first to report the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) for the detection of Saprolegnia spp. and compares it with quantitative PCR (qPCR). The developed protocols targeted the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA and the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (CoxI) gene and was shown to be specific only to Saprolegnia genus. This LAMP method can detect as low as 10 fg of S. salmonis DNA while the qPCR method has a detection limit of 2 pg of S. salmonis DNA, indicating the superior sensitivity of LAMP compared to qPCR. When applied to detect the pathogen in water samples, both methods could detect the pathogen when only one zoospore of Saprolegnia was present. We propose LAMP as a quick (about 20-60 minutes) and sensitive molecular diagnostic tool for the detection of Saprolegnia spp. suitable for on-site applications.",

In this study, we aimed to clarify the importance of MTA1 in tube formation using MTA1-knockout endothelial cells (MTA1-KO MSS31 cells). Tube formation was strongly suppressed in MTA1-KO MSS31 cells, whereas MTA1-overexpressed MTA1-KO MSS31 cells regained the ability to form tube-like structures. Furthermore, MTA1-KO MSS31 cells showed higher phosphorylation of non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIa (NMIIa), which resulted in suppression of tube formation; this was attributed to a decrease of MTA1- S100 calcium-binding protein A4 (S100A4) complex formation. Moreover, inhibition of tube formation in MTA1-KO MSS31 cells could not be rescued by stimulation with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). These results demonstrated that MTA1 is an essential molecule for angiogenesis, and that it may be involved in different steps of the angiogenic process compared to the VEGF-VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway. Our findings showed that endothelial MTA1 and its pathway are promising targets for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis, supporting the development of MTA1-based anti-angiogenic therapies.",

To this end, toxicokinetic (TK) data are particularly useful to relate the chemical exposure concentration to the accumulation and depuration processes happening within organisms. The bioaccumulative property of substances is quantified by bioaccumulation metrics obtained by fitting TK models to data collected from bioaccumulation tests. The internal concentrations of the studied substances are measured within organisms at regular time points during both accumulation and depuration phases, and their time course is captured by TK models thus providing bioaccumulation metrics. Still today, raw TK data remain difficult to access, as most of the time provided within papers in plots only.

    "abstract": "Animal agriculture contributes significantly to global warming through ongoing emissions of the potent greenhouse gases methane and nitrous oxide, and displacement of biomass carbon on the land used to support livestock. However, because estimates of the magnitude of the effect of ending animal agriculture often focus on only one factor, the full potential benefit of a more radical change remains underappreciated. Here we quantify the full \"climate opportunity cost\" of current global livestock production, by modeling the combined, long-term effects of emission reductions and biomass recovery that would be unlocked by a phaseout of animal agriculture. We show that, even in the absence of any other emission reductions, persistent drops in atmospheric methane and nitrous oxide levels, and slower carbon dioxide accumulation, following a phaseout of livestock production would, through the end of the century, have the same cumulative effect on the warming potential of the atmosphere as a 25 gigaton per year reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions, providing half of the net emission reductions necessary to limit warming to 2{degrees}C. The magnitude and rapidity of these potential effects should place the reduction or elimination of animal agriculture at the forefront of strategies for averting disastrous climate change.\n\nSignificance StatementThe use of animals to produce food has a negative impact on the climate, but the benefits of a global switch to a plant based diet are underappreciated. We show that the global warming impact, through the rest of this century, of eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from livestock and allowing native ecosystems to regrow on the land currently used to house and feed livestock, would be equivalent to a 68% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. We hope putting clearer numbers on the \"climate opportunity cost\" of our continued use of animals as food technology will help policymakers and the public properly prioritize dietary change as a climate defense strategy.\n\nDeclaration of Conflict of InterestPatrick Brown is the founder and CEO of Impossible Foods, a company developing alternatives to animals in food-production.

While this strategy is theorized to be optimal when pollinators are abundant, it might represent a risk when they become scarce, because the disproportionately high number of visits on the most attractive sex, males, might preclude efficient pollen transfer from males to females. Here, the effect of sexual dimorphism on pollination efficiency was assessed in experimental arrays of dioecious Silene dioica that were exposed to one frequent visitor of the species, Bombus terrestris, and that differed in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism for either flower number or flower size. While flower size dimorphism did not impact pollination efficiency, we found that flower number dimorphism negatively affected the number of visits on female plants, on female flowers and on the number of female flowers visited after a male flower. However, flower number dimorphism had no effect on the number of pollen grains deposited per stigma, presumably because the decrease in the number of visits to female flowers was compensated by a higher number of pollen grains deposited per visit.",

    "abstract": "The respiratory release of CO2 by microbes is a dominant component of the global carbon cycle. However, large uncertainties exist about the effects of climatic warming on the respiration of microbial communities due to lack of mechanistic, empirically-tested theory that accounts for dynamic species interactions. We developed a general mathematical model which predicts that thermal sensitivity of microbial community respiration increases as species interactions become more positive, i.e., change from competition to facilitation. This is because facilitation disproportionately increases positive feedbacks between the thermal sensitivities of species-level metabolic and biomass accumulation rates at warmer temperatures. We experimentally validated this prediction in bacterial communities of 8 taxa, finding that a shift from competition to facilitation after a month of co-adaptation caused a 60% increase in the thermal sensitivity of their respiration relative to de novo communities that had not co-adapted. Thus, rapid changes in species interactions can profoundly change the temperature-dependence of microbial community respiration and should be considered in climate change models.",

    "abstract": "Urbanisation is a major anthropogenic perturbation that progressively alters multiple environmental parameters, thereby presenting novel evolutionary challenges to wild populations. Symbiotic microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tracts (gut) of vertebrates have well-established mutual connections with the physiology of their hosts and respond quickly to environmental alterations. However, the impacts of anthropogenic changes and urbanisation on gut microbiota remain poorly understood, especially in early development. To address this knowledge gap, we investigated the gut microbiota in juvenile great tits (Parus major) in an urban mosaic. First, we compared the microbiota of nestlings reared in artificial nest boxes or natural cavities. Next, we analysed microbiota variations employing two distinct urbanisation frameworks, (i) the classical urban/rural dichotomy and (ii) gradual changes in the amount of impervious surface area (ISA) in the urban space and identified the environmental variables that predicted the changes in the microbial communities. Alpha diversity was influenced by cavity type and by the amount of impervious surface surrounding the breeding location. Alpha diversity was also positively correlated with the tree cover density. Beta diversity differed between urban and rural sites, and these alterations covaried with sound pollution, the distance to the city centre and the distance to the closest road. Overall, the microbial communities reflect and are possibly influenced by the heterogeneous environmental modifications that are typical of the urban space. Strikingly, the choice of framework used to define the urban space can influence the outcomes of studies investigating animal-microbe symbiosis. Our results open new perspectives from which the potential function of microbial symbionts in the adaptation of their hosts to anthropogenic stress can be investigated.",

    "abstract": "AO_SCPLOWBSTRACTC_SCPLOWThe diversity of mating and sexual systems in angiosperms is spectacular, but the factors driving their evolution remain poorly understood. In plants of the Oleaceae family, an unusual self-incompatibility (SI) system has been discovered recently, whereby only two distinct homomorphic SI specificities segregate stably. To understand the role of this peculiar SI system in preventing or promoting the diversity of sexual phenotypes observed across the family, an essential first step is to characterize the genetic architecture of these two traits. Here, we developed a high-density genetic map of the androdioecious shrub P. angustifolia based on a F1 cross between a hermaphrodite and a male parent with distinct SI genotypes. Using a double restriction-site associated digestion (ddRAD) sequencing approach, we obtained reliable genotypes for 196 offspring and their two parents at 10,388 markers. The resulting map comprises 23 linkage groups totaling 1,855.13 cM on the sex-averaged map. We found strong signals of association for the sex and SI phenotypes, that were each associated with a unique set of markers on linkage group 12 and 18 respectively, demonstrating inheritance of these traits as single, independent, mendelian factors. The P. angustifolia linkage map shows robust synteny to the olive tree genome overall. Two of the six markers strictly associated with SI in P. angustifolia have strong similarity with a recently identified 741kb chromosomal region fully linked to the SI phenotype on chromosome 18 of the olive tree genome, providing strong cross-validation support. The SI locus stands out as being markedly rearranged, while the sex locus has remained relatively more collinear between the two species. This P. angustifolia linkage map will be a useful resource to investigate the various ways by which the sex and SI determination systems have co-evolved in the broader phylogenetic context of the Oleaceae family.",

    "abstract": "Polygenic risk scores derived from genotype data (PRS) and family history of disease (FH) both provide valuable information for predicting disease risk, enhancing prospects for clinical utility. PRS perform poorly when applied to diverse populations, but FH does not suffer this limitation. Here, we explore methods for combining both types of information (PRS-FH). We analyzed 10 complex diseases from the UK Biobank for which family history (parental and sibling history) was available for most target samples. PRS were trained using all British individuals (N=409K), and target samples consisted of unrelated non-British Europeans (N=42K), South Asians (N=7K), or Africans (N=7K). We evaluated PRS, FH, and PRS-FH using liability-scale R2, focusing on three well-powered diseases (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, depression) with R2 > 0.05 for PRS and/or FH in each target population. Averaging across these three diseases, PRS attained average prediction R2 of 5.8%, 4.0%, and 0.53% in non-British Europeans, South Asians, and Africans, confirming poor cross-population transferability. In contrast, PRS-FH attained average prediction R2 of 13%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, representing a large improvement in Europeans and an extremely large improvement in Africans; for each disease and each target population, the improvement was highly statistically significant. PRS-FH methods based on a logistic model and a liability threshold model performed similarly when covariates were not included in predictions (consistent with simulations), but the logistic model outperformed the liability threshold model when covariates were included. In conclusion, including family history greatly improves the accuracy of polygenic risk scores, particularly in diverse populations.",

    "abstract": "In Drosophila, expression of eyeless (ey) gene is restricted to the developing eyes and central nervous system. However, the flanking genes, myoglianin (myo), and bent (bt) have different temporal and spatial expression patterns as compared to the ey. How distinct regulation of ey is maintained is mostly unknown. Earlier, we have identified a boundary element intervening myo and ey genes (ME boundary) that prevents the crosstalk between the cis-regulatory elements of myo and ey genes. In the present study, we further searched for the cis-elements that define the domain of ey and maintain its expression pattern. We identify another boundary element between ey and bt, the EB boundary. The EB boundary separates the regulatory landscapes of ey and bt genes. The two boundaries, ME and EB, show a long-range interaction as well as interact with the nuclear architecture. This suggests functional autonomy of the ey locus and its insulation from differentially regulated flanking regions. We also identify a new Polycomb Response Element, the ey-PRE, within the ey domain. The expression state of the ey gene, once established during early development is likely to be maintained with the help of ey- PRE. Our study proposes a general regulatory mechanism by which a gene can be maintained in a functionally independent chromatin domain in gene-rich euchromatin.",

    "abstract": "Traits with a complex unknown genetic architecture are common in breeding programs. However, they pose a challenge for selection due to a combination of complex environmental and pleiotropic effects that impede the ability to create mapping populations to characterize the traits genetic basis. One such trait, seedling emergence of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from deep planting, presents a unique opportunity to explore the best method to use and implement GS models to predict a complex trait. 17 GS models were compared using two training populations, consisting of 473 genotypes from a diverse association mapping panel (DP) phenotyped from 2015-2019 and the other training population consisting of 643 breeding lines phenotyped in 2015 and 2020 in Lind, WA with 40,368 markers. There were only a few significant differences between GS models, with support vector machines reaching the highest accuracy of 0.56 in a single breeding line trial using cross-validations. However, the consistent moderate accuracy of cBLUP and other parametric models indicates no need to implement computationally demanding non-parametric models for complex traits. There was an increase in accuracy using cross-validations from 0.40 to 0.41 and independent validations from 0.10 to 0.17 using diversity panels lines to breeding lines. The environmental effects of complex traits can be overcome by combining years of the same populations. Overall, our study showed that breeders can accurately predict and implement GS for a complex trait by using parametric models within their own breeding programs with increased accuracy as they combine training populations over the years.",

Available approaches for engineering targeted technologies for new neuron subtypes are low-yield, involving intensive transgenic strain or virus screening. Here, we introduce SNAIL (Specific Nuclear-Anchored Independent Labeling), a new virus-based strategy for cell labeling and nuclear isolation from heterogeneous tissue. SNAIL works by leveraging machine learning and other computational approaches to identify DNA sequence features that confer cell type-specific gene activation and using them to make a probe that drives an affinity purification-compatible reporter gene. As a proof of concept, we designed and validated two novel SNAIL probes that target parvalbumin-expressing (PV) neurons. Furthermore, we show that nuclear isolation using SNAIL in wild type mice is sufficient to capture characteristic open chromatin features of PV neurons in the cortex, striatum, and external globus pallidus. Expansion of this technology has broad applications in cell type-specific observation, manipulation, and therapeutics across species and disease models.",

Comparative analyses of published ancient sequences revealed remarkable DNA integrity of this mummy. Hallmarks of postmortem damage, fragmentation and hydrolytic deamination, are substantially reduced, likely due to the high-salinity of this taphonomic environment. Metagenomic analyses reflect the profound influence of high salt content on decomposition; its microbial profile is predominated by halophilic archaea and bacteria, possibly contributing to the preservation of this sample. Applying population genomic analyses we find consistent clustering of this sheep with Southwest Asian modern breeds, suggesting ancestry continuity.

Cell encapsulated hydrogels composed of materials such as gelatin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, alginate and polyethylene glycol have been widely used as bioinks for 3D bioprinting. However, since most hydrogel-based bioinks may not allow rapid stabilization immediately after 3D bioprinting, achieving high resolution and fidelity to the intended architecture is a common challenge in 3D bioprinting of hydrogels. In this study, we have utilized shear-thinning and self-healing ionically crosslinked oxidized and methacrylated alginates (OMAs) as a bioink, which can be rapidly gelled by its self-healing property after bioprinting and further stabilized via secondary crosslinking. It was successfully demonstrated that stem cell-laden calcium-crosslinked OMA hydrogels can be bioprinted into complicated 3D tissue structures with both high resolution and fidelity. Additional photocrosslinking enables long-term culture of 3D bioprinted constructs for formation of functional tissue by differentiation of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells.",

    "abstract": "The flood mosquito, Aedes vexans (Diptera: Culicidae), native of Canada, and currently present in all continents, has a vector competence for 30 arboviruses, being responsible for transmitting diseases, like West Nile fever, Rift Valley fever, Saint Louis Encephalitis and Eastern Equine Encephalitis. Hence, knowing the structure and gene flow of A. vexans is important to develop adequate vector control strategies for this species. For this, from partial sequences of the mitochondrial COI gene available in Bold and GenBank, it was possible to determine the Haplotypic (Hd) and nucleotide ({pi}) gene diversity, genetic structuring and gene flow at global, continental, and country levels. In total, 1184 sequences were recovered, distributed between America (88.60%), Europe (7.35%), Asia (3.89%), and Africa (0.17%). From these, 395 haplotypes (H) were detected without presence of pseudogenes (NUMTs), with H1 being the most frequent (24.58%) and between H12 - H395 the least frequent varying between 0.93% (H12) and 0.08% (H395). Phylogenetically, the haplotypes were grouped into six clades. Clade I grouped haplotypes from countries in America and Europe, while clades II and III presented haplotypes exclusively from Asia and Europe; clade IV grouped only one haplotype from Africa and the last ultimo clade V grouped haplotypes from America and Africa. The global Hd and {pi} was 0.92 and 0.01, respectively. In addition, evidence was obtained of genetic structuring among continents (7.07%), countries (1.62%), and within countries (91.30%; FST = 0.08, p < 0.05) and no isolation by distance was detected (r = 0.003, p > 0.05). These results suggest that the mosquito populations that invaded other continents originate directly from the American continent, where possibly transcontinental commercial routes favored their long-distance dispersion.",

However, an exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally unfeasible, so computational methods are needed to predict, interpret, and prioritize perturbations. Here, we present the compositional perturbation autoencoder (CPA), which combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility of deep-learning approaches for single-cell response modeling. CPA encodes and learns transcriptional drug responses across different cell type, dose, and drug combinations. The model produces easy-to-interpret embeddings for drugs and cell types, which enables drug similarity analysis and predictions for unseen dosage and drug combinations. We show that CPA accurately models single-cell perturbations across compounds, doses, species, and time. We further demonstrate that CPA predicts combinatorial genetic interactions of several types, implying that it captures features that distinguish different interaction programs. Finally, we demonstrate that CPA can generate in-silico 5,329 missing genetic combination perturbations (97.6% of all possibilities) with diverse genetic interactions. We envision our model will facilitate efficient experimental design and hypothesis generation by enabling in-silico response prediction at the single-cell level, and thus accelerate therapeutic applications using single-cell technologies.",

    "abstract": "MotivationDrug repositioning is an attractive alternative to de novo drug discovery due to reduced time and costs to bring drugs to market. Computational repositioning methods, particularly non-black-box methods that can account for and predict a drugs mechanism, may provide great benefit for directing future development. By tuning both data and algorithm to utilize relationships important to drug mechanisms, a computational repositioning algorithm can be trained to both predict and explain mechanistically novel indications.\n\nResultsIn this work, we examined the 123 curated drug mechanism paths found in the drug mechanism database (DrugMechDB) and after identifying the most important relationships, we integrated 18 data sources to produce a heterogeneous knowledge graph, MechRepoNet, capable of capturing the information in these paths. We applied the Rephetio repurposing algorithm to MechRepoNet using only a subset of relationships known to be mechanistic in nature and found adequate predictive ability on an evaluation set with AUROC value of 0.83. The resulting repurposing model allowed us to prioritize paths in our knowledge graph to produce a predicted treatment mechanism. We found that DrugMechDB paths, when present in the network were rated highly among predicted mechanisms. We then demonstrated MechRepoNets ability to use mechanistic insight to identify a drugs mechanistic target, with a mean reciprocal rank of .525 on a test set of known drug-target interactions. Finally, we walked through a repurposing example of the anti-cancer drug imantinib for use in the treatment of asthma, to demonstrate this methods utility in providing mechanistic insight into repurposing predictions it provides.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe Python code to reproduce the entirety of this analysis is available at: https://github.com/SuLab/MechRepoNet\n\nContactasu@scripps.edu\n\nSupplementary informationSupplemental information is available at Bioinformatics online.",

    "abstract": "Identifying essential genes on a genome scale is resource intensive and has been performed for only a few eukaryotes. For less studied organisms essentiality might be predicted by gene homology. However, this approach cannot be applied to non-conserved genes. Additionally, divergent essentiality information is obtained from studying single cells or whole, multi-cellular organisms, and particularly when derived from human cell line screens and human population studies. We employed machine learning across six model eukaryotes and 60,381 genes, using 41,635 features derived from sequence, gene functions and network topology. Within a leave-one-organism-out cross-validation, the classifiers showed a high generalizability with an average accuracy close to 80% in the left-out species. As a case study, we applied the method to Tribolium castaneum and validated predictions experimentally yielding similar performance. Finally, using the classifier based on the studied model organisms enabled linking the essentiality information of human cell line screens and population studies.",

    "abstract": "The ribosome is a fundamental biomolecular complex responsible for protein production in cells. Nascent proteins emerge from the ribosome through a tunnel, where they may interact with the tunnel walls or small molecules such as antibiotics. These interactions can cause translational arrest with notable physiologic consequences. Here, we studied the arrest caused by the regulatory peptide VemP, which is known to form an -helix in the ribosome tunnel near the peptidyl transferase center under specific conditions. We used all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the entire ribosome and circular dichroism spectroscopy to study the driving forces of helix formation and how VemP causes the translational arrest. To that aim, we compared VemP dynamics in the ribosome tunnel with its dynamics in solution. We show that the VemP sequence has a low helical propensity in water and that the propensity is higher in more hydrophobic solvents. We propose that helix formation within the ribosome is driven by the tunnel environment and that a portion of VemP acts as an anchor. This anchor might slow down VemP progression through the tunnel enabling the -helix formation, which causes the elongation arrest.",

Combination drug regimens have shown promise as a method to overcome resistance; however, to date only some cancers have been cured with this method. Collateral sensitivity - the phenomenon whereby resistance to one drug is co-occurrent with sensitivity to a second drug - has been gaining traction as a promising new concept to guide rational design of combination regimens. Here we survey collateral responses to acquisition of resistance to four classical chemotherapy agents. Although collateral sensitivities have been documented for antibiotics and targeted cancer therapies, we did not observe collateral sensitivities to any of the cytotoxic agents we studied. Interestingly, we did observe heterogeneity in the phenotypic response to acquisition of resistance to each drug, suggesting the existence of multiple different states of resistance for each drug. Surprisingly, this phenotypic heterogeneity was unrelated to transcriptomic heterogeneity in the resistant cell lines. These features of phenotypic and transcriptomic heterogeneity must be taken into account in future studies of treated tumor subclones and in design of chemotherapy combinations.",

Activation of the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPRER) includes changes in protein translation and membrane lipid synthesis. Using stable isotope labeling, a \"signature\" of the UPRER in vivo in mouse liver was developed by inducing ER stress and measuring rates of both proteome-wide translation and de novo lipogenesis. Several changes in protein synthesis across ontologies were noted with age, including a more dramatic suppression of translation under ER stress in aged mice as compared to young mice. Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) synthesis rates and mRNA levels were increased more in aged than young mice. De novo lipogenesis rates decreased under ER stress conditions in aged mice, including both triglyceride and phospholipid fractions. In young mice, only a significant reduction was seen in the triglyceride fraction. These data indicate that aged mice have an exaggerated response to ER stress, which may indicate that the aging renders the UPRER less effective in resolving proteotoxic stress.",

    "abstract": "Excessive sodium intake is known to increase the risk for hypertension, heart disease, and stroke. Individuals who are more susceptible to the effects of high salt are at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases even independent of their blood pressure status. Local activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the brain, among other mechanisms, has been hypothesized to play a key role in contributing to salt balance. We have previously shown that deletion of the alternative renin isoform termed renin-b disinhibits the classical renin-a encoding preprorenin in the brain resulting in elevated brain RAS activity. Thus, we hypothesized that renin-b deficiency results in higher susceptibility to salt-induced elevation in blood pressure. Telemetry implanted Ren-bNull and wildtype littermate mice were first offered a low salt diet for a week and subsequently a high salt diet for another week. A high salt diet induced a mild blood pressure elevation in both Ren-bNull and wildtype mice, but mice lacking renin-b did not exhibit an exaggerated pressor response. When renin-b deficient mice were exposed to a high salt diet for a longer duration (4 weeks), was a trend for increased myocardial enlargement in Ren-bNull mice when compared with control mice. Multiple studies have also demonstrated the association of chronic and acute environmental stress with hypertension. Activation of the RAS in the rostral ventrolateral medulla and the hypothalamus is required for stress-induced hypertension. Thus, we next questioned whether the lack of renin-b would result in exacerbated response to an acute restraint-stress. Wildtype and Ren-bNull mice equally exhibited elevated blood pressure in response to restraint-stress, which was similar in mice fed either a low or high salt diet. These studies highlight a complex mechanism that masks/unmasks roles for renin-b in cardiovascular physiology.",

    "abstract": "The Red Mangrove (Rhizophora mangle) is typically rooted in anoxic mud conditions that require special adaptations for root oxygenation. Each plant has multiple \"stilt roots\" that descend from upper branches and end in roots buried the mud. In cross section each stilt root consists of a core of porous aerenchyma surrounded by an impermeable layer of xylem, and outside the xylem there is a second layer aerenchyma. Oxygen must be provided to the mud roots through the aerenchyma either by diffusion or by gas flow, where the separate layers could provide up- and down-flow pathways. To test whether the stilt roots properties were consistent with gas flow, conductivities were measured. A technique was developed that measured flow conductivities in S.I. scientific units without using a flow meter and a calibrated pressure gauge. The core aerenchyma was more permeable to gas flow than any other plant tissue, except for those stems that are hollow tubes. Because there was little lateral leakage from the core aerenchyma, it had pipe-like properties. In the outer aerenchyma gas conductivity was high, and gas flowed easily through large lenticels on the surface of the stilt root. To complete the calculations, gas pressures in the stilt roots were measured. The calculated gas flow rates through mud roots was not sufficient to supply O2 for root respiration, suggesting that diffusion may be the more important mechanism for these plants.",

    "abstract": "Increasing CO2 levels are a major global challenge, and the extent to which increasing anthropogenic CO2 emissions can be mitigated by natural carbon sinks remains poorly understood. The uptake of elevated CO2 (eCO2) by the terrestrial biosphere, and subsequent sequestration as biomass in ecosystems, may act as a negative feedback in the carbon budget, but remains hard to quantify in natural ecosystems. Here, we combine large-scale field observations of fine root stocks and flows, derived from belowground imaging and soil cores, with image analysis, stochastic modelling, and statistical inference, to elucidate belowground root dynamics in a mature temperate deciduous forest under free-air CO2 enrichment to 150ppm above ambient levels. Using over 67k frames of belowground observation, we observe that eCO2 leads to relatively faster root production (a peak volume fold change of 4.52 {+/-} 0.44 eCO2 versus 2.58 {+/-} 0.21 control). We identify an increase in existing root elongation relative to root mass decay as the likely causal mechanism for this acceleration. Direct physical analysis of biomass and width measurements from 552 root systems recovered from soil cores support this picture, with lengths and widths of fine roots significantly increasing under eCO2. We use dynamic measurements to estimate fine root contributions to net primary productivity, finding an increase under eCO2, with an estimated mean annual 204 {+/-} 93 g dw m-2yr-1 eCO2 versus 140 {+/-} 60 g dw m-2 yr-1 control. We also quantify and discuss the uncertainties in such productivity measurements. This multi-faceted approach thus sheds quantitative light on the challenging characterisation of the eCO2 response of root biomass in mature temperate forests.",

    "abstract": "P. aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen that is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections. We have developed an updated genome-scale model (GEM) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 for systems-study of the pathogen. We used both automated and semi-manual approaches to reconstruct and curate the model. After an extensive literature research, we added organism-specific reactions (e.g., phenazine transport and redox metabolism, cofactor metabolism, carnitine metabolism, oxalate production, etc.) to the model. This effort led to a highly curated, three-compartment, and mass-and-charge balanced BiGG model of PA14 that contains 1509 genes, 1779 metabolic reactions and 1151 unique metabolites. The model (iSD1509) has the largest genome coverage of P. aeruginosa PA14 to date with 424 more genes than the previous model (iPau1129). It is also the most accurate with prediction accuracies as high as 92.4% (for gene essentiality) and 93.5% (for substrate utilization). The model simulates growth in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. It predicts the biosynthesis of the virulence factor phenazine as a process for the pathogen to grow in low-oxygen environment. Further, a mechanism for the overproduction of a drug susceptibility biomarker (gluconate) can be elucidated by the principles of optimal growth. Finally, the model also simulates drug activity potentiation and protection by fumarate and glyoxylate, respectively, and provides mechanistic explanations for these processes. Overall, iSD1509 can be utilized to decipher the metabolic mechanisms associated with virulence and antibiotic susceptibility of P. aeruginosa PA14 to aid in the development of effective intervention strategies.",

    "abstract": "Research on certain circuits in simple organisms, such as bacterial chemotaxis, has enabled the formulation of mathematical design principles, leading to ever more precise experimental tests, catalyzing quantitative understanding. It would be important to map these principles to the far more complex case of a vertebrate behavioral circuit. Here, we provide such a mapping for the midbrain dopamine system. Dopamine transmission plays a key role in learning, motivation, and movement, but its systems-level function is not fully understood. We develop a minimal mechanistic model of the dopamine circuit based on physiological and behavioral data, and show that it can be mapped mathematically to the bacterial chemotaxis circuit. Just as chemotaxis robustly climbs attractant gradients, the dopamine circuit performs  reward-taxis where the attractant is the expected value of reward. The reward-taxis mechanism is based on a circuit feature called fold-change detection, where the circuit outputs the temporal logarithmic derivative of expected reward. The model can explain the general matching law, in which the ratio of responses to concurrent rewards goes as the reward ratio to the power {beta}. It provides an accurate mechanistic value for {beta} as the average gain/baseline ratio of the dopaminergic neurons. Reward-taxis provides testable etiologies for specific dopamine-related disorders.",

    "abstract": "The shift in control from dorsomedial to dorsolateral striatum during skill and habit formation has been well established, but whether striatal subregions orchestrate this shift co-operatively or competitively remains unclear. Cortical inputs have also been implicated in the shift towards automaticity, but it is unknown if they mirror their downstream striatal targets across this transition. We addressed these questions using a five-step heterogeneous action sequencing task in rats that is optimally performed by automated chains of actions. By optimising automatic habitual responding, we discovered that loss of function in the dorsomedial striatum accelerated sequence acquisition. In contrast, loss of function in the dorsolateral striatum impeded acquisition of sequencing, demonstrating functional opposition within the striatum. Unexpectedly the medial prefrontal cortex was not involved, however the lateral orbitofrontal cortex was critical. These results shift current theories about striatal control of behavior to a model of competitive opposition, where the dorsomedial striatum acts in a gating role to inhibit dorsolateral-striatum driven behavior.",

We assessed how accurately the model incorporating saccade-related high-gamma modulations would localize the primary visual cortex defined by electrical stimulation.\n\nResultsThe whole-brain level dynamic atlas demonstrated transient high-gamma suppression in the striatal region before saccade onset and high-gamma augmentation subsequently involving the widespread posterior brain regions.

    "abstract": "Computational modelling has served as a powerful tool to advance our understanding of language processes by making theoretical ideas rigorously specified and testable (a form of \" open science\" for theory building). In reading research, one of the most influential computational modelling frameworks is the triangle model of reading that characterises the mappings between orthography, phonology and semantics. Currently, most instantiations of the triangle modelling framework start the processes from orthographic levels which abstract away visual processing. Moreover, without visual processing, most models do not provide an opportunity to investigate visual-related dyslexia. To bridge this crucial gap, the present study extended the existing triangle models by implementing an additional visual input. We trained the model to learn to read from visual input without pre-defined orthographic representations. The model was assessed by reading tasks in both intact and after damage (to mimic acquire alexias). The simulation results demonstrated that the model was able to name word and nonwords as well as make lexical decisions. Damage to the visual, phonological or semantic components of the model resulted in the expected reading impairments associated with pure alexia, phonological dyslexia, and surface dyslexia, respectively. The simulation results demonstrated for the first time that both typical and neurologically-impaired reading including both central and peripheral dyslexia could be addressed in this extended triangle model of reading. The findings are consistent with the primary systems account.",

    "abstract": "Cortical processing of binocular disparity is believed to begin in V1 where cells are sensitive to absolute disparity, followed by the extraction of relative disparity in higher visual areas. While much is known about the cortical distribution and spatial tuning of disparity-selective neurons, the relationship between their spatial and temporal properties is less well understood. Here, we use steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials and dynamic random dot stereograms to characterize the temporal dynamics of spatial mechanisms in human visual cortex that are primarily sensitive to either absolute or relative disparity. Stereograms alternated between disparate and non-disparate states at 2 Hz. By varying the spatial frequency content of the disparate fields from a planar surface to corrugated ones, we biased responses towards absolute vs. relative disparities. Reliable Components Analysis was used to derive two dominant sources from the 128 channel EEG records. The first component (RC1) was maximal over the occipital pole while the second component (RC2) was maximal over right lateral occipital electrodes. In RC1, first harmonic responses were sustained, tuned for corrugation frequency, and sensitive to the presence of disparity references, consistent with prior psychophysical sensitivity measurements. By contrast, the second harmonic, associated with transient processing, was not spatially tuned and was indifferent to references, consistent with it being generated by an absolute disparity mechanism. In RC2, the sustained response component showed similar tuning and sensitivity to references. However, sensitivity for absolute disparity dropped off, and transient signals were mainly driven by the lowest corrugation frequencies.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTSustained and transient mechanisms have been demonstrated across sensory systems and may reflect a common coding strategy. This strategy may be useful for the analysis of the form and duration of complex events in the case of sustained signals, and the onset and location of events in the case of transient signals. Here, we provide direct neural correlates of sustained and transient disparity mechanisms in human visual cortex. Early visual cortex is sensitive to both relative and absolute disparity, with the former being processed in a sustained fashion and the latter in a more transient fashion. Outside of early visual cortex, sustained relative disparity responses are readily measurable, but transient responses and responses to absolute disparity are not.",

    "abstract": "Substantial effort has gone into neuroimaging studies of neural mechanisms underlying addiction. Human studies of smoking typically either give monetary reward during an fMRI task or else allow subjects to smoke outside the scanner, after the session. This raises a fundamental issue of construct validity, as it is unclear whether the same neural mechanisms process decisions about nicotine that process decisions about money. To address this, we developed a novel MR-compatible nicotine vaping device, such that access to nicotine vapor could be controlled and monitored. We recruited heavy smokers to perform a gambling task with nicotine and monetary reward on separate days. This allowed a direct comparison between the neural mechanisms of choosing and receiving immediate drug vs. monetary reward. We found substantial differences in the neural mechanisms that underlie risky choices about money vs. drug reward, including a reversal of the well-known error effects in the medial prefrontal cortex.",

    "abstract": "Nociception, somatic discriminative aspects of pain, is represented in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), as is touch, but the separation and the interaction of the two modalities within S1 remain unclear. Here, we show the spatially-distinct tactile and nociceptive processing in the granular barrel field (BF) and the adjacent dysgranular region (Dys) in mouse S1. Simultaneous recording of the multiunit activity across subregions reveals that Dys responses are selective to noxious input whereas those of BF are to tactile input. At the single neuron level, nociceptive information is represented separately from the tactile information in Dys layer 2/3. In contrast, both modalities are converged in a layer 5 neuron in each region. Interestingly, the two modalities interfere with each other in both regions. We further demonstrate that Dys, but not BF, activity is critically involved in neuropathic pain and pain behavior, and thus provide evidence that Dys is a center specialized for nociception in S1.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionary origin of ribonucleic acid (RNA) stem structures and the preservation of their base-pairing under a spontaneous and random mutation process have puzzled theoretical evolutionary biologists. DNA replication-related template switching is a mutation mechanism that creates reverse-complement copies of sequence regions within a genome by replicating briefly either along the complementary or nascent DNA strand. Depending on the relative positions and context of the four switch points, this process may produce a reverse-complement repeat capable of forming the stem of a perfect DNA hairpin, or fix the base-pairing of an existing stem. Template switching is typically thought to trigger large structural changes and its possible role in the origin and evolution of RNA genes has not been studied. Here we show that the reconstructed ancestral histories of RNA genes contain mutation patterns consistent with the DNA replication-related template switching. In addition to multi-base compensatory mutations, the mechanism can explain complex sequence changes, though mutations breaking the structure rarely get fixed in evolution. Our results suggest a solution for the longstanding dilemma of RNA gene evolution and demonstrate how template switching can both create perfect stems with a single mutation event and help maintaining the stem structure over time. Interestingly, template switching also provides an elegant explanation for the asymmetric base-pair frequencies within RNA stems.",

    "abstract": "Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) compartmentalize vertebrate genomes into sub-Megabase functional neighbourhoods for gene regulation, DNA replication, recombination and repair1-10. TADs are formed by Cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, which compacts the DNA within the domain, followed by blocking of loop extrusion by the CTCF insulator protein at their boundaries11-20. CTCF blocks loop extrusion in an orientation dependent manner, with both experimental and in-silico studies assuming that a single site of static CTCF binding is sufficient to create a stable TAD boundary21-24. Here, we report that most TAD boundaries in mouse cells are modular entities where CTCF binding clusters within extended genomic intervals. Optimized ChIP-seq analysis reveals that this clustering of CTCF binding does not only occur among peaks but also frequently within those peaks. Using a newly developed multi-contact Nano-C assay, we confirm that individual CTCF binding sites additively contribute to TAD separation. This clustering of CTCF binding may counter against the dynamic DNA-binding kinetics of CTCF25-27, which urges a re-evaluation of current models for the blocking of loop extrusion21-23. Our work thus reveals an unanticipatedly complex code of CTCF binding at TAD boundaries that expands the regulatory potential for TAD structure and function and can help to explain how distant non-coding structural variation influences gene regulation, DNA replication, recombination and repair5,28-34.",

    "abstract": "Sunflower seeds (technically achenes) are characterized by a wide spectrum of sizes, shapes, and colors. These traits are genetically correlated with the branching plant architecture loci, which were introgressed into restorer lines to facilitate efficient hybrid production. To break this genetic correlation between branching and seed traits, high resolution mapping of the genes that regulate seed traits is necessary. Recent progress in genomics permits acquisition of comprehensive genotyping data for a large diversity panel, yet a major constraint for exploring the genetic basis of important phenotypes across large diversity panels is the ability to screen and characterize them efficiently. Here, we implement a cost-effective image analysis pipeline to phenotype seed characteristics in a large sunflower diversity panel comprised of 287 individuals that represents most of the genetic variation in cultivated sunflower. A genome-wide association analysis was performed for seed-coat size and shape traits and significant signals were identified around genes regulating phytohormone activity. In addition, significant seed-coat color QTLs were identified and candidate genes that effect pigmentation were detected including a phytomelanin regulating gene on chromosome 17. Finally, QTLs associated with the seed-coat striped pattern were identified and phytohormone regulating candidate genes were detected. The implementation of image analysis phenotyping for GWAS allowed efficient screening of a large diversity panel and identification of valuable genetic factors effecting seed characteristics at the finest resolution to date.",
